I believe two-thirds of the earth's\r\nsurface is covered with water. What people inhabit this water has\r\nalways been a subject of curiosity to the inhabitants of the land.\r\nStrange creatures come from the seas at times, and perhaps in the ocean\r\ndepths are many, more strange than mortal eye has ever gazed upon.\r\n\r\nThis story is fanciful. In it the sea people talk and act much as we\r\ndo, and the mermaids especially are not unlike the fairies with whom\r\nwe have learned to be familiar. Yet they are real sea people, for all\r\nthat, and with the exception of Zog the Magician they are all supposed\r\nto exist in the ocean's depths.\r\n\r\nI am told that some very learned people deny that mermaids or\r\nsea-serpents have ever inhabited the oceans, but it would be very\r\ndifficult for them to prove such an assertion unless they had lived\r\nunder the water as Trot and Cap'n Bill did in this story.\r\n\r\nI hope my readers who have so long followed Dorothy's adventures in the\r\nLand of Oz will be interested in Trot's equally strange experiences.\r\nThe ocean has always appealed to me as a veritable wonderland, and this\r\nstory has been suggested to me many times by my young correspondents in\r\ntheir letters. Indeed, a good many children have implored me to \"write\r\nsomething about the mermaids,\" and I have willingly granted the request.\r\n\r\n    L.

Below them rolled the blue waves of the\r\ngreat Pacific. A little way behind them was the house, a neat frame\r\ncottage painted white and surrounded by huge eucalyptus and pepper\r\ntrees. Still farther behind that--a quarter of a mile distant but built\r\nupon a bend of the coast--was the village, overlooking a pretty bay.\r\n\r\nCap'n Bill and Trot came often to this tree, to sit and watch the ocean\r\nbelow them. The sailor man had one \"meat leg\" and one \"hickory leg,\"\r\nand he often said the wooden one was the best of the two. Once Cap'n\r\nBill had commanded and owned the \"Anemone,\" a trading schooner that\r\nplied along the coast; and in those days Charlie Griffiths, who was\r\nTrot's father, had been the Captain's mate. But ever since Cap'n Bill's\r\naccident, when he lost his leg, Charlie Griffiths had been the captain\r\nof the little schooner while his old master lived peacefully ashore\r\nwith the Griffiths family.\r\n\r\nThis was about the time Trot was born, and the old sailor became very\r\nfond of the baby girl. Her real name was Mayre, but when she grew\r\nbig enough to walk she took so many busy little steps every day that\r\nboth her mother and Cap'n Bill nicknamed her \"Trot,\" and so she was\r\nthereafter mostly called.\r\n\r\nIt was the old sailor who taught the child to love the sea--to love it\r\nalmost as much as he and her father did--and these two, who represented\r\nthe \"beginning and the end of life\" became firm friends and constant\r\ncompanions.\r\n\r\n\"Why hasn't anybody seen a mermaid and lived?\" asked Trot, again.\r\n\r\n\"'Cause mermaids is fairies, an' ain't meant to be seen by us mortal\r\nfolk,\" replied Cap'n Bill.\r\n\r\n\"But if anyone happens to see 'em, what then, Cap'n?\"\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" he answered, slowly wagging his head, \"the mermaids give 'em a\r\nsmile an' a wink, an' they dives into the water an' gets drownded.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TROT]\r\n\r\n\"S'pose they know how to swim, Cap'n Bill?\"\r\n\r\n\"That don't make any diff'rence, Trot. The mermaids live deep down, an'\r\nthe poor mortals never come up again.\"\r\n\r\nThe little girl was thoughtful for a moment.\r\n\r\n\"But why do folks dive in the water when the mermaids smile an' wink?\"\r\nshe asked.\r\n\r\n\"Mermaids,\" he said, gravely, \"is the most beautifulest creatures in\r\nthe world--or the water, either. You know what they're like, Trot;\r\nthey's got a lovely lady's form down to the waist, an' then the other\r\nhalf of 'em's a fish, with green an' purple an' pink scales all adown\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have they got arms, Cap'n Bill?\"\r\n\r\n\"'Course, Trot; arms like any other lady. An' pretty faces that smile\r\nan' look mighty sweet an' fetchin'. Their hair is long an' soft an'\r\nsilky, an' floats all around 'em in the water. When they comes up atop\r\nthe waves they wring the water out 'n their hair and sing songs that\r\ngo right to your heart. If anybody is unlucky enough to be 'round jes'\r\nthen, the beauty o' them mermaids an' their sweet songs charm 'em like\r\nmagic; so's they plunge into the waves to get to the mermaids. But the\r\nmermaids haven't any hearts, Trot, no more 'n a fish has; so they laughs\r\nwhen the poor people drown, an' don't care a fig. That's why I says,\r\nan' I says it true, that nobody never sawr a mermaid an' lived to tell\r\nthe tale.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nobody?\" asked Trot.\r\n\r\n\"Nobody a tall.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then how do you know, Cap'n Bill?\" asked the little girl, looking up\r\ninto his face with big round eyes.\r\n\r\nCap'n Bill coughed. Then he tried to sneeze, to gain time. Then he\r\ntook out his red cotton handkerchief and wiped his bald head with it,\r\nrubbing hard so as to make him think clearer.\r\n\r\n\"Look, Trot; ain't that a brig out there?\" he inquired, pointing to a\r\nsail far out in the sea.\r\n\r\n\"How does anybody know about mermaids, if those who have seen them\r\nnever lived to tell about them?\" she asked again.\r\n\r\n\"Know what about 'em, Trot?\"\r\n\r\n\"About their green and pink scales, and pretty songs, and wet hair.\"\r\n\r\n\"They don't know, I guess. But mermaids jes' natcherly has to be like\r\nthat, or they wouldn't be mermaids.\"\r\n\r\nShe thought this over.\r\n\r\n\"Somebody _must_ have lived, Cap'n Bill,\" she declared, positively.\r\n\"Other fairies have been seen by mortals; why not mermaids?\"\r\n\r\n\"P'raps they have, Trot; p'raps they have,\" he answered, musingly.\r\n\"I'm tellin' you as it was told to me; but I never stopped to inquire\r\ninto the matter so clost, before. Seems like folks wouldn't know so\r\nmuch about mermaids if they hadn't seen 'em; an' yet accordin' to all\r\naccounts the victim is bound to get drownded.\"\r\n\r\n\"P'raps,\" suggested Trot, softly, \"someone found a fotygraph of one of\r\n'em.\"\r\n\r\n\"That might 'a' been, Trot; that might 'a' been,\" answered Cap'n Bill.\r\n\r\nA nice man was Cap'n Bill, and Trot knew he always liked to explain\r\neverything so she could fully understand it. The aged sailor was not a\r\nvery tall man, and some people might have called him chubby, or even\r\nfat. He wore a blue sailor shirt, with white anchors worked on the\r\ncorners of the broad square collar, and his blue trousers were very\r\nwide at the bottom. He always wore one trouser leg over his wooden\r\nlimb and sometimes it would flutter in the wind like a flag, because\r\nit was so wide and the wooden leg so slender. His rough kersey coat\r\nwas a pea-jacket and came down to his waist line. In the big pockets\r\nof his jacket he kept a wonderful jackknife, and his pipe and tobacco,\r\nand many bits of string, and matches and keys and lots of other things.\r\nWhenever Cap'n Bill thrust a chubby hand into one of his pockets Trot\r\nwatched him with breathless interest, for she never knew what he was\r\ngoing to pull out.\r\n\r\nThe old sailor's face was brown as a berry. He had a fringe of hair\r\naround the back of his head and a fringe of whisker around the edge\r\nof his face, running from ear to ear and underneath his chin. His eyes\r\nwere light blue and kind in expression. His nose was big and broad and\r\nhis few teeth were not strong enough to crack nuts with.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTrot liked Cap'n Bill and had a great deal of confidence in his wisdom,\r\nand a great admiration for his ability to make tops and whistles and\r\ntoys with that marvelous jackknife of his. In the village were many\r\nboys and girls of her own age, but she never had as much fun playing\r\nwith them as she had wandering by the sea accompanied by the old sailor\r\nand listening to his fascinating stories.\r\n\r\nShe knew all about the Flying Dutchman, and Davy Jones' Locker, and\r\nCaptain Kidd, and how to harpoon a whale or dodge an iceberg, or lasso\r\na seal. Cap'n Bill had been everywhere in the world, almost, on his\r\nmany voyages. He had been wrecked on desert islands like Robinson\r\nCrusoe and been attacked by cannibals, and had a host of other exciting\r\nadventures. So he was a delightful comrade for the little girl, and\r\nwhatever Cap'n Bill knew Trot was sure to know in time.\r\n\r\n\"How do the mermaids live?\" she asked. \"Are they in caves, or just in\r\nthe water like fishes, or how?\"\r\n\r\n\"Can't say, Trot,\" he replied. \"I've asked divers about that, but none\r\nof 'em ever run acrost a mermaid's nest yet, as I've heard of.\"\r\n\r\n\"If they're fairies,\" she said, \"their homes must be very pretty.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mebbe so, Trot; but damp. They're sure to be damp, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd like to see a mermaid, Cap'n Bill,\" said the child, earnestly.\r\n\r\n\"What, an' git drownded?\" he exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\"No; and live to tell the tale. If they're beautiful, and laughing, and\r\nsweet, there can't be much harm in them, I'm sure.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mermaids is mermaids,\" remarked Cap'n Bill, in his most solemn voice.\r\n\"It wouldn't do us any good to mix up with 'em, Trot.\"\r\n\r\n\"May--re! May--re!\" called a voice from the house.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Mamma!\"\r\n\r\n\"You an' Cap'n Bill come in to supper.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Chap 2._\r\n\r\nTHE MERMAIDS]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next morning, as soon as Trot had helped wipe the breakfast dishes\r\nand put them away in the cupboard, the little girl and Cap'n Bill\r\nstarted out toward the bluff.\r\n\r\nThe air was soft and warm, and the sun turned the edges of the waves\r\ninto sparkling diamonds. Across the bay the last of the fisherboats was\r\nspeeding away out to sea, for well the fishermen knew this was an ideal\r\nday to catch rockbass, barracuda and yellowtail.\r\n\r\nThe old man and the young girl stood on the bluff and watched all this\r\nwith interest. Here was their world.\r\n\r\n\"It isn't a bit rough this morning. Let's have a boat ride, Cap'n\r\nBill,\" said the child.\r\n\r\n\"Suits me to a T,\" declared the sailor.\r\n\r\nSo they found the winding path that led down the face of the cliff to\r\nthe narrow beach below, and cautiously began the descent. Trot never\r\nminded the steep path or the loose rocks at all; but Cap'n Bill's\r\nwooden leg was not so useful on a down grade as on a level, and he had\r\nto be careful not to slip and take a tumble.\r\n\r\nBut by and by they reached the sands and walked to a spot just beneath\r\nthe big acacia tree that grew on the bluff. Halfway to the top of the\r\ncliff hung suspended a little shed like structure that sheltered Trot's\r\nrowboat, for it was necessary to pull the boat out of reach of the\r\nwaves which beat in fury against the rocks at high tide. About as high\r\nup as Cap'n Bill could reach was an iron ring, securely fastened to\r\nthe cliff, and to this ring was tied a rope. The old sailor unfastened\r\nthe knot and began paying out the rope, and the rowboat came out of\r\nits shed and glided slowly downward to the beach. It hung on a pair of\r\ndavits, and was lowered just as a boat is lowered from a ship's side.\r\nWhen it reached the sands the sailor unhooked the ropes and pushed\r\nthe boat to the water's edge. It was a pretty little craft, light and\r\nstrong, and Cap'n Bill knew how to sail it or row it, as Trot might\r\ndesire.\r\n\r\nTo-day they decided to row, so the girl climbed into the bow and her\r\ncompanion stuck his wooden leg into the water's edge, \"so he wouldn't\r\nget his foot wet,\" and pushed off the little boat as he climbed aboard.\r\nThen he seized the oars and began gently paddling.\r\n\r\n\"Whither away, Commodore Trot?\" he asked gaily.\r\n\r\n\"I don't care, Cap'n. It's just fun enough to be on the water,\" she\r\nanswered, trailing one hand overboard.\r\n\r\nSo he rowed around by the North Promontory, where the great caves were,\r\nand much as they were enjoying the ride they soon began to feel the\r\nheat of the sun.\r\n\r\n\"That's Dead Man's Cave, 'cause a skellington was found there,\"\r\nobserved the child, as they passed a dark yawning mouth in the cliff.\r\n\"And that's Bumble Cave, 'cause the bumblebees make nests in the top\r\nof it. And here's Smuggler's Cave, 'cause the smugglers used to hide\r\nthings in it.\"\r\n\r\nShe knew all the caves well, and so did Cap'n Bill. Many of them opened\r\njust at the water's edge and it was possible to row their boat far into\r\ntheir dusky depths.\r\n\r\n\"And here's Echo Cave,\" she continued, dreamily, as they slowly moved\r\nalong the coast; \"and Giant's Cave, and--oh, Cap'n Bill! do you s'pose\r\nthere were ever any giants in that cave?\"\r\n\r\n\"'Pears like there must 'a' been, Trot, or they wouldn't 'a' named it\r\nthat name,\" he replied, pausing to wipe his bald head with the red\r\nhandkerchief, while the oars dragged in the water.\r\n\r\n\"We've never been into that cave, Cap'n,\" she remarked, looking at the\r\nsmall hole in the cliff--an archway through which the water flowed.\r\n\"Let's go in now.\"\r\n\r\n\"What for, Trot?\"\r\n\r\n\"To see if there's a giant there.\"\r\n\r\n\"H-m. Aren't you 'fraid?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; are you? I just don't b'lieve it's big enough for a giant to get\r\ninto.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your father was in there once,\" remarked Cap'n Bill, \"an' he says it's\r\nthe biggest cave on the coast, but low down. It's full o' water, an'\r\nthe water's deep down to the very bottom o' the ocean; but the rock\r\nroof's liable to bump your head at high tide.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's low tide now,\" returned Trot. \"And how could any giant live in\r\nthere if the roof is so low down?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, he couldn't, mate. I reckon they must have called it Giant's Cave\r\n'cause it's so big, an' not 'cause any giant man lived there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let's go in,\" said the girl, again; \"I'd like to 'splore it.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" replied the sailor. \"It'll be cooler in there than out\r\nhere in the sun. We won't go very far, for when the tide turns we\r\nmightn't get out again.\"\r\n\r\nHe picked up the oars and rowed slowly toward the cave. The black\r\narchway that marked its entrance seemed hardly big enough to admit the\r\nboat, at first; but as they drew nearer the opening became bigger. The\r\nsea was very calm here, for the headland shielded it from the breeze.\r\n\r\n\"Look out fer your head, Trot!\" cautioned Cap'n Bill, as the boat\r\nglided slowly into the rocky arch.\r\n\r\nBut it was the sailor who had to duck, instead of the little girl. Only\r\nfor a moment, though. Just beyond the opening the cave was higher, and\r\nas the boat floated into the dim interior they found themselves on\r\nquite an extensive branch of the sea.\r\n\r\nFor a time neither of them spoke and only the soft lapping of the water\r\nagainst the sides of the boat was heard. A beautiful sight met the eyes\r\nof the two adventurers and held them dumb with wonder and delight.\r\n\r\nIt was not dark in this vast cave, yet the light seemed to come from\r\nunderneath the water, which all around them glowed with an exquisite\r\nsapphire color. Where the little waves crept up to the sides of the\r\nrocks they shone like brilliant jewels, and every drop of spray seemed\r\na gem fit to deck a queen.\r\n\r\nTrot leaned her chin on her hands and her elbows on her lap and gazed\r\nat this charming sight with real enjoyment. Cap'n Bill drew in the\r\noars and let the boat drift where it would, while he also sat silently\r\nadmiring the scene.\r\n\r\nSlowly the little craft crept farther and farther into the dim interior\r\nof the vast cavern, while its two passengers feasted their eyes on the\r\nbeauties constantly revealed. Both the old seaman and the little girl\r\nloved the ocean in all its various moods. To them it was a constant\r\ncompanion and a genial comrade. If it stormed and raved they laughed\r\nwith glee; if it rolled great breakers against the shore they clapped\r\ntheir hands joyfully; if it lay slumbering at their feet they petted\r\nand caressed it; but always they loved it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nHere was the ocean yet. It had crept under the dome of overhanging rock\r\nto reveal itself crowned with sapphires and dressed in azure gown,\r\nrevealing in this guise new and unsuspected charms.\r\n\r\n\"Good morning, Mayre,\" said a sweet voice.\r\n\r\nTrot gave a start and looked around her in wonder. Just beside her\r\nin the water were little eddies--circles within circles--such as are\r\ncaused when anything sinks below the surface.\r\n\r\n\"Did--did you hear that, Cap'n Bill?\" she whispered, solemnly.\r\n\r\nCap'n Bill did not answer. He was staring, with eyes that fairly bulged\r\nout, at a place behind Trot's back, and he shook a little, as if\r\ntrembling from cold.\r\n\r\nTrot turned half around--and then she stared, too.\r\n\r\nRising from the blue water was a fair face around which floated a mass\r\nof long, blonde hair. It was a sweet, girlish face, with eyes of the\r\nsame deep blue as the water and red lips whose dainty smile disclosed\r\ntwo rows of pearly teeth. The cheeks were plump and rosy, the brows\r\ngracefully penciled, while the chin was rounded and had a pretty dimple\r\nin it.\r\n\r\n\"The--the--most beauti-ful-est--in all the world!\" murmured Cap'n Bill,\r\nin a voice of horror; \"an' no one has ever lived to--to tell the tale!\"\r\n\r\nThere was a peal of merry laughter, at this; laughter that rippled\r\nand echoed throughout the cavern. Just at Trot's side appeared a new\r\nface--even fairer than the other--with a wealth of brown hair wreathing\r\nthe lovely features. And the eyes smiled kindly into those of the child.\r\n\r\n\"Are you--a--a--mermaid?\" asked Trot, curiously. She was not a bit\r\nafraid. They seemed both gentle and friendly.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, dear,\" was the soft answer.\r\n\r\n\"We are all mermaids!\" chimed a laughing chorus, and here and there,\r\nall about the boat, appeared pretty faces lying just upon the surface\r\nof the water.\r\n\r\n\"Are you part fishes?\" asked Trot, greatly pleased by this wonderful\r\nsight.\r\n\r\n\"No, we are all mermaid,\" replied the one with the brown hair. \"The\r\nfishes are partly like us, because they live in the sea and must move\r\nabout. And you are partly like us, Mayre dear, but have awkward stiff\r\nlegs so you may walk on the land. But the mermaids lived before fishes\r\nand before mankind, so both have borrowed something from us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you must be fairies, if you've lived always,\" remarked Trot,\r\nnodding wisely.\r\n\r\n\"We are, dear; we are the water fairies,\" answered the one with the\r\nblonde hair, coming nearer and rising till her slender white throat\r\nshowed plainly.\r\n\r\n\"We--we're--goners, Trot!\" sighed Cap'n Bill, with a white, woebegone\r\nface.\r\n\r\n\"I guess not, Cap'n,\" she answered calmly. \"These pretty mermaids\r\naren't going to hurt us, I'm sure.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, indeed,\" said the first one who had spoken. \"If we were wicked\r\nenough to wish to harm you our magic could reach you as easily upon\r\nthe land as in this cave. But we love little girls dearly, and wish\r\nonly to please them and make their lives more happy.\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe that!\" cried Trot, earnestly.\r\n\r\nCap'n Bill groaned.\r\n\r\n\"Guess why we have appeared to you,\" said another mermaid, coming to\r\nthe side of the boat.\r\n\r\n\"Why?\" asked the child.\r\n\r\n\"We heard you say yesterday you would like to see a mermaid, and so we\r\ndecided to grant your wish.\"\r\n\r\n\"That was real nice of you,\" said Trot, gratefully.\r\n\r\n\"Also we heard all the foolish things Cap'n Bill said about us,\"\r\nremarked the brown haired one, smilingly; \"and we wanted to prove to\r\nhim they were wrong.\"\r\n\r\n\"I on'y said what I've heard,\" protested Cap'n Bill. \"Never havin' seen\r\na mermaid afore, I couldn't be ackerate; an' I never expected to see\r\none an' live to tell the tale.\"\r\n\r\nAgain the cave rang with merry laughter, and as it died away Trot said:\r\n\r\n\"May I see your scales, please? And are they green and purple and pink,\r\nlike Cap'n Bill said?\"\r\n\r\nThey seemed undecided what to say to this, and swam a little way off,\r\nwhere the beautiful heads formed a group that was delightful to see.\r\nPerhaps they talked together, for the brown haired mermaid soon came\r\nback to the side of the boat and asked:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"We--We're--Goners\"]\r\n\r\n\"Would you like to visit our kingdom, and see all the wonders that\r\nexist below the sea?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd like to,\" replied Trot, promptly; \"but I couldn't. I'd get\r\ndrowned.\"\r\n\r\n\"That you would, mate!\" cried Cap'n Bill.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no,\" said the mermaid. \"We would make you both like one of\r\nourselves, and then you could live within the water as easily as we do.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know as I'd like it,\" said the child; \"at least, for always.\"\r\n\r\n\"You need not stay with us a moment longer than you please,\" returned\r\nthe mermaid, smiling as if amused at the remark. \"Whenever you are\r\nready to return home we promise to bring you to this place again and\r\nrestore to you the same forms you are now wearing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Would I have a fish's tail?\" asked Trot, earnestly.\r\n\r\n\"You would have a mermaid's tail,\" was the reply.\r\n\r\n\"What color would my scales be--pink, or purple?\"\r\n\r\n\"You may choose the color yourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Look a' here, Trot!\" said Cap'n Bill, in excitement, \"you ain't\r\nthinkin' o' doin' such a fool thing, are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"'Course I am,\" declared the little girl. \"We don't get such\r\ninv'tations every day, Cap'n; and if I don't go now I may never find\r\nout how the mermaids live.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't care how they live, myself,\" said Cap'n Bill. \"I jes' want 'em\r\nto let _me_ live.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's no danger,\" insisted Trot.\r\n\r\n\"I do' know 'bout that. That's what all the other folks said when they\r\ndove after the mermaids an' got drownded.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who?\" asked the girl.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know who; but I've heard tell--\"\r\n\r\n\"You've heard that no one ever saw a mermaid and lived,\" said Trot.\r\n\r\n\"To tell the tale,\" he added, nodding. \"An' if we dives down, like they\r\nsays, we won't live ourselves.\"\r\n\r\nAll the mermaids laughed at this, and the brown haired one said:\r\n\r\n\"Well, if you are afraid, don't come. You may row your boat out of this\r\ncave and never see us again, if you like. We merely thought it would\r\nplease little Mayre, and were willing to show her the sights of our\r\nbeautiful home.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd like to see 'em, all right,\" said Trot, her eyes glistening with\r\npleasure.\r\n\r\n\"So would I,\" admitted Cap'n Bill; \"if we would live to tell the tale.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you believe us?\" asked the mermaid, fixing her lovely eyes on\r\nthose of the old sailor and smiling prettily. \"Are you afraid to trust\r\nus to bring you safely back?\"\r\n\r\n\"N--n--n-o,\" said Cap'n Bill; \"'tain't that. I've got to look after\r\nTrot.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you'll have to come with me,\" said Trot, decidedly, \"for I'm\r\ngoing to 'cept this inv'tation. If you don't care to come, Cap'n Bill,\r\nyou go home and tell mother I'm visitin' the mermaids.\"\r\n\r\n\"She'd scold me inter shivers!\" moaned Cap'n Bill, with a shudder. \"I\r\nguess I'd ruther take my chances down below.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right; I'm ready, Miss Mermaid,\" said Trot. \"What shall I do? Jump\r\nin, clothes an' all?\"\r\n\r\n\"Give me your hand, dear,\" answered the mermaid, lifting a lovely white\r\narm from the water. Trot took the slender hand and found it warm and\r\nsoft, and not a bit \"fishy.\"\r\n\r\n\"My name is Clia,\" continued the mermaid, \"and I am a princess in our\r\ndeep-sea kingdom.\"\r\n\r\nJust then Trot gave a flop and flopped right out of the boat into the\r\nwater. Cap'n Bill caught a gleam of pink scales as his little friend\r\nwent overboard, and the next moment there was Trot's face in the water,\r\namong those of the mermaids. She was laughing with glee as she looked\r\nup into Cap'n Bill's face and called:\r\n\r\n\"Come on in, Cap'n! It didn't hurt a bit!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Chap. 3._\r\n\r\n_The_ DEPTHS _of the_ DEEP BLUE SEA]\r\n\r\n\r\nCap'n Bill stood up in the boat as if undecided what to do. Never a\r\nsailorman was more bewildered than this old fellow by the strangeness\r\nof the adventure he had encountered. At first he could hardly believe\r\nit was all true, and that he was not dreaming; but there was Trot in\r\nthe water, laughing with the mermaids and floating comfortably about,\r\nand he couldn't leave his dear little companion to make the trip to the\r\ndepths of the ocean alone.\r\n\r\n\"Take my hand, please, Cap'n Bill,\" said Princess Clia, reaching her\r\ndainty arm toward him; and suddenly the old man took courage and\r\nclasped the soft fingers in his own. He had to lean over the boat to\r\ndo this, and then there came a queer lightness to his legs and he had\r\na great longing to be in the water. So he gave a flop and flopped in\r\nbeside Trot, where he found himself comfortable enough, but somewhat\r\nfrightened.\r\n\r\n\"Law sakes!\" he gasped. \"Here's me in the water with my rheumatics!\r\nI'll be that stiff termorrer I can't wiggle.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're wigglin' all right now,\" observed Trot. \"That's a fine tail\r\nyou've got, Cap'n, an' its green scales is jus' beautiful.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are they green, eh?\" he asked, twisting around to try to see them.\r\n\r\n\"Green as em'ralds, Cap'n. How do they feel?\"\r\n\r\n\"Feel, Trot--feel? Why, this tail beats that ol' wooden leg all holler!\r\nI kin do stunts now that I couldn't 'a' done in a thousand years with\r\nol' peg.\"\r\n\r\n\"And don't be afraid of the rheumatism,\" advised the Princess. \"No\r\nmermaid ever catches cold or suffers pain in the water.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is Cap'n Bill a mermaid now?\" asked Trot.\r\n\r\n\"Why, he's a mer_man_, I suppose,\" laughed the pretty princess. \"But\r\nwhen he gets home he will be just Cap'n Bill again.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wooden leg an' all?\" inquired the child.\r\n\r\n\"To be sure, my dear.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe sailor was now trying his newly-discovered powers of swimming, and\r\nbecame astonished at the feats he could accomplish. He could dart this\r\nway and that with wonderful speed, and turn and dive, and caper about\r\nin the water far better than he had ever been able to do on land--even\r\nbefore he got the wooden leg. And a curious thing about this present\r\nexperience was that the water did not cling to him and wet him, as it\r\nhad always done before. He still wore his flannel shirt and pea-jacket,\r\nand his sailor cap; but although he was in the water, and had been\r\nunderneath the surface, the cloth still seemed dry and warm. As he\r\ndived down and came up again the drops flashed from his head and the\r\nfringe of beard, but he never needed to wipe his face or eyes at all.\r\n\r\nTrot, too, was having queer experiences and enjoying them. When she\r\nducked under water she saw plainly everything around her, as easily and\r\ndistinctly as she had ever seen anything above water. And by looking\r\nover her shoulder she could watch the motion of her new tail, all\r\ncovered with pretty iridescent pink scales, which gleamed like jewels.\r\nShe wore her dress, the same as before, and the water failed to affect\r\nit in the least.\r\n\r\nShe now noticed that the mermaids were clothed, too, and their\r\nexquisite gowns were the loveliest things the little girl had ever\r\nbeheld. They seemed made of a material that was like sheeny silk, cut\r\nlow in the neck and with wide flowing sleeves that seldom covered\r\nthe shapely white arms of her new friends. The gowns had trains that\r\nfloated far behind the mermaids as they swam, but were so fleecy and\r\ntransparent that the sparkle of their scales might be seen reaching\r\nback of their waists, where the human form ended and the fish part\r\nbegan. The sea fairies wore strings of splendid pearls twined around\r\ntheir throats, while more pearls were sewn upon their gowns for\r\ntrimmings. They did not dress their beautiful hair at all, but let it\r\nfloat around them in clouds.\r\n\r\nThe little girl had scarcely time to observe all this when the princess\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"Now, my dear, if you are ready we will begin our journey, for it is a\r\nlong way to our palaces.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" answered Trot, and took the hand extended to her with a\r\ntrustful smile.\r\n\r\n\"Will you allow me to guide you, Cap'n Bill?\" asked the blonde mermaid,\r\nextending her hand to the old sailor.\r\n\r\n\"O' course, ma'am,\" he said, taking her fingers rather bashfully.\r\n\r\n\"My name is Merla,\" she continued, \"and I am cousin to Princess Clia.\r\nWe must all keep together, you know, and I will hold your hand to\r\nprevent your missing the way.\"\r\n\r\nWhile she spoke they began to descend through the water, and it\r\ngrew quite dark for a time because the cave shut out the light. But\r\npresently Trot, who was eagerly looking around her, began to notice the\r\nwater lighten and saw they were coming into brighter parts of the sea.\r\n\r\n\"We have left the cave now,\" said Clia, \"and may swim straight home.\"\r\n\r\n\"I s'pose there are no winding roads in the ocean,\" remarked the child,\r\nswimming swiftly beside her new friend.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, indeed. At the bottom the way is far from being straight or\r\nlevel,\" replied Clia. \"But we are in mid-water now, where nothing will\r\nhinder our journey, unless--\"\r\n\r\nShe seemed to hesitate; so Trot asked: \"Unless what?\"\r\n\r\n\"Unless we meet with disagreeable creatures,\" said the Princess. \"The\r\nmid-water is not as safe as the very bottom, and that is the reason we\r\nare holding your hands.\"\r\n\r\n\"What good would that do?\" asked Trot.\r\n\r\n\"You must remember that we are fairies,\" said Princess Clia. \"For that\r\nreason nothing in the ocean can injure us; but you two are mortals, and\r\ntherefore not entirely safe at all times unless we protect you.\"\r\n\r\nTrot was thoughtful for a few moments and looked around her a little\r\nanxiously. Now and then a dark form would shoot across their pathway,\r\nor pass them at some distance; but none was near enough for the girl to\r\nsee plainly what it might be.\r\n\r\nSuddenly they swam right into a big school of fishes, all yellowtails\r\nand of very large size. There must have been hundreds of them lying\r\nlazily in the water, and when they saw the mermaids they merely wiggled\r\nto one side and opened a path for the sea fairies to pass through.\r\n\r\n\"Will they hurt us?\" asked Trot.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"No, indeed,\" laughed the Princess. \"Fishes are stupid creatures\r\nmostly, and this family is quite harmless.\"\r\n\r\n\"How about sharks?\" asked Cap'n Bill, who was swimming gracefully\r\nbeside them, his hand clutched in that of pretty Merla.\r\n\r\n\"Sharks may indeed be dangerous to you,\" replied Clia; \"so I advise\r\nyou to keep them at a safe distance. They never dare attempt to bite a\r\nmermaid, and it may be they will think you belong to our band; but it\r\nis well to avoid them, if possible.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't get careless, Cap'n,\" added Trot.\r\n\r\n\"I surely won't, mate,\" he replied. \"You see, I didn't use to be 'fraid\r\no' sharks, 'cause if they came near I'd stick my wooden leg at 'em. But\r\nnow, if they happens to fancy these green scales, it's all up with ol'\r\nBill.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never fear,\" said Merla; \"I'll take care of you on our journey, and in\r\nour palaces you will find no sharks at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can't they get in?\" he asked, anxiously.\r\n\r\n\"No. The palaces of the mermaids are inhabited only by themselves.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is there anything else to be afraid of in the sea?\" asked the little\r\ngirl, after they had swum quite a while in silence.\r\n\r\n\"One or two things, my dear,\" answered Princess Clia. \"Of course, we\r\nmermaids have great powers, being fairies; yet among the sea people is\r\none nearly as powerful as we are, and that is the devilfish.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know,\" said Trot; \"I've seen 'em.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have seen the smaller ones, I suppose, which sometimes rise to\r\nthe surface or go near shore, and are often caught by fishermen,\"\r\nsaid Clia; \"but they are only second cousins of the terrible deep-sea\r\ndevilfish to which I refer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Those ones are bad enough, though,\" declared Cap'n Bill. \"If you know\r\nany worse ones I don't want a interduction to 'em.\"\r\n\r\n\"The monster devilfish inhabit caves in the rugged, mountainous regions\r\nof the ocean,\" resumed the Princess, \"and they are evil spirits who\r\ndelight in injuring all who meet them. None lives near our palaces, so\r\nthere is little danger of your meeting any while you are our guests.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope we won't,\" said Trot.\r\n\r\n\"None for me,\" added Cap'n Bill. \"Devils of any sort ought to be give a\r\nwide berth, an' devilfishes is worser ner sea serpents.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, do you know the sea serpents?\" asked Merla, as if surprised.\r\n\r\n\"Not much I don't,\" answered the sailor; \"but I've heard tell of folks\r\nas has seen 'em.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did they ever live to tell the tale?\" asked Trot.\r\n\r\n\"Sometimes,\" he replied. \"They're jes' _or_-ful creatures, mate.\"\r\n\r\n\"How easy it is to be mistaken,\" said Princess Clia, softly. \"We know\r\nthe sea serpents very well, and we like them.\"\r\n\r\n\"You do!\" exclaimed Trot.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, dear. There are only three of them in all the world, and not only\r\nare they harmless, but quite bashful and shy. They are kind-hearted,\r\ntoo, and although not beautiful in appearance, they do many kind deeds\r\nand are generally beloved.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where do they live?\" asked the child.\r\n\r\n\"The oldest one, who is king of this ocean, lives quite near us,\" said\r\nClia. \"His name is Anko.\"\r\n\r\n\"How old is he?\" inquired Cap'n Bill, curiously.\r\n\r\n\"No one knows. He was here before the ocean came, and he stayed\r\nhere because he learned to like the water better than the land as a\r\nhabitation. Perhaps King Anko is ten thousand years old--perhaps twenty\r\nthousand. We often lose track of the centuries down here in the sea.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's pretty old, isn't it,\" said Trot. \"Older than Cap'n Bill, I\r\nguess.\"\r\n\r\n\"Summat,\" chuckled the sailorman; \"summat older, mate; but not much.\r\nP'raps the sea serpent ain't got gray whiskers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes, he has,\" responded Merla, with a laugh. \"And so have his\r\ntwo brothers--Unko and Inko. They each have an ocean of their own,\r\nyou know; and once every hundred years they come here to visit their\r\nbrother Anko. So we've seen all three many times.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, how old are mermaids, then?\" asked Trot, looking around at the\r\nbeautiful creatures wonderingly.\r\n\r\n\"We are like all ladies of uncertain age,\" rejoined the Princess, with\r\na smile. \"We don't care to tell.\"\r\n\r\n\"Older than Cap'n Bill?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, dear,\" said Clia.\r\n\r\n\"But we haven't any gray whiskers,\" added Merla, merrily, \"and our\r\nhearts are ever young.\"\r\n\r\nTrot was thoughtful. It made her feel solemn to be in the company of\r\nsuch old people. The band of mermaids seemed, to all appearances,\r\nyoung and fresh and not a bit as if they'd been soaked in water for\r\nhundreds of years. The girl began to take more notice of the sea\r\nmaidens following after her. More than a dozen were in the group; all\r\nvery lovely in appearance and clothed in the same gauzy robes as Merla\r\nand the princess. These attendants did not join in the conversation,\r\nbut darted here and there in sportive play, and often Trot heard the\r\ntinkling chorus of their laughter. Whatever doubts might have arisen in\r\nthe child's mind, through the ignorant tales of her sailor friend, she\r\nnow found the mermaids to be light-hearted, joyous and gay, and from\r\nthe first she had not been in the least afraid of her new companions.\r\n\r\n\"How much farther do we have to go?\" asked Cap'n Bill, presently.\r\n\r\n\"Are you getting tired?\" Merla inquired.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said he; \"but I'm sorter anxious to see what your palaces look\r\nlike. Inside the water ain't as interestin' as the top of it. It's fine\r\nswimmin', I'll agree; an' I like it; but there ain't nuthin' special to\r\nsee, that I can make out.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is true, sir,\" replied the Princess. \"We have purposely led you\r\nthrough the mid-water, hoping you would see nothing to alarm you until\r\nyou get more accustomed to our ocean life. Moreover, we are able to\r\ntravel more swiftly here. How far do you think we have already come,\r\nCap'n?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, 'bout two mile,\" he answered.\r\n\r\n\"Well, we are now hundreds of miles from the cave where we started,\"\r\nshe told him.\r\n\r\n\"You don't mean it!\" he exclaimed, in wonder.\r\n\r\n\"Then there's magic in it,\" announced Trot, soberly.\r\n\r\n\"True, my dear. To avoid tiring you, and to save time, we have used\r\na little of our fairy power,\" said Clia. \"The result is that we are\r\nnearing our home. Let us go downward a bit, now, for you must know that\r\nthe mermaid palaces are at the very bottom of the ocean--and in its\r\ndeepest part.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The PALACE OF QUEEN AQUARINE\r\n\r\nChap. 4]\r\n\r\n\r\nTrot was surprised to find it was not at all dark or gloomy as they\r\ndescended farther into the deep sea. Things were not quite so clear\r\nto her eyes as they had been in the bright sunshine above the ocean's\r\nsurface, but every object was distinct, nevertheless, as if she saw it\r\nthrough a pane of green tinted glass. The water was very clear, except\r\nfor this green shading, and the little girl had never before felt so\r\nlight and buoyant as she did now. It was no effort at all to dart\r\nthrough the water, which seemed to support her on all sides.\r\n\r\n\"I don't believe I weigh anything at all,\" she told Cap'n Bill.\r\n\r\n\"No more do I, Trot,\" said he. \"But that's nat'ral, seein' as we're\r\nunder water so far. What bothers me most is how we manage to breathe,\r\nhavin' no gills, like fishes have.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you sure we haven't any gills?\" she asked, lifting her free hand\r\nto feel her throat.\r\n\r\n\"Sure. Ner the mermaids haven't any, either,\" declared Cap'n Bill.\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" said Trot, \"we're breathing by magic.\"\r\n\r\nThe mermaids laughed at this shrewd remark, and the Princess said:\r\n\r\n\"You have guessed correctly, my dear. Go a little slower, now, for the\r\npalaces are in sight.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where?\" asked Trot, eagerly.\r\n\r\n\"Just before you.\"\r\n\r\n\"In that grove of trees?\" inquired the girl. And, really, it seemed to\r\nher they were approaching a beautiful grove.\r\n\r\nThe bottom of the sea was covered with white sand, in which grew many\r\nvarieties of sea shrubs with branches like those of trees. Not all of\r\nthem were green, however, for the branches and leaves were of a variety\r\nof gorgeous colors. Some were purple, shading down to light lavender;\r\nand there were reds all the way from a delicate rose-pink to vivid\r\nshades of scarlet. Orange, yellow and blue shades were there, too,\r\nmingling with the sea-greens in a most charming manner. Altogether,\r\nTrot found the brilliant coloring somewhat bewildering.\r\n\r\nThese sea shrubs, which in size were quite as big and tall as the trees\r\non earth, were set so close together that their branches entwined; but\r\nthere were several avenues leading into the groves, and at the entrance\r\nto each avenue the girl noticed several large fishes, with long spikes\r\ngrowing upon their noses.\r\n\r\n\"These are swordfishes,\" remarked the Princess, as she led the band\r\npast one of these avenues.\r\n\r\n\"Are they dang'rous?\" asked Trot.\r\n\r\n\"Not to us,\" was the reply. \"The swordfishes are among our most valued\r\nand faithful servants, guarding the entrances to the gardens which\r\nsurround our palaces. If any creatures try to enter uninvited these\r\nguards fight them and drive them away. Their swords are sharp and\r\nstrong, and they are fierce fighters, I assure you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've known 'em to attack ships, an' stick their swords right through\r\nthe wood,\" said Cap'n Bill.\r\n\r\n\"Those belonged to the wandering tribes of swordfishes,\" explained\r\nthe Princess. \"These, who are our servants, are too sensible and\r\nintelligent to attack ships.\"\r\n\r\nThe band now headed into a broad passage through the \"gardens,\" as\r\nthe mermaids called these gorgeous groves, and the great swordfishes\r\nguarding the entrance made way for them to pass, afterward resuming\r\ntheir posts with round and watchful eyes. As they slowly swam along\r\nthe avenue Trot noticed that some of the bushes seemed to have fruits\r\ngrowing upon them; but what these fruits might be, neither she nor\r\nCap'n Bill could guess.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe way wound here and there for some distance, till finally they\r\ncame to a more open space, all carpeted with sea flowers of exquisite\r\ncolorings. Although Trot did not know it, these flowers resembled the\r\nrare orchids of earth in their fanciful shapes and marvelous hues.\r\nThe child did not examine them very closely, for across the carpet of\r\nflowers loomed the magnificent and extensive palaces of the mermaids.\r\n\r\nThese palaces were built of coral; white, pink and yellow being used,\r\nand the colors arranged in graceful designs. The front of the main\r\npalace, which now faced them, had circular ends connecting the straight\r\nwall, not unlike the architecture we are all familiar with; yet there\r\nseemed to be no windows to the building, although a series of archways\r\nserved as doors.\r\n\r\nArriving at one of the central archways the band of sea maidens\r\nseparated, Princess Clia and Merla leading Trot and Cap'n Bill into\r\nthe palace, while the other mermaids swam swiftly away to their own\r\nquarters.\r\n\r\n\"Welcome!\" said Clia, in her sweet voice. \"Here you are surrounded only\r\nby friends and are in perfect safety. Please accept our hospitality as\r\nfreely as you desire, for we consider you honored guests. I hope you\r\nwill like our home,\" she added, a little shyly.\r\n\r\n\"We are sure to, dear Princess,\" Trot hastened to say.\r\n\r\nThen Clia escorted them through the archway and into a lofty hall.\r\nIt was not a mere grotto, but had smoothly built walls of pink coral\r\ninlaid with white. Trot at first thought there was no roof, for looking\r\nupward she could see the water all above them. But the princess,\r\nreading her thought, said with a smile:\r\n\r\n\"Yes, there is a roof, or we would be unable to keep all the sea people\r\nout of our palace. But the roof is made of glass, to admit the light.\"\r\n\r\n\"Glass!\" cried the astonished child. \"Then it must be an awful big pane\r\nof glass.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is,\" agreed Clia. \"Our roofs are considered quite wonderful, and we\r\nowe them to the fairy powers of our queen. Of course, you understand\r\nthere is no natural way to make glass under water.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, indeed,\" said Cap'n Bill. And then he asked: \"Does your queen live\r\nhere?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. She is waiting now, in her throne room, to welcome you. Shall we\r\ngo in?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd just as soon,\" replied Trot, rather timidly; but she boldly\r\nfollowed the princess, who glided through another arch into a small\r\nroom, where several mermaids were reclining upon couches of coral. They\r\nwere beautifully dressed and wore many sparkling jewels.\r\n\r\n\"Her Majesty is awaiting the strangers, Princess Clia,\" announced one\r\nof these. \"You are asked to enter at once.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come, then,\" said Clia, and once more taking Trot's hand she led the\r\ngirl through still another arch, while Merla followed just behind them,\r\nescorting Cap'n Bill.\r\n\r\nThey now entered an apartment so gorgeous that the child fairly gasped\r\nwith astonishment. The queen's throne room was indeed the grandest and\r\nmost beautiful chamber in all the ocean palaces. Its coral walls were\r\nthickly inlaid with mother-of-pearl, exquisitely shaded and made into\r\nborders and floral decorations. In the corners were cabinets, upon the\r\nshelves of which many curious shells were arranged, all beautifully\r\npolished. The floor glittered with gems arranged in patterns of\r\nflowers, like a brilliant carpet.\r\n\r\nNear the center of the room was a raised platform of mother-of-pearl\r\nupon which stood a couch thickly studded with diamonds, rubies,\r\nemeralds and pearls. Here reclined Queen Aquareine, a being so lovely\r\nthat Trot gazed upon her spellbound and Cap'n Bill took off his sailor\r\ncap and held it in his hands.\r\n\r\nAll about the room were grouped other mother-of-pearl couches, not\r\nraised like that of the queen, and upon each of these reclined a pretty\r\nmermaid. They could not sit down as we do, Trot readily understood,\r\nbecause of their tails; but they rested very gracefully upon the\r\ncouches, with their trailing gauzy robes arranged in fleecy folds.\r\n\r\nWhen Clia and Merla escorted the strangers down the length of the great\r\nroom toward the royal throne they met with pleasant looks and smiles on\r\nevery side, for the sea maidens were too polite to indulge in curious\r\nstares. They paused just before the throne, and the queen raised her\r\nhead upon one elbow to observe them.\r\n\r\n\"Welcome, Mayre,\" she said; \"and welcome, Cap'n Bill. I trust you are\r\npleased with your glimpse of the life beneath the surface of the sea.\"\r\n\r\n\"_I_ am,\" answered Trot, looking admiringly at the beautiful face of\r\nthe queen.\r\n\r\n\"It's all mighty cur'ous an' strange like,\" said the sailor, slowly.\r\n\"I'd no idee you mermaids were like this, at all!\"\r\n\r\n\"Allow me to explain that it was to correct your wrong ideas about us\r\nthat led me to invite you to visit us,\" replied the Queen. \"We usually\r\npay little heed to the earth people, for we are content in our own\r\ndominions; but, of course, we know all that goes on upon your earth.\r\nSo, when Princess Clia chanced to overhear your absurd statements\r\nconcerning us, we were greatly amused and decided to let you see, with\r\nyour own eyes, just what we are like.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm glad you did,\" answered Cap'n Bill, dropping his eyes in some\r\nconfusion as he remembered his former description of the mermaids.\r\n\r\n\"Now that you are here,\" continued the Queen, in a cordial, friendly\r\ntone, \"you may as well remain with us a few days and see the wonderful\r\nsights of our ocean.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm much obliged to you, ma'am,\" said Trot; \"and I'd like to stay,\r\never so much; but mother worries jus' dreadful if we don't get home in\r\ntime.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll arrange all that,\" said Aquareine, with a smile.\r\n\r\n\"How?\" asked the girl.\r\n\r\n\"I will make your mother forget the passage of time, so she will not\r\nrealize how long you are away. Then she cannot worry.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can you do that?\" inquired Trot.\r\n\r\n\"Very easily. I will send your mother into a deep sleep that will last\r\nuntil you are ready to return home. Just at present she is seated in\r\nher chair by the front window, engaged in knitting.\" The queen paused\r\nto raise an arm and wave it slowly to and fro. Then she added: \"Now\r\nyour good mother is asleep, little Mayre, and instead of worries I\r\npromise her pleasant dreams.\"\r\n\r\n\"Won't somebody rob the house while she's asleep?\" asked the child\r\nanxiously.\r\n\r\n\"No, dear. My charm will protect the house from any intrusion.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"That's fine!\" exclaimed Trot in delight.\r\n\r\n\"It's jes' won-erful!\" said Cap'n Bill. \"I wish I knew it was so.\r\nTrot's mother has a awful sharp tongue when she's worrited.\"\r\n\r\n\"You may see for yourselves,\" declared the Queen, and waved her hand\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nAt once they saw before them the room in the cottage, with Mayre's\r\nmother asleep by the window. Her knitting was in her lap and the cat\r\nlay curled up beside her chair. It was all so natural that Trot thought\r\nshe could hear the clock over the fireplace tick. After a moment the\r\nscene faded away, when the queen asked with another smile: \"Are you\r\nsatisfied?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes!\" cried Trot. \"But how could you do it?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a form of mirage,\" was the reply. \"We are able to bring any\r\nearth scene before us whenever we wish. Sometimes these scenes are\r\nreflected above the water, so that mortals also observe them.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've seen 'em,\" said Cap'n Bill, nodding. \"I've seen mirages; but I\r\nnever knowed what caused 'em, afore now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whenever you see anything you do not understand, and wish to ask\r\nquestions, I will be very glad to answer them,\" said the Queen.\r\n\r\n\"One thing that bothers me,\" said Trot, \"is why we don't get wet, being\r\nin the ocean with water all around us.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is because no water really touches you,\" explained the Queen.\r\n\"Your bodies have been made just like those of the mermaids, in\r\norder that you may fully enjoy your visit to us. One of our peculiar\r\nqualities is that water is never permitted to quite touch our bodies,\r\nor our gowns. Always there remains a very small space, hardly a hair's\r\nbreadth between us and the water, which is the reason we are always\r\nwarm and dry.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"I see,\" said Trot. \"That's why you don't get soggy, or withered.\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly,\" laughed the Queen, and the other mermaids joined in her\r\nmerriment.\r\n\r\n\"I s'pose that's how we can breathe without gills,\" remarked Cap'n\r\nBill, thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\"Yes; the air space is constantly replenished from the water, which\r\ncontains air, and this enables us to breathe as freely as you do upon\r\nthe earth.\"\r\n\r\n\"But we have fins,\" said Trot, looking at the fin that stood upright on\r\nCap'n Bill's back.\r\n\r\n\"Yes; they allow us to guide ourselves as we swim, and so are very\r\nuseful,\" replied the Queen.\r\n\r\n\"They make us more finished,\" said Cap'n Bill, with a chuckle. Then,\r\nsuddenly becoming grave, he asked: \"How 'bout my rheumatics, ma'am?\r\nAin't I likely to get stiffened up with all this dampness?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, indeed,\" Aquareine answered; \"there is no such thing as rheumatism\r\nin all our dominions. I promise no evil result shall follow this visit\r\nto us, so please be as happy and contented as possible.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Chap 5._\r\n\r\nTHE SEA SERPENT]\r\n\r\n\r\nJust then Trot happened to look up at the glass roof and saw a\r\nstartling sight. A big head, with a face surrounded by stubby gray\r\nwhiskers, was poised just over them, and the head was connected with a\r\nlong, curved body that looked much like a sewer pipe.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, there is King Anko,\" said the Queen, following the child's gaze.\r\n\"Open a door and let him in, Clia, for I suppose our old friend is\r\nanxious to see the earth people.\"\r\n\r\n\"Won't he hurt us?\" asked the little girl, with a shiver of fear.\r\n\r\n\"Who, Anko? Oh, no, my dear! We are very fond of the sea serpent, who\r\nis king of this ocean, although he does not rule the mermaids. Old Anko\r\nis a very agreeable fellow, as you will soon discover.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can he talk?\" asked Trot.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, indeed.\"\r\n\r\n\"And can we understand what he says?\"\r\n\r\n\"Perfectly,\" replied the Queen. \"I have given you power, while you\r\nremain here, to understand the language of every inhabitant of the sea.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's nice,\" said Trot, gratefully.\r\n\r\nThe Princess Clia swam slowly to one of the walls of the throne room\r\nwhere, at a wave of her hand, a round hole appeared in the coral. The\r\nsea serpent at once observed this opening and the head left the roof\r\nof glass only to reappear presently at the round hole. Through this he\r\nslowly crawled, until his head was just beneath the throne of Queen\r\nAquareine, who said to him:\r\n\r\n\"Good morning, your Majesty. I hope you are quite well?\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite well, thank your Majesty,\" answered Anko; and then he turned to\r\nthe strangers. \"I suppose these are the earth folks you were expecting?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" returned the Queen; \"the girl is named Mayre, and the man Cap'n\r\nBill.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the sea serpent looked at the visitors they ventured to look\r\nat him. He certainly was a queer creature, yet Trot decided he was\r\nnot at all frightful. His head was round as a ball, but his ears were\r\nsharp pointed and had tassels at the ends of them. His nose was flat\r\nand his mouth very wide indeed, but his eyes were blue and gentle in\r\nexpression. The white, stubby hairs that surrounded his face were not\r\nthick, like a beard, but scattered and scraggly. From the head, the\r\nlong brown body of the sea serpent extended to the hole in the coral\r\nwall, which was just big enough to admit it, and how much more of the\r\nbody remained outside the child could not tell. On the back of the body\r\nwere several fins, which made the creature look more like an eel than a\r\nserpent.\r\n\r\n\"The girl is young and the man is old,\" said King Anko, in a soft\r\nvoice. \"But I'm quite sure Cap'n Bill isn't as old as I am.\"\r\n\r\n\"How old are you?\" asked the sailor.\r\n\r\n\"I can't say, exactly. I can remember several thousands of years back,\r\nbut beyond that my memory fails me. How's your memory, Cap'n Bill?\"\r\n\r\n\"You've got me beat,\" was the reply. \"I'll give in that you're older\r\nthan I am.\"\r\n\r\nThis seemed to please the sea serpent.\r\n\r\n\"Are you well?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Pretty fair,\" said Cap'n Bill. \"How's yourself?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I'm very well, thank you,\" answered Anko. \"I never remember to\r\nhave had a pain but three times in my life. The last time was when\r\nJulius Sneezer was on earth.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean Julius Cæsar,\" said Trot, correcting him.\r\n\r\n\"No; I mean Julius Sneezer,\" insisted the Sea Serpent. \"That was his\r\nreal name--Sneezer. They called him Cæsar sometimes, just because he\r\ntook everything he could lay hands on. I ought to know, because I saw\r\nhim when he was alive. Did you see him when he was alive, Cap'n Bill?\"\r\n\r\n\"I reckon not,\" admitted the sailor.\r\n\r\n\"That time I had a toothache,\" continued Anko; \"but I got a lobster to\r\npull the tooth with his claw, so the pain was soon over.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did it hurt to pull it?\" asked Trot.\r\n\r\n\"Hurt!\" exclaimed the Sea Serpent, groaning at the recollection. \"My\r\ndear, those creatures have been called lobsters ever since! The second\r\npain I had way back in the time of Nevercouldnever.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I s'pose you mean Nebuchadnezzar,\" said Trot.\r\n\r\n\"Do you call him that, now?\" asked the Sea Serpent, as if surprised.\r\n\"He used to be called Nevercouldnever when he was alive, but this\r\nnew way of spelling seems to get everything mixed up. Nebuchadnezzar\r\ndoesn't mean anything at all, it seems to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"It means he ate grass,\" said the child.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no; he didn't,\" declared the Sea Serpent. \"He was the first to\r\ndiscover that lettuce was good to eat, and he became very fond of it.\r\nThe people may have called it grass, but they were wrong. I ought to\r\nknow, because I was alive when Nevercouldnever lived. Were you alive,\r\nthen?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Trot.\r\n\r\n\"The pain I had then,\" remarked Anko, \"was caused by a kink in my tail,\r\nabout three hundred feet from the end. There was an old octopus who did\r\nnot like me, and so he tied a knot in my tail when I wasn't looking.\"\r\n\r\n\"What did you do?\" asked Cap'n Bill.\r\n\r\n\"Well, first I transformed the octopus into a jelly fish, and then I\r\nwaited for the tide to turn. When my tail was untied the pain stopped.\"\r\n\r\n\"I--I don't understand that,\" said Trot, somewhat bewildered.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, my dear,\" replied the Sea Serpent, in a grateful voice.\r\n\"People who are always understood are very common. You are sure to\r\nrespect those you can't understand, for you feel that perhaps they know\r\nmore than you do.\"\r\n\r\n\"About how long do you happen to be?\" inquired Cap'n Bill.\r\n\r\n\"When last measured, I was seven thousand four hundred and eighty-two\r\nfeet, five inches and a quarter. I'm not sure about the quarter, but\r\nthe rest is probably correct. Adam measured me when Cain was a baby.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where's the rest of you, then?\" asked Trot.\r\n\r\n\"Safe at home, I hope, and coiled up in my parlor,\" answered the Sea\r\nSerpent. \"When I go out I usually take along only what is needed. It\r\nsaves a lot of bother and I can always find my way back in the darkest\r\nnight, by just coiling up the part that has been away.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you like to be a sea serpent?\" inquired the child.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"Yes, for I'm King of my Ocean, and there is no other sea serpent to\r\nimagine he is just as good as I am. I have two brothers who live in\r\nother oceans, but one is seven inches shorter than I am, and the other\r\nseveral feet shorter. It's curious to talk about feet when we haven't\r\nany feet, isn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Seems so,\" acknowledged Trot.\r\n\r\n\"I feel I have much to be proud of,\" continued Anko, in a dreamy tone;\r\n\"my great age, my undisputed sway, and my exceptional length.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't b'lieve I'd care to live so long,\" remarked Cap'n Bill,\r\nthoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\"So long as seven thousand four hundred and eighty-two feet, five\r\ninches and a quarter?\" asked the Sea Serpent.\r\n\r\n\"No; I mean so many years,\" replied the sailor.\r\n\r\n\"But what can one do, if one happens to be a sea serpent?\" Anko\r\ninquired. \"There is nothing in the sea that can hurt me, and I cannot\r\ncommit suicide because we have no carbolic acid, or firearms, or gas to\r\nturn on. So it isn't a matter of choice, and I'd about as soon be alive\r\nas dead. It does not seem quite so monotonous, you know. But I guess\r\nI've stayed about long enough; so I'll go home to dinner. Come and see\r\nme, when you have time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you,\" said Trot; and Merla added:\r\n\r\n\"I'll take you over to his majesty's palace when we go out, and let you\r\nsee how he lives.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, do,\" said Anko; and then he slowly slid out of the hole, which\r\nimmediately closed behind him, leaving the coral wall as solid as\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" exclaimed Trot; \"King Anko forgot to tell us what the third pain\r\nwas about.\"\r\n\r\n\"So he did,\" said Cap'n Bill. \"We must ask him about that, when we\r\nsee him. But I guess the ol' boy's mem'ry is failin', an' he can't be\r\ndepended on for pertic'lars.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Chap. 6._\r\n\r\nEXPLORING THE OCEAN]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe queen now requested her guests to recline upon couches, that they\r\nmight rest themselves from their long swim and talk more at their ease.\r\nSo the girl and the sailor allowed themselves to float downward until\r\nthey rested their bodies on two of the couches nearest the throne,\r\nwhich were willingly vacated for them by the mermaids who had occupied\r\nthem until then.\r\n\r\nThe visitors soon found themselves answering a great many questions\r\nabout their life on the earth, for, although the queen had said she\r\nkept track of what was going on on the land, there were many details of\r\nhuman life in which all the mermaids seemed greatly interested.\r\n\r\nDuring the conversation several sea-maids came swimming into the room,\r\nbearing trays of sea apples and other fruit, which they first offered\r\nto the queen and then passed the refreshments around to the company\r\nassembled. Trot and Cap'n Bill each took some, and the little girl\r\nfound the fruits delicious to eat, as they had a richer flavor than\r\nany that grew upon land. Queen Aquareine was much pleased when the old\r\nsailor asked for more, but Merla warned him dinner would soon be served\r\nand he must take care not to spoil his appetite for that meal.\r\n\r\n\"Our dinner is at noon, for we have to cook in the middle of the day,\r\nwhen the sun is shining,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Cook!\" cried Trot; \"why, you can't build a fire in the water, can you?\"\r\n\r\n\"We have no need of fires,\" was the reply. \"The glass roof of our\r\nkitchen is so curved that it concentrates the heat of the sun's rays,\r\nwhich are then hot enough to cook anything we wish.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how do you get along if the day is cloudy, and the sun doesn't\r\nshine?\" inquired the little girl.\r\n\r\n\"Then we use the hot springs that bubble up in another part of the\r\npalace,\" Merla answered. \"But the sun is the best to cook by.\"\r\n\r\nSo, it was no surprise to Trot when, about noon, dinner was announced\r\nand all the mermaids, headed by their queen and their guests, swam into\r\nanother spacious room where a great, long table was laid. The dishes\r\nwere of polished gold and dainty cut glass, and the cloth and napkins\r\nof fine gossamer. Around the table were ranged rows of couches for the\r\nmermaids to recline upon as they ate. Only the nobility and favorites\r\nof Queen Aquareine were invited to partake of this repast, for Clia\r\nexplained that tables were set for the other mermaids in different\r\nparts of the numerous palaces.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTrot wondered who would serve the meal, but her curiosity was soon\r\nsatisfied when several large lobsters came sliding into the room,\r\nbackward, bearing in their claws trays loaded with food. Each of these\r\nlobsters had a golden band around its neck to show it was the slave of\r\nthe mermaids.\r\n\r\nThese curious waiters were fussy creatures and Trot found much\r\namusement in watching their odd motions. They were so spry and\r\nexcitable that, at times, they ran against one another and upset the\r\nplatters of food, after which they began to scold and argue as to whose\r\nfault it was, until one of the mermaids quietly rebuked them and asked\r\nthem to be more quiet and more careful.\r\n\r\nThe queen's guests had no cause to complain of the dinner provided.\r\nFirst the lobsters served bowls of turtle soup, which proved hot and\r\ndeliciously flavored. Then came salmon steaks fried in fish oil, with\r\na fungus bread that tasted much like field mushrooms. Oysters, clams,\r\nsoft-shell crabs and various preparations of sea foods followed. The\r\nsalad was a delicate leaf from some seaweed that Trot thought was\r\nmuch nicer than lettuce. Several courses were served and the lobsters\r\nchanged the plates with each course, chattering and scolding as they\r\nworked, and as Trot said, \"doing everything backwards\" in their\r\nnervous, fussy way.\r\n\r\nMany of the things offered them to eat were unknown to the visitors,\r\nand the child was suspicious of some of them; but Cap'n Bill asked no\r\nquestions and ate everything offered him, so Trot decided to follow\r\nhis example. Certain it is they found the meal very satisfying, and\r\nevidently there was no danger of their being hungry while they remained\r\nthe guests of the mermaids. When the fruits came, Trot thought that\r\nmust be the last course of the big dinner, but, following the fruits\r\nwere ice creams frozen into the shapes of flowers.\r\n\r\n\"How funny,\" said the child, \"to be eating ice cream at the bottom of\r\nthe sea!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why does that surprise you?\" inquired the Queen.\r\n\r\n\"I can't see where you get the ice to freeze it,\" Trot replied.\r\n\r\n\"It is brought to us from the icebergs that float in the northern parts\r\nof the ocean,\" explained Merla.\r\n\r\n\"O' course, Trot; you orter thought o' that; I did,\" said Cap'n Bill.\r\n\r\nThe little girl was glad there was no more to eat, for she was ashamed\r\nto feel she had eaten every morsel she could. Her only excuse for being\r\nso greedy was that \"ev'rything tasted just splendid!\" as she told the\r\nqueen.\r\n\r\n\"And now,\" said Aquareine, \"I will send you out for a swim with Merla,\r\nwho will show you some of the curious sights of our sea. You need\r\nnot go far this afternoon, and when you return we will have another\r\ninteresting talk together.\"\r\n\r\nSo the blonde mermaid led Trot and Cap'n Bill outside the palace walls,\r\nwhere they found themselves in the pretty flower gardens.\r\n\r\n\"I'd feel all right, mate, if I could have a smoke,\" remarked the old\r\nsailor to the child; \"but that's a thing as can't be did here in the\r\nwater.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\" asked Merla, who overheard him.\r\n\r\n\"A pipe has to be lighted, an' a match wouldn't burn,\" he replied.\r\n\r\n\"Try it,\" suggested the mermaid. \"I do not mind your smoking at all, if\r\nit will give you pleasure.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a bad habit I've got, an' I'm too old to break myself of it,\"\r\nsaid Cap'n Bill. Then he felt in the big pockets of his coat and took\r\nout a pipe and a bag of tobacco. After he had carefully filled his\r\npipe, rejoicing in the fact that the tobacco was not at all wet, he\r\ntook out his match box and struck a light. The match burned brightly\r\nand soon the sailor was puffing the smoke from his pipe in great\r\ncontentment. The smoke ascended through the water in the shape of\r\nbubbles and Trot wondered what anyone who happened to be floating upon\r\nthe surface of the ocean would think to see smoke coming from the water.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I find I can smoke, all right,\" remarked Cap'n Bill; \"but it\r\nbothers me to understand why.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is because of the air space existing between the water and\r\neverything you have about you,\" explained Merla. \"But now, if you will\r\ncome this way, I will take you to visit some of our neighbors.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThey passed over the carpet of sea flowers, the gorgeous blossoms\r\nswaying on their stems as the motion of the people in the water above\r\nthem disturbed their repose, and presently the three entered the dense\r\nshrubbery surrounding the palaces. They had not proceeded far when they\r\ncame to a clearing among the bushes, and here Merla paused.\r\n\r\nTrot and Cap'n Bill paused, too, for floating in the clear water was a\r\ngroup of beautiful shapes that the child thought looked like molds of\r\nwine jelly. They were round as a dinner plate, soft and transparent,\r\nbut tinted in such lovely hues that no artist's brush has ever been\r\nable to imitate them. Some were deep sapphire blue; others rose pink;\r\nstill others a delicate topaz color. They seemed to have neither heads,\r\neyes nor ears, yet it was easy to see they were alive and able to float\r\nin any direction they wished to go. In shape they resembled inverted\r\nflowerpots, with the upper edges fluted, and from the centers floated\r\nwhat seemed to be bouquets of flowers.\r\n\r\n\"How pretty!\" exclaimed Trot, enraptured by the sight.\r\n\r\n\"Yes; this is a rare variety of jellyfish,\" replied Merla. \"The\r\ncreatures are not so delicate as they appear, and live for a long\r\ntime--unless they get too near the surface and the waves wash them\r\nashore.\"\r\n\r\nAfter watching the jellyfish a few moments they followed Merla through\r\nthe grove and soon a low chant, like that of an Indian song, fell upon\r\ntheir ears. It was a chorus of many small voices, and grew louder\r\nas they swam on. Presently a big rock rose suddenly before them from\r\nthe bottom of the sea, rearing its steep side far up into the water\r\noverhead, and this rock was thickly covered with tiny shells that clung\r\nfast to its surface. The chorus they heard appeared to come from these\r\nshells, and Merla said to her companions:\r\n\r\n\"These are the singing barnacles. They are really very amusing, and if\r\nyou listen carefully you can hear what they say.\"\r\n\r\nSo Trot and Cap'n Bill listened, and this was what the barnacles sang:\r\n\r\n    \"_We went to topsy-turvy land to see a man-o'-war,\r\n    And we were much attached to it, because we simply were;\r\n    We found an anchor-ite within the mud upon the lea\r\n    For the ghost of Jonah's whale he ran away and went to sea.\r\n                    Oh, it was awful!\r\n                    It was unlawful!\r\n    We rallied round the flag in sev'ral millions;\r\n                    They couldn't shake us;\r\n                    They had to take us;\r\n    So the halibut and cod they danced cotillions._\"\r\n\r\n\"What does it all mean?\" asked Trot.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose they refer to the way barnacles have of clinging to ships,\"\r\nreplied Merla; \"but usually their songs mean nothing at all. The little\r\nbarnacles haven't many brains, so we usually find their songs quite\r\nstupid.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do they write comic operas?\" asked the child.\r\n\r\n\"I think not,\" answered the mermaid.\r\n\r\n\"They seem to like the songs themselves,\" remarked Cap'n Bill.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes; they sing all day long. But it never matters to them whether\r\ntheir songs mean anything or not. Let us go in this direction and visit\r\nsome other sea people.\"\r\n\r\nSo they swam away from the barnacle-covered rock and Trot heard the\r\nlast chorus as she slowly followed their conductor. The barnacles were\r\nsinging:\r\n\r\n                    \"_Oh, very well, then,\r\n                    I hear the curfew,\r\n    Please go away and come some other day;\r\n                    Goliath tussels\r\n                    With Samson's muscles,\r\n    Yet the muscles never fight in Oyster Bay._\"\r\n\r\n\"It's jus' nonsense!\" said Trot, scornfully. \"Why don't they sing\r\n'Annie Laurie,' or 'Home, Sweet Home,' or else keep quiet?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, if they were quiet,\" replied Merla, \"they wouldn't be singing\r\nbarnacles.\"\r\n\r\nThey now came to one of the avenues which led from the sea garden out\r\ninto the broad ocean, and here two swordfishes were standing guard.\r\n\r\n\"Is all quiet?\" Merla asked them.\r\n\r\n\"Just as usual, your Highness,\" replied one of the guards.\r\n\"Mummercubble was sick this morning, and grunted dreadfully; but he's\r\nbetter now and has gone to sleep. King Anko has been stirring around\r\nsome, but is now taking his after-dinner nap. I think it will be\r\nperfectly safe for you to swim out for a while, if you wish.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who's Mummercubble?\" asked Trot, as they passed out into deep water.\r\n\r\n\"He's the sea pig,\" replied Merla. \"I am glad he is asleep, for now we\r\nwon't meet him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you like him?\" inquired Trot.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, he complains so bitterly of everything that he bores us,\" Merla\r\nanswered. \"Mummercubble is never contented or happy for a single\r\nminute.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've seen people like that,\" said Cap'n Bill, with a nod of his head;\r\n\"an' they has a way of upsettin' the happiest folks they meet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Look out!\" suddenly cried the mermaid. \"Look out for your fingers!\r\nHere are the snapping eels.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who? Where?\" asked Trot, anxiously.\r\n\r\nAnd now, they were in the midst of a cluster of wriggling, darting\r\neels which sported all around them in the water with marvelous activity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"Yes, look out for your fingers and your noses!\" said one of the eels,\r\nmaking a dash for Cap'n Bill. At first the sailor was tempted to put\r\nout a hand and push the creature away, but remembering that his fingers\r\nwould thus be exposed he remained quiet, and the eel snapped harmlessly\r\njust before his face, and then darted away.\r\n\r\n\"Stop it!\" said Merla; \"stop it this minute, or I'll report your\r\nimpudence to Aquareine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, who cares?\" shouted the Eels. \"We're not afraid of the mermaids.\"\r\n\r\n\"She'll stiffen you all up again, as she did once before,\" said Merla,\r\n\"if you try to hurt the earth people.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are these earth people?\" asked one. And then they all stopped their\r\nplay and regarded Trot and Cap'n Bill with their little black eyes.\r\n\r\n\"The old polliwog looks something like King Anko,\" said one of them.\r\n\r\n\"I'm not a polliwog!\" answered Cap'n Bill, angrily. \"I'm a re-spec'able\r\nsailorman, an' I'll have you treat me decent or I'll know why.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sailor!\" said another. \"That means to float on the water--not _in_ it.\r\nWhat are you doing down here?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm jes' a-visitin',\" answered Cap'n Bill.\r\n\r\n\"He is the guest of our queen,\" said Merla, \"and so is this little\r\ngirl. If you do not behave nicely to them you will surely be sorry.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, that's all right,\" replied one of the biggest eels, wriggling\r\naround in a circle and then snapping at a companion, which as quickly\r\nsnapped out of his way. \"We know how to be polite to company as well as\r\nthe mermaids. We won't hurt them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come on, fellows; let's go scare old Mummercubble,\" cried another;\r\nand then in a flash, they all darted away and left our friends to\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nTrot was greatly relieved.\r\n\r\n\"I don't like eels,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"They are more mischievous than harmful,\" replied Merla; \"but I do not\r\ncare much for them myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" added Cap'n Bill; \"they ain't respec'ful.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Chap. 7._\r\n\r\n_The_ ARISTOCRATIC CODFISH]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe three swam slowly along, quite enjoying the cool depths of the\r\nwater. Every little while they met with some strange creature--or one\r\nthat seemed strange to the earth people--for although Trot and Cap'n\r\nBill had seen many kinds of fish, after they had been caught and\r\npulled from the water, that was very different from meeting them in\r\ntheir own element, \"face to face,\" as Trot expressed it. Now that the\r\nvarious fishes were swimming around free and unafraid in their deep-sea\r\nhome, they were quite different from the gasping, excited creatures\r\nstruggling at the end of a fishline, or flopping from a net.\r\n\r\nBefore long they came upon a group of large fishes lying lazily near\r\nthe bottom of the sea. They were a dark color upon their backs and\r\nsilver underneath, but not especially pretty to look at. The fishes\r\nmade no effort to get out of Merla's way and remained motionless,\r\nexcept for the gentle motion of their fins and gills.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"Here,\" said the mermaid, pausing, \"is the most aristocratic family of\r\nfish in all the sea.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are they?\" asked the girl.\r\n\r\n\"Codfish,\" was the reply. \"Their only fault is that they are too\r\nhaughty and foolishly proud of their pedigree.\"\r\n\r\nOverhearing this speech one codfish said to another, in a very\r\ndignified tone of voice: \"What insolence!\"\r\n\r\n\"Isn't it?\" replied the other. \"There ought to be a law to prevent\r\nthese common mermaids from discussing their superiors.\"\r\n\r\n\"My sakes!\" said Trot, astonished; \"how stuck up they are, aren't they?\"\r\n\r\nFor a moment the group of fishes stared at her solemnly. Then one of\r\nthem remarked in a disdainful manner:\r\n\r\n\"Come, my dears, let us leave these vulgar creatures.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not as vulgar as you are!\" exclaimed Trot, much offended by this\r\nspeech. \"Where I came from we only eat codfish when there's nothing\r\nelse in the house to eat.\"\r\n\r\n\"How absurd!\" observed one of the creatures, arrogantly.\r\n\r\n\"Eat codfish, indeed!\" said another in a lofty manner.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and you're pretty salty, too, I can tell you. At home you're\r\nnothing but a pick-up!\" said Trot.\r\n\r\n\"Dear me!\" exclaimed the first fish which had spoken; \"must we stand\r\nthis insulting language--and from a person to whom we have never been\r\nintroduced?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't need any interduction,\" replied the girl; \"I've eaten you, and\r\nyou always make me thirsty.\"\r\n\r\nMerla laughed merrily at this, and the codfish said, with much dignity:\r\n\r\n\"Come, fellow aristocrats; let us go.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind; we're going ourselves,\" announced Merla, and followed by\r\nher guests the pretty mermaid swam away.\r\n\r\n\"I've heard tell of codfish aristocercy,\" said Cap'n Bill; \"but I never\r\nknowed 'zac'ly what it meant afore.\"\r\n\r\n\"They jus' made me mad, with all their airs,\" observed Trot; \"so I gave\r\n'em a piece of my mind.\"\r\n\r\n\"You surely did, mate,\" said the sailor; \"but I ain't sure they\r\nunderstand what they're like when they're salted an' hung up in the\r\npantry. Folks gener'ly gets stuck-up 'cause they don't know theirselves\r\nlike other folks knows 'em.\"\r\n\r\n\"We are near Crabville now,\" declared Merla. \"Shall we visit the crabs\r\nand see what they are doing?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, let's,\" replied Trot. \"The crabs are lots of fun. I've often\r\ncaught them among the rocks on the shore and laughed at the way they\r\nact. Wasn't it funny at dinner time to see the way they slid around\r\nwith the plates?\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"Those were not crabs, but lobsters and crawfish,\" remarked the\r\nmermaid. \"They are very intelligent creatures, and by making them\r\nserve us we save ourselves much household work. Of course, they are\r\nawkward and provoke us sometimes; but no servants are perfect, it is\r\nsaid, so we get along with ours as well as we can.\"\r\n\r\n\"They're all right,\" protested the child, \"even if they did tip things\r\nover once in a while. But it is easy to work in a sea palace, I'm sure,\r\nbecause there's no dusting or sweeping to be done.\"\r\n\r\n\"Or scrubbin',\" added Cap'n Bill.\r\n\r\n\"The crabs,\" said Merla, \"are second cousins to the lobsters, although\r\nmuch smaller in size. There are many families--or varieties--of\r\ncrabs, and so many of them live in one place near here that we call\r\nit Crabville. I think you will enjoy seeing these little creatures in\r\ntheir native haunts.\"\r\n\r\nThey now approached a kelp bed, the straight, thin stems of the kelp\r\nrunning far upward to the surface of the water. Here and there upon the\r\nstalks were leaves, but Trot thought the growing kelp looked much like\r\nsticks of macaroni, except they were a rich, red-brown color.\r\n\r\nIt was beyond the kelp--which they had to push aside as they swam\r\nthrough it, so thickly did it grow--that they came to a higher level,\r\na sort of plateau on the ocean's bottom. It was covered with scattered\r\nrocks of all sizes, which appeared to have broken off from big shelving\r\nrocks they observed near by. The place they entered seemed like one of\r\nthe rocky canyons you often see upon the earth.\r\n\r\n\"Here live the fiddler crabs,\" said Merla; \"but we must have taken them\r\nby surprise, it is so quiet.\"\r\n\r\nEven as she spoke there was a stirring and scrambling among the rocks,\r\nand soon scores of light green crabs were gathered before the visitors.\r\nThe crabs bore fiddles of all sorts and shapes in their claws, and one\r\nbig fellow carried a leader's baton. The latter crab climbed upon a\r\nflat rock and in an excited voice called out:\r\n\r\n\"Ready, now--ready, good fiddlers. We'll play Number 19--Hail to the\r\nMermaids. Ready! Take aim! Fire away!\"\r\n\r\nAt this command every crab began scraping at his fiddle as hard as he\r\ncould, and the sounds were so shrill and unmusical that Trot wondered\r\nwhen they would begin to play a tune. But they never did; it was one\r\nregular mix-up of sounds from beginning to end. When the noise finally\r\nstopped the leader turned to his visitors and, waving his baton toward\r\nthem, asked:\r\n\r\n\"Well, what do you think of that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not much,\" said Trot, honestly. \"What's it all about?\"\r\n\r\n\"I composed it myself!\" said the Fiddler Crab. \"But it's highly\r\nclassical, I admit. All really great music is an acquired taste.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't like it,\" remarked Cap'n Bill. \"It might do all right to stir\r\nup a racket New Year's Eve, but to call that screechin' music--\"\r\n\r\nJust then the crabs started fiddling again, harder than ever, and as\r\nit promised to be a long performance they left the little creatures\r\nscraping away at their fiddles, as if for dear life, and swam along\r\nthe rocky canyon until, on turning a corner, they came upon a new and\r\ndifferent scene.\r\n\r\nThere were crabs here, too--many of them--and they were performing\r\nthe queerest antics imaginable. Some were building themselves into a\r\npyramid, each standing on edge, with the biggest and strongest ones\r\nat the bottom. When the crabs were five or six rows high they would\r\nall tumble over, still clinging to one another, and, having reached\r\nthe ground, they would separate and commence to build the pyramid over\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nOthers were chasing one another around in a circle, always moving\r\nbackward or sidewise, and trying to play \"leapfrog\" as they went. Still\r\nothers were swinging on slight branches of seaweed, or turning cart\r\nwheels, or indulging in similar antics.\r\n\r\nMerla and the earth people watched the busy little creatures for some\r\ntime before they were themselves observed; but finally, Trot gave a\r\nlaugh when one crab fell on its back and began frantically waving its\r\nlegs to get right-side-up again. At the sound of her laughter they\r\nall stopped their play and came toward the visitors in a flock, looking\r\nup at them with their bright eyes in a most comical way.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"Welcome home!\" cried one, as he turned a back somersault and knocked\r\nanother crab over.\r\n\r\n\"What's the difference between a mermaid and a tadpole?\" asked another,\r\nin a loud voice, and without a pause continued: \"why, one drops its\r\ntail and the other holds on to it. Ha, ha! Ho, ho! Hee-hee!\"\r\n\r\n\"These,\" said Merla, \"are the clown crabs. They are very silly things,\r\nas you may already have discovered; but for a short time they are\r\nrather amusing. One tires of them very soon.\"\r\n\r\n\"They're funny,\" said Trot, laughing again. \"It's almost as good as a\r\ncircus. I don't think they would make me tired; but, then, I'm not a\r\nmermaid.\"\r\n\r\nThe clown crabs had now formed a row in front of them.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Johnsing,\" asked one, \"why is a mermaid like an automobile?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know, Tommy Blimken,\" answered a big crab in the middle of the\r\nrow. \"_Why_ do you think a mermaid is like an automobile?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because they both get tired,\" said Tommy Blimken. Then all the crabs\r\nlaughed, and Tommy seemed to laugh louder than the rest.\r\n\r\n\"How do the crabs in the sea know anything 'bout auto'biles?\" asked\r\nTrot.\r\n\r\n\"Why, Tommy Blimken and Harry Hustle were both captured once by humans\r\nand put in an aquarium,\" answered the mermaid. \"But one day they\r\nclimbed out and escaped, finally making their way back to the sea and\r\nhome again. So they are quite traveled you see, and great favorites\r\namong the crabs. While they were on land they saw a great many curious\r\nthings, and so I suppose they saw automobiles.\"\r\n\r\n\"We did, we did!\" cried Harry Hustle, an awkward crab with one big\r\nclaw and one little one. \"And we saw earth people with legs--awfully\r\nfunny they were; and animals called horses, with legs; and other\r\ncreatures with legs; and the people cover themselves with the queerest\r\nthings--they even wear feathers and flowers on their heads, and----\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, we know all about that,\" said Trot; \"we live on the earth\r\nourselves.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you're lucky to get off from it and into the good water,\" said\r\nthe Crab. \"I nearly died on the earth; it was so stupid, dry and airy.\r\nBut the circus was great. They held the performance right in front of\r\nthe aquarium where we lived, and Tommy and I learned all the tricks of\r\nthe tumblers. Hi! Come on, fellows, and show the earth people what you\r\ncan do!\"\r\n\r\nAt this the crabs began performing their antics again; but they did\r\nthe same things over and over, so Cap'n Bill and Trot soon tired, as\r\nMerla said they would, and decided they had seen enough of the crab\r\ncircus. So they proceeded to swim farther up the rocky canyon, and near\r\nits upper end they came to a lot of conch shells lying upon the sandy\r\nbottom. A funny looking crab was sticking his head out from each of\r\nthese shells.\r\n\r\n\"Here are the hermit crabs,\" said one of the mermaids. \"They steal\r\nthese shells and live in them, so no enemies can attack them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't they get lonesome?\" asked Trot.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps so, my dear. But they do not seem to mind being lonesome. They\r\nare great cowards, and think if they can but protect their lives there\r\nis nothing else to care for. Unlike the jolly crabs we have just left,\r\nthe hermits are cross and unsociable.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, keep quiet and go away!\" said one of the hermit crabs, in a grumpy\r\nvoice. \"No one wants mermaids around here.\" Then every crab withdrew\r\nits head into its shell, and our friends saw them no more.\r\n\r\n\"They're not very polite,\" observed Trot, following the mermaid as\r\nMerla swam upward into the middle water.\r\n\r\n\"I know, now, why cross people are called 'crabbed',\" said Cap'n Bill.\r\n\"They've got dispositions jes' like these 'ere hermit crabs.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nPresently, they came upon a small flock of mackerel, and noticed that\r\nthe fishes seemed much excited. When they saw the mermaid they cried\r\nout:\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Merla! what do you think? Our Flippity has just gone to glory!\"\r\n\r\n\"When?\" asked the mermaid.\r\n\r\n\"Just now,\" one replied. \"We were lying in the water, talking quietly\r\ntogether when a spinning, shining thing came along and our dear\r\nFlippity ate it. Then he went shooting up to the top of the water and\r\ngave a flop and--went to glory! Isn't it splendid, Merla?\"\r\n\r\n\"Poor Flippity!\" sighed the mermaid. \"I'm sorry, for he was the\r\nprettiest and nicest mackerel in your whole flock.\"\r\n\r\n\"What does it mean?\" asked Trot. \"How did Flippity go to glory?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, he was caught by a hook, and pulled out of the water into some\r\nboat,\" Merla explained. \"But these poor, stupid creatures do not\r\nunderstand that; and when one of them is jerked out of the water and\r\ndisappears they have an idea he has gone to glory--which means to them\r\nsome unknown, but beautiful sea.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've often wondered,\" said Trot, \"why fishes are foolish enough to\r\nbite on hooks.\"\r\n\r\n\"They must know enough to know they're hooks,\" added Cap'n Bill,\r\nmusingly.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, they do,\" replied Merla. \"I've seen fishes gather around a hook\r\nand look at it carefully for a long time. They well know it is a hook,\r\nand that if they bite the bait upon it they will be pulled out of the\r\nwater. But they are curious to know what will happen to them afterward,\r\nand think it means happiness, instead of death. So finally, one takes\r\nthe hook and disappears, and the others never know what becomes of him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why don't you tell 'em the truth?\" asked Trot.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, we do. The mermaids have warned them many times, but it does no\r\ngood at all. The fish are stupid creatures.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I wish I was Flippity,\" said one of the mackerel, staring at Trot\r\nwith his big, round eyes. \"He went to glory before I could eat the hook\r\nmyself.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're lucky,\" answered the child. \"Flippity will be fried in a pan\r\nfor some one's dinner. You wouldn't like that, would you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Flippity has gone to glory!\" said another, and then they swam away in\r\nhaste to tell the news to all they met.\r\n\r\n\"I never heard of anything so foolish,\" remarked Trot, as they swam\r\nslowly on through the clear blue water.\r\n\r\n\"Yes; it is very foolish, and very sad,\" answered Merla. \"But, if the\r\nfishes were wise, men could not catch them for food, and many poor\r\npeople on your earth make their living by fishing.\"\r\n\r\n\"It seems wicked to catch such pretty things,\" said the child.\r\n\r\n\"I do not think so,\" Merla replied, laughingly; \"for they were born\r\nto become food for some one, and men are not the only ones that eat\r\nfishes. Many creatures of the sea feed upon them. They even eat one\r\nanother, at times. And if none was ever destroyed they would soon\r\nbecome so numerous that they would clog the waters of the ocean, and\r\nleave no room for the rest of us. So, after all, perhaps it is just as\r\nwell they are thoughtless and foolish.\"\r\n\r\nPresently they came to some round balls that looked much like balloons\r\nin shape and were gaily colored. They floated quietly in the water, and\r\nTrot inquired what they were.\r\n\r\n\"Balloonfish,\" answered Merla. \"They are helpless creatures, but have\r\nlittle spikes all over them, so their enemies dare not bite them for\r\nfear of getting pricked.\"\r\n\r\nTrot found the balloonfish quite interesting. They had little dots of\r\neyes and dots for mouths; but she could see no noses, and their fins\r\nand tails were very small.\r\n\r\n\"They catch these fish in the South Sea Islands and make lanterns of\r\n'em,\" said Cap'n Bill. \"They first skin 'em, and sew the skin up again\r\nto let it dry, and then they put candles inside and the light shines\r\nthrough the dried skin.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FLIPPITY'S GONE TO GLORY]\r\n\r\nMany other curious sights they saw in the ocean that afternoon, and\r\nboth Cap'n Bill and Trot thoroughly enjoyed their glimpse of sea life.\r\nAt last Merla said it was time to return to the palace, from which she\r\nclaimed they had not, at any time, been very far distant.\r\n\r\n\"We must prepare for dinner, as it will soon begin to grow dark in the\r\nwater,\" continued their conductor. So they swam leisurely back to the\r\ngroves that surrounded the palaces, and as they entered the gardens the\r\nsun sank, and deep shadows began to form in the ocean depths.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Chap. 8._\r\n\r\nA BANQUET UNDER WATER]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe palaces of the mermaids were all aglow with lights as they\r\napproached them, and Trot was amazed at the sight.\r\n\r\n\"Where did the lamps come from?\" she asked their guide, wonderingly.\r\n\r\n\"They are not lamps, my dear,\" replied Merla, much amused at this\r\nsuggestion; \"we use electric lights in our palaces, and have done so\r\nfor thousands of years--long before the earth people knew of electric\r\nlights.\"\r\n\r\n\"But where do you get 'em?\" inquired Cap'n Bill, who was as much\r\nastonished as the girl.\r\n\r\n\"From a transparent jellyfish which naturally emits a strong and\r\nbeautiful electric light,\" was the answer. \"We have many hundreds of\r\nthem in our palaces, as you will presently see.\"\r\n\r\nTheir way was now lighted by small phosphorescent creatures scattered\r\nabout the sea gardens and which Merla informed them were hyalæa, or\r\nsea glowworms. But their light was dim when compared to that of the\r\nelectric jellyfish, which they found placed in clusters upon the\r\nceilings of all the rooms of the palaces, rendering them light as day.\r\n\r\nTrot watched these curious creatures with delight, for delicately\r\ncolored lights ran around their bodies in every direction in a\r\ncontinuous stream, shedding splendid rays throughout the vast halls.\r\n\r\nA group of mermaids met the visitors in the hall of the main palace,\r\nand told Merla the queen had instructed them to show the guests to\r\ntheir rooms as soon as they arrived. So Trot followed two of them\r\nthrough several passages, after which they swam upward and entered a\r\ncircular opening. There were no stairs here, because there was no need\r\nof them, and the little girl soon found herself in an upper room that\r\nwas very beautiful indeed.\r\n\r\nAll the walls were covered with iridescent shells, polished till they\r\nresembled mother-of-pearl, and upon the glass ceiling were clusters\r\nof the brilliant electric jellyfish, rendering the room bright and\r\ncheerful with their radiance. In one corner stood a couch of white\r\ncoral, with gossamer draperies floating around it from the four high\r\nposts. Upon examining it, the child found the couch was covered with\r\nsoft, amber sponges, which rendered it very comfortable to lie upon.\r\nIn a wardrobe she found several beautiful gossamer gowns, richly\r\nembroidered in colored seaweeds, and these Mayre was told she might\r\nwear while she remained the guest of the mermaids. She also found a\r\ntoilet table with brushes, combs and other conveniences, all of which\r\nwere made of polished tortoise-shell.\r\n\r\nReally, the room was more dainty and comfortable than one might suppose\r\npossible in a palace far beneath the surface of the sea, and Trot was\r\ngreatly delighted with her new quarters.\r\n\r\nThe mermaid attendants assisted the child to dress herself in one\r\nof the prettiest robes, which she found to be quite dry and fitted\r\nperfectly. Then the sea-maids brushed and dressed her hair, and tied it\r\nwith ribbons of cherry-red seaweed. Finally they placed around her neck\r\na string of pearls that would have been priceless upon the earth, and\r\nnow the little girl announced she was ready for supper and had a good\r\nappetite.\r\n\r\nCap'n Bill had been given a similar room, near Trot's; but the old\r\nsailor refused to change his clothes for any others offered him, for\r\nwhich reason he was ready for supper long before his comrade.\r\n\r\n\"What bothers me, mate,\" he said to the little girl, as they swam\r\ntoward the great banquet hall where Queen Aquareine awaited them, \"is\r\nwhy we ain't crushed by the pressin' of the water agin us, bein' as\r\nwe're down here in the deep sea.\"\r\n\r\n\"How's that, Cap'n? Why should we be crushed?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"Why, ev'r'body knows that the deeper you go in the sea the more the\r\nwater presses agin you,\" he explained. \"Even the divers in their steel\r\njackets can't stand it very deep down. An' here we be, miles from the\r\ntop o' the water, I 'spect, an' we don't feel crowded a bit.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know why,\" answered the child, wisely. \"The water don't touch us,\r\nyou see. If it did, it might crush us; but it don't. It's always held a\r\nlittle way off from our bodies by the magic of the fairy mermaids.\"\r\n\r\n\"True enough, Trot,\" declared the sailorman. \"What an idjut I was not\r\nto think o' that myself!\"\r\n\r\nIn the royal banquet hall were assembled many of the mermaids, headed\r\nby the lovely queen, and as soon as their earth guests arrived\r\nAquareine ordered the meal to be served.\r\n\r\nThe lobsters again waited upon the table, wearing little white caps and\r\naprons which made them look very funny; but Trot was so hungry after\r\nher afternoon's excursion that she did not pay as much attention to\r\nthe lobsters as she did to her supper, which was very delicious and\r\nconsisted of many courses. A lobster spilled some soup on Cap'n Bill's\r\nbald head and made him yell for a minute, because it was hot and he\r\nhad not expected it, but the queen apologized very sweetly for the\r\nawkwardness of her servants, and the sailor soon forgot all about the\r\nincident in his enjoyment of the meal.\r\n\r\nAfter the feast ended they all went to the big reception room, where\r\nsome of the mermaids played upon harps while others sang pretty songs.\r\nThey danced together, too--a graceful swimming-dance, so queer to the\r\nlittle girl that it interested and amused her greatly.\r\n\r\nCap'n Bill seemed a bit bashful among so many beautiful mermaids, yet\r\nhe was pleased when the queen offered him a place beside her throne,\r\nwhere he could see and hear all the delightful entertainment provided\r\nfor the royal guests. He did not talk much, being a man of few words\r\nexcept when alone with Trot; but his light blue eyes were big and round\r\nwith wonder at the sights he saw.\r\n\r\nTrot and the sailorman went to bed early and slept soundly upon their\r\nsponge-covered couches. The little girl never wakened until long after\r\nthe sun was shining down through the glass roof of her room, and when\r\nshe opened her eyes she was startled to find a number of big, small and\r\nmiddle-sized fishes staring at her through the glass.\r\n\r\n\"That's one bad thing 'bout this mermaid palace,\" she said to herself;\r\n\"it's too public. Ever'thing in the sea can look at you through the\r\nglass as much as it likes. I wouldn't mind fishes looking at me if they\r\nhadn't such big eyes, an'--goodness me! There's a monster that's all\r\nhead! And there goes a fish with a sail on its back; an' here's old\r\nMummercubble, I'm sure, for he's got a head just like a pig.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nShe might have watched the fishes on the roof for hours, had she not\r\nremembered it was late and breakfast must be ready. So she dressed, and\r\nmade her toilet, and swam down into the palace to find Cap'n Bill and\r\nthe mermaids politely waiting for her to join them.\r\n\r\nThe sea maidens were as fresh and lovely as ever, while each and all\r\nproved sweet tempered and merry, even at the breakfast table--and that\r\nis where people are cross, if they ever are. During the meal the queen\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"I shall take you this morning to the most interesting part of the\r\nocean, where the largest and most remarkable sea creatures live. And\r\nwe must visit King Anko, too, for the sea serpent would feel hurt and\r\nslighted if I did not bring my guests to call upon him.\"\r\n\r\n\"That will be nice,\" said Trot, eagerly; but Cap'n Bill asked:\r\n\r\n\"Is there any danger, ma'am?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think not,\" replied Queen Aquareine. \"I cannot see that you will\r\nbe exposed to any danger at all, so long as I am with you. But we are\r\ngoing into the neighborhood of some fierce and even terrible beings,\r\nwhich would attack you at once did they suspect you to be earth people.\r\nSo, in order to guard your safety, I intend to draw the Magic Circle\r\naround both of you before we start.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is the Magic Circle?\" asked Trot.\r\n\r\n\"A fairy charm that prevents any enemy from touching you. No monster of\r\nthe sea, however powerful, will be able to reach your body while you\r\nare protected by the Magic Circle,\" declared the Queen.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, then, I'll not be a bit afraid,\" returned the child, with perfect\r\nconfidence.\r\n\r\n\"Am I to have the Magic Circle drawn around me, too?\" asked Cap'n Bill.\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" answered Aquareine. \"You will need no other protection\r\nthan that, yet Princess Clia and I will both be with you. For to-day I\r\nshall leave Merla to rule our palaces in my place until we return.\"\r\n\r\nNo sooner was breakfast finished than Trot was anxious to start. The\r\ngirl was also curious to discover what the powerful Magic Circle might\r\nprove to be, but she was a little disappointed in the ceremony. The\r\nqueen merely grasped her fairy wand in her right hand and swam around\r\nthe child in a circle, from left to right. Then she took her wand in\r\nher left hand and swam around Trot in another circle, from right to\r\nleft.\r\n\r\n\"Now, my dear,\" said she, \"you are safe from any creature we are liable\r\nto meet.\"\r\n\r\nShe performed the same ceremony for Cap'n Bill, who was doubtful about\r\nthe Magic Circle, because he felt the same after it as he had before.\r\nBut he said nothing of his unbelief, and soon they left the palace and\r\nstarted upon their journey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Chap. 9._\r\n\r\nTHE BASHFUL OCTOPUS]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a lovely day, and the sea was like azure under the rays of the\r\nsun.\r\n\r\nOver the flower beds and through the gardens they swam, emerging into\r\nthe open sea in a direction opposite that taken by the visitors the\r\nday before. The party consisted of but four: Queen Aquareine, Princess\r\nClia, Trot and Cap'n Bill.\r\n\r\n\"People who live upon the land know only those sea creatures which\r\nthey are able to catch in nets, or upon hooks, or those which become\r\ndisabled and are washed ashore,\" remarked the Queen, as they swam\r\nswiftly through the clear water. \"And those who sail in ships see only\r\nthe creatures who chance to come to the surface. But, in the deep ocean\r\ncaverns are queer beings, that no mortal has ever heard of or beheld,\r\nand some of these we are to visit. We shall also see some sea shrubs\r\nand flowering weeds, which are sure to delight you with their beauty.\"\r\n\r\nThe sights really began before they had gone very far from the palace,\r\nand a school of butterfly fish, having gorgeous colors spattered over\r\ntheir broad wings, was first to delight the strangers. They swam just\r\nas butterflies fly, with a darting, jerky motion, and called a merry\r\n\"Good morning!\" to the mermaids as they passed.\r\n\r\n\"These butterfly fish are remarkably active,\" said the Princess, \"and\r\ntheir quick motions protect them from their enemies. We like to meet\r\nthem; they are always so gay and good-natured.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, so am I!\" cried a sharp voice just beside them, and they all\r\npaused to discover what creature had spoken to them.\r\n\r\n\"Take care,\" said Clia, in a low voice. \"It's an octopus.\"\r\n\r\nTrot looked eagerly around. A long, brown arm stretched across their\r\nway in front, and another just behind them; but that did not worry her.\r\nThe octopus, himself, came slowly sliding up to them, and proved to be\r\nwell worth looking at.\r\n\r\nHe wore a red coat with brass buttons, and a silk hat was tipped over\r\none ear. His eyes were somewhat dull and watery and he had a moustache\r\nof long, hair-like \"feelers\" that curled stiffly at the ends. When he\r\ntried to smile at them he showed two rows of sharp, white teeth. In\r\nspite of his red coat and yellow embroidered vest, his standing collar\r\nand carefully tied cravat, the legs of the octopus were bare, and Trot\r\nnoticed he used some of his legs for arms, as in one of them was held a\r\nslender cane, and in another, a handkerchief.\r\n\r\n\"Well, well!\" said the Octopus. \"Are you all dumb? Or don't you know\r\nenough to be civil when you meet a neighbor?\"\r\n\r\n\"We know how to be civil to our friends,\" replied Trot, who did not\r\nlike the way he spoke.\r\n\r\n\"Well, aren't we friends, then?\" asked the Octopus, in an airy tone of\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n\"I think not,\" said the little girl. \"Octopuses are horrid creatures.\"\r\n\r\n\"Octo_pi_, if you please; octo_pi_\" said the monster, with a laugh.\r\n\r\n\"I don't see any pie that pleases me,\" replied Trot, beginning to get\r\nangry.\r\n\r\n\"Octo_pus_ means one of us; two, or more are called octo_pi_,\" remarked\r\nthe creature, as if correcting her speech.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose a lot of you would be a whole bakery!\" she said, scornfully.\r\n\r\n\"Our name is latin. It was given us by learned scientists years ago,\"\r\nsaid the Octopus.\r\n\r\n\"That's true enough,\" agreed Cap'n Bill. \"The learned scientists named\r\nev'ry blamed thing they come acrost, an' gener'ly they picked out\r\nnames as nobody could understand, or pernounce.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"That isn't our fault, sir,\" said the Octopus. \"Indeed, it's pretty\r\nhard for us to go through life with such terrible names. Think of the\r\npoor little sea horse. He used to be a merry and cheerful fellow, but\r\nsince they named him 'hippocampus' he hasn't smiled once.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let's go,\" said Trot; \"I don't like to 'sociate with octopuses.\"\r\n\r\n\"Octo_pi_,\" said the creature, again correcting her.\r\n\r\n\"You're jus' as horrid, whether you're puses or pies,\" she declared.\r\n\r\n\"Horrid!\" cried the monster, in a shocked tone of voice.\r\n\r\n\"Not only horrid, but horrible!\" persisted the girl.\r\n\r\n\"May I ask in what way?\" he inquired, and it was easy to see he was\r\noffended.\r\n\r\n\"Why, ev'rybody knows that octopuses are jus' wicked an' deceitful,\"\r\nshe said. \"Up on the earth, where I live, they call the Stannerd Oil\r\nCompany an octopus, an' the Coal Trust an octopus, an'----\"\r\n\r\n\"Stop, stop!\" cried the monster, in a pleading voice. \"Do you mean to\r\ntell me that the earth people, whom I have always respected, compare me\r\nto the Stannerd Oil Company?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Trot, positively.\r\n\r\n\"That's what they do,\" added Cap'n Bill, nodding his grizzled head.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, what a disgrace! What a deep, direful, dreadful disgrace!\" moaned\r\nthe Octopus, drooping his head in shame; and Trot could see great tears\r\nrolling down his cheeks.\r\n\r\n\"This comes of having a bad name,\" said the Queen, gently, for she was\r\nmoved by the monster's grief.\r\n\r\n\"It is unjust! It is cruel and unjust!\" sobbed the creature,\r\nmournfully. \"Just because we have several long arms, and take whatever\r\nwe can reach, they accuse us of being like--like--oh, I cannot say it!\r\nIt is too shameful--too humiliating!\"\r\n\r\n\"Come; let's go,\" said Trot, again; so they left the poor octopus\r\nweeping and wiping his watery eyes with his handkerchief, and swam on\r\ntheir way.\r\n\r\n\"I'm not a bit sorry for him,\" remarked the child; \"for his legs remind\r\nme of serpents.\"\r\n\r\n\"So they do me,\" agreed Cap'n Bill.\r\n\r\n\"But the octopi are not very bad,\" said the Princess, \"and we get along\r\nwith them much better than we do with their cousins the sea devils.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh. Are the sea devils their cousins?\" asked Trot.\r\n\r\n\"Yes; and they are the only creatures of the ocean which we greatly\r\nfear,\" replied Aquareine. \"I hope we shall meet none to-day, for we are\r\ngoing near to the dismal caverns where they live.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are the sea devils like, ma'am?\" inquired Cap'n Bill, a little\r\nuneasily.\r\n\r\n\"Something like the octopus you just saw, only much larger and of a\r\nbright scarlet color, striped with black,\" answered the Queen. \"They\r\nare very fierce and terrible creatures, and nearly as much dreaded by\r\nthe inhabitants of the ocean as is Zog, and nearly as powerful as King\r\nAnko himself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Zog! Who is Zog?\" questioned the girl. \"I haven't heard of him, before\r\nnow.\"\r\n\r\n\"We do not like to mention Zog's name,\" responded the Queen, in a low\r\nvoice. \"He is the wicked genius of the sea, and a magician of great\r\npower.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's he like?\" asked Cap'n Bill.\r\n\r\n\"He is a dreadful creature, part fish, part man, part beast and part\r\nserpent. Centuries ago they cast him off the earth into the sea, where\r\nhe has caused much trouble. Once he waged a terrible war against King\r\nAnko, but the sea serpent finally conquered Zog, and drove the magician\r\ninto his castle, where he now stays shut up. For if ever Anko catches\r\nthe monster outside of his enchanted castle he will kill him, and Zog\r\nknows that very well.\"\r\n\r\n\"Seems like you have your troubles down here, just as we do on top the\r\nground,\" remarked Cap'n Bill.\r\n\r\n\"But, I'm glad old Zog is shut up in his castle,\" added Trot. \"Is it a\r\nsea castle, like your own palaces?\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot say, my dear, for the enchantment makes it invisible to all\r\neyes but those of its inhabitants,\" replied Aquareine. \"No one sees Zog\r\nnow, and we scarcely ever hear of him; but all the sea people know he\r\nis here, some place, and fear his power. Even in the old days, before\r\nAnko conquered him, Zog was the enemy of the mermaids, as he was of all\r\nthe good and respectable seafolk. But do not worry about the magician,\r\nI beg of you, for he has not dared to do an evil deed in many, many\r\nyears.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I'm not afraid,\" asserted Trot.\r\n\r\n\"I'm glad of that,\" said the Queen. \"Keep together, friends, and be\r\ncareful not to separate, for here comes an army of sawfishes.\"\r\n\r\nEven as Aquareine spoke they saw a swirl and commotion in the water\r\nahead of them, while a sound like a muffled roar fell upon their ears.\r\nThen swiftly there dashed upon them a group of great fishes, with long\r\nsaws sticking out in front of their noses, armed with sharp hooked\r\nteeth, all set in a row. They were larger than the swordfishes and\r\nseemed more fierce and bold. But the mermaids and Trot, and Cap'n Bill\r\nquietly awaited their attack, and instead of tearing them with their\r\nsaws, as they expected to do, the fishes were unable to touch them at\r\nall. They tried every possible way to get at their proposed victims,\r\nbut the Magic Circle was all-powerful and turned aside the ugly saws;\r\nso our friends were not disturbed at all. Seeing this, the sawfishes\r\nsoon abandoned the attempt and with growls and roars of disappointment\r\nswam away and were quickly out of sight.\r\n\r\nTrot had been a wee bit frightened during the attack, but now she\r\nlaughed gleefully and told the queen that it seemed very nice to be\r\nprotected by fairy powers.\r\n\r\nThe water grew a darker blue as they descended into its depths,\r\nfarther and farther away from the rays of the sun. Trot was surprised\r\nto find she could see so plainly through the high wall of water above\r\nher; but the sun was able to shoot its beams straight down through the\r\ntransparent sea, and they seemed to penetrate to every nook and crevice\r\nof the rocky bottom.\r\n\r\nIn this deeper part of the ocean some of the fishes had a\r\nphosphorescent light of their own, and these could be seen far ahead,\r\nas if they were lanterns. The explorers met a school of argonauts going\r\nup to the surface for a sail, and the child watched these strange\r\ncreatures with much curiosity. The argonauts live in shells, in which\r\nthey are able to hide in case of danger from prowling wolf fishes; but\r\notherwise they crawl out and carry their shells like humps upon their\r\nbacks. Then they spread their skinny sails above them and sail away\r\nunder water till they come to the surface, where they float and let the\r\ncurrents of air carry them along the same as the currents of water had\r\ndone before. Trot thought the argonauts comical little creatures, with\r\ntheir big eyes and sharp noses, and to her they looked like a fleet of\r\ntiny ships.\r\n\r\nIt is said that men got their first idea of boats, and of how to sail\r\nthem, from watching these little argonauts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Chap. 10._\r\n\r\nTHE UNDISCOVERED ISLAND]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn following the fleet of argonauts the four explorers had risen higher\r\nin the water and soon found they had wandered to an open space that\r\nseemed to Trot like the flat top of a high hill. The sands were covered\r\nwith a growth of weeds so gorgeously colored that one who had never\r\npeered beneath the surface of the sea would scarcely believe they were\r\nnot the product of a dye shop. Every known hue seemed represented in\r\nthe delicate fern-like leaves that swayed softly to and fro as the\r\ncurrent moved them. They were not set close together, these branches of\r\nmagnificent hues, but were scattered sparsely over the sandy bottom of\r\nthe sea, so that while from a distance they seemed thick, a nearer view\r\nfound them spread out with ample spaces of sand between them.\r\n\r\nIn these sandy spaces lay the real attractiveness of the place, for\r\nhere were many of those wonders of the deep that have surprised and\r\ninterested people in all ages.\r\n\r\nFirst were the starfishes--hundreds of them, it seemed--lying sleepily\r\non the bottom, with their five or six points extended outward. They\r\nwere of various colors, some rich and brilliant, others of dark brown\r\nhues. A few had wound their arms around the weeds, or were creeping\r\nslowly from one place to another, in the latter case turning their\r\npoints downward and using them as legs. But most of them were lying\r\nmotionless, and as Trot looked down upon them she thought they\r\nresembled stars in the sky on a bright night--except that the blue of\r\nthe heavens was here replaced by the white sand, and the twinkling\r\ndiamond stars by the colored starfish.\r\n\r\n\"We are near an island,\" said the Queen, \"and that is why so many\r\nstarfishes are here, as they love to keep close to shore. Also the\r\nlittle sea horses love these weeds and to me they are more interesting\r\nthan the starfish.\"\r\n\r\nTrot now noticed the sea horses for the first time. They were quite\r\nsmall--merely two or three inches high--but had funny little heads that\r\nwere shaped much like the head of a horse, and bright, intelligent\r\neyes. They had no legs, though, for their bodies ended in tails which\r\nthey twined around the stems of seaweeds to support themselves, and\r\nkeep the currents from carrying them away.\r\n\r\nTrot bent down close to examine one of the queer little creatures, and\r\nexclaimed: \"Why, the sea horses haven't any fins, or anything to swim\r\nwith.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes we have,\" replied the Sea Horse, in a tiny, but distinct\r\nvoice. \"These things on the side of my head are fins.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought they were ears,\" said the girl.\r\n\r\n\"So they are. Fins and ears at the same time,\" answered the little sea\r\nanimal. \"Also, there are small fins on our backs. Of course, we can't\r\nswim as the mermaids do, or even as swiftly as fishes; but we manage to\r\nget around, thank you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't the fishes catch and eat you?\" inquired Trot, curiously.\r\n\r\n\"Sometimes,\" admitted the Sea Horse, \"and there are many other living\r\nthings that have a way of destroying us. But here I am, as you see,\r\nover six weeks old, and during that time I have escaped every danger.\r\nThat isn't so bad, is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Phoo!\" said a Starfish lying near, \"I'm over three months old. You're\r\na mere baby, Sea Horse.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not!\" cried the Sea Horse, excitedly. \"I'm full-grown, and may\r\nlive to be as old as you are!\"\r\n\r\n\"Not if I keep on living,\" said the Starfish, calmly, and Trot knew he\r\nwas correct in his statement.\r\n\r\nThe little girl now noticed several sea spiders creeping around, and\r\ndrew back because she did not think them very pretty. They were\r\nshaped not unlike the starfishes, but had slender legs and big heads\r\nwith wicked looking eyes sticking out of them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I don't like those things!\" said Trot, coming closer to her\r\ncompanions.\r\n\r\n\"You don't, eh?\" said a big Sea Spider, in a cross voice. \"Why do you\r\ncome around here, then, scaring away my dinner, when you're not wanted?\"\r\n\r\n\"It isn't _your_ ocean,\" replied Trot.\r\n\r\n\"No; and it isn't yours,\" snapped the Spider. \"But as it's big enough\r\nfor us both, I'd like you to go away.\"\r\n\r\n\"So we will,\" said Aquareine, gently, and at once she moved toward the\r\nsurface of the water. Trot and Cap'n Bill followed, with Clia, and the\r\nchild asked:\r\n\r\n\"What island are we near?\"\r\n\r\n\"It has no name,\" answered the Queen, \"for it is not inhabited by man,\r\nnor has it ever yet been discovered by them. Perhaps you will be the\r\nfirst humans to see this island. But it is a barren, rocky place, and\r\nonly fit for seals and turtles.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are any of them there now?\" Cap'n Bill inquired.\r\n\r\n\"I think so. We will see.\"\r\n\r\nTrot was astonished to find how near they were to the \"top\" of the\r\nocean, for they had not ascended through the water very long when\r\nsuddenly her head popped into the air, and she gave a gasp of surprise\r\nto find herself looking at the clear sky for the first time since she\r\nhad started upon this adventure, by rowing into Giant's Cave.\r\n\r\nShe floated comfortably in the water, with her head and face just out\r\nof it, and began to look around her. Cap'n Bill was at her side, and\r\nso were the two mermaids. The day was fair and the surface of the sea,\r\nwhich stretched far away as the eye could reach, rippled under a gentle\r\nbreeze. They had risen almost at the edge of a small, rocky islet, high\r\nin the middle, but gradually slanting down to the water. No trees, or\r\nbushes, or grass grew anywhere about; only rocks, gray and bleak, were\r\nto be seen.\r\n\r\nTrot scarcely noticed this at first, however, for the island seemed\r\ncovered with groups of forms, some still and some moving, which the old\r\nsailor promptly recognized as seals. Many were lying asleep or sunning\r\nthemselves; others crept awkwardly around, using their strong fins as\r\nlegs or \"paddles,\" and caring little if they disturbed the slumbers of\r\nthe others. Once in a while, one of those crowded out of place would\r\ngive a loud and angry bark, which awakened others and set them to\r\nbarking likewise.\r\n\r\nBaby seals were there in great numbers, and were more active and\r\nplayful than their elders. It was really wonderful how they could\r\nscramble around on the land, and Trot laughed more than once at their\r\nantics.\r\n\r\nAt the edge of the water lay many huge turtles, some as big around as a\r\nwagon wheel and others much smaller in size.\r\n\r\n\"The big ones are very old,\" said the Queen, seeing Trot's eyes fixed\r\non the turtles.\r\n\r\n\"How old?\" asked the child.\r\n\r\n\"Hundreds of years, I think. They live to a great age, for nothing can\r\nharm them when they withdraw their legs and heads into their thick\r\nshells. We use some of the turtles for food, but prefer the younger\r\nones. Men also fish for turtles and eat them, but, of course, no men\r\never come to this out-of-the-way place in the ocean, so the inhabitants\r\nof this little island know they are perfectly safe.\"\r\n\r\nIn the center of the island rose high cliffs, on top of which were to\r\nbe seen great flocks of sea-gulls, some whirling in the air, while\r\nothers were perched upon the points of rock.\r\n\r\n\"What do the birds find to eat?\" asked Cap'n Bill.\r\n\r\n\"They often feed upon seals which die of accident or old age, and they\r\nare expert fishermen,\" explained Queen Aquareine. \"Curiously enough,\r\nthe seals also feed upon these birds, which they are often able to\r\ncatch in their strong jaws, when the gulls venture too near. And then,\r\nthe seals frequently rob the nests of eggs, of which they are very\r\nfond.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd like a few gulls' eggs now,\" remarked a big seal that lay near\r\nthem upon the shore. Trot had thought him sound asleep, but now he\r\nopened his eyes to blink lazily at the group in the water.\r\n\r\n\"Good morning,\" said the Queen. \"Aren't you Chief Muffruff?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am,\" answered the old seal. \"And you are Aquareine, the mermaid\r\nqueen. You see I remember you, although you haven't been here for\r\nyears. And isn't that Princess Clia? To be sure! But the other mermaids\r\nare strangers to me; especially the bald-headed one.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not a mermaid,\" asserted Cap'n Bill. \"I'm a sailor, jes'\r\na-visitin' the mermaids.\"\r\n\r\n\"Our friends are earth dwellers,\" explained the Queen.\r\n\r\n\"That's odd,\" said Muffruff. \"I can't remember that any earth dwellers\r\never came this way before. I never travel far, you see, for I'm chief\r\nof this disorderly family of seals that live on this island--on it and\r\noff it, that is.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're a poor chief,\" said a big turtle lying beside the seal. \"If\r\nyour people are disorderly it is your own fault.\"\r\n\r\nMuffruff gave a chuckling laugh. Then, with a movement quick as\r\nlightning, he pushed his head under the shell of the turtle and gave it\r\na sudden jerk. The huge turtle was tossed up on edge and then turned\r\nflat on its back, where its short legs struggled vainly to right its\r\noverturned body.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"There!\" snorted the Seal, contemptuously. \"Perhaps you'll dare\r\ninsult me again in the presence of visitors, you old mud-wallower!\"\r\n\r\nSeeing the plight of the turtle, several young seals came laughingly\r\nwabbling to the spot, and as they approached the helpless creature drew\r\nin his legs and head, and closed his two shells tightly together. The\r\nseals bumped against the turtle and gave it a push that sent it sliding\r\ndown the beach like a toboggan, and a minute later it splashed into the\r\nwater and sank out of sight.\r\n\r\nBut that was just what the creature wanted. On shore the upset turtle\r\nwas quite helpless; but the mischievous seals saved him. For as soon as\r\nhe touched the water he was able to turn and right himself, which he\r\npromptly did. Then he raised his head above the water and asked:\r\n\r\n\"Is it peace, or war, Muffruff?\"\r\n\r\n\"Whichever you like,\" answered the Seal, indifferently.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the turtle was angry, for it ran on shore with remarkable\r\nswiftness, uttering a shrill cry as it advanced. At once all the other\r\nturtles awoke to life, and with upraised heads joined their comrade\r\nin the rush for the seals. Most of Chief Muffruff's band scrambled\r\nhastily down the rocks and plunged into the water of the sea, without\r\nwaiting for the turtles to reach them; but the chief himself was slow\r\nin escaping. It may be he was ashamed to run while the mermaids were\r\nwatching, but if this was so he made a great mistake. The turtles\r\nsnapped at his fins and tail, and began biting round chunks out\r\nof them, so that Chief Muffruff screamed with pain and anger, and\r\nfloundered into the water as fast as he could go. The vengeful turtles\r\nwere certainly the victors, and now held undisputed possession of the\r\nisland.\r\n\r\nTrot laughed joyously at the incident, not feeling a bit sorry for the\r\nold seal who had foolishly begun the battle. Even the gentle queen\r\nsmiled as she said:\r\n\r\n\"These quarrels between the turtles and seals are very frequent, but\r\nthey are soon ended. An hour from now they will all be lying asleep\r\ntogether, just as we found them; but we will not wait for that. Let us\r\ngo.\"\r\n\r\nShe sank slowly beneath the water again, and the others followed after\r\nher.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Chap. 11._\r\n\r\nZOG THE TERRIBLE AND HIS SEA DEVILS]\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The sun must be going under a cloud,\" said Trot, looking ahead.\r\n\r\nThey had descended far into the ocean depths again--further, the girl\r\nthought, than they had ever been before.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" the Queen answered, after a glance ahead of them; \"that is a\r\ncuttlefish, and he is dyeing the sea around him with ink, so that he\r\ncan hide from us. Let us turn a little to the left, for we could see\r\nnothing at all in that inky water.\"\r\n\r\nFollowing her advice they made a broad curve to the left, and at once\r\nthe water began to darken in that direction, too.\r\n\r\n\"Why, there's another of 'em,\" said Cap'n Bill, as the little party\r\ncame to a sudden halt.\r\n\r\n\"So there is,\" returned the Queen, and Trot thought there was a little\r\nquiver of anxiety in her voice. \"We must go far to the right to escape\r\nthe ink.\"\r\n\r\nSo they again started, this time almost at a right angle to their\r\nformer course, and the little girl inquired:\r\n\r\n\"How can the cuttlefish color the water so very black?\"\r\n\r\n\"They carry big sacks in front of them, where they conceal the ink,\"\r\nPrincess Clia answered. \"Whenever they choose, the cuttlefish are able\r\nto press out this ink, and it colors the water for a great space around\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\nThe direction in which they were now swimming was taking them far out\r\nof their way. Aquareine did not wish to travel very far to the right,\r\nso, when she thought they had gone far enough to escape the inky water,\r\nshe turned to lead her party toward the left--the direction in which\r\nshe did wish to go. At once, another cloud of ink stained the water,\r\nand drove them to the right again.\r\n\r\n\"Is anything wrong, ma'am?\" asked Cap'n Bill, seeing a frown gather\r\nupon the queen's lovely face.\r\n\r\n\"I hope not,\" she said. \"But I must warn you that these cuttlefish are\r\nthe servants of the terrible sea devils, and from the way they are\r\nacting they seem determined to drive us toward the Devil Caves, which I\r\nwished to avoid.\"\r\n\r\nThis admission on the part of their powerful protector, the fairy\r\nmermaid, sent a chill to the hearts of the earth people. Neither spoke\r\nfor a time, but finally Cap'n Bill asked in a timid voice:\r\n\r\n\"Hadn't we better go back, ma'am?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" decided Aquareine, after a moment's thought. \"I think it will be\r\nwise to retreat. The sea devils are evidently aware of our movements\r\nand wish to annoy us. For my part I have no fear of them, but I do not\r\ncare to have you meet such creatures.\"\r\n\r\nBut when they turned around to abandon their journey another inky cloud\r\nwas to be seen behind them. They really had no choice but to swim in\r\nthe only streak of clear water they could find, and the mermaids well\r\nknew this would lead them nearer and nearer to the caves of their\r\nenemies.\r\n\r\nBut Aquareine led the way, moving very slowly, and the others followed\r\nher. In every other direction they were hemmed in by the black waters,\r\nand they did not dare to halt, because the inky fluid crept swiftly up\r\nbehind them and drove them on.\r\n\r\nThe queen and the princess had now become silent and grave. They swam\r\non either side of their guests, as if to better protect them.\r\n\r\n\"Don't look up,\" whispered Clia, pressing close to the little girl's\r\nside.\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\" asked Trot; and then she did exactly what she had been told\r\nnot to do. She lifted her head and saw stretched over them a network of\r\nscrawny crimson arms, interlaced like the branches of trees in winter,\r\nwhen the leaves have fallen and left them bare.\r\n\r\nCap'n Bill gave a start and muttered \"Land sakes!\" for he, too, had\r\ngazed upward and seen the crimson network of limbs.\r\n\r\n\"Are these the sea devils?\" asked the child, more curious than\r\nfrightened.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, dear,\" replied the Queen. \"But I advise you to pay no attention\r\nto them. Remember, they cannot touch us.\"\r\n\r\nIn order to avoid the threatening arms overhead, which followed them\r\nas they swam, our friends kept near to the bottom of the sea, which\r\nwas here thickly covered with rough and jagged rocks. The inky water\r\nhad now been left far behind, but, when Trot looked over her shoulder,\r\nshe shuddered to find a great crimson monster following closely after\r\nthem, with a dozen long, snaky feelers stretched out as if to grab\r\nanyone that lagged behind. And there, at the side of Princess Clia,\r\nwas another sea devil, leering silently with his cruel, bulging eyes\r\nat the pretty mermaid. Beside the queen swam still another of their\r\nenemies. Indeed, the sea devils had crept upon them and surrounded them\r\neverywhere except at the front, and Trot began to feel nervous and\r\nworried for the first time.\r\n\r\nCap'n Bill kept mumbling queer words under his breath, for he had a way\r\nof talking to himself when anything \"upsot him,\" as he would quaintly\r\nremark. Trot always knew he was disturbed or in trouble when he began\r\nto \"growl.\"\r\n\r\nThe only way now open was straight ahead. They swam slowly, yet fast\r\nenough to keep a safe distance from the dreadful creature behind them.\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid they are driving us into a trap,\" whispered the Queen,\r\nsoftly; \"but, whatever happens, do not lose courage, earth friends.\r\nClia and I are here to protect you, and our fairy powers are sufficient\r\nto keep you from all harm.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I don't mind so very much,\" declared Trot, calmly. \"It's like the\r\nfairy adventures in storybooks, and I've often thought I'd like that\r\nkind of adventures, 'cause the story always turns out the right way.\"\r\n\r\nCap'n Bill growled something just then, but the only words Trot could\r\nmake out were, \"never lived to tell the tale.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, pshaw, Cap'n,\" she said; \"we may be in danger, right enough, an'\r\nto be honest I don't like the looks of these sea devils at all. But,\r\nI'm sure it's no _killing_ matter, for we've got the fairy circles all\r\naround us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ha, ha!\" laughed the monster beside her. \"_We_ know all about the\r\nfairy circles, don't we, Migg?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ho, ho!\" laughed the monster on the other side; \"we do, Slibb, my boy;\r\nand we don't think much of fairy circles, either!\"\r\n\r\n\"They have foiled our enemies many a time,\" declared the Princess, with\r\nmuch dignity.\r\n\r\n\"Ha, ha!\" laughed one; \"that's why we're here now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ho, ho!\" laughed the other; \"we've learned a trick or two, and we've\r\ngot you fast this time.\"\r\n\r\nThen all the sea devils--those above and the one behind, and the two\r\non the sides--laughed all together, and their laughter was so horrible\r\nthat it made even Trot shudder.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nBut, now the queen stopped short, and the others stopped with her.\r\n\r\n\"I will go no farther,\" she said, firmly, not caring if the creatures\r\noverheard her. \"It is evident that these monsters are trying to drive\r\nus into some secret place, and it is well-known that they are in\r\nleague with Zog the Terrible, whom they serve because they are as\r\nwicked as he is. We must be somewhere near the hidden castle of Zog, so\r\nI prefer to stay here rather than be driven into some place far more\r\ndangerous. As for the sea devils, they are powerless to injure us in\r\nany way. Not one of the thousand arms about us can possibly touch our\r\nbodies.\"\r\n\r\nThe only reply to this defiant speech was another burst of horrible\r\nlaughter; and now there suddenly appeared before them still another of\r\nthe monsters, which thus completely hemmed them in. Then the creatures\r\nbegan interlacing their long arms--or \"feelers\"--until they formed a\r\nperfect cage around the prisoners, not an opening being left that was\r\nlarge enough for one of them to escape through.\r\n\r\nThe mermaids and the girl and sailorman kept huddled close together,\r\nfor, although they might be walled in by the sea devils, their captors\r\ncould not touch them because of the protecting magic circles.\r\n\r\nAll at once Trot exclaimed: \"Why, we must be moving!\"\r\n\r\nThis was startling news, but by watching the flow of the water past\r\nthem they saw that the little girl was right. The sea devils were\r\nswimming, all together, and as the cage they were in moved forward our\r\nfriends were carried with it.\r\n\r\nQueen Aquareine had a stern look upon her beautiful face. Cap'n Bill\r\nguessed from this look that the mermaid was angry, for it seemed much\r\nlike the look Trot's mother wore when they came home late to dinner.\r\nBut however angry the queen might be, she was unable to help herself or\r\nher guests just now, or to escape from the guidance of the dreaded sea\r\ndevils. The rest of the party had become sober and thoughtful, and in\r\ndignified silence they awaited the outcome of this strange adventure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Chap. 12._\r\n\r\nTHE ENCHANTED ISLAND]\r\n\r\n\r\nAll at once it grew dark around them. Neither Cap'n Bill nor Trot\r\nliked this gloom, for it made them nervous not to be able to see their\r\nenemies.\r\n\r\n\"We must be near a sea cavern, if not within one,\" whispered Princess\r\nClia, and even as she spoke the network of scarlet arms parted before\r\nthem, leaving an avenue for them to swim out of the cage. There was\r\nbrighter water ahead, too, so the queen said, without hesitation:\r\n\r\n\"Come along, dear friends; but, let us clasp hands and keep close\r\ntogether.\"\r\n\r\nThey obeyed her commands and swam swiftly out of their prison and into\r\nthe clear water before them, glad to put a distance between themselves\r\nand the loathesome sea devils. The monsters made no attempt to follow\r\nthem, but they burst into a chorus of harsh laughter which warned our\r\nfriends that they had not yet accomplished their escape.\r\n\r\nThe four now found themselves in a broad, rocky passage, which was\r\ndimly lighted from some unknown source. The walls overhead, below them\r\nand at the sides all glistened, as if made of silver, and in places\r\nwere set small statues of birds, beasts and fishes, occupying niches in\r\nthe walls and seemingly made from the same glistening material.\r\n\r\nThe queen swam more slowly, now that the sea devils had been left\r\nbehind, and she looked exceedingly grave and thoughtful.\r\n\r\n\"Have you ever been here before?\" asked Trot.\r\n\r\n\"No, dear,\" said the Queen, with a sigh.\r\n\r\n\"And do you know where we are?\" continued the girl.\r\n\r\n\"I can guess,\" replied Aquareine. \"There is only one place in all the\r\nsea where such a passage as that we are in could exist without my\r\nknowledge, and that is in the hidden dominions of Zog. If we are indeed\r\nin the power of that fearful magician we must summon all our courage to\r\nresist him, or we are lost!\"\r\n\r\n\"Is Zog more powerful than the mermaids?\" asked Trot, anxiously.\r\n\r\n\"I do not know, for we have never before met to measure our strength,\"\r\nanswered Aquareine. \"But if King Anko could defeat the magician, as he\r\nsurely did, then I think I shall be able to do so.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish I was sure of it,\" muttered Cap'n Bill.\r\n\r\nAbsolute silence reigned in the silver passage. No fish were there;\r\nnot even a sea flower grew to relieve the stern grandeur of this vast\r\ncorridor. Trot began to be impressed with the fact that she was a good\r\nway from her home and mother, and she wondered if she would ever get\r\nback again to the white cottage on the cliff. Here she was, at the\r\nbottom of the great ocean, swimming through a big tunnel that had an\r\nenchanted castle at one end, and a group of horrible sea devils at the\r\nother! In spite of this thought she was not very much afraid. Although\r\ntwo fairy mermaids were her companions, she relied, strange to say,\r\nmore upon her tried and true friend Cap'n Bill, than upon her newer\r\nacquaintances to see her safely out of her present troubles.\r\n\r\nCap'n Bill himself did not feel very confident.\r\n\r\n\"I don't care two cents what becomes o' me,\" he told Princess Clia, in\r\na low voice, \"but I'm drea'ful worrited over our Trot. She's too sweet\r\nan' too young to be made an end of in this 'ere fashion.\"\r\n\r\nClia smiled at the speech.\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure you will find the little girl's end a good way off,\" she\r\nreplied. \"Trust to our powerful queen, and be sure she will find some\r\nmeans for us all to escape uninjured.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe light grew brighter as they advanced, until finally they perceived\r\na magnificent archway just ahead of them. Aquareine hesitated a\r\nmoment whether to go on, or turn back; but there was no escaping the\r\nsea devils behind them, and she decided the best way out of their\r\ndifficulties was to bravely face the unknown Zog, and rely upon her\r\nfairy powers to prevent his doing any mischief to herself or her\r\nfriends. So she led the way, and together they approached the archway\r\nand passed through it.\r\n\r\nThey now found themselves in a vast cavern, so great in extent that\r\nthe dome overhead looked like the sky when seen from the earth. In the\r\ncenter of this immense sea cavern rose the towers of a splendid castle,\r\nall built of coral inlaid with silver, and having windows of clear\r\nglass.\r\n\r\nSurrounding the castle were beds of beautiful sea flowers, many being\r\nin full bloom, and these were laid out with great care in artistic\r\ndesigns. Goldfish and silverfish darted here and there among the\r\nfoliage, and the whole scene was so pretty and peaceful that Trot began\r\nto doubt there was any danger lurking in such a lovely place.\r\n\r\nAs they paused to look around them, a brilliantly colored gregfish\r\napproached and gazed at them curiously with his big, saucer-like eyes.\r\n\r\n\"So Zog has got you at last!\" he said in a pitying tone. \"How foolish\r\nyou were to swim into that part of the sea where he is powerful.\"\r\n\r\n\"The sea devils made us,\" explained Clia.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'm sorry for you, I'm sure,\" remarked the Greg, and with a\r\nflash of his tail he disappeared among the sea foliage.\r\n\r\n\"Let us go to the castle,\" said the Queen, in a determined voice. \"We\r\nmay as well boldly defy our fate as to wait until Zog seeks us out.\"\r\n\r\nSo they swam to the entrance of the castle. The doors stood wide open\r\nand the interior seemed as well lighted as the cavern itself, although\r\nnone of them could discover from whence the light came.\r\n\r\nAt each side of the entrance lay a fish such as they had never seen\r\nbefore. It was flat as a doormat, and seemed to cling fast to the\r\ncoral floor. Upon its back were quills, like those of a porcupine, all\r\npointed and sharp. From the center of the fish arose a head shaped\r\nlike a round ball, with a circle of piercing, bead-like eyes set in\r\nit. These strange guardians of the entrance might be able to talk and\r\nto tell what their numerous eyes saw, yet they remained silent and\r\nwatchful. Even Aquareine gazed upon them curiously, and she gave a\r\nlittle shudder as she did so.\r\n\r\nInside the entrance was a domed hall, with a flight of stairs leading\r\nto an upper balcony. Around the hall were several doorways hung with\r\ncurtains made of woven seaweeds. Chairs and benches stood against the\r\nwall, and these astonished the visitors because neither stairs nor\r\nchairs seemed useful in a kingdom where every living thing was supposed\r\nto swim and have a fish's tail. In Queen Aquareine's palaces benches\r\nfor reclining were used, and stairs were wholly unnecessary; but in\r\nthe Palace of Zog the furniture and fittings were much like those\r\nof a house upon earth, and, except that every space was here filled\r\nwith water instead of air, Trot and Cap'n Bill might have imagined\r\nthemselves in a handsome earthly castle.\r\n\r\nThe little group paused half fearfully in the hall, yet so far, there\r\nwas surely nothing to be afraid of. They were wondering what to do\r\nnext, when the curtains of an archway were pushed aside and a boy\r\nentered. To Trot's astonishment he had legs, and walked upon them\r\nnaturally and with perfect ease. He was a delicate, frail looking\r\nlittle fellow, dressed in a black velvet suit with knee breeches. The\r\nbows at his throat and knees were of colored seaweeds, woven into broad\r\nribbons. His hair was yellow, and banged across his forehead. His eyes\r\nwere large and dark, with a pleasant, merry sparkle in them. Around\r\nhis neck he wore a high ruff, but in spite of this Trot could see that\r\nbelow his plump cheeks were several scarlet-edged slits that looked\r\nlike the gills of fishes, for they gently opened and closed as the boy\r\nbreathed in the water by which he was surrounded. These gills did not\r\ngreatly mar the lad's delicate beauty, and he spread out his arms and\r\nbowed low and gracefully in greeting.\r\n\r\n\"Hello,\" said Trot.\r\n\r\n\"Why, I'd like to,\" replied the boy, with a laugh, \"but, being a mere\r\nslave, it isn't proper for me to hello. But it's good to see earth\r\npeople again, and I'm glad you're here.\"\r\n\r\n\"We're not glad,\" observed the girl; \"we're afraid.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll get over that,\" declared the boy, smilingly. \"People lose a lot\r\nof time being afraid. Once I was myself afraid, but I found it was no\r\nfun, so I gave it up.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why were we brought here?\" inquired Queen Aquareine, gently.\r\n\r\n\"I can't say, madam, being a mere slave,\" replied the boy. \"But, you\r\nhave reminded me of my errand. I am sent to inform you all that Zog\r\nthe Forsaken, who hates all the world and is hated by all the world,\r\ncommands your presence in his den.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you hate Zog, too?\" asked Trot.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no,\" answered the boy. \"People lose a lot of time in hating\r\nothers, and there's no fun in it at all. Zog may be hateful, but I'm\r\nnot going to waste time hating him. You may do so, if you like.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are a queer child,\" remarked the Mermaid Queen, looking at him\r\nattentively. \"Will you tell us who you are?\"\r\n\r\n\"Once, I was Prince Sacho of Sacharhineolaland, which is a sweet\r\ncountry, but hard to pronounce,\" he answered. \"But in this domain I\r\nhave but one title and one name, and that is 'Slave.'\"\r\n\r\n\"How came you to be Zog's slave?\" asked Clia.\r\n\r\n\"The funniest adventure you ever heard of,\" asserted the boy, with\r\neager pride. \"I sailed in a ship that went to pieces in a storm. All\r\non board were drowned but me--and I came mighty near it, to tell the\r\ntruth. I went down deep, deep into the sea, and at the bottom was Zog,\r\nwatching the people drown. I tumbled on his head and he grabbed and\r\nsaved me, saying I would make a useful slave. By his magic power he\r\nmade me able to live under water, as the fishes live, and he brought me\r\nto this castle and taught me to wait upon him, as his other slaves do.\"\r\n\r\n\"Isn't it a dreadful, lonely life?\" asked Trot.\r\n\r\n\"No, indeed,\" said Sacho; \"we haven't any time to be lonely, and the\r\ndreadful things Zog does are very exciting and amusing, I assure\r\nyou. He keeps us guessing every minute, and that makes the life here\r\ninteresting. Things were getting a bit slow an hour ago, but now that\r\nyou are here I'm in hopes we will all be kept busy and amused for some\r\ntime.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are there many others in the castle besides you and Zog?\" asked\r\nAquareine.\r\n\r\n\"Dozens of us. Perhaps hundreds. I've never counted them,\" said the\r\nboy. \"But Zog is the only master; all the rest of us are in the same\r\nclass, so there is no jealousy among the slaves.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is Zog like?\" Cap'n Bill questioned.\r\n\r\nAt this the boy laughed, and the laugh was full of mischief.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"If I could tell you what Zog is like it would take me a year,\" was the\r\nreply. \"But I can't tell you. Every one has a different idea of what\r\nhe's like, and soon you will see him yourselves.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you fond of him?\" asked Trot.\r\n\r\n\"If I said yes, I'd get a good whipping,\" declared Sacho. \"I am\r\ncommanded to hate Zog, and being a good servant I try to obey. If\r\nanyone dared to like Zog I am sure he'd be instantly fed to the\r\nturtles; so I advise you not to like him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, we won't,\" promised Trot.\r\n\r\n\"But we're keeping the master waiting, and that is also a dangerous\r\nthing to do,\" continued the boy. \"If we don't hurry up Zog will begin\r\nto smile, and when he smiles there is trouble brewing.\"\r\n\r\nThe queen sighed.\r\n\r\n\"Lead the way, Sacho,\" she said. \"We will follow.\"\r\n\r\nThe boy bowed again, and going to an archway held aside the curtains\r\nfor them. They first swam into a small anteroom which led into a long\r\ncorridor, at the end of which was another curtained arch. Through this\r\nSacho also guided them, and now they found themselves in a cleverly\r\nconstructed maze. Every few feet were twists and turns, and sharp\r\ncorners, and sometimes the passage would be wide, and again so narrow\r\nthat they could just squeeze through in single file.\r\n\r\n\"Seems like we're gettin' further into the trap,\" growled Cap'n Bill.\r\n\"We couldn't find our way out o' here to save our lives.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes we could,\" replied Clia, who was just behind him. \"Such a maze\r\nmay indeed puzzle you, but the queen or I could lead you safely through\r\nit again, I assure you. Zog is not so clever as he thinks himself.\"\r\n\r\nThe sailor, however, found the maze very bewildering, and so did Trot.\r\nPassages ran in every direction, crossing and recrossing, and it seemed\r\nwonderful that the boy Sacho knew just which way to go. But he never\r\nhesitated an instant. Trot looked carefully to see if there were any\r\nmarks to guide him, but every wall was of plain, polished marble, and\r\nevery turning looked just like all the others.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Sacho stopped short. They were now in a broader passage, but\r\nas they gathered around their conductor, they found further advance\r\nblocked. Solid walls faced them, and here the corridor seemed to end.\r\n\r\n\"Enter!\" cried a clear voice.\r\n\r\n\"But we can't!\" protested Trot.\r\n\r\n\"Swim straight ahead,\" whispered the boy, in soft tones. \"There is no\r\nreal barrier before you. Your eyes are merely deceived by magic.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, I understand,\" said Aquareine, nodding her pretty head. And\r\nthen she took Mayre's hand and swam boldly forward, while Cap'n Bill\r\nfollowed holding the hand of Clia. And behold! the marble wall melted\r\naway before them, and they found themselves in a chamber more splendid\r\nthan even the fairy mermaids had ever seen before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Chap. 13._\r\n\r\nPRISONERS _OF THE_ SEA MONSTER]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe room in the enchanted castle which Zog called his \"den,\" and in\r\nwhich the wicked sea monster passed most of his time, was a perfectly\r\nshaped dome of solid gold. The upper part of this dome was thickly set\r\nwith precious jewels--diamonds, rubies, sapphires and emeralds, which\r\nsparkled beautifully through the crystal water. The lower walls were\r\nas thickly studded with pearls, all being of perfect shape and color.\r\nMany of the pearls were larger than any which may be found upon earth,\r\nfor the sea people know where to find the very best, and hide them away\r\nwhere men cannot discover them.\r\n\r\nThe golden floor was engraved with designs of rare beauty, depicting\r\nnot only sea life, but many adventures upon land. In the room were\r\nseveral large golden cabinets, the doors of which were closed and\r\nlocked, and in addition to the cabinets there were tables, chairs and\r\nsofas, the latter upholstered with softest sealskins. Handsome rugs of\r\nexquisitely woven seaweeds were scattered about, the colors of which\r\nwere artistically blended together. In one corner a fountain of air\r\nbubbled up through the water.\r\n\r\nThe entire room was lighted as brilliantly as if exposed to the direct\r\nrays of the sun, yet where this light came from our friends could not\r\nimagine. No lamp or other similar device was visible anywhere.\r\n\r\nThe strangers at first scarcely glanced at all these beautiful\r\nthings, for in an easy chair sat Zog himself, more wonderful than any\r\nother living creature, and as they gazed upon him their eyes seemed\r\nfascinated, as if held by a spell.\r\n\r\nZog's face was the face of a man, except that the tops of his ears\r\nwere pointed like horns and he had small horns instead of eyebrows,\r\nand a horn on the end of his chin. In spite of these deformities the\r\nexpression of the face was not unpleasant, or repulsive. His hair was\r\ncarefully parted and brushed, and his mouth and nose were not only\r\nperfect in shape, but quite handsome.\r\n\r\nOnly the eyes betrayed Zog and made him terrible to all beholders. They\r\nseemed like coals of glowing fire, and sparkled so fiercely that no one\r\never cared to meet their gaze for more than an instant. Perhaps the\r\nmonster realized this, for he usually drooped his long lashes over his\r\nfiery eyes to shut out their glare.\r\n\r\nZog had two well shaped legs which ended in the hoofs of beasts,\r\ninstead of feet, and these hoofs were shod with gold. His body was a\r\nshapeless mass covered with richly embroidered raiment, over which a\r\ngreat robe of cloth of gold fell in many folds. This robe was intended\r\nto hide the magician's body from view, but Trot noticed that the cloth\r\nmoved constantly, in little ripples, as if what lay underneath would\r\nnot keep still.\r\n\r\nThe best features of which Zog could boast were his arms and hands,\r\nthe latter being as well formed, as delicate and white as those of a\r\nwell-bred woman. When he spoke, his voice sounded sweet and clear, and\r\nits tones were very gentle. He had given them a few moments to stare at\r\nhim, for he was examining them, in turn, with considerable curiosity.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said he, \"do you not find me the most hateful creature you have\r\never beheld?\"\r\n\r\nThe queen refrained from answering, but Trot said, promptly:\r\n\r\n\"We do. Nothing could be more horrider or more disgustin' than you are,\r\nit seems to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good; very good, indeed,\" declared the monster, lifting his\r\nlashes to flash his glowing eyes upon her. Then he turned toward Cap'n\r\nBill. \"Man-fish,\" he continued, \"what do _you_ think of me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mighty little,\" the sailor replied. \"You orter be 'shamed to ask sech\r\na question, knowin' you look worse ner the devil himself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very true,\" answered Zog, frowning. He felt that he had received a\r\nhigh compliment, and the frown showed he was pleased with Cap'n Bill.\r\n\r\nBut now Queen Aquareine advanced to a position in front of their captor\r\nand said:\r\n\r\n\"Tell me, Zog; why have you trapped us and brought us here?\"\r\n\r\n\"To destroy you,\" was the quick answer, and the magician turned for an\r\ninstant to flash his eyes upon the beautiful mermaid. \"For two hundred\r\nyears I have been awaiting a chance to get within my power some friend\r\nof Anko the Sea Serpent--of Anko, whom I hate!\" he added, smiling\r\nsweetly. \"When you left your palace to-day my swift spies warned me,\r\nand so I sent the sea devils to capture you. Often have they tried to\r\ndo this before, but always failed. To-day, acting by my command, they\r\ntricked you, and by surrounding you, forced you to the entrance of my\r\nenchanted castle. The result is a fine capture of important personages.\r\nI have now in my power the queen and princess of the fairy mermaids,\r\nas well as two wandering earth people, and I assure you I shall take\r\ngreat enjoyment in destroying you utterly.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are a coward,\" declared the Queen, proudly. \"You dared not meet us\r\nin the open sea.\"\r\n\r\n\"No; I dare not leave this castle,\" Zog admitted, still smiling. \"But\r\nhere, in my own domain, my power is supreme. Nothing can interfere with\r\nmy vengeance.\"\r\n\r\n\"That remains to be seen,\" said Aquareine, firmly meeting the gaze of\r\nthe terrible eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" he answered, nodding his head with a graceful movement.\r\n\"You will try to thwart me and escape. You will pit your fairy power\r\nagainst my powers of magic. This will give me great pleasure, for the\r\nmore you struggle the greater will be my revenge.\"\r\n\r\n\"But why should you seek revenge upon us?\" asked Clia. \"We have never\r\nharmed you.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is true,\" replied Zog. \"I bear you no personal ill will. But you\r\nare friends of my great enemy, King Anko, and it will annoy him very\r\nmuch when he finds that you have been destroyed by me. I cannot hurt\r\nthe rascally old sea serpent himself, but through you I can make him\r\nfeel my vengeance.\"\r\n\r\n\"The mermaids have existed thousands of years,\" said the Queen, in a\r\ntone of pride. \"Do you imagine the despised and conquered Zog has power\r\nto destroy them?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not know,\" was the quiet answer. \"It will be interesting to\r\ndiscover which is the more powerful.\"\r\n\r\n\"I challenge you to begin the test at once, vile magician!\" exclaimed\r\nAquareine.\r\n\r\n\"There is no hurry, fair Queen,\" answered Zog, in his softest tones.\r\n\"I have been so many years in accomplishing your capture that it is\r\nfoolish to act hastily now. Besides, I am lonely. Here, in my forced\r\nretirement, I see only those uninteresting earth mortals whom I have\r\nmade my slaves, for all sea dwellers are forbidden to serve me save\r\nthe sea devils, and they dare not enter my castle. I have saved many\r\nmortals from drowning and brought them here to people my castle, but I\r\ndo not love mortals. Two lovely mermaids are much more interesting, and\r\nbefore I allow you to perish I shall have much amusement in witnessing\r\nyour despair, and your struggles to escape. You are now my prisoners.\r\nBy slow degrees I shall wear out your fairy powers and break your\r\nhearts, as well as the hearts of these earth dwellers who have no magic\r\npowers, and I think it will be a long time before I finally permit you\r\nto die.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's all right,\" said Trot, cheerfully. \"The longer I live the\r\nbetter I'll be satisfied.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's how I feel about it,\" added Cap'n Bill. \"Don't get in a hurry\r\nto kill us, Zog; it'll be such a wear an' tear on your nerves. Jes'\r\ntake it easy an' let us live as long as we can.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you care to die?\" asked the magician.\r\n\r\n\"It's a thing I never longed for,\" the sailor replied. \"You see, we\r\nhad no business to go on a trip with the mermaids, to begin with. I've\r\nallus heard tell that mermaids is dangerous, an' no one as met 'em ever\r\nlived to tell the tale. Eh, Trot?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's what you said, Cap'n Bill.\"\r\n\r\n\"So, I guess we're done for, one way 'r 'nother; an' it don't matter\r\nmuch which. But Trot's a good child, an' mighty young an' tender. It\r\ndon't seem like her time has come to die. I'd like to have her sent\r\nsafe home to her mother. So I've got this 'ere propersition to make,\r\nZog: If your magic could make _me_ die twice, or even _three_ times fer\r\ngood measure, why you go ahead an' do it an' I won't complain. All I\r\nask is fer you to send this little girl safe back to dry land again.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you do it, Zog!\" cried Trot, indignantly, and turning to Cap'n\r\nBill she added: \"I'm not goin' to leave you down here in all this mess,\r\nCap'n, and don't you think it. If one of us gets out of the muddle\r\nwe're in, we'll both get out; so don't you make any bargains with Zog\r\nto die twice.\"\r\n\r\nZog listened to this conversation very carefully.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAKE ME DIE TWICE]\r\n\r\n\"The dying does not amount to much,\" he said; \"it is the thinking\r\nabout it that hurts you mortals most. I've watched many a shipwreck at\r\nsea, and the people would howl and scream for hours before the ship\r\nbroke up. Their terror was very enjoyable. But when the end came they\r\nall drowned as peacefully as if they were going to sleep, so it didn't\r\namuse me at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not worrying,\" said Trot.\r\n\r\n\"Ner me,\" said Cap'n Bill. \"You'll find we can take what comes jes' as\r\neasy as anybody.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not expect to get much fun from you poor mortals,\" said Zog,\r\ncarelessly. \"You are merely a side show to my circus--a sort of dessert\r\nto my feast of vengeance. When the time comes I can find a hundred ways\r\nto kill you. My most interesting prisoners are these pretty mermaids,\r\nwho claim that none of their race has ever yet died, or been destroyed.\r\nThe first mermaid ever created is living yet--and I am told she is none\r\nother than Queen Aquareine. So I have a pretty problem before me, to\r\ninvent some way to destroy the mermaids, or put them out of existence.\r\nAnd it will require some thought.\"\r\n\r\n\"Also, it will require some power you do not possess,\" suggested the\r\nQueen.\r\n\r\n\"That may be,\" replied Zog, softly; \"but I am going to experiment, and\r\nI believe I shall be able to cause you a lot of pain and sorrow before\r\nI finally make an end of you. I have not lived twenty-seven thousand\r\nyears, Aquareine, without getting a certain amount of wisdom, and I am\r\nmore powerful than you suspect.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are a monster and a wicked magician,\" said the Mermaid Queen.\r\n\r\n\"I am,\" agreed Zog; \"but I cannot help it. I was created part man, part\r\nbird, part fish, part beast and part reptile, and such a monstrosity\r\ncould not be otherwise than wicked. Everybody hates me, and I hate\r\neverybody.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why don't you kill yourself?\" asked Trot.\r\n\r\n\"I've tried that, and failed,\" he answered. \"Only one being in the\r\nworld has power to destroy me, and that is King Anko, the sea serpent.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you'd better let him do it,\" advised the little girl.\r\n\r\n\"No; much as I long to die, I cannot allow King Anko the pleasure of\r\nkilling me. He has always been my worst enemy, and it would be such a\r\njoy to him to kill me that I really cannot allow him. Indeed, I have\r\nalways hoped to kill Anko. I have now been three thousand six hundred\r\nand forty-two years, eleven months and nine days figuring out a plan to\r\ndestroy old Anko, and as yet I have not discovered a way.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd give it up, if I were you,\" advised Trot. \"Don't you think you\r\ncould get some fun out of trying to be good?\"\r\n\r\n\"No!\" cried Zog, and his voice was not so soft as before. \"Listen,\r\nAquareine: You and your attendants shall be prisoners in this castle\r\nuntil I can manage to stop you from living. Rooms will be placed at\r\nyour disposal, and I wish you to go to them at once, as I am tired of\r\nlooking at you.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're no more tired than we are,\" remarked Trot. \"It's lucky you\r\ncan't see yourself, Zog.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nHe turned his glowing eyes full upon her.\r\n\r\n\"The worst of my queer body I keep concealed,\" he said. \"If ever you\r\nsee it, you will scream with terror.\"\r\n\r\nHe touched a bell beside him and the girl was surprised to find how\r\nclearly its tones rang out through the water. In an instant the boy\r\nSacho appeared and bowed low before his dreadful master.\r\n\r\n\"Take the mermaids and the child to the Rose Chamber,\" commanded Zog;\r\n\"and take the old man-fish to the Peony Room.\"\r\n\r\nSacho turned to obey.\r\n\r\n\"Are the outer passages well guarded?\" asked the monster.\r\n\r\n\"Yes; as you have commanded,\" said the boy.\r\n\r\n\"Then you may allow the prisoners to roam at will throughout the\r\ncastle. Now, go!\"\r\n\r\nThe prisoners followed Sacho from the room, glad to get away. The\r\npresence of this evil being had grown oppressive to them, and Zog had\r\nhimself seemed ill at ease during the last few minutes. The robe so\r\nclosely wound around his body moved jerkily, as if something beneath\r\ndisturbed it, and at such times Zog shifted nervously in his seat.\r\n\r\nSacho's thin little legs trotted through the water, and led the way\r\ninto a different passage from the one by which they had entered. They\r\nswam slowly after him and breathed easier when they had left the golden\r\ndomed chamber, where their wicked enemy sat enthroned.\r\n\r\n\"Well, how do you like him?\" asked Sacho, with a laugh.\r\n\r\n\"We hate him!\" declared Trot, emphatically.\r\n\r\n\"Of course you do,\" replied Sacho. \"But, you're wasting time hating\r\nanything. It doesn't do you any good, or him any harm. Can you sing?\"\r\n\r\n\"A little,\" said Trot; \"but I don't feel like singing now.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"You're wrong about that,\" the boy asserted. \"Anything that keeps you\r\nfrom singing is foolishness, unless it's laughter. Laughter, joy and\r\nsong are the only good things in the world.\"\r\n\r\nTrot did not answer this queer speech, for just then they came to a\r\nflight of stairs, and Sacho climbed up them, while the others swam. And\r\nnow they were in a lofty, broad corridor having many doors hung with\r\nseaweed draperies. At one of these doorways Sacho stopped and said:\r\n\r\n\"Here is the Rose Chamber, where the master commands you to live until\r\nyou die. You may wander anywhere in the castle as you please; to leave\r\nit is impossible. Whenever you return to the Rose Chamber you will know\r\nit by this design of roses, sewn in pearls upon the hangings. The Peony\r\nRoom, where the man-fish is to live, is the next one farther on.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you,\" replied Queen Aquareine. \"Are we to be fed?\"\r\n\r\n\"Meals will be served in your rooms. If you desire anything, ring the\r\nbell and some of the slaves will be sure to answer it. I am mostly in\r\nattendance upon my master, but whenever I am at liberty I will look\r\nafter your comfort myself.\"\r\n\r\nAgain they thanked the strange boy, and he turned and left them. They\r\ncould hear him whistle and sing as he returned along the passage. Then\r\nPrincess Clia parted the curtains that her queen and companions might\r\nenter the Rose Chamber.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Chap. 14._\r\n\r\nCAP'N JOE _and_ CAP'N BILL]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rooms Zog had given his prisoners were as handsome as all other\r\nparts of this strange, enchanted castle. Gold was used plentifully in\r\nthe decorations, and in the Rose Chamber occupied by the mermaids and\r\nTrot, golden roses formed a border around the entire room. The sea\r\nmaidens had evidently been expected, for the magician had provided\r\ncouches for them to recline upon, similar to the ones used in the\r\nmermaid palaces. The frames were of mother-of-pearl and the cushions of\r\nsoft, white sponges. In the room were toilet tables, mirrors, ornaments\r\nand many articles used by earth people, which they afterward learned\r\nhad been plundered by Zog from sunken ships and brought to his castle\r\nby his allies, the sea devils.\r\n\r\nWhile the mermaids were examining and admiring their room, Cap'n Bill\r\nwent to the Peony Room to see what it was like, and found his quarters\r\nvery cosy and interesting. There were pictures on the walls--portraits\r\nof grave-looking porpoises, bashful seals, and smug and smiling\r\nwalruses. Some of the wall panels were formed of mirrors and reflected\r\nclearly the interior of the room. Around the ceiling was a frieze of\r\nimitation peonies in silver, and the furniture was peony-shaped, the\r\nbroad leaves being bent to form seats and couches.\r\n\r\nBeside a pretty dressing table hung a bell cord, with a tassel at the\r\nend. Cap'n Bill did not know it was a bell cord, so he pulled it to see\r\nwhat would happen and was puzzled to find that nothing seemed to happen\r\nat all, the bell being too far away for him to hear it. Then he began\r\nlooking at the treasures contained in this royal apartment, and was\r\nmuch pleased with a golden statue of a mermaid, that resembled Princess\r\nClia in feature. A silver flower vase upon a stand contained a bouquet\r\nof gorgeous peonies, \"as nat'ral as life,\" said Cap'n Bill, although he\r\nsaw plainly that they must be made of metal.\r\n\r\nTrot came in just then to see how her dear friend was located. She\r\nentered from the doorway that connected the two rooms, and said:\r\n\r\n\"Isn't it pretty, Cap'n? And who'd ever think that awful creature Zog\r\nowned such a splendid castle, and kept his prisoners in such lovely\r\nrooms?\"\r\n\r\n\"I once heard tell,\" said the sailor, \"of a foreign people that\r\nsacrificed human bein's to please their pagan gods; an' before they\r\nkilled 'em outright they stuffed the victims full o' good things to\r\neat, an' dressed 'em in pretty clothes, an' treated 'em like princes.\r\nThat's why I don't take much comfort in our fine surroundin's, Trot.\r\nThis Zog is a pagan, if ever there was one, an' he don't mean us any\r\ngood, you may depend on't.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied Trot, soberly; \"I'm sure he doesn't expect us to be happy\r\nhere. But, I'm going to fool him and have just as good a time as I can.\"\r\n\r\nAs she spoke they both turned around--an easy thing to do with a single\r\nflop of their flexible tails--and Cap'n Bill uttered a cry of surprise.\r\nJust across the room stood a perfect duplicate of himself. The round\r\nhead, with its bald top and scraggly whiskers, the sailor cap and\r\nshirt, the wide pantaloons--even the wooden leg--each and every one\r\nwere exact copies of those owned by Cap'n Bill. Even the expression in\r\nthe light blue eyes was the same, and it is no wonder the old sailor\r\nstared at his \"double\" in amazement. But the next minute he laughed,\r\nand said:\r\n\r\n\"Why, Trot, it's _me_ reflected in a mirror. But, at first, I thought\r\nit was some one else.\"\r\n\r\nTrot was staring, too.\r\n\r\n\"Look, Cap'n!\" she whispered; \"look at the wooden leg.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it's _my_ wooden leg, ain't it?\" he inquired.\r\n\r\n\"If it is, it can't be a reflection in a mirror,\" she argued, \"for\r\n_you_ haven't got a wooden leg. You've got a fish's tail.\"\r\n\r\nThe old sailor was so startled by this truth that he gave a great flop\r\nwith his tail that upset his balance, and made him keel a somersault in\r\nthe water before he got right side up again. Then he found the other\r\nsailorman laughing at him, and was horrified to find the \"reflection\"\r\nadvancing toward them, by stumping along on its wooden leg.\r\n\r\n\"Keep away! Git out, there!\" yelled Cap'n Bill. \"You're a ghost--the\r\nghost o' me that once was--an' I can't bear the sight o' you. Git out!\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you ring jes' to tell me to git out?\" asked the other, in a mild\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n\"I--I didn't ring,\" declared Cap'n Bill.\r\n\r\n\"You did; you pulled that bell cord,\" said the one-legged.\r\n\r\n\"Oh; did pullin' that thing ring a bell?\" inquired the Cap'n, a little\r\nashamed of his ignorance and reassured by hearing the \"ghost\" talk.\r\n\r\n\"It surely did,\" was the reply; \"and Sacho told me to answer your bell\r\nan' look after you. So I'm a-lookin' after you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish you wouldn't,\" protested Cap'n Bill. \"I've no use\r\nfer--fer--ghostses, anyhow.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: YOU'RE A GHOST!]\r\n\r\nThe strange sailor began to chuckle at hearing this, and his chuckle\r\nwas just like Cap'n Bill's chuckle--so full of merry humor that it\r\nusually made every one laugh with him.\r\n\r\n\"Who are you?\" asked Trot, who was very curious and much surprised.\r\n\r\n\"I'm Cap'n Joe,\" was the reply. \"Cap'n Joe Weedles, formerly o' the\r\nbrig 'Gladsome' an' now a slave o' Zog at the bottom o' the sea.\"\r\n\r\n\"J--J--Joe Wee--Weedles!\" gasped Cap'n Bill, amazed; \"Joe Weedles o'\r\nthe 'Gladsome'! Why, dash my eyes, mate, you must be my brother!\"\r\n\r\n\"Are _you_ Bill Weedles?\" asked the other. And then he added: \"But,\r\nno; you can't be. Bill wasn't no merman. He were a human critter, like\r\nmyself.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's what _I_ am,\" said Cap'n Bill, hastily; \"I'm a human critter,\r\ntoo. I've jes' borrered this fishtail to swim with while I'm visitin'\r\nthe mermaids.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, well,\" said Cap'n Joe, in astonishment; \"who'd 'a' thought it!\r\nAn' who'd ever 'a' thought as I'd find my long lost brother in Zog's\r\nenchanted castle, full fifty fathoms deep down in the wet, wet water!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, as fer that,\" replied Cap'n Bill, \"it's _you_ as is the long lost\r\nbrother, not me. You an' your ship disappeared many a year ago, an'\r\nain't never been heard of since; while, as fer me, I'm livin' on earth\r\nyet.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't look it, to all appearances,\" remarked Cap'n Joe, in a\r\nreflective tone of voice. \"But I'll agree it's many a year since I saw\r\nthe top o' the water, an' I'm not expectin' to ever tramp on dry land\r\nagain.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you dead, or drownded, or what?\" asked Cap'n Bill.\r\n\r\n\"Neither one nor t'other,\" was the answer. \"But Zog gave me gills,\r\nso's I could live in the water like fishes do, an' if I got on land I\r\ncouldn't breathe air any more 'n a fish out o' water can. So I guess as\r\nlong as I live I'll hev to stay down here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you like it?\" asked Trot.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I don't objec' much,\" said Cap'n Joe. \"There ain't much excitement\r\nhere, fer we don't catch a flock o' mermaids ev'ry day; but the work is\r\neasy an' the rations fair. I might 'a' been worse off, you know, for\r\nwhen my brig was wrecked I'd 'a' gone to Davy Jones's Locker if Zog\r\nhadn't happened to find me an' made me a fish.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't look as much like a fish as Cap'n Bill does,\" observed Trot.\r\n\r\n\"P'raps not,\" said Cap'n Joe; \"but I notice Bill ain't got any gills,\r\nan' breathes like you an' the mermaids does. When he gets back to land\r\nhe'll have his two legs again, an' live in comfort breathin' air.\"\r\n\r\n\"I won't have two legs,\" asserted Cap'n Bill, \"for when I'm on earth\r\nI'm fitted with one wooden leg, jes' the same as you are, Joe.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh; I hadn't heard o' that, Bill; but I'm not surprised,\" replied\r\nBrother Joe. \"Many a sailor gets to wear a wooden leg, in time. Mine's\r\nhick'ry.\"\r\n\r\n\"So's mine,\" said Cap'n Bill, with an air of pride. \"I'm glad I've run\r\nacross you, Joe, for I often wondered what had become of you. Seems too\r\nbad, though, to have you spend all your life under water.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's the odds?\" asked Cap'n Joe. \"I never could keep away from the\r\nwater since I was a boy, an' there's more dangers to be met floatin'\r\non it than there is soakin' in it. An' one other thing pleases me when\r\nI think on it: I'm parted from my wife--a mighty good woman with a\r\ntongue like a two-edge sword--an' my pore widder'll get the insurance\r\nmoney an' live happy. As fer me, Bill, I'm a good deal happier than I\r\nwas when she kep' scoldin' me from mornin' to night every minute I was\r\nhome.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is Zog a kind master?\" asked Trot.\r\n\r\n\"I can't say he's kind,\" replied Cap'n Joe, \"for he's as near a devil\r\nas any livin' critter _can_ be. He grumbles an' growls in his soft\r\nvoice all day, an' hates himself an' everybody else. But I don't see\r\nmuch of him. There's so many of us slaves here that Zog don't pay much\r\nattention to us, an' we have a pretty good time when the ol' magician\r\nis shut up in his den, as he mostly is.\"\r\n\r\n\"Could you help us to escape?\" asked the child.\r\n\r\n\"Why, I don't know how,\" admitted Cap'n Joe. \"There's magic all around\r\nus, and we slaves are never allowed to leave this great cave. I'll do\r\nwhat I can, o' course; but Sacho is the boy to help you, if anyone\r\ncan. That little chap knows a heap, I can tell you. So now, if nothin'\r\nmore's wanted, I must get back to work.\"\r\n\r\n\"What work do you do?\" Cap'n Bill asked.\r\n\r\n\"I sew buttons on Zog's clothes. Every time he gets mad he busts his\r\nbuttons off, an' I have to sew 'em on again. As he's mad most o' the\r\ntime, it keeps me busy.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll see you again, won't I, Joe?\" said Cap'n Bill.\r\n\r\n\"No reason why you shouldn't--if you manage to keep alive,\" said Cap'n\r\nJoe. \"But you mustn't forget, Bill, that Zog has his grip on you, an'\r\nI've never known anything to escape him yet.\"\r\n\r\nSaying this the old sailor began to stump toward the door, but tripped\r\nhis foot against his wooden leg and gave a swift dive forward. He\r\nwould have fallen flat had he not grabbed the drapery at the doorway,\r\nand saved himself by holding fast to it with both hands. Even then he\r\nrolled and twisted so awkwardly before he could get upon his legs that\r\nTrot had to laugh outright at his antics.\r\n\r\n\"This hick'ry leg,\" said Cap'n Joe, \"is so blamed light that it always\r\nwants to float. Agga-Groo, the goldworker, has promised me a gold leg,\r\nthat will stay down; but he never has time to make it. You're mighty\r\nlucky, Bill, to have a merman's tail, instead o' legs.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"I guess I am, Joe,\" replied Bill; \"for in such a wet country the\r\nfishes have the best of it. But I ain't sure I'd like this sort o'\r\nthing always.\"\r\n\r\n\"Think o' the money you'd make in a side show,\" said Cap'n Joe, with\r\nhis funny chuckling laugh. Then he pounded his wooden leg against the\r\nhard floor, and managed to hobble from the room without more accidents.\r\n\r\nWhen he had gone, Trot said:\r\n\r\n\"Aren't you glad to find your brother again, Cap'n Bill?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, so-so,\" replied the sailor. \"I don't know much about Joe, seein'\r\nas we haven't met before for many a long year; an' all I remember about\r\nour boyhood days is that we fit an' pulled hair most o' the time. But\r\nwhat worries me most is Joe's lookin' so much like me myself--wooden\r\nleg an' all. Don't you think it's rather cheeky an' unbrotherly, Trot?\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps he can't help it,\" suggested the child. \"And, anyhow, he'll\r\nnever be able to live on land again.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Cap'n Bill, with a sigh, \"Joe's a fish, now, an' so he ain't\r\nlikely to be took for me by any of our friends on the earth.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Chap. 15._\r\n\r\n_The_ MAGIC _of the_ MERMAIDS]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Trot and Cap'n Bill entered the Rose Chamber they found the two\r\nmermaids reclining before an air fountain that was sending thousands of\r\ntiny bubbles up through the water.\r\n\r\n\"These fountains of air are excellent things,\" remarked Queen\r\nAquareine, \"for they keep the water fresh and sweet, and that is\r\nthe more necessary where it is confined by walls, as it is in this\r\ncastle. But, now let us counsel together, and decide what to do in the\r\nemergency that confronts us.\"\r\n\r\n\"How can we tell what to do, without knowing what's going to happen?\"\r\nasked Trot.\r\n\r\n\"Something's sure to happen,\" said Cap'n Bill.\r\n\r\nAs if to prove his words a gong suddenly sounded at their door, and in\r\nwalked a fat little man clothed all in white, including a white apron\r\nand white cap. His face was round and jolly, and he had a big mustache\r\nthat curled up at the ends.\r\n\r\n\"Well, well!\" said the little man, spreading out his legs and putting\r\nhis hands on his hips as he stood looking at them; \"of all the queer\r\nthings in the sea, you're the queerest! Mermaids, eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't bunch us that way!\" protested Cap'n Bill.\r\n\r\n\"You are quite wrong,\" said Trot; \"I'm a--a girl.\"\r\n\r\n\"With a fish's tail?\" he asked, laughing at her.\r\n\r\n\"That's only just for a while,\" she said; \"while I'm in the water, you\r\nknow. When I'm at home on the land I walk just as you do--an' so does\r\nCap'n Bill.\"\r\n\r\n\"But we haven't any gills,\" remarked the Cap'n, looking closely at the\r\nlittle man's throat; \"so I take it we're not as fishy as some others.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you mean me, I must admit you are right,\" said the little man,\r\ntwisting his mustaches. \"I'm as near a fish as a man can be. But you\r\nsee, Cap'n, without the gills that make me a fish I could not live\r\nunder water.\"\r\n\r\n\"When it comes to that, you've no business to live under water,\"\r\nasserted the sailor. \"But I s'pose you're a slave and can't help it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm chief cook for that old horror, Zog. And that reminds me, good\r\nmermaids--or good people, or good girls and sailors, or whatever you\r\nare--that I'm sent here to ask what you'd like to eat.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"Glad to see you, sir,\" said Cap'n Bill. \"I'm nearly starved, myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"I had it in mind,\" said the little man, \"to prepare a regular mermaid\r\ndinner; but since you're not mermaids--\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, two of us are,\" said the Queen, smiling. \"I, my good cook, am\r\nAquareine, the ruler of the mermaids, and this is the Princess Clia.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've often heard of you, your Majesty,\" returned the chief cook,\r\nbowing respectfully, \"and I must say I've heard only good of you. Now\r\nthat you have unfortunately become my master's prisoners it will give\r\nme pleasure to serve you as well as I am able.\"\r\n\r\n\"We thank you, good sir,\" said Aquareine.\r\n\r\n\"What have you got to eat?\" inquired Trot. \"Seems to me I'm hollow way\r\ndown to my toes--my tail, I mean--and it'll take a lot to fill me up.\r\nWe haven't eaten a morsel since breakfast, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think I shall be able to give you almost anything you would like,\"\r\nsaid the cook. \"Zog is a wonderful magician, and can procure anything\r\nthat exists with no more effort than a wiggle of his thumb. But some\r\neatables, you know, are hard to serve under water, because they get so\r\ndamp that they are soon ruined.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, it is different with the mermaids,\" said Princess Clia.\r\n\r\n\"Yes; all your things are kept dry because they are surrounded by air.\r\nI've heard how the mermaids live. But here it is different.\"\r\n\r\n\"Take this ring,\" said the Queen, handing the chief cook a circlet\r\nwhich she drew from her finger. \"While it is in your possession the\r\nfood you prepare will not get wet--or even moist.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thank your Majesty,\" returned the cook, taking the ring. \"My name\r\nis Tom Atto, and I'll do my best to please you. How would you like for\r\nluncheon some oysters on the half shell, clam broth, shrimp salad,\r\nbroiled turtle steak and watermelon?\"\r\n\r\n\"That will do very nicely,\" answered the Queen.\r\n\r\n\"Do watermelons grow in the sea?\" asked Trot.\r\n\r\n\"Of course; that is why they are called watermelons,\" replied Tom Atto.\r\n\"I think I shall serve you a water ice, in addition to the rest. Water\r\nice is an appropriate sea food.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have some water cress with the salad,\" said Cap'n Bill.\r\n\r\n\"I'd thought of that,\" declared the cook. \"Doesn't my bill of fare make\r\nyour mouths water?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hurry up and get it ready,\" suggested Trot.\r\n\r\nTom Atto at once bowed and retired, and when they were alone, Cap'n\r\nBill said to the queen:\r\n\r\n\"Do you think, ma'am, we can manage to escape from Zog and his castle?\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope we shall find a way,\" replied Aquareine. \"The evil powers of\r\nmagic, which Zog controls, may not prove to be as strong as the fairy\r\npowers I possess; but of course I cannot be positive until I discover\r\nwhat this wicked magician is able to do.\"\r\n\r\nPrincess Clia was looking out of one of the windows.\r\n\r\n\"I think I can see an opening far up in the top of the dome,\" she said.\r\n\r\nThey all hastened to the windows to look, and although Trot and Cap'n\r\nBill could see nothing but a solid dome above the castle--perhaps,\r\nbecause it was so far away from them--the sharp eyes of Aquareine were\r\nnot to be deceived.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" she announced, \"there is surely an opening in the center of the\r\ngreat dome. A little thought must convince us that such an opening is\r\nbound to exist, for otherwise the water confined within the dome would\r\nnot be fresh or clear.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, if we could escape from this castle, we could swim up to the\r\nhole in the dome and get free!\" exclaimed Trot.\r\n\r\n\"Why, Zog has probably ordered the opening well guarded, as he has all\r\nother outlets,\" responded the Queen. \"Yet it may be worth while for\r\nus to make the attempt to get back into the broad ocean this way. The\r\nnight would be the best time, when all are asleep; and surely it will\r\nbe quicker to reach the ocean through this hole in the roof, than by\r\nmeans of the long, winding passages by which we entered.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"But we will have to break out of the castle, in some way,\" observed\r\nCap'n Bill.\r\n\r\n\"That will not be difficult,\" answered Aquareine. \"It will be no\r\ntrouble for me to shatter one of these panes of glass, allowing us to\r\npass out and swim straight up to the top of the dome.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let's do it now!\" said Trot, eagerly.\r\n\r\n\"No, my dear; we must wait for a good opportunity, when we are not\r\nwatched closely. We do not wish the terrible Zog to thwart our plan,\"\r\nanswered the Queen, gently.\r\n\r\nPresently, two sailor boys entered, bearing trays of food which they\r\nplaced upon a large table. They were cheery-faced young fellows, with\r\ngills at their throats but had laughing eyes, and Trot was astonished\r\nnot to find any of the slaves of Zog weeping or miserable. Instead,\r\nthey were as jolly and good-natured as could be, and seemed to like\r\ntheir life under the water. Cap'n Bill asked one of these boys how many\r\nslaves were in the castle, and the youth replied that he would try to\r\ncount them and let him know.\r\n\r\nTom Atto had, they found, prepared for them an excellent meal, and they\r\nate heartily because they were really hungry. After luncheon Cap'n\r\nBill smoked his pipe contentedly and they renewed their conversation,\r\nplanning various ways to outwit Zog and make their escape. While thus\r\nengaged the gong at the door sounded and Sacho entered.\r\n\r\n\"My diabolical master commands you to attend him,\" said the boy.\r\n\r\n\"When?\" asked Aquareine.\r\n\r\n\"At once, your Majesty.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well; we will follow you,\" she said.\r\n\r\nSo they swam down the corridors, following Sacho, until they again\r\nreached the golden domed room they had formerly visited.\r\n\r\nHere sat Zog, just as they had left him, seemingly; but when his\r\nprisoners entered the magician arose and stood upon his cloven feet,\r\nand then silently walked to a curtained archway.\r\n\r\nSacho commanded the prisoners to follow, and beyond the archway they\r\nfound a vast chamber that occupied the center of the castle and was\r\nas big as a ballroom. Zog, who seemed to walk with much difficulty\r\nbecause his ungainly body swayed back and forth, did not go far beyond\r\nthe arched entrance. A golden throne was set near by, and in this the\r\nmonster seated himself.\r\n\r\nAt one side of the throne stood a group of slaves. They were men, women\r\nand children. All had broad gold bands clasped around their ankles, as\r\na badge of servitude, and at each throat were the fish's gills that\r\nenabled them to breathe, and live under water. Yet every face was\r\nsmiling and serene, even in the presence of their dread master. In\r\nparts of the big hall were groups of other slaves.\r\n\r\nSacho ranged the prisoners in a circle before Zog's throne, and slowly\r\nthe magician turned his eyes, glowing like live coals, upon the four.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"Captives,\" said he, speaking in his clear, sweet voice, \"in our first\r\ninterview you defied me, and both the mermaid queen and the princess\r\ndeclared they could not die. But if that is a true statement, as I\r\nhave yet to discover, there are various ways to make you miserable and\r\nunhappy, and this I propose to do in order to amuse myself at your\r\nexpense. You have been brought here to undergo the first trial of\r\nstrength between us.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ZOG'S SLAVES WERE AS JOLLY AS COULD BE]\r\n\r\nNone of the prisoners replied to this speech, so Zog turned to one of\r\nhis slaves and said:\r\n\r\n\"Rivivi, bring in the Yell-Maker.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nRivivi was a big fellow, brown of skin, and with flashing black eyes.\r\nHe bowed to his master and left the room by an archway covered with\r\nheavy draperies. The next moment these curtains were violently pushed\r\naside and a dreadful sea creature swam into the hall. It had a body\r\nmuch like that of a crab, only more round and of a jet-black color. Its\r\neyes were bright yellow balls set on the ends of two horns that stuck\r\nout of its head. They were cruel looking eyes, too, and seemed able to\r\nsee every person in the room at the same time.\r\n\r\nThe legs of the Yell-Maker, however, were the most curious part of\r\nthe creature. There were six of them, slender and black as coal, and\r\neach extended twelve to fifteen feet from its body, when stretched out\r\nin a straight line. They were hinged in several places, so they could\r\nbe folded up, or extended at will. At the ends of these thin legs\r\nwere immense claws shaped like those of a lobster, and they were real\r\n\"nippers,\" of a most dangerous sort.\r\n\r\nThe prisoners knew, as soon as they saw the awful claws, why the thing\r\nwas called the \"Yell-Maker,\" and Trot gave a little shiver and crept\r\ncloser to Cap'n Bill.\r\n\r\nZog looked with approval upon the creature he had summoned, and said to\r\nit:\r\n\r\n\"I give you four victims--the four people with fish's tails. Let me\r\nhear how loud they can yell.\"\r\n\r\nThe Yell-Maker uttered a grunt of pleasure and in a flash stretched\r\nout one of its long legs toward the queen's nose, where its powerful\r\nclaws came together with a loud snap. Aquareine did not stir; she only\r\nsmiled. Both Zog and the creature that had attacked her seemed much\r\nsurprised to find she was unhurt.\r\n\r\n\"Again!\" cried Zog; and again the Yell-Maker's claw shot out and tried\r\nto pinch the queen's pretty ear. But the magic of the fairy mermaid was\r\nproof against this sea-rascal's strength and swiftness, nor could he\r\ntouch any part of Aquareine, although he tried again and again, roaring\r\nwith anger like a mad bull.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTrot began to enjoy this performance, and as her merry, childish\r\nlaughter rang out the Yell-Maker turned furiously upon the little girl,\r\ntwo of the dreadful claws trying to nip her at the same time. She had\r\nno chance to cry out, or jump backward; yet she remained unharmed. For\r\nthe Fairy Circle of Queen Aquareine kept her safe.\r\n\r\nNow Cap'n Bill was attacked, and Princess Clia as well. The half-dozen\r\nslender legs darted in every direction, like sword thrusts, to reach\r\ntheir victims, and the cruel claws snapped so rapidly that the\r\nsound was like the rattling of castanets. But the four prisoners\r\nregarded their enemy with smiling composure, and no yell greeted the\r\nYell-Maker's efforts.\r\n\r\n\"Enough!\" said Zog, softly and sweetly. \"You may retire, my poor\r\nYell-Maker, for with these people you are powerless.\"\r\n\r\nThe creature paused, and rolled its yellow eyes.\r\n\r\n\"May I nip just one of the slaves, oh, Zog?\" it asked, pleadingly. \"I\r\nhate to leave without pleasing your ears with a single yell.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let my slaves alone,\" was Zog's answer. \"They are here to serve me,\r\nand must not be injured. Go, feeble one!\"\r\n\r\n\"Not so!\" cried the Queen. \"It is a shame, Zog, that such an evil thing\r\nshould exist in our fair sea.\" With this, she drew her fairy wand from\r\na fold of her gown and waved it toward the creature. At once, the\r\nYell-Maker sank down unconscious upon the floor; its legs fell apart\r\nin many pieces, the claws tumbling in a heap beside the body. Then all\r\ngrew withered and lost shape, becoming a pulpy mass, like gelatine.\r\nA few moments later the creature had melted away to nothing at all,\r\nforever disappearing from the ocean where it had caused so much horror\r\nand pain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nZog watched this destruction with surprising patience. When it was all\r\nover he nodded his head and smiled, and Trot noticed that whenever Zog\r\nsmiled his slaves lost their jolly looks and began to tremble.\r\n\r\n\"That is very pretty magic, Aquareine,\" said the monster. \"I, myself,\r\nlearned the trick several thousand years ago, so it does not astonish\r\nme. Have you fairies nothing that is new to show me?\"\r\n\r\n\"We desire only to protect ourselves,\" replied the Queen, with dignity.\r\n\r\n\"Then I will give you a chance to do so,\" said Zog.\r\n\r\nAs he spoke the great marble blocks in the ceiling of the room,\r\ndirectly over the heads of the captives, gave way and came crashing\r\ndown upon them. Many tons of weight were in these marble blocks, and\r\nthe magician had planned to crush his victims where they stood.\r\n\r\nBut the four were still unharmed. The marble, being unable to touch\r\nthem, was diverted from its course, and when the roar of the great\r\ncrash had died away Zog saw his intended victims standing quietly in\r\ntheir places, and smiling scornfully at his weak attempts to destroy\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Chap. 16._\r\n\r\n_The_ TOP OF THE GREAT DOME]\r\n\r\n\r\nCap'n Bill's heart was beating pretty fast, but he did not let Zog know\r\nthat. Trot was so sure of the protection of the fairy mermaids that she\r\nwould not allow herself to become frightened. Aquareine and Clia were\r\nas calm as if nothing had happened.\r\n\r\n\"Please excuse this little interruption,\" said Zog. \"I knew very well\r\nthe marble blocks could not hurt you. But the play is over for a time.\r\nYou may now retire to your rooms, and when I again invite you to my\r\npresence I shall have found some better way to entertain you.\"\r\n\r\nWithout reply to this threat they turned and followed Sacho from the\r\nhall, and the boy led them straight back to their own rooms.\r\n\r\n\"Zog is making a great mistake,\" said Sacho, with a laugh. \"He has no\r\ntime for vengeance, but the great magician does not know that.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is he trying to do, anyway?\" asked Trot.\r\n\r\n\"He does not tell me his secrets, but I've an idea he wants to kill\r\nyou,\" replied Sacho. \"How absurd it is to be plotting such a thing,\r\nwhen he might spend his time in laughing and being jolly! Isn't it,\r\nnow?\"\r\n\r\n\"Zog is a wicked, wicked, creature!\" exclaimed Trot.\r\n\r\n\"But he has his good points,\" replied Sacho, cheerfully. \"There is no\r\none in all the world so bad that there is nothing good about him.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not so sure of that,\" said Cap'n Bill. \"What are Zog's good\r\npoints?\"\r\n\r\n\"All his slaves were saved from drowning, and he is kind to them,\" said\r\nSacho.\r\n\r\n\"That is merely the kindness of selfishness,\" said Aquareine. \"Tell me,\r\nmy lad, is the opening in the great dome outside guarded?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, indeed,\" was the reply. \"You cannot hope to escape in that way,\r\nfor the prince of the sea devils, who is the largest and fiercest of\r\nhis race, lies crouched over the opening, night and day, and none can\r\npass his network of curling legs.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is there no avenue that is not guarded?\" continued Aquareine.\r\n\r\n\"None at all, your Majesty. Zog is always careful to be well guarded,\r\nfor he fears the approach of an enemy. What this enemy can be, to\r\nterrify the powerful magician, I do not know; but Zog is always afraid\r\nand never leaves an entrance unguarded. Besides, it is an enchanted\r\ncastle, you know, and none in the ocean can see it unless Zog wishes\r\nhim to. So it will be very hard for his enemy to find him.\"\r\n\r\n\"We wish to escape,\" said Clia. \"Will you help us, Sacho?\"\r\n\r\n\"In any way I can,\" replied the boy.\r\n\r\n\"If we succeed, we will take you with us,\" continued the Princess. But\r\nSacho shook his head, and laughed.\r\n\r\n\"I would indeed like to see you escape Zog's vengeance,\" said he,\r\n\"for vengeance is wrong and you are too pretty, and too good to be\r\ndestroyed. But I am happy here, and have no wish to go away, having no\r\nother home or friends, other than my fellow slaves.\"\r\n\r\nThen he left them, and when they were again alone, Aquareine said:\r\n\r\n\"We were able to escape Zog's attacks to-day, but I am quite sure he\r\nwill plan more powerful ways to destroy us. He has shown that he knows\r\nsome clever magic and perhaps I shall not be able to foil it. So it\r\nwill be well for us to escape to-night, if possible.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can you fight and conquer the big sea devil up in the dome?\" asked\r\nTrot.\r\n\r\nThe queen was thoughtful, and did not reply to this question at once.\r\nBut Cap'n Bill said, uneasily:\r\n\r\n\"I can't abide them devil critters, an' I hopes, for my part, we won't\r\nbe called on to tackle 'em. You see, Trot, we're in consider'ble of a\r\nbad mess, an' if we ever live to tell the tale--\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not, Cap'n?\" asked the child. \"We're safe enough, so far. Can't\r\nyou trust to our good friend the queen?\"\r\n\r\n\"She don't seem plumb sure o' things herself,\" remarked the sailor.\r\n\"The mermaids is all right an' friendly, mate, but this 'ere magic\r\nmaker--ol' Zog--is a bad one, out 'n' out, an' means to kill us, if he\r\ncan.\"\r\n\r\n\"But he can't!\" cried Trot, bravely.\r\n\r\n\"I hope you're right, dear. I wouldn't want to bet on Zog's chances,\r\njes' yet, an' at the same time it would be riskin' money to bet on our\r\nchances. Seems to me it's a case of luck which wins.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't worry, friend,\" said the Queen. \"I have a plan to save us. Let\r\nus wait patiently until nightfall.\"\r\n\r\nThey waited in the Rose Chamber a long time, talking earnestly\r\ntogether; but the brilliant light that flooded both the room and the\r\ngreat dome outside did not fade in the least.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAfter several hours had passed away the gong sounded and Tom Atto\r\nagain appeared, followed by four slaves bearing many golden dishes upon\r\nsilver trays. The friendly cook had prepared a fine dinner and they\r\nwere all glad to find that, whatever Zog intended to do to them, he\r\nhad no intention of starving them. Perhaps the magician realized that\r\nAquareine's fairy powers, if put to the test, would be able to provide\r\nfood for her companions; but whatever his object may have been, their\r\nenemy had given them splendid rooms and plenty to eat.\r\n\r\n\"Isn't it nearly night time?\" asked the Queen, as Tom Atto spread the\r\ntable with a cloth of woven seaweed and directed his men to place the\r\ndishes upon it.\r\n\r\n\"Night!\" he exclaimed, as if surprised. \"There is no night here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Doesn't it ever get dark?\" inquired Trot.\r\n\r\n\"Never. We know nothing of the passage of time, or of day and night.\r\nThe light always shines just as you see it now, and we sleep whenever\r\nwe are tired and rise again as soon as we are rested.\"\r\n\r\n\"What causes the light?\" Princess Clia asked.\r\n\r\n\"It's magic, your Highness,\" said the cook, solemnly. \"It's one of the\r\ncurious things Zog is able to do. But you must remember all this place\r\nis a big cave, in which the castle stands, so the light is never seen\r\nby anyone, except those who live here.\"\r\n\r\n\"But why does Zog keep his light going all the time?\" asked the Queen.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose it is because he himself never sleeps,\" replied Tom Atto.\r\n\"They say the master hasn't slept for hundreds of years; not since\r\nAnko, the sea serpent, defeated him and drove him into this place.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThey asked no more questions, and began to eat their dinner in silence.\r\nBefore long Cap'n Joe came in to visit his brother, and took a seat at\r\nthe table with the prisoners. He proved a jolly fellow, and when he and\r\nCap'n Bill talked about their boyhood days the stories were so funny\r\nthat everybody laughed, and for a time forgot their worries.\r\n\r\nWhen dinner was over, however, and Cap'n Joe had gone back to his work\r\nof sewing on buttons and the servants had carried away the dishes, the\r\nprisoners remembered their troubles and the fate that awaited them.\r\n\r\n\"I am much disappointed,\" said the Queen, \"to find there is no\r\nnight here, and that Zog never sleeps. It will make our escape more\r\ndifficult. Yet we must make the attempt, and as we are tired and a\r\ngreat struggle is before us, it will be best for us to sleep and\r\nrefresh ourselves.\"\r\n\r\nThey agreed to this, for the day had been long and adventurous, so\r\nCap'n Bill kissed Trot and went into the Peony Room, where he lay down\r\nupon his spongy couch and soon fell fast asleep.\r\n\r\nThe mermaids and Trot followed this example, and I think none of them\r\nwas much worried, after all, because they quickly sank into peaceful\r\nslumber and forgot all the dangers that threatened them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Chap. 17._\r\n\r\n_The_ QUEEN'S GOLDEN SWORD]\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Goodness me!\" exclaimed Trot, raising herself by a flirt of her\r\npink-scaled tail and a wave of her fins; \"isn't it dreadful hot here?\"\r\n\r\nThe mermaids had risen at the same time, and Cap'n Bill came swimming\r\nin from the Peony Room in time to hear the little girl's speech.\r\n\r\n\"Hot!\" echoed the sailor, \"why, I feel like the inside of a steam\r\nengine!\"\r\n\r\nThe perspiration was rolling down his round, red face, and he took\r\nout his handkerchief and carefully wiped it away, waving his fishtail\r\ngently at the same time.\r\n\r\n\"What we need most in this room,\" said he, \"is a fan.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's the trouble, do you s'pose?\" inquired Trot.\r\n\r\n\"It is another trick of the monster Zog,\" answered the Queen, calmly.\r\n\"He has made the water in our rooms boiling hot, and if it could touch\r\nus we would be well cooked by this time. Even as it is, we are all made\r\nuncomfortable by breathing the heated air.\"\r\n\r\n\"What shall we do, ma'am?\" the sailorman asked, with a groan. \"I\r\nexpected to get into hot water afore we've done with this foolishness,\r\nbut I don't like the feel o' bein' par-boiled, jes' the same.\"\r\n\r\nThe queen was waving her fairy wand, and paid no attention to Cap'n\r\nBill's moans. Already, the water felt cooler and they began to breathe\r\nmore easily. In a few moments more the heat had passed from the\r\nsurrounding water altogether, and all danger from this source was over.\r\n\r\n\"This is better,\" said Trot, gratefully.\r\n\r\n\"Do you care to sleep again?\" asked the Queen.\r\n\r\n\"No; I'm wide awake, now,\" answered the child.\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid if I goes to sleep ag'in I'll wake up a pot roast,\" said\r\nCap'n Bill.\r\n\r\n\"Let us consider ways to escape,\" suggested Clia. \"It seems useless for\r\nus to remain here, quietly, until Zog discovers a way to destroy us.\"\r\n\r\n\"But we must not blunder,\" added Aquareine, cautiously. \"To fail in our\r\nattempt would be to acknowledge Zog's superior power, so we must think\r\nwell upon our plan before we begin to carry it out. What do you advise,\r\nsir?\" she asked, turning to Cap'n Bill.\r\n\r\n\"My opinion, ma'am, is that the only way for us to escape is to get\r\nout o' here,\" was the sailor's vague answer. \"How to do it is your\r\nbusiness, seein' as I ain't no fairy myself, either in looks or in\r\neddication.\"\r\n\r\nThe queen smiled, and said to Trot:\r\n\r\n\"What is your opinion, my dear?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think we might swim out the same way we came in,\" answered the\r\nchild. \"If we could get Sacho to lead us back through the maze, we\r\nwould follow that long tunnel to the open ocean, and--\"\r\n\r\n\"And there would be the sea devils waitin' for us,\" added Cap'n Bill,\r\nwith a shake of his bald head. \"They'd drive us back inter the tunnel,\r\nlike they did the first time, Trot. It won't do, mate; it won't do.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you a suggestion, Clia?\" inquired the Queen.\r\n\r\n\"I have thought of an undertaking,\" replied the pretty princess; \"but\r\nit is a bold plan, your Majesty, and you may not care to risk it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us hear it, anyway,\" said Aquareine, encouragingly.\r\n\r\n\"It is to destroy Zog himself, and put him out of the world forever.\r\nThen we would be free to go home, whenever we pleased.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can you suggest a way to destroy Zog?\" asked Aquareine.\r\n\r\n\"No, your Majesty,\" Clia answered. \"I must leave the way for you to\r\ndetermine.\"\r\n\r\n\"In the old days,\" said the Queen, thoughtfully, \"the mighty King Anko\r\ncould not destroy this monster. He succeeded in defeating Zog, and\r\ndrove him into this great cavern; but even Anko could not destroy him.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have heard the sea serpent explain that it was because he could not\r\nreach the magician,\" returned Clia. \"If King Anko could have seized Zog\r\nin his coils he would have made an end of the wicked monster quickly.\r\nZog knows this, and that is why he does not dare to venture forth from\r\nhis retreat. Anko is the enemy he constantly dreads. But with you, my\r\nqueen, the case is different. You may easily reach Zog, and the only\r\nquestion is whether your power is sufficient to destroy him.\"\r\n\r\nFor a while, Aquareine remained silent.\r\n\r\n\"I am not sure of my power over Zog,\" she said at last, \"and for that\r\nreason I hesitate to attack him personally. His slaves, and his allies\r\nthe sea devils, I can easily conquer; so I prefer to find a way to\r\novercome the guards at the entrances, rather than to encounter their\r\nterrible master. But even the guards have been given strength and power\r\nby the magician, as we have already discovered; so I must procure a\r\nweapon with which to fight them.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"A weapon, ma'am?\" said Cap'n Bill; and then he took a jackknife from\r\nhis coat pocket and opened the big blade, afterward handing it to the\r\nqueen. \"That ain't a bad weapon,\" he announced.\r\n\r\n\"But it is useless in this case,\" she replied, smiling at the old\r\nsailor's earnestness. \"For my purpose I must have a golden sword.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, there's plenty of gold around this castle,\" said Trot, looking\r\naround her. \"Even in this room there's enough to make a hundred golden\r\nswords.\"\r\n\r\n\"But we can't melt or forge gold under water, mate,\" the Cap'n said.\r\n\r\n\"Why not? Don't you s'pose all these gold roses and things were made\r\nunder water?\" asked the little girl.\r\n\r\n\"Like enough,\" admitted the sailor; \"but I don't see how.\"\r\n\r\nJust then, the gong at their door sounded and the boy Sacho came in,\r\nsmiling and cheerful as ever. He said Zog had sent him to inquire after\r\ntheir health and happiness.\r\n\r\n\"You may tell him that his water became a trifle too warm, so we cooled\r\nit,\" replied the Queen. Then they told Sacho how the boiling water had\r\nmade them uncomfortable while they slept.\r\n\r\nSacho whistled a little tune, and seemed thoughtful.\r\n\r\n\"Zog is foolish,\" said he. \"How often have I told him that vengeance\r\nis but a waste of time. He is worried to know how to destroy you, and\r\nthat is wasting more time. You are worried for fear he will injure you,\r\nand so you also are wasting time. My, my! what a waste of time is going\r\non in this castle!\"\r\n\r\n\"Seems to me that we have so much time it doesn't matter,\" said Trot.\r\n\"What's time for, anyhow?\"\r\n\r\n\"Time is given us to be happy, and for no other reason,\" replied the\r\nboy, soberly. \"When we waste time, we waste happiness. But there is no\r\ntime for preaching, so I'll go.\"\r\n\r\n\"Please wait a moment, Sacho,\" said the Queen.\r\n\r\n\"Can I do anything to make you happy?\" he asked, smiling again.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" answered Aquareine. \"We are curious to know who does all this\r\nbeautiful gold work and ornamentation.\"\r\n\r\n\"Some of the slaves here are goldsmiths, having been taught by Zog to\r\nforge and work metal under water,\" explained Sacho. \"In parts of the\r\nocean lie many rocks filled with veins of pure gold and golden nuggets,\r\nand we get large supplies from sunken ships, as well. There is no\r\nlack of gold here, but it is not as precious as it is upon the earth,\r\nbecause here we have no need of money.\"\r\n\r\n\"We would like to see the goldsmiths at work,\" announced the Queen.\r\n\r\nThe boy hesitated a moment. Then he said:\r\n\r\n\"I will take you to their room, where you may watch them for a time. I\r\nwill not ask Zog's permission to do this, for he might refuse. But my\r\norders were to allow you the liberty of the castle, and so I will let\r\nyou see the goldsmiths' shop.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you,\" replied Aquareine, quietly; and then the four followed\r\nSacho along various corridors until they came to a large room, where a\r\ndozen men were busily at work. The shop was flooded with the brilliant,\r\nunknown light. Lying here and there were heaps of virgin gold, some\r\nin its natural state and some already fashioned into ornaments and\r\nfurniture of various sorts. Each man worked at a bench where there was\r\na curious iron furnace in which glowed a vivid, white light. Although\r\nthis workshop was all under water, and the workmen were obliged to\r\nbreathe as fishes do, the furnaces glowed so hot that the water\r\ntouching them was turned into steam. Gold, or other metal, held over a\r\nfurnace quickly softened or melted, when it could be forged or molded\r\ninto any shape desired.\r\n\r\n\"The furnaces are electric,\" explained Sacho, \"and heat as well under\r\nwater as they would in the open air. Let me introduce you to the\r\nforeman, who will tell you of his work better than I can.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe foreman was a slave named Agga-Groo, who was lean and lank, and had\r\nan expression more surly and unhappy than any slave they had yet seen.\r\nYet he seemed willing to leave his work and explain to the visitors how\r\nhe made so many beautiful things out of gold, for he took much pride\r\nin this labor and knew its artistic worth. Moreover, since he had been\r\nin Zog's castle, these were the first strangers to enter his workshop,\r\nso he welcomed them in his own gruff way.\r\n\r\nThe queen asked him if he was happy, and he shook his head and replied:\r\n\r\n\"It isn't like Calcutta, where I used to work in gold before I was\r\nwrecked at sea, and nearly drowned. Zog rescued me and brought me here\r\na slave. It is a stupid life we lead, doing the same things over and\r\nover every day; but perhaps it is better than being dead. I'm not sure.\r\nThe only pleasure I get in life is in creating pretty things out of\r\ngold.\"\r\n\r\n\"Could you forge me a golden sword?\" asked the Queen, smiling sweetly\r\nupon the goldsmith.\r\n\r\n\"I could, madam; but I won't unless Zog orders me to do it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you like Zog better than you do me?\" inquired Aquareine.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" was the answer. \"I hate Zog.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then won't you make the sword to please me--and to show your skill?\"\r\npleaded the pretty mermaid.\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid of my master. He might not like it,\" the man replied.\r\n\r\n\"But he will never know,\" said Princess Clia.\r\n\r\n\"You cannot say what Zog knows; or what he doesn't know,\" growled the\r\nman. \"I can't take chances of offending Zog, for I must live with him\r\nalways as a slave.\"\r\n\r\nWith this he turned away and resumed his work, hammering the leaf of a\r\ngolden tulip.\r\n\r\nCap'n Bill had listened carefully to this conversation, and being a\r\nwise old sailor, in his way, he thought he understood the nature of\r\nold Agga-Groo better than the mermaids did. So he went close to the\r\ngoldsmith, and feeling in the pockets of his coat drew out a silver\r\ncompass, shaped like a watch.\r\n\r\n\"I'll give you this, if you'll make the queen the golden sword,\" he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nAgga-Groo looked at the compass with interest, and tested its power of\r\npointing north. Then he shook his head, and handed it back to Cap'n\r\nBill.\r\n\r\nThe sailor dived into his pocket again and pulled out a pair of\r\nscissors, which he placed beside the compass on the palm of his big\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n\"You may have them both,\" he said.\r\n\r\nAgga-Groo hesitated, for he wanted the scissors badly; but finally\r\nhe shook his head again. Cap'n Bill added a piece of cord, an iron\r\nthimble, some fishhooks, four buttons, and a safety pin; but, still the\r\ngoldsmith would not be tempted. So, with a sigh, the sailor brought out\r\nhis fine, big jackknife, and at sight of this Agga-Groo's eyes began\r\nto sparkle. Steel was not to be had at the bottom of the sea, although\r\ngold was so plentiful.\r\n\r\n\"All right, friend,\" he said; \"give me that lot of trinkets and I'll\r\nmake you a pretty gold sword. But it won't be any good except to look\r\nat, for our gold is so pure that it is very soft.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind that,\" replied Cap'n Bill. \"All we want is the sword.\"\r\n\r\nThe goldsmith set to work at once, and so skillful was he that in a few\r\nminutes he had forged a fine sword of yellow gold, with an ornamental\r\nhandle. The shape was graceful, and the blade keen and slender.\r\n\r\nIt was evident to them all that the golden sword would not stand hard\r\nuse, for the edge of the blade would nick and curl like lead; but the\r\nqueen was delighted with the prize, and took it eagerly in her hand.\r\n\r\nJust then Sacho returned to say that they must go back to their\r\nrooms, and after thanking the goldsmith, who was so busy examining\r\nhis newly-acquired treasures that he made no response, they joyfully\r\nfollowed the boy back to the Rose Chamber.\r\n\r\nSacho told them that he had just come from Zog, who was still wasting\r\ntime in plotting vengeance.\r\n\r\n\"You must be careful,\" he advised them, \"for my cruel master intends\r\nto stop you from living, and he may succeed. Don't be unhappy; but\r\nbe careful. Zog is angry because you escaped his Yell-Maker, and the\r\nfalling stones, and the hot water. While he is angry he is wasting\r\ntime; but that will not help you. Take care not to waste any time\r\nyourselves.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"Do you know what Zog intends to do to us next?\" asked Princess Clia.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Sacho; \"but it is reasonable to guess that, being evil, he\r\nintends evil. He never intends to do good, I assure you.\"\r\n\r\nThen the boy went away.\r\n\r\n\"I am no longer afraid,\" declared the Mermaid Queen, when they were\r\nalone. \"When I have bestowed certain fairy powers upon this golden\r\nsword, it will fight its way against any who dare oppose us, and even\r\nZog himself will not care to face so powerful a weapon. I am now able\r\nto promise you that we shall make our escape.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good!\" cried Trot, joyfully. \"Shall we start now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not yet, my dear. It will take me a little while to charm this golden\r\nblade so that it will obey my commands, and do my work. There is no\r\nneed of undue haste, so I propose we all sleep for a time and obtain\r\nwhat rest we can. We must be fresh and ready for our great adventure.\"\r\n\r\nAs their former nap had been interrupted, they readily agreed to\r\nAquareine's proposal and at once went to their couches and composed\r\nthemselves to slumber. When they were asleep the fairy mermaid charmed\r\nher golden sword, and then she also lay down to rest herself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Chap. 18._\r\n\r\nA DASH FOR LIBERTY]\r\n\r\n\r\nTrot dreamed that she was at home in her own bed; but the night seemed\r\nchilly and she wanted to draw the coverlet up to her chin. She was\r\nnot wide awake, but realized that she was cold and was unable to move\r\nher arms to cover herself up. She tried, but could not stir. Then she\r\nroused herself a little more, and tried again. Yes; it was cold--very\r\ncold! Really, she _must_ do something to get warm, she thought. She\r\nopened her eyes, and stared at a great wall of ice in front of her.\r\n\r\nShe was awake now, and frightened, too. But, she could not move because\r\nthe ice was all around her. She was frozen inside of it, and the air\r\nspace around her was not big enough to allow her to turn over.\r\n\r\nAt once, the little girl realized what had happened. Their wicked enemy\r\nZog had, by his magic art, frozen all the water in their room while\r\nthey slept, and now they were all imprisoned and helpless. Trot and\r\nCap'n Bill were sure to freeze to death in a short time, for only a\r\ntiny air space remained between their bodies and the ice, and this air\r\nwas like that of a winter day when the thermometer is below zero.\r\n\r\nAcross the room Trot could see the mermaid queen lying on her couch,\r\nfor the solid ice was clear as crystal. Aquareine was imprisoned just\r\nas Trot was, and although she held her fairy wand in one hand and the\r\ngolden sword in the other, she seemed unable to move either of them,\r\nand the girl remembered that the queen always waved her magic wand to\r\naccomplish anything. Princess Clia's couch was behind that of Trot,\r\nso the child could not see her; and Cap'n Bill was in his own room,\r\nprobably frozen fast in the ice, as the others were.\r\n\r\nThe terrible Zog had surely been very clever in this last attempt to\r\ndestroy them. Trot thought it all over, and decided that, inasmuch as\r\nthe queen was unable to wave her fairy wand, she could do nothing to\r\nrelease herself or her friends.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: QUEEN AQUAREINE AND THE MAGIC SWORD]\r\n\r\nBut in this the girl was mistaken. The fairy mermaid was even now at\r\nwork, trying to save them, and in a few minutes Trot was astonished and\r\ndelighted to see the queen rise from her couch. She could not go far\r\nfrom it, at first, but the ice was melting rapidly all around her;\r\nso that gradually Aquareine approached the place where the child lay.\r\nTrot could hear the mermaid's voice sounding through the ice, as if\r\nfrom afar off; but it grew more distinct until she could make out that\r\nthe queen was saying: \"Courage, friends! Do not despair, for soon you\r\nwill be free.\"\r\n\r\nBefore very long the ice between Trot and the queen had melted away\r\nentirely, and with a cry of joy the little girl flopped her pink tail\r\nand swam to the side of her deliverer.\r\n\r\n\"Are you very cold?\" asked Aquareine.\r\n\r\n\"N--not v--v--very!\" replied Trot; but, her teeth chattered and she was\r\nstill shivering.\r\n\r\n\"The water will be warm in a few minutes,\" said the Queen. \"But now I\r\nmust melt the rest of the ice and liberate Clia.\"\r\n\r\nThis she did in an astonishingly brief time, and the pretty princess,\r\nbeing herself a fairy, had not been at all affected by the cold\r\nsurrounding her.\r\n\r\nThey now swam to the door of Cap'n Bill's room and found the Peony\r\nChamber a solid block of ice. The queen worked her magic power as hard\r\nas she could, and the ice thawed and melted quickly before her fairy\r\nwand. Yet when they reached the old sailor he was almost frozen stiff,\r\nand Trot and Clia had to rub his hands and nose, and ears very briskly\r\nto warm him up, and bring him back to life.\r\n\r\nCap'n Bill was pretty tough, and he came around in time and opened his\r\neyes and sneezed, and asked if the blizzard was over. So the queen\r\nwaved her wand over his head a few times to restore him to his natural\r\ncondition of warmth, and soon the old sailor became quite comfortable\r\nand was able to understand all about the strange adventure from which\r\nhe had so marvelously escaped.\r\n\r\n\"I've made up my mind to one thing, Trot,\" he said confidentially; \"if\r\never I get out o' this mess I'm in, I won't be an Arctic explorer,\r\nwhatever else happens. Shivers an' shakes ain't to my likin', an' this\r\nice business ain't what it's sometimes cracked up to be. To be friz\r\nonce is enough fer anybody, an' if I was a gal like you I wouldn't even\r\nwear frizzes on my hair.\"\r\n\r\n\"You haven't any hair, Cap'n Bill,\" answered Trot; \"so you needn't\r\nworry.\"\r\n\r\nThe queen and Clia had been talking together very earnestly. They now\r\napproached their earth friends, and Aquareine said:\r\n\r\n\"We have decided not to remain in this castle any longer. Zog's cruel\r\ndesigns upon our lives and happiness are becoming too dangerous for us\r\nto endure. The golden sword now bears a fairy charm, and by its aid I\r\nwill cut a way through our enemies. Are you ready and willing to follow\r\nme?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course we are!\" cried Trot.\r\n\r\n\"It don't seem 'zactly right to ask a lady to do the fightin',\"\r\nremarked Cap'n Bill; \"but magic ain't my strong p'int, and it seems to\r\nbe yours, ma'am. So swim ahead, and we'll wiggle the same way you do,\r\nan' try to wiggle out of our troubles.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"If I chance to fail,\" said the Queen, \"try not to blame me. I will do\r\nall in my power to provide for our escape, and I am willing to risk\r\neverything, because I well know that to remain here will mean to perish\r\nin the end.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's all right,\" said Trot, with fine courage. \"Let's have it over\r\nwith.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then we will leave here at once,\" said Aquareine.\r\n\r\nShe approached the window of the room, and with one blow of her golden\r\nsword shattered the thick pane of glass. The opening thus made was\r\nlarge enough for them to swim through, if they were careful not to\r\nscrape against the broken points of glass. The queen went first,\r\nfollowed by Trot and Cap'n Bill, with Clia last of all.\r\n\r\nAnd now they were in the vast dome in which the castle and gardens of\r\nZog had been built. Around them was a clear stretch of water, and far\r\nabove--full half a mile distant--was the opening in the roof guarded by\r\nthe prince of the sea devils.\r\n\r\nThe mermaid queen had determined to attack this monster. If she\r\nsucceeded in destroying it with her golden sword the little band of\r\nfugitives might then swim through the opening into the clear waters\r\nof the ocean. Although this prince of the sea devils was said to be\r\nbig and wise and mighty, there was but one of him to fight; whereas,\r\nif they attempted to escape through any of the passages, they must\r\nencounter scores of such enemies.\r\n\r\n\"Swim straight for the opening in the dome!\" cried Aquareine, and in\r\nanswer to the command the four whisked their glittering tails, waved\r\ntheir fins, and shot away through the water at full speed; their course\r\nslanting upward toward the top of the dome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Chap. 19._\r\n\r\nKING ANKO TO THE RESCUE]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe great magician Zog never slept. He was always watchful and alert.\r\nSome strange power warned him that his prisoners were about to escape.\r\n\r\nScarcely had the four left the castle by the broken window when the\r\nmonster stepped from a doorway below and saw them. Instantly he blew\r\nupon a golden whistle, and at the summons a band of wolf-fish appeared\r\nand dashed after the prisoners. These creatures swam so swiftly that\r\nsoon they were between the fugitives and the dome, and then they turned\r\nand with wicked eyes and sharp fangs began a fierce attack upon the\r\nmermaids and the earth dwellers.\r\n\r\nTrot was a little frightened at the evil looks of the sea wolves,\r\nwhose heads were enormous, and whose jaws contained rows of curved and\r\npointed teeth. But, Aquareine advanced upon them with her golden sword\r\nand every touch of the charmed weapon instantly killed an enemy; so,\r\nthat one by one the wolf-fish rolled over upon their backs and sank\r\nhelplessly downward through the water, leaving the prisoners free to\r\ncontinue their way toward the opening in the dome.\r\n\r\nZog witnessed the destruction of his wolves and uttered a loud laugh\r\nthat was terrible to hear. Then the dread monster determined to arrest\r\nthe fugitives himself, and in order to do this he was forced to\r\ndiscover himself in all the horror of his awful form--a form he was\r\nso ashamed of and loathed so greatly that he always strove to keep\r\nit concealed, even from his own eyes. But it was important that his\r\nprisoners should not escape.\r\n\r\nHastily casting off the folds of the robe that enveloped him Zog\r\nallowed his body to uncoil and shoot upward through the water, in swift\r\npursuit of his victims. His cloven hoofs, upon which he usually walked,\r\nbeing now useless, were drawn up under him, while coil after coil of\r\nhis eel-like body wriggled away like a serpent. At his shoulders two\r\nbroad feathery wings expanded, and these enabled the monster to cleave\r\nhis way through the water with terrific force.\r\n\r\nZog was part man, part beast, part fish, part fowl, and part reptile.\r\nHis undulating body was broad and thin, and like the body of an eel. It\r\nwas as repulsive as one could well imagine, and no wonder Zog hated\r\nit and kept it covered with his robe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nNow, with his horned head and its glowing eyes thrust forward, wings\r\nflapping from his shoulders and his eely body--ending in a fish's\r\ntail--wriggling far behind him, this strange and evil creature was\r\na thing of terror, even to the sea dwellers, who were accustomed to\r\nremarkable sights.\r\n\r\nThe mermaids, the sailor and the child, one after another looking back\r\nas they swam onward toward liberty and safety, saw the monster coming\r\nand shuddered with uncontrollable fear. They were drawing nearer to\r\nthe dome by this time, yet it was still some distance away. The four\r\nredoubled their speed, darting through the water with the swiftness\r\nof sky-rockets. But fast as they swam, Zog swam faster, and the good\r\nqueen's heart began to throb as she realized she would be forced to\r\nfight her loathesome foe.\r\n\r\nPresently Zog's long body was circling round them like a whirlwind,\r\nlashing the water into foam and gradually drawing nearer and nearer to\r\nhis victims. His eyes were no longer glowing coals--they were balls of\r\nflame--and as he circled around them, he laughed aloud that horrible\r\nlaugh which was far more terrifying than any cry of rage could be.\r\n\r\nThe queen struck out with her golden sword, but Zog wrapped a coil of\r\nhis thin body around it and, wresting it from her hand, crushed the\r\nweapon into a shapeless mass. Then, Aquareine waved her fairy wand;\r\nbut, in a flash the monster sent it flying away through the water.\r\n\r\nCap'n Bill now decided that they were lost. He drew Trot closer to his\r\nside and placed one arm around her.\r\n\r\n\"I can't save you, dear little mate,\" he said, sadly, \"but we've lived\r\na long time together, an' now we'll die together. I knew, Trot, when\r\nfirst we sawr them mermaids, as we'd--we'd--\"\r\n\r\n\"Never live to tell the tale,\" said the child. \"But never mind, Cap'n\r\nBill; we've done the best we could, and we've had a fine time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Forgive me! oh, forgive me!\" cried Aquareine, despairingly. \"I tried\r\nto save you, my poor friends, but--\"\r\n\r\n\"What's that?\" exclaimed the Princess, pointing upward.\r\n\r\nThey all looked past Zog's whirling body, which was slowly enveloping\r\nthem in its folds, toward the round opening in the dome. A dark object\r\nhad appeared there, sliding downward like a huge rope and descending\r\ntoward them with lightning rapidly. They gave a great gasp as they\r\nrecognized the countenance of King Anko, the sea serpent, its gray hair\r\nand whiskers bristling like those of an angry cat and the usually mild\r\nblue eyes glowing with a ferocity even more terrifying than the orbs of\r\nZog.\r\n\r\nThe magician gave a shrill scream at sight of his dreaded enemy, and\r\nabandoning his intended victims Zog made a quick dash to escape. But\r\nnothing in the sea could equal the strength and quickness of King Anko\r\nwhen he was roused. In a flash the sea serpent had caught Zog fast in\r\nhis coils, and his mighty body swept round the monster and imprisoned\r\nhim tightly.\r\n\r\nThe four, so suddenly rescued, swam away to a safer distance from the\r\nstruggle, and then they turned to watch the encounter between the two\r\ngreat opposing powers of the ocean's depths. Yet there was no desperate\r\nfight to observe, for the combatants were unequal. The end came before\r\nthey were aware of it. Zog had been taken by surprise and his great\r\nfear of Anko destroyed all of his magic power. When the sea serpent\r\nslowly released those awful coils, a mass of jelly-like pulp floated\r\ndownward through the water, with no remnant of life remaining in it--no\r\nform to show it had once been Zog, the Magician.\r\n\r\nThen Anko shook his body, that the water might cleanse it, and advanced\r\nhis head toward the group of four whom he had so opportunely rescued.\r\n\r\n\"It is all over, friends,\" said he in his gentle tones, while a mild\r\nexpression once more reigned on his comical features; \"you may go home\r\nat any time you please, for the way through the dome will be open as\r\nsoon as I get my own body through it.\"\r\n\r\nIndeed, so amazing was the length of the great sea serpent, that only\r\na part of him had descended through the hole into the dome. Without\r\nwaiting for the thanks of those he had rescued he swiftly retreated to\r\nthe ocean above, and with grateful hearts they followed him, glad to\r\nleave the cavern where they had endured so much anxiety and danger.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Chap. 20._\r\n\r\nTHE HOME OF THE OCEAN MONARCH]\r\n\r\n\r\nTrot sobbed quietly, with her head on Cap'n Bill's shoulder. She had\r\nbeen a brave little girl during the trying times they had experienced,\r\nand never once had she given way to tears, however desperate their\r\nfate had seemed to be. But now that the one enemy in all the sea to be\r\ndreaded was utterly destroyed, and all dangers were past, the reaction\r\nwas so great that she could not help having \"just one good cry,\" as she\r\nnaively expressed it.\r\n\r\nCap'n Bill was a big sailorman, hardened by age and many adventures;\r\nbut even he felt a \"lump in his throat\" that he could not swallow, try\r\nas hard as he might. Cap'n Bill was glad. He was mostly glad on Trot's\r\naccount, for he loved his sweet, childish companion very dearly, and\r\ndid not want any harm to befall her.\r\n\r\nThey were now in the wide, open sea, with liberty to go wherever they\r\nwished, and if Cap'n Bill could have \"had his say\" he would have gone\r\nstraight home and carried Trot to her mother. But the mermaids must be\r\nconsidered. Aquareine and Clia had been true and faithful friends to\r\ntheir earth guests while dangers were threatening, and it would not be\r\nvery gracious to leave them at once. Moreover, King Anko was now with\r\nthem, his big head keeping pace with the mermaids as they swam, and\r\nthis mighty preserver had a distinct claim upon both Trot and Cap'n\r\nBill. The sailor felt that it would not be polite to ask to go home so\r\nsoon.\r\n\r\n\"If you people had come to visit me, as I invited you to do,\" said the\r\nSea Serpent, \"all this bother and trouble would have been saved. I had\r\nmy palace all put in order to receive the earth dwellers, and sat in my\r\nden waiting patiently to receive you. Yet you never came at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"That reminds me,\" said Trot, drying her eyes; \"you never told us about\r\nthat third pain you once had.\"\r\n\r\n\"Finally,\" continued Anko, \"I sent to inquire as to what had become of\r\nyou, and Merla said you had been gone from the palace a long time, and\r\nshe was getting anxious about you. Then I made inquiries. Every one in\r\nthe sea loves to serve me--except those sea devils and their cousins\r\nthe octopi--and it wasn't long before I heard you had been captured by\r\nZog.\"\r\n\r\n\"Was the third pain as bad as the other two?\" asked Trot.\r\n\r\n\"Naturally, this news disturbed me and made me unhappy,\" said Anko;\r\n\"for I well knew, my Aquareine, that the magician's evil powers were\r\ngreater than your own fairy accomplishments. But I had never been able\r\nto find Zog's enchanted castle, and so I was at a loss to know how to\r\nsave you from your dreadful fate. After I had wasted a good deal of\r\ntime thinking it over, I decided that if the sea devils were slaves of\r\nZog, the prince of the sea devils must know where the enchanted castle\r\nwas located.\r\n\r\n\"I knew this prince, and where to find him, for he always lay on a\r\nhollow rock, on the bottom of the sea, and never moved from that\r\nposition. His people brought food to him and took his commands. So I\r\nhad no trouble in finding this evil prince, and I went to him and asked\r\nthe way to Zog's castle. Of course he would not tell me. He was even\r\ncross and disrespectful--just as I had expected him to be; so I allowed\r\nmyself to become angry and killed him, thinking he was much better dead\r\nthan alive. But after the sea devil was destroyed, what was my surprise\r\nto find that all these years he had been lying over a round hole in the\r\nrock, and covering it with his scarlet body!\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"A light shone through this hole, so I thrust my head in and found a\r\ngreat domed cave underneath, with a splendid silver castle built at\r\nthe bottom. You, my friends, were at that moment swimming toward me as\r\nfast as you could come, and the monster, Zog, my enemy for centuries\r\npast, was close behind you.\r\n\r\n\"Well, the rest of the story you know. I would be angry with all of\r\nyou for so carelessly getting captured, had the incident not led to\r\nthe destruction of the one evil genius in all my ocean. I shall rest\r\neasier and be much happier, now that Zog is dead. He has defied me for\r\nhundreds of years.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, about that third pain,\" said Trot. \"If you don't tell us now, I'm\r\nafraid that I'll forget to ask you.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you should happen to forget, just remind me of it,\" said Anko, \"and\r\nI'll be sure to tell you.\"\r\n\r\nWhile Trot was thinking this over the swimmers drew near to a great\r\ncircular palace made all of solid alabaster, polished as smooth as\r\nivory. Its roof was a vast dome, for domes seemed to be fashionable in\r\nthe ocean houses. There were no doors or windows, but instead of these\r\nseveral round holes appeared in different parts of the dome, some being\r\nhigh up and some low down, and some in between. Out of one of these\r\nholes, which it just fitted, stretched the long, brown body of the sea\r\nserpent. Trot, being astonished at this sight, asked:\r\n\r\n\"Didn't you take all of you when you went to the cavern, Anko?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nearly all, my dear,\" was the reply, accompanied by a cheerful smile,\r\nfor Anko was proud of his great length; \"but not quite all. Some of\r\nme remained, as usual, to keep house while my head was away. But, I've\r\nbeen coiling up ever since we started back, and you will soon be able\r\nto see every inch of me, all together.\"\r\n\r\nEven as he spoke his head slid into the round hole and, at a signal\r\nfrom Aquareine, they all paused outside and waited.\r\n\r\nPresently, there came to them four beautiful winged fishes with faces\r\nlike doll babies. Their long hair and eyelashes were of a purple color,\r\nand their cheeks had rosy spots that looked as if they had been painted\r\nupon them.\r\n\r\n\"His Majesty bids you welcome,\" said one of the doll fishes, in a sweet\r\nvoice. \"Be kind enough to enter the royal palace and our ocean monarch\r\nwill graciously receive you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Seems to me,\" said Trot to the queen, \"these things are putting on\r\nairs. Perhaps they don't know we're friends of Anko.\"\r\n\r\n\"The king insists on certain formalities when anyone visits him,\" was\r\nAquareine's reply. \"It is right that his dignity should be maintained.\"\r\n\r\nThey followed their winged conductors to one of the upper openings, and\r\nas they entered it, Aquareine said in a clear voice: \"May the glory and\r\npower of the ocean king continue forever!\"\r\n\r\nThen she touched the palm of her hand to her forehead in token of\r\nallegiance, and Clia did the same; so Cap'n Bill and Trot followed\r\nsuit. The brief ceremony being ended the child looked curiously around\r\nto see what the palace of the mighty Anko was like.\r\n\r\nAn extensive hall, lined with alabaster, was before them. In the\r\nfloor were five of the round holes. Upon the walls were engraved many\r\ninteresting scenes of ocean life, all chiseled very artistically by\r\nthe tusks of walruses, who, Trot was afterward informed, are greatly\r\nskilled in such work. A few handsome rugs of woven sea grasses were\r\nspread upon the floor; but otherwise the vast hall was bare of\r\nfurniture.\r\n\r\nThe doll-faced fishes escorted them to an upper room where a table was\r\nset, and here the travelers were invited to refresh themselves. As all\r\nfour were exceedingly hungry they welcomed the repast, which was served\r\nby an army of lobsters in royal purple aprons and caps.\r\n\r\nThe meal being finished they again descended to the hall, which seemed\r\nto occupy all the middle of the building. And now their conductors said:\r\n\r\n\"His Majesty is ready to receive you in his den.\"\r\n\r\nThey swam downward through one of the round holes in the floor and\r\nfound themselves in a brilliantly lighted chamber, which appeared\r\nbigger than all the rest of the palace put together. In the center was\r\nthe quaint head of King Anko, and around it was spread a great coverlet\r\nof purple and gold woven together. This concealed all of his body and\r\nstretched from wall to wall of the circular room.\r\n\r\n\"Welcome, friends!\" said Anko, pleasantly. \"How do you like my home?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's very grand,\" replied Trot.\r\n\r\n\"Just the place for a sea serpent, seems to me,\" said Cap'n Bill.\r\n\r\n\"I'm glad you admire it,\" said the King. \"Perhaps I ought to tell you\r\nthat from this day you four belong to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"How's that?\" asked the girl, surprised.\r\n\r\n\"It is a law of the ocean,\" declared Anko, \"that whoever saves\r\nany living creature from violent death owns that creature forever\r\nafterward--while life lasts. You will realize how just this law is when\r\nyou remember that had I not saved you from Zog, you would now be dead.\r\nThe law was suggested by Captain Kid Glove, when he once visited me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean Captain Kidd?\" asked Trot, \"because, if you do--\"\r\n\r\n\"Give him his full name,\" said Anko. \"Captain Kid Glove was--\"\r\n\r\n\"There's no glove to it,\" protested Trot. \"I ought to know, 'cause I've\r\nread about him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Didn't it say anything about a glove?\" asked Anko.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing at all. It jus' called him Cap'n Kidd,\" replied Trot.\r\n\r\n\"She's right, ol' man,\" added Cap'n Bill.\r\n\r\n\"Books,\" said the Sea Serpent, \"are good enough, as far as they go; but\r\nit seems to me your earth books don't go far enough. Captain Kid Glove\r\nwas a gentleman pirate--a kid-glove pirate. To leave off the glove and\r\ncall him just Kidd is very disrespectful.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! you told me to remind you of that third pain,\" said the little\r\ngirl.\r\n\r\n\"Which proves my friendship for you,\" returned the Sea Serpent,\r\nblinking his blue eyes thoughtfully. \"No one likes to be reminded of a\r\npain, and that third pain was--was--\"\r\n\r\n\"What was it?\" asked Trot.\r\n\r\n\"It was a stomach ache,\" replied the King, with a sigh.\r\n\r\n\"What made it?\" she inquired.\r\n\r\n\"Just my carelessness,\" said Anko. \"I'd been away to foreign parts,\r\nseeing how the earth people were getting along. I found the Germans\r\ndancing the german, and the Dutch making dutch cheese, and the Belgians\r\ncombing their belgian hares, and the Turks eating turkey, and the\r\nSardinians sardonically pickling sardines. Then I called on the Prince\r\nof Whales, and--\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean the Prince of Wales,\" corrected Trot.\r\n\r\n\"I mean what I say, my dear. I saw the battlefield where the Bull Run\r\nbut the Americans didn't, and when I got to France I paid a napoleon\r\nto see Napoleon with his bones apart. He was--\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course, you mean--\" Trot was beginning, but the king would not give\r\nher a chance to correct him this time.\r\n\r\n\"He was very hungry for Hungary,\" he continued, \"and was Russian so\r\nfast toward the Poles that I thought he'd discover them. So, as I was\r\nnot accorded a royal welcome, I took French leave and came home again.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the pain--\"\r\n\r\n\"On the way home,\" continued Anko, calmly, \"I was a little\r\nabsent-minded and ate an anchor. There was a long chain attached to it;\r\nand as I continued to swallow the anchor I continued to eat the chain.\r\nI never realized what I had done until I found a ship on the other end\r\nof the chain. Then I bit it off.\"\r\n\r\n\"The ship?\" asked Trot.\r\n\r\n\"No; the chain. I didn't care for the ship, as I saw it contained some\r\nskippers. On the way home the chain and anchor began to lie heavily\r\non my stomach. I didn't seem to digest them properly, and by the time\r\nI got to my palace, where you will notice there is no throne, I was\r\nthrown into throes of severe pain. So I at once sent for Dr. Shark--\"\r\n\r\n\"Are all your doctors sharks?\" asked the child.\r\n\r\n\"Yes; aren't your doctors sharks?\" he replied.\r\n\r\n\"Not all of them,\" said Trot.\r\n\r\n\"That is true,\" remarked Cap'n Bill. \"But when you talk of lawyers--\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not talking of lawyers,\" said Anko, reprovingly; \"I'm talking\r\nabout my pain. I don't imagine anyone could suffer more than I did with\r\nthat stomach ache.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you suffer long?\" inquired Trot.\r\n\r\n\"Why, about seven thousand four hundred and eighty-two feet and--\"\r\n\r\n\"I mean a long time.\"\r\n\r\n\"It seemed like a long time,\" answered the King. \"Dr. Shark said I\r\nought to put a mustard poultice on my stomach; so I uncoiled myself and\r\nsummoned my servants, and they began putting on the mustard plaster. It\r\nhad to be bound all around me, so it wouldn't slip off, and I began to\r\nlook like an express package. In about four weeks fully one-half of the\r\npain had been covered by the mustard poultice, which got so hot that it\r\nhurt me worse than the stomach ache did.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know,\" said Trot. \"I had one, once.\"\r\n\r\n\"One what?\" asked Anko.\r\n\r\n\"A mustard plaster. They smart pretty bad, but I guess they're a good\r\nthing.\"\r\n\r\n\"I got myself unwrapped as soon as I could,\" continued the King, \"and\r\nthen I hunted for the doctor, who hid himself until my anger had\r\nsubsided. He has never sent in a bill, so I think he must be terribly\r\nashamed of himself.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're lucky, sir, to have escaped so easy,\" said Cap'n Bill. \"But you\r\nseem pretty well now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I'm more careful of what I eat,\" replied the Sea Serpent. \"But I\r\nwas saying when Trot interrupted me, that you all belong to me, because\r\nI have saved your lives. By the law of the ocean you must obey me in\r\neverything.\"\r\n\r\nThe sailor scowled a little at hearing this, but Trot laughed, and said:\r\n\r\n\"The law of the ocean isn't _our_ law, 'cause we live on land.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just now you are living in the ocean,\" declared Anko, \"and as long as\r\nyou live here, you must obey my commands.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are your commands?\" inquired the child.\r\n\r\n\"Ah; that's the point I was coming to,\" returned the King, with his\r\ncomical smile. \"The ocean is a beautiful place, and we who belong here\r\nlove it dearly. In many ways it's a nicer place for a home than the\r\nearth, for we have no sunstrokes, mosquitoes, earthquakes or candy\r\nshops to bother us. But I am convinced that the ocean is no proper\r\ndwelling place for earth people, and I believe the mermaids did an\r\nunwise thing when they invited you to visit them.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't,\" protested the girl. \"We've had a fine time; haven't we,\r\nCap'n Bill?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it's been diff'rent from what I expected,\" admitted the sailor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"Our only thought was to give the earth people pleasure, your Majesty,\"\r\npleaded Aquareine.\r\n\r\n\"I know; I know, my dear Queen; and it was very good of you,\" replied\r\nAnko. \"But, still it was an unwise act, for earth people are as\r\nconstantly in danger under water as we would be upon the land. So,\r\nhaving won the right to command you all, I order you to take little\r\nMayre and Cap'n Bill straight home, and there restore them to their\r\nnatural forms. It's a dreadful condition, I know, and they must each\r\nhave two stumbling legs instead of a strong, beautiful fishtail; but it\r\nis the fate of earth dwellers, and they cannot escape it.\"\r\n\r\n\"In my case, your Majesty, made it _one_ leg,\" suggested Cap'n Bill.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, yes; I remember. One leg, and a wooden stick to keep it company.\r\nI issue this order, my friends, not because I am not fond of your\r\nsociety, but to keep you from getting into more trouble in a country\r\nwhere all is strange and unnatural to you. Am I right, or do you think\r\nI am wrong?\"\r\n\r\n\"You're quite correct, sir,\" said Cap'n Bill, nodding his head in\r\napproval.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'm ready to go home,\" said Trot. \"But in spite of Zog, I've\r\nenjoyed my visit, and I shall always love the mermaids for being so\r\ngood to me.\"\r\n\r\nThat speech pleased Aquareine and Clia, who smiled upon the child, and\r\nkissed her affectionately.\r\n\r\n\"We shall escort you home at once,\" announced the Queen.\r\n\r\n\"But before you go,\" said King Anko, \"I will give you a rare treat. It\r\nis one you will remember as long as you live. You shall see every inch\r\nof the mightiest sea serpent in the world, all at one time!\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, the purple and gold cloth was lifted by unseen hands and\r\ndisappeared from view. And now Cap'n Bill and Trot looked down upon\r\nthousands and thousands of coils of the sea serpent's body, which\r\nfilled all of the space at the bottom of the immense circular room.\r\nIt reminded them of a great coil of garden hose, only it was so much\r\nbigger around, and very much longer.\r\n\r\nExcept for the astonishing size of the Ocean King, the sight was not\r\nan especially interesting one; but they told old Anko that they were\r\npleased to see him, because it was evident he was very proud of his\r\nfigure.\r\n\r\nThen the cloth descended again and covered all but the head; after\r\nwhich they bade the king good-bye and thanked him for all his kindness\r\nto them.\r\n\r\n\"I used to think sea serpents were horrid creatures,\" said Trot; \"but\r\nnow I know they are good and--and--and--\"\r\n\r\n\"And big,\" added Cap'n Bill, realizing his little friend could not find\r\nanother word that was complimentary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Chap. 21._\r\n\r\nKING JOE]\r\n\r\n\r\nAs they swam out of Anko's palace and the doll-faced fishes left them,\r\nAquareine asked:\r\n\r\n\"Would you rather go back to our mermaid home for a time, and rest\r\nyourselves, or would you prefer to start for Giant's Cave at once?\"\r\n\r\n\"I guess we'd better go back home,\" decided Trot. \"To our own home, I\r\nmean. We've been away quite a while, and King Anko seemed to think it\r\nwas best.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" replied the Queen. \"Let us turn in this direction, then.\"\r\n\r\n\"You can say good-bye to Merla for us,\" continued Trot. \"She was very\r\nnice to us, an' 'specially to Cap'n Bill.\"\r\n\r\n\"So she was, mate,\" agreed the sailor; \"an' a prettier lady I never\r\nknew, even if she is a mermaid, beggin' your pardon, ma'am.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are we going anywhere near Zog's castle?\" asked the girl.\r\n\r\n\"Our way leads directly past the opening in the dome,\" said Aquareine.\r\n\r\n\"Then, let's stop and see what Sacho and the others are doing,\"\r\nsuggested Trot. \"They can't be slaves any longer, you know, 'cause they\r\nhaven't any master. I wonder if they're any happier than they were\r\nbefore?\"\r\n\r\n\"They seemed to be pretty happy as it was,\" remarked Cap'n Bill.\r\n\r\n\"It will do no harm to pay them a brief visit,\" said Princess Clia.\r\n\"All danger disappeared from the cavern with the destruction of Zog.\"\r\n\r\n\"I really ought to say good-bye to Brother Joe,\" observed the\r\nsailorman. \"I won't see him again, you know, and I don't want to seem\r\nunbrotherly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" said the Queen, \"we will reënter the cavern, for I, too,\r\nam anxious to know what will be the fate of the poor slaves of the\r\nmagician.\"\r\n\r\nWhen they came to the hole in the top of the dome they dropped through\r\nit and swam leisurely down toward the castle. The water was clear and\r\nundisturbed and the silver castle looked very quiet and peaceful under\r\nthe radiant light that still filled the cavern.\r\n\r\nThey met no one at all, and passing around to the front of the\r\nbuilding they reached the broad entrance and passed into the golden\r\nhall.\r\n\r\nHere a strange scene met their eyes. All the slaves of Zog, hundreds in\r\nnumber, were assembled in the room; while standing before the throne\r\nformerly occupied by the wicked magician was the boy Sacho, who was\r\njust beginning to make a speech to his fellow slaves.\r\n\r\n\"At one time or another,\" he said, \"all of us were born upon the\r\nearth and lived in the thin air; but now we are all living as the\r\nfishes live, and our home is in the water of the ocean. One by one we\r\nhave come to this place, having been saved from drowning by Zog, the\r\nMagician, and by him given power to exist in comfort under water. The\r\npowerful master who made us his slaves has now passed away forever,\r\nbut we continue to live, and are unable to return to our native land,\r\nwhere we would quickly perish. There is no one but us to inherit Zog's\r\npossessions, and so it will be best for us to remain in this fine\r\ncastle and occupy ourselves as we have done before, in providing for\r\nthe comforts of the community. Only in labor is happiness to be found,\r\nand we may as well labor for ourselves as for others.\r\n\r\n\"But we must have a king. Not an evil, cruel master, like Zog, but one\r\nwho will maintain order and issue laws for the benefit of all. We will\r\ngovern ourselves most happily by having a ruler, or head, selected from\r\namong ourselves by popular vote. Therefore, I ask you to decide who\r\nshall be our king, for only one who is accepted by all can sit in Zog's\r\nthrone.\"\r\n\r\nThe slaves applauded this speech, but they seemed puzzled to make the\r\nchoice of a ruler. Finally the chief cook came forward and said:\r\n\r\n\"We all have our duties to perform, and so cannot spend the time to be\r\nking. But you, Sacho, who were Zog's own attendant, have now no duties\r\nat all. So it will be best for you to rule us. What say you, comrades?\r\nShall we make Sacho king?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes!\" they all cried.\r\n\r\n\"But I do not wish to be king,\" replied Sacho. \"A king is a useless\r\nsort of person, who merely issues orders for others to carry out. I\r\nwant to be busy and useful. Whoever is king will need a good attendant,\r\nas well as an officer who will see that his commands are obeyed. I am\r\nused to such duties, having served Zog in this same way.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who, then, has the time to rule over us?\" asked Agga-Groo, the\r\ngoldsmith.\r\n\r\n\"It seems to me that Cap'n Joe is the proper person for king,\" replied\r\nSacho. \"His former duty was to sew buttons on Zog's garments; so now he\r\nis out of a job and has plenty of time to be king, for he can sew on\r\nhis own buttons. What do you say, Cap'n Joe?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I don't mind,\" agreed Cap'n Joe; \"that is, if you all want me to\r\nrule you.\"\r\n\r\n\"We do!\" shouted the slaves, glad to find some one willing to take the\r\njob.\r\n\r\n\"But I'll want a few pointers,\" continued Cap'n Bill's brother. \"I\r\nain't used to this sort o' work, you know, an' if I ain't properly\r\nposted I'm liable to make mistakes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sacho will tell you,\" said Tom Atto, encouragingly. \"And now I must go\r\nback to the kitchen and look after my dumplings, or you people won't\r\nhave any dinner to-day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" announced Sacho. \"I hereby proclaim Cap'n Joe elected King\r\nof the Castle--which is the Enchanted Castle no longer. You may all\r\nreturn to your work.\"\r\n\r\nThe slaves went away well contented, and the boy and Cap'n Joe now came\r\nforward to greet their visitors.\r\n\r\n\"We're on our way home,\" explained Cap'n Bill, \"an' we don't expec' to\r\ntravel this way again. But it pleases me to know, Joe, that you're the\r\nking o' such a fine castle, an' I'll rest easier now that you're well\r\npervided for.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I'm all right, Bill,\" returned Cap'n Joe. \"It's an easy life here,\r\nan' a peaceful one. I wish you was as well fixed.\"\r\n\r\n\"If ever you need friends, Sacho, or any assistance or counsel, come to\r\nme,\" said the Mermaid Queen to the boy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, madam,\" he replied. \"Now that Zog has gone, I am sure we\r\nshall be very safe and contented. But I shall not forget to come to\r\nyou if we need you. We are not going to waste any time in anger, or\r\nrevenge, or evil deeds; so I believe we shall prosper from now on.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure you will,\" declared Trot.\r\n\r\nThey now decided that they must continue their journey, and as neither\r\nSacho nor King Joe could ascend to the top of the dome, without\r\nswimming in the human way, which was slow and tedious work for them,\r\nthe good-byes were said at the castle entrance, and the four visitors\r\nstarted on their return.\r\n\r\nTrot took one last view of the beautiful silver castle from the hole\r\nhigh up in the dome, which was now open and unguarded, and the next\r\nmoment she was in the broad ocean again, swimming toward home beside\r\nher mermaid friends.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Chap. 22._\r\n\r\nTROT LIVES TO TELL THE TALE]\r\n\r\n\r\nAquareine was thoughtful for a time. Then she drew from her finger a\r\nring--a plain gold band, set with a pearl of great value--and gave it\r\nto the little girl.\r\n\r\n\"If at any period of your life the mermaids can be of service to you,\r\nmy dear,\" she said, \"you have but to come to the edge of the ocean and\r\ncall 'Aquareine.' If you are wearing this ring at the time I shall\r\ninstantly hear you and come to your assistance.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you!\" cried the child, slipping the ring over her own chubby\r\nfinger, which it fitted perfectly. \"I shall never forget that I have\r\ngood and loyal friends in the ocean, you may be sure.\"\r\n\r\nAway and away they swam, swiftly and in a straight line, keeping in the\r\nmiddle water where they were not liable to meet many sea people. They\r\npassed a few schools of fishes, where the teachers were explaining to\r\nthe young ones how to swim properly, and to conduct themselves in a\r\ndignified manner; but Trot did not care to stop and watch the exercises.\r\n\r\nAlthough the queen had lost her fairy wand in Zog's domed chamber, she\r\nhad still enough magic power to carry them all across the ocean in\r\nwonderfully quick time, and before Trot and Cap'n Bill were aware of\r\nthe distance they had come the mermaids paused, while Princess Clia\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"Now we must go a little deeper; for here is the Giant's Cave, and the\r\nentrance to it is near the bottom of the sea.\"\r\n\r\n\"What, already!\" cried the girl, joyfully; and then through the darker\r\nwater they swam, passing through the rocky entrance, and began to\r\nascend slowly into the azure-blue water of the cave.\r\n\r\n\"You've been awfully good to us, and I don't know jus' how to thank\r\nyou,\" said Trot, earnestly.\r\n\r\n\"We have enjoyed your visit to us,\" said beautiful Queen Aquareine,\r\nsmiling upon her little friend, \"and you may easily repay any pleasure\r\nwe have given you by speaking well of the mermaids when you hear\r\nignorant earth people condemning us.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll do that, of course,\" exclaimed the child.\r\n\r\n\"How 'bout changin' us back to our reg'lar shapes?\" inquired Cap'n\r\nBill, anxiously.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"That will be very easy,\" replied Princess Clia, with her merry laugh.\r\n\"See! here we are at the surface of the water.\"\r\n\r\nThey pushed their heads above the blue water and looked around the\r\ncave. It was silent and deserted. Floating gently near the spot where\r\nthey had left it was their own little boat.\r\n\r\nCap'n Bill swam to it, took hold of the side, and then turned an\r\ninquiring face toward the mermaids.\r\n\r\n\"Climb in,\" said the Queen.\r\n\r\nSo he pulled himself up and awkwardly tumbled forward into the boat. As\r\nhe did so he heard his wooden leg clatter against the seat, and turned\r\naround to look at it wonderingly.\r\n\r\n\"It's me, all right!\" he muttered. \"One meat one, an' one hick'ry one.\r\nThat's the same as belongs to me!\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you lift Mayre aboard?\" asked Princess Clia.\r\n\r\nThe old sailor aroused himself, and as Trot lifted up her arms he\r\nseized them and drew her safely into the boat. She was dressed just as\r\nusual, and her chubby legs wore shoes and stockings. Strangely enough,\r\nneither of them were at all wet, or even damp in any part of their\r\nclothing.\r\n\r\n\"I wonder where our legs have been while we've been gone?\" mused Cap'n\r\nBill, gazing at his little friend in great delight.\r\n\r\n\"And I wonder what's become of our pretty pink and green scaled tails!\"\r\nreturned the girl, laughing with glee, for it seemed good to be herself\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nQueen Aquareine and Princess Clia were a little way off, lying with\r\ntheir pretty faces just out of the water, while their hair floated in\r\nsoft clouds around them.\r\n\r\n\"Good-bye, friends!\" they called.\r\n\r\n\"Good-bye!\" shouted both Trot and Cap'n Bill, and the little girl blew\r\ntwo kisses from her fingers toward the mermaids.\r\n\r\nThen the faces disappeared, leaving little ripples on the surface of\r\nthe water.\r\n\r\nCap'n Bill picked up the oars and slowly headed the boat toward the\r\nmouth of the cave.\r\n\r\n\"I wonder, Trot, if your ma has missed us,\" he remarked, uneasily.\r\n\r\n\"Of course not,\" replied the girl. \"She's been sound asleep, you know.\"\r\n\r\nAs the boat crept out into the bright sunlight they were both silent;\r\nbut each sighed with pleasure at beholding their own everyday world\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nFinally Trot said, softly:\r\n\r\n\"The land's the best, Cap'n.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is, mate; for livin' on,\" he answered.\r\n\r\n\"But, I'm glad to have seen the mermaids,\" she added.\r\n\r\n\"Well, so 'm I, Trot,\" he agreed. \"But, I wouldn't 'a' believed any\r\nmortal could ever 'a' seen 'em an'--an'--\"\r\n\r\nTrot laughed merrily.\r\n\r\n\"An' lived to tell the tale!\" she cried, her eyes dancing with\r\nmischief. \"Oh, Cap'n Bill, how little we mortals know!\"\r\n\r\n\"True enough, mate,\" he replied; \"but we're a-learnin' something ev'ry\r\nday.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE END]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    +--------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n    |                      Transcriber Notes:                            |\r\n    |                                                                    |\r\n    | Note: The equals sign is used to surround  underscores to          |\r\n    |  surround _italic text_.                                           |\r\n    |                                                                    |\r\n    | Fixed various punctuation.                                         |\r\n    |                                                                    |\r\n    | P. 95. \"courses.
