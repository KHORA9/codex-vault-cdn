Apart from the not\r\ninconsiderable number of general works on the potter’s art in French,\r\nGerman, and English, there is scarcely to be found a kiln where pottery\r\nof one kind or another has been manufactured which has not been made the\r\nsubject of a separate study. And yet, as far as I know, the very\r\ndefinite subdivision of ceramics, which includes the porcelain of the\r\nFar East and of Europe, has never been made the basis of an independent\r\nwork in England.\r\n\r\nIt has been the aim of the writer to dwell more especially on the nature\r\nof the paste, on the glaze, and on the decoration of the various wares,\r\nand above all to accentuate any points that throw light upon the\r\nrelations with one another--especially the historical relations--of the\r\ndifferent centres where porcelain has been made. Less attention has been\r\ngiven to the question of marks. In the author’s opinion, the exaggerated\r\nimportance that has been given to these marks, both by collectors and by\r\nthe writers that have catered to them, has more than anything else\r\ntended to degrade the study of the subject, and to turn off the\r\nattention from more essential points. This has been above all the case\r\nin England, where the technical side has been strangely neglected. In\r\nfact, we must turn to French works for any thorough information on this\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nIn the bibliographical list it has been impossible to distinguish the\r\nrelative value of the books included. I think that _something_ of value\r\nmay be found in nearly every one of these works, but in many, whatever\r\nthere is of original information might be summed up in a few pages. In\r\nfact, the books really essential to the student are few in number. For\r\nOriental china we have the Franks catalogue, M. Vogt’s little book, _La\r\nPorcelaine_, and above all the great work of Dr. Bushell, which is\r\nunfortunately not very accessible. For Continental porcelain there is no\r\n‘up-to-date’ work in English, but the brief notes in the catalogue\r\nprepared shortly before his death by Sir A. W. Franks have the advantage\r\nof being absolutely trustworthy. The best account of German porcelain is\r\nperhaps to be found in Dr. Brinckmann’s bulky description of the Hamburg\r\nMuseum, which deals, however, with many subjects besides porcelain,\r\nwhile for Sèvres we have the works of Garnier and Vogt. For English\r\nporcelain the literature is enormous, but there is little of importance\r\nthat will not be found in Professor Church’s little handbook, or in the\r\nlately published works of Mr. Burton and Mr. Solon. The last edition of\r\nthe guide to the collection lately at Jermyn Street has been well edited\r\nby Mr. Rudler, and contains much information on the technical side of\r\nthe subject. On many historical points the notes in the last edition of\r\nMarryat are still invaluable: the quotations, however, require checking,\r\nand the original passages are often very difficult to unearth.\r\n\r\nIn the course of this book I have touched upon several interesting\r\nproblems which it would be impossible to thoroughly discuss in a general\r\nwork of this kind. I take, however, the occasion of bringing one or two\r\nof these points to the notice of future investigators.\r\n\r\nMuch light remains to be thrown upon the relations of the Chinese with\r\nthe people of Western Asia during the Middle Ages. We want to know at\r\nwhat time and under what influences the Chinese began to decorate their\r\nporcelain, first with blue under the glaze, and afterwards by means of\r\nglazes of three or more colours, painted on the biscuit. The relation of\r\nthis latter method of decoration to the true enamel-painting which\r\nsucceeded it is still obscure. So again, to come to a later time, there\r\nis much difference of opinion as to the date of the first introduction\r\nof the _rouge d’or_, a very important point in the history and\r\nclassification of Chinese porcelain.\r\n\r\nWe are much in the dark as to the source of the porcelain exported both\r\nfrom China and Japan in the seventeenth century, especially of the\r\nroughly painted ‘blue and white,’ of which such vast quantities went to\r\nIndia and Persia. So of the Japanese ‘Kakiyemon,’ which had so much\r\ninfluence on our European wares, what was the origin of the curious\r\ndesign, and what was the relation of this ware to the now better known\r\n‘Old Japan’?\r\n\r\nWhen we come nearer home, to the European porcelain of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, many obscure points still remain to be cleared up. The\r\ncurrently accepted accounts of Böttger’s great discovery present many\r\ndifficulties. At Sèvres, why was the use of the newly discovered _rose\r\nPompadour_ so soon abandoned? And finally, in England, what were we\r\ndoing during the long years between the time of the early experiments of\r\nDr. Dwight and the great outburst of energy in the middle of the\r\neighteenth century?\r\n\r\nThe illustrations have been chosen for the most part from specimens in\r\nour national collections. I take this opportunity of thanking the\r\nofficials in charge of these collections for the facilities they have\r\ngiven to me in the selection of the examples, and to the photographer in\r\nthe reproduction of the pieces selected. To Mr. C. H. Read of the\r\nBritish Museum, and to Mr. Skinner of the Victoria and Albert Museum, my\r\nthanks are above all due. To the latter gentleman I am much indebted for\r\nthe trouble he has taken, amid arduous official duties, in making\r\narrangements for photographing not only examples belonging to the\r\nMuseum, scattered as these are through various wide-lying departments,\r\nbut also several other pieces of porcelain at present deposited there by\r\nprivate collectors. To these gentlemen, finally, my thanks are due for\r\npermission to reproduce examples of their porcelain--to Mr. Pierpont\r\nMorgan, to Mr. Fitzhenry, to Mr. David Currie, and above all to my\r\nfriend Mr. George Salting, who has interested himself in the selection\r\nof the objects from his unrivalled collection.\r\n\r\nThe small collection of marks at the end of the book has no claim to\r\noriginality. The examples have been selected from the catalogues of the\r\nSchreiber collection at South Kensington, and from those of the Franks\r\ncollections of Oriental and Continental china. For permission to use the\r\nblocks my thanks are due, as far as the first two books are concerned,\r\nto H. M.’s Stationery Office and to the Education Department; in the\r\ncase of the last work, to Mr. C. H. Read, who, I understand, himself\r\ndrew the original marks for Sir A. W. Franks’s catalogue.\r\n\r\nIn a general work of this kind much important matter has had to be\r\nomitted. That is inevitable. I only hope that specialists in certain\r\ndefinite parts of the wide field covered will not find that I have\r\ncommitted myself to rash or ungrounded generalisations. Let them\r\nremember that the carefully guarded statements and the reservations\r\nsuitable to a scientific paper would be out of place in a work intended\r\nin the main for the general public.\r\n\r\nE.

Porcelain or china, in all countries except\r\nthe one where it was slowly brought to perfection, has always remained\r\nsomething of an exotic, and even in China we shall see that it was the\r\nimmediate Imperial patronage and the constant demand for the court at\r\nPekin that brought about the great development of the art under the\r\npresent dynasty. In Japan, the first independent country to which the\r\nnew art spread, it was under the eye of the greater and smaller feudal\r\nlords, often in the very garden of their palaces, that the kilns were\r\nerected, while the ware produced was reserved for the use of the prince\r\nand his household. Both in China and Japan we shall find the decline of\r\nthe art to go hand in hand with the advance of the demand for the\r\nWestern market, so that by the beginning of the nineteenth century we\r\nlose all interest in the manufacture.\r\n\r\nThis dependence upon royal or princely support is equally prominent in\r\nthe history of the shortlived porcelain factories of Europe. Their\r\nsuccess or failure has generally followed closely upon the greater or\r\nless interest taken in them by the reigning prince, and few of these\r\nkilns survived the political changes of the end of the eighteenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nNo doubt, within the last twenty years or so a certain revival has come\r\nabout both in the Far East and in certain European countries, and that\r\nunder totally different conditions from those which prevailed in the\r\neighteenth century. Here and there, at least, the manufacture of\r\nporcelain has come within the sphere of the new impulses that have\r\nbrought about such changes in the ‘Arts and Crafts’ at the end of the\r\nnineteenth century.\r\n\r\nIn its main lines, the history of porcelain is a very simple one. Slowly\r\ndeveloped during the Middle Ages in China, the manufacture became\r\nconcentrated at one spot, at King-te-chen, and there reached its highest\r\ndevelopment early in the eighteenth century. In Europe, the repeated\r\nattempts to produce a similar ware had about the same time been crowned\r\nwith complete success in Saxony; while in England and in France a ware\r\nclosely resembling in aspect the Chinese, but softer and more fusible,\r\nhad been accepted as an equivalent. Speaking generally, then, we can\r\nmake these three statements with regard to the history of porcelain:--\r\n\r\n1. That the art had its origin and complete development in China.\r\n\r\n2. That it has seldom flourished except under royal or princely\r\npatronage.\r\n\r\n3. That porcelain, from the artistic point of view, is essentially a\r\nproduct of the eighteenth century, and that this statement is true in\r\nthe main as regards the country of its origin, though in this latter\r\ncase we must make a certain reserve in favour of the earlier wares.\r\n\r\nOur subject may seem a simple one compared with some kindred branches of\r\nthe industrial arts, such, for example, as the history of glass-making,\r\nor that of cloisonné and other enamels. We come indeed at more than one\r\ntime into contact with both these arts, and it is just at these points\r\nthat some of our chief difficulties arise. It is in view of such\r\nquestions as these, and indeed of many others equally important in the\r\nhistory of porcelain, that the necessity of a thorough understanding of\r\nthe technical and even chemical side of our subject becomes evident. Of\r\ncourse, if in discussing the different kinds of porcelain we are\r\nconcerned only with their merits or demerits as artistic products, we\r\ncan put aside these practical questions as ‘beneath the dignity of our\r\nargument.’ But such a treatment of the subject would land us only too\r\nsurely in vague generalities and in an arrangement based upon personal\r\ncaprice. We require, above all at the start, a firm basis, and this can\r\nonly be found in a thorough comprehension not only of the technical\r\nprocesses that are involved in the manufacture of porcelain, but of the\r\nphysical and chemical nature of the substance itself.\r\n\r\nBut first we need some kind of preliminary definition of what is meant\r\nby the word. Porcelain, then, is distinguished from other fictile wares\r\nby possessing in a pre-eminent degree the following qualities: hardness,\r\ndifficult fusibility, translucency, and whiteness of body or paste. Any\r\nspecimen of ceramic ware that possesses all these qualities may be\r\nclassed as porcelain, and from a practical point of view, the more it\r\nexcels under these heads, the better specimen of porcelain it is.\r\n\r\nThese were the qualities by which the porcelain brought from the East in\r\nthe seventeenth century was distinguished from any ware made at that\r\ntime in Europe. Our ancestors dwelt especially on the practical\r\nadvantages of the hard glaze and the elastic compact paste of the new\r\nware, which compared favourably with the easily scratched surface and\r\nthe crumbly body of the earthenware then in general use.\r\n\r\nThe greater infusibility that accompanies this hardness was not a point\r\nof much importance to them, but they marvelled at the translucency of\r\nthe edges, as of some natural stone, and we find absurdly exaggerated\r\naccounts of the transparency both of the original ware and of the\r\nimitation that they claimed to have made. Finally, they noticed that the\r\nwhiteness of the surface was not given by an artificial layer more or\r\nless closely adhering to an earthy base, but was the natural colour of\r\nthe paste to which the thin layer of transparent glaze merely gave the\r\neffect of the polish on ivory or on marble. What then was this hard,\r\nwhite, translucent substance? What wonder if from one end of Europe to\r\nthe other, scheming minds--chemists, alchemists, physicians, potters,\r\nand charlatans--were at work trying to make something that should\r\nresemble it? The history of this long search is a very interesting one,\r\nbut it would be impossible to explain its failures, its partial failures\r\n(these last resulting in a compromise--soft-paste porcelain), and the\r\nfinal success of Böttger, without, as it were, going behind the scenes,\r\nand giving some account of porcelain from a modern, scientific point of\r\nview.\r\n\r\nAnd first let us say that, although when treating of porcelain from the\r\nhistorical and especially from the æsthetic standpoint (and this after\r\nall is our principal business in this book), it is well to take a wide\r\ngrasp and include a whole class of china--I mean the soft-paste\r\nware--which does not come up to our standard of hardness and\r\ninfusibility, this is not the case when we are considering the physical,\r\nand especially the chemical, nature of porcelain. By confining\r\nourselves, for the present, to true hard porcelain, we have the\r\nadvantage of dealing with a substance which chemically and physically\r\nmay be compared to a definite mineral species. Nay more, we propose here\r\nto confine ourselves to the consideration of the hard pastes used at the\r\npresent day in the wares of France and Germany, neglecting for the\r\npresent the softer and more irregular porcelain of the Chinese.\r\n\r\nFirst as regards hardness, the surface of the paste of a true porcelain,\r\nwhen free from glaze, can be scratched by a crystal of quartz, but it is\r\nuntouched by the hardest steel. That is to say, it would be classed by\r\nthe mineralogist with felspar, and given a hardness of 6 to 6·5 on his\r\nscale.[1]\r\n\r\nThe freshly broken edge shows a white, perfectly uniform substance, a\r\nglassy or vitreous lustre, a finely granular texture, and a fracture\r\nconchoidal to splintery. When struck, a vessel of porcelain gives a\r\nclear, bell-like note, and in this differs from other kinds of pottery.\r\nWhen held against the light it allows, where the piece is sufficiently\r\nthin, a certain amount to pass through, but even in the thinnest\r\nsplinters porcelain is never transparent.\r\n\r\nIf a thin section be made of a piece of porcelain, and this be examined\r\nunder the microscope by transmitted light, we see, scattered in a clear,\r\nor nearly clear, paste, a vast number of minute, slender rods, and\r\nbetween them many minute granules (Church’s _English Porcelain_, p. 6).\r\nThese belonites and spherulites, as they have been called, doubtless\r\nreflect the light which would otherwise pass through the glassy base in\r\nwhich they float, and the partial reflection and partial transmission of\r\nthe light may not be unconnected with the lustrous fracture so\r\ncharacteristic of porcelain. Their presence points to the fact that we\r\nare dealing with a more or less definite substance, one which may be\r\ncompared to a natural mineral species, and not merely with a semi-fused\r\nclay, something between stoneware and glass. Now when we come to treat\r\nof the chemical constitution of porcelain, we shall find that this view\r\nis confirmed. This structure is developed in the paste by the exposure,\r\nfor a considerable period of time, to a temperature of from 1300° to\r\n1500° centigrade, a temperature which is sufficient to reduce all other\r\nkinds of pottery, with the exception of some kinds of stoneware, to a\r\nglassy mass. In the case of porcelain, this great and prolonged heat\r\nallows of a complete rearrangement of the molecules in the softened\r\nmass. The process may be compared to that by which certain minerals and\r\nrocks are formed in the depths of the earth.\r\n\r\nWe see, then, that not only from the standpoint of history, but on the\r\nbasis of the physical properties and intimate constitution of the\r\nmaterial, we are able to draw a sharp line between porcelain and other\r\nfictile wares. This distinction is even more definitely shown by a\r\nchemical analysis.[2]\r\n\r\nWe are dealing, as in the case of so large a part of the rocks and\r\nminerals of the earth’s surface, with certain silicates of the alkalis\r\nand alkaline earths, with silicates of alumina above all. All natural\r\nclays used for fictile purposes consist essentially of silicates of\r\nvarious bases, such as alumina, lime, iron, potash, and soda, more or\r\nless intimately combined with water, and with the addition, generally,\r\nof some free silica. If the clay be good in working quality and colour,\r\nthe next point the potter has to look to is the question of its\r\nfusibility. It may be said generally that the simpler the constitution\r\nof a silicate, that is the smaller the number of bases that it contains,\r\nthe greater will be its resistance to fire. Silicate of alumina is\r\nunaltered at 1500° C., a temperature which may be taken as the maximum\r\nat the command of the potter. The fusing-point is reduced by the\r\naddition of silica, especially if some other bases such as oxide of iron\r\nor lime, or again an alkali, are present even in small quantity. But\r\nbeyond a certain point the addition of silica raises the fusing-point,\r\nand it is important to note that it is this excess of silica that\r\nrenders certain stonewares and fire-clays so infusible. In the case of\r\nporcelain, on the other hand, the resistance to high temperatures\r\ndepends more upon the percentage of alumina present, and the absence or\r\nsmall amount of other bases. Thus in comparing the composition of\r\ndifferent porcelains, we find that it is those that contain the most\r\nsilica that are the most fusible, or rather, to speak more accurately,\r\nthat become ‘porcelainised’ at a lower temperature.[3]\r\n\r\nThe relation of porcelain to stoneware on the one hand, and to ordinary\r\npottery on the other, will be made clear by the following figures, which\r\ngive the composition of stoneware, Meissen porcelain, and of a red\r\nSamian ware:--\r\n\r\n                      Stoneware.     Meissen Porcelain.   Samian Ware.\r\n\r\n  Silica,             80 per cent.   58 per cent.        61 per cent.\r\n  Alumina,            12    ”        36    ”             21    ”\r\n  Potash and Soda,     5    ”         5    ”              5    ”\r\n  Lime and Iron,       3    ”         1    ”             13    ”\r\n\r\nThe refractory stoneware contains a large excess of silica over the\r\namount required to combine with the alumina and the ‘other bases.’ In\r\nthe easily fusible Roman pottery, the ‘other bases’ nearly equal in\r\namount the alumina, while the Meissen porcelain not only contains less\r\nsilica than the pottery, but the ‘other bases’ only amount to a sixth\r\npart of the alumina present.\r\n\r\nBut it is not enough for the manufacturer to discover a clay of which\r\nthe chemical composition corresponds to that of the type of porcelain\r\nwhich he proposes to make. The question, as an experiment of Brongniart\r\nlong ago proved, is more complicated. Brongniart weighed out the\r\nseparate constituents for his porcelain--the silica, the alumina, and\r\nthe alkalis--and from them he formed his paste. He found, however, that\r\nthe paste readily melted at the heat of the porcelain furnace. The\r\nanalysis then of any ceramic product can give us but an imperfect clue\r\nto the nature and properties of the ware. We want to know how the\r\nelements are arranged, and this can only be inferred from a knowledge of\r\nthe materials employed in the manufacture. I will illustrate this point\r\nby comparing the composition of Meissen porcelain with that of our\r\nDorsetshire pipe-clay, the most famous of our English clays, but a\r\nmaterial not sufficiently refractory for use in the manufacture of\r\nporcelain. Both substances contain the same amount of alumina--36 per\r\ncent.; in the Poole clay (after removing the water) there is 55 per\r\ncent. of silica and 9 per cent. of ‘other bases,’ against 58 per cent.\r\nand 6 per cent. respectively in the porcelain. The composition,\r\ntherefore, of the two bodies is nearly the same: the clay, while it\r\ncontains more iron-oxide and lime than the porcelain, is poorer in\r\nsilica.\r\n\r\nTrue porcelain has indeed never been made from any other materials than\r\nthose so long employed by the Chinese and first described by the\r\nmissionary, Père D’Entrecolles, nearly two hundred years ago.\r\n\r\nThe two essential elements in the composition of porcelain are--(_a_)\r\nThe hydrated silicate of alumina, which is provided by the white earthy\r\nclay known as kaolin or china-clay, a substance infusible at the highest\r\ntemperature attainable by our furnaces (about 1500° C.); (_b_) The\r\nsilicate of alumina and potash (or more rarely soda), that is to say\r\nfelspar. But the felspar is generally associated with some amount of\r\nboth quartz and mica, and is itself in a more or less disintegrated\r\ncondition. This is the substance known as petuntse or china-stone. It is\r\nfusible at the higher temperatures of the porcelain kiln.\r\n\r\nOf those substances the first is an immediate product of the weathering\r\nof the felspar contained in granitic rocks; while the second, the\r\npetuntse, is nothing else than the granite (or allied rock) itself in a\r\nmore or less weathered condition.\r\n\r\nWe see, then, that speaking generally, granite is the source of both the\r\nmaterials whose intimate mixture in the state of the finest comminution\r\nconstitutes the paste of porcelain. It thus happens that it is only in\r\nregions of primitive rocks, far away as a rule from centres of industry\r\nand indeed from the usual sources of the clay used for fictile ware,\r\nthat the materials essential for making porcelain are found. By the term\r\ngranite we mean here a crystalline rock consisting of felspar, quartz,\r\nand mica, and we include in the term gneiss, which differs only in the\r\narrangement of its constituents. The many varieties of rock that are\r\nnamed as sources of kaolin and petuntse, such as pegmatite, graphic\r\ngranite, or growan-stone, are as a rule varieties of granite[4]\r\ndistinguished by containing little or no mica, and above all by the\r\nabsence of iron in appreciable quantity. As felspar is also the sole or\r\nat least the principal element in the glaze with which porcelain is\r\ncovered, it will be seen that it is the mineral with which we are above\r\nall concerned.\r\n\r\nNow, of the three minerals that enter into the constitution of these\r\ngranitic rocks (the others are quartz and mica), felspar is the one\r\nmost easily acted on by air and water. The carbonic acid which is always\r\npresent in the surface-water gradually removes the alkaline constituents\r\nin the form of soluble carbonates, the silicate of alumina which remains\r\ntakes up and combines with a certain quantity of water, and in this form\r\nit is washed down into hollows to form the beds of white crumbly clay\r\nknown as kaolin. This is, of course, a somewhat general and theoretical\r\nstatement of what happens. If we were to examine the actual position and\r\ngeological relation to the surrounding rocks of the beds of kaolin in\r\nCornwall and in the south-west of France, there might be some exceptions\r\nto be made and difficulties to explain. Where, indeed, as in many places\r\nin Cornwall, the kaolinisation has extended to great depth, the\r\ndecomposition may have been caused by deep-seated agencies; in such\r\ncases the kaolin is often associated with minerals containing fluorine\r\nand boron.[5]\r\n\r\nAs for the other constituent of porcelain, the petuntse or china-stone,\r\nwe have called it a disintegrated granite, and this is the condition in\r\nwhich it is usually excavated. It corresponds to the French _cailloux_,\r\nthe stony or gravelly material as opposed to the clay. In French works\r\nit is not generally distinguished from felspar, and indeed some\r\nvarieties of petuntse may contain little else. However, if pure felspar\r\nis used, the second constituent in granite or in petuntse, I mean\r\nquartz, will have to be added to our porcelain paste in the form of sand\r\nor powdered flint. The third constituent of the china-stone, the mica,\r\nis usually neglected: in many cases the mother rock contains but little,\r\nand what there is is eliminated in the washing. Mica is more fusible\r\nthan felspar; the white variety, muscovite, is practically free from\r\niron, and only from granite rocks containing this variety can petuntse\r\nsuitable for the manufacture of porcelain be obtained. The importance of\r\nmica as an element of the Chinese petuntse has only recently been\r\nrecognised (Vogt, _Comptes Rendus_, 1890, p. 43). As much as 40 per\r\ncent. of muscovite has been found in samples brought from China. The\r\npegmatite of the Limoges district, on the other hand, contains only 30\r\nper cent. of this white mica, and of this only a small portion passes\r\ninto the paste. We have here, perhaps, the principal cause of the\r\ngreater hardness and the higher softening-point of European compared\r\nwith Oriental porcelain.\r\n\r\nWe shall see later on that this softer Chinese paste has many\r\nadvantages, especially in its relation to the glaze and the enamels, but\r\nfor the present we will continue to take the more ‘severe’ European\r\nporcelain as our type.\r\n\r\nLet us consider what takes place during the firing of a paste of this\r\nlatter description. After all the water, including that in combination\r\nin the kaolin, has been driven off, we have, as the temperature rises,\r\nan intimate mixture of two silicates, one of which, if heated alone,\r\nwould be unaltered by any temperature at our command--this is the\r\nsilicate of alumina derived from the kaolin; while the other is a\r\nfusible silicate of alumina and potash. There is also present a certain\r\namount of free silica. There is reason to believe that at a certain\r\npoint a chemical reaction takes place between these constituents,\r\naccompanied by a local rapid rise of temperature in the materials, the\r\nrise being due to this reaction. As a result there is a rearrangement of\r\nthe molecules of the mass, although no complete fusion takes place. It\r\nis now, says M. Vernadsky (_Comptes Rendus_, 1890, p. 1377)--we are now\r\nfollowing the account of his experiments--that the sub-crystalline\r\nrods--the baculites of which we have already spoken--are formed. M.\r\nVernadsky claims to have separated these rods from the glassy base by\r\nmeans of hydrofluoric acid, in which the former were insoluble. He found\r\nthem to consist of a very basic silicate of alumina, containing as much\r\nas 70 per cent. of that earth, while the glassy base was chiefly\r\ncomposed of silica in combination with the potash and with a small\r\nquantity of alumina. In their optical properties the crystals or\r\nbaculites resemble the mineral known as sillimanite, a natural silicate\r\nof alumina.\r\n\r\nThis is all that scientific research has so far been able to tell us of\r\nthe intimate constitution of porcelain; but as far as it goes, it is\r\nevidence in favour of our claim that we are dealing with a definite\r\nsubstance, _sui generis_, and not merely with a casual mixture of\r\ncertain superior kinds of clay, something, as we have said, between\r\nglass and stoneware.\r\n\r\nThere are certain other elements that enter at times into the\r\ncomposition of porcelain--magnesia, which may have been added to the\r\npaste in the form either of steatite or magnesite; and lime, derived\r\neither from gypsum or chalk. These additions generally tend to increase\r\nthe fusibility of the paste, especially when accompanied by an\r\nadditional dose of silica; but as their presence is not essential we are\r\nnot concerned with these substances here.\r\n\r\nThe glazes used for porcelain are as a rule distinguished by their\r\ncomparative infusibility and by their containing no lead. The\r\ncomposition of these glazes follows more or less that of the paste that\r\nthey cover, with such modifications, however, as to allow of a somewhat\r\nlower fusing-point: as in the case of the paste, there is a harder and\r\nmore refractory, and a softer and more fusible, type. The harder glazes\r\nare composed essentially of felspar, with the addition in most cases of\r\nsilica, kaolin, and powdered fragments of porcelain. At Sèvres, a\r\nnatural rock, pegmatite, consisting chiefly of felspar, has been melted\r\nto form a glaze without further addition. Of late years, however, the\r\nintroduction of a milder type of porcelain has necessitated the use of a\r\nmore fusible glaze, containing a considerable quantity of lime, and it\r\nis a glaze of this latter type that has with few exceptions found favour\r\nin other districts where porcelain is made.\r\n\r\nWe have attempted in this chapter to give some idea of the nature of\r\nporcelain from a physical and chemical point of view, and in doing so\r\nhave taken as our type the hard, refractory paste of Europe. When we\r\ncome to describe the porcelain of the Chinese, we shall notice some\r\nimportant divergences from this type. We say nothing here of the\r\nsoft-paste porcelains, seeing that so long as we confine ourselves to\r\nthe question of chemical composition and physical properties, they lie\r\nentirely outside our definitions. It is only from the point of view of\r\nits history and of its artistic qualities that this group has any claim\r\nto the name of porcelain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE MATERIALS: MIXING, FASHIONING, AND FIRING\r\n\r\n\r\nIt would be quite foreign to the scope and object of this book to\r\nattempt to describe in any detail the different processes that come into\r\nplay in the manufacture of a piece of porcelain. There is the less cause\r\nfor any such detailed treatment, inasmuch as the operations involved in\r\nthe preparation of the paste and in the subsequent potting and firing do\r\nnot essentially differ in the case of porcelain from those employed in\r\nthe manufacture of other classes of pottery. The differences are rather\r\nthose of degree--greater care is necessary in the selection of the\r\nmaterials, and these materials must be more finely ground and more\r\nintimately mixed. Again, the great heat required in the kilns\r\nnecessitates, in the firing of porcelain, many precautions that are not\r\ncalled for in the case of earthenware or fayence. Without, however, some\r\nslight acquaintance with the processes of the manufacture, it would be\r\nimpossible to avoid an amateurish and somewhat ‘anecdotal’ treatment of\r\nour subject. There are, indeed, many intimate features, many delicate\r\nshades of difference that distinguish the wares of various times and\r\nplaces, both in Europe and in the East, which can only be rationally\r\nexplained by reference to the details of the manufacture.\r\n\r\nAt the present day there is only one district in Europe where true\r\nporcelain is manufactured on a large scale. This district lies on the\r\nwestern and south-western border of the central granitic plateau of\r\nFrance, especially in the Limousin and in Berry. Again at Sèvres, for\r\nthe last hundred years and more, a succession of able chemists has\r\ncarried on a series of experiments on the composition and preparation of\r\nporcelain. It is no wonder, then, if we find that the literature\r\nconcerned with these practical departments is almost entirely French.\r\nOne result of this is a greater richness in technical terms than with\r\nus. We find in France names for the various implements and processes of\r\nthe potter’s art, that are something better than the workshop terms of\r\nthe local potter. Again, the little that has been written in England\r\nupon the technology of pottery has been concerned chiefly with\r\nearthenware of Staffordshire.[6]\r\n\r\nAs for the English soft-paste porcelain of the eighteenth century, there\r\nis a remarkable dearth of information both as to its composition and as\r\nto its manufacture. We know in fact in much greater detail how the great\r\npotteries at King-te-chen were carried on at the same period, thanks to\r\nthe letters of the Père D’Entrecolles, and to the information collected\r\nin Dr. Bushell’s great work, _Oriental Ceramic Art_ (New York, 1899. I\r\nshall always quote from the text edition).\r\n\r\nThe following technical notes are based chiefly on the processes in use\r\neither at Sèvres or in the great factories of the Limoges district.[7]\r\nTo begin with the Kaolin, the ‘premier’ element in the composition of\r\nporcelain. The greatest care is taken to procure a pure white clay which\r\nshould approach as near as possible to the more or less theoretical\r\nmineral kaolinite, _i.e._ to a hydrous silicate of alumina. With this\r\nobject the rough china-clay brought from the pit is thrown into a large\r\ntank of water and broken up with wooden spades; the milky liquid is now\r\ndecanted into a second tank, leaving behind most of the quartz and the\r\nother stony particles. On its way the soup-like liquid passes through\r\nthe meshes of a sieve--these may be formed either of brass wire or\r\nsometimes of finely woven silk. On this sieve all but the finest\r\nparticles are retained. The greater part of the kaolin is deposited in\r\nthis second tank, but a certain portion still remains suspended in the\r\nliquid, which is again decanted; the remaining kaolin then settles down\r\nin the third tank, yielding the finest clay. To dry this slimy mass, it\r\nis first forced by hydraulic pumps into canvas bags, and these bags are\r\nthen pressed between fluted wooden trays, strongly clamped together. We\r\nhave now got a white chalky mass which may contain as much as 98 per\r\ncent. of the hydrated silicate of alumina.\r\n\r\nThe other materials, the china-stone[8] and the quartz, have first to be\r\nreduced to the finest powder. To effect this they may, to begin with, be\r\nroasted to effect disintegration, then crushed in a stone-breaking\r\nmachine, and finally passed through the grinding-pan in which they are\r\nground fine between large blocks of chert which rotate upon a pavement\r\nof the same stone. The finely ground materials have now to be mixed in\r\nsuitable proportions either by the old process of ‘slop-blending,’ where\r\nthe different ‘slops,’ each of known specific gravity, are run in due\r\nproportion into the big ‘blending ark,’ or, as is now usual in the case\r\nof fine wares, by weighing out the materials in a dry state. On the\r\nrelative amounts of the three elements, the china-clay, the china-stone,\r\nand the quartz, the nature of the porcelain after firing will depend. M.\r\nVogt (_La Porcelaine_, Paris, 1893) gives a useful table showing the\r\nlimits within which the materials may be varied. We may note that in the\r\ncase of a normal china-stone or petuntse being used instead of felspar,\r\nvery little additional quartz is required. These limits are: kaolin, 35\r\nto 65 per cent.; felspar, 20 to 40 per cent.; and quartz, 15 to 25 per\r\ncent. The larger the percentage of the first material, the harder and\r\nmore refractory will be the resultant porcelain.\r\n\r\nThis question of the composition of the paste has been the subject of\r\nmany experiments lately at Sèvres. A somewhat animated discussion has\r\nraged around it. M. Vogt, who is the director of the technical\r\ndepartment in the National Porcelain Works, is well qualified to speak\r\non the subject. We shall not hesitate then to avail ourselves of the\r\nconclusions which he arrives at, the more so as they put tersely some\r\nimportant points of which we shall see the importance later on. I refer\r\nespecially to the relations of the glazes and the coloured decorations\r\nto the subjacent paste.\r\n\r\nThese are, then, the results that M. Vogt arrives at:--\r\n\r\nThe two extreme types of porcelain, one with 65 per cent. of kaolin and\r\nthe other with only 35 per cent., when taken from the kiln do not differ\r\nin appearance, though one has been subject to a temperature of 1500° C.\r\nto ensure vitrification and the other to only 1350° C. Their physical\r\nproperties, however, are very different. The first, rich in alumina\r\nderived from the excess of kaolin, stands without injury variations of\r\ntemperature, it suits well with a glaze made from felspar, a glaze hard\r\nenough to resist the point of a knife. These are excellent qualities for\r\ndomestic use, but such porcelain does not lend itself well to artistic\r\ndecoration. At the high temperature required in this case in the\r\nfiring, the colours of the paste and of the glazes assume dull and tame\r\nhues, so as to offer little resource to the artist. In a word, in that\r\npart of the decoration that has to be subjected to the full heat of the\r\nkiln, the artist has command only of a restricted and relatively dull\r\npalette. Again, in the decoration of the muffle-stove the vitrifiable\r\nenamels do not become incorporated with the glaze on which they rest. If\r\na decoration in opaque or translucent enamels is attempted, these\r\nenamels are apt to split off, carrying with them a part of the glaze. To\r\nsum up: the porcelain of which the hard paste of Sèvres, introduced by\r\nBrogniart, may be regarded as a type, though excellent for domestic use,\r\nis incapable of receiving a brilliant decoration.\r\n\r\nPorcelain of the second type, more silicious and less aluminous, is\r\nfired at a lower temperature. In order to get a glaze sufficiently\r\nfusible to melt at such a temperature to a fine uniform surface, it is\r\nnecessary to introduce a certain amount of lime into its composition; by\r\nthis the glaze is rendered at the same time a little softer. But now the\r\nlower temperature of the fire will allow of a greater variety and\r\ngreater brilliancy in the colours either combined with or used under the\r\nglaze. When we come to the muffle-fire we can employ enamels of the\r\nwidest range of colour, yielding a brilliant decoration. On the other\r\nhand, this type of porcelain offers less resistance than the other to\r\nthe action of hard bodies and to rapid changes of temperature--enough\r\nresistance, however, so M. Vogt thinks, for all ordinary usages. It is\r\nto this type that the porcelain of China, and Japan, as well as the ‘new\r\nporcelain’ of Sèvres belongs. The latter comes nearer to the porcelain\r\nof the East than any other European ware. Finally, M. Vogt points out\r\nthat most of the other European porcelains, those made in the Limoges\r\ndistrict, in Germany and in Denmark, are of an intermediate type, and\r\nthat they allow the use of either a felspathic or of a calcareous glaze\r\n(Vogt, _La Porcelaine_, pp. 144 _seq._).[9]\r\n\r\nTo return to our raw materials, which we may now suppose to be weighed\r\nout in a dry state in the required proportions. These are once more\r\nthoroughly mixed with water to form the slip or _barbotine_, which is\r\nagain passed through a fine sieve. To remove any particles of iron which\r\nmay have come from the machinery or elsewhere, and which if allowed to\r\nremain would form unsightly stains on the finished ware, it is usual to\r\npass the slip at this stage through a vessel in which a number of\r\nhorse-shoe magnets are suspended. In some of the large French factories\r\na more complicated machine is used for this purpose. The superfluous\r\nwater has now to be removed either by evaporation or by pressure between\r\ncanvas bags in the manner described above. The paste may then be passed\r\nthrough a pug-mill to render it uniform in consistency.\r\n\r\nA curious question arises with regard to the prepared clay. There was\r\nformerly a widespread idea, which may contain an element of truth, that\r\ninstead of handing the clay at once to the potter, it should be kept,\r\nunder certain conditions, for a long space of time that it may undergo a\r\nprocess of ‘aging’ and fermentation. By the ‘aging,’ the working\r\nqualities, especially of a ‘short’ or non-plastic paste (such as that in\r\nuse at Sèvres in the eighteenth century, in making the _pâte tendre_),\r\nwere doubtless increased, the more so when the clay was at intervals\r\nsubjected to fresh kneading and watering. With regard to the long\r\nperiods for which the clay was kept by the Chinese, the most exaggerated\r\nstatements were formerly made. Mr. William Burton is of opinion that\r\nthere may be in some cases an evolution of carbonic acid and\r\nsulphuretted hydrogen when natural plastic clays are used, for these may\r\ncontain both vegetable remains and small quantities of iron pyrites. But\r\nthe change, he thinks, is chiefly a physical one, due to the settling\r\ndown of the mass. Might there not also, I would suggest, be a change of\r\na more intimate nature, due to the formation of gelatinous silica and\r\nperhaps also of fresh alkaline or other silicates, among these minutely\r\ncomminuted particles of various materials now freshly brought together?\r\nWe know very little of the conditions that give to natural clays their\r\npeculiar unctuous quality and their plasticity.\r\n\r\nWe come now to what has been called the ‘shaping’ of the clay, using\r\nthat word as an equivalent to the French _façonnage_ to include all the\r\nprocesses, throwing on the wheel, turning of the lathe, ‘pressing’ and\r\n‘casting,’ by which the desired form is given to the vessel.\r\n\r\nThe POTTER’S WHEEL, perhaps the most ancient of all mechanical\r\ncontrivances, is still largely used in the shaping of porcelain, and\r\nthat, too, in a simple form which differs little from that employed\r\nthree or four thousand years ago in Egypt,[10] and perhaps for nearly as\r\nlong a period in China. From an æsthetic standpoint, the wheel holds the\r\nsame relation to the art of the potter as the brush does to that of the\r\npainter. It is perhaps a just cause of reproach against that branch of\r\nthe ceramic art with which we are now concerned, that so comparatively\r\nlittle use is made of the potter’s wheel. Not only in Europe, but for\r\nlong ages in China also, the use of the wheel, for many classes of\r\nvessels, has been replaced by various processes of moulding. With us,\r\nbut not in the East, a third process, that of ‘casting’ with liquid\r\nslip, is largely used. But when made either by casting or moulding, the\r\nhand of the potter is not seen in the shape of the finished vessel. By\r\nmeans of the wheel alone do we get the full expression of the peculiar\r\nqualities of a plastic material. This was recognised by the Greeks, when\r\nthe potter who made the vase signed his name by the side of the painter\r\nwho decorated it. This it is that gives a certain charm to the roughest\r\nearthenware which we may look for in vain in the most elaborately\r\ndecorated specimen of either Chinese or European porcelain.\r\n\r\nThe clay as it comes from the filter-presses or from the drying-beds is\r\nsubjected to a series of kneading processes to ensure uniformity of\r\ntexture. The last of these is the ‘slapping,’ when the clay is made up\r\ninto hollow balls, and thrown vigorously on to a board until all bubbles\r\nand irregularities of texture are removed.\r\n\r\nThe thrower’s wheel is essentially a revolving vertical spindle, with a\r\nsmall round table at the top, beside which the thrower sits. The clay is\r\nhanded to him in balls, and he throws it upon the whirling table between\r\nhis knees. The table is put into motion either directly by the pressure\r\nof the workman’s foot on a lower table, or by some arrangement of straps\r\nand pedals. If the movement is given by the potter himself, as is still\r\nthe case at Sèvres, and to some extent in China, there is the advantage\r\nthat a more delicate and intimate control of the speed is possible. The\r\nmovement of the clay under the potter’s hand is instinctively regulated\r\nby him. Every one has seen and marvelled at the wonderful process. The\r\nclay is first drawn up into a pillar, and then depressed into a flat\r\ncake, so that the circular arrangement of the particles may spread\r\nthrough the whole mass. The thrower then opens the hollow of the vessel\r\nwith his thumbs, and proceeds to give it the desired shape, moistening\r\nhis hands at intervals by dipping them into the slip. Small pieces are\r\nshaped between the thumb and first finger, either of one or of both\r\nhands. For larger pieces the whole hand and wrist is called into play,\r\nwith the assistance, it may be, of a sponge. Still larger vessels are\r\nbuilt up by piling on to the circular edge as it revolves strips of the\r\nclay. Delicacy of hand is of the greatest importance--the pressure\r\napplied and the movements of the fingers must be regulated by the nature\r\nof the clay, and especially by its greater or lesser plasticity. It is\r\nessential that the workman should not only press evenly and steadily on\r\nthe clay as it rises, but that the speed of the rotation should have a\r\ndefinite relation to the rate at which he raises his hands. With a ‘fat’\r\nor unctuous clay especially any irregularity of pressure will betray\r\nitself, and the marks will be more prominent after firing. This is the\r\norigin of the spiral ridges that we often see on the surface not only of\r\ncommon earthenware, but sometimes of high-class porcelain. To this cause\r\nare due the rings so characteristic of Plymouth porcelain; this\r\n‘wreathing’ or ‘_vissage_’ is sometimes seen on Chinese porcelain also.\r\n\r\nWhen the thrower has finished his vessel, it is cut off from the table\r\nby a piece of thread or by a brass wire, and taken to the stoveroom to\r\ndry and harden. When sufficiently dry the vessel is placed on a lathe,\r\nand the turner shaves off all superfluous clay. The finer mouldings\r\n(using the word here in its architectural sense) may also be given at\r\nthis stage, and sometimes the surface is shaped by a ‘profile’ of steel\r\n(it may be a piece from the blade of an old saw), which cuts the\r\nsurface down to the desired shape. The shavings are carefully preserved\r\nand returned to the slip-house, to be blended with the new clay, the\r\nworking qualities of which are thereby improved.\r\n\r\nThere are certain parts, especially handles, spouts, and projecting\r\nornaments, which must in all cases be separately moulded. The foot also,\r\nin the case of large vases, is separately prepared and subsequently\r\nattached. These parts are made in plaster moulds by the ‘handler,’ whose\r\nduty it now is to fix them to the vase. Carefully marking the exact\r\nplace, he spreads on it a thin layer of slip with a spatula, and then\r\npresses home the handle or other appendage. Should, however, the two\r\nsurfaces be dry and absorbent, it may be necessary to add some gum to\r\nthe slip thus employed. A similar process, but one requiring greater\r\ncare and skill, is that of fixing together the separate pieces of large\r\nvases and figures. This is done in the way we have already described in\r\nthe case of the handles and spouts--that is by applying a coating of\r\nslip to the parts to be joined.\r\n\r\nIt is at this stage that any decorations in relief that may be required\r\nare applied to the surface. These are often made in flat moulds, and to\r\nfix them it is enough to run a little water from a camel’s hair pencil\r\nbehind the ornament after adjusting it to its proper place. These\r\nprocesses of fitting on of appendages and ornaments are included by the\r\nFrench under the term _garniture_.\r\n\r\nMOULDING AND PRESSING.--It is evident that only vessels of a cylindrical\r\nor conical form, or, more exactly, such as have a circular section when\r\ndivided horizontally, can be formed on the wheel. To produce any other\r\nform, the vessel must be either shaped directly by the hand or made in\r\nsome kind of mould. The use of moulds for pottery is as old, if not\r\nolder than that of the wheel. It was in this way that the _Ushabti_\r\nfigures of the old Egyptians were made, and many of these date back to\r\nthe Early Empire. So in China, the further back we go, the more the use\r\nof moulds seems to have prevailed. I take from the excellent article on\r\nthe manufacture of pottery in the _Penny Cyclopædia_ the following\r\naccount of the process in use in England at the beginning of the last\r\ncentury:--\r\n\r\n‘The mould is made in two parts, and each is separately filled by laying\r\nin a cake of clay which has been beaten out to the proper thickness on a\r\nwet plaster-block; it is pressed into the mould by repeated blows from a\r\nball of wet sponge, then squeezed into all the angular parts and\r\nsmoothed with sponge, wet leather, and horn. When both sides of the\r\nmoulds are thus lined with clay, they are joined together, and the man\r\nlays a roll of clay along the inside of the joining, which he works down\r\nuntil the whole is smooth and solid.’ The mould is then carried into a\r\nstoveroom, and the plaster here absorbs the moisture so as to release\r\nthe clay. The contents are carefully taken out, and the empty mould\r\nreturned to the stove previous to being filled again. The seam that\r\nremains on the outside of vessels after fitting the two parts\r\ntogether[11] is removed by scraping and burnishing with wet horn; the\r\nhandles and other appendages are then attached.\r\n\r\nThis is the process that is called ‘hollow-ware pressing’ or\r\n‘squeezing.’ In ‘flat-ware pressing’ the mould is used to give the shape\r\nto the inside of the vessel only. The mould is placed on the extremity\r\nof the ‘whirler,’ a vertical revolving spindle provided with a circular\r\ntable, similar to that of the thrower’s wheel. The plate-maker takes a\r\ncake of clay, which he has previously flattened out with his ‘batter,’\r\nplaces it on the mould, and presses down with his hand. The upper\r\nsurface of the cake of clay (what will ultimately be the bottom of the\r\nplate) is now shaped by an earthenware ‘profile.’ The mould is now taken\r\noff the whirler and at once replaced by another. Flat-ware, especially\r\nwhen greater finish is required, is also made in a double mould, and the\r\nclay may then be first thrown on the wheel so as to approximate to the\r\nshape required before being placed in the mould.\r\n\r\nProcesses very similar to the hollow and flat-ware pressing are largely\r\nused by the Chinese. Dr. Bushell has unearthed a passage from a\r\ntechnical work, written in the time of the Chou dynasty, more than two\r\nthousand years ago, in which a distinction is made between the ordinary\r\npotters who worked with the wheel, and the moulders who made oblong\r\nbowls and sacrificial dishes. In a somewhat later work (19-90 A.D.) the\r\nwriter notes both the advantage resulting from regularity of size, and\r\nthe obstacles arising from the shrinkage of the parts in firing, when\r\nvessels are made in moulds.[12]\r\n\r\nCASTING.--There is yet another process which is largely resorted to in\r\nEuropean works, but which appears to be unknown to the Chinese. It\r\ndepends upon the rapidity with which dry plaster of Paris will absorb\r\nthe water from a slip of creamy consistency, without allowing any of the\r\nsolid particles to pass along with the water absorbed. The slip-mixture\r\nis poured into the plaster mould, which at once absorbs the water,\r\nleaving a uniform deposit upon the surface of the mould. After pouring\r\nor otherwise drawing off the water, a second and thicker slip may be\r\nadded so as to form a second layer. The paste of the porcelain so\r\nprepared is likely to be of a lighter and more porous consistency than\r\nwhen made by throwing or pressing. This process was used in the\r\neighteenth century at Derby, and doubtless elsewhere, and it was\r\npreferred to moulding for making statuettes. Some account of it is given\r\nby Haslem, a good practical authority, in his _Old Derby China_. For\r\nsmall objects, ‘casting’ has long been employed in France, and more\r\nlately Ebelmen and Regnault have so improved the process, that vessels\r\nof all shapes and dimensions are made by it. This has been rendered\r\npossible by the introduction of compressed air into the interior of the\r\nvessel, by which means the paste is kept in position until it is\r\nsufficiently dry to support itself. A still better way of doing this is\r\nto exhaust the air _on the outside_, by placing the mould in an\r\nair-pump; the upper part can then be left open, and the whole operation\r\nis under the eye of the workman. M. Vogt (_La Porcelaine_, pp. 157\r\n_seq._) laments that in France the increased use of these mechanical\r\nprocesses had so reduced the demand for skilful potters, that the race\r\nis nearly extinct.\r\n\r\nFIRING AND FURNACES.--So far in our treatment of the operations involved\r\nin the manufacture of porcelain, the same general description has been\r\napplicable, with trifling exceptions, to the processes in use both in\r\nEurope and in the far East, and to soft as well as to hard paste. But\r\nnow that we have to describe the firing of the ware, a division into\r\nthree classes is necessary:--\r\n\r\n1st. The Chinese system. This is the simplest plan. The glaze is applied\r\nat once to the air-dried ware, which is then subjected to but one\r\nfiring--that of the ‘_grand feu_.’\r\n\r\n2nd. The French system for hard paste. The unglazed vessel is exposed to\r\na heat varying from dull to full red, generally in the dome over the\r\nmain body of the furnace. It is then glazed, and again fired to the full\r\npoint required by the paste. This is essentially a French process, and\r\nthe preliminary fire is known as the _feu dégourdi_.\r\n\r\n3rd. The English system used for bone pastes. In this case it is the\r\nfirst firing that is the most severe. The ‘biscuit oven,’ therefore, in\r\nwhich this is effected, must not be confused with the _feu dégourdi_\r\njust mentioned. After dipping, the ware is heated again in the ‘glozing’\r\nor glazing oven, but only to a temperature sufficient to melt the glaze.\r\n\r\nIn the case of ware decorated with enamel colours over the glaze, there\r\nwill be required in all these cases one or more additional firings at\r\ncomparatively low temperatures in the muffle-stove.\r\n\r\nThe furnaces, ovens, or kilns in which porcelain is fired are always of\r\nthe reverberatory type; that is to say, the fuel is burned in a separate\r\nchamber or fireplace, and the products of combustion pass over or among\r\nthe ware that is being fired. Such furnaces differ on the one hand from\r\nthe arrangement in a blast furnace, or that often used in the burning of\r\nbricks, where the fuel is mixed with the material to be heated, and on\r\nthe other hand from the muffle-stove, where the object exposed to the\r\nheat is protected from the direct flame by the box of fireclay or iron\r\nin which it is placed.\r\n\r\nKilns of many shapes and sizes have been used for firing porcelain, but\r\nthey may most of them be included in one or the other of the following\r\nbroad classes.\r\n\r\n1st. The old bee-hive ovens of China, the use of which appears to have\r\nbeen abandoned in that country by the end of the seventeenth century.\r\nThese ovens were generally small, in some cases only holding one vase. A\r\nrow of them may be heated from one fireplace, and they are then built on\r\na rising slope. This type has survived to the present day in Japan.\r\n\r\n2nd. The oblong horizontal furnaces, often of considerable dimensions,\r\nused during the present dynasty in China. They resemble in section the\r\nordinary type of reverberatory furnace found in metallurgical works. A\r\nvery similar form was long employed at Meissen.\r\n\r\n3rd. The large conical furnaces, now in general use in the porcelain\r\nfactories of Europe. They may be heated by either direct or by reversed\r\nflame.[13]\r\n\r\nIn China the fuel is generally pinewood, in billets of uniform size. In\r\nmany European kilns wood is still used: birchwood, cut in lengths of\r\nfifteen to twenty inches, is the only fuel used at the present day at\r\nSèvres. In England, however, the difficulties attendant on the use of\r\ncoal appear to have been overcome.\r\n\r\nThe reader will find in the third volume of Brongniart’s great work\r\n(_Traité des Arts Céramiques_, Paris, 1877) several plates giving plans\r\nand sections of all these types of furnaces. From a careful examination\r\nof these engravings more is to be learned than from any amount of verbal\r\ndescription. A thorough grasp of the process of firing is of the\r\ngreatest assistance in understanding the problems and difficulties that\r\narise in the manufacture of porcelain, and we shall have to return to\r\nthe subject when we come to treat of the several wares.\r\n\r\nWhatever differences there may be in the shape of the furnaces, when it\r\ncomes to filling the interior with the ware to be baked, there is one\r\nprecaution which has been adopted in nearly every country.[14] The ware\r\nmust be protected from the direct heat of the flame by means of a case\r\nof fireclay in which it is placed. These are the seggars (French\r\n_cassettes_; the process of filling and arranging them is called\r\n_encastage_), to the preparation of which so important a department has\r\nto be set apart in all porcelain works, and whose manufacture adds so\r\nmuch to the working expenses.\r\n\r\nThe seggar proper is a cylindrical pan of fireclay, in shape and size\r\nlike a hatbox. They are piled, in the furnace, one over the other, and\r\nthese piles or ‘bungs’ are arranged in the furnace so as to allow a\r\nfree circulation of the hot gases between them, but otherwise they are\r\npacked as closely together as possible. These seggars may be used\r\nseveral times over. When broken, the fragments are ground up and mixed\r\nwith fresh fireclay or _argile-plastique_ to form new cases--without\r\nthis addition the clay would be too plastic or ‘fat’ for the purpose.\r\nThe greatest precautions are taken in the packing of the seggars in the\r\nfurnace. The giving way of one pile from any inaccuracy in the\r\narrangement may destroy the contents of the whole oven. So again\r\ninfinite care must be taken in the arrangement and support of the\r\nobjects in each seggar. The bottom is covered with ground flint or other\r\ninfusible material, and the vessel is supported, when necessary, by\r\nvarious forms of struts, props, or crow-claws, which sometimes leave\r\ntheir mark on the base or side of the finished object. In spite of these\r\nprecautions, a large quantity of defective pieces or ‘wasters’ are\r\nproduced in all works, and these are usually cast aside. The finding of\r\nsuch fragments in after days is sometimes the only proof we have that\r\nporcelain or pottery has formerly been made at the spot. But the proof\r\nis final, for defective pieces and ‘crow-claws’ are not objects likely\r\nto have been imported from a distance. Again, the indelible marks left\r\non the porcelain, either on the edge which rested directly on the seggar\r\nor at the points where the object was supported by the crow-claws, often\r\ngive valuable hints as to the _provenance_ of the piece in question.[15]\r\nIn the case of valuable wares these rough edges and marks are removed as\r\nfar as possible by grinding on a small wheel, and then polishing the\r\nsurface with pumice or with putty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nGLAZES\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore attacking the somewhat complicated subject of the nature and\r\ncomposition of glazes, it will be well to take up again the thread of\r\nthe mechanical processes that are involved in the making of a piece of\r\nporcelain.\r\n\r\nThe materials that enter into the glaze are reduced to the finest powder\r\nin mills similar to those in which the china-stone and flint are ground\r\nfor the preparation of the paste. If any substance soluble in water,\r\nsuch as borax or salts of the alkalis, enter into the composition of the\r\nglaze, these must be first partially fused in combination with the other\r\nmaterials to form a _frit_, a kind of imperfect glass. These frits,\r\nwhich enter so largely into the composition of soft-paste porcelain, are\r\nformed with the object of bringing the soluble constituents into an\r\ninsoluble form before mixing with water to form the slip. There are\r\nindeed other practical reasons that render a preliminary partial fusion\r\ndesirable.\r\n\r\nThe finely ground elements of the glaze, mixed in due proportion, are\r\nworked up with water to form a creamlike slip into which the vessel to\r\nbe glazed is now dipped. In China, in many cases, the glaze-slip is\r\nblown upon the surface in the form of a spray. This is done by means of\r\na bamboo tube, covered at one end by a piece of silk gauze, through\r\nwhich the liquid is projected by the breath of the operator (French,\r\n_insufflation_); in other cases the glaze may be painted on with a\r\nbrush. In China, as we have mentioned, the glaze-slip is generally\r\napplied to the raw surface of the thoroughly dried but unbaked ware, but\r\nin other countries there is, almost without exception, a preliminary\r\nfiring of greater or less degree to produce a biscuit.\r\n\r\nWe shall restrict the use of the word glaze to the vitreous coating\r\napplied directly to the surface of the raw paste or of the biscuit to\r\nenhance the decorative effect of the ware, and with the more prosaic\r\nobject of allowing the surface to be easily kept clean. In the case of\r\nporcelain this coating is always more or less transparent.[16] There is\r\nhere no necessity for concealing the natural white colour of the paste.\r\nIn the case of many kinds of pottery, however, as in the ‘enamelled\r\nfayence’ of Delft and Italy, the glaze is rendered opaque by the\r\naddition of oxide of tin, so that the ill-favoured ground is concealed\r\nby a white shiny surface which may be made to resemble closely the\r\nnatural surface of porcelain. A glaze of this kind is often called an\r\nenamel, but as we are not concerned with such an expedient we shall\r\nconfine the use of that word to the various forms in which a vitreous\r\ndecoration, whether translucent or opaque, is _superimposed upon the\r\nglaze_ and fused into it, more or less thoroughly, by a subsequent\r\nfiring in a muffle furnace.\r\n\r\nThe English word ‘glaze’ is only another form of the word ‘glass,’ and\r\nwe may say at once that, in composition at least, there is often little\r\ndifference between the two substances. The French word for ‘glaze’ is\r\n_couverte_ or _vernis_; the last term applies well to the thin skin of\r\nglaze found on Greek pottery. The Chinese have several expressions, but\r\nit is a curious fact that the characters with which most of these terms\r\nare written contain the radical for ‘oil,’ and indeed the word ‘oil’\r\nitself is often used in the sense of ‘glaze.’\r\n\r\nMr. Rix puts it well when he says that the glaze is to the enameller of\r\nporcelain what his canvas is to the painter; while in the case of a\r\ndecoration ‘_sous couverte_,’ the glaze corresponds to the varnish\r\nwhich, while protecting his work, gives brilliancy to the colouring\r\n(_Journal of Society of Arts_, vol. xli.). It is, moreover, the vehicle\r\nby which the design is harmonised and rendered mellow. The effect is\r\nproduced at once and endures practically for all time.\r\n\r\nThe hardness and fusibility of glazes differ widely, and they are\r\nconditioned by the nature of the wares that they cover. It is evident\r\nthat there must be a close relation between the fusing-points of paste\r\nand glaze, and that the latter should be the more fusible of the two.\r\nThe difference of melting-point should, however, not be too great. The\r\nmelted glaze should rather, by penetrating into the already softened\r\npaste or by a chemical action upon its surface, form a more or less\r\nuniform mass with it. In cooling, the contraction of the glaze should\r\nfollow that of the subjacent paste. This is a most important point; any\r\ndiscordance may lead to splitting, cracking, and ‘crazing.’\r\n\r\nThe beauty of the surface of porcelain depends on the fact that the\r\nglaze has become intimately united with the paste during the long\r\nexposure of both to a high temperature. We should not be conscious, in\r\nregarding a fine specimen of porcelain, of a greater or less thickness\r\nof glass covering an opaque substance; we should rather see in it the\r\npolished surface of ivory or of some precious marble.\r\n\r\nIt would seem that it was the beauty of the glassy surface, enhancing\r\nthe brilliancy of the colouring, rather than any practical advantage\r\nconnected with its use, that first led to the application of glaze to\r\npottery. The turquoise and green glazes of the Egyptians (the colour is\r\nderived from a silicate of copper along with soda and sometimes lime)\r\nwere known to the men of the Early Empire. They were applied to a\r\nfritlike mass of sand held together by silicate of soda, to which the\r\nname of porcelain has sometimes been very wrongly given. Objects of\r\nsteatite, of slate, and even of rock crystal were sometimes covered with\r\na coloured glaze of this kind, but it was never applied to the clay\r\nvessels in daily use. These were made, then as now, from the unctuous\r\nclay of the Nile bank. For this restriction there was a very good\r\nreason, namely that a glaze of this nature, composed chiefly of alkaline\r\nsilicates, will not adhere to a base of ordinary clay. It was not until\r\nPtolemaic and Roman times that, by the discovery or adoption of a glaze\r\ncontaining lead, the ancients were enabled to glaze their pottery. So in\r\nAssyria, the employment of glazes was almost confined to the decoration\r\nof the surface of brickwork, the bricks being of a loose and somewhat\r\nsandy texture.[17]\r\n\r\nIn these glazes, and indeed in much earlier examples from Babylonia,\r\nboth tin and lead have been found. The respective virtues of the\r\nsilicates of these metals were doubtless appreciated, that of tin to\r\nform a white opaque enamel hiding the material below, and that of lead\r\nto enable the glaze into which it enters to adhere to a paste formed of\r\na plastic clay.\r\n\r\nWith the Chinese the aim was rather æsthetic than practical. They sought\r\nby means of the marvellous glazes that cover their ancient porcelain to\r\nimitate the surface of natural stones; their early celadons were in a\r\nmeasure intended to take the place of the precious green jade, so highly\r\nesteemed by them.\r\n\r\nAt the time when the manufacture of porcelain was first introduced from\r\nChina there were (apart from the salt-glazed stoneware, which lies quite\r\noutside our inquiry) three classes of glaze in general use either in\r\nEurope or in the nearer East:--\r\n\r\n1. Glazes consisting essentially of alkaline silicates without either\r\nlead or tin. Such glazes could only be applied to a fritty silicious\r\nbase, and in India and Persia their employment seems to have been a\r\nsurvival from Egyptian and Assyrian times.[18]\r\n\r\n2. Opaque enamel glazes, the opacity being due to the presence of tin; a\r\nconsiderable amount of lead also is generally found in these glazes. We\r\nare not concerned here with the obscure origin of this group, but in the\r\nsixteenth century this enamelled fayence was in general use for the\r\nbetter class of table-ware. It includes the Italian majolica, the French\r\nfayence of Nevers and Rouen, and above all the earthenware of Delft.\r\n\r\n3. The oily-looking lead glazes with which the common earthenwares were\r\ncovered. These were essentially the glazes of the Middle Ages in Europe,\r\nand their employment could probably be traced back to the lead-glazed\r\nware sparingly used by the Romans. We have already noticed the use of a\r\nsimilar glaze in Egypt as far back probably as Ptolemaic times.\r\n\r\nThere were practical objections to all these glazes. It is true that at\r\nDelft, by the use of the tin enamel, a ware could be turned out closely\r\nresembling, in external aspect, the blue and white porcelain of China,\r\nbut the enamel was soft and would in time chip off at the edges, showing\r\nthe dark earthy clay beneath. On the other hand, the alkaline glazes of\r\nthe East were not much known in Europe; they can only be used upon a\r\nvery tender and treacherous base. In India and Persia, however, a ware\r\nthus glazed still competes with the hard porcelain of the Far East. In\r\nspite of the great objections to the glazes of our third class, those\r\ncontaining lead--objections arising from their softness and from the\r\ndanger of poisoning to those employed in their manufacture--their use\r\nhas tended rather to increase. Not only is lead the principal\r\nconstituent of the glazes still universally used for common pottery, but\r\nit forms an important element in the glaze of our finer earthenwares as\r\nwell as in that of those bone pastes which rank with us as porcelain.\r\n\r\nThe glaze which had been brought to perfection by the Chinese at an\r\nearly period differs from all those yet mentioned by its hardness, its\r\nhigh fusing-point, and in its chemical composition. Speaking generally,\r\nthe glaze of porcelain differs in composition from the paste which it\r\ncovers only sufficiently to allow of its becoming completely liquid at\r\nthe extreme heat of the furnace; and just as the paste of Chinese\r\nporcelain has a wider limit of variability than that made in Europe, but\r\nis on the whole of a ‘milder’ type than the latter, so we find that\r\nwhile the glazes of the Chinese are as a whole less refractory and not\r\nquite so hard, there is still a wide range of variation in these\r\nqualities.\r\n\r\nIf, then, we theoretically regard porcelain as a compound of a silicate\r\nof alumina with an alkaline silicate of the same base, we may say that\r\nthe glaze of porcelain is formed by the latter body alone, that it is,\r\nin fact, merely a fused felspar. But as in the case of the paste, so in\r\nthe glaze there is generally present an excess of silica, derived from\r\nthe quartz contained in the petuntse or pegmatite, and this silica\r\nenters into combination with some other bases which are present in the\r\nconstituents of the glaze, thereby increasing its fusibility and\r\nmodifying the contraction in cooling. The most important of these\r\nadditional bases is lime, so that the more fusible type may be called a\r\ncalcareous, as opposed to a more refractory or purely felspathic glaze.\r\nAs much as 21 per cent. of lime has been found in some Chinese glazes,\r\nthe amount of alumina being proportionately reduced.\r\n\r\nThere is more or less lime in the glaze of most kinds of European hard\r\nporcelain, but the exceptionally hard and refractory paste made at\r\nSèvres since the time of Brongniart is covered by a glaze of\r\ncorresponding hardness from which that earth is absent. This hard paste\r\nhas, however, of late been replaced in part by one of a milder type, and\r\nwith this latter a calcareous glaze has been adopted even at Sèvres, the\r\nobject of the change being, as we have said, to allow of a more\r\nbrilliant decoration.\r\n\r\nThere is a perceptible difference in the aspect of these two types of\r\nglazes after firing. The hard, non-calcareous glaze has a slightly milky\r\nlook. The softer calcareous type is more brilliant, and approaches in\r\ntransparence and limpidity to the lead glazes of soft porcelain. A glaze\r\nof this last kind was used at Sèvres for a few years after the first\r\nintroduction of the hard paste, and perhaps also at Dresden in quite\r\nearly days.\r\n\r\nThe principal objection to a hard refractory glaze, such as that so long\r\nin use at Sèvres, arises from the difficulty of properly incorporating\r\nthe enamel colours with its body. The restriction of the number of\r\npigments that can be employed, both under and on the surface of the\r\nglaze, in consequence of the high temperature at which the latter melts,\r\nis another drawback. The dulness, the ‘painted on’ look of so much of\r\nthe decoration on European hard paste porcelain, is in great measure a\r\nconsequence of the employment of a glaze that is only softened at a high\r\ntemperature. As an example of a medium type of glaze we give the\r\ncomposition of that used at Berlin in 1836. This consisted of kaolin, 31\r\nper cent.; quartz, 43 per cent.; gypsum, 14 per cent.; and ground\r\nporcelain, 12 per cent. A glaze long in use at Dresden is of a very\r\nsimilar character. Felspar, it will be seen, does not enter into its\r\ncomposition, and such a glaze can contain but little potash or soda.\r\nWith this we may contrast the hard glaze of Sèvres, composed simply of\r\nground pegmatite, a rock consisting mainly of felspar. This glaze yields\r\non analysis 74 per cent. of silica, 17 per cent. of alumina, and as much\r\nas 8 per cent. of potash.\r\n\r\nThe glaze on Chinese porcelain is prepared by mixing certain special\r\nvarieties of petuntse with an impure lime, prepared by burning limestone\r\nwith dry fern as fuel. It contains, as we have seen, from 15 to 21 per\r\ncent. of lime, 5 to 6 per cent. of alkalis, 11 per cent. of alumina, and\r\n66 per cent. of silica.\r\n\r\nWe give these examples to illustrate the principal types of glazes used\r\nfor hard paste porcelain. It will be noticed that the constituents are\r\ndrawn from widely different sources.\r\n\r\nThe glazes of soft paste porcelain always contain a large amount both of\r\nlead and of potash or soda, so that they approximate in composition to a\r\nflint glass. The alkalis, generally introduced as carbonates,\r\nnecessitate a previous fritting of part at least of the materials.\r\nBoracic acid plays an important part in the glaze of most modern English\r\nwares: it is generally introduced in the form of borate of soda or\r\nborax. This acid replaces in part the silica, just as in the paste the\r\nglassy materials are replaced by bone-earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nDECORATION BY MEANS OF COLOUR\r\n\r\n\r\nIf we were treating the subject purely from a practical point of view,\r\nwith the glazing and firing of a piece of porcelain the manufacture\r\nmight be held to be terminated. This would be strictly true, for\r\ninstance, of the white porcelain of Berlin, so largely used in the\r\nchemical laboratory; a great deal, too, of the china in domestic use\r\nreceives no decoration of any kind. But for us there remains still to\r\nexamine the element of colour and the way in which it is applied to the\r\ndecoration of porcelain.\r\n\r\nThis is effected in three different ways: by the employment of coloured\r\nglazes; by painting on the surface of the paste before the glaze is\r\napplied (this is the decoration _sous couverte_); and finally by\r\ncoloured enamels applied to the surface of the glaze. These methods may\r\nbe combined, but as this is rarely the case, such a division forms the\r\nbasis of a convenient classification, more especially for the wares of\r\nChina and Japan.\r\n\r\nIn the case of both the paste and of the glaze, we have been dealing\r\nwith a restricted group of elements, with alumina, lime, potash and\r\nsoda; and apart from impurities unintentionally introduced, all the\r\ncombinations of these bodies are colourless. We have now to consider the\r\neffect of introducing certain of the heavy metallic bases which combine\r\nwith the excess of silica to form coloured silicates.\r\n\r\nThe metals that give to Oriental porcelain its brilliant hues are few in\r\nnumber. Indeed, in all lands and at all times, iron, copper, cobalt, and\r\nmanganese have been the principal sources of colour in the decoration\r\nnot only of porcelain, but of most other kinds of pottery. As equal to\r\nthese four metals in importance, but not strictly to be classed as\r\ncolouring materials, we may place tin, the source of most opaque whites,\r\nand lead, which is the main fluxing element for our enamels. Next in\r\nimportance to these metals come antimony, long known to the Chinese as a\r\nsource of yellow, and finally, but this last only since the beginning of\r\nthe eighteenth century, gold, as the source of a red pigment.[19] This\r\nexhausts the list, not only for the Far East, but for all the pottery of\r\nEurope up to the end of the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\nIt was in a period of artistic decline that the advance of chemical\r\nknowledge led to the introduction of other colours, derived both from\r\nnew metallic bases and from fresh combinations of those already known.\r\nBy far the most important of these new colours are those derived from\r\nthe salts of chromium, but uranium and other rare metals have also been\r\ncalled into use. As with the sister art of painting, the beauty and\r\nharmony of the effects produced have not kept pace with the enlargement\r\nof the palette--the result was rather to accentuate the decline that had\r\nalready set in from other causes.\r\n\r\nThere are two metals, iron and copper, that have always been of\r\npre-eminent importance as sources of colour. Each of them forms two\r\nseries of combinations differing entirely in hue, so that were we\r\nconfined to the use of these two metals, our palette would still be a\r\nfairly complete one.\r\n\r\nThe protoxide of copper, especially when a certain amount of lime and\r\nof soda is present, forms a series of beautiful blue and green\r\nsilicates. When the proportion of oxygen is decreased, as happens when\r\nthe surface of the ware is exposed in the kiln to a reducing flame, a\r\nsuboxide of copper is formed, which gives a deep and more or less opaque\r\nred hue to the glaze. So in the case of iron, the so-called sesqui-oxide\r\nis perhaps the most abundant source of colouring matter in the mineral\r\nkingdom: the colours produced by it range from pale yellow to orange,\r\nbrown, and full red. When, however, the iron is present as a protoxide,\r\nthe colour given to the glaze is entirely altered; it ranges from a pale\r\nsea-green to a deep olive.\r\n\r\nThe remaining two elements that have long played an important part in\r\nthe decoration of pottery are cobalt and manganese. These metals, in the\r\nform of silicates, yield the well-known series of blues and purples. One\r\nimportant source of the famous underglaze blue of China and Japan is a\r\nblack mineral known to us as wad, which occurs in earthy to stony\r\nconcretions. This wad contains oxides of both cobalt and manganese, and\r\nthe quality of the blue obtained from it depends in great measure upon\r\nthe proportion in which the two metals occur.\r\n\r\nThe employment of antimony is comparatively rare, but, generally in\r\ncombination with iron, it is an important source of yellow. In spite of\r\nthe volatile nature of most of its salts, in the presence of silica this\r\nmetal is able to withstand a high temperature.\r\n\r\nBut before considering the application of colour to the glaze, we must\r\nmention briefly a method of decoration which was in great favour at\r\nSèvres some years ago--I mean the application of colour to the paste\r\nitself. This was done long ago by Wedgwood, sometimes to the whole mass\r\nof the paste, as was the case with his jasper ware, which some\r\nauthorities class as a true porcelain. At Sèvres these coloured pastes\r\nhave been generally applied to the surface only, in thin layers, or even\r\nas mere coats of paint. When laid on in successive coats, as in the\r\nso-called _pâte-sur-pâte_, the amount of colouring matter need not be\r\nlarge, from 2 to 5 per cent. When larger proportions of coloured oxides\r\nare mixed with the _pâte_, and this is painted on with a brush, the\r\nprocess differs little from the ordinary decoration under the glaze,\r\ninto which it indeed may be said to pass. Coloured pastes of this\r\ndescription have never been employed by the Chinese, and it is not\r\npossible to obtain much brilliancy or decorative effect by their use.\r\nThey are, indeed, foreign to the nature of porcelain, sacrificing the\r\nbrilliant white ground which should be the basis of all decorative\r\nschemes.\r\n\r\nWhen the colouring matter is subjacent to the glaze it must be of a\r\nnature to withstand the full heat of the subsequent firing; we are\r\nrestricted therefore to colours ‘_à grand feu_.’ This practically\r\nconfines us to cobalt and to certain combinations of iron and copper, as\r\nfar as the ‘old palette’ is concerned. At Sèvres and elsewhere other\r\nmetals have been made use of whose silicates withstand the extreme\r\ntemperature of the kiln. By the use of chromium we have command of many\r\nshades of green. If to an oxide of tin we add a minute quantity of the\r\nsesqui-oxide of chromium, we can obtain, in the presence of lime, many\r\nshades from rose to purple; and a mixture of cobalt and chromium\r\nproduces a fine black. There is, however, as yet no satisfactory yellow\r\npigment known that will withstand the _grand feu_. At the best we can\r\nget a straw colour from certain ores of tungsten and titanium, and from\r\nuranium a yellow deeper in tint but uncertain in application.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the colours we have mentioned require a more or less\r\noxidising flame for their full development. There are, however, two most\r\nimportant groups of coloured glazes, long the monopoly of the Chinese,\r\nbut now successfully imitated in France and elsewhere, which require,\r\nfor a term at least, to be subjected to a reducing flame.\r\n\r\nThe first of these glazes is the well-known CELADON, using that term in\r\nits proper and restricted sense, for certain shades of greyish green.\r\nThe celadon of the Chinese is produced by the presence of a small\r\nquantity, about two per cent., of protoxide of iron in the glaze. An\r\noxidising flame would change this protoxide to the yellow sesqui-oxide.\r\nWe may note that a celadon of good tint can only be produced when a\r\nconsiderable quantity of lime is present in the glaze.\r\n\r\nThe other group, depending also upon a reducing flame, is constituted by\r\nthe famous SANG DE BŒUF and FLAMBÉ glazes.\r\n\r\nThe colour of the first is given by the red sub-oxide of copper, chiefly\r\nsuspended in the glaze. In the case of the _flambé_ or ‘transmutation’\r\nglazes, the strange caprices of colour have their origin, in part at\r\nleast, in the contrast of the red sub-oxide and the green silicate of\r\ncopper. In the case of both these glazes everything depends on the\r\nregulation of the draught of the furnace in which they are fired. The\r\nFrench have lately been at great pains to master the difficulties\r\nattendant upon the development of the effects sought after, and some\r\nsuccess has been attained not only on a porcelain ground as at Sèvres,\r\nbut these glazes have also been applied to fayence at the Golfe St. Juan\r\nand elsewhere. It has been proved by some experiments made at Sèvres,\r\nthat in the firing, the critical period, during which so much depends\r\nupon the regulation of the draught, is _just before_ the melting of the\r\nglaze. Once melted the glaze not only forms an impervious cover which\r\nprevents the smoky flame from discolouring the paste below, but the\r\nglaze itself is no longer sensitive to the action of the gases which\r\nsurround it. It is therefore only during a short period preceding the\r\nmoment when the glaze begins to melt, that it is necessary to promote a\r\nsmoky and reducing flame. This is a point of considerable practical\r\nimportance.[20]\r\n\r\nThe application of the DECORATION UNDER THE GLAZE is essentially a\r\nChinese method. To it we owe the important family of ‘blue and white’\r\nware. The superiority of the Chinese in the management of the blue\r\ncolour has been attributed to various causes. The result is no doubt\r\ninfluenced not only by the constitution of both paste and glaze, but\r\nalso by the fact that the colour is painted upon the _raw_ paste.\r\n\r\nAn important factor also is the care exercised by the Chinese in the\r\nselection and preparation of the blue pigment, by which not only the\r\ndesired intensity but the richness of hue is secured. The quality of the\r\nblue depends in great measure upon the presence of a small quantity of\r\nmanganese in the cobalt ore employed.\r\n\r\nThe only other colour that the Chinese have succeeded in using under the\r\nglaze is the red derived from the sub-oxide of copper. The full\r\ndevelopment of this colour has for long been a lost art, but a less\r\nbrilliant red from this source, often little better than a buff colour,\r\nis sometimes found in later examples combined with the blue.\r\n\r\nIn the application of colours under the glaze there is one difficulty\r\nthat the Chinese have surmounted even in their commonest ware, and this\r\nis the tendency of the cobalt blue to dissolve and ‘run’ in the glaze,\r\ngiving to the design a blurred and indistinct appearance. It would seem\r\nthat the sharpness of outline depends upon the consistency of the glaze\r\nat the moment when it first melts. At that point the glaze should be\r\nviscous and not inclined to flow, and this is what occurs in the case\r\nof the highly calcareous glazes of the Chinese.\r\n\r\nBefore passing to the enamel colours, we must say something of a class\r\nof glazes which may be looked upon as to some extent of an intermediate\r\ncharacter. These are the glazes associated with the ‘San tsai,’ the\r\n‘three colours’ first used in combination by the Chinese.\r\n\r\nThese coloured glazes were applied, not, as is usually the case in\r\nChina, to the raw paste, but they were, it would seem, painted on the\r\nsurface after a preliminary firing. Being applied with a brush, the\r\nwhole surface of the biscuit was not necessarily covered, and glazes of\r\nall these colours could be used upon the same piece of porcelain. Glazes\r\nof this class were rendered more fusible by the addition of a certain\r\nquantity of lead, and on this ground, and still more in their historical\r\nrelation, as we shall see later on, these ‘painted glazes’ may be\r\nconsidered as a link connecting the old refractory glazes of the\r\nmonochrome and ‘blue and white’ wares on the one hand, with the fusible\r\nenamels which were at a later time _superimposed_ upon the glaze on the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nThe three colours which are applied in this way by the Chinese are: (1)\r\nA turquoise blue derived from copper with the addition of some soda or\r\npotash. (2) The manganese purple, often described as aubergine. (3) A\r\nyellow prepared from an iron ore containing some amount of antimony.\r\nNone of these colours would stand the full heat of the furnace, and for\r\na reason which will be explained further on, they are known as the\r\ncolours of the _demi grand feu_.[21]\r\n\r\nCOLOURED ENAMELS. We have now to describe\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PLATE II._ CHINESE MING PORCELAIN, BLACK GROUND]\r\n\r\nthe decoration that is applied to the surface of the glaze. In these\r\ncoloured enamels the colouring matter is dissolved in a flux which\r\ncontains a large quantity of lead. The comparatively gentle heat at\r\nwhich such enamels fuse allows of the use of a much larger palette than\r\nis available for the decoration under the glaze.\r\n\r\nIt is well to point out at the outset the marked distinction in\r\ncomposition and in appearance between the brilliant enamels of the\r\nChinese and the dull tints of the ‘porcelain colours’ found in the hard\r\npastes of Meissen and Sèvres. To make clear the cause of this difference\r\nit will be necessary to enter into some little detail.\r\n\r\nThe colouring matter in the European enamels may amount to as much as a\r\nthird part of the total amount of the flux with which they are\r\nincorporated. As there is not enough of this flux to dissolve the whole\r\nof the oxides, the enamel remains dull and opaque after firing. The\r\nflux, in fact, is only used as a vehicle to attach the colour to the\r\nsurface of the porcelain. The effect in consequence is inferior in\r\nbrilliancy to that obtained by the Chinese with their transparent\r\nenamels in which the metallic oxides, present in much smaller quantity,\r\nare thoroughly dissolved to form a glass. There is, unfortunately, a\r\npractical obstacle to the application of these glassy enamels to the\r\nhard pastes and glazes of Europe. It is impossible to ensure their firm\r\nadhesion to the subjacent glaze. The Chinese, however, do not appear to\r\nfind any difficulty in effecting this. The following explanation has\r\nbeen given to account for the difference of behaviour:--the tendency of\r\nthe enamel to split off in cooling, as has been proved by experiment,\r\narises from the small amount of contraction at that time of the highly\r\nkaolinic paste, compared with that of the superimposed glassy enamel.\r\nThe more silicious paste used by the Chinese contracts, on the contrary,\r\nat the same rate approximately as the enamels that it carries, and\r\nthese enamels may therefore be laid on in sufficient thickness without\r\nany risk of their subsequently splitting off.[22] To appreciate the\r\ndifference in the decorative value of these two classes of enamels it is\r\nonly necessary to compare the brilliant effect, say, of a piece of\r\nChinese egg-shell of the time of Kien-lung with the tame surface of a\r\ncontemporary Meissen plate, elaborately painted with landscapes or\r\nflowers.\r\n\r\nThe glassy enamels used by the Chinese resemble the pastes used for\r\nartificial jewellery. They are essentially silicates of lead and an\r\nalkali. The composition of the flux has to be modified to ensure the\r\nfull development of the colour of the different metallic oxides which\r\nare either made up with it or added subsequently. But in a general way\r\nwe may say that the colourless fluxes which form the basis of the\r\ncoloured enamels are prepared by melting in a crucible a mixture of pure\r\nquartz sand and red lead, and adding more or less alkali. In certain\r\ncases the lead predominates, as when it is proposed to make an emerald\r\ngreen enamel by means of copper, or when the flux is to serve as a basis\r\nfor the ruby colour given by a minute quantity of gold. On the other\r\nhand, if copper be added to a flux containing an excess of either soda\r\nor potash, we obtain a turquoise blue. A fine purple, again, can only be\r\nobtained from manganese with an alkaline flux; if too much lead is\r\npresent only a brown tint is obtainable.\r\n\r\nTo melt these enamels and to ensure their adherence to the subjacent\r\nglaze another firing at a gentler temperature is necessary; indeed in\r\nmany cases more than one such firing has to be resorted to. The\r\ncomparatively high temperature required to develop the colour of one\r\nenamel may be sufficient to decompose or otherwise damage another part\r\nof the decoration. The lowest temperature of all is that of the\r\nmuffle-fire in which the gilding is fixed. This is therefore the last\r\ndecoration to be added.\r\n\r\nThe oven in which these enamels are melted on to the surface of the\r\nalready glazed porcelain is called a muffle. The ware in this case is\r\nprotected from the direct action of the flame by the closed rectangular\r\nbox of fireclay in which it is placed, like bread in a baker’s oven. The\r\nmuffle is placed over the fireplace of a rectangular furnace, and the\r\nflame plays round the sides in such a way as to ensure the uniform\r\ndistribution of the heat. For the sake of greater cleanliness and the\r\navoidance of dust, the pieces to be fired are placed upon tiles of\r\nporcelain rather than upon biscuit or fireclay supports. The temperature\r\nmay vary from a dull to a full red heat (600° to 1000°C.), and the\r\nfiring lasts from four to twelve hours.\r\n\r\nWe have already mentioned incidentally many of the so-called\r\n‘muffle-colours’ or enamels. Those used in China were carefully studied\r\nsome years ago by Ebelmen and Salvétat at Sèvres. It would appear that\r\nthe opaque white of the Chinese is obtained from arsenic--the merits of\r\nthe use of tin for this purpose appear to be unknown to them. The blacks\r\nare made from the already mentioned cobalt-manganese ore (wad), mixed\r\nwith white lead--when oxide of copper is added a more lustrous black is\r\nobtained.[23] For the blue enamel, a very small quantity of cobalt\r\nsuffices to give a brilliant colour. The various tints of the greens and\r\nblues derived from copper depend on the nature of the flux; of this we\r\nhave already given an instance. Antimony in combination with lead gives\r\na bright yellow, which tends to orange when a little iron is present; by\r\nthe addition of more iron the colour of old bronze is imitated. Iron in\r\nthe state of the sesqui-oxide is the source of many shades of red, but\r\nas this iron oxide will not readily combine with silica to form a\r\ntransparent glass, it has to be applied as a more or less opaque paint,\r\nand thus differs from the other colours in being in perceptible relief.\r\nHence the importance of the ruby red derived from gold, which was first\r\nintroduced into China in the early part of the eighteenth century, and\r\nsoon became the predominating colour in the decoration of the time (the\r\n_famille rose_).\r\n\r\nThe palette of the European enameller is a more extensive one, and each\r\nlarge porcelain manufactory has its book of recipes. The composition of\r\nthe enamels and the relation of the metallic oxides to the fluxes\r\nemployed have been systematically studied in more than one laboratory.\r\nIt is only at Sèvres, however, that the results obtained have been made\r\npublic. It has been the pride of successive generations of chemists--of\r\nBrongniart, of Salvétat, of Ebelmen, not to mention living men--to\r\ndevise fresh sources of colour for the decoration of porcelain. First\r\nchromium, then nickel, cadmium, uranium, iridium, and platinum have been\r\nadded to the list of metals from which enamel pigments have been\r\nderived. Among the colours of the muffle-stove the chief gain has\r\nperhaps been the discovery of the quality possessed by the oxide of zinc\r\nof altering the tints of other metallic oxides with which it is mixed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE PORCELAIN OF CHINA\r\n\r\nIntroductory--Classification--The Sung Dynasty (960-1279)--The Mongol or\r\nYuan Dynasty (1280-1368).\r\n\r\n_‘La porcelaine de la Chine! Cette porcelaine supérieure à toutes les\r\nporcelaines de la terre! Cette porcelaine qui a fait depuis des siècles,\r\net sur tout le globe, des passionnés plus fous que dans toutes les\r\nautres branches de la curiosité.... Enfin cette matière terreuse\r\nfaçonnée dans les mains d’hommes en un objet de lumière, de doux coloris\r\ndans un luisant de pierre précieuse.’_--EDMOND DE GONCOURT, ‘La Maison\r\nd’un artiste.’\r\n\r\n\r\nIn any work on porcelain it is something more than the premier place\r\nthat must be given to the ware of China. We are dealing with an art\r\nChinese in origin, and during a succession of many centuries Chinese in\r\nits development. It was only at a comparatively late time that the\r\nknowledge of this art spread over the whole civilised world. We in\r\nEngland have, as it were, acknowledged the pre-eminence of that country\r\nby adopting the word ‘china’ as an equivalent, more or less, to\r\nporcelain.[24]\r\n\r\nIt was under Imperial patronage that the art was developed in China, and\r\nthe excellence of the porcelain of that country has in a measure varied\r\nwith the taste and intelligence with which that patronage was exercised\r\nin different reigns. The native scholar and connoisseur has for ages\r\nbeen a collector of choice pieces, and his influence has always been\r\nexercised in a conservative direction. There is, indeed, in the whole\r\nworld no such consistent _laudator temporis acti_, and it is this\r\nconservative spirit, resulting in a constant ‘returning upon oneself,’\r\nthat it is essential to bear in mind if we are to understand the\r\ninvolved relation of the old and the new in the history of the arts of\r\nChina.\r\n\r\nBut the Chinese potter was not working only for the court or for the\r\nlearned connoisseur, or again for the supply of the towns and villages.\r\nFrom the earliest times, or at least for the last thousand years, there\r\nhas been a demand for his ware, small at first but slowly spreading,\r\nfrom the outer barbarian. Porcelain, or something akin to it, has been\r\nexported from China, by one path or another, from the time of the first\r\nArab settlements at Canton and Kinsay in the eighth or ninth century;\r\nand thus a countervailing influence, acting in the direction of variety\r\nand change, at least as far as the decoration of the ware is concerned,\r\nhas always been present. To give but two instances of this influence--we\r\nshall return to the subject later on: in the intimate connection of the\r\nChinese court with Western Asia, and especially with Persia, in the\r\nthirteenth century, we may probably find the occasion of the first\r\nintroduction into China of the blue decoration under the glaze; and with\r\nmore certainty--the fact is indeed acknowledged by the Chinese--we may\r\nattribute the second great revolution in the decoration of porcelain,\r\nthe use of enamel colours over the glaze, to European or Arab influence.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the decline that set in at the end of the eighteenth\r\ncentury was not a little hastened by the increased demand for ware\r\ndecorated to suit the depraved taste of the ‘Western barbarian.’\r\n\r\nFor in spite of his rigidity and his conservative spirit, the Chinese\r\npotter has always understood how to adapt his wares to the changing\r\ntaste of his customers. Indeed the variation in the decoration, the\r\nsubtle _nuances_ in colour and design, that enable us to distinguish\r\nbetween the Chinese porcelain exported to India, to Persia, and to the\r\nnations of the Christian west, might be made the basis of a most\r\ninteresting study.\r\n\r\nWhen we come to consider the various factories of porcelain that sprang\r\nup in Europe in the course of the eighteenth century, we shall find that\r\nwhat strikes the inquirer above all (in comparison with the kindred arts\r\nof the time) is the little we can observe in the way of development\r\neither in the technique or decoration of the wares. The art springs up\r\nfull-blown; what history there is is concerned rather with an artistic\r\ndecline. It is only in China that we can hope to trace the steps by\r\nwhich this special branch of the potter’s art attained to the perfection\r\nthat we find in the products of the eighteenth century, and this alone\r\nis a reason for dwelling, even in a treatment of the subject so general\r\nand brief as this must needs be, on what may seem to some mere\r\nantiquarian detail.\r\n\r\nBut there is another and perhaps even a more important reason for our\r\ntrying to form some idea of what the earliest wares of the Chinese were\r\nlike: unless we make some such endeavour we shall find it impossible to\r\nunderstand the later history of porcelain in that country. One point\r\nmust be specially borne in mind when we are attempting to follow the\r\norder in which fresh styles and designs were introduced in China. When a\r\nnew method of decoration had been adopted and had come into general\r\nuse--the introduction of underglaze blue in early Ming times, and that\r\nof coloured enamels at a later period, are cases in point--this did not\r\ninvolve the abandonment of the older styles. There was a constant effort\r\nto maintain the old methods, and in the most flourishing times of the\r\nemperors Kang-he and Kien-lung, the series of great men who had charge\r\nof the imperial works at King-te-chen, some of them practical potters\r\nthemselves, were constantly occupied with the problems of reproducing\r\nthe glazes, if not the pastes, of the earliest wares. During the reign\r\nof Yung-chêng (1723-1735), perhaps the culminating period in the history\r\nof Chinese porcelain, when Nien Hsi-yao was superintendent, a list was\r\ndrawn up of fifty-seven varieties of porcelain made at King-te-chen. In\r\nthis list the titles of all the old wares of the Sung dynasty are to be\r\nfound, and to them the place of honour is evidently awarded (Bushell,\r\nchap. xii.). The names of some of these old wares, the Ko yao and the\r\nKuan yao, for instance, are applied to porcelain in common use at the\r\npresent day, an attribution based on the greater or less resemblance of\r\nthis modern ware to the Sung porcelain, at least in the matter of the\r\nglazes.\r\n\r\nIt is only quite of late years that we in Europe have been able to make\r\nany clear distinction, not only between the different classes of Chinese\r\nporcelain, but between what is Chinese and what is not. A few years ago\r\nthe most characteristic porcelain of Japan was classed as Chinese, while\r\non the other hand Corea and even local English factories were credited\r\nwith porcelain made and decorated in one or other of the former\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nIt is nearly two hundred years since the famous letters of the Jesuit\r\nmissionary, the Père D’Entrecolles, were written, and these letters\r\nstill remain our best source of information for the processes of\r\nmanufacture at King-te-chen. There was little further information on the\r\nsubject from the Chinese side[25] until, in 1856, Stanislas Julien\r\ntranslated part of a Chinese work treating chiefly of the same porcelain\r\nfactory--this is the _King-te-chen Tao Lu_, a book which contains in\r\naddition some information about the history of the different wares. This\r\ntranslation was for many years the only native source of information\r\navailable to students of Chinese porcelain, and many were the\r\nmisconceptions and blunders in which these students were landed. The\r\nbook was indeed accompanied by a preface and valuable notes by M.\r\nSalvétat, the porcelain expert of Sèvres, but Julien himself, though an\r\neminent Chinese scholar, had no practical acquaintance either with the\r\nmatter in hand or indeed with the country generally.\r\n\r\nThe beginning of a sounder knowledge of the subject was made when that\r\ncollector of genius, the late Sir A. Wollaston Franks, published a\r\ncatalogue of the private collection of Japanese and Chinese porcelain\r\nwhich he afterwards presented to the nation. His marvellous intuition\r\nand his vast experience enabled him to seize upon points of resemblance\r\nand difference which threw light upon the origin of the various wares,\r\nand to expose at the same time the inconsistencies of the arrangements\r\nthen in vogue. He it was who first pointed out the general\r\nworthlessness, as a guide to the date or even the country of any piece\r\nof porcelain, of the name of dynasty and emperor which it might bear.\r\nHis successor, Mr. C. H. Read, has well carried on the tradition. At the\r\npresent moment the British Museum is one of the few places where an\r\nattempt has been made at a systematic arrangement of a representative\r\ncollection of Chinese and Japanese porcelain.[26]\r\n\r\nIn the meantime in China itself, both in connection with the embassies\r\nat Pekin and among some of the merchants at Shanghai and other treaty\r\nports, much information was being collected, and it was above all the\r\nmerit of Franks to keep himself in communication with and to encourage\r\nall such research. Dr. Hirth, long in the service of the Chinese at\r\nShanghai and elsewhere, has published a series of learned studies\r\ntreating of the relation of the Chinese to the Roman empire, of the Arab\r\ntraders during the Middle Ages, and of the early history of Chinese\r\nporcelain generally. But it is to a former member of our embassy at\r\nPekin, to Dr. Bushell, that we are above all indebted for the throwing\r\nopen of Chinese sources of information upon the history of porcelain. A\r\nworthy successor of the Père D’Entrecolles in his intimate acquaintance\r\nwith the country and its language, Dr. Bushell is well abreast of the\r\nchemical and technical knowledge of the day, and his position as\r\nphysician to our embassy at Pekin has given him access to information\r\nfrom the best Chinese sources, as well as to the treasures of many of\r\nthe native collections of the capital.\r\n\r\nDr. Bushell has written the text to a sumptuously illustrated work,\r\nnominally a catalogue of the collection of porcelain formed by the late\r\nMr. Walters of Philadelphia, and into this text he has woven all the\r\nvast wealth of material that he had accumulated during many years of\r\nstudy both at Pekin and in Europe. This work has thus superseded all\r\nother sources of information on the history and manufacture of Chinese\r\nporcelain. He has, in fact, ransacked all that has been written in China\r\non these subjects, and his translations have this advantage over the\r\nworks of Julien, that they are made by one who knows thoroughly the\r\nsubject that the Chinese author is dealing with.\r\n\r\nWe must not forget the researches on the chemical and technical side of\r\nthe subject by what we may call the school of Sèvres. To these workers\r\nwe have made frequent reference in previous chapters. It is to the\r\nexperiments and analyses of men such as Brongniart, Salvétat, Ebelmen,\r\nand Vogt, that we are indebted for our knowledge of the chemical\r\nconstitution of the paste, the glaze, and the enamels of Chinese\r\nporcelain, as well as for a rational exposition of the methods of its\r\nmanufacture. To sum up, our sources of information of late years are, in\r\nthe main, English, as far as the history and what I may call the\r\nsinology of our subject are concerned; but for the chemistry and\r\ntechnology we must turn to French works. As far as I know, little of\r\nvalue has been published in Germany on the subject of Oriental\r\nporcelain. The discussion between Karabacek, Meyer, and Hirth (whose\r\nlater papers have been published in German) on the early history of\r\nceladon and on the Arab traders of the Middle Ages, is perhaps the most\r\nnotable exception.\r\n\r\nWe are in the dark even now as to the date and place of origin of more\r\nthan one class of Oriental porcelain. On the question of the relation of\r\nthe ceramic wares of China to the contemporary sister arts, there are\r\nmany points to be cleared up,--I mean especially the question how far\r\nthe early wares were influenced by the art of the bronze-caster and the\r\ncarver of jade, and again to what extent the decoration of porcelain in\r\nlater times was dependent upon the example of the contemporary schools\r\nof painting. When we know about the pictorial art of the Chinese even\r\nthe little that we do already of that of their Japanese neighbours, we\r\nshall, to give but one instance, be able to trace the source of the\r\nbeautiful landscapes and flower designs that we find on the vases and\r\nplates of the _famille verte_ and _famille rose_.\r\n\r\nThere is one source of information which remains as yet almost\r\ncompletely untapped. The Japanese have been for many centuries keen\r\ncollectors of Chinese porcelain, as of other Chinese objects of art.\r\nThey have their own views on its history, and some of the finest\r\nspecimens of the older wares remain still in Japan, in spite of the many\r\npieces that have of late years been carried away to Europe and America.\r\nAs we shall see, they have in their own pottery and porcelain handed on\r\nto quite recent days many traditions of Ming and earlier times that have\r\nbeen lost in China. If some Japanese connoisseur or antiquary, strong in\r\nChinese lore, could give us a history of porcelain from his own point of\r\nview, I think that European investigators would have cause to be\r\ngrateful.\r\n\r\nMuch could be gleaned, as I have already said, by studying the relation\r\nof the potters art to that of the jade-carver and the caster of bronze,\r\nand this brings us to an important point that perhaps has not been fully\r\nappreciated by us in the West. I refer to the comparatively late date of\r\nthe beginning of porcelain in China compared, for example, to the arts\r\njust mentioned. We can hardly carry back the history of true porcelain\r\nbeyond the great Tang dynasty (618-907 A.D.), and even in China there is\r\nno existing specimen that can safely be attributed to so early a date.\r\nBut this same Tang dynasty was the very heyday in that country, not only\r\nof military power but also of artistic culture. It would be impossible\r\nto enter into this important subject here; it is one that has been\r\nstrangely ignored by us in Europe. Suffice to say that the great\r\nfigure-painters of this period were looked back to with veneration in\r\nlater times, both in China and in Japan, and that the two schools of\r\nlandscape, the colour school of the North and the black and white\r\n‘literary’ school of the South--schools whose traditions have survived\r\nto the present day--were both founded by Tang artists. At that time art\r\ncritics were known (and even honoured); they already wrote books on the\r\nearly history of painting, and they have left us descriptions of famous\r\ncollections.\r\n\r\nWe may expect, then, to find the influence of these more precocious arts\r\non the early fictile ware of China, and indeed we see the quaint\r\ndecoration and the not too beautiful outlines of the early hieratic\r\nbronzes repeated on the rare specimens that survive from the dynasty\r\nthat after a period of unrest followed that of Tang. This was the Sung\r\ndynasty, which lasted till the time of the Mongol invasion in the\r\nthirteenth century.[27]\r\n\r\nIt is difficult for a European to appreciate the charm, or rather\r\nsuperlative excellence, that is found by a Chinaman in a fine specimen\r\nof jade. It is, however, a substance that is closely linked with his\r\nphilosophy, his religion, and above all with his all-important\r\nceremonial. No wonder, then, if from an early time he strove, with the\r\npastes and glazes at his command, to imitate such a material. And\r\nnumberless references in contemporary writers, as well as the evidence\r\nof many of the oldest pieces of porcelain surviving, show that this was\r\nthe case. We may safely say that in these early specimens the thick\r\nglaze, of tints varying from a true celadon to a more pronounced blue or\r\ngreen, was admired in proportion to its resemblance to jade. As for the\r\nporcelain itself, all that was looked for in the paste was that it\r\nshould be hard, and that the vessel when struck should give out a\r\nbell-like sound--‘a plaintive note like a cup of jade,’ as one early\r\nChinese writer says of a porcelain cup in his collection.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese in these times possessed also elaborately carved vessels of\r\nrock crystal and of various kinds of chalcedony, and these also it was\r\nattempted to imitate with the early glazes. Glass, too, as a material\r\nfor small objects, was probably known; it seems, however, to have been\r\nsomewhat of a rarity. It is mentioned by writers of the Tang period in\r\nconnection with these early wares, and indeed it is possible that there\r\nmay be some confusion in the literature of the time (or rather perhaps\r\nin our interpretation of the language used) between the two\r\nmaterials--the thickly glazed porcelain and the more or less opaque\r\nglass.\r\n\r\nAfter these preliminary remarks we shall be in a better position to\r\ninterpret the somewhat involved and contradictory allusions to our\r\nsubject found in Chinese books.\r\n\r\nWe now come to the important question of the classification of Chinese\r\nporcelain. A difficulty here arises from the rival claims of two\r\nsystems. The older and perhaps safer division depends solely on the\r\nnature of the ware, its colour, decoration, etc.; but in opposition to\r\nthis the claim of the more logical, historical classification has, with\r\nour increasing knowledge, become of late years more pressing. The result\r\nhas been an attempt to combine the two systems. Such an attempt must\r\nnecessarily lead to many compromises, and yet something of the sort is\r\nperhaps the only available plan. We may compare the development of the\r\nceramic art in China to what has taken place in the evolution of the\r\nanimal kingdom: while new and more elaborated forms are evolved, the\r\nolder ones, or many of them, survive in but slightly modified forms. If\r\nthis tendency be borne well in mind there will be less danger of\r\nconfusion between the really old types and the modern representations or\r\neven copies which are called, in China, by the same names.\r\n\r\nThe three classes into which Chinese porcelain is divided--and there is\r\na general agreement among collectors on this head--rest on such an\r\nattempt to combine a historical with a technical classification:--\r\n\r\n1. Porcelain with single-coloured glazes, including plain white ware.\r\nThe colour of the glaze is derived from two metals only, iron and\r\ncopper. Any further decoration depends upon the moulding of the surface\r\nor upon patterns incised in the paste. All the wares made up to the end\r\nof the Sung period (1279 A.D.) may probably be included in this class.\r\n\r\n2. Porcelain decorated with colour under the glaze. This division is\r\nnearly equivalent to our ‘blue and white’ ware, but in addition to\r\ncobalt, copper is at times introduced to give a red colour. This system\r\nof decoration was probably introduced during the course of the\r\nfourteenth century, and it is associated with the Ming dynasty.\r\n\r\n3. Porcelain decorated with enamels over the glaze, necessitating a\r\nsecond firing in a muffle-stove. The use of these fusible enamel colours\r\ncame in probably during the sixteenth century, but the art was not fully\r\ndeveloped till much later.\r\n\r\nThe glazes of the first and second classes as a rule contained no lead,\r\nand to melt them the full heat of the oven, the _grand feu_, was\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, a class of porcelain which does not fall well into\r\nany of the above divisions, but which is historically of great\r\nimportance. The blue, purple, and yellow glazes of this ware were\r\n_painted_ on the biscuit after a preliminary baking of the paste, and\r\nthen fired, not in the hottest part of the furnace, but in what we may\r\ncall the _demi grand feu_. The glaze of this ware contains lead, and\r\nthis fact and the method of the decoration may be held to give it a\r\nposition bridging over the interval between our first two classes and\r\nthe third--that of enamelled porcelain. This ware, _painted on the\r\nbiscuit_, dates, however, from an earlier time than the latter class,\r\nand must not be confused with it.\r\n\r\nAs I have pointed out, these types did not entirely replace one another,\r\nfor the earlier forms continued to be made by the side of the later.\r\n\r\nOne of our principal difficulties in discussing the early wares of China\r\nis to reconcile and co-ordinate the various types described in old\r\nChinese books with the few specimens surviving at the present day. Of\r\nthese scanty examples we can point to scarcely any in public\r\ncollections; the rare pieces that have been brought from China are in\r\nthe hands of private collectors in England, France, and America. In the\r\nChinese authorities we find as early as the tenth century references to\r\nporcelain which was ‘blue as the sky, brilliant as a mirror, thin as\r\npaper, and as sonorous as a piece of jade’; an emperor who reigned just\r\nbefore the accession of the Sung dynasty (960 A.D.) demanded that the\r\nporcelain made for him should be ‘of the azure tint of the sky after\r\nrain, as it appears in the interval between the clouds.’ Compare with\r\nthese descriptions the thick paste, barely translucent, the heavy\r\nirregular glaze, greyish white to celadon or pale blue, of the few\r\nspecimens of undoubted antiquity that have survived to our day. How can\r\nwe reconcile the tradition with the material evidence? Two explanations\r\nhave been given of the discrepancy. According to one theory, all the\r\nmore delicate and fragile pieces have disappeared ‘under the hands of\r\ntime’ (or shall we say more definitely under those of endless\r\ngenerations of housemaids?), only the heavy, solid specimens surviving.\r\nThe other theory is simpler: it is that the writers of the books are apt\r\nto fall into exaggeration when speaking of any matter that has the\r\nsanction of age--that, not to mince matters, they are as a class great\r\nliars; and this is a point of view that commends itself to those who\r\nhave any acquaintance with Chinese literature.[28]\r\n\r\nWe have now, however, one source of information for these early wares\r\nupon which, although it is in a measure a literary source, we can place\r\ngreater reliance. This is nothing less than an illustrated list, a\r\n_catalogue raisonné_, of famous specimens of porcelain, drawn up by a\r\ndistinguished Chinese art connoisseur and collector as long ago as the\r\nend of the sixteenth century. In this manuscript there were more than\r\neighty coloured reproductions of pieces, both from the author’s own\r\ncollection and from those of his friends. The work came from the library\r\nof a Chinese prince of high rank, and it was purchased in Pekin by Dr.\r\nBushell some twenty years ago. Since then this valuable document has\r\nperished in a fire at a London warehouse, where it had been deposited,\r\nbut not before the illustrations had been copied by a Chinese artist and\r\nits owner had made a careful translation and analysis of its\r\ncontents.[29] The writer, Hsiang-yuan-pien, better known as Tzu-ching,\r\nafter giving a brief sketch of the early history of ceramics in his\r\ncountry, exclaims apologetically: ‘I have acquired a morbid taste for\r\npot-sherds. I delight in buying choice specimens of Sung, Yuan, and Ming\r\nware, and exhibiting them in equal rank with the bells, urns, and\r\nsacrificial wine-vessels of bronze dating from the three ancient\r\ndynasties, from the Chin and the Han’ (2250 B.C. to 220 A.D.)--that is\r\nto say, in placing them in the same rank as antiquities that are\r\nacknowledged to be worthy of the attention of the scholar. Porcelain at\r\nthat time, we see, had hardly established its claim to so dignified a\r\nposition; hence the apologetic tone. After telling us how with the\r\nadvice of a few intimate friends he had selected choice specimens, which\r\nhe then copied in colour and carefully described, Tzu-ching concludes\r\nwith these words: ‘Say not that my hair is scant and sparse, and yet I\r\nmake what is only fit for a child’s toy.’ This appeal is evidently\r\naddressed to the Lord Macaulays of his day.[30]\r\n\r\nThe first point to notice in this catalogue is that more than half of\r\nthe objects described are attributed to the Sung period (960-1279 A.D.),\r\nthat is to say, they were at least three hundred years old at the time\r\nwhen Tzu-ching wrote. The Sung dynasty, we must bear in mind, was above\r\nall remembered as a period of great wealth and material prosperity. Less\r\nwarlike than the Tang which preceded it, the arts were cultivated at the\r\ncourt of the pleasure-loving emperors who had their capital during the\r\nearlier time at Kai-feng Fu (in the north of Honan, near to the great\r\nbend of the Hoang-ho). When driven south by the advance of the more\r\nwarlike Mongols they retired to Hangchow, the Kinsay of which Marco Polo\r\nhas such wonderful tales to relate. In these early days there was no\r\ngreat centre for the manufacture of porcelain; it was made in many\r\nwidely separated districts, so that the classification of these early\r\nwares is, in a measure, a geographical one. At King-te-chen, at least in\r\nthe later Sung period, they were already making porcelain, but for court\r\nuse only, it would appear, for at that time the factory was a strict\r\nimperial preserve, and its wares did not come into the market.\r\n\r\nAs to the still older wares, those of Ch’ai and of Ju, which generally\r\nhold the place of honour in Chinese lists, it was of the first that the\r\nemperor spoke when he commanded that pieces intended for his own use\r\nshould be clear as the sky after rain; but no specimen of this porcelain\r\nwas extant even in Ming times. Its place, it would seem, was taken by\r\nthe JU YAO (the word _yao_ is about equivalent to our term ‘ware’),\r\nwhich, like the Ch’ai, came from the province of Honan. This ware also\r\nis now practically extinct; Tzu-ching, however, claims to have possessed\r\nsome specimens, and of these he gives more than one illustration. The\r\nglaze was thick and like melted lard (a comparison often made by the\r\nChinese), and varied in colour from a _clair-de-lune_ to a brighter\r\ntint of blue. The name Ju, we may add, is often applied to more modern\r\nglazes which resemble the old ones in colour and thickness.\r\n\r\nThe name KUAN YAO, which means ‘official’ or ‘imperial’ porcelain, has\r\nbeen the cause of much confusion; the term has been applied to any ware\r\nmade for imperial use. That of the Sung dynasty was made in the\r\nimmediate neighbourhood of the imperial court, first at Kai-feng Fu and\r\nlater at Hangchow. In its more strict use the term Kuan yao is applied\r\nto pieces generally of archaic form, to censers ornamented with\r\ngrotesque heads of monstrous animals, and to wares of other shapes\r\ncopied from old ritual bronzes. The glaze varies in colour from emerald\r\ngreen to greyish green and _clair-de-lune_, it is generally crackled,\r\nthe cracks forming large ‘crab-claw’ divisions. Other kinds are\r\ndescribed as white and very thin, but of these, perhaps for one of the\r\nreasons given above, no examples have survived to our day.\r\n\r\nLUNG-CHUAN YAO and KO YAO. It will be convenient to class together these\r\ntwo most important types of Chinese porcelain. At the present day these\r\nnames are applied in China to some comparatively common varieties of\r\nporcelain, not necessarily of any great age. But more strictly\r\nLung-chuan yao is the term used by the Chinese for the heavy celadon\r\npieces, whether dating from Sung or from Ming times, which were the\r\nfirst kinds of porcelain to become a regular article of export; while\r\nthe word Ko yao is used as a general name for many kinds of crackle\r\nware, which may vary in colour from white to a full celadon. In a more\r\nrestricted sense it includes only the early pieces with a greyish white\r\nglaze and well-marked crackles.\r\n\r\nLUNG-CHUAN WARE was made during Sung times at a town of that name in the\r\nprovince of Chekiang, situated about halfway between the Poyang lake\r\nand the coast. In Ming times the kilns were removed to the adjacent\r\nprovincial capital, Chu-chou Fu, nearer to the coast. This was probably\r\nthe ware that Marco Polo saw when passing through the town of Tingui. It\r\nwas largely exported from the ports of Zaitun and Kinsay. It will,\r\nhowever, be better to defer the discussion of this thorny question to a\r\nlater chapter, when we shall have something to say about the way in\r\nwhich the knowledge of Chinese porcelain was spread through the\r\nMohammedan and Christian west. It will be enough for the present to\r\nmention that the Lung-chuan ware was the original type and always\r\nremained one of the principal sources of the Martabani celadon so prized\r\nin early Saracen times.\r\n\r\nAs this is the first time that we come across celadon ware,[31] we may\r\nmention that we use the term in the older and narrower sense for a\r\ngreyish sea-green colour tending at times to blue. The name is, however,\r\nsometimes made to cover nearly the whole range of monochrome glazes. It\r\nis the _Ching-tsu_[32] of the Chinese and the _Sei-ji_ of the Japanese.\r\n\r\nThe true Lung-chuan celadon of Sung times was, however, of a more\r\npronounced grass-green colour. But we are concerned rather with the\r\nlater celadon made at Chu-chou Fu during the Ming period. For it is to\r\nthis time that we must refer most of the heavy dishes and bowls, often\r\nfluted or moulded in low relief with a floral design of peony or lotus\r\nflowers, or again with plaited patterns surrounding a fish or dragon\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PLATE III._ 1--CHINESE, CELADON WARE\r\n2--CHINESE, CELADON WARE]\r\n\r\nwhich occupies the centre; in other examples the decoration is engraved\r\nin the paste. In either case, whether moulded or engraved, the glaze\r\naccumulating in the hollows helps to accentuate the pattern. The paste\r\nas seen through the glaze where the latter is thin appears white, but\r\nwhere the glaze is absent, as on the foot, or where it is exposed by\r\nbubbles or other irregularities, the ground is seen to be of a peculiar\r\nreddish tint. By this test the Chinese claim to distinguish the older\r\nceladon, the true _martabani_, from the later imitations made at\r\nKing-te-chen. The paste of these later copies is often artificially\r\ncoloured on the exposed surface so that they may resemble the old ware\r\n(Hirth, _Ancient Porcelain_, pp. 21 _seq._).\r\n\r\nAs for the KO YAO, the old ware of Sung times is said to have been first\r\nmade in the twelfth century. The Chinese character with which ‘Ko’ is\r\nwritten means ‘elder brother.’ According to the books there were at this\r\ntime at Lung-chuan two brother potters named Chang. The elder brother\r\nleaving the younger Chang to continue in the old ways, started to make a\r\nnew ware distinguished by the crackle of its glaze. This was originally\r\na thick, heavy ware, with the iron-red foot and white paste already\r\nnoticed, but, as we have said, the name is now used for a large class of\r\ncrackle ware with a glaze of celadon, of greyish white and especially of\r\na yellowish stone colour. This porcelain with grey and yellowish crackle\r\ndoes not seem to have been so largely exported as the uncrackled\r\nceladon; bowls and jars of a similar ware have, however, been found in\r\nBorneo and in the adjacent islands.\r\n\r\nCHÜN YAO.--It is to this ware that we may trace back the now famous\r\nfamily of _flambé_ porcelain. Chün yao was already made in early Sung\r\ntimes, _i.e._ before the Mongol conquests of the twelfth century, in\r\nHonan, not far from the old capital of Kai-feng Fu. A description in a\r\nwork of the seventeenth century leaves no doubt as to its\r\nidentification. ‘As to this Chün yao,’ the writer says, ‘a fine specimen\r\nshould be red as cinnabar, green as onion-leaves or the plumage of the\r\nkingfisher, and purple, brown, and black like the skin of the\r\negg-plant.’ We have here the description of that ‘transmutation’ or\r\n_flambé_ ware of which such magnificent examples were made at\r\nKing-te-chen in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and which has\r\nlately been successfully imitated in France. The play of flashing colour\r\nin the glaze was said to have been originally the result of accident,\r\nbut we must not attach much importance to statements of this kind. In\r\nthe old Sung pieces the clay is less white and fine than in the highly\r\nfinished examples made at King-te-chen during the reigns of Kang-he and\r\nYung-cheng. On the Sung ware we may frequently find a number (from one\r\nto nine) engraved, sometimes more than once, in the paste, and these\r\ncharacters are carefully copied in the later reproductions. We have here\r\nperhaps the earliest instance of the employment of a mark on porcelain.\r\nThe old writers tell us apologetically of the vulgar names given, by way\r\nof joke, it would seem, to these glazes, such as mule’s lungs or pig’s\r\nliver--no inapt comparisons, however, for some of the effects seen in\r\nthese old wares. These varied hues were of course obtained from copper\r\nin the first place, though the presence of iron, in both stages of\r\noxidation, may sometimes add to the variety of the tints.\r\n\r\nKIEN YAO.--This was a dark-coloured ware made at Kien-chou, north-west\r\nof the port of Fuchou. It must not be confused with the well-known\r\ncreamy-white ware of Fukien, exported in later days from the same port.\r\nCertain shallow conical cups of this ware, with a vitreous glaze, almost\r\nblack, but relieved around the margin with small streaks and spots of a\r\nlighter colour, were especially valued from very early times for the\r\npreparation of powdered tea--nowhere more than in Japan, where an\r\nundoubted specimen of this Kien ware is treasured as a priceless\r\nheirloom. There is an excellent specimen in the British Museum: a\r\ncareful examination of this little bowl will give no little aid in\r\nunderstanding what are some of the qualities that are looked for in\r\nChina and Japan in these old glazes. There is a quiet charm in the\r\nglassy surface, and an air as of some quaint natural stone carefully\r\ncarved and polished rather than of a product of the potter’s wheel.\r\n\r\nTING YAO.--In the Ting yao of the Sung dynasty, as in the case of the\r\ncontemporaneous celadon and crackle wares, we have the oldest type of an\r\nimportant class of porcelain. The earlier specimens have served more\r\nthan once as models for famous potters of Ming and later times. It was\r\nprobably at Ting-chou, a town in the province of Chihli, to the\r\nsouth-west of Pekin, that a brilliant white porcelain was first\r\nsuccessfully made by the Chinese, possibly as early as the time of the\r\nTang dynasty; and the name of Ting yao has remained associated with all\r\npure white wares of a certain quality, even though made at other places.\r\nAs in the case of the celadon porcelain, the decoration, if any, was\r\neither in low relief or incised in the paste; but in opposition to many\r\nof the other wares we have mentioned, the Ting porcelain seems from the\r\nfirst to have been made from a paste of great fineness, its translucency\r\nwas at times considerable, and the patterns were engraved or moulded\r\nwith much delicacy. The design when engraved is scarcely visible unless\r\nthe vessel is held up to the light. The specimens of Ting ware that\r\nsurvive date probably from Mongol or from Ming times. The British Museum\r\npossesses a remarkable collection of these Ting bowls and plates. A pair\r\nof very thin pure white shallow bowls are noticeable as having in the\r\ncentre an inscription finely engraved in minute characters under the\r\nglaze. It is the nien-hao or year-mark of the Emperor Yung-lo\r\n(1402-1424), the first great name among the emperors of the Ming\r\ndynasty. This is perhaps the earliest date-mark with any pretentions to\r\ngenuineness that has been found on the Chinese porcelain in our\r\ncollections. The decoration, in this case, is formed by a five-clawed\r\ndragon faintly engraved in the paste. These bowls are specimens of the\r\n_feng_ or ‘flour’ Ting ware (also known as _Pai_ or ‘white’ Ting), but\r\nmost of the Ting plates in the same collection are of quite another kind\r\nof ware, which has a surface like that of a European soft-paste\r\nporcelain--this the Chinese know as the _Tu-Ting_ or earthy Ting. This\r\nlatter ware has in fact a soft lead glaze covering a hard body, and must\r\ntherefore have required two firings, the first to thoroughly bake the\r\npaste, and a second at a lower temperature to melt the glaze on to it.\r\nSome of the specimens of this _Tu-Ting_ in the British Museum are said\r\nto date from Sung times. I do not know what is the authority for the use\r\nof a lead glaze in China at so early a date. Many of these plates have\r\ncertainly a great appearance of age, but this antique look is due in\r\nsome measure to the ‘weathering’ of the soft glazes on the exposed\r\nsurfaces. This weathering has brought into prominence the very graceful\r\ndecoration of lotus-flowers, but the surface is often discoloured by\r\nstains as of some oily matter which has apparently found its way under\r\nthe glaze. The copper bands with which the edges of many of these plates\r\nare bound are mentioned in the old accounts; those in use in the palace,\r\nit is said, were fitted thus with collars to preserve the tender\r\nmaterial.\r\n\r\nWe must postpone the account of the rival white ware, the creamy\r\nporcelain of Fukien, or later Kien yao, as none of it was made as early\r\nas the time of the Sung dynasty. The Kien yao of that time, as we have\r\nseen, was quite another ware.\r\n\r\nWe have now mentioned the most important of the classes of Chinese\r\nporcelain that date from early times. We have confined our brief notice\r\nto the varieties of which specimens have survived, laying special stress\r\nupon those kinds which have, as it were, founded a family, and which we\r\ncan therefore study in specimens from later ages. The names of many\r\nother wares of both the Sung and Tang periods may be found in Chinese\r\nbooks, but of these we do not propose to say a word.\r\n\r\nThe paste of these early wares is rarely of a pure white, and their\r\ntranslucency is generally very slight, but they are not for that reason\r\nto be classed as stonewares. The materials were probably in all cases\r\nderived from granitic rocks, that is to say, from a more or less\r\ndecomposed granite (containing mica and often a certain amount of iron)\r\nmixed with some kind of impure kaolin. Professor Church, in his Cantor\r\nLectures, gives us two analyses of ‘old Chinese ware,’ which confirm\r\nthis view. One specimen, with a white body, was found to contain 75 per\r\ncent. of silica, about 18 per cent. of alumina, and about 5·5 per cent.\r\nof alkalis (chiefly potash). The other, of brownish coloured paste,\r\ncontained a little less silica, but as much as 2·5 per cent. of iron.\r\nFor the roughly prepared material of these old wares we would prefer the\r\nname of proto-porcelain or kaolinic stoneware, so that there may be no\r\nconfusion with the true stoneware of Europe, a quite different\r\nmaterial.[33]\r\n\r\nIn the absence of more ordinary clays in the central and northern parts\r\nof China, some such kaolinic pottery may have been made by the Chinese\r\nfrom very early times. When in Tang or in earlier days it occurred to\r\nthem to attempt to imitate jade or other natural stones, they had the\r\ngood fortune to be already using materials that allowed of these\r\nexperiments being after a time crowned with success. The important point\r\nthat still remains unsettled is at what date they first succeeded in\r\ncovering a ware of this class with a vitreous coating. For the date of\r\nthe first use of glaze in China we can at present only give a very wide\r\nlimit, let us say some time between the first and the fifth century of\r\nour era. Very probably it was their acquaintance with the nature of\r\nglass that put them on the right track. This material, it is said, they\r\nfirst knew of from their intercourse with the later Roman empire. There\r\nis some reason to believe that they acquired at the same time the secret\r\nof its manufacture, though, according to the Chinese, the art was lost\r\nat a later time.[34]\r\n\r\nWe can now form some idea of how far the art of making porcelain had\r\nadvanced at the time when the tide of the Mongol invasion swept over the\r\ncountry. Our knowledge of the wares made at this time must be derived\r\nchiefly from the imitations of the older porcelain made at a later\r\nperiod, but in such a conservative country as China this reservation is\r\nof no great importance. We must remember that in all these wares there\r\nwas no other decoration than that given by the glaze as applied to the\r\nvariously moulded or incised surface of the paste. The nature of the\r\nglaze was therefore of pre-eminent importance. The range of colour,\r\nexcept in the rare _flambé_ vases, was in the main confined to shades of\r\nblue and green, and even of these colours pronounced tints are rare. All\r\nthe colours at the command of the potters of these days were derived\r\nfrom the oxides of iron and copper. And yet with such simple elements,\r\nwhat an infinite variety! It has been truly said by a French writer that\r\nthe beauty of the glaze is the _qualité maîtresse de la céramique_, and\r\nit is partly a recognition of this claim that has led so many French and\r\nAmerican collectors, of late, to follow the example of the Chinese and\r\nJapanese connoisseurs, and to give so marked a preference to monochrome\r\nporcelains, which owe their charm to the\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PLATE IV._ CHINESE]\r\n\r\nmerits of the glaze alone. But the specimens we find in these\r\ncollections are with but few exceptions of much later date. The price\r\nthat a fine piece of Sung ware, above all if it has a good pedigree and\r\ncomes from a known collection, has always commanded in China has\r\nsufficed, at least until quite lately, to keep such specimens in their\r\nnative country.\r\n\r\nAs we have said, there are very few examples in our public collections\r\nthat can with any assurance be attributed to Sung times. In the British\r\nMuseum, in the same case with the Kien yao tea-bowl already mentioned,\r\nis a jar some twelve inches in height, with two small handles on the\r\nshoulder. It is of irregular shape and covered with a thick glaze of a\r\npale turquoise blue, faintly crackled. Close to the mouth is a bright\r\nred mark, like a piece of sealing-wax, due probably to the local partial\r\nreduction of the copper. This beautiful but very archaic-looking jar\r\n(PL. IV.) is attributed to no earlier date than the later or southern\r\nSung dynasty (1127-1279). Among the large number of crackle monochrome\r\npieces in the same collection there are many specimens which a Chinese\r\nconnoisseur would classify as Ko yao, and similarly some of the old\r\n_flambé_ pieces might be termed Chün yao, without definitely assigning\r\nthem to Sung times. The Lung-Chuan celadons are represented by some\r\nearly pieces, more than one distinguished by the red foot. There are\r\nsome fine plates of old heavy celadon at South Kensington, not a few\r\npurchased in Persia. Here may also be found a celadon jar cut down at\r\nthe neck; and the ‘mouth’ thus artificially formed has been carefully\r\nstained of a red colour to imitate the old ware. The French museums are\r\nparticularly rich in specimens of old _martabani_ celadon--I would point\r\nespecially to several large dishes both at Sèvres and in the _Musée\r\nGuimet_. But what is perhaps the finest collection in Europe of celadon\r\nand other old wares is now to be seen in the museum at Gotha. It was\r\nbrought together by the late Duke of Edinburgh, who added to previous\r\nacquisitions the collection formed in China by Dr. Hirth.\r\n\r\n\r\nYUAN DYNASTY (1280-1368).\r\n\r\nProbably at no period during its long history has the Chinese empire\r\nbeen subjected to such a thorough shaking up, to such a complete\r\nupsetting and reversal of its ancient ways, as during the advance of the\r\nMongols from the north to the south during the twelfth and thirteenth\r\ncenturies. When they had at length subdued the whole land, there was a\r\nmoment during the rule of the liberal-minded Kublai Khan when the old\r\nbarriers and prejudices seemed to have been broken down, and when the\r\nMiddle Kingdom appeared to be about to enter the general comity of\r\nnations. This is what gives to Marco Polo’s account of the country,\r\nwhich he visited at the time, so very ‘un-Chinese’ an air. We hear of\r\nItalian friars and French goldsmiths at the court, and of projected\r\nembassies from the Pope. Still closer were the relations with the\r\nMohammedan people of Western Asia, then ruled by members of Kublai’s\r\nfamily. Marco Polo, we know, formed part of the escort of Kublai’s\r\nsister, when she travelled by sea to Persia to become the bride of the\r\nMongol khan of that country; and a predecessor of this latter ruler,\r\nHulugu, as early as the middle of the thirteenth century, brought over,\r\nit is said, as many as a thousand Chinese artificers and settled them in\r\nPersia.\r\n\r\nAnd yet when scarcely two generations later the degenerate descendants\r\nof Kublai were driven from the imperial throne and replaced by a native\r\ndynasty, what slight permanent trace do we see of all these changes\r\nreflected in the arts of the Middle Kingdom! No doubt, on looking\r\nclosely, we should find that a change had taken place during these\r\nyears: new materials had been brought in, new forms and new decorations\r\napplied to the metal ware and the pottery of the Chinese. It is in\r\nconnection with these two arts especially (and we may add to them the\r\ndesigns on textile fabrics) that we find so many points of interest in\r\nthe mutual influence of the civilisations of China and Persia at this\r\ntime. We must remember that in the thirteenth century the craftsman of\r\nPersia, as the inheritor of both Saracenic and older traditions, was in\r\nmany respects ahead of his rival artist in China.\r\n\r\nAs far as the potter’s art was concerned this was the first meeting of\r\ntwo contrasted schools, which between them cover pretty well the whole\r\nfield of ceramics--of that part at least of the field in which the glaze\r\nis the principal element in the decoration.[35]\r\n\r\nThe Persian ware of this time was the culminating example of an art that\r\nhad been handed down from the Egyptians and the Assyrians. As a rule,\r\namong these races, the baser nature of the paste had been concealed by a\r\nmore or less opaque coating either of a fine clay or ‘slip,’ or of a\r\nglaze rendered non-transparent by the addition of tin; it is on this\r\ncoating that the decoration is painted, to be covered subsequently (in\r\nthe first case at least, that of the slip ware) by a coating of glaze.\r\nIt is to this large class, for the most part to the latter or\r\nstanniferous division, that nearly all the famous wares of the European\r\nrenaissance belong, not only the Spanish and Italian majolica but the\r\nenamelled fayence of France and Holland as well. It was with the latter\r\ntwo wares that at a later date the porcelain of China was destined to\r\ncome into competition. Each of these ceramic schools, the Eastern\r\nporcelain and the Western fayence, might in certain points claim\r\nadvantages over the other, advantages both of a practical and of an\r\næsthetic nature. For example, the glory of the Persian fayence of that\r\nday lay in its application to architecture, in the brilliant coating of\r\ntiles that covered the walls and the domes of the mosques and dwellings\r\nboth inside and out. The Chinese have never succeeded in making tiles of\r\nany size with their porcelain. When used for the decoration of buildings\r\nthe porcelain, or rather the earthenware, is always in the form of\r\nsolid, moulded bricks.\r\n\r\nBut there is another matter with which the Chinese who visited Western\r\nAsia at that time cannot fail to have been struck--with the materials, I\r\nmean, at the command of the Persians, for the application of colour both\r\nunder and over the glaze. Of the decorations over the glaze the most\r\nimportant were those given by their famous metallic lustres. This\r\nlustre, we now know, was the result of an ingenious process by which a\r\nfilm of copper, or sometimes of silver, was developed on the surface of\r\nthe glaze.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese have never attempted anything of the kind, in part because\r\nsuch a method of adornment was foreign to their notions of what was\r\nfitting. For we must bear in mind that the influence of the literary\r\ntradition in China has always tended towards simplicity of means in\r\ntheir decorative arts, and has been opposed to anything like an\r\nostentatious display of expensive materials. Any marked infringement of\r\nthis sentiment, even on the part of an emperor, has always called forth\r\na protest from the censors. Another cause which hindered the adoption of\r\nthe lustre decoration by the Chinese may be found, no doubt, in the\r\ndifficulties of its practical application. At that time the processes of\r\nthe muffle-stove for decoration over the glaze were quite unknown to\r\nthem.[36] But the Saracens, in Western Asia, were already in possession\r\nof another means of decorating their ware. This they found in the use of\r\ncobalt, especially as a material for painting a design on the paste\r\nbefore the application of the glaze. We find this colour at times on the\r\ntiles that lined their prayer-niches; these indeed date from a somewhat\r\nlater time. But there is another variety of Saracenic ware of which a\r\nfew specimens have survived. I refer to the vases and bowls covered with\r\na thick alkaline glaze, and decorated, in part at least, _under the\r\nglaze_ with a design of black lines and some rude patches of blue. These\r\nrare vases were formerly classed as Siculo-Moorish, but later research\r\nhas proved most of them to be of Persian or perhaps rather of Syrian or\r\nMesopotamian origin. They appear to be the work of thirteenth century\r\npotters, and some of them may be of even earlier date.[37]\r\n\r\nWhen we consider that there is no evidence of the use of cobalt by the\r\nChinese for the decoration of their porcelain during Sung times, that\r\nindeed the use of colour apart from that of the glaze as a means of\r\ndecoration appears to have been then unknown; but that, on the other\r\nhand, not long after the turmoil of the Mongol invasion and\r\ndomination--a period during which the two countries, China and Persia,\r\nwere so closely connected--we find the use of cobalt as a decoration\r\n_sous couverte_ firmly established, we may, I think, regard it as not\r\nimprobable that it was from the Persians that the Chinese learned the\r\nnew method of decoration.[38]\r\n\r\nThe influence of the Saracenic art of Western Asia is indeed now for the\r\nfirst time to be seen in other directions, and we shall find it cropping\r\nup here and there during the whole of the following Ming period. It was\r\nthe source of many new forms which we see now for the first time in\r\nChina: the graceful water-vessels, for instance, with long necks and\r\ncurved spouts, copied from the Arab _Ibraik_. Again, we find this\r\ninfluence at times in the _motifs_ of the conventional floral patterns\r\nfound on Ming porcelain, though these patterns, indeed, are always mere\r\ncounterchanges, as it were, upon a field of an unmistakable Chinese\r\nstamp (PL. VI.). All these changes were doubtless regarded as anathema\r\nby the Chinese censors, who reminded the rash innovators that the great\r\nmen of old were content with simple materials and forms, and that they\r\nin their wisdom rejected all such meretricious ornament. For it was\r\nseriously maintained that had they thought it desirable, these old sages\r\ncould have commanded all the resources of the later potter, not only the\r\nlarger field he could draw from for his designs and colours, but the\r\nimproved paste of his porcelain as well.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the Chinese influence at this time on Persian art was\r\nsmall. By a careful search we may find at times a dragon or a phœnix\r\namid unmistakable Chinese clouds on the spandrel above the arch of a\r\nPersian prayer-niche of the fourteenth century, or forming the centre of\r\na star-shaped tile. But the great invasion of Chinese wares and Chinese\r\nschemes of decoration belongs, as far as the fictile art of the country\r\nis concerned, to a later period, that of Shah Abbas in the early years\r\nof the seventeenth century.\r\n\r\nIt is not unlikely that in China the Western influence did not make much\r\nway until the time of the early Ming emperors, and that it was due more\r\nimmediately to the growing commercial intercourse with the Persian\r\nGulf, but this intercourse was itself fostered by the events of the\r\nMongol invasion.\r\n\r\nThere is very little to be said of the porcelain made during the time of\r\nthe MONGOL or YUAN dynasty, and we have few specimens that can be\r\ndefinitely assigned to that period. The name is still given in Pekin to\r\na rude, somewhat heavy ware, with a thick glaze of mingled tints, among\r\nwhich a shade of lavender with speckles of red predominates. This is but\r\na modification of the Chün yao of Sung times, and belongs in a general\r\nway to the class of ‘transmutation’ wares--those in which the colours\r\ndepend on the partial reduction of the oxides of iron and copper in the\r\nglaze. Specimens of this ware that claim to be of Chinese origin are\r\noften found in Japan, where they are much in favour for use as flower\r\nvases, but neither in that country nor in China have the pieces we meet\r\nwith much claim to any great antiquity.\r\n\r\nThere is only one specimen in the Bushell manuscript that is attributed\r\nby Tzu-ching to the Yuan period--this is a little vase of white ware\r\ndecorated with dragons faintly engraved in the paste under the glaze.\r\n\r\nThis white ware, generally classed as Ting, is indeed in many of our\r\nbooks on porcelain considered to be especially characteristic of the\r\nMongol dynasty, but I cannot find any definite confirmation of this. The\r\nfiner pieces of plain white seem to be generally attributed by the\r\nChinese rather to the beginning of the next dynasty. The little white\r\nplate in the Dresden Museum, said to have been ‘brought back from the\r\nEast by a crusader,’ has no claim to such an early date.[39]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE PORCELAIN OF CHINA--(_continued_).\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MING DYNASTY (1368-1643).\r\n\r\nIt was in the course of the three centuries during which the Ming\r\ndynasty ruled in China that the greatest advance was made in the\r\nmanufacture of porcelain. When, however, we come to look a little more\r\nclosely, we find that this long period may be shortened by nearly a\r\nhundred years. Before the accession of Yung-lo (1402), and after the\r\ndeath of Wanli (1619), the times were little favourable to the arts of\r\npeace, and even in this shorter period of two centuries there were\r\nintervals, indeed whole reigns, of which there is little to report.\r\n\r\nThe points of chief importance to remember in connection with this\r\ndynasty are--1. That not later than the beginning of the fifteenth\r\ncentury the employment of the oxides of copper and cobalt for decoration\r\nunder the glaze was coming into general use. To this, or perhaps to an\r\nearlier date, we must assign the beginnings of the ware that we in\r\nEngland are wont to consider the most important of all, the great family\r\nof ‘blue and white’ porcelain. 2. That probably about the same time, or\r\nsoon after, the ‘painted glazes,’ as we have called them, were\r\nintroduced. In this ware the colours required for the decoration--the\r\npalette was a very restricted one--were painted directly on the biscuit,\r\nthe piece having been previously fired; it was then re-fired at a\r\nmoderate heat. 3. That at a later period, probably about the middle of\r\nthe sixteenth century, the employment of enamel colours above the glaze\r\nwas introduced, probably under European influence.\r\n\r\nIt is the blue and white that we are above all accustomed to associate\r\nwith the Ming period. But this is not the Chinese point of view. If we\r\nconsult the Bushell manuscript (see chap. v.) we find that Tzu-ching,\r\ntowards the end of the sixteenth century, had in his collection\r\nthirty-nine pieces which he attributed to the reigning dynasty, but of\r\nthese only five or six would be classed by us as ‘blue and white’; at\r\nleast equal importance was given to those decorated with copper-red\r\nunder the glaze, and even more specimens belong to the class of painted\r\nglazes. These latter are chiefly little objects--pen-rests, rouge-pots,\r\nand small wine-jars moulded to represent plant and animal forms, the\r\ngourd or again the persimmon being great favourites. We must not confuse\r\nthese early specimens, dating mostly from the fifteenth and sixteenth\r\ncenturies, with the somewhat similar objects so much sought after by the\r\nFrench collectors in the eighteenth century, which belong for the most\r\npart to the contemporary _famille verte_; on these the decoration is\r\ngiven for the most part by enamels _painted over the glaze_. Still it is\r\nfrom some of these little _magots_ that we can perhaps form the best\r\nidea of the coloured porcelain so prized by Tzu-ching, but of which we\r\nare unable to point to any specimens in our collections.\r\n\r\nIn connection with these painted glazes--for it undoubtedly belongs to\r\nthis class--it may be well to say something of a very decorative ware of\r\nwhich the origin is probably to be placed in early Ming times. The\r\ncolours are distinctly those of the _demi grand feu_, and in this ware\r\nwe have the earliest instance of the use of these colours. This\r\nporcelain occurs most frequently in the shape of vases of baluster\r\noutline with contracted necks and small mouths, or sometimes of the\r\nmore ordinary oil-jar shape, with wide mouths. We may distinguish two\r\ntypes of this ware. In the first the decoration is given by means of a\r\nlow relief of beads and of ribs surrounding countersunk _cloisons_. The\r\nfield between these _cloisons_ is of a deep blue passing into a\r\nblue-black, and the _cloisons_ themselves are filled with a wash of\r\nturquoise or straw-yellow. Chains of pearls in festoon surround the\r\nneck, and from these hang _pendeloques_ of various Buddhist emblems. On\r\nthe body of these vases the decoration often consists of lotus-plants\r\narising from conventional waves.[40] In the second type the turquoise\r\nblue predominates, an impure pale manganese is added, and the jars are\r\noften built up of an open-work trellis of bars. Both the turquoise and\r\naubergine purple porcelain of the Kang-he period, as well as the\r\nJapanese Kishiu ware, may possibly be traced back to a Ming porcelain of\r\nthis class. There are specimens of all these wares in the British Museum\r\nand at South Kensington. In the Salting collection is a jar of the\r\n_cloisonné_ type, the blue-black ground covered with a skin of thin\r\nglaze of a dull surface. This jar was formerly the property of a\r\nJapanese collector (PL. II.).[41]\r\n\r\nThe colours applied _under the glaze_ are confined to cobalt blue and\r\ncopper red. The latter when fine in tint was greatly prized by the\r\nChinese, and we are informed that in the most brilliant specimens the\r\ncolour was given by ‘powdered rubies from the West.’ It was, however, a\r\ntreacherous colour to use, and after the period of Hsuan-te (1425-1435),\r\nwhich was famous for its ruby-red,\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PLATE V._ CHINESE]\r\n\r\nit fell into comparative disuse and was displaced in a measure at a\r\nlater date by a more manageable iron red. The use of the copper\r\nsub-oxide to obtain a red, _sous couverte_, was, however, revived in the\r\ntime of Kang-he. On examples in European collections this red, when used\r\nalone or in connection with blue, is generally of a rather poor maroon\r\ncolour, and it has not found much favour with us. The colour was often\r\nthus applied to the painting of fish, floating, it may be, among blue\r\nwater-weeds. We see it at its best as a monochrome on some little bowls,\r\nenlivened with a floral design in gold, in the British Museum. These\r\ncups and some similar ones at Dresden undoubtedly date from Ming times;\r\nthe ruby tint seen through a brilliant glaze has never been equalled in\r\nlater days. With these we may compare certain little apple-green bowls\r\nsimilarly decorated with gold. One of these in a silver-gilt mounting of\r\nthe early sixteenth century is in the Gold Room at the British Museum\r\n(PL. V.).\r\n\r\n\r\n‘BLUE AND WHITE’ PORCELAIN.\r\n\r\nWhat we somewhat vaguely call ‘blue and white,’ that is porcelain\r\ndecorated under the glaze with designs painted with cobalt blue, has\r\nalways formed the most important class in the eyes of European\r\ncollectors, at least of those of England and Holland. This preference\r\nhas been even more marked with the people of India and Persia, and no\r\nwonder, for no combination of colour more suggestive of coolness could\r\nbe imagined. It has thus come about that this class of ware, more than\r\nany other, has been made with the direct object of exportation. This\r\nblue and white porcelain of China and Japan, which has found its way\r\ninto so many lands both of Europe and Asia, has for centuries had the\r\nprofoundest influence upon the native wares of these countries, whether\r\nof porcelain or of fayence.\r\n\r\nIn China, by the introduction of this process of freely painting with a\r\nbrush upon the surface of the paste, the potters art was for the first\r\ntime brought into contact with that of the painter, and thus fell under\r\nnew influences. The artists of China at that time were divided into many\r\nschools, but what we may call the literary or _dilettante_ influence was\r\npredominant, and this influence is reflected in the subjects treated on\r\nMing porcelain--subjects which, as usual in China, were handed on to the\r\nceramic artists of the next dynasty. The earliest decoration in blue and\r\nwhite in no way followed, as far as we know, the hierated types of the\r\nold bronze ware. Such _motifs_ we do indeed sometimes see repeated on\r\nporcelain, but only on pieces that may safely be attributed to a much\r\nlater date, especially to the pseudo-archaic revival of Yung-cheng’s\r\ntime (1722-35).\r\n\r\nThere is no class of Chinese porcelain to which it is more difficult to\r\nassign even an approximate date than to this blue and white ware. We may\r\nsay at once that the _nien-hao_, or the characters giving the name of\r\nthe dynasty and the emperor, so often found inscribed on the base, are\r\nin the vast majority of cases of no value for fixing the date, and this\r\nis especially true when the name of a Ming emperor is thus found. What\r\nis more, these marks, as far as we can judge (from the knowledge we now\r\npossess derived from other sources), do not, as we might have expected,\r\neven help us in giving hints of the style prevailing at the period\r\nindicated by the date. To take but one example, the reign-mark of\r\nCheng-hua (1464-87) is the one most frequently found on the finest\r\npieces of blue and white (in the Salting collection, for instance), but\r\nby far the greater number of the pieces so marked undoubtedly date from\r\nthe beginning of the eighteenth century. On the other hand, the Chinese\r\nbooks all agree in telling us that this Cheng-hua period was noted for\r\na decline in the excellence of the blue, but on the other hand was\r\npre-eminent for its coloured decoration. It was rather the earlier\r\nHsuan-te period (1425-35) that was renowned for the brilliancy of its\r\nblue. These statements of the Chinese authorities are confirmed by an\r\nanalysis of the Ming specimens illustrated in the Bushell manuscript.\r\nThe Japanese, perhaps a little more rationally, give the preference to\r\nthe reigns of Hsuan-te and Yung-lo (1402-24), for the date-marks of\r\nthese emperors (‘Sentoku’ and ‘Yeiraku’ in the Japanese reading) are to\r\nbe read on the commonest modern blue and white in domestic use in that\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThis is a point that cannot be too strongly dwelt upon. Perhaps if a\r\nlittle more of the care and research that have been devoted to the\r\nreading of these _nien-hao_ and other inscriptions on Chinese porcelain\r\nhad been earlier directed to a careful examination of the glazes and\r\nenamels, and to questions of technique generally, the misconceptions\r\nthat so long prevailed as to the dating and classification of Oriental\r\nporcelain would have been sooner dispelled.\r\n\r\nBut what means have we then for settling the date of a piece of Chinese\r\nblue and white ware? What criterion is there for distinguishing between\r\nspecimens of early Ming, late Ming, or Manchu times?--or indeed between\r\nthose of Chinese and Japanese origin? That we even now possess no very\r\nexact criterion is shown by the wide difference of opinion so often\r\nfound in individual cases. If we are to form our judgment from the rare\r\nextant pieces of blue and white known to have been imported into Europe\r\nin the sixteenth century, we must regard the Ming ware as distinguished\r\nby a certain irregularity of surface, seen best by side-reflected\r\nlights; the pieces are generally moulded, and the marks of the lines of\r\njunction of the moulds are often to be traced on the surface; the paste,\r\ntoo, is generally very thick, and sometimes shows gaping fissures at\r\nthe margin. The drawing of the design is somewhat hasty and summary,\r\nalthough at times distinguished by a freshness of handling and by a\r\ncertain caligraphic freedom. But we must not draw too hasty an inference\r\nfrom the few specimens in our European collections, many of which must\r\nhave been made, as we shall see later on, at a period of temporary\r\ndecline; nor are we justified in regarding mere articles of commerce, as\r\nmost of these specimens undoubtedly were, as representative of the\r\nhigher artistic products of the time.\r\n\r\nThe blue in these early pieces is generally of a full tint but not of\r\nany remarkable quality. There are, however, to be found a few specimens,\r\nheavily moulded indeed and of irregular contour, decorated with cobalt\r\nblue of a full sapphire tint. Of this class there are one or two\r\nbrilliant specimens both in the British Museum and at South Kensington.\r\nIn these and in other Ming wares the surface of the glaze is often\r\ndulled, and this is not always the result of minute scratches, for\r\nsometimes a process of devitrification appears to have set in.[42]\r\nAnother class of Ming ware is distinguished by a decoration delicately\r\npainted in a pale blue tint, and it was this style that was copied by\r\nthe Japanese in their Mikawaji ware of the seventeenth century.\r\n\r\nIt is to later Ming times that we must attribute the bulk of the rough\r\nheavy ware of which so much is found in India.[43] These are generally\r\nlarge plates and bowls, often discoloured from having been used for\r\ncooking purposes. The decoration is hastily executed\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PLATE VI._ CHINESE, BLUE AND WHITE WARE]\r\n\r\nin a dull indigo blue (derived of course from cobalt, as in other\r\ncases), and the outlines are often accentuated by black lines. Many fine\r\nspecimens of this picturesque ware, from the collection of Mrs. Halsey,\r\nwere shown in the exhibition of blue and white ware at the Burlington\r\nFine Arts Club in 1895. It was claimed for one large vase that it came\r\nfrom the palace of the Moguls at Agra, and that it had been presented to\r\nJehangir by the Chinese emperor Wan-li (1572-1619). It is often stated\r\nthat this class of ware was made at some factory in the south of China,\r\nprobably in the neighbourhood of Canton, the port from which doubtless\r\nmost of it was exported. As yet, however, no evidence, as far as I am\r\naware, for such a factory has been brought forward, and no definite\r\nlocality indicated. The statement made by the Abbé Raynal, about a\r\nfactory at Shao-king Fu, rests probably upon a misconception.\r\n\r\nThere are several specimens of blue and white in England, the metal\r\nmountings of which date from the early seventeenth or even from the\r\nsixteenth century. Of these the most famous are the four pieces from\r\nBurleigh House (now belonging to Mr. Pierpont Morgan), which are\r\nbelieved to have been in the possession of the Cecil family from the\r\ntime of Queen Elizabeth. One of these bears the date-mark of Wan-li, the\r\ncontemporary of that queen. This ware is not particularly fine, the\r\nsurfaces are irregular, and all the pieces are apparently moulded (PL.\r\nXXVIII.).\r\n\r\nThis subject, however, of the early presence of Chinese porcelain in\r\nother lands we shall return to in a later chapter.\r\n\r\nSo far, then, with such imperfect lights as are at our command, we have\r\nattempted to follow up the history of porcelain, and so far, say up to\r\nthe middle of the sixteenth century, China is practically the only\r\ncountry with which we are concerned. Some fair imitations of celadon,\r\nthe _martabani_ of Oriental commerce, had probably by this time been\r\nmade in Siam and perhaps elsewhere, and the Japanese were already in a\r\nsporadic way experimenting with imported and native clays. But up to the\r\nsixteenth century the Chinese had practically the monopoly of the art,\r\nand as we have seen they had at that time the command of three processes\r\nof decoration--that is by monochrome glazes, by painting with glazes of\r\na few simple colours on the biscuit, and finally by means of cobalt\r\nblues and copper reds painted on the surface of the raw paste.\r\n\r\nNot but that some attempts may have already been made to apply coloured\r\ndecoration over the glaze--the next and final step in the history of\r\nporcelain. There are some passages in contemporary Chinese books, giving\r\ndescriptions of elaborate subjects painted in many colours on porcelain\r\nof the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, which it would be difficult to\r\napply to our class of painted glazes. Thus--to take a pronounced\r\ninstance from an unexceptionable source--the miniature wine-cups, No. 59\r\nof the Bushell manuscript, are attributed by Tzu-ching to the reign of\r\nCheng-hua (1464-87), and he describes them thus--‘They are painted in\r\nenamel colours’ (so Dr. Bushell translates the original) ‘with flowers\r\nand insects; ... the cockscomb, the narcissus and other flowers, the\r\nflying dragon-fly and crawling mantis are minutely painted after life in\r\ngreen, yellow, and crimson enamel.’ (This, by the way, is a combination\r\nof colours which it must have been difficult to apply at one firing with\r\nthe pigments known at that time.) And yet in the absence of any specimen\r\nof enamelled ware (using the word enamel in its restricted sense for a\r\ndecoration applied over the glaze) that can with certainty be attributed\r\nto so early a period, it will be safer to postpone the date of the\r\nintroduction of this decoration, _sur couverte_, for another hundred\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that the distinctive feature of this decoration\r\nwith enamels is the use of an easily fusible silicate, containing much\r\nlead--in fact a kind of flint glass. A glass of this description is\r\ncapable of being stained by the addition of small quantities of certain\r\nmetallic oxides, some of which would not stand the heat requisite for\r\nthe firing of the porcelain. This, in fact, is the application to\r\nporcelain of the arts of the glass-stainer and of the enameller, arts\r\nalready at this time fully developed in the West. For once the Chinese\r\nauthorities all agree in finding in an exotic and indeed Western art the\r\norigin of their enamelled porcelain. When, however, we attempt to\r\ninterpret their statements we are landed in an even more than customary\r\nchaos--so many are the different readings for the names of foreign\r\ncountries and for technical processes.\r\n\r\nLet us then consider for a moment what the materials were that the\r\nChinese had to draw from--whether from Arab or other sources.\r\n\r\nPutting aside the application of stained glass to windows, for specimens\r\nof this art are not easily exported, these may be summed up as, first,\r\nthe enamelled glass of the Saracens, and secondly, the _cloisonnés_ and\r\n_champlevés_ enamels of the Byzantines and other Western nations.\r\n\r\nAs to the first--the application of coloured and easily fusible enamels\r\nto the surface of glass, which was then exposed to a second firing--this\r\nprocess had been used by the Arabs for the decoration of their mosque\r\nlamps and other vessels probably as early as the twelfth century, and\r\nthis was an art identical in its system with the application of the same\r\ncolours to the surface of porcelain. The beauty of the effect cannot\r\nhave failed to have struck the Chinese if they had had any opportunity\r\nof seeing the finer specimens. But the material was fragile, and apart\r\nfrom a statement by M. Scherer that glass was exported from Aleppo to\r\nChina,[44] I cannot find in the accounts of the Arab trade of the time\r\nany record of such ware being imported into China.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, we know that enamels on metal are first mentioned in\r\nthe Ming annals about the middle of the fifteenth century. They take\r\ntheir name of Cheng-tai enamels from the emperor who reigned at that\r\nperiod; but the proper Chinese term for such enamels is _Folang chien\r\nyao_--‘the inlaid ware of Folang.’ Julien interpreted these words\r\n‘_Porcelaines à incrustations (ornées d’émaux) de France_,’ and Dr.\r\nHirth carries us to Bethlehem! But the word _Folang_ is probably the\r\nsame as the term _Folin_ or _Fulen_, used as early as the sixth century\r\nfor the Roman empire of the East, and it may possibly be connected with\r\nthe Greek πόλις (cf. Stamboul = Εἰς τὴν πόλιν).[45] It is\r\ndefinitely stated by a later Chinese writer that the same colours are\r\nemployed by both the enameller on metal and the decorator of porcelain.\r\n\r\nIf we examine the colours found on both the wares to which we have\r\ntentatively traced back the enamelled porcelain of the Chinese--the\r\nenamels on glass on the one hand, and those on metal on the\r\nother--taking in each case the earlier specimens as examples, we find on\r\nthe mosque lamps from Cairo little except a deep blue generally used as\r\na ground for a design which is outlined in an opaque iron red. On the\r\nfamous flask from Würzburg, now in the British Museum, for which a\r\n‘Mesopotamian’ origin of the thirteenth century is claimed, a turquoise\r\nblue relieved by gilding is the predominant note; there is also a\r\nsparing use of yellow, of an opaque white, and, what is especially\r\ninteresting, of a fine pinkish red, which is possibly obtained from\r\ngold. (The way in which this colour is shaded into the opaque white\r\nreminds us of the similar use of the _rouge d’or_ in later times in\r\nChina.)\r\n\r\nIf, on the other hand, we turn to the earlier Chinese enamels on metal,\r\nthe so-called Ching-tai vases, attributed to the fifteenth century, we\r\nfind among the colours used an opaque iron red, a yellow, an opaque\r\nwhite, and finally two kinds of blue, a turquoise and a full deep blue\r\nthat looks like a cobalt colour.[46]\r\n\r\nSome time, then, during the sixteenth century, whether before or after\r\nthe accession of Wan-li (1572), the Chinese began to decorate the\r\nsurface of their porcelain with jewel-like enamels _appliqués_ to the\r\nglaze. At first, apparently, these colours were confined to three: a\r\ncopper green, a yellow generally of a buff tint, probably containing\r\nantimony as well as iron, and a purple derived from manganese. These are\r\nthe _San-tsai_ or three colours of the Chinese writers, and it will be\r\nseen that they differ from the colour triad of our ‘painted glazes’\r\n(painted, that is, on biscuit and reheated in the _demi grand feu_) in\r\nthat the copper silicate is of a turquoise blue in the latter, and in\r\nthe former of a full leafy green. The Chinese authorities further tell\r\nus that a second scheme of decoration was given by the _Wu-tsai_ or the\r\nfive colours which were made up by the three already mentioned, with the\r\naddition of an opaque red derived from the sesqui-oxide of iron\r\n(otherwise known as hæmatite, bole or red ochre),[47] and finally of a\r\ncobalt blue, _sous couverte_, surviving as it were from the earlier blue\r\nand white ware, for, as we have mentioned, the use of the blue as an\r\nenamel over the glaze belongs to a later period.\r\n\r\nSo much for the teaching of the Chinese books; but when, attacking the\r\nsubject from the other side, we examine the specimens of enamelled ware\r\nwhich for one reason or another--the coarseness and thickness of the\r\npaste, the moulded form, and the irregular surface--we should be\r\ninclined to attribute to the Ming dynasty, we are led to classify these\r\nearlier examples somewhat as follows:--\r\n\r\n1. On a white ground a design, often, it would seem, of textile origin,\r\nroughly painted in an opaque red (like sealing-wax), with the addition\r\nof a leafy green and very rarely of a little yellow. This is a class of\r\ndecoration much imitated in Japan at a later date, especially by the\r\nartist potters of Kioto and at Inuyama.\r\n\r\n2. The same colours with the addition of blue, _sous couverte_. The\r\ndesign often takes the form of figures in a landscape, the whole broadly\r\ntreated. The earliest type of the Imari ware (apart from the Kakiyemon)\r\nseems to be based on this scheme of decoration.\r\n\r\nBoth these classes are distinguished by the white ground, the sparing\r\nuse of yellow, and the almost complete absence of manganese purple and\r\nturquoise blue.\r\n\r\n3. A transparent enamel of leafy green, yellow and manganese purple\r\npainted on in washes so as to cover the whole ground. When with these\r\ncolours we find the outline drawn in black, we have the basis of a large\r\npart of the _famille verte_. On the other hand, it is this class of\r\ndecoration which probably carries on the tradition of the early Ming\r\nware, sometimes described as ‘enamelled,’ but more probably all of it\r\npainted on the biscuit and fired in the _demi grand feu_.\r\n\r\nIn China it would seem that these enamelled wares\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PLATE VII._ CHINESE]\r\n\r\nwere at first treated with a certain disfavour, if not with contempt, at\r\nleast by the more cultivated classes. During Ming times, though\r\nporcelain thus decorated was doubtless made at King-te-chen, it was, at\r\nleast up to the latter part of the reign of Wan-li, chiefly made in\r\nprivate factories. In fact we find a censor, in the reign of that\r\nemperor, protesting against the use of enamel colours (the _wu-tsai_) in\r\nthe porcelain supplied to the palace (Bushell, p. 241).\r\n\r\nWe have now sketched out a description of the various kinds of porcelain\r\nmade during the course of the Ming dynasty, and before going on at once\r\nto an account of the period associated with King-te-chen and the great\r\nrulers of the Manchu dynasty, it will be well to extract a few notes on\r\npoints that may interest us from the somewhat voluminous records and\r\ndescriptions of the porcelain of Ming times found in the books of the\r\nChinese authorities.[48]\r\n\r\nYUNG-LO (1402-24).[49]--This great emperor, who sent out ships for\r\nconquest and for commerce as far as Ceylon, is for us especially\r\nassociated with a white eggshell porcelain of which there are two\r\nremarkable specimens in the British Museum (see above, p. 67). Bowls of\r\nthis thinness must have been pared down on the lathe, after throwing on\r\nthe wheel, in the manner described on p. 22, until a mere translucent\r\nghost of the original body was left, so that the name _to-t’ai_ or\r\n‘bodiless,’ by which this ware is known to the Chinese, is not\r\ninappropriate. The earliest blue and white porcelain of which there is\r\nany definite record was made in this reign, but the evidence for this\r\nis, of course, purely ‘documentary.’ The quality of the blue is said to\r\nhave been surpassed only by that of the Hsuan-te and Cheng-hua periods.\r\n\r\nHSUAN-TE (1425-35).--The short reign of this emperor is connected in the\r\nmind of the Chinese with the finest works both of the metal worker and\r\nthe potter. This period gave its name to the famous pale bronze so\r\nadmired in later days by the Japanese.[50] The blue of the Hsuan-te\r\nperiod, unsurpassed in later times, we are told, was derived from Arab\r\nsources, for the famous _Su-ni-po_ and _Su-ma-li_ blues are first\r\nmentioned at this time. The word _Su-ma-li_ has been compared with the\r\nlow Latin _Smaltum_, the prepared silicate of cobalt used by the\r\nmediæval glass-stainers, but from the description of this substance in\r\nthe Chinese books, it would seem rather to have been of the nature of a\r\nnative ore. When, however, we read in the same books of the origin of\r\nthe brilliant red for which this reign was equally famous, how it was\r\nprepared from ‘powdered rubies of the West,’ we see how little reliance\r\nwe can place in their accounts. This red, derived of course from the\r\nsub-oxide of copper, was applied either to cover the whole surface, as\r\nin the little bowls mentioned on p. 81 (‘painted on the biscuit,’ says\r\nDr. Bushell, but is this necessarily so?), or for the painting of a\r\ndesign in this case both alone and in combination with blue. We hear\r\nalso of large jars and garden seats of a coarse porcelain, with dark\r\nblue and turquoise ground and decoration of ribbed cloisons, which were\r\nfirst made in this reign. Of this class we have spoken at length when\r\ntreating of the ‘painted glazes.‘[51] Of what nature the decoration in\r\nfive colours, which is also referred to this reign, may have been, it\r\nis difficult to say--we have no specimen so painted that we can assign\r\nto so old a period, but in this connection we certainly must not think\r\nof enamels painted over the glaze.\r\n\r\nCHENG-TUNG reigned from 1435 to 1449; he was then captured by the\r\nMongols, and during the five years of his imprisonment his brother\r\nCheng-tai reigned in his stead. When Cheng-tung returned from his\r\ncaptivity he adopted a fresh name.[52] This is the only instance of a\r\ndouble nien-hao in later Chinese history. We hear of Cheng-tai in\r\nconnection with the introduction of enamels on metal, but for the\r\nhistory of porcelain both reigns are a blank.\r\n\r\nCHENG-HUA (1464-87).--This is a name familiar to collectors. It is found\r\nmore frequently than any other on highly finished vases dating really\r\nfrom the eighteenth century. Strangely enough, this is the favourite\r\nmark on the finest blue and white of this later time, although, as we\r\nhave already pointed out, the Chinese books tell us that, the sources of\r\nthe foreign cobalt blue being in Cheng-hua’s time exhausted, more\r\nattention was given to coloured decoration. This was the time of the\r\nfamous ‘chicken-cups,’ for which such fabulous sums were given. These\r\ncups are described as decorated with the wu-tsai or five colours; and\r\nthe subject painted on them, a hen and chickens by the side of a\r\nflowering peony-bush, reminds one of the enamelled egg-shell cups of\r\nKien-lung (1735-95). The Ming cups were copied, we are told, at that\r\ntime; but it is difficult to connect this early ware, of which\r\nunfortunately we possess no specimen, with the delicate enamel\r\ndecoration of the _famille rose_.[53]\r\n\r\nHUNG-CHI (1487-1505).--This name appears especially on the back of\r\nbowls in association with a yellow glaze of various shades, and, in\r\nagreement this time with the material evidence, the Chinese books\r\nmention this yellow as a speciality of the reign. Not that we can regard\r\nall yellow ware with this mark as even of this dynasty; like other Ming\r\nware it was imitated in the eighteenth century. The yellow varies from\r\nthe pale brown of the raw chestnut to a full gamboge tint. There is at\r\nSouth Kensington a dish or shallow bowl with a full yellow glaze; on the\r\nback beside the nien-hao of Hung-chi, a Persian inscription and a date\r\ncorresponding to the sixteenth century has been cut in the paste.\r\n\r\nCHENG-TE (1505-21).--The decoration of blue on a white ground is said to\r\nhave been revived in this reign. A new material, the _hui-ching_[54] or\r\nMohammedan blue, was obtained from Yun-nan. In connection with this, we\r\ncan point to a curious collection of bronze and porcelain, with both\r\nArabic and Chinese inscriptions, made probably for Mohammedan Chinese.\r\nThese objects were obtained by the late Sir A. W. Franks from Pekin, and\r\nare now in the British Museum. Among them there are several pieces of\r\nblue and white with the Cheng-te year-mark.[55] On one of these pieces\r\nthe Persian word for ‘writing-case’ forms part of the decoration (PL.\r\nVIII.). It is in this reign that we hear for the first time of the\r\noppression exercised by the court officials upon the potters of\r\nKing-te-chen, and now also we find the court eunuchs in the highest\r\npositions,--the great days of the Ming dynasty are already passed.\r\n\r\nKIA-TSING (1521-66).--The name of this emperor is often found on blue\r\nand white porcelain, and it is a favourite one with the Japanese\r\nimitators. Some\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PLATE VIII._ CHINESE, BLUE AND WHITE WARE]\r\n\r\nspecimens in our collections, of a fine sapphire blue (the colour is\r\nindeed often inclined to run), may perhaps be referred to this reign.\r\nThe demands for the court were very extensive, and if we are to trust\r\nthe list of articles quoted by Dr. Bushell from the Fou-liang annals,\r\nthe porcelain made for the palace during this period was, with the\r\nexception of a little of that with a brown ground, confined to blue and\r\nwhite ware.\r\n\r\nLUNG-KING (1566-72).--The bad reputation of this emperor is reflected in\r\nthe porcelain of the time--indeed the erotic character of the decoration\r\nis the one point noted in the annals. The mark of this reign is rarely\r\nfound. There is, however, in the British Museum a large square support\r\nor plinth, decorated with a blue of magnificent sapphire hue, which\r\nbears the Lung-king nien-hao.\r\n\r\nWAN-LI (1572-1619).--Of the porcelain surviving from Ming times, a very\r\nlarge proportion probably belongs to this reign. It was now that the\r\nEuropean trade was beginning to reach large proportions, and the\r\nexportation both to India and Persia was greater than ever. It was a\r\ntime above all for the manufacture of large pieces, but we must not look\r\nany longer for the refinement and scholarly traditions of earlier Ming\r\nperiods. Dr. Bushell tells us that large bowls of the Wan-li ware are\r\nstill in use in the shops and stalls of Pekin. For us the difficulty is\r\nto distinguish the blue and white ware of this reign from that made for\r\nexportation during the next half century, a period during which the\r\nannals of the Chinese authorities are a blank. The reign of Wan-li is\r\nabove all the period during which the use of enamel colours became\r\nprevalent, and now, for the first time, some of the ware made for the\r\npalace was, in spite of the protests of the censor, so decorated. But we\r\nwill reserve what we have to say on the origin of Chinese enamelled ware\r\nuntil we come to treat of the progress made in the reign of Kang-he.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE PORCELAIN OF CHINA--(_continued_).\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MANCHU OR TSING DYNASTY (1643--).\r\n\r\nKANG-HE.--After the death of Wan-li, in 1619, there is a long gap in the\r\nhistory of Chinese porcelain. Some twenty years later, the last emperor\r\nof the native dynasty was driven out by the Manchu Tatars, and the\r\ndynasty which still reigns in the country was founded. But neither\r\nduring the reign of the first emperor of the new Tsing or ‘Pure’\r\ndynasty, nor indeed during the first part of the long reign of his great\r\nsuccessor Kang-he (1661-1722), was much attention given to the imperial\r\nfactory at King-te-chen. The early years of Kang-he’s reign were\r\noccupied with quelling the last efforts of the native Chinese party. We\r\nmay date the revival of active work from the appointment of Tsang\r\nYing-hsuan,[56] in the year 1683, to the post of superintendent at the\r\nporcelain works. It was then, after an interval of more than sixty\r\nyears--almost a blank in the history of Chinese porcelain--that the\r\ngreat renaissance set in, and we may date from that time the beginning\r\nof the last great stage in that history--a stage which was to last for\r\nanother hundred years. During that period a succession of able and\r\nenthusiastic men were in charge of the imperial works. With the support\r\nof the great emperors who ruled in China for three long generations,\r\nthey were able to bring the manufacture of porcelain to a point of\r\nperfection reached neither before nor since, and to produce that\r\nwonderful series of vases, bowls, and plates that now fill the museums\r\nand private collections of Europe and America.\r\n\r\nIt will perhaps be better to carry on our hasty historical sketch down\r\nto the period of decline at the end of the eighteenth century, before\r\nturning to the letters of the Père D’Entrecolles and his account of the\r\ngreat city of the potter--King-te-chen. We shall then be in a better\r\nposition to understand the almost endless series of different wares that\r\nwere turned out from the kilns of that town in the eighteenth century.\r\nWe can finally make a rapid survey of the porcelain of China, picking up\r\nmany threads that have been dropped in the course of our historical\r\nreview.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the Chinese authorities when describing the coloured\r\nware of the Ming period speak of two ‘triads’ of colours. One, the\r\n_turquoise_, purple and yellow group, we have identified with the ware\r\npainted on the biscuit and reheated in the _demi grand feu_; while the\r\nother, the _green_, purple and yellow class may be regarded as one of\r\nthe earliest forms of true enamel or muffle decoration. These two\r\nclasses were now in the earlier days of Kang-he brought to greater\r\nperfection, and as by this time we have come to a period when the finer\r\nwares began to be largely exported direct to Europe, we meet with many\r\nspecimens of these wares in our collections.\r\n\r\nIn the first of these groups the _Turquoise_ is the predominant\r\ncolour--indeed it is often found alone (PL. IX.). As a monochrome ware\r\nit is distinguished by a fine crackle, which is always present but is\r\noften only to be seen by a close examination. How much it is sought\r\nafter by collectors is shown by the fact mentioned by Dr. Bushell, that\r\nin the Walters collection there are more than a hundred specimens of\r\nthis monochrome blue, and of these the majority probably date from the\r\nreign of Kang-he. A combination of this turquoise with aubergine purple\r\nderived from manganese was in favour at this time not only for the\r\nlittle _magots_ and for small vases, but also for larger decorative\r\npieces as well as for tables and stands for other objects. It was above\r\nall this combination that was copied by Zengoro and others for the\r\n‘Oniwa’ ware of the Princes of Kishiu, and some of this Japanese\r\nporcelain is very difficult to distinguish from the Chinese original.\r\nThe aubergine purple, like the turquoise, always finely crackled, is\r\nseldom found alone in Chinese examples, but this is often the case on\r\nthe Kishiu ware. The third colour of the triad, the yellow, is quite\r\nsubordinate; there were evidently great difficulties in producing a fine\r\ntint under the conditions of the _demi grand feu_. In like manner in the\r\nearly Ming ware, that with the ribbed cloisons, the yellow was only used\r\nsparingly for the petals of a flower or for a chain of pearls. It should\r\nbe noted that this ware of Kang-he differs from its Ming predecessor in\r\nthe absence of the dark blue glaze.\r\n\r\nFAMILLE VERTE.--In the first triad, that of the _demi grand feu_, the\r\nturquoise blue, as we have seen, is the predominant colour. Its place is\r\ntaken in the triad of the muffle-stove by the green, which in many\r\nshades of intensity, but with a prevailing leafy hue, has come to be\r\nespecially associated with the enamelled wares of this reign.[57]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PLATE IX._ CHINESE]\r\n\r\nIt would be possible to make many subdivisions of this class--the\r\nwell-known _famille verte_. In the majority of cases the ground is\r\ncovered by a wash of one of the colours, so as to resemble a painted\r\nglaze. It will, however, always be found on close examination that the\r\nwash is _superimposed_ on the true colourless glaze, which may generally\r\nbe seen at the mouth and foot. A green of greater or lesser strength,\r\nsometimes quite a thin wash, is the commonest colour for this ground; at\r\nother times it is of a pale straw colour, or, more rarely, a purple of a\r\npoor uncertain hue.[58]\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that in the muffle-stove the fine aubergine purple\r\nthat we noted in the class last described is rarely to be obtained from\r\nmanganese. In all cases the white ground is only left sparingly as a\r\nreserve for the petals of flowers and for the faces. In addition to\r\nthese colours--the green, the yellow, and the purple--which are for the\r\nmost part used as washes, a dark brown or black is largely employed for\r\noutlining the details of the decoration, as well as for tempering the\r\ncolour of the background by covering it with scrolls and spirals.\r\n\r\nWhen this decoration is applied to the small moulded pieces--the\r\n_magots_, for instance, so admired by the French collectors of the\r\neighteenth century--we have a class of objects to which the descriptions\r\n(in the Bushell manuscript and elsewhere) of the decorated ware of the\r\nfifteenth and early sixteenth centuries would seem to apply. As we have\r\nseen, it is at the least very doubtful whether these early pieces were\r\ndecorated _over the glaze_, but in a general view it cannot fail to\r\nstrike one that the Kang-he decoration, in which washes of colour[59]\r\nplay so important a part, belongs to an earlier school than that of the\r\nWan-li porcelain, with its designs and medallions scattered over a white\r\nground. These last patterns are, it would seem, derived from textile\r\nfabrics, from the rich brocades of the time, both Chinese and, possibly,\r\nforeign. In the _famille verte_ of Kang-he’s time, on the other hand, we\r\nmay perhaps see a return, in general effect at least, to the _san-tsai_\r\nand _wu-tsai_ painted glazes of earlier Ming time.\r\n\r\nWhen in place of the wash of green (or may be of yellow) the background\r\nis formed by a black enamel, we still feel the prevailing influence of\r\nthe green in the decoration, so that these black-ground vases are\r\nrightly included in the _famille verte_. The black background itself is\r\noften of a greenish quality, and in the designs the camellia-leaf green\r\nis predominant; yellow and purple are but sparingly introduced, but the\r\neffect is heightened by the white reserves (PL. X.). In many cases a\r\nwash of green appears to have been carried over the black ground. This\r\ngreen enamel may be often seen overlapping, as it were, on the foot of a\r\nvase.\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult to find in the whole range of Chinese porcelain\r\nanything more superbly decorative\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PLATE X_ CHINESE]\r\n\r\nthan some of these large black-grounded vases in the Salting collection.\r\nWe would call attention to one example on which the thin skin-like glaze\r\nof the dull ground and the somewhat archaic drawing of the great dragon\r\nthat curls round the side suggest a date earlier than that of its\r\ncompanions (PL. XI.). And yet these fine vases are wanting in two\r\nelements which we are accustomed to regard as essential to the best\r\nporcelain: they neither display to any extent the natural white colour\r\nof the paste,[60] nor is the outline dependent on the motion of the clay\r\nunder the potter’s hand. Nearly all these vases, as indeed most of the\r\nlarge vessels of this time, are built up from segments made in moulds.\r\n\r\nWhat rich effects of colour are here obtained with a palette so\r\nrestricted! Perhaps not a little of the beauty of this decoration is due\r\nto this very restriction. It will be noticed that we have in the more\r\ncharacteristic examples a total absence of all shades both of red and of\r\nblue.\r\n\r\nIn the other not less important division of the enamel decoration of\r\nthis time these last two colours are added, and we come again to a\r\npentad of colours--not, however, quite the same as the _wu-tsai_ of\r\nWan-li times. We are still under the influence of the _famille verte_:\r\nthe leafy green in two or more shades remains the predominant colour,\r\nthe opaque red is used more sparingly than in the later Ming enamelled\r\nware, and above all the cobalt blue is now used _as an enamel colour\r\nover the glaze_. This latter use points to an important advance in\r\ntechnique, and it affords an easy means of distinguishing the wares of\r\nthe two periods. The new method of employing the blue is, however, often\r\nonly to be recognised by close examination in a favourable light. What\r\nat once distinguishes the newer ware is rather the displacement of the\r\nopaque red of the Ming porcelain by the characteristic green of the\r\nKang-he time as the _dominant_ colour. When this full complement of five\r\ncolours is used, the general scheme of the design, however, follows more\r\non the lines of the Wan-li ware; we find sprays of flowers or figure\r\nsubjects relieved upon the white ground. But the drawing of the newer\r\nware is somewhat more realistic, and there is generally a greater\r\nfinish. In rare cases the five colours are combined with the black\r\nground, as may be seen on two large vases in the British Museum, but the\r\neffect is not so happy as that obtained with a simpler range of colours.\r\n\r\nThere is another position in which these five enamel colours may be\r\nfound together--in the decoration of the white reserves left between\r\ngrounds of _bleu poudré_ and _fond laque_. This was a form of decoration\r\nmuch admired in Europe, and one of the earliest imitated. This _fond\r\nlaque_ ware of various shades, with reserved panels decorated with\r\nflowers or figures, has retained among dealers the designation of\r\nBatavian porcelain, a name which, like our old terms Gombroon and East\r\nIndian, throws light on the route by which it reached Europe. The deep\r\nblue vases covered with elaborate designs in gold were also exported\r\nbefore the end of the seventeenth century; of these large specimens have\r\nbeen sometimes found in India. There is a tall vase of this ware in the\r\nIndian Museum at South Kensington--the gilding, as is often the case,\r\nhas almost entirely disappeared.\r\n\r\nIn the historical development of our subject, which we are now following\r\nwith greater or less strictness, we are only concerned with important\r\ndevelopments and fresh types as they from time to time arise. We have\r\ntherefore little to say for the present of the blue and white and of the\r\nwares with monochrome glazes of which we\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate XI.\r\n\r\n_Chinese. Black ground._]\r\n\r\nhave so many superb specimens dating from the reign of Kang-he. We must,\r\nhowever, mention in passing the brilliant _sang de bœuf_ vases\r\nespecially associated with the early years of this emperor. As in the\r\ncase of the ‘transmutation’ or _flambé_ glazes, the deep red colour of\r\nthis ware is produced by the action of a reducing flame upon a silicate\r\nof copper. It is known in China as Lang yao, and there has been some\r\nmisconception as to the origin of the term. If, as the best authorities\r\ntell us, we are to derive the name from Lang Ting-tso, the famous\r\nviceroy of the Two Kiangs (the provinces of Kiangsi and Kiangnan) at the\r\ntime of the accession of Kang-he, the earliest form of this Lang yao\r\nmust be associated with a period (say about the years 1654-1668) which\r\nis otherwise quite sterile in the annals of Chinese porcelain.\r\n\r\nYUNG-CHENG (1722-1735).--When in 1722, after a reign of more than sixty\r\nyears, Kang-he,[61] perhaps the greatest of all the emperors of China,\r\ndied, we find a note of alarm sounded by the Jesuit fathers. Unlike his\r\nfather, Yung-cheng the new emperor was regarded as a supporter of the\r\nmost conservative traditions, and no friend of the Christian\r\nmissionaries. What, however, is important to us is the fact that as\r\ncrown-prince he was known not only as a patron of the works at\r\nKing-te-chen, but as himself an amateur potter of distinction. The Père\r\nD’Entrecolles, writing before Yung-cheng’s accession to the throne,\r\ntells us that it was his habit to send down from Pekin examples of\r\nancient wares to be copied at the imperial factory. This influence,\r\nexercised in a conservative direction, is reflected in the porcelain\r\nproduced during his reign.\r\n\r\nThis is indeed a critical point in the history of Chinese porcelain. We\r\nare reminded of some similar periods in the development of our Western\r\narts, when it begins to become evident that a command of material and a\r\ntechnical finish have been attained at the expense of all spontaneity\r\nand freshness of expression. Some such tendency was accompanied at this\r\ntime in China by a careful and deliberate imitation of ancient forms and\r\nglazes. Under Nien Hsi-yao, the new superintendent at King-te-chen, some\r\nadvance was certainly made--we shall speak of the _Nien yao_ and the new\r\ncolours that distinguished it directly. We must not overlook, however,\r\nthe influence of the foreign demand which more and more made itself\r\nfelt, an influence opposed to the conservative and classical tastes of\r\nthe emperor.\r\n\r\nBut when we run through the long list, under fifty-seven headings, of\r\nthe various wares copied at King-te-chen at this time,[62] we see how\r\nstrong this classical influence was. In fact, this catalogue is one of\r\nour best sources of information for the ancient, and especially for the\r\nSung, wares. The chief concern of the compiler was with the glazes, for\r\nno attempt seems to have been made to copy the thick and rough pastes of\r\nthe early days.[63] We can infer from some of the heads of the list that\r\nmost of the highly perfected glazes of the day, ranging through every\r\nshade of colour, were considered to be but modifications of the old\r\nsimple glazes of Sung times. This was an essentially Chinese way of\r\nlooking at the matter, and by this indirect path it was possible to\r\nreach the most novel effects. Among the later headings of Nien’s list\r\n(it was to some extent chronologically arranged) we find mention of\r\ncopies of Japanese wares, and frequent reference is made to colours and\r\ndecorations of European origin. We shall have to make more than one\r\nreference to this important catalogue in a later chapter.\r\n\r\nIt was under the _régime_ of Nien Hsi-yao that this list was drawn up.\r\nHe was the second of the great viceroys whose names are associated with\r\nthe emperors Kang-he, Yung-cheng, and Kien-lung respectively. He\r\nsucceeded to Tsang Ying-hsuan, and was followed in the next reign by\r\nTang-ying. The wares made during the administration of these\r\nsuperintendents are known in chronological order as _Tsang yao_, _Nien\r\nyao_, and _Tang yao_. This Nien did not regard his post by any means as\r\na sinecure. He frequently visited the works, and required samples of the\r\nimperial ware to be sent every two months to his official residence for\r\ninspection (Bushell, p. 361).\r\n\r\nThe _Nien yao_, to the Chinese collector, is especially associated with\r\ncertain monochrome glazes--above all with the _clair de lune_--the _yueh\r\npai_ or ‘moon-white,’ and with a brilliant red glaze with stippled\r\nsurface, a near cousin to the _sang de bœuf_ and _flambé_ classes. There\r\nis another ‘self-glaze’ ware which dates from this time, of which the\r\nmingled tints depend, as in the case of the _flambé_, upon the varying\r\ndegrees of oxidation of the copper in the glaze. This is the\r\n‘peach-bloom,’ the ‘apple red and green’ of the Chinese. The charm of\r\nthis delicate ware is of another kind to that to be found in the\r\nvigorous flashes of colour of the transmutation glazes.\r\n\r\nWe can trace at this time the gradual introduction of two new colours\r\nthat give so special a character to the wares of the next reign. I mean\r\nthe pink derived from gold and the lemon-yellow. These colours were used\r\nsparingly and with great delicacy at first, but we come to associate\r\nthem at a later time with a period of decline and of bad taste.\r\n\r\nKIEN-LUNG (1735-1795).--It was during the long reign of this emperor,\r\npoet and patron of all the arts, that the new direction which we find\r\ngiven to the porcelain made in the reign of his father, Yung-cheng,\r\nbecame even more accentuated--on the one hand, the copying of old glazes\r\nand the employment of archaic hieratic patterns for decoration, on the\r\nother, the more and more frequent use of new colours and new designs of\r\nnon-Chinese origin. This latter tendency was fostered both by the\r\neclectic tastes of Kien-lung himself and also by the increasing\r\nimportance of the demand for foreign countries. Great care was given to\r\nthe paste--it was required to be of a snowy (or rather sometimes chalky)\r\nwhiteness, tending neither towards yellow nor towards blue, and so\r\ncarefully finished on the lathe that on the uniform glassy surface of\r\nthe finer specimens no signs were left of the movement of the potter’s\r\nwheel;[64] for compared with the ware produced in Ming times, and even\r\nduring the reign of Kang-he, we now note the greater proportion of\r\npieces thrown on the wheel. At no time has the skill of the potter who\r\nthrew the clay, and of the workman who then pared and smoothed the\r\nsurface on the lathe, been brought to a greater perfection, and this\r\napplies not only to the eggshell china, but to the large vases and\r\nbeakers, so perfect in their outline. The same perfection of technique\r\nis found in the decoration, so that a blue and white vase of this period\r\ncan at once be recognised in spite of the pseudo-archaic decoration and\r\nthe Ming _nien hao_ inscribed on the base. When the new colours are\r\nintroduced the date is, of course, approximately fixed, and we may\r\nprobably associate with the beginning of this reign (or perhaps a little\r\nearlier; see note on p. 110) the first use of the _rouge d’or_ which has\r\ngiven its name to a well-known class of porcelain--the _famille rose_.\r\n\r\nA manageable red had long been a desideratum. There was no more\r\ntreacherous material than the basic copper oxide, whether painted under\r\nor mixed with the glaze. As an over-glaze source of red this pigment was\r\nof course unavailable, while the opaque brick-like tints obtained from\r\niron, though in keeping with the rougher, picturesque decoration of\r\nearly times, did not harmonise well with the delicate style of painting\r\nnow in fashion,[65] so that it is not surprising that the beautiful pink\r\ntint obtained from gold carried all before it. The gold was probably\r\nincorporated with the enamel flux in the form of purple of Cassius,\r\nwhich is readily prepared by dissolving gold in a mixture of nitric acid\r\nand sal-ammoniac and adding some fragments of tin. The colour had been\r\nknown for some time in Europe--we can perhaps even trace this pink tint\r\non enamelled Arab glass of the fourteenth century (see p. 89).[66] A\r\nvery small quantity of this material goes a long way, especially when\r\nused to give a gradated tint to a white opaque enamel, as on the petal\r\nof a flower. As a colour it is singularly harmonious, and in a period of\r\ndecline helped to ‘keep together’ the motley array of enamels used along\r\nwith it.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing more popular in the work of this time than the little\r\negg-shell plates, decorated with flowers and birds, for which such high\r\nprices are given by collectors. The original type, for both ware and\r\ndecoration, is probably in this case to be found in the ‘chicken-cups’\r\nof Cheng-hua’s reign.\r\n\r\nOn the plates of this ware the borders are filled with elaborate and\r\nminutely finished diapers and scrolls, evidently taken from silk\r\nbrocades; indeed, the gold threads of the woof are sometimes directly\r\nimitated; the centre is occupied by a picture, either a flower piece or\r\na _genre_ figure scene (PL. XII.). We may connect these designs with the\r\nworks of the naturalistic colour school of the time, many of the finest\r\nof which have been preserved by Japanese collectors. A very frequent\r\nsubject is a rocky bank from which grow peonies, narcissi, or other\r\nflowers, and under which two or more chickens or sometimes quails are\r\ngrouped. The petals of the flowers are rendered by a white opaque enamel\r\nin high relief, often with a flush of pink, imitating the _tour de\r\nforce_ by which the painters of the time, by a single stroke of the\r\nbrush, produced a full gradation of colour. Indeed, the same artists\r\ndoubtless painted both on silk, on paper, and on porcelain. We may\r\ncompare their work to that of the fan-painters and miniaturists who were\r\nemployed to decorate the panels of Sèvres porcelain, at this very time,\r\nwith pastoral scenes and flower pieces. The Chinese enamellers rarely\r\nsigned their work; but there is a plate in the British Museum with the\r\nname of a Canton artist. This gives a hint as to where most of the work\r\nwas done. But the most remarkable instance of signed work of this period\r\nis found on a series of large plates in the Dresden Museum. On these a\r\nChinese artist, some time before the middle of the eighteenth century,\r\nhas painted a series of designs of birds and flowers, and in one\r\ninstance at least a graceful female figure. On the field, in each case,\r\nwe find a seal character (accompanied either by a smaller mark contained\r\nin a circle, or by an artemisia leaf) which indicates the painter’s\r\nname. With true artistic feeling he has succeeded in filling the surface\r\nof the plate with a graceful decoration, and at the same time he gives\r\nus a series of delightful pictures, employing the full range of the\r\nenamel colours at his command. And in thus combining a decorative design\r\nwith an accurate\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PLATE XII_ CHINESE]\r\n\r\nrendering of natural objects, the Chinese artist has succeeded in doing\r\nwhat has never been accomplished by any European painter on porcelain.\r\n\r\nIn decoration of this kind, however, only the very best work pleases; in\r\nanything below this we get at once to what is vulgar and trite; and the\r\nlarger palette now at the painter’s command only makes it easier for him\r\nto produce the unpleasant combinations of colours so frequent in the\r\nwares exported from China after the end of the eighteenth century. On\r\nthe other hand, the older painters, confined to their three or at most\r\nfive colours, seldom fail to produce an agreeable effect, however\r\nroughly their colours are daubed on.\r\n\r\nIn the _genre_ scenes, as in the case of the flower pieces, a realistic\r\ntendency is prominent. We have no longer the Taoist saints or the\r\nhunting and battle pieces of earlier times, but delicately executed\r\ninteriors with graceful figures of girls arranging flowers or painting\r\nfans, or again, landscapes with men travelling by road or by river.\r\nThere is a refinement of colour and a charm of drawing and composition\r\nin the better specimens of this somewhat effeminate school that appeals\r\nto every one. It is difficult for us to find any marked European\r\ninfluence in the designs of this time, and yet these pictures are\r\nclassed by the Chinese as European in style; and it is not quite clear\r\nwhether this refers only to the enamel colours employed or to the manner\r\nof drawing as well. Most of the work of this kind was doubtless made for\r\nthe European market and painted at Canton. But is this the case with the\r\nfinest examples? Kien-lung himself was, it would seem, no despiser of\r\nthis carefully decorated ware. A poem of his composition, signed with\r\nthe vermilion seal, is often found on this egg-shell porcelain.\r\n\r\nOn some of the most highly finished of the little cups and plates we\r\nfind an elaborate scroll decoration in gold and sometimes in silver; and\r\nin these designs we may perhaps trace the influence of the baroque\r\nstyle in vogue at this time in Europe.\r\n\r\nNien resigned his post when his master in the year 1735 had ‘flown up to\r\nheaven like a dragon,’ and the new emperor, Kien-lung, appointed in his\r\nplace Tang-ying, who had long served under him. The new director was no\r\nless an enthusiast than his predecessor. He tells us in his memoirs--for\r\nhe was a man of literary taste like his master, Kien-lung--that he\r\nserved his apprenticeship with the workmen, sharing his meals and his\r\nsleeping-room with them, following in this the proverb which says ‘the\r\nfarmer may learn something from his bondman, and the weaver from the\r\nhandmaid who holds the thread for her mistress.’\r\n\r\nWe hear that new tints of turquoise (_fei-tsui_) and of rose-red\r\n(_mei-kwei_) were introduced by him, and we may perhaps identify these\r\ncolours with certain shades of pink and turquoise blue that became\r\nprevalent about this time. In both these cases the pigment is mixed with\r\nsome amount of arsenic or tin so that the enamel is nearly opaque, and\r\nthis enamel is now spread over the ground, taking the place of the glaze\r\nwhich lies beneath. The effect, though apparently admired by some\r\ncollectors, is heavy and unpleasant. The pink, which we may consider as\r\na Chinese equivalent of the _rose Pompadour_ (it is uncertain whether\r\nthe French or the Chinese were the first to use the _rouge d’or_\r\ncolours), is generally more or less opaque, with a granular surface; it\r\nis often found covering a paste inscribed with fine scrolls.[67]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PLATE XIII._ CHINESE]\r\n\r\nIn the case of the pale opaque blue (to which the name of turquoise may\r\nbe applied more aptly than to the sky-coloured transparent blues of the\r\n_demi grand feu_), the surface of the enamel is sometimes painted with\r\nan irregular net-work of black lines, as if in imitation of some kind of\r\nmarble. This turquoise enamel towards the end of Kien-lung’s reign was\r\noften applied to the surface of large vases, and when in combination\r\nwith a lemon-yellow decoration the effect is even more unpleasant than\r\nwhen used alone.\r\n\r\nWe have mentioned, when speaking of Yung-cheng’s reign, a valuable list\r\nof the various kinds of porcelain made at that time at King-te-chen. We\r\nmust now refer to another document, quoted, like the list of Nien’s\r\ntime, in all the Chinese books dealing with the history of the imperial\r\nporcelain works. The emperor Kien-lung, it would appear, when\r\noverhauling certain manuscripts preserved in the palace, came upon a\r\nseries of twenty water-colour drawings illustrating the manufacture of\r\nporcelain. He at once summoned Tang-ying, the famous superintendent at\r\nKing-te-chen, to Pekin, and, handing over the drawings, commanded him to\r\nprepare a full description of all the processes illustrated in these\r\npictures. This was in 1743, shortly before Tang’s retirement. The\r\ndrawings themselves have never been made public; but we have in Tang’s\r\nreport what is, after the letters of the Jesuit father, our most\r\nimportant source for the technical details of the manufacture of\r\nporcelain in China. With these details we are not concerned just now,\r\nbut we will quote from Dr. Bushell’s translation a disquisition on\r\ncertain principles that should govern the forms and decoration of\r\nporcelain. This is a kind of _obiter dictum_ of Tang-ying, _à propos_ of\r\nthe fashioning and painting of vases. In his flowery style he tells us\r\n(I abbreviate in a few places): ‘In the decoration of porcelain correct\r\ncanons of art should be followed. The designs should be taken from the\r\npatterns of old brocades and embroidery; the colours from a garden as\r\nseen in spring-time from a pavilion. There is an abundance of specimens\r\nof ware of the Sung dynasty at hand to be copied; the elements of nature\r\nsupply an inexhaustible fund of materials for new combinations of\r\nsupernatural beauty. Natural objects are modelled to be fashioned in\r\nmoulds and painted in appropriate colours. _The materials of the\r\npotter’s art are derived from forests and streams, and ornamental themes\r\nare supplied by the same natural sources._‘[68] It is a strange fancy\r\nwhich connects the decoration of a vase with the source of the materials\r\nwith which it is made. Elsewhere, speaking of the painting of the blue\r\nand white ware, Tang-ying says: ‘For painting of flowers and of birds,\r\nfishes and water-plants, and living objects generally, the study of\r\nnature is the first requisite. In the imitation of Ming porcelain and of\r\nancient pieces, the sight of many specimens brings skill.’ We see in\r\nthis a kind of hesitation, a balancing between two influences--the\r\nnaturalistic and the traditional--which is characteristic of the period.\r\n\r\nWe may call attention, by the way, to the important place that is given\r\nin this report to the process of moulding in the fashioning of a vase,\r\nespecially as _supplementary_ to the throwing on the wheel, and above\r\nall, to the care required in the turning and polishing on the jigger or\r\nlathe to ensure accuracy of outline in the finished piece.\r\n\r\nThe last picture described by Tang-ying illustrates the worshipping of\r\nthe local god and the offering of sacrifice. And we are told the story\r\nof how, when the great dragon-bowls failed time after time, and when, in\r\nconsequence, the workmen were harassed by the eunuchs sent down by the\r\nMing emperor, Tung the potter leaped into the furnace; and how, after\r\nthis sacrifice, when the kilns were opened, the bowls were at last found\r\nperfect in shape and brilliant in colour. So Tung was worshipped as the\r\npotter’s god; and, indeed, Tang-ying tells us, as a voucher for the\r\ntruth of his story, that in his time one of these very dragon\r\nfish-bowls, ‘compounded of the blood and bones of the deity,’ still\r\nstood in the courtyard of the temple, a witness to the sacrifice\r\n(Bushell, chapter xv).\r\n\r\nTang-ying resigned his post in 1746; his influence was therefore only\r\nfelt during the first years of Kien-lung’s long reign. His is the last\r\nname that can be personally connected with any Chinese ware, unless it\r\nbe that of the emperor his master.\r\n\r\nKien-lung was a poet, and a very productive one--his complete works were\r\npublished in an edition of 360 volumes, containing nearly 34,000\r\nseparate compositions. These are generally occasional pieces suggested\r\nby the aspects of nature. Such verses are not unfrequently found on the\r\negg-shell porcelain of his time, signed, too, with the vermilion pencil.\r\nThere is quite a long poem of his on a dish of thin ware now in the\r\nMusée Guimet in Paris.\r\n\r\nThe emperor interested himself in a new kind of opaque glass made in\r\nPekin by a skilful artist, one Hu, and he sent specimens of this ware to\r\nKing-te-chen to be imitated in the nobler material, as he deemed it.\r\nThis was effected by means of a very vitreous paste, and the little\r\nsnuff-bottles moulded in high relief in this material are much prized\r\nboth by Chinese and American collectors.\r\n\r\nThere was, indeed, at this time a rage for imitating other substances in\r\nporcelain, which was doubtless fostered by the increased command of\r\ntechnical processes and of new colours. A good deal of the porcelain\r\ncovered with black or sometimes brown lacquer,[69] inlaid with\r\nmother-of-pearl, the _laque burgauté_ of the French, dates perhaps from\r\nan earlier period. But the little snuff-bottles, imitating jade,\r\npudding-stone, agate, turquoise, as well as silver, gold, and bronze of\r\nvaried patinas, or again the rusted surface of iron--to say nothing of\r\nwood, bamboo, and mother-of-pearl--may, with few exceptions, be\r\nattributed to this time. We may compare such work to the contemporary\r\ntriumphs of the Japanese in lacquer.[70]\r\n\r\nBut by the middle of the century it is no longer the demand of the court\r\nthat gives the general tone to the productions of King-te-chen. The\r\ntaste for Oriental wares had spread among the middle classes in Europe.\r\nThe English were taking the place of the Dutch as the principal\r\nexporters, and this change was reflected in a demand for a gaudy ware\r\ncrowded with a motley array of figures, the ‘mandarin china’ properly so\r\ncalled. As to the extensive class of porcelain painted with\r\ncoats-of-arms and other European designs, a class well represented in\r\nthe British Museum, we will only mention that the greater part was\r\ndecorated at this time by a special school of artists at Canton, though\r\nsome pieces date from a somewhat earlier period.\r\n\r\nKIA-KING (1795-1820), the son and successor of Kien-lung, was like his\r\nfather a poet, but a man of weak and dissolute character. The high\r\nfinish of the previous reign was, however, maintained, and the pieces\r\nmarked with this emperor’s name are sought after by Chinese collectors.\r\n\r\nTAO-KWANG (1820-1850).--It is surprising that so much really good\r\nporcelain was made at a time so troubled by foreign wars and internal\r\nrebellion. In some of the blue and white ware of this and even the next\r\nreign, we may sometimes see a return to the breadth and boldness of\r\ntreatment characteristic of earlier days. In the coral-red grounds of\r\nthis time, the intractable iron oxide appears to have been more\r\nthoroughly incorporated with the glaze than at any previous period. It\r\nis to this reign that we may assign the ‘Pekin’ or ‘Graviata’ bowls,\r\nwith reserved panels on the outside filled with flowers, landscapes,\r\netc., in many coloured enamels. The ground is often of a pinkish _rouge\r\nd’or_, or in other instances of lemon yellow, blue or pale lavender. The\r\ninside of the bowl has a decoration of blue and white.\r\n\r\nHSIEN-FENG (1850-61).--As at the beginning of this emperors reign the\r\nTaiping rebels broke into Kiang-si and burned down the town of\r\nKing-te-chen, this period is of necessity a blank in the history of\r\nporcelain.\r\n\r\nTUNG-CHI (1861-1874).--In the third year of this reign the rebels were\r\ndriven out from King-te-chen and the imperial works rebuilt. A large\r\norder was at once sent from Pekin for porcelain of every description.\r\nThe details of this order, the latest of the lists of this kind to be\r\nfound in the _Annals of Kiang-si_, are only given in the edition of that\r\nwork published since the date of Julien’s translation. This list is\r\ntranslated by Dr. Bushell, fifty-five headings in all, and we find in it\r\na curious instance of the survival of the old traditions. All the wares\r\nmentioned in the older lists are now again requisitioned for the use of\r\nthe court.\r\n\r\nThe Empress-Dowager, who has held the reins during the minority both of\r\nTung-chi and of his successor, the present emperor, is reputed to be\r\nsomething of a connoisseur,[71] and to take an interest in the imperial\r\nmanufactory. Some of the better class wares from the palace and from the\r\ntemples at Pekin have quite lately found their way to England, and\r\nspecimens may be seen on loan at South Kensington. I notice especially a\r\nset of five vessels in deep blue from the Temple of Heaven. The\r\nexecution appears to be careful, but the forms are ugly and the blue of\r\nan unpleasant tint. In vessels of this kind, however, both shape and\r\ncolour may be governed by tradition. Mr. Hippisley, who has lived long\r\nin China, says that for some years past the _famille verte_ wares of\r\nKang-he’s time, especially the vases with black ground and prunus\r\nflowers, have been fairly well reproduced at King-te-chen, as have,\r\nlater still, the so-called ‘hawthorn ginger-jars.’ But in China, as in\r\nFrance, it is with the difficulties of the copper glazes, the _flambé_\r\nand the _sang de bœuf_, that the majority of our contemporary ceramic\r\nartists are striving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE PORCELAIN OF CHINA--(continued).\r\n\r\n\r\nMARKS\r\n\r\nWe may here conveniently say something of the marks found on Chinese\r\nporcelain. We do not propose to give any systematic account of these\r\nmarks--this is a subject indeed to which a disproportionate amount of\r\nspace has perhaps been devoted in some works on porcelain--but rather to\r\ncollect a few notes on points of interest.\r\n\r\nTang-ying in his report to the emperor on the manufacture of porcelain,\r\nfrom which we have lately quoted, tells us that during all the processes\r\nof turning on the lathe, painting and glazing, a solid bar is left at\r\nthe base of the vase by which it is conveniently handled. This bar or\r\nhandle is at length cut off short, and the base of the stump is scooped\r\nout to form the foot of the future vessel. It is at this stage that the\r\ninscription is written by a special artist on the centre of the base,\r\nand then brushed over with a coat of the glaze, which does not extend\r\nover the rim to join the rest of the glazed surface. Thus we see that\r\nthe writing of the inscription and the glazing of the base are\r\nsubsequent to and independent of the decoration of the rest of the vase.\r\nIn whatever style this decoration may be, the inscription is generally\r\nwritten in cobalt blue under the glaze.\r\n\r\nThere are many varieties of Chinese writing. We pass from the oldest\r\n‘tadpole’ forms, by way of the _chuan_ or seal character, to the\r\n_kai-shû_, which takes the place roughly of our ordinary printed\r\nletters. Of this last, the square detached strokes pass when written\r\nwith a brush into the more flowing ‘grass’ character. The _kai-shû_\r\nstyle is the one most frequently found on porcelain, or at least a form\r\nsomething between it and the grass hand. The seal character, however,\r\nwas much favoured by the Manchu emperors, and since the time of Kang-he\r\nhas been practically the only one used for the imperial _nien-hao_ (PL.\r\nA. 10-12).[72]\r\n\r\nThe Chinese have two methods of indicating a date: first, by a cycle of\r\nsixty years; second, by the name given to the whole or part of the reign\r\nof an emperor. With the first we are not concerned, it is found so\r\nrarely on porcelain.[73] The other, the imperial date or _nien-hao_, has\r\nbeen in use ever since the time of the Han dynasty (say roughly from the\r\nbeginning of our era). Very early dates of this kind are often found on\r\nbronzes, where, however, they are no more to be relied on than in the\r\ncase of porcelain. The inscription occurs in two forms:--first, the six\r\nword form where the emperor’s name is preceded by that of the dynasty,\r\nthus: _Ta Tsing Kang-he nien chi_,--‘Made in the reign of the Emperor\r\nKang-he of the great Tsing or Manchu dynasty’ (PL. A. 8); or second, the\r\nfirst line with the name of the dynasty may be omitted, leaving only the\r\nemperor’s name and the words _nien chi_, ‘year made,‘--for example,\r\n_Cheng-hua nien chi_ (PL. A. 3).\r\n\r\nThe name by which we know the emperor of China was not his personal or\r\nfamily name, but was assumed on ascending the throne, and in old times\r\nwas frequently changed. But from the time of the Sung dynasty such a\r\nchange has only once occurred. This was in the case of the unfortunate\r\nMing emperor Cheng-tung, to whom we referred on p. 93. We rarely find\r\nthe name of any emperor of an earlier time than the Ming dynasty on\r\nporcelain, and the few instances that do occur are obvious forgeries.\r\nPerhaps the earliest date on Chinese porcelain with any claim to\r\nauthority is the _nien-hao_ of Yung-lo (1402-25), in quaint ‘tadpole’\r\ncharacters engraved in the paste beneath the glaze. This inscription\r\noccurs on the thin bowl of Ting ware in the British Museum, described on\r\npage 67 (PL. A. 1).\r\n\r\nWe have said before, and we cannot too strongly impress this fact upon\r\nthe reader, that the vast majority of the Ming marks so frequently found\r\non Chinese porcelain are of no value. They teach us nothing themselves,\r\nand when we can accept them it is on evidence derived from other\r\nsources. As Franks observed many years ago, all we can say is that a\r\npiece of porcelain is not older than the date which it bears.\r\n\r\nWhen we find the date inscribed in a horizontal line round the neck of a\r\nvase, as is not infrequent in later Ming times, especially in the reign\r\nof Wan-li[74] (1572-1619), more reliance may perhaps be put on it, as\r\nregards ware of Chinese origin at least, for the Japanese were very fond\r\nof decorating their blue and white ware with Ming inscriptions placed in\r\nthis position.\r\n\r\nWe have innumerable vases in our collections undoubtedly made in the\r\nreign of the great Kang-he (1661-1722),[75] but his reign-mark is\r\ncomparatively rarely found. The absence of this _nien-hao_ is usually\r\nexplained by a proclamation, issued in 1677, which has been preserved in\r\nthe Chinese books, forbidding the inscription of the imperial name on\r\nporcelain. With this proclamation the empty double ring of blue often\r\nfound on the base of vases of this time may perhaps be connected. Many\r\nof the finest pieces, however, bear no mark of any kind.\r\n\r\nIn place of these date-marks we may often find an inscription stating\r\nthat the piece was made at a certain _Tang_--for example, _Shun ti tang\r\nchi_--literally ‘Cultivation virtue hall made’ (PL. B. 17). We have here\r\ntranslated the character _tang_ by the somewhat vague word ‘hall,’ but\r\nit is doubtful whether the inscription should be rendered ‘made for the\r\nShun-ti pavilion,’ _i.e._ for the imperial palace, or rather, ‘made at\r\nthe Shun-ti hall,‘--that is to say, at the studio or factory of that\r\nname, presumably at King-te-chen. The best authorities, however, are in\r\nfavour of the latter rendering (Bushell, p. 78 _seq._, and the Franks\r\n_Catalogue_, p. 213), and they regard these so-called hall-marks as more\r\nor less equivalent to the signature of the manufacturer. The character\r\n_tang_ is sometimes replaced by other words, as _tsuan_, a balcony;\r\n_ting_, a summer-house; or _chai_, a studio. This last word is the\r\nJapanese _sai_, which so often forms a part of the adopted names of\r\nJapanese artists, as for example Hoku-sai, which means the ‘northern\r\nstudio.’ The Japanese potter often signs his work, and even in China we\r\nfind in a few cases a name, that of the painter, inscribed in the field\r\nof the decoration,--we have already mentioned some instances of\r\nsignatures found in this position (p. 108).\r\n\r\nOf another kind is the inscription found on certain egg-shell cups of\r\nthe time of Wan-li (1572-1619). These cups, of which we have no\r\nspecimens unfortunately in our collections, were made by a famous\r\npoet-potter who signs himself _Hu yin tao jen_, or ‘the Taoist hidden in\r\na pot.’ The reference is to a Taoist recluse (what the Japanese know as\r\na _Sennin_) who when disinclined for society was in the habit of\r\nretiring into his gourd-bottle. At the same time, as Dr. Hirth has\r\npointed out, the words form an excellent motto for an artist--the true\r\nexpression of whose genius we seek in his works.\r\n\r\nThere is a third class of marks which celebrate the beauty of the vessel\r\non which they are inscribed or, more rarely, refer to the subject of the\r\ndecoration. A large number of these are illustrated in Franks’s\r\n_Catalogue of Oriental Porcelain_. We will merely quote as examples ‘A\r\ngem among precious jewels of rare jade’ (PL. B. 16), and, with reference\r\nto the decoration, which in this case includes some red fishes,\r\n‘Enjoying themselves in the waters’ (PL. B. 44). Such rather tame\r\nsentences do not teach us much. More suggestive is the inscription we\r\nfind on a cylindrical vase for holding writing materials: ‘Scholarship\r\nlofty as the hills and the Great Bear’ (PL. B. 15)--a fit motto for the\r\ndesk of the student.\r\n\r\nThe Emblems or Devices that so frequently occur in lieu of inscriptions\r\non Chinese porcelain are well illustrated in the British Museum\r\ncatalogue. They are, however, of little or no value in classifying or\r\ndating the pieces on which they are found--they can seldom be connected\r\nwith any known manufacturer or artist. Such devices are generally\r\nsymbolic, above all of long life, riches, and honours, the three things\r\ndesired by a Chinaman, and I suppose that they are more or less vaguely\r\nexpected to bring to the owner the good luck that they suggest.\r\n\r\nSome of these devices remind us of the ‘canting’ charges and badges of\r\nour heraldry. Thus a bat (PL. B. 19 A.) is in Chinese called _fu_, but\r\nthe same word also means happiness; so again a peach is _shu_, but _shu_\r\nmeans also long life. The characters for happiness (PL. B. 23) and long\r\nlife (PL. B. 19), we may mention, are of constant appearance, the first\r\nusually as a mark on the base, the second as an integral part of the\r\ndecoration, on both Chinese and Japanese porcelain. Such interest, then,\r\nas can be found in these marks is derived rather from the light they\r\nthrow upon the working of the Chinese mind than from any information\r\nthey give us about the porcelain on which they are inscribed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE PORCELAIN OF CHINA--(_continued_).\r\n\r\n\r\nKING-TE-CHEN AND THE PÈRE D’ENTRECOLLES\r\n\r\nThere is nothing more remarkable in the history of the porcelain of\r\nChina, than the fact of the concentration in one spot, for so many\r\ncenturies, of an industry for the supply of almost the entire\r\npopulation. So that as regards porcelain, as China stands to the rest of\r\nthe world, so the town of King-te-chen stands to the rest of China. In\r\nfact, to parody a French saying,--‘_Qui dit porcelaine dit la Chine, qui\r\ndit la Chine dit King-te-chen_.’\r\n\r\nLet us then consider the position of this town, above all in relation to\r\nthe three principal outlets of its trade--I mean the supply of the court\r\nat Pekin, the export at Canton, and the general demand of the country.\r\nIf the reader will consult a good map of China, one that shows the\r\nrivers, for these are the real trunk-lines of the commerce of the\r\ncountry, he will soon understand in what a commanding position\r\nKing-te-chen is placed. It is true that the distance from Pekin is not\r\nfar short of a thousand miles, following the winding course of the Grand\r\nCanal, the Yang-tse river, and the waters of the Po-yang lake; but by\r\nthis route there is water communication without a break for the whole\r\nway.[76] So again the whole journey to Canton may be made by boat, with\r\nthe exception of a short portage over the watershed on the borders of\r\nthe provinces of Kiang-si and Kuang-tung. This was the route taken by\r\nLord Amherst in 1816-17, when returning overland from Pekin to Canton.\r\nThe journey is well described by Sir John Davis in his _Sketches of\r\nChina_. As they approached the Po-yang lake, the porcelain shops and\r\ndepôts in the towns became more and more prominent. These were supplied\r\nfrom the emporium at Jao-chau Fu, the great city near the spot where the\r\nriver descending from King-te-chen falls into the Po-yang lake. Davis\r\ndescribes the beautiful scenery and the classical associations of the\r\nmountainous country surrounding the lake. Proceeding southward they\r\nascended the Kia-kiang river, passing by Nan-chang Fu, a great centre\r\nfor the commerce of southern China. The river is very shallow in its\r\nupper course, but along it passes a constant stream of traffic, by means\r\nof a narrow passage scooped out in the shingly bed. The Meiling Pass is\r\ncrossed by a paved road, partly excavated in the rock and in places cut\r\ninto steps--a road made some twelve centuries ago by an emperor of the\r\nTang dynasty. After a journey of some thirty miles on horseback another\r\nstream was reached, down which they floated to the great Western River\r\nand the waters of Canton. It is by this route that nine-tenths of the\r\nChinese porcelain that has reached Europe must have passed. How this\r\nporcelain is packed at King-te-chen and forwarded to Canton and to other\r\nparts of China is well shown in a series of native drawings exhibited by\r\nthe side of the cases containing the porcelain in the British Museum.\r\n\r\nKing-te-chen stands on a small river that flows south-west to fall into\r\nthe Po-yang lake. At this point, close by the lake, lies, as already\r\nmentioned, the city of Jao-chau, the capital of the whole district and\r\nthe residence of the prefect. King-te-chen, however, the town of the\r\npotter, is not directly subordinate to Jao-chau; to the official mind it\r\nis a mere dependency of the sub-prefecture of Fouliang, a small walled\r\ntown or _hsien_ in the immediate neighbourhood. It is in the annals of\r\nthis _hsien_ that the early history of King-te-chen is to be found. We\r\nmay compare the relative positions of these three Chinese towns with\r\nthose existing in the eighteenth century between the long straggling\r\nvillages of Burslem or Stoke and the adjacent town of Newcastle in the\r\nfirst place, and then between the latter and the county town of\r\nStafford. The importance of King-te-chen may, however, be inferred from\r\nthe fact that the superintendent of the imperial potteries was often at\r\nthe same time controller of the local customs and viceroy of the\r\nsurrounding provinces.\r\n\r\nKing-te-chen, then, was built where the little river flowed out from the\r\nbarren mountain tract to the east--a region made still more barren by\r\nthe cutting down of all the wood to provide fuel for the kilns, and\r\nwhose inhabitants were reputed to be as rude and rugged as their\r\nsurroundings. It is from the gorges of this rough hilly country that the\r\nprecious kaolin and petuntse are excavated. These substances are formed\r\nlocally by the decomposition of the rock of which the hills are\r\ncomposed, a variety of graphic granite with much soda-holding felspar.\r\n\r\nIn a narrow space, crowded for more than four miles along the river bank\r\nbetween shops, temples, and guardhouses, were built the kilns and the\r\nworkshops. Towards the south rises a small hill where the tiled roofs of\r\nthe temples and pavilions are seen half hidden among the trees. This is\r\nthe Jewel or Guardian Hill which commands the adjacent imperial\r\nmanufactory. This factory was first established here in the fourteenth\r\ncentury, but since then it has been more than once burned to the ground\r\nin times of riot and rebellion. The works were last rebuilt in 1866.\r\n\r\nDr. Bushell has translated an official description of the series of\r\nworkshops, from the mixing-house to the muffle-furnaces of the\r\nenamellers, the whole enclosed by a wall about a mile in circuit. The\r\nkilns are no longer within the enclosure as they were in Ming times. The\r\nimperial porcelain is now fired in private furnaces scattered through\r\nthe town.\r\n\r\nThe French Jesuit missionary to whom, above any one else, is due the\r\ncredit of first describing to the people of the West the nature of\r\nporcelain and how it was made, was living, at the time when the earliest\r\nof his famous letters was written (in 1712), at Jao-chau, the capital of\r\nthe district. The letter is addressed to the _procureur_ of the order in\r\nParis, and it would seem that it was before long made public.[77] It was\r\nfollowed in 1722 by a second supplementary letter, dated this time from\r\nKing-te-chen itself. The Père D’Entrecolles had already been many years\r\nin China, and had before this sent home important letters on other\r\nbranches of Chinese industry. The first letter on porcelain gives proof\r\nof long acquaintance with the subject, and it is not impossible that he\r\nmay already have corresponded with some one in Europe on the same\r\nsubject. I make this suggestion in connection with the curious\r\ncoincidence of date between the residence of D’Entrecolles in this\r\ndistrict and the first manufacture of porcelain in Saxony.\r\n\r\nThese letters were naturally read with avidity at this time in Paris and\r\nelsewhere. The seed fell on fertile ground, and but one thing was\r\nwanting, and that was--some actual specimens of the materials described\r\nby the Jesuit father. The indications on this head, given in the\r\nletters, were indeed quite insufficient, and would rather tend to put\r\ninquirers on a false scent. The writer, for example, had no notion of\r\nthe real nature of kaolin, a substance which in one place he compares\r\nto chalk. On the other hand, the technical details so fully given were\r\nat that time new. Since then this information has filtered down through\r\nmany books, so that much of it now appears quite trite.\r\n\r\nI will confine myself to a few extracts bearing on points of interest\r\nthat I may have overlooked elsewhere. These letters are written in the\r\nclear, flowing language of the time, and they are delightful reading.\r\nAfter giving some account from the _Annals of Fouliang_ of the early\r\nhistory of porcelain, and describing how the industry was gradually\r\nconcentrated at King-te-chen, the Père D’Entrecolles goes on to say:\r\n‘Apart from the pottery that is made all over China, there are a few\r\nother provinces, as those of Fukien and Canton, where porcelain is\r\nmade.’ By Canton, in this case, we must understand, I suppose, the\r\nprovince of Kuang-tung, and this is a piece of information of some\r\ninterest. The attempts made to establish workmen from King-te-chen at\r\nPekin, and again in the neighbourhood of Amoy, from which port so large\r\na commerce was already carried on with Europe, had, he says, wholly\r\nfailed.\r\n\r\nThere then follows a description of King-te-chen, with its long streets\r\nand its population of more than a million, ‘as is commonly reported.’ He\r\ntells us of a rich Chinese merchant who, after making his fortune in the\r\nIndies, had built a magnificent temple to the Queen of Heaven (Kwan-yin,\r\nprobably). The European piastres he had brought back were well known in\r\nthe district, although this was not the case in other parts of China. We\r\nhave a picture of the busy quay and of the three ranges of junks closely\r\npacked along the side, and for a background the whirlwinds of flame\r\nrising from the three thousand kilns of the city.[78] After praising\r\nthe admirable police arrangements, he comes to his main subject, the\r\nmanufacture of porcelain.\r\n\r\nThe small vessels that bring down the kaolin and the petuntse (in the\r\nlatter he notes the scattered shiny particles--the mica) from a distance\r\nof twenty or thirty leagues are even more numerous than the big junks\r\nthat take the finished ware down to Jao-chau. The details of manufacture\r\nthat follow--and to quote them would be only to go once more over the\r\nground covered in a previous chapter--were learned by the Père\r\nD’Entrecolles not only from the Christian workmen, but by frequent\r\nvisits to the works themselves. ‘These great laboratories,’ he tells us,\r\n‘have been for me a kind of Areopagus where I have preached’ (I quote\r\nthe rest in French) ‘_celui qui a formé le premier homme de limon et des\r\nmains duquel nous sortons pour devenir des vases de gloire ou\r\nd’ignominie_.’\r\n\r\nIn describing the preparation of the paste much stress is laid upon the\r\ncare taken to exclude all extraneous matter, especially that which may\r\nhave been introduced into the kaolin or petuntse by way of adulteration.\r\nThe slip for the glaze--for the latter the Chinese term ‘oil’ is\r\nretained--is said to be brought down from the mountains, where it is\r\nprepared, in a liquid form. The division of labour in the manufacture is\r\ncarried so far that a piece of porcelain before completion may pass\r\nthrough the hands of as many as seventy workmen, to each of whom a\r\nseparate task is assigned.\r\n\r\nThe important part played by moulding, both as a direct process and\r\nsubsidiary to throwing on the wheel, is well brought out in this\r\ndescription. I will give a rendering of the passage in which the process\r\nof moulding is described, as in an English translation in a recent work\r\nthere is some apparent confusion. ‘When the piece to be copied is of\r\nsuch a nature that it cannot be imitated with the potter’s hands on the\r\nwheel, a special kind of clay used only for moulds is impressed upon it\r\n[_i.e._ upon the model]. In this way a mould is made of several pieces,\r\neach of a considerable size. These pieces are now dried, and when they\r\nare required for use they are held near the fire for some time, after\r\nwhich they are filled with the paste to the thickness desirable in the\r\nporcelain. The paste is pressed in with the hands and the mould is again\r\nplaced near the fire. The impressed figure becomes at once detached from\r\nthe mould by the heat that consumes the moisture that has made it\r\nadhere. The different parts of a piece separately moulded are now joined\r\ntogether with a somewhat liquid slip, made of the same material as the\r\nporcelain.’ Great numbers of these moulds are kept in stock, so that an\r\norder from Europe can be quickly executed.\r\n\r\nThe porcelain painters, he tells us, are just as ‘poor beggars’\r\n(_gueux_) as the other workmen; and he has evidently a very mean opinion\r\nof the art of painting as practised at that time in China: ‘_Ils\r\nignorent les belles règles de cet Art_.’ But such an estimate of\r\nOriental art was universal at that time, when everything was measured\r\nfrom the standpoint of Versailles and the _roi soleil_. ‘The work of the\r\npainter is divided in the same laboratory among a great number of\r\nworkmen. It is the sole business of one to trace the coloured circle\r\nthat we see near the edge of the vessel; another draws the outline of\r\nthe flowers, which a third fills in. One painter does the mountains and\r\nthe water, another the birds and the animals. It is the human figure\r\nthat is the most badly handled.... As for the colours on the porcelain,\r\nwe find all sorts. Little is seen in Europe except that with bright blue\r\non a white ground. I think, however, that our merchants have brought\r\nover other kinds.’ (The implication is, no doubt, ‘since I have left\r\nFrance.’ This helps us to fix the date of the introduction of coloured\r\nporcelain into Europe.) ‘Some we find with a ground like that of our\r\nburning mirrors.’ (This is doubtless the _Wu-chin_, or metallic black of\r\nthe Chinese. This ‘mirror-black’ is compared to a concave glass\r\nblackened behind.) ‘Other kinds are wholly red, and among them some are\r\n_d’un rouge à l’huile_ (_yu-li-hung_), and some of a _rouge soufflé_\r\n(_chui-hung_), and covered with little points almost like a miniature.\r\nWhen these two varieties are executed with perfect success--and to do\r\nthis is difficult enough--they are highly esteemed and are very dear.’\r\nThe _yu-li-hung_, literally ‘red inside the glaze,’ may be taken to\r\ninclude the various shades of red derived from copper, of the _grand\r\nfeu_. The _rouge soufflé_ is explained below. The word ‘miniature’ is\r\nused, I think, in the old sense of an illuminated manuscript. ‘Finally\r\nthere are kinds of porcelain with the landscapes on them painted with a\r\nmixture of nearly every colour, heightened by a brilliant gilding. These\r\nare very beautiful, if no expense is spared. Otherwise the ordinary\r\nporcelain of this kind is not to be compared with that which is painted\r\nwith azure alone. The _Annals of King-te-chen_ say that formerly the\r\npeople used nothing but a white ware.’\r\n\r\nThe source of the cobalt blue is now discussed and its mode of\r\npreparation. The raw material is thrown into the bed of the furnace and\r\nthere roasted for twenty-four hours. It is then reduced to an impalpable\r\npowder in a mortar of biscuit porcelain. The red is made by roasting\r\ncopperas to a high temperature in a crucible. The white that is used as\r\nan enamel in decorating porcelain is prepared from ‘_un caillou\r\ntransparent_,’ which is also roasted on the floor of the furnace.[79]\r\nThis _caillou_ is mixed with two parts of white lead, and this mixture\r\nforms a flux--the basis for the colours. There then follows some account\r\nof the other colours used, but here it is difficult to follow the good\r\nfather. He makes some strange statements, which are not all of them\r\ncleared up in his supplementary letter of 1722. There are indeed so many\r\namplifications and corrections in the latter that it will be well to\r\ncombine in our summary the gleanings from the two sources. This second\r\nletter is dated from King-te-chen after an interval of ten years, and\r\nshows a greater acquaintance with practical details.\r\n\r\nPassing over the account of the _flambé_ and of some other glazes--to\r\navoid repetition we will defer our remarks till we come to speak of\r\nthese wares in the next chapter--we hear in the second letter of a\r\nvaluable material lately discovered which may take the place of kaolin\r\nin the composition of the paste. This is described as a chalky-looking\r\nbody which is largely used by Chinese doctors as a medicine and is\r\ncalled _Hua-shi_.\r\n\r\nWe will here interrupt the Père D’Entrecolles’s account to mention that\r\nthe _hua-shi_ is strictly speaking soapstone or steatite, a silicate of\r\nmagnesia. But whether magnesia ever enters into the paste or glaze of\r\nChinese porcelain is as yet a disputed question.[80] As far as I know,\r\nit has never been found by analysis. The Chinese nomenclature of rocks\r\nis necessarily based on their physical aspect alone. Some specimens sent\r\nfrom King-te-chen, which were described on the labels as _hua-shi_, were\r\nfound at Sèvres to consist of an impure kaolin containing a large\r\nquantity of mica.\r\n\r\nTo return to the father’s letters:--In China this _hua-shi_ is five\r\ntimes as dear as kaolin. Four parts of it are mixed with one part of\r\npetuntse to make the paste. The porcelain made with this material is\r\nrare, and much more expensive than any other. Compared to ordinary\r\nporcelain, it is as vellum compared with paper; it is, besides, of a\r\nlightness that is quite surprising. It is, however, very fragile, and\r\nthere are great difficulties connected with the firing. For this reason\r\nit is sometimes only applied as a coating to the surface of ordinary\r\npaste. The _hua-shi_ is also used to form an ivory-white slip, with\r\nwhich designs are delicately painted on the surface of the vessel. (We\r\nmay probably identify this _hua-shi_ ware with the _sha t’ai_ or ‘soft\r\npaste,’ so called, of Western collectors.)\r\n\r\nWhat we are told by the Jesuit father about the revival of the\r\nmanufacture of celadon is of great interest. ‘I was shown this year,’ he\r\nsays, ‘for the first time, a new kind of porcelain which is now in\r\nfashion. It is of a colour approaching olive, and is called\r\n_Lung-chuan_.’ The colour of the glaze is given by the same yellow earth\r\nthat is used for the _or bruni_ glaze, and it is often highly crackled.\r\nWith this statement we may compare the account which he gives in another\r\npart of his second letter of the revival of the manufacture of archaic\r\nwares. ‘The Mandarin of King-te-chen, who honoured me with his\r\nfriendship, made presents to his protectors at the court of pieces of\r\nold porcelain [_sic_] which he has the talent to make himself. I mean\r\nthat he has found the art of imitating the ancient ware, or at least\r\nthat of a considerable age, and he employs a number of workmen with this\r\nobject. The material of these false antiques (Chinese _Ku-tung_) is a\r\nyellowish earth brought from the Ma-an mountains. They are very thick--a\r\nplate which the Mandarin gave me was ten times the usual weight. The\r\npeculiarity of this ware is the glaze made from a yellowish rock, which\r\nbecomes sea-green on firing.’ This change of colour, of course, was the\r\nresult of a reducing flame, but note the keen observation of the\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PLATE XIV._ JAPANESE, IMARI WARE, BLUE AND WHITE WITH\r\nGOLD]\r\n\r\nnarrator. ‘When completed the pieces are boiled in a very greasy soup,\r\nand then left for a month or more in the most foul drain that can be\r\nfound. After this process they may claim to be three or four hundred\r\nyears old, and to date from the dynasty preceding the Ming. They\r\nresemble the real antiques in not giving a ringing note when struck....\r\nThey have brought me from the _débris_ of a large shop a little plate\r\nwhich I value more than the finest porcelain made a thousand years ago.\r\nOn it is painted a crucifix between the Holy Virgin and St. John. Such\r\npieces were made formerly for Japan, but they have not been in demand\r\nfor the last sixteen or seventeen years.’ These plates, he thinks, were\r\nsmuggled into that country mixed with other goods, for the use of the\r\nnative Christians. (_Cf._ the Japanese dish, PL. XIV.)\r\n\r\nThe account given by the Père D’Entrecolles of the firing of porcelain\r\nis so detailed and accurate that it forms an interesting commentary on\r\nwhat we have said in a former chapter on this subject.[81] We have first\r\na description of the man who carries the unbaked ware to the furnace,\r\nranged on two long narrow planks. Balancing these on his shoulders, he\r\nthreads his way through the narrow streets, for the furnaces, as we have\r\nseen, may often be a long way from the factory. He goes on to say, ‘the\r\nplace where the furnaces are presents another scene. In a kind of\r\nvestibule in front of the kilns are seen heaps of clay boxes destined to\r\ncontain the porcelain.’ These, of course, are the ‘seggars’ already\r\ndescribed. Each piece of porcelain of any size has its own case. The\r\nsmaller pieces are packed many together in one seggar. On the bottom of\r\neach of these cases is a layer of sand covered with a little powdered\r\nkaolin. Each seggar forms the cover to the one below it, and so the\r\nwhole furnace is filled with these great piles of cases each packed\r\nwith porcelain. ‘By favour of this thick veil the beauty, and if I may\r\nso express myself, the complexion of the porcelain is not tanned by the\r\nardour of the fire.’ The workman, without touching the fragile raw\r\npieces, rapidly transfers them to the furnace by means of a flexible\r\nwooden fork. There are six inches of coarse gravel in the bottom of the\r\nfurnace, and on this rest the piles of seggars. The middle range is at\r\nleast seven feet high, the two lowest seggars in each pile being left\r\nempty, as is also the one on the top. The middle of the furnace is\r\nreserved for the finest porcelain, while near the front are the pieces\r\nmade with a more fusible paste. The piles of seggars are strengthened by\r\nbeing battened together with clay, but it is the first duty of the\r\nfireman to see that there is a free passage of air. The seggars are made\r\nin a large village a league from King-te-chen, with a mixture of three\r\nkinds of clay.\r\n\r\nThe furnaces, he tells us, which are now of larger dimensions than\r\nformerly, are built over a capacious arched vault, and the hearth or\r\nfireplace extends across the whole width of the front of the furnace. It\r\nwould seem that the process of firing is carried on more rapidly than in\r\nformer days, and to economise fuel and time the smaller pieces at any\r\nrate are taken out a few hours after the extinction of the fire.\r\nSometimes on opening the furnace the whole contents, both seggars and\r\nporcelain, are found to be reduced to a half-melted mass as hard as a\r\nrock. A change in the weather may alter in a moment the action of the\r\nfire, so that a hundred workmen are ruined to one who succeeds and is\r\nable to set up a crockery shop.\r\n\r\nThe ware made in European style finds no favour with the Chinese, and if\r\nnot accepted by the export merchants remains on the maker’s hands.\r\n\r\nWe are told of the marvellous _tours de force_ executed in porcelain,\r\nsome years ago, for the heir-apparent, especially of certain open-work\r\nlanterns[82] and strange musical instruments. We see from this at how\r\nearly a date the future emperor (Yung-cheng) showed an interest in\r\nporcelain. The Chinese, it is said, succeed above all in grotesques and\r\nin figures of animals; the workmen make ducks and tortoises that float\r\non the water. They make, too, many statues of Kwan-yin,--she is\r\nrepresented holding a child in her arms, and in this form is invoked by\r\nsterile women who wish for children.\r\n\r\nThe mandarins, he continues, who appreciate the talents of Europeans for\r\ningenious novelties, have sometimes asked me to procure for them from\r\nEurope new and curious designs, so that they may have something singular\r\nto present to the emperor.[83] On the other hand, the Christian workmen\r\nstrongly urged me to do no such thing. For the mandarins do not yield so\r\neasily as our merchants when told that a proposed work is impracticable.\r\nMany are the _bastinados_ given to the men before the official will\r\nabandon the design from which he hoped so much profit.\r\n\r\n‘What becomes of the vast accumulation of potsherds, both from the\r\nseggars and from the firings?’ the writer finally asks. Mixed with lime,\r\nthey are largely used to form a cement with which the walls of gardens\r\nand roads are constructed. They also help to build up the new ground\r\nwhich is reclaimed from the banks of the river. Carried down thence by\r\nthe floods, they form a glittering pavement for many miles below the\r\ntown.\r\n\r\nIn the detailed account of King-te-chen given by the Jesuit father, we\r\nfind no mention of the imperial manufactory. Are we to understand that\r\nhe found no admittance to these workshops? His acquaintance with the\r\nhigher mandarins makes this unlikely. Nor can we think that these works\r\nwere closed during the long period of his stay in this district. Another\r\nomission that has been pointed out is, I think, more easy of\r\nexplanation. The Père D’Entrecolles, while giving in great detail the\r\nmethod of preparation of the various colours used in the enamels and\r\nglazes, does not say a word about the famous crimson derived from gold,\r\nso largely used in the _famille rose_ decoration. I cannot but think\r\nthat this omission is an almost conclusive proof that the _rouge d’or_\r\nwas not known at that time.[84] The ignorance of the Chinese of chemical\r\nprocesses is dwelt upon, and it is especially mentioned that they are\r\nacquainted with neither _aqua fortis_ nor _aqua regia_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTHE PORCELAIN OF CHINA--(_continued_).\r\n\r\n\r\nForms and Uses--Description of the various Wares.\r\n\r\nWe have now given a summary sketch of the history and development of the\r\nporcelain of China, and have seen something of the processes of\r\nmanufacture and decoration. Incidentally some account has been given of\r\nthe principal wares.\r\n\r\nWe now propose to take up the subject from the side of the paste, the\r\nglaze, and the decoration, putting aside the question of age and of\r\nhistorical sequence, and to run through the various classes into which\r\nwe can divide our material under these heads. We shall follow as far as\r\npossible the arrangement adopted in the British Museum, passing from the\r\nsimpler forms of decoration to the more complex.\r\n\r\nFirst, however, let us say a few words on the forms given to porcelain\r\nby the Chinese, and the uses these objects are put to in the country of\r\ntheir origin.[85]\r\n\r\nIn a first glance at any large collection of Chinese porcelain the bulk\r\nof the objects shown appear to fall into four classes: plates and\r\ndishes, bowls, vases for flowers, and covered jars.[86] But a closer\r\nexamination discloses an endless variety of other uses to which\r\nporcelain has been applied by the Chinese.\r\n\r\nThe figures of the gods and the vessels associated with their worship\r\nfound in the temples and household shrines form by themselves a large\r\ndivision. Here the use of porcelain has from a very early period been\r\nencouraged at the expense of bronze and other metals. The ritual vessels\r\nused in the imperial worship at Pekin have for ages been made of\r\nporcelain. Many of them, as the jars for sacrificial wine, in the form\r\nof elephants and rhinoceroses, are copied from the most archaic bronze\r\ntypes; of the same origin is the small libation cup of peculiar shape\r\nsometimes seen in our collections. The _Wu-kung_, or five vessels that\r\nstand in front of a Buddhist shrine, the incense-burner in the centre,\r\nwith a candlestick and a vase on either side, are often in China made of\r\nporcelain. In Japan these objects are always of metal. A similar set is\r\nfound in the Taoist temples. The colour of the vessels in ritual use at\r\nPekin varies with the temple in which they are found. Those of the\r\nancestral temple of the emperors are of imperial yellow; those of the\r\naltar of heaven of a deep blue (a set of five of this colour, recently\r\nbrought from Pekin, may be seen at South Kensington). A red glazed ware\r\nis connected with the altar of the sun, and white with that of the\r\nplanet Jupiter.\r\n\r\nThe objects used in the burning of perfume, the basis doubtless of the\r\nhighly elaborated apparatus of the Japanese, are usually made of\r\nporcelain: these are the incense-burner, the boxes for the perfumes, and\r\nthe little vase to hold the fire-sticks and the tongs. From these we may\r\npass to the various objects found on the table of the cultured classes,\r\nmost of them connected with literary pursuits. This is an important\r\ndivision in Chinese collections, as we may judge from the often-quoted\r\nmanuscript catalogue of Dr. Bushell. The slabs, the water-drippers, and\r\na dozen other small objects are modelled in a variety of forms. The\r\npen-rest is generally in the shape of a small range of mountains, the\r\nhighest in the centre (this, by the way, is the ancient form of the\r\nChinese character for ‘mountain,’ _cf._ PL. VIII.). One of the strangest\r\nuses to which porcelain is put by the Chinese is the hat-stand in the\r\nform of a hollow sphere supported on a tall, tubular column--the sphere\r\nmay be filled with either fine charcoal embers or with ice, according to\r\nthe season.\r\n\r\nPillows, too, are made of porcelain--there is one of the _famille verte_\r\nin the Salting collection--but the native collector is warned against\r\nthose of a certain size and shape, as they may have been stolen from\r\ntombs. Tall vases to contain arrows, either cylindrical or square in\r\nsection, are especially connected with the Manchus. These large vessels\r\nmay generally be known by their porcelain stands often surrounded by\r\nrailings.\r\n\r\nThe vases and bowls are of all sizes and shapes. The biggest ovoid vases\r\nwith dome-shaped covers may stand in the hall on carved stands; indeed,\r\nthey are found in similar positions in many of the palaces of India,\r\nPersia, and Europe.\r\n\r\nThe flower vases form an important group, and as in Japan, there is\r\nquite a library of illustrated work devoted to them. Both the shape and\r\nthe decoration of the vase are dependent upon the flowers it is destined\r\nto hold, and the arrangement and combination of these flowers is\r\nregulated by rival schools of specialists.\r\n\r\nThe combination of five pieces to form a _garniture de cheminée_ is not\r\naltogether a European idea. The Chinese have a similar combination--the\r\n_Wu-shê_, or set of five; but with them an uncovered vase is preferred\r\nfor the central piece. For the service of the dinner-table there are\r\nmany forms: among the cups, plates, and dishes of all shapes and sizes\r\nwe may select for mention the dishes with covers indicating by their\r\nshapes the contents--fish, birds, or fruit. With these we may compare\r\nthe similar forms made at one time at Chelsea and elsewhere. There are,\r\nagain, the compound dishes in the form of flowers, each petal forming a\r\ncompartment. Finally, we must not forget the tall, cylindrical mugs with\r\ncrown-like tops, used for cooling drinks in summer, or among the Mongols\r\nfor their koumis.\r\n\r\nThere are also certain forms made chiefly, but not exclusively, for the\r\nMohammedan west. Of these, we may mention the bases for the hookah,\r\nrecognisable by the small, straight spouts at the side to which the\r\nflexible smoking-tube is attached; the scent-sprinklers with tall,\r\nnarrow necks; and the hand-spittoons with globular body and\r\nwide-spreading orifice,--these last, by the way, are used in China also.\r\n\r\nIt is not known to what date we can refer the oldest of the little\r\nmedicine-flasks (Chinese _yao-ping_) which have in later times been used\r\nas snuff-bottles. They seem to have been carried westward in large\r\nnumbers by the Arab traders, and that from an early date. In shape and\r\nsize they have varied little.[87] Those found so abundantly in Egypt are\r\ngenerally very small, and are often shaped in imitation of a flattened\r\nvase with a square foot: some of them are of a rough-looking celadon,\r\nothers are covered with a green enamel with white reserves. These are\r\nthe little bottles that found themselves suddenly so famous towards the\r\nbeginning of the last century, when they were extracted by the Arabs\r\nfrom Egyptian tombs of early dynasties. Somewhat later they encountered\r\nsome rivals in the small seals of white Chinese porcelain which were\r\ndiscovered in the Irish bogs!\r\n\r\nWe can only mention in passing a few of the innumerable subsidiary uses\r\nwhich porcelain is made to serve in China, taking the place of so many\r\nother materials, above all of metal:--fittings for furniture, especially\r\nfor the bedstead, frames for the abacus, or calculating-table, knobs for\r\nwalking-sticks and hanging scrolls, boxes of various shapes and sizes\r\nfor cosmetics, buttons, bracelets, and hair-ornaments. Finally, the very\r\nfragments, what we should call pot-sherds, of the oldest wares,\r\nespecially when fine in colour, may be found mounted in gold or silver\r\nand worn as personal ornaments.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe started our sketch of Chinese porcelain with a rough historical\r\ndivision into three classes. We are now concerned only with questions of\r\nglazes and decoration, and we shall find that the apparently innumerable\r\nvarieties of Chinese porcelain fall, with few exceptions, under one or\r\nother of the following heads:--\r\n\r\n1. White, or nearly white, ware, which may be glazed or unglazed.\r\n\r\n2. Single-glaze wares, either true monochromes or, if of more than one\r\ncolour, the variety of colour arising from changes brought about in the\r\nsingle glaze during the firing.\r\n\r\n3. Porcelain decorated under the glaze. Chiefly blue, less often blue\r\ncombined with red, or red alone.\r\n\r\n4. The decoration given by painting with glazes of more than one colour,\r\nprobably always on the biscuit. We may call this the class of polychrome\r\nglazes.\r\n\r\n5. The decoration painted over the glaze with enamels more fusible than\r\nthe glaze on which they rest.\r\n\r\nPLAIN WHITE WARE.--The white ware made at Ting-chou, a town in the\r\nprovince of Chihli, to the south-west of Pekin, as early as Sung times,\r\nserved as a type for all the many kinds of similar ware made in later\r\ndays at King-te-chen. We have seen (p. 68) that there was a variety, of\r\nthe earlier ware, of creamy tint covered with a soft glaze containing\r\nlead; this is the _Tu-ting_, of which there are several specimens in the\r\nBritish Museum. It was, however, the pure white variety, the\r\n_Feng-ting_, that was afterwards copied. The colour of this ware, when\r\nnot a pure white, tends to blue and greenish tints, and it is often\r\nfinely crackled. This ware, especially the thin, translucent, egg-shell\r\nvariety of the time of Yung-lo (1402-25), is much sought after by\r\nChinese collectors.\r\n\r\nBut the greater part of the plain white Chinese porcelain in European\r\ncollections was not made either at Ting-chou or at King-te-chen. It is\r\nrather to be traced to the only other important centre for the\r\nmanufacture of porcelain that survives in China. This is the district of\r\nTe-hua (Tek-kwa in the local dialect), in the province of Fukien. This\r\nprovince had been famed in Sung times for its tea-bowls covered with a\r\ndark glaze, and we must remember that somewhere along its rocky,\r\nindented coast was situated the port of Zaitun, so famous in early days\r\nfor its Arab trade. In later times the roadstead of Amoy came to rival\r\nCanton as a port of call for our ships; it is mentioned in this\r\nconnection by the Père D’Entrecolles, and from it most of the _blanc de\r\nChine_ which at that time reached Europe was probably exported. For it\r\nwas this Fukien ware rather than the white Ting porcelain that was\r\nimported into Europe from the latter half of the seventeenth century, to\r\nbe copied in the earlier days of Saint-Cloud and Bow. In Spain it was a\r\ngreat favourite from perhaps an earlier date, and when the Buen Retiro\r\nworks were started this ware was taken as a model.\r\n\r\nThis white ware does not seem to have been made at Te-hua before the\r\nMing period, but it soon established itself as the _pai-tsu_--the white\r\nware _par excellence_ of China. It is distinguished by the creamy white\r\nof its paste and glaze--that is to say, the colour tends\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PLATE XV._ 1--CHINESE, PLAIN WHITE WARE\r\n2--CHINESE, BLUE AND WHITE WARE]\r\n\r\ntowards a warm, yellowish tint rather than towards the cold, pure white\r\nor bluish tone of most of the King-te-chen and still more of the\r\nJapanese wares. The satiny glaze appears to melt into the subjacent\r\nground in a way that reminds us of some of the European soft paste\r\nporcelains.\r\n\r\nIt is the moulded ware that is most characteristic of the ‘Kien\r\nyao‘--vases with dragons in full relief creeping round the neck,\r\nincense-burners in many complicated forms, figures of Kwan-yin (whom we\r\nshould _not_ call the ‘Goddess of Mercy‘) in many incarnations; or\r\nagain, Ta-mo (so well known in Japan as Daruma), the _Bodhi-dharma_ who\r\nbrought the faith to China, with overhanging brows and abstracted,\r\nsolemn gaze. Among animals, the favourite is the lion, the so-called\r\n‘dog of Fo,’ sporting with an open-work ball.\r\n\r\nMany of these figures are very ably executed; they stand firm and erect;\r\nand the draperies, though here the mannerisms of the ‘calligraphic’\r\nschool of painting may be recognised, fall in simple folds from the\r\nshoulders. The prevalence of Buddhist types (for the Taoist divinities\r\nare here less frequently represented) may be connected with the\r\nexceptional predominance of that religion in Fukien, a province somewhat\r\nremote from the rest of China, whose inhabitants speak a dialect very\r\ndifferent from the standard Chinese.\r\n\r\nSome very creditable work seems to be still turned out from the Te-kua\r\ndistrict, to judge by the ware that finds its way to the shops of\r\nFuchow. Some enamelled ware appears to have been at one time made in\r\nthis district. In the British Museum are some small pieces decorated\r\nwith five colours (among them a blue enamel _over_ the glaze), which on\r\nthe ground of the nature of the glaze and the paste have been classed as\r\nFukien ware; while from the style of the decoration they would appear to\r\ndate from the early eighteenth century.\r\n\r\nMuch white porcelain, both the Feng-ting and the Fukien, was imported\r\ninto Europe from the end of the seventeenth century, and it forms an\r\nimportant element in old collections. Some of this white ware, at a\r\nlater time, was decorated with colours in England and elsewhere, giving\r\nrise to a class of porcelain that has caused some confusion to\r\ncollectors.\r\n\r\nIn China, white porcelain is used in time of mourning, at least that is\r\nthe case with that supplied to the imperial court.\r\n\r\nUnglazed porcelain is comparatively rare in China, but figures of gods\r\nor of animals are sometimes found in biscuit, and the little boxes in\r\nwhich crickets are kept for fighting are generally of unglazed ware.\r\nAgain, where, as in the class of polychrome glazes, the glaze is applied\r\nwith a brush, some part may be left unglazed; and this practice has\r\nsurvived in the case of the lions and kilins of the _famille verte_,\r\nwhere we often find the biscuit exposed in parts of the face.\r\n\r\nCELADON WARE.--As the white ware of King-te-chen--the _Ting_--has got\r\nits name from the town of Ting-chou where it was first made, so the many\r\nvarieties of celadon[88] porcelain are connected in the Chinese mind\r\nwith the town of Lung-chuan, near the southern boundary of the province\r\nof Chekiang. We have already given some space to this ware, so important\r\nfrom the _cultur-historisch_ point of view, and we shall have to return\r\nto it again when we come to investigate the routes by which the\r\nporcelain of China passed in the Middle Ages to other countries. Here we\r\nwill merely call attention to the later revival of the celadon glazes\r\nmentioned in a passage we have quoted from the letters of the Jesuit\r\nfather. But the highly finished porcelain, with a fine white paste\r\ncovered with a pale greyish-green glaze of uniform thickness and shade,\r\ndiffers much from the old vases with ‘red mouth and foot.’ There is a\r\nremarkably fine specimen in the Wallace collection at Hertford House\r\nwith chased metal mountings of the time of Louis XV., and other pieces\r\nsimilarly mounted in the Jones collection.\r\n\r\nCRACKLE WARE.--It would only create confusion to make a special class\r\nfor the many kinds of ware covered with a crackled glaze. It will be\r\nremembered that we first came across glazes of this kind when describing\r\nthe Ko yao, the ‘ware of the Elder Brother,’ and a large class of\r\nporcelain with white to yellowish grey glaze, always more or less\r\ncrackled, is still commonly known as Ko yao in China, so that ‘Crackle\r\nware’ and ‘Ko yao’ are in a measure equivalent terms. Such crackling may\r\nvary from a division of the surface into large fissures several inches\r\nin length, to the finest reticulation of minute lines hardly visible\r\nwithout a glass. The first the Chinese compare to the cracks of ice, and\r\nI think that it is to a variety of crackle with long spindle-shaped\r\ndivisions that they give the name of ‘crabs claw.’ The finer crackle\r\nthey know as ‘fish-roe‘--this is the _truité_ of the French. Certain\r\nglazes, as the turquoise and the purple of the _demi grand feu_, are\r\nalways finely crackled. In other cases the crackling, which is caused,\r\nas we have already said (p. 32), by the glaze after solidification\r\ncontracting more than the subjacent paste, may be produced or modified\r\nat the will of the potter by adding various substances to the glaze. A\r\nrock that has been identified with steatite has been often mentioned in\r\nthis connection, and the increase in the shrinkage of the glaze\r\nattributed to the magnesia contained in it. Probably, however, a change\r\nin the proportion of the silica to the alumina may be enough to bring\r\nabout a crackled glaze. The following extract from the letters of the\r\nPère D’Entrecolles throws some light on this point. He tells us that\r\nwhen the glaze is made of _cailloux blancs_ (probably little else than\r\nfelspar), without other mixture, we obtain the porcelain called\r\n_Sui-ki_, or ‘shattered ware’ (this is the general Chinese term for\r\ncrackle), ‘marbled all over with an infinity of veins so as to look like\r\na piece of broken porcelain with the pieces remaining in their places.’\r\nThe glaze, we are told, is of a cindery white. We have here a\r\ndescription of the Ko yao, which, however, seems to have been little\r\nknown in Europe at that time. To this class belong the vases with\r\nyellowish grey ground and crackles of medium size. They are often\r\nprovided with mask handles and detached rings. These handles and rings,\r\nas well as some broad bands round the neck, are covered, in imitation of\r\nbronze, with a dark, roughened glaze. Another variety of this Ko yao is\r\ndecorated with scattered patches of white slip, laid on apparently over\r\nthe crackled glazed surface. On this slip is painted the design in\r\ncobalt blue under what is apparently a second glaze. A frequent _motif_\r\non this ware is found in a series of horses in the strangest of\r\npositions. These probably represent the eight famous steeds of the old\r\nemperor Mu-wang. Both these classes of Ko yao are in great favour in\r\nChina and Japan as flower vases. The shapes and decorations are more or\r\nless reminiscent of the old bronzes. It would seem that ware of this\r\nkind is still manufactured at King-te-chen and perhaps somewhere in the\r\nnorth of China also.\r\n\r\nThe brown glazes form a very distinct class. The well-known colour has\r\nmany names: in French _fond laque_; in Chinese _tzu-kin_, or ‘burnished\r\ngold.’ It is also known as ‘dead leaf,’ but the average tint is perhaps\r\nbest described as _café au lait_. The Père D’Entrecolles, in mentioning\r\nthe _tzu-kin_, the colour of which he says is given by a ‘common yellow\r\nearth,’ states that it was a recent invention in his time. He is perhaps\r\nreferring to some special tint, for the colour was well known in Ming\r\ndays. We have already spoken of the possible relation of this colour to\r\nthe\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PLATE XVI._ CHINESE, WHITE SLIP ON BROWN GROUND]\r\n\r\ncopper lustre of the fourteenth century Persian fayence. At a later time\r\nin the seventeenth century it was a favourite colour with the Persians,\r\nespecially when decorated with delicate designs of flowers and ferns in\r\na thin white slip (PL. XVI.). It was largely exported at that time from\r\nChina and cleverly imitated in the fayence and frit-pastes of Persia.\r\nBoth the original Chinese ware and the Persian imitation are well\r\nrepresented at South Kensington by specimens brought from the latter\r\ncountry. This brown glaze is seldom found alone. It is a colour that\r\nstands well the full heat of the furnace, and it may be combined with a\r\nblue and white decoration or with bands of celadon. It forms the\r\nground-colour of the so-called Batavian ware, and at one time a brown\r\nring was by our ancestors held to be essential on the rim of a fine\r\nplate or bowl of blue and white porcelain.\r\n\r\nTURQUOISE AND PURPLE GLAZES.--As for the twin colours of the _demi grand\r\nfeu_ (the yellow in this group is quite subordinate), the so-called\r\nturquoise (including the peacock green and kingfisher blue of the\r\nChinese) and the aubergine purple, the latter is seldom found alone.\r\nBoth colours are distinguished by a very fine-grained crackle. Of the\r\nblue, when used as a single-glaze colour, we have spoken when describing\r\nthe glazes of the _demi grand feu_.\r\n\r\nYELLOW MONOCHROME GLAZES.--There are many shades of yellow found on\r\nChinese porcelain: the imperial yellow of full yolk-of-egg tint, the\r\nlemon yellow, the greenish ‘eel-skin,’ and the ‘boiled chestnut.’ Only\r\nthe first, the imperial yellow, is of importance as a monochrome glaze.\r\nThis is the colour first used in the time of the Ming emperor Hung-chi\r\n(1487-1505), and his name is sometimes found on bowls and plates ranging\r\nin colour from a bright mustard to a boiled chestnut tint. There are\r\nsome good specimens in the British Museum, and a curious piece, with a\r\nPersian inscription, at South Kensington, has already been mentioned\r\nwhen speaking of the reign of Hung-chi.\r\n\r\nCOBALT BLUE MONOCHROME GLAZES.--We may distinguish three varieties of\r\nblue derived from cobalt, but the full sapphire of the blue and white\r\nware is not found as a monochrome glaze:--\r\n\r\n1. The _Clair de lune_. The term _yueh-pai_, or moon-white, was applied\r\nto more than one class of Sung porcelain, but above all to the Ju yao.\r\nIn later times, when these primitive wares were copied, the colour was\r\ngiven by a minute quantity of cobalt, but it is very doubtful whether\r\nthat pigment was known in early Sung days. The _clair de lune_ glazes of\r\nNien were considered second in merit only to the copper reds of that\r\ngreat viceroy. The uncrackled glazes of this class are often classed as\r\nceladon.\r\n\r\n2. The Mazarin blue, known also as _bleu fouetté_ or powder-blue.[89]\r\nThis glaze is blown on to the surface of the raw paste, in the manner\r\ndescribed on page 30. It sometimes covers the whole surface, and is then\r\ngenerally decorated with floral designs in gold, but more often it forms\r\nthe ground for vases and plates with large white reserves on which\r\ndesigns in enamel colours are painted.\r\n\r\n3. The _Gros Bleu_, in the form of large plates and vases, was a great\r\nfavourite with the Arabs and other Mohammedan races. This ware, too, was\r\noften covered with a decoration of gold. There is a magnificent plate of\r\nthis class in the British Museum, and at South Kensington, in the India\r\nMuseum, a tall, dark-blue vase which we have already mentioned. From\r\nPersia come many specimens of this deep blue ware, of a greyish or even\r\nslaty tint, decorated, like the _fond laque_, with flowers in a white\r\nslip.\r\n\r\nBLACK GLAZES.--Very near to this last class of blue glazes we may place\r\nthe ‘metallic black,’ the _wu-chin_ of the Chinese. According to the\r\nPère D’Entrecolles, this mirror-black is prepared by mixing with a glaze\r\ncontaining much lime and some of the same ochry earth that gives the\r\ncolour to the brown glazes, a sufficient quantity of cobalt of poor\r\nquality. In this case no second glaze is required, and the vessel is\r\nfired in the _demi grand feu_, _i.e._ in the front of the furnace. Other\r\nblacks are painted on and covered with a second glaze. The large\r\nspherical vases with tall tubular necks show little trace generally of\r\nthe gold with which the black glaze was originally decorated.\r\n\r\nGREEN GLAZES.--The peculiar tint of green, in varied intensity, that\r\ndistinguishes the _famille verte_ is seldom found as a single glaze; and\r\nof the green Lang yao, made by Lang Ting-tso in the early part of the\r\nreign of Kang-he, it is doubtful whether we have any representatives in\r\nour European collections. This glaze is said to be somewhat in the style\r\nof his more famous _sang de bœuf_.\r\n\r\nThe brilliant cucumber or apple-green of Ming times is shown in a pair\r\nof exquisite little bowls in the British Museum. Over the green glaze\r\nthere is a scroll pattern of gold, and on the inside a blue decoration\r\nunder the glaze. Almost identical with these is the bowl set in a\r\nsilver-gilt mounting of English make dating from about the year 1540,\r\nnow preserved in the Gold Room (PL. V.). Of a similar but somewhat\r\ndeeper tint of green are the rare crackle vases, generally of small\r\nsize, of which there are specimens in the British Museum and in the\r\nSalting collection.[90]\r\n\r\nOLIVE AND BRONZE GLAZES.--The monochrome glazes of various shades of\r\nolive and bronze are for the most part produced by a _soufflé_ process,\r\nin which on a base of one colour a second colour is sprinkled. Thus to\r\nform the ‘tea-dust’ a green glaze is blown over a reddish ground derived\r\nfrom iron. The wonderful bronze glazes, of which there are good\r\nspecimens in the British Museum and in the Salting collection, are\r\nproduced in a similar way. But some of these (and the same may be said\r\nof the ‘iron rusts‘) partake rather of the nature of the more elaborated\r\nglazes of the _flambé_ class.\r\n\r\nRED AND FLAMBÉ GLAZES (PL. XVII.).--We have left the red glazes to the\r\nlast, both from the complicated nature of the class and because one\r\nvariety, the _sang de bœuf_, forms a transition to the ‘splashed’ or\r\n_flambé_ division. A red glaze or enamel, we have seen, can be produced\r\nfrom three metals,--from gold, from copper, and from iron. With the\r\n_Rose d’or_, which may be classed as a monochrome enamel, when used to\r\ncover the backs of plates and bowls, we are not concerned here--it is\r\nnot properly a glaze in our sense of the word. The red derived from the\r\nsesqui-oxide of iron was only successfully applied as a monochrome when,\r\nat a late period, the difficulties attending its use were overcome by\r\ncombining the pigment with an alkaline flux. This is the _Mo-hung_ or\r\n‘painted red’ of the muffle-stove, which was painted over the already\r\nglazed ware, and therefore not properly itself a glaze. In fine\r\nspecimens it approaches to a vermilion colour; it is the jujube red of\r\nthe Chinese. It is with this colour, laid upon the elaborately modelled\r\npaste, that the carved cinnabar lacquer is so wonderfully imitated.[91]\r\n\r\nBut it is the red derived from copper that presents the most points of\r\ninterest. Indeed we now enter upon a series of glazes, beginning with\r\nthe pure deep red of\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PLATE XVII._ CHINESE]\r\n\r\nthe _sang de bœuf_, and then passing over the line to the long series of\r\nvariegated or ‘transmutation‘[92] glazes that have more than any others\r\nfascinated the modern amateurs of ceramic problems. We have already seen\r\nhow these magic effects are produced by carefully modulating the passage\r\nof the oxidising currents through an otherwise smoky and reducing\r\natmosphere in the furnace (p. 42).\r\n\r\nThe typical _sang de bœuf_, or the ‘red of the sacrifice,’ as the\r\nChinese call it, was that made under the _régime_ of Lang Ting-tso a\r\nforerunner of the three great directors of the imperial manufactory at\r\nKing-te-chen, and in later times it was always the aim of the potter to\r\nimitate his work--the Lang yao--even in trifling details. According to\r\nthe Père D’Entrecolles, to obtain this red the Chinese made use of a\r\nfinely granulated copper which they obtained from the silver refiners,\r\nand which therefore probably contained silver. Some other very\r\nremarkable substances, he tells us, entered into the composition, but of\r\nthese it is the less necessary to speak, as he confesses that great\r\nsecrecy was maintained on the subject.\r\n\r\nIn looking carefully _into_ a glaze of this kind, the deep\r\ncolouring-matter is seen suspended in a more or less greenish or\r\nyellowish transparent matrix, in the form of streaks and clots of a\r\nnearly opaque material.[93] The hue, in general effect, varies from a\r\ndeep blood-red to various shades of orange and brown, but intimately\r\nmixed with the red, certain bluish streaks are sometimes to be seen in\r\none part or another of the surface. The colours should stop evenly at\r\nthe rim and at the base, which parts, if this is achieved, are covered\r\nwith a transparent glaze of pale greenish or yellowish tint.\r\n\r\nWe have already seen that much depends upon the period of the firing at\r\nwhich the glaze becomes liquid or soft, and upon the exact degree of\r\nfluidity attained by it. Should the oxidising currents be allowed\r\nfurther play at the critical period of the firing, the blue and greenish\r\nstains and splashes will become more predominant, and we may either pass\r\nover to the _flambé_ or ‘transmutation’ glazes, or finally the glaze may\r\nbecome almost white and transparent.\r\n\r\nBut we must hark back to the wares of the Sung period, to the Chün yao,\r\nto find the origin of these variegated glazes. These early Sung glazes\r\nwere copied in the time of Yung-cheng, and if we are to believe the\r\ncontemporary list, already quoted, of the objects copied, they were of a\r\nvery complicated nature. In this class of _flambé_ ware we must include\r\nalso a large part of the so-called _Yuan tsu_ (see p. 77), a heavy\r\nkaolinic stoneware, certainly not all dating from the Yuan or Mongol\r\nperiod--a ware, indeed, still common in the north of China. This ware is\r\nroughly covered with a glaze of predominant lavender tint, speckled with\r\nred, and thus approaches to the ‘robin’s egg’ glaze of the American\r\ncollector, though this latter is found on a finer porcelain of later\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nAnother name which has been used to include many of these variegated\r\nglazes is _Yao-pien_ or ‘furnace-transmutation.’ This last word very\r\nwell expresses the process by which the colour is developed, but it must\r\nbe remembered that this is not exactly the meaning that the word\r\n_yao-pien_ conveys to the Chinese mind.[94] With this term the happy\r\naccidents of the furnace were linked by the Père D’Entrecolles: he tells\r\nus that it was proposed to make a sacrificial red, but that the vase\r\ncame from the furnace like a kind of agate. Dr. Bushell thinks that\r\nmost of the fine pieces of this ware date from the time of Yung-cheng\r\nand Kien-lung (1722-1795), and he is of opinion that they were prepared\r\nby a _soufflé_ process rather than by any ‘academic transformation’ of a\r\ncopper-red glaze. ‘The piece,’ he says, ‘coated with a greyish crackle\r\nglaze or with a ferruginous enamel of yellowish-brown tone, has the\r\ntransmutation glaze applied at the same time as a kind of overcoat. It\r\nis put on with the brush in various ways, in thick dashes not completely\r\ncovering the surface of the piece, or flecked as with the point of the\r\nbrush in a rain of drops. The piece is finally fired in a reducing\r\natmosphere, and the air, let in at the critical moment when the\r\nmaterials are fully fused, imparts atoms of oxygen to the copper and\r\nspeckles the red base with points of green and turquoise blue’\r\n(_Oriental Ceramic Art_, pp. 516-17). Some practical experiments lately\r\nmade in France would tend to show that the critical moment should be\r\nplaced a little earlier, _before_ the glaze is completely fused, for\r\nafter that point is reached the surrounding atmosphere has little\r\ninfluence upon the metallic oxides in the glaze. It is to this\r\ncapricious action of the furnace gases that are due those wonderful\r\neffects that may be observed in looking _into_ these glazes, curdled\r\nmasses of strange shapes and varying colour suspended in a more or less\r\ntransparent medium, and assuming at times those textures resembling\r\nanimal tissues which are graphically described by the Chinese as pig’s\r\nliver or mule’s lungs. It must be understood that into many of the more\r\nmodern and _apprêtés_ specimens of _flambé_ ware the sources of the\r\nviolent contrasts of colour are found not only in the oxides of copper\r\nand iron, but in those of cobalt and manganese also.\r\n\r\nBut in contrast to ‘the stern delights’ of these flamboyant wares there\r\nis another kind of glaze, chemically closely allied, for it is also of\r\ntransmutation copper origin, of which the associations are of another\r\nkind. This is the peach-bloom, the ‘apple-red and green,’ or again the\r\n‘kidney-bean’ glaze of the Chinese. Although claiming an origin from\r\nMing times, this glaze is always associated with the great viceroy Tsang\r\nYing-hsuan. The little vases and water-vessels of a pale pinkish red,\r\nmore or less mottled and varying in intensity, are highly prized by\r\nChinese collectors.\r\n\r\nDECORATION WITH SLIP.--There is a class of ware which might perhaps\r\nclaim a separate division for itself--I mean that decorated with an\r\n_engobe_ or slip. We have already mentioned the most important cases\r\nwhere this _engobe_ is applied to the surface of single-glazed wares:\r\nthese are, in the first place, the _fond laque_ (PL. XVI.), and in a\r\nless degree certain blue and even white wares. The slip, of a cream-like\r\nconsistency, is as a rule painted on with a brush over the glaze,\r\ngenerally, I think, after a preliminary firing.[95] This _engobe_ may\r\nthen itself be decorated with colours, as we have seen in the case of\r\nthe Ko yao, and the whole surface probably then covered with a second\r\nglaze.[96] Sometimes when the ground itself is nearly white we get an\r\neffect like the _bianco sopra bianco_ of Italian majolica. This\r\ncarefully prepared and finely ground _engobe_ contains, in some cases at\r\nleast, the same materials as those employed in the preparation of the\r\nSha-tai or ‘sand-bodied’ porcelain.\r\n\r\nPIERCED OR OPEN-WORK DECORATION (PL. XVIII. 1).--We may here find place\r\nfor another kind of decoration, one much admired in Europe in the\r\neighteenth century.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PLATE XVIII._ 1--CHINESE, PIERCED WARE, BLUE AND WHITE\r\n2--CHINESE, BLUE AND WHITE WARE]\r\n\r\nThis is obtained by piercing the paste so as to form an open-work\r\ndesign, generally some simple diapered or key pattern, but sometimes\r\nflowers or figures of cranes. The little apertures or windows thus\r\nformed may be filled in by the glaze (if this is sufficiently viscous to\r\nstretch across them) in the simple process of dipping. In this case the\r\nglaze takes in part the place of the paste, and indeed in the closely\r\nallied ‘Gombroon’ ware of Persia it is the thick, viscous glaze rather\r\nthan the friable sandy paste that holds the vessel together. It is the\r\nplain white ware to which this decoration is generally applied in China.\r\nThere is one class where this pierced work is associated with groups of\r\nlittle figures, in biscuit, in high or full relief--as is well\r\nillustrated by a series of small cups in the Salting collection, some of\r\nwhich bear traces of gilding and colours.\r\n\r\nThe term ‘rice-grain’ was originally applied to the open-work diapers\r\nfilled in with glaze. As a whole this kind of work may be referred to\r\nthe later part of the reign of Kien-lung, and especially to that of his\r\nsuccessor, Kia-king (1795-1820), so that it is not unlikely that the\r\nPersian frit-ware, some of which is of earlier date, may have served as\r\na model.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLUE AND WHITE WARE.--This is, on the whole, the most important as well\r\nas the best defined class of Chinese porcelain. The Chinese name, _Ching\r\nhua pai ti_ (literally ‘blue flowers white ground‘), defines its nature\r\nwell enough.\r\n\r\nWe have no information as to the origin and development of blue and\r\nwhite porcelain in China, nor indeed do I know of any collection where\r\nan attempt has been made to classify the vast material. We must here\r\ncontent ourselves with a few notes which at best may indicate the ground\r\non which such a classification should be made. We have seen (p. 75)\r\nthat there is at least some presumptive evidence that the Chinese may\r\nhave derived their knowledge of the use of cobalt (as a material to\r\ndecorate the ground of their porcelain) from Western Asia, at a time\r\nwhen both China and Persia were governed by one family of Mongol khans.\r\nFor we know now that in Syria or in Persia, in the twelfth or early in\r\nthe thirteenth century, a rough but artistic ware was painted with a\r\nhasty decoration of cobalt blue and covered with a thick alkaline glaze;\r\nwhile in China, at that time, we have no evidence for the existence of\r\nany porcelain other than monochrome.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that the earliest Chinese type of the under-glaze blue\r\nmay be found in certain thick brownish crackle ware, decorated under the\r\nglaze, in blue, with a few strokes of the brush. Plates and dishes of\r\nthis kind have been found in Borneo, associated with early types of\r\nceladon.[97] A similar ware, not necessarily of great antiquity, is\r\noften found in common use in the north of China and, I think, in Korea,\r\nand with it we may perhaps associate the greyish-yellow Ko yao decorated\r\nwith patches of blue and white slip.\r\n\r\nIt is very likely that there would be a strong opposition on the part of\r\nthe Chinese literati to such a novel and exotic mode of decoration, but\r\nthat such opposition would be less felt in the case of ware made for\r\nexportation, or it may be for use among the less conservative Mongols.\r\nWe have an instance of a similar feeling in the protest that we know was\r\nmade some two or three hundred years later against the application of\r\ncoloured enamels to the surface of porcelain.\r\n\r\nOf the thousands of specimens of blue and white porcelain in our\r\ncollections there is probably no single piece for which we can claim a\r\ndate earlier than the fifteenth century. We can, however, distinguish\r\ntwo\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PLATE XIX._ CHINESE BLUE AND WHITE WARE]\r\n\r\ntypes among the examples, which for the reasons given on page 83 we may\r\nsafely assign to the Ming period. The first is distinguished by a pure\r\nbut pale blue, and the design (generally somewhat sparingly applied) is\r\ncarefully drawn with a fine brush. This, it would seem, was the ware\r\nimitated by the Japanese at the princely kilns of Mikawaji. The other\r\ntype is distinguished by the depth and brilliancy of its colour, the\r\ntrue sapphire tint, differing from the later blue of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, in which there is always a purplish tendency. There are some\r\ngood specimens of this type in the British Museum, but we will take as\r\nour standard a jar at South Kensington about twelve inches in height\r\n(PL. XIX.). The remarkable thickness of the paste in this vase shown in\r\nthe neck, which has at some time been cut down, the marks of the\r\njunction of the moulded pieces of which it was built up, the slight\r\npatina developed in the surface of the glaze, are all signs that point\r\nto an early origin. But what is above all noticeable is the jewel-like\r\nbrilliancy of the blue pigment with which the decoration--a design of\r\n_kilin_ sporting under pine-trees--is painted.\r\n\r\nWhen we come to the reign of Wan-li (1572-1619), to which time we may\r\nassign the beginning of the direct exportation to Europe of Chinese\r\nporcelain, a period of decline has already set in. The rare pieces of\r\nblue and white so prized in Elizabethan and early Stuart days are in no\r\nway remarkable either in their execution or in their decoration.\r\n\r\nWe come now to an important class of blue and white ware which looms out\r\nlarge in many collections. I mean the big plates and jars with roughly\r\nexecuted designs often showing a Persian influence. The blue is never\r\npure--indeed it is often little better than a slaty grey, and sometimes\r\nalmost black. Most of what the dealers now know as ‘Ming porcelain’ may\r\nbe included in this class. To understand the source of this porcelain we\r\nmust refer the reader to what we shall have to say in Chapter XIII.\r\nabout the trade of China with Persia in the time of Shah Abbas and with\r\nthe north of India, during the reigns of the great Mogul rulers of the\r\nseventeenth century. The increasing demand from these countries\r\ncoincided with a period of decline in China, for the period between the\r\ndeath of Wan-li in 1620 and the revival of the manufacture at\r\nKing-te-chen towards the end of that century, is almost a blank in the\r\nhistory of Chinese porcelain. But the export trade that had sprung up at\r\nthe end of the sixteenth century was actively carried on in spite of the\r\npolitical troubles, and at no other time was the nature of the ware\r\nproduced so largely influenced by the foreign demand. But this demand\r\nwas at first chiefly for the Mohammedan East, and what reached Europe\r\nwas mostly the result of re-exportation from India and from the Persian\r\nGulf.[98] This picturesque and decorative ware is well represented at\r\nSouth Kensington by specimens obtained in Persia, and many fine pieces\r\nhave lately been brought from India. Of this class of blue and white\r\nware we have already spoken in a former chapter (see p. 84).\r\n\r\nIn Egypt, again, blue and white porcelain was greatly appreciated both\r\nfor decorative purposes and for common use. Large plates and dishes\r\npainted with a scale-like pattern, formed of petals of flowers, are\r\nstill to be found in the old Arab houses of Cairo.\r\n\r\nAlready by the beginning of the seventeenth century plates and bowls of\r\nthe Sinico-Persian type must have reached Holland in large quantities,\r\nand we find them frequently introduced into their pictures by the\r\nstill-life painters of the time. I will only give two examples: (1) A\r\nlarge still-life at Dresden by Frans Snyders (1579-1657), where as many\r\nas eight plates and bowls, mostly roughly decorated with a greyish\r\ncobalt _sous couverte_, are introduced; (2) a small picture in the\r\nLouvre by William Kalff (1621-1693). Here we see a large ‘ginger-jar’\r\nwith deep blue ground and white reserves. The porcelain introduced by\r\nthe Dutch painters is without exception of the blue and white class, and\r\nin the earlier works the slaty blue tints are the most common.\r\n\r\nBut European influence must now and then have made itself felt in China\r\nbefore this time, to judge by some large jars at Dresden decorated with\r\narabesques of unmistakable renaissance type. One of these has been\r\nfitted with a lid of Delft ware, made to match the other covers of\r\nChinese origin, and this Dutch-made lid cannot be dated later than the\r\nfirst half of the seventeenth century.[99]\r\n\r\nBut it is to the next age that the bulk of the vast collection of blue\r\nand white brought together at Dresden by Augustus the Strong belongs.\r\nThe _lange Lijzen_, the famous dragon-vases, the large fish-bowls, and\r\nthe endless series of smaller objects collected by his agents from every\r\nside, have made this royal collection a place of pilgrimage for all\r\nchina maniacs since his day. Not that the general average of the blue\r\nand white ware is very high. We find here for the first time specimens\r\nof the famous ‘hawthorn ginger-jars’ so dear to later collectors of\r\n‘Nankin china.’ Of course this porcelain did not come from Nankin, the\r\njars were never used for ginger, and the decoration was not derived from\r\nthe hawthorn--a flower unknown in Chinese art. But it is in these jars\r\nthat the modern connoisseur, both in England and America, has found the\r\ncompletest expression and highest triumph of the art of the Far East. No\r\nwords are too strong to express his enthusiasm. We are especially told\r\nto look for a certain ‘palpitating quality’ in the blue ground. We hear\r\nfrom Dr. Bushell that these ‘hawthorn jars’ are in China especially\r\nassociated with the New Year; filled with various objects they are then\r\ngiven as presents. The decoration of prunus flowers (a species allied to\r\nour blackthorn) is relieved against a background of ice, and it is the\r\nrendering of this crackled ice in varying shades of blue that gives the\r\nspecial _cachet_ to the ware.[100]\r\n\r\nThere is a curious variety of blue and white in which the outline of the\r\ndesign is filled up by a hatching of cross-lines as in an engraving. The\r\nprototype of this kind of decoration probably dates from Ming times, and\r\nit may possibly be derived from some kind of textile.\r\n\r\n\r\nENAMEL COLOURS OVER THE GLAZE.--We have already attempted to follow the\r\nstages by which the application of enamel colours over the glaze found\r\nits way into general use. We saw that before the introduction of fusible\r\nenamels melting at the gentle heat of the muffle-stove, somewhat similar\r\neffects were obtained by painting with certain colours upon the already\r\nfired body or paste--on a biscuit ground, in fact. The coloured slip\r\nused in this way, differing in no respect from a true glaze, was then\r\nsubjected to a fire of medium intensity, that is to say, it was exposed\r\nto the _demi grand feu_ of the kiln.\r\n\r\nI think that the obscure problem of the nature of the coloured ware so\r\nminutely described by Chinese writers and ascribed by them to early\r\nMing times, and the relation of this ware to the first forms of the\r\n_famille verte_ can only find its solution by allowing a wider play to\r\nthe use of painting on biscuit and subsequent refiring, and that there\r\nmay probably have existed intermediate stages between the _demi grand\r\nfeu_ and the fully developed muffle-stove. It is indeed possible that\r\nthe same pieces may have successively been exposed to both these\r\nfires.[101]\r\n\r\nThe curious bowl, of very archaic aspect, lately added to the Salting\r\ncollection (see note, p. 89), illustrates well the difficulties in\r\naccepting as final a decision as to date based upon the nature of the\r\nenamel. This bowl bears the nien-hao of Ching-te (1505-21), and may well\r\ndate from that time, but among the enamel colours over the glaze we find\r\na cobalt blue (of a poor lavender tint indeed); we are told, however,\r\nthat the use of cobalt as an enamel colour was unknown before the time\r\nof Kang-he.[102]\r\n\r\nOf the many schemes and varieties of decoration that crop up in the\r\ncourse of the eighteenth century as a consequence of the increased\r\npalette at the command of the enameller and of the miscellaneous demand\r\nfor foreign countries, we have already said something. Many important\r\ntypes must remain unmentioned, and some are indeed scarcely represented\r\nin our home collections. Of this I will give, in conclusion, a striking\r\ninstance. In the whole of the great collection at Dresden, now so\r\nadmirably arranged by Dr. Zimmermann, there is perhaps nothing more\r\nstriking than the circular stand covered with a trophy of large vases,\r\nthe decoration of which, though bold in general effect, is entirely\r\nbuilt up by fine lines of iron-red helped out by a little gold. These\r\nvases, from their fine technique, I should assign to the end of the\r\nreign of Kang-he, or possibly to that of Yung-cheng (1722-35). It is a\r\ncurious fact that by these parallel lines of iron-red an effect is\r\nproduced at a distance very similar to that obtained by a wash of the\r\n_rouge d’or_. Possibly the aim was to imitate that colour. I have seen a\r\nsimilar effect produced by red hatching on some English ware of the\r\neighteenth century. I do not think that this porcelain was made for the\r\nPersian market, as has been asserted, for in that case we should find\r\nspecimens of it in the South Kensington collection.[103] There is, I\r\nthink, only one example of this ware in the British Museum, and in the\r\nSalting collection only a pair of insignificant cups and saucers. On the\r\nother hand, in the Dresden collection, whole classes even of eighteenth\r\ncentury wares are unrepresented. I mention these facts to accentuate the\r\nvast field covered by Chinese porcelain. It must be borne in mind that\r\nthe Chinese manufactured for the whole civilised world, and that the\r\ntaste and fashion in each country influenced, though often very\r\nindirectly, and in a way not always to be recognised at first sight, the\r\nforms and the decoration of the objects exported to it. This influence,\r\nmaking for variety and change, has been in constant conflict with, and\r\nhas counteracted, the native conservative habit. It is an influence that\r\nhas probably made itself felt from very early days, but it culminated in\r\nthe eighteenth century. Indeed the rapid decline of Chinese porcelain\r\nthat set in before the end of that century was in no small degree\r\npromoted by the unintelligent demand from Western countries at that\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nWe shall later on have to look upon this question\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate XX.\r\n\r\n_Chinese Design in red and gold._]\r\n\r\nfrom a reversed point of view, and we shall have to notice how the\r\nfictile wares of other countries were influenced, and finally in part\r\nreplaced by the products of the kilns of King-te-chen. For in any\r\ngeneral history of porcelain this influence of the East upon the West,\r\ntogether with the return current from West to East, is the central\r\nquestion. By bearing in mind these mutual influences a simplicity and\r\nunity are given to this history which we might look for in vain in that\r\nof any other art of equal importance.\r\n\r\nHow the porcelain of King-te-chen found its way at first to the\r\nsurrounding minor states--to Korea, to Indo-China, and to Japan--and was\r\nmore or less successfully copied in these countries; how, on the other\r\nhand, in India and in Persia the foreign ware, though long in general\r\nuse, was never imitated;[104] and how, finally, after reaching the\r\nChristian West this porcelain influenced and in part replaced the\r\nhomemade fayence, even before the secret of its composition was\r\ndiscovered--these, I think, are the prime factors in the history of\r\nporcelain.\r\n\r\nIt will, however, be convenient to say something of the porcelain made\r\nin the surrounding countries, especially in Japan, before taking up the\r\nsubject of the Chinese commerce with Europe, for this reason among\r\nothers: the products of the Japanese kilns became so inextricably mixed\r\nup with those of King-te-chen in the course of their journey to the\r\nWest, that it would be impossible to treat of the one class apart from\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\nBut before ending with the porcelain of China we must take a rapid\r\nglance at a large and complicated group--that decorated wholly or in\r\npart in European style.\r\n\r\nQuite early in the century, perhaps before 1700, figures and groups in\r\nplain white ware, for the most part attired in the European costume of\r\nthe day, were exported from China. Many of these grotesque figures may\r\nbe seen in the great Dresden collection, and a few in the British\r\nMuseum. Later on it became the fashion for the European merchants at\r\nCanton to supply the native enamellers of that city with engravings, to\r\nbe copied by them in colours on the white ware sent down from\r\nKing-te-chen. In other cases the captain of a Dutch or English vessel\r\nlying in the Canton roads would employ a native artist to decorate a\r\nplate or dish with a picture of his good ship.\r\n\r\nBut the most frequent task given to these Canton enamellers was the\r\nreproduction of elaborate coats of arms upon the centre of a plate or\r\ndish, or sometimes upon a whole dinner-service. There is in the British\r\nMuseum a remarkable collection of this armorial china, brought together\r\nfor the most part by the late Sir A. W. Franks.[105] Orders came not\r\nfrom England alone, but from Holland, Sweden, Germany, and even Russia.\r\nServices were thus decorated for Frederick the Great and other royal\r\nheads. The practice seems to have been kept up during the whole of the\r\neighteenth century, but we do not know the precise date at which it was\r\nintroduced. In a few cases--the large Talbot plate in the British Museum\r\nis an instance (PL. XXI.)--the arms were painted in blue under the\r\nglaze, and such decoration was probably executed at King-te-chen. The\r\nsmall plate with the Okeover arms in the same collection was, according\r\nto the family tradition, ordered as early as the year 1700, but the\r\ndecoration in my opinion would undoubtedly point to a later date[106]\r\n(PL. XII. 2).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PLATE XXI._ CHINESE, BLUE AND WHITE WARE]\r\n\r\nIt is hardly necessary at the present day to mention that this armorial\r\nchina has nothing to do with Lowestoft. A fictitious interest was,\r\nhowever, long given to this ware by its strange attribution to that\r\ntown.\r\n\r\nMuch Chinese porcelain, either plain white or sparely decorated under\r\nthe glaze with blue, was imported during the eighteenth century, to be\r\ndaubed over, often in the worst taste, with a profusion of gaudy\r\ncolours, in Holland, in Germany, and in England. At Venice, too, the\r\nplain Oriental ware was at one time elaborately painted with a black\r\nenamel.\r\n\r\nMore interest attaches to the porcelain enamelled at Canton for the\r\nIndian market. The Chinese seem in some way to have associated the\r\n_yang-tsai_ or ‘foreign colours’ with the enamels made in the south of\r\nIndia, especially at Calicut, and it is possible that Indian patterns\r\nand schemes of colour may have influenced some of the developments of\r\nthe _famille rose_. The Canton enamellers must at the same time have\r\nbeen working on the richly decorated ware for the Siamese market, but it\r\nis on their enamel paintings on copper that the Indo-Siamese influence\r\nis chiefly seen (see next chapter).\r\n\r\nNor were these exotic schemes of decoration confined to the Canton\r\nenamellers. At more than one time there was something like a rage for\r\ncopying foreign designs--Japanese, among others--at King-te-chen, and\r\nthat not for trade purposes alone, for as we have mentioned already,\r\nboth Kang-he and Kien-lung seem to have taken a passing interest in the\r\nstrange productions of the outer barbarian.\r\n\r\nOf the many kinds of ceramic wares made in different parts of China\r\nwhich from the opacity of the paste we cannot class as porcelain, we can\r\nonly mention two, both of which would probably come under the head of\r\nour kaolinic stoneware:--1. The YI-HSING YAO, made at a place of that\r\nname not far from Shanghai, which includes the red unglazed ware,\r\nesteemed by the Chinese for the brewing of tea. This is the so-called\r\nBoccaro successfully copied by Böttger. Sometimes we find this stoneware\r\npainted with enamel colours thickly laid on, and the design is often\r\naccentuated by ridges or _cloisons_. 2. The KUANG YAO, of which there\r\nare two classes. The ware made near Amoy is a yellowish to brownish\r\nstoneware, thickly glazed and rudely decorated. This coarse pottery is\r\nmuch in favour with the Chinese colonists in America and elsewhere.\r\nAgain in the south of the province of Kuang-tung, at Yang-chiang-hsien,\r\na reddish stoneware has long been made. It is covered with a thick\r\nglaze, often mottled, more or less blue, and sometimes resembling the\r\n_flambé_ glazes of King-te-chen. Indeed this Kuang yao at one time was\r\ncopied at the latter place.[107] It is often stated that true porcelain\r\nwas made in Kuang-tung, but the evidence on the whole is against this.\r\nWe will quote, however, what the Abbé Raynal says (_Histoire du Commerce\r\ndes Européens dans les Deux Indes_, 1770). He states that competition\r\nwith King-te-chen had been abandoned ‘excepté au voisinage de Canton, où\r\non fabrique la porcelaine connue sous le nom de porcelaine des Indes. La\r\npâte en est longue et facile; mais en général les couleurs sont très\r\ninférieures. Toutes les couleurs, excepté le bleu, y relèvent en bosse\r\net sont communément mal appliquées. La plupart des tasses, des assiettes\r\net des autres vases que portent nos négocians, sortent de cette\r\nmanufacture, moins estimée à la Chine que ne le sont dans nos contrées\r\ncelles de fayence.‘[108] Compare with this what we have said about the\r\nrough porcelain exported to India in the seventeenth century (p. 85).\r\n\r\nSince the extinction of the Ting kilns an opaque white stoneware has\r\nbeen largely manufactured in the north, and near Pekin a commoner\r\nearthenware is largely made (Bushell, pp. 631-638).\r\n\r\nThe bricks with which the Porcelain Tower of Nankin was constructed were\r\nfor the most part composed of a kaolinic stoneware.\r\n\r\nFinally, we should point out that nearly all these various kinds of\r\nstoneware are represented in the British Museum collection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTHE PORCELAIN OF KOREA AND OF THE INDO-CHINESE PENINSULA\r\n\r\n\r\nKOREA\r\n\r\nThe self-contained culture of the Middle Kingdom spread at an early time\r\nto the less advanced and more or less tributary countries that\r\nsurrounded it: on the south to the confused complex of states that are\r\nconveniently grouped together as Indo-China; on the north to Korea; and\r\non the east, or more accurately on the north-east, to Japan. To these\r\nislands, however, the Chinese civilisation for the most part spread by\r\nway of Korea, and as this was in a measure the route taken in the case\r\nof the potter’s art, it may be well to deal first with the great\r\nnorthern peninsula.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese claim to have conquered and even incorporated Korea as long\r\nago as the Tang dynasty (618-907 A.D.), and even before that time the\r\ncountry had been overrun by the Japanese. The latter people have at all\r\ntimes presented themselves to the Koreans as ruthless conquerors and\r\npirates, and indeed they succeeded during their last great expedition at\r\nthe end of the sixteenth century in sweeping the country so bare that to\r\nthis day its poverty and the low state of its artistic culture is\r\ngenerally attributed to this gigantic razzia from which the country\r\nnever recovered. And yet Korea has always taken a place in Japanese\r\nestimation second only to China as a source of their artistic and\r\npractical knowledge, if not of their literature and philosophy; and this\r\nis especially the case with regard to the potter’s craft--the technical\r\npart of it above all. Time and again do we hear of famous Korean\r\npotters, or even of whole families and tribes, being brought over and\r\nset to work by the local Japanese ruler either with the materials they\r\nbrought with them, or with the clays and glazes that their experience\r\nenabled them to discover in their new homes.\r\n\r\nWe need not, therefore, be surprised to find that after the wonders of\r\nJapan had been laid open to the admiration of the West, the greatest\r\nhopes were entertained of finding artistic treasures at least as\r\nvaluable in the great peninsula to the west which still remained a\r\nforbidden land. Failing direct evidence of this wealth, it became the\r\nhabit to attribute to Korea any Oriental ware, old or new, of which the\r\norigin was unknown. This tendency was taken advantage of by more than\r\none enterprising dealer, and when at a later time the country was in a\r\nmeasure thrown open, cases of gorgeously decorated Japanese ware,\r\nbrand-new from Yokohama or Nagasaki, were sent round by way of Chemulpo,\r\nthe port of the Korean capital, so that their Korean origin could be\r\nguaranteed. Long before this, the home of an important group of Japanese\r\nporcelain, that now generally known as ‘Kakiyemon,’ had been found by\r\nJacquemart in Korea. Now that of late years these various fallacies and\r\n_supercheries_ have been exposed, and that the extreme poverty of the\r\nland in artistic work of any kind has been demonstrated, we may perhaps\r\nsee a tendency to an undue depreciation of the artistic capabilities of\r\nthe country in former days. We must at any rate remember that the\r\nJapanese experts, who are in the best position to know, have always\r\nmaintained that the Koreans in the sixteenth century were possessed of\r\nthe secret of enamelling in colour upon porcelain, or, at all events,\r\nthat they were acquainted with the coloured glazes of the _demi grand\r\nfeu_, and that so good an authority as Captain Brinkley has accepted, as\r\nof Korean origin, specimens of enamelled ware still existing in Japanese\r\ncollections.\r\n\r\nMeantime we must be contented with the scanty examples of pottery,\r\nstoneware, and porcelain that have been actually brought home from\r\nKorea, and among these pieces we must discriminate between the wares of\r\nnative manufacture and the porcelain that had been imported from China,\r\neither overland by way of Niu-chuang or across the Gulf of Petchili from\r\nthe ports of Shantung. Of late years many specimens have been collected,\r\nchiefly at Seoul, the capital, especially by members of the various\r\nforeign legations, and some of these have found their way into European\r\nmuseums.[109]\r\n\r\nApart from some small pieces of modern blue and white and enamelled\r\nwares, undoubtedly of true porcelain, but very rough in execution and\r\npoor in colour, which are said to be of local manufacture, we find:--\r\n\r\n1. A plain white ware often showing signs of age, but apparently in no\r\nway differing from the ivory-white ware of Fukien. Japanese experts,\r\nhowever, claim to distinguish pieces of Korean origin. Such specimens\r\nare much valued in Japan, and some are said to have been brought back\r\nafter the great expedition at the end of the sixteenth century. We find\r\nalso specimens of a heavy white ware, with decoration in a high relief,\r\nwhich is undoubtedly of native origin. At Sèvres is a large white vase,\r\nwith dragons in relief, brought from Seoul.\r\n\r\n2. Celadon porcelain, of many types. Of this ware there are many\r\nspecimens in our museums. At Sèvres we find two bowls of a fine rich\r\ntint of olive green, presented by the King of Korea to the late\r\nPresident Carnot ‘as the most valuable of the ancient productions of his\r\npoor country.’ In the same collection may be seen a case full of\r\nimportant specimens brought back in 1893 by M. de Plancy, the French\r\ndiplomatic agent at Seoul. Among them are some large rude celadon vases,\r\none with some attempts at blue decoration under the glaze. In the\r\nBritish Museum are several celadon bowls, some with moulded floral\r\npatterns in relief. Among some bowls of a greyish celadon from Korea, in\r\nthe Ethnographical Museum at Dresden, I noticed some with an unglazed\r\nring on the upper surface, pointing to a primitive method of support in\r\nthe furnace, perhaps similar to that formerly employed in Siam. Dr.\r\nBushell quotes from a Chinese work on Korea, written in the first half\r\nof the twelfth century, an account of the elaborately moulded wine-cups\r\nand vessels of all kinds made in that country. This ware is described as\r\nof a kingfisher green, but it may probably be regarded as a\r\nfull-coloured variety of celadon. This interpretation is confirmed by a\r\nlater Chinese work (published 1387), which distinctly says--I quote from\r\nDr. Bushell’s translation--‘The ceramic objects produced in the ancient\r\nKorean kilns were of a greyish green colour resembling the celadon ware\r\nof Lung-chuan. There was one kind overlaid with white sprays of flowers,\r\nbut this was not valued so very highly’ (_Oriental Ceramic Art_, p.\r\n681).\r\n\r\n3. An important class of Korean ware is formed by the coarsely crackled\r\npieces of brownish or yellow colour, which in China would probably be\r\nclassed as Ko yao. These are often roughly decorated with daubs of blue\r\nunder the glaze, resembling in this some of the older pieces brought\r\nfrom Borneo.\r\n\r\n4. A greyish ware, inlaid with designs of white slip, on the principle\r\nof our ‘encaustic tiles’ of the Middle Ages. This is perhaps the only\r\noriginal type that we can connect with Korea, and it would seem that\r\nthis is the ware alluded to at the end of the quotation we have just\r\ngiven from an old Chinese book. This inlaid ware appears to have been\r\ngreatly admired by the Japanese, for it was closely imitated in more\r\nthan one district. The well-known Yatsushiro pottery, first made in the\r\nprovince of Higo in the seventeenth century, is distinctly a copy of\r\nthis Korean model. Among the specimens at Sèvres brought home by M. de\r\nPlancy, there is a tall vase of this type cut down in the neck decorated\r\nwith flying cranes in white slip. This ware, however, is not a true\r\nporcelain; at the best it is a kind of kaolinic stoneware, and the same\r\nmay be said of most of the old heavy pieces brought back from Korea.\r\n\r\nThere is not much in the way of decorative design to be found on any of\r\nthe varieties of Korean porcelain or stoneware that we have now\r\ndescribed, and we may look in vain among the few ornamental _motifs_ to\r\nbe found on these wares for any marked divergency from Chinese types.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIAM AND THE INDO-CHINESE PENINSULA.\r\n\r\nUnder the somewhat vague heading of Indo-China we will collect a few\r\nnotes upon the specimens of porcelain that have been found in the\r\nvarious states into which the great peninsula that stretches south\r\nbetween the China Sea and the Bay of Bengal is divided.\r\n\r\nIn looking through the artistic productions of all these countries, we\r\nfind one marked characteristic; and that is the way in which Chinese\r\nforms and Chinese decorative _motifs_ have pushed their way in and in\r\npart replaced the old Buddhist and Brahmanistic styles.\r\n\r\nAs matters now stand, the most important for us of these states is Siam,\r\nfor here we are at once brought face to face with one of the places of\r\nmanufacture of the famous heavy celadon ware which in the Middle Ages\r\nwas carried by Arab and Chinese traders over all the seas of the then\r\nknown world. We shall have in a later chapter to come back to the\r\nquestion of this trade, and then we shall be able to show that the\r\ndiscussion as to the origin of this _martabani_ ware has been the means,\r\nas is indeed often the case in such disputes, of throwing much light on\r\nthe early history of Chinese porcelain.\r\n\r\nFor the present we are only concerned with an important discovery quite\r\nrecently made not far from the frontier of Siam and Pegu. Many specimens\r\nof celadon, some of the older type, have come in recent years from\r\nvarious parts of Indo-China. In the museum at Sèvres are some pieces of\r\nrough greyish ware, with a thick, irregularly crackled glaze, brought\r\nback in 1893 by the _Mission Fournereux_ from Siam and Cambodia; among\r\nthese fragments of old celadon we find a pair of contorted bowls, fused\r\ntogether in the kiln, in fact undoubted ‘wasters,’ such as could only be\r\nfound in the neighbourhood of the furnaces where they were fired. At the\r\ninstigation of Mr. C. H. Read of the British Museum, Mr. Lyle has lately\r\nexplored the remains of old potteries now hidden in deep jungle, at a\r\nplace called Sawankalok, not far from the western frontier of Siam.\r\nThese old kilns are situated some two hundred miles to the north of\r\nBangkok, and about the same distance from the port of Molmein (Malmen).\r\nTo show the importance of this discovery, we need only point out that\r\nnear to the latter town lies the old port of Martaban, which played so\r\nimportant a part in the mediæval trade of the Arabs, and from which,\r\ndoubtless, the name of Martabani, by which celadon ware has always been\r\nknown in the Mohammedan East, is derived. Among the many fragments\r\nbrought back by Mr. Lyle are some which from their distinct\r\ntranslucency, and from the whiteness and the conchoidal fracture of the\r\npaste, may be unhesitatingly classed as true porcelain. The colour of\r\nthe glaze varies from a prevailing greyish green to a fine turquoise\r\ntint in a few specimens. That the ware was made on the spot is proved\r\nby the presence of many defective pieces--‘wasters’ that had been thrown\r\naway--as well as by the numerous conical props (for the support of the\r\nware in the kiln) found mixed with the fragments. On these tall,\r\nnozzle-shaped props the plates and bowls were supported in an inverted\r\nposition. It is by this unusual method of support that we may account\r\nfor the fact that the glaze covers the _whole_ of the lower surface--so\r\nexceptional an occurrence in the case of porcelain--and at the same time\r\nfor the absence of the glaze from a ring-like portion of the upper\r\nsurface. We may note that a similar distribution of the glaze is found\r\noccasionally on large plates of the old heavy ware brought from other\r\ncountries; of this there are notable examples in the museum at Gotha\r\n(see p. 72). The ground in these Siamese specimens has assumed where\r\nexposed, but there only, the deep red so admired by the Chinese in the\r\nold Lung-chuan ware. The paste, in many of the examples, has been\r\nmoulded in low relief in the characteristic lotus-leaf pattern, while on\r\na few pieces there is a rough decoration in greenish black under the\r\nglaze. All remembrance of these old kilns has completely passed away,\r\nand at the present day the local market is supplied with a rough\r\nstoneware brought overland from Yunnan.[110]\r\n\r\nThe porcelain now found in Siam, of which many specimens have been\r\nlately brought to Europe, is of a very different character. This is the\r\nhighly decorated enamelled ware which may be classed with the _famille\r\nrose_ from the prevalence of the _rouge d’or_ among the enamels. This\r\nware, none of which can be earlier than the middle of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, is certainly made in China, but the presence in the decoration\r\nof\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PLATE XXII._ CHINESE]\r\n\r\ncertain peculiar Buddhist types makes it rather difficult to believe\r\nthat the enamelling was in all cases executed in Canton. It is true that\r\nin the colours, and in the general style of the decoration, we are often\r\nreminded of the well-known Cantonese enamels on copper. The white\r\nsurface of the ground is, for the most part, entirely hidden by a floral\r\ndecoration; but amid this, on medallions surrounded by tongues of flame,\r\nwe find centaur-like monsters with human heads, above which rise\r\nalmond-shaped _nimbi_. From the top of the cover of the hemispherical\r\nbowls--the commonest form--rises a knob in the shape of the Buddhist\r\njewel. The enamel of this ware appears to scale off readily, as if from\r\nimperfect firing. The prevailing colours are a deep red for the ground,\r\nand a bright green relieved with white and yellow for the design (PL.\r\nXXII.). While the finer specimens, as we have already said, remind us of\r\nthe Canton enamels, others suggest rather, in the scheme of colour and\r\ndecoration, the painted and lacquered bowls of India and Ceylon. In the\r\nIndian Museum at South Kensington may be seen an exceptionally fine\r\ncollection of this Sinico-Siamese porcelain, lent by Signor Cardu, and a\r\ngood opportunity is here provided for comparing its decoration with that\r\non the rough earthenware from Ceylon and various parts of India which is\r\nexhibited in adjacent cases.\r\n\r\nA coarse kind of porcelain is made in Annam. At Sèvres are some cups\r\npresented by the envoy from that kingdom. The rude pattern of bamboos\r\npainted in blue, _sous couverte_, on a greyish paste, does not give an\r\nexalted idea of Annamese civilisation.\r\n\r\nIn Japan we sometimes find specimens of a somewhat rough but\r\npicturesquely decorated ware, hardly a true porcelain, I think, which\r\nfrom the country of its origin is known as Kochi. From the nature and\r\ncolour of its glaze it may be compared to some of the old Chinese wares\r\nof the _demi grand feu_, and again, in certain points, to the earlier\r\ntypes of the Japanese porcelain of Kaga and Imari. Kochi has been\r\nidentified with Cochin-China, but as the geographical ideas of the\r\nJapanese as to foreign states were not very definite--derived as they\r\nwere from the Chinese geographers of the Ming period--we may perhaps be\r\njustified in looking further north for the source of this ware, either\r\nin Tonquin or in some part of Kuang-tung, the southernmost province of\r\nChina.[111]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nTHE PORCELAIN OF JAPAN\r\n\r\n\r\nIn any assemblage of the ceramic products of Japan, more especially in\r\none of native origin, it will be seen that porcelain no longer, as in\r\nChina, holds the place of honour. This place would be taken, in such a\r\ncollection, by a series of small bowls and jars mostly of a\r\ndark-coloured earthenware, which offer little to attract a European eye.\r\nOn the other hand, a Western collector of Japanese ceramics would be\r\nlikely to find more to interest him in the decorated fayence of which\r\nthe kilns of Kioto and Satsuma have furnished the most exquisite\r\nexamples. And yet, perhaps, in no country, not even in China, do we find\r\nporcelain, and that of a high technical quality, so largely employed for\r\ndomestic use. The commonest coolie eats his rice or drinks his tea or\r\n_saké_ from a bowl or cup of porcelain, while to find specimens of the\r\nold rough stoneware or earthenware we must explore the _Kura_--the\r\nfireproof storehouses of the rich noble or merchant--where, wrapped in\r\ncases of old brocade, these little objects are carefully preserved and\r\nclassified. It would be out of place here to enter into the causes,\r\npolitical, social, and, we may add, also psychological, that have\r\ninfluenced the Japanese mind in thus associating all that is refined and\r\nintellectual with a class of pottery in which, to say the least, the\r\nartistic possibilities are confined within very narrow limits. But, as\r\nis now well known, this tendency has been fostered by the ceremonies\r\nconnected with the social gatherings known as the _Cha-no-yu_ (literally\r\n‘hot water for tea‘), when the powdered tea is prepared in and drunk\r\nfrom examples of these primitive wares. On such occasions the criticism\r\nand measured praise of the utensils employed forms an important--indeed\r\nan almost obligatory--part of the conversation among the guests.\r\n\r\nThe merits of Chinese porcelain, however, have long been acknowledged by\r\nthe Japanese. Possibly as early as the ninth century specimens of\r\nceladon were imported. Direct communication with China has indeed since\r\nthat time been subject to many interruptions, and it has at all times\r\nbeen carried on subject to galling restrictions and heavy duties levied\r\nby the governments of both countries. The Japanese have at many times\r\nmade piratical descents upon the coast of China, and among the loot thus\r\nobtained many fine pieces of Chinese porcelain may have found their way\r\nto Japan. There was, however, a period in the fifteenth century during\r\nwhich a pretty steady trade was kept up, under the patronage of the\r\npleasure-loving Ashikaga Shoguns, and many specimens of the earlier Ming\r\nporcelain must have reached Japan at that time. It has always been the\r\nceladon ware that has found most favour with the Japanese, and fabulous\r\nprices were, and indeed still are, given for fine pieces. We may note\r\nthat such specimens are as a rule associated in the Japanese mind with\r\nthe Yuan or Mongol dynasty. Speaking generally, however, it was not to\r\nthis direct intercourse with China that the Japanese attribute their\r\nknowledge of ceramic processes. From an early date nearly all that they\r\nknew of the continental lands of Asia seems to have reached them from\r\nKorea, a country where they played alternately the part of ruthless\r\ninvaders and devastators, and of eager and submissive students.\r\n\r\nLet us then rapidly glance over the records preserved by the Japanese of\r\ntheir early lessons in the potter’s art, that we may better understand\r\nthe conditions under which the manufacture of porcelain was at length\r\nestablished in the country at the end of the sixteenth century.\r\n\r\nOf the early pottery of Japan--rude figures, coffins, and strange-shaped\r\nvases of coarse earthenware dating from the early centuries of our\r\nera--we know, thanks to the researches of Mr. Gowland, much more than we\r\ndo of the products of a similar stage of culture in China. In the\r\nBritish Museum we may see a collection, unique of its kind in Europe, of\r\nprehistoric objects, found most of them in or around the dolmen tombs of\r\nthe early emperors, and brought together in Japan by that energetic\r\nexplorer. As, according to Japanese tradition, Korean potters were in\r\nthose early days already settled in Japan, we need not be surprised to\r\nfind that vessels of very similar shape, but of a rather better ware,\r\nhave also been found in Korean tombs.\r\n\r\nThe earliest ware whose origin we can trace to a definite spot, is that\r\nformerly made at Karatsu, in Hizen, near to the great porcelain district\r\nof later days. Korean potters are traditionally reported to have been\r\nestablished here as far back as the early part of the seventh century.\r\nOf this primitive ware we will only note that the pieces were placed in\r\nthe kiln in an inverted position, either without supports (the\r\n_Kuchi-nashi-de_, or ‘unglazed orifice ware‘), or supported by two props\r\nof rectangular section (the _Geta okoshi_, or ‘clog supports‘). This is\r\na point of interest in connection with the similar devices used in\r\nfiring some of the early celadon. But, as Captain Brinkley points out\r\n(_The Chrysanthemum_, vol. iii. p. 18), it was the introduction of tea\r\nfrom China[112] early in the thirteenth century that gave rise, for the\r\nfirst time, to a demand for a better kind of pottery.\r\n\r\nKato Shirozayemon, a native of Owari, made, we are told, a five years’\r\nvisit to China about this time (he returned to his native village of\r\nSeto in 1223) in order to study the potter’s craft. The ware that he\r\nsucceeded in making on his return to Japan has a reddish brown paste\r\ncovered with a dark glaze, streaked and patched with lighter tints. This\r\nwas probably more or less an imitation of the Kien yao, the ‘hare-fur’\r\ncups made in the province of Fukien in late Sung times.[113] These cups,\r\nso prized by the Japanese, are of interest to us, as they may, in some\r\ndegree, be regarded as the ancestral type from which the long series of\r\nJapanese tea-bowls is derived. But neither the ware of Toshiro (he is\r\ngenerally known by this shortened form of his name), nor that of his\r\nfollowers, has any claim to be classed as porcelain. It is, however,\r\nfrom Seto, the native village of Toshiro, where he set up his kilns on\r\nhis return from China, that the commonest Japanese name for all kinds of\r\nceramic ware, but more especially for porcelain, is derived, and the\r\ndistrict is now a great centre for the production of blue and white\r\nporcelain.\r\n\r\nApart from this dark ware and from the heavy celadon, it would seem that\r\nat this time, and even later, the only true porcelain known to the\r\nJapanese was the white translucent ware of Korea, itself probably an\r\noffshoot of some early form of Ting ware. That Toshiro, who must have\r\ntravelled in Fukien barely two generations earlier than Marco Polo,\r\nshould only have learned to make this one kind of dark ware, shows how\r\nlocally circumscribed was the knowledge and use in China, in Sung times,\r\nof different kinds of porcelain.\r\n\r\nWe have to wait nearly three hundred years for the first attempts at the\r\nmanufacture of porcelain in Japan. Gorodayu Shonsui, the second great\r\nname in the history of Japanese ceramics, made his way to Fuchow early\r\nin the sixteenth century. He probably visited King-te-chen, and returned\r\nto Japan in the year 1513, bringing with him specimens of the materials\r\nused by the Chinese, both for the paste and for the glaze of their\r\nporcelain. But although Shonsui on his return settled at Arita, in the\r\ncentre of what was at a later time the principal porcelain district of\r\nJapan, he appears never to have discovered the precious deposits of\r\nkaolin in the neighbouring hills; for when the supplies brought from\r\nChina came to an end, he and his successors had to fall back upon the\r\nmanufacture of fayence. A few specimens of the ware he made have been\r\npreserved in Japan, and it has often been copied since Shonsui’s\r\ntime--even in China, it is said. It is a fair imitation of the Ming blue\r\nand white, and we may note that the plum-blossom often occurs in the\r\ndecoration. We are told that the secret of the process of _enamel\r\npainting_ was rigorously kept from Shonsui. We have seen that it is at\r\nleast doubtful whether this process was known to the Chinese at that\r\ntime, but the reference may be to the ware covered with polychrome\r\npainted glazes.\r\n\r\nThere are two pieces attributed to Shonsui, on native evidence, in the\r\nhistorical collection of Japanese pottery at South Kensington, but it is\r\nvery doubtful whether these very ordinary pieces of blue and white are\r\neven as old as the later date (1580-90) somewhat strangely attributed to\r\nthem on the same authority.\r\n\r\nAnd now the Korean potter is found again on the scene. It was reserved\r\nfor Risampei, a native of that country, to recognise for the first\r\ntime--in 1599, it is said--the value of the white crumbling rocks\r\nout-cropping on the hills that rise at the back of Arita. Here he built\r\nhis kilns and succeeded in making a fairly good imitation of the Chinese\r\nblue and white which was now becoming more and more in request as an\r\narticle of commerce.\r\n\r\nAt this stage we are brought into contact not only with the local\r\nhistory and the politics of the day, but with the great questions of\r\nworld traffic that were being fought out at the time. The rich western\r\nisland of Kiushiu had long been the principal seat of the efforts of the\r\nPortuguese and Spanish missionaries. They had nowhere more converts than\r\non the coasts of Hizen and on the adjacent islands. So that to one or\r\nmore of these early kilns established near Arita we may reasonably\r\nassign some at least of those strange plates, painted with Biblical\r\nsubjects, that have excited so much curiosity. I will only point to the\r\nlarge dish with an elaborate picture of the Baptism of Christ in the\r\ncentre, now at South Kensington (PL. XIV.). The subject is painted in\r\nblue under the glaze and heightened by gilding. Around the edge we find\r\na design of little naked boys--_amorini_, in fact--playing among\r\nflowers.[114]\r\n\r\nWe can find nothing in the Japanese records to throw light on the\r\nporcelain made in Hizen during the first half of the seventeenth\r\ncentury, but much of the somewhat roughly decorated blue and white ware\r\n(the larger dishes especially, made for India and Persia) has been\r\nclassed, on the ground of the occurrence of spur-marks, and of the\r\nnature of the paste and decoration, as Japanese.[115] Some of this ware\r\nmay be as old as this time, when (I mean shortly before the middle of\r\nthe seventeenth century) the demand from the West was ever increasing,\r\nand the Chinese supply was so uncertain and so inferior in quality.\r\n\r\nMeantime the Dutch and English factories on the island of Hirado,\r\nopposite to the pottery district of Imari, were finally closed (1641),\r\nand all communication with the outside world prohibited. The only\r\nexception made was in favour of the strictly limited commerce carried on\r\nthrough the Dutch and Chinese merchants, who were confined in their\r\nprison-like factories at Nagasaki.[116]\r\n\r\nNow it is a remarkable fact that our first definite information\r\nconcerning the introduction of Japanese porcelain into Europe dates from\r\nthis very period, and it is to approximately the same date that the\r\nJapanese ascribe the introduction of coloured enamels among the Hizen\r\npotters. One Higashidori Tokuzayemon, a potter of Imari, is said to have\r\nderived some knowledge of the precious secret from the captain of a\r\nChinese junk trading at Nagasaki in 1648. With the assistance of\r\nKakiyemon, a skilled potter of the same district, he succeeded in\r\nimitating the five-coloured enamelled wares of the Wan-li period.\r\nAnother Japanese authority[117] gives the name of his assistant as Gosu\r\nGombei, and states that by 1645, after many fruitless experiments, they\r\nwere able to produce a ware decorated with coloured enamels and with\r\ngold and silver, which was exported at first through the medium of a\r\nChinese merchant, and shortly after sold to the Dutch.\r\n\r\nSo far from Japanese sources. On the other hand, we hear of an early\r\nDutch ambassador sent from Batavia--‘_Le Sieur Wagenaar, grand\r\nconnoisseur et fort habile dans ces sortes d‘œuvres_‘--in fact himself a\r\ndesigner of patterns, one of which, it is said--white flowers on a blue\r\nground--found great favour at this time. In the same work[118] we are\r\ntold that this gentleman, who combined the most delicate diplomatic\r\nnegotiations with practical commercial undertakings, took back with him\r\nto Batavia more than twenty thousand pieces of _plain white ware_\r\n(1634-35). It is, however, very probable that the Dutch may have had a\r\ngreat deal to do with the introduction of coloured enamels into Japan.\r\n\r\nWe must remember that during this time (say between 1630 and 1650) two\r\nimportant series of events were coming to pass which revolutionised the\r\nEastern trade. These were, first, in China the troubles attending the\r\nexpulsion of the Ming dynasty, including the burning of King-te-chen and\r\nthe stoppage of the supply of porcelain for shipping at Canton; and\r\nsecondly, the final triumph of the anti-Christian party in Japan, and\r\nthe closing of the country to foreigners. It is no wonder, then, if the\r\nDutch ambassador was empowered to offer almost any terms to the\r\nJapanese, provided that the latter would only make an exception in\r\nfavour of the merchants of his country.\r\n\r\nTurning now from the records of the Japanese and of the Dutch merchants,\r\nlet us examine the specimens of Japanese porcelain that we find in our\r\noldest European collections, and which we may reasonably assign to the\r\nseventeenth century. Apart from the blue and white, we find here two\r\nclasses of enamelled ware which we now know to be of Japanese origin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PLATE XXIII._ JAPANESE, KAKIYEMON ENAMELLED WARE]\r\n\r\nIt may indeed be said that it was in the separation, and in the definite\r\nattribution to Japan, of these two groups, that the first step was made\r\ntowards a scientific classification of Oriental porcelain, and for this\r\nwork we are chiefly indebted to the labours of the late Sir A. W.\r\nFranks. We will first deal with what may on the whole be regarded as the\r\noldest group.\r\n\r\nKAKIYEMON WARE.--Under this name it will be convenient to describe the\r\ncompact group of decorated porcelain that we find taking so prominent a\r\nplace in our old collections. Of this ware there is a most\r\nrepresentative series of specimens in the British Museum. There are also\r\nmany interesting pieces scattered through the rooms of Hampton Court.\r\nThe chief characteristics of this Kakiyemon ware are the creamy-white\r\npaste, without the bluish tinge so common in other Japanese porcelain,\r\nthe moulded forms (in the case of the small vases and of the dishes with\r\nscalloped edges), and above all the peculiar nature of the decoration\r\nthat is somewhat sparely scattered over the ground. Here we find the\r\nwell-known combination of the pine, the bamboo, and the plum (Japanese\r\n_Sho-chiku-bai_) associated with quaintly executed figures in old\r\nChinese costume. In the foreground is often found a curious hedge or\r\ntrellis-fence of straw or rushes, and at times, at the side, a grotesque\r\ntiger is seen disporting in strange attitudes (PL. XXIII.). Exotic\r\nbirds, singularly ill-drawn, are sometimes seen, but individual flowers\r\nare introduced with great decorative feeling--witness the sprig of\r\npoppy, a rare flower in Japanese art, on a plate in the British Museum.\r\nThere is a non-Japanese element in the design which seems to hamper the\r\nnative artist, but whether this element is to be sought in Holland or in\r\nKorea--or perhaps in a degree in both--is quite uncertain.[119] As for\r\nthe enamel colours employed, the most important point is the use of a\r\nblue enamel _over the glaze_. This colour is freely employed in\r\ncombination with the usual opaque red. The other colours, more sparingly\r\nused, are a green of emerald tint, a pale yellow, and a poorish purple.\r\nThe full command of a fine-coloured blue enamel at so early a date is\r\ninteresting. In the earlier Chinese examples this colour is poor, and\r\nthe enamel is apt to chip off. On a few rare pieces of this Kakiyemon\r\nporcelain we see the blue applied under the glaze, and there is one\r\nspecimen in the British Museum on which the two methods are combined. We\r\nrarely come upon specimens of this ware in Japan. In China, at one time,\r\nit was copied for exportation, and Dr. Bushell thinks that the porcelain\r\nclassed as _Tung-yang-tsai_ or ‘Japanese colours,’ in the time of\r\nKang-he, is of this class. A large octagonal jar at South Kensington,\r\nsomewhat crudely decorated in the Kakiyemon style, which came from\r\nPersia, may possibly be of Chinese origin. There is, at any rate, no\r\ndoubt that this is the ware known, perhaps two hundred years ago, in\r\nFrance as the _première qualité colorée_, and in England and Germany as\r\n‘old East Indian,’ It was reserved for Jacquemart to class it as Korean.\r\nIt is, however, remarkable that in neither the Japanese nor the Dutch\r\nrecords of the time do we find any notice of a decoration at all\r\nresembling that found on this ware. Any hint that is given from these\r\nsources would apply much better to the class of porcelain that we have\r\nnext to describe. In later chapters we shall see that the important\r\nposition given to this Kakiyemon porcelain by our ancestors is reflected\r\nin the decoration applied to more than one of the early wares of Europe.\r\n\r\nIMARI OR OLD JAPAN.--The many kilns that sprung up in the province of\r\nHizen during the\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PLATE XXIV._ 1. CHINESE. 2. JAPANESE.]\r\n\r\ncourse of the seventeenth century, along the slope of the hills that\r\nproduced both the china-stone and the china-clay, were chiefly occupied\r\nin making blue and white porcelain, the _sometsuke_ or ‘dyed’ ware of\r\nthe Japanese, and this, we may add, is still the case.\r\n\r\nThe underglaze blue indeed has always remained the dominant element in\r\nthe Imari porcelain, and to judge by the older pieces the employment of\r\nother colours crept in gradually. This blue is generally of a peculiar\r\ndark lavender or slaty tint, and with the addition to it of a little\r\ngilding we obtain already the general effect of the ‘old Japan’\r\ndecoration. When to the blue and gold was added an opaque iron-red (from\r\nthis pigment the Japanese succeeded in obtaining a great variety of fine\r\ntints), we attain to a scheme of decoration which, at first sight, gives\r\nthe impression of being built up with a full palette of colours; this is\r\nthe typical _nishiki-de_ or ‘brocaded’ ware of the Japanese (PL. I.).\r\nIndeed in many of the finest specimens we find nothing beyond these\r\nthree colours--blue, red, and gold. But the blue, derived from the\r\nnative ore, the concretionary ‘wad,’ containing generally more manganese\r\nthan cobalt, is often wholly or in part replaced as the dominant colour\r\nby a glossy black painted over the glaze, and this, too, in specimens\r\nwith some claims to antiquity. The other colours of the Chinese\r\n‘pentad,’ the green, the yellow, and the purple, generally occupy quite\r\nsubordinate positions. It is to be noted that in this ware we never find\r\nthe blue applied as an enamel _over_ the glaze.\r\n\r\nIt would be a mistake to regard the whole series of Imari enamelled\r\nporcelain as made only for exportation. It is true that the large vases\r\nand plates with the well-known effective but somewhat overloaded\r\ndecoration are not found in Japan, although such pieces have been made\r\nat Arita for the last two hundred years for exportation from Nagasaki;\r\nbut the more quietly decorated ware of Imari, in endless forms and with\r\ndecoration of the most varied kind, has long been in general domestic\r\nuse, and many smaller pieces of great artistic beauty have been lately\r\nobtained from Japanese collections.[120]\r\n\r\nIn fact, the early enamelled wares of Imari are recognised by the\r\nJapanese as the _fons et origo_ of most of the decorated porcelain, to\r\nsay nothing of the later pottery, of their country. We have seen how our\r\n‘old Japan’ group started from a slight modification of the blue and\r\nwhite, but we must find place also for an early ware decorated in five\r\ncolours, somewhat in the Wan-li style. Of this ware but few pieces\r\nsurvive. The tradition, however, was carried on at Kutani and at many of\r\nthe Kioto kilns in the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\nLate in the seventeenth century the Kizayemon family obtained the\r\nprivilege of supplying the porcelain, decorated with cranes and\r\nchrysanthemums, for the personal use of the Mikado, and at the present\r\nday a member of this family is said to still claim the right of\r\npurveying to the imperial court. It is to one of these Kizayemons, but\r\nnot until the year 1770, that the merit of the invention of seggars for\r\nholding the porcelain in the kiln is given by the Japanese. It would\r\nseem that before that date no such protection was given. That such a\r\nclaim should be made shows how completely Japan at this time was shut\r\nout from the rest of the world.\r\n\r\nAnd here we may point out how self-contained was the development of\r\nJapanese porcelain during the palmy days of the Tokugawa _régime_ (say\r\nfrom 1650 to 1850). As in the case of the kindred arts of metalware and\r\nlacquer, any European influence was quite of a casual and what we may\r\ncall fanciful nature; while the new methods of decoration that came into\r\nuse in\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate XXV.\r\n\r\n_Japanese. Imari ware._]\r\n\r\nChina in the eighteenth century were never recognised or copied, even if\r\nthey were known. What imitation there was of China was confined to the\r\ncopying of Ming types; the Manchus, in fact, were never acknowledged by\r\nthe Japanese, and their arts were under a taboo almost as strict as that\r\napplied to the civilisation of the West. No better instance of this\r\nconservatism could be given than the fact that the use of gold as a\r\nsource of a red pigment, the basis of the _famille rose_ in China,\r\nappears to have been unknown until the beginning of the nineteenth\r\ncentury, and even then the _rouge-d’or_ was but sparingly applied. On\r\nthe other hand, the Chinese were always eager, in the interest of trade,\r\nto copy the wares exported from Nagasaki, and we shall see later on what\r\nan influence the various products of the Hizen kilns had upon the\r\nporcelain of Europe.\r\n\r\nThese, then, were practically the only kinds of Japanese ceramic ware\r\nknown in Europe until the opening of the country in our days--the blue\r\nand white or _sometsuke_, the ‘old Japan’ or _nishiki-de_, and the\r\npeculiar type which we have classed as Kakiyemon. To this list we should\r\nperhaps add the plain white ware, much of which was subsequently\r\ndecorated in Europe.\r\n\r\nThese wares were all of them made in the kilns near Arita, nor do they\r\nexhaust the products of even that district. But during the eighteenth\r\ncentury the manufacture of porcelain spread to other parts of Japan\r\nwhere porcelain was made exclusively for home consumption. Many of these\r\nkilns were established under princely patronage, some in the very\r\ngardens of the feudal lord, while a special interest is given to others\r\nby their association with certain skilled potters and their descendants,\r\nwhose names, in opposition to what we found was the practice in China,\r\nwe can thus connect with the wares.\r\n\r\nBut we will first say something about the composition and the processes\r\nof manufacture of the porcelain of Japan, dwelling, however, only on\r\nthose few points where we find divergences from the practices obtaining\r\nin China.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, then, as to the composition of the paste. To judge\r\nfrom the few trustworthy analyses of Imari ware that have been made, the\r\npaste would seem to be of a very abnormal type; the amount of silica--70\r\nto 74 per cent.--is quite unusual; there is an almost total absence of\r\nlime, so important a constituent of Chinese porcelain; while we find\r\nfrom 4 to 5 per cent. of the alkalis. But, in place of the potash found\r\nin the wares of China, in the Japanese paste the prevailing alkali is\r\ninvariably soda.\r\n\r\nThe materials of the porcelain made in Hizen were obtained originally\r\nfrom the famous ‘Hill of Springs‘--Idzumi Yama--which rises behind the\r\ntown of Arita. Of late years, however, large quantities of clay and\r\nstone have been brought from the island of Amakusa, which lies to the\r\nsouth. It is from the products of decomposition of a volcanic rock, a\r\nkind of quartz-trachyte, that these materials are obtained, not from a\r\ntrue granitic rock as in Owari[121] and in most other seats of porcelain\r\nmanufacture all over the world.[122]\r\n\r\nIn the neighbourhood of Arita the raw materials lie conveniently at\r\nhand; and in the Japanese accounts there is no definite reference to two\r\ndistinct elements in the constitution of the paste. However, that\r\nsomething corresponding to our china-stone is made use of, is shown by\r\nthe importance attached to the methods by which the stone is reduced to\r\npowder. The primitive stamping-mill, worked by a long lever of wood,\r\nmoved either by the foot of a coolie or by a simple hydraulic\r\narrangement, has long been employed for pounding the stone, and the\r\nhills around Arita re-echo with the thuds of these mills.\r\n\r\nThe potter’s wheel plays here a larger part than in China, and the\r\nJapanese are exceptionally skilful throwers. Still, notwithstanding some\r\nnative statements to the contrary, the use of moulds either of wood or\r\nof terra-cotta has long been known--witness the old Kakiyemon porcelain.\r\n\r\nWe now come to the most important departure from the Chinese procedure.\r\nIn Japan, the ware (as is, indeed, universally the case in Europe)\r\nreceives a preliminary baking in a specially constructed biscuit kiln\r\nbefore the application of the glaze. The adoption of this practice would\r\nseem to point to a greater tenderness in the raw clay.\r\n\r\nThe glaze (Japanese _kusuri_--‘medicine‘) is prepared by mixing the\r\nfinely powdered china-stone with the ashes of certain kinds of wood. The\r\nashes from the bark of the usu-tree (_Distylium racemosum_) are\r\nespecially in request for this purpose, and it is certainly remarkable\r\nthat these ashes contain nearly 40 per cent. of lime, the element that\r\nis conspicuous by its absence from the paste.\r\n\r\nThe furnaces in which the principal firing takes place are of a bee-hive\r\nshape: they are arranged in rows of from five to ten hearths placed by\r\npreference on the slope of a hill, so that each succeeding hearth rises\r\ntwo or three feet above its neighbour. This plan is probably a\r\nmodification of the old Ming type of furnace, and the system, it is\r\nsaid, was introduced from Korea.\r\n\r\nThe use of seggars appears never to have become general, and this is\r\nprobably the reason why the marks of ‘crow’s-feet’ and other kinds of\r\nstruts, used to support the vessel in the kiln, are often conspicuous\r\non the base of the larger pieces.\r\n\r\nNeither in their glazes nor for their enamels have the Japanese ever\r\nmade use of any colours unknown to the Chinese, nor until quite recent\r\ntimes have they paid much attention to single glazes. There is, however,\r\none important exception to this last statement, in the _Sei-ji_ or\r\nceladon ware, which with them has always been the ideal of classical\r\nperfection, and which they have imitated with varied success. For their\r\nreds they have always been confined to pigments derived from iron, but\r\nwith these opaque intractable materials they have obtained a great\r\nvariety of effects, especially by means of delicate gradations of\r\nstrength. In the case of the blue under the glaze, the Japanese have\r\nnever attained to the mastery of their teachers: there is very commonly\r\na tendency of the colour to run, and a bluish tint is thereby given to\r\nthe white ground; the blue, moreover, on the older specimens, is\r\ngenerally dull, and in modern times often crude and unpleasant.\r\n\r\nThe shapes and uses of Japanese porcelain start, for the most part, from\r\nChinese models of Ming times, but there are a few forms that are not\r\nfound in China. The _hi-bachi_ or fire-bowl, though more commonly of\r\nbronze, we sometimes find made of celadon or of blue and white\r\nporcelain; the _kôrô_ or incense-burner, with a cover of pierced metal,\r\nis a form characteristic of Japan; and the more elaborate _choshi-buro_\r\nor ‘clove-bath’ is, I think, peculiar to the country; so, too, are both\r\nthe _saké_-bottle of cylindrical or square section, with a curved lip\r\nfor pouring, and the little cups, in sets of three, often of egg-shell\r\nware, from which the _saké_ is drunk. The use of the miniature teapot,\r\nin which the better sort of tea is infused, is again confined to Japan;\r\nbut these little _kibisho_, unlike the vessels for powdered tea used in\r\nthe _Cha-no-yu_, have not, I think, been long in fashion.\r\n\r\nWe have described the three kinds of porcelain made in Hizen for\r\nexportation to Europe, and we have seen that by the middle of the\r\nseventeenth century this commerce, in the hands of the Dutch, and to\r\nsome extent of the Chinese, had already attained large proportions.\r\nBefore turning to the kilns that sprung up in other parts of Japan\r\nduring the eighteenth century--of these the origin in every case can be\r\ntraced back directly or indirectly to the early Hizen factories--we must\r\nsay a word about some other varieties of porcelain made in the same\r\nneighbourhood, but not destined for foreign use.\r\n\r\nThe village or town of Arita, of which the better-known Imari is the\r\nport, lies about fifty miles to the north-east of Nagasaki, and it may\r\nalmost be regarded as the King-te-chen of Japan. The clay and\r\nchina-stone used there is now brought, for the most part, from the\r\nadjacent islands, from Hirado, from Amakusa, and even from the more\r\nremote Goto islands. By a combination of some of the most important\r\npotters of the district, and with the assistance of some wealthy\r\nmerchants, a company, the _Koransha_, was formed some twenty-five years\r\nago,[123] and an attempt was made to keep up the quality of the\r\nporcelain produced, at least from a technical point of view. It was\r\ncertainly time for some such effort to be made, for about that period,\r\njust after the Philadelphia Exhibition, the arts of Japan reached\r\nperhaps their nadir.\r\n\r\nMIKÔCHI OR HIRADO WARE.--It was with a somewhat similar object that,\r\nlong before this--about the middle of the eighteenth century--the feudal\r\nlord of Hirado had taken some of the kilns near Arita under his\r\npatronage, and had also attempted to regulate the wasteful and careless\r\nway in which the materials were quarried on the slopes of Idzumi Yama.\r\nThis was the origin of the beautiful Mikôchi (_Mi-ka-uchi_) ware, which\r\nwas at first produced only for the use of the prince and of his friends,\r\nor for presentation to the Shogun.\r\n\r\nTo understand the important influence of this aristocratic patronage\r\nupon the scattered kilns of Japan (only a few of these, indeed, produced\r\nporcelain), I cannot do better than quote the words of Captain Brinkley,\r\nperhaps our first authority on Japanese ceramics: ‘During the two\r\ncenturies that represent the golden age of Japanese ceramic art, that is\r\nto say, from 1645 to 1845, every factory of any importance was under the\r\ndirect patronage either of the nobleman in whose fief it lay, or of some\r\nwealthy amateur whose whole business in life was comprised in the\r\ncultivation of the _Cha-no-yu_. The wares produced, if they did not\r\nrepresent the independent efforts of artists seeking to achieve or\r\nmaintain celebrity, were undertaken in compliance with the orders of the\r\nworkman’s liege lord, or of some other exalted personage. Considerations\r\nof cost were entirely set aside, no expenditure of time and toil were\r\ndeemed excessive, and the slightest blemish sufficed to secure the\r\ncondemnation of the piece.’ All these conditions were swept away by the\r\nrevolution of 1868 and by the opening of the country to foreigners.\r\n‘Codes of subtle æsthetics and criticisms of exacting amateurs had no\r\nlonger to be considered, but in their stead the artist found himself\r\nconfronted by the Western market with all its elements of sordid haste\r\nand superficial judgment.’\r\n\r\nTo return to the Mikôchi porcelain, this Hirado ware, for it was known\r\nalso by that name, produced at the prince’s kilns, six miles to the\r\nsouth of Arita, was for more than a hundred years regarded as the _ne\r\nplus ultra_ among Japanese porcelain, and its value was enhanced by the\r\nfact that the ware never found its way into commerce. In the _sous\r\ncouverte_ blue it was sought to imitate the paler type of the old Ming\r\nware. The best-known examples of this blue decoration are seen on the\r\nlittle cups delicately painted with Chinese boys at play under\r\npine-trees--the more the boys the better the ware, it is said. Careful\r\nmanipulation of the clay and finish of surface has never been carried to\r\na higher point than in the varieties of this porcelain worked with\r\npierced patterns and ornaments in relief, so prized by Japanese\r\ncollectors. On these we find, in addition to the blue, a peculiar tint\r\nof pale brown. Of this coloured ware there are some good specimens at\r\nSouth Kensington.\r\n\r\nÔKÔCHI OR NABESHIMA WARE.--The same high technical finish has been\r\nattained in the Ôkôchi porcelain made at the village of that name\r\n(_Ô-kawa-uchi_) three miles to the north of Arita. The kilns here were\r\npatronised by the Nabeshima princes, who belonged to one of the greatest\r\nfeudal families of old Japan. In this case also, the small highly\r\nfinished pieces were destined for presents only and were never sold.\r\nThis ware is generally to be identified by the comb-like pattern\r\n(Japanese _Kushi-ki_), painted in blue round the base of the cups and\r\nbowls.[124] Like the little Chinese boys of the Mikôchi ware, this\r\npattern is often seen on very inferior ware of quite modern manufacture.\r\nA peculiar kind of finely crackled celadon was also made at Ôkôchi.\r\n\r\nIn the Arita district are many other factories, some of which, as those\r\nat Matsugawa, have at times produced excellent ware. Of most of these\r\nprivate kilns, however, the chief outturn has always been confined to\r\nthe blue and white _sometsuke_ for domestic use.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe have now to follow the steps by which the knowledge of porcelain was\r\ncarried from the western island to other parts of Japan. We had better\r\npass at once to the Kioto kilns, for although the manufacture of\r\nporcelain was not introduced at the old capital so early as at some\r\nother places in the main island, yet the skill of its artist potters and\r\ntheir connection with the imperial court led, in the course of the\r\neighteenth century, to the spread of their influence in every direction.\r\n\r\nKioto was already in the sixteenth century the seat of more than one\r\nceramic industry, but it was not so much the problem of the materials\r\nfor a true porcelain, as the questions connected with the coloured\r\nenamels lately brought over from the West, that excited the curiosity of\r\nthe Kioto potter at this time. The story goes that one Aoyama Koyemon (I\r\nquote again from _The Chrysanthemum_, April 1883), who came to Kioto\r\nfrom the porcelain district of Hizen, to obtain orders for the new\r\nenamelled ware, allowed the secret of its manufacture to be wormed out\r\nof him by a crafty Kioto dealer, and that for this breach of trust the\r\nwretched ‘traveller’ was crucified by his liege lord on his return to\r\nArita. This occurred just before the death of the great ceramic artist\r\nNinsei (about 1660), and the old potter at once obtained the knowledge\r\nof the new enamelling process from the above-mentioned crockery\r\nmerchant. This man, we should add--the dealer--is said to have gone mad\r\nwhen he heard the dreadful fate of his friend Koyemon--a fate for which\r\nhe was in so large a measure responsible. Such stories as this, and\r\nthere are other similar ones in the annals of Japanese ceramics, call to\r\nmind the adventures of the experts of the eighteenth century, who\r\ntrafficked with the German princes in the _arcana_ of the newly\r\nintroduced porcelain, but for these German experts the penalties for\r\nbreach of confidence were not of so severe a nature.\r\n\r\nNomomura Ninsei is generally held to be the greatest ceramic artist that\r\nJapan has produced. The decorated stoneware and pottery that he turned\r\nout late in life may be regarded as the common source from which the\r\nwares produced in the two main groups of kilns in the neighbourhood of\r\nKioto took their origin. With one of these groups, with the wares\r\nproduced in the factories around Awata, we are not concerned here, for\r\nno porcelain was ever produced in that suburb of Kioto. But to the other\r\ngroup of kilns, called after the beautiful temple of Kiyomidzu, to the\r\nnorth of Kioto, belong some of the most artistic specimens of porcelain\r\nin our collections. It was here that this somewhat uncongenial material\r\nwas forced for the first time to adapt itself to the fanciful genius of\r\nthe people. It was to this district that the great original artist\r\nKenzan, the brother of the still more famous Ogata Korin, came towards\r\nthe end of the seventeenth century. It is true that little of this\r\nartist’s work is executed in a true porcelain, but his picturesque\r\nsignature, scrawled in black, is sometimes found on the so-called more\r\nnoble ware (PL. B. 21). Like his brother Korin, Kenzan obtained his\r\neffects by the simplest means, sometimes by mere patches of colour\r\ncunningly distributed over the surface. The work of both these men has\r\nof late found many admirers and imitators in France.\r\n\r\nIt was not till the beginning of the eighteenth century that we have any\r\ndefinite record of the manufacture of porcelain in Kioto. About that\r\ntime Yeisen devoted himself to the imitation of Chinese celadon. If we\r\nare to find any common note in the wares produced in the various Kioto\r\npotteries, it would be in a certain studied rudeness both in shape and\r\ndecoration, the very opposite of the delicately finished products of the\r\nHizen kilns. The rare pieces of Ming porcelain with coloured decoration\r\nwere eagerly sought for and copied, not in a slavish way, but rather so\r\nas to catch the spirit of their design. In fact these Japanese copies\r\nmight be made to throw some light on that rather obscure subject, the\r\norigin of enamel decoration in China in the days of the later Ming\r\nemperors.\r\n\r\nAn apparently early class of Chinese enamelled ware, somewhat rudely\r\npainted with a predominant iron red combined with a subordinate green,\r\nwas a great favourite with the Kioto potters, but we find also copies of\r\nthe Wan-li ‘pentad,’ the designs in this case sparely scattered over the\r\nground, generally in formal patterns of a textile type. The blue and\r\npurple ware with ribbed _cloisons_ which the Japanese associate with\r\ntheir mysterious land of Kochi was also in favour, but at Kioto, I\r\nthink, this ware was not copied in porcelain. So of the blue and white\r\nmade at this time at Kiyomidzu, it is distinguished from both the Hizen\r\nand the Seto wares by a certain rudeness in the shape and decoration, a\r\ncharacter preserved by a great deal of the _sometsuke_ still made in\r\nthis district.\r\n\r\nQuite a different spirit was, however, brought in by Zengoro Riyozen,\r\nthe tenth descendant of a famous family of potters. This Zengoro was a\r\npotter of universal genius, the foremost ceramic artist indeed of the\r\npeaceful and luxurious period at the beginning of the nineteenth\r\ncentury, when the Tokugawa Shogun at Tokiyo set an example of an\r\nextravagant expenditure and brilliant display which was only too readily\r\nfollowed at the courts of the great feudal nobles. In the art work of\r\nthat time, in spite of the unsurpassed perfection of execution and love\r\nof gorgeous decoration, we can already trace the signs of a coming\r\ndecay. Zengoro, besides reviving with some success the deep sapphire\r\nblue, _sous couverte_, of Ming times, succeeded in producing from an\r\niron-oxide a red ground which vied with the famous coral reds of the\r\nprevious century in China. But it was rather the Ming red, _sous\r\ncouverte_, that made from ‘powdered rubies of the West,’ that he\r\nprofessed to copy. Over the red ground of his plates and little bowls he\r\npainted his design in gold of the finest quality, and on the white\r\nground of the inside placed a scant decoration of his under-glaze\r\nsapphire blue. Some of these dainty little cups are shown in a\r\ntable-case in the British Museum, but if we compare them with the\r\nexquisite Ming bowls of a deep red derived from copper in the same\r\ncollection, the difference of the quality of the two tints is at once\r\napparent. As, however, it was a matter of _convenance_ to go back to a\r\nMing model, it was with the latter ware that Zengoro’s work was\r\ncompared. It was for his success in this kind of decoration (produced\r\nabout the years 1806-1817) that the great Kioto potter received from his\r\npatron, the prince of Kishiu, a seal with the character _yeiraku_, or\r\nreading in modern Chinese _Yung-lo_, the name of the Ming emperor\r\n(1402-24) with whom the red copper glaze is traditionally associated\r\n(PL. B. 22).[125] This, then, is the origin of the name _Yeiraku\r\nkinrande_ for the ‘gold brocade’ ware of Zengoro. At a later time this\r\nform of decoration was carried by Zengoro’s son to Kaga, where in a\r\ndebased form it became characteristic of a ware with which our markets\r\nwere at one time flooded.\r\n\r\nKISHIU WARE.--This _kinrande_, however, is not the only kind of\r\nporcelain with which the name of this protean artist is associated.\r\nAlthough the name Yeiraku given him by the Prince Nariyuki is generally\r\nconnected with his brilliant red and gold ware, it was a porcelain of\r\nquite another kind that our Zengoro the tenth, or perhaps his son Hozen,\r\nthe eleventh of the family, turned out from the kilns that had been\r\nerected by that prince in the garden (the _Ô-niwa_) of his palace near\r\nWakayama. The Japanese tell us that this well-known Ô-niwa or Kishiu\r\nware was made in imitation of a kind of porcelain or fayence brought\r\nlong ago from Kochi, a name generally rendered as Cochin-China, in any\r\ncase a country to the south of China. We have seen grounds for\r\nassociating this _Ô-niwa yaki_ rather with an early type of Chinese\r\npolychrome ware, painted on the biscuit with glazes of three or perhaps\r\nfour colours. In any case, in the Japanese ware the turquoise, the\r\npurple, and the straw-coloured yellow (this last quite subordinate) are\r\napplied in a similar fashion, and this is indeed practically the only\r\nJapanese ware on which we find the turquoise colour that has played so\r\nimportant a part in other countries. It is here the most important\r\ncolour of the triad, but occasionally we find it replaced by a deep,\r\nrich green. On this Kishiu or Ô-niwa ware, known also to the Japanese as\r\n_Kairaku_ from another seal used by Zengoro (PL. B. 20), the decoration\r\nis formed by ribs or lines which separate the surface into shallow\r\n_cloisons_. In other cases the turquoise or the aubergine purple is\r\nfound alone as a monochrome glaze.\r\n\r\nVery few, however, of the large vases of this ware that have been\r\nexported of late years to Europe, and especially to America (where the\r\nturquoise blue has always been a favourite, as in the case of Chinese\r\nporcelain), can have come from the kilns in the ‘prince’s garden.’ This\r\nware has, indeed, for some time since, been imitated at many other\r\nplaces--at Tokiyo, and since 1870 especially at Kobe, where vast\r\nquantities have been manufactured for exportation. These copies have\r\ngone through the stages of degradation in design and colour that usually\r\naccompany a large commercial production.\r\n\r\nAnother famous potter, Mokubei, who worked at Kioto about the same time,\r\nis said to have made great improvements in the moulds employed by him,\r\nespecially in those used for copying old Chinese pieces. But we\r\ncertainly cannot accept the statement that he was the first potter in\r\nJapan to use moulds. This same Mokubei is said to have copied the richly\r\nglazed stoneware of Kochi, a ware that had long been prized by the\r\nJapanese, and to which, or rather to the kindred porcelain, we have\r\nalready referred. It is described as a hard pottery, with archaic\r\nmoulded decorations, coated with lustrous glazes of green, purple,\r\nyellow, and golden-bronze. Mokubei also worked for the prince of Kishiu,\r\nand it would be interesting to know what relation, if any, he had with\r\nZengoro and his Ô-niwa yaki.[126]\r\n\r\nSANDA CELADON.--The kilns set up at Sanda, a small town to the\r\nnorth-west of Osaka, by the feudal lord of the district, have acquired\r\nin Japan a great name on account of the celadon ware there made. This\r\n_Sanda-seiji_ was first produced at the end of the seventeenth century,\r\nand followed more closely the famous old heavy wares of Lung-chuan than\r\ndid the more delicately finished celadon porcelain made about the same\r\ntime at Ôkôchi in Hizen. In addition to these wares, the Japanese lay\r\nclaim to an ancient celadon of native manufacture, and much ink has been\r\nspilt in Japan upon the question of the origin of certain archaic pieces\r\npreserved in temples and private collections. The bulk of the Sanda\r\nceladon, we should say, is a solid useful ware with small artistic\r\npretensions.\r\n\r\nTHE WARES OF OWARI AND MINO.--If, leaving Kioto, we take the old\r\nhigh-road to Yedo--the Tokaido--we pass through a succession of villages\r\nwhere the local wares are displayed in the stalls lining the route. Some\r\nof this pottery is not without merit, and historical associations give\r\ninterest to more than one variety. But it is not till we have passed\r\nNagoya, a large industrial town at the head of the Gulf of Owari, that\r\nwe enter a true porcelain district--the only district in Japan that has\r\nvied with Hizen in the production of porcelain for domestic use and for\r\nexportation. Not far off is the village of Seto, the home of Toshiro; it\r\nwas here that on his return from China, early in the thirteenth century,\r\nhe set up the first kiln that produced in Japan a ware with any claims\r\nto artistic merit. But, as we have said at the beginning of this\r\nchapter, the ware made by Toshiro was no true porcelain, although the\r\nexpression _Seto-mono_, derived from his native village, is used rather\r\nfor porcelain than for other kinds of pottery. The term is, in fact,\r\nabout equivalent to our word ‘china.’\r\n\r\nIt was not till nearly six hundred years after Toshiro’s day that the\r\nvillage of Seto again became prominent, when in the year 1807 the art of\r\nmaking porcelain was, after many difficulties, successfully introduced\r\nfrom Hizen. This was thanks to the energy of the potter Tamakichi, who\r\nventured a journey to Hizen to find out the secrets of the manufacture.\r\nAs a reward for his services the privilege of wearing two swords and the\r\nrights of a _samurai_ were granted to Tamakichi by the lord of Owari.\r\nHere again we find the new industry established under the fostering care\r\nof the local prince.\r\n\r\nOver a wide district, more especially to the east on the borders of the\r\nprovince of Mikawa, the decomposing granite furnishes an excellent raw\r\nmaterial, and centres for the manufacture of porcelain have sprung up\r\nsporadically over a tract stretching away to the north, as far as the\r\nprovince of Mino. But most of these kilns have never produced anything\r\nbetter than a common blue and white ware.\r\n\r\nIn composition the paste of the Owari porcelain is much closer to the\r\nnormal type than that of the Hizen wares (see note, p. 190). Of late\r\nyears the Owari potters have succeeded in turning out pieces of\r\nunprecedented size, in the shape especially of dishes and of slabs for\r\nthe tops of tables. From the artistic side, however, little can be said\r\nin favour of this ware: the blue is generally crude in quality, often\r\nresembling that found on the commoner European porcelain of later days.\r\n\r\nAnother art was revived some years ago in the neighbourhood of Nagoya,\r\nthe chief town of this district--I mean that of enamelling in metallic\r\n_cloisons_ (the _Shipô_, or ‘seven treasures’ of the Japanese), and of\r\nlate years the two industries have been combined by applying the\r\nmetallic _cloisons_ and the enamel to the surface of porcelain. A\r\nsimilar ware has also been made at Kioto, but in this case the soft\r\nfayence of Awata has been used as a base. Enormous quantities of both\r\nthese varieties of _cloisonné_ have been brought to Europe, and when we\r\nconsider the amount of skilled labour required in the manufacture, we\r\ncan only marvel at the prices for which this ware is retailed in London.\r\n\r\nMuch of the cheap Japanese blue and white sold in Europe comes from this\r\nOwari district, but of late years more ambitious things have been\r\nattempted there--monochrome glazes of the _grand feu_, including a\r\ncurious variety of _flambé_ ware with a chocolate-coloured ground.\r\n\r\nKUTANI WARE.--There only remains one important centre of porcelain\r\nmanufacture for us to describe. This lies far away among the mountains\r\nthat skirt the western coast of Japan. The feudal lords of that country,\r\nhowever, the princes of Kaga, were reputed to be the most wealthy of all\r\nthe daimios of Japan. A junior branch of this family, the lords of\r\nDaichoji, as early as the first half of the seventeenth century\r\nestablished a kiln at the mountain village of Kutani. In the year 1660\r\nan emissary was despatched to Hizen to spy out the land and learn what\r\nhe could of the new processes lately introduced there. The story of his\r\ndifficulties is only another version of that told of Tamakichi, the\r\nSeto potter. After many adventures, abandoning the wife that he had been\r\nforced to marry at Arita and the child he had had by her, he returned to\r\nKaga, equipped with the desired information and experience. He succeeded\r\nin making a true porcelain with a white ground, decorated in a style\r\nfounded, it is said, both on the contemporary Hizen ware and on the\r\nenamelled stoneware of Kochi. Morikaga, a famous artist of Kioto, was\r\nretained to furnish designs for the decoration. We have in the British\r\nMuseum a spherical vase, painted in the five colours with a series of\r\nspirited figures, which may well date from that time (PL. XXVI.).\r\nExamples of this period are rare, but some of the old drug-pots,\r\njealously guarded by their owners, that were still, a few years ago, to\r\nbe seen in the druggists’ and herbalists’ shops of Osaka and Sakai, may\r\nperhaps be traced back to the potters of the seventeenth century, either\r\nthose of Kaga or those of Hizen. At this time, in fact, the Kaga ware\r\nhad hardly differentiated itself from that of the parent province. It\r\nwas not till the beginning of the eighteenth century that the typical\r\nKutani ware, one of the most original and decorative ever turned out\r\nfrom Japanese kilns, was produced.\r\n\r\nOn a greyish paste, hardly to be reckoned as porcelain, the lustrous,\r\nfull-bodied enamels, almost unctuous in quality, are laid with a full\r\nbrush. The whole surface is generally covered, and a dark, juicy green\r\nis the prevailing colour, over which a design of black lines is drawn.\r\nNext in importance among the enamels there comes first purple, then a\r\nheavy blue enamel which somewhat clashes with the other colours, and\r\nfinally a full-toned yellow. It would seem from Japanese accounts that\r\nthis kind of ware was not made after 1730, when there ensued a period of\r\ndecay, but it is difficult to believe the statement that the manufacture\r\nwas not revived till 1810. The picturesquely decorated bowls\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PLATE XXVI._ JAPANESE, KAGA WARE]\r\n\r\nand plates showing the greyish ground are probably later than those\r\nwholly covered with the green enamel, and it might be possible to trace\r\nthe date of introduction of fresh means of decoration--gilding skilfully\r\nand boldly applied or the use of white enamel in relief, especially for\r\nthe petals of flowers. Later, but still on ware of fine decorative\r\neffect, we find these white petals tinged with pink, and this apparently\r\nis the earliest appearance of the _rouge d’or_ among Japanese enamels.\r\n\r\nWhen did this new colour come in, and from what source? We may perhaps\r\nassociate its first use with the wonderful period, early in the\r\nnineteenth century, of which we have already spoken, when all the\r\nrestraints to which the Japanese artist had been so long subjected were\r\nremoved, the crabbed critic with his tradition of Ming times was\r\nsilenced, and a free rein at length given to native exuberance in the\r\nuse of gay colours and naturalistic designs. But this was the end; as in\r\nthe other arts, a period of decline set in before the middle of the\r\ncentury, a decline that was accelerated, but not first originated, by\r\nthe throwing open of the country to European influences a few years\r\nlater.\r\n\r\nWith the Kutani potter, the beginning of the end seems to have coincided\r\nwith the introduction of the iron-red and gold decoration. This was\r\nbrought about when the assistance of one of the Zengoro family, Zengoro\r\nthe eleventh or Hozen, probably, was obtained from Kioto. At the same\r\ntime the brilliant decoration in enamel colours was still carried on,\r\noften enough with happy effect, and this was kept up to quite a late\r\nperiod. In these latter days the use of a true white porcelain again\r\nbecame prevalent--indeed the materials are at the present day brought\r\nfrom Amakusa and other islands off the coast of Hizen.\r\n\r\nThere are two marks that have always been associated with the Kaga\r\nware--first, the character for Kutani, the ‘Nine Valleys,’ the name of\r\nthe little mountain village where the ware was first made; second, the\r\nChinese word _Fu_ (Japanese _Fuku_), meaning ‘prosperity’ or ‘wealth,’\r\nwritten in the seal character. We find this last mark painted in black\r\non the back of the old pieces covered with a green glaze (PL. B. 23).\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn our account of Japanese porcelain we have been hampered by the\r\nrestrictions imposed by our subject. Among Japanese ceramic products\r\nthere is a big middle class, what we have called kaolinic stoneware.\r\nWares of this kind, when made in neighbouring kilns and differing in\r\ntheir decoration in no way from what may be classed as true\r\nporcelain--and this is the case in the pottery districts of Kaga and\r\naround Kioto--have naturally found their way within our limits. Other\r\nkinds quite as near to true porcelain, such as the picturesque fayence\r\nof Inuyama or many of the old Raku wares, have remained unmentioned. The\r\ntemptation to overstep the line has been great, inasmuch as so many of\r\nthe wares showing originality and real artistic merit lie distinctly on\r\nthe further side.\r\n\r\nWe may say finally that a closer acquaintance with Japanese ceramics\r\nwill confirm what may be observed in the case of other branches of\r\nJapanese art--in their painting, for example, and in their lacquer-ware.\r\nI mean the important part played by the critic, using that term in a\r\nwide sense, in restraining the native exuberance of the artist. The\r\nfirst tendency of the European connoisseur is to regret the hampering\r\ninfluence of Chinese tradition and the restrictions imposed upon all new\r\ndevelopments. But when these influences have for a time been removed,\r\nthe facile productiveness of the Japanese artist has always tended to\r\nland him in that pretty and over-decorated style that has found its way\r\ninto middle-class drawing-rooms at home. We find a tendency to this\r\nunrestrained decoration and reckless association of colours creeping\r\ninto favour long\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PLATE XXVII._ JAPANESE, KAGA WARE]\r\n\r\nbefore the opening of the country. Indeed, centuries ago at Kioto, and\r\neven perhaps in the old Nara days, a somewhat similar love of the\r\ntrifling and effeminate may be recognised now and again. The services\r\nrendered by the severe traditions of the old Chinese schools of the Tang\r\nand Sung dynasties, and by the ascetic spirit of the _Cha-no-yu_ in\r\nkeeping within bounds the native tendency to luxuriant overgrowth, must\r\nnot be overlooked. When these influences were removed, the arts soon ran\r\nto seed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nFROM EAST TO WEST\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have now followed the steps by which the dependants and the\r\nneighbours of the ‘Middle Kingdom’ to the North, the East and the South,\r\nacquired the essentially Chinese art of the manufacture of porcelain.\r\nThe next stage in our history brings us at one step to Europe. Before\r\nmaking this stride of more than a thousand leagues from Japan to Central\r\nGermany, it will be convenient to bring together some of the scattered\r\nreferences to the porcelain of China that have been laboriously\r\ndisinterred from the works of the Arab and Christian writers of the\r\nMiddle Ages, and to compare these statements with the scant account of\r\nthe trade with Western lands to be found in the Chinese books of that\r\ntime. We shall then trace rapidly the history of the stages by which the\r\nEuropean nations became better acquainted with the porcelain of the Far\r\nEast so as finally to master the secret of the manufacture.\r\n\r\nFor the earlier period we are dependent almost entirely upon Arab and\r\nChinese sources. The love of the marvellous, the spirit of Sindbad the\r\nSailor, has to be discounted in the first, and we have seen what\r\nreservations we have to make in accepting the statements of the latter.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that it is in the extraordinary development of trade\r\nthat followed the wave of Arab conquest in the seventh century that we\r\nmust find the first possibilities of direct communication with the Far\r\nEast. The great advance made by China in the early and palmy days of the\r\nTang dynasty (618-907) no doubt opened the way for this intercourse. At\r\nthat time China was in possession of a civilisation in many respects as\r\nadvanced as that to be found either at Constantinople or at Bagdad.\r\n\r\nAs early as the year 700 of our era we find mention of a foreign\r\nsettlement at Canton, so that that town can claim a longer record than\r\nany other Chinese port. But it was rather at Khanfu, as the Arabs called\r\nHangchow (or rather its port), the Kinsai of Marco Polo, that, in the\r\ntime of the next dynasty, the Sung (960-1279), the chief trade was\r\ncarried on. Thus we find that Edrisi, who wrote a work on geography\r\n(_c._ 1153) for Roger, the Norman king of Sicily, is eloquent upon the\r\nriches of this port of Khanfu and the neighbouring town Susak (perhaps\r\nSuchow), ‘where they make an unequalled kind of porcelain called\r\n_ghazar_ by the Chinese.’\r\n\r\nAt this time, though many Arab merchants were settled at the ports of\r\nCanton, Zaitun, and Kinsai, the bulk of the commerce, it would seem, was\r\ncarried on in the larger and stronger junks of the Chinese, and the best\r\naccount that we have of the intercourse of China with foreign countries\r\nis to be found in the report on external trade, written by Chao Ju-kua,\r\nearly in the thirteenth century.[127] This Chao was ‘inspector of\r\nforeign shipping’ at Chüan-chou Fu, a town on the coast of Fukien, which\r\nmay perhaps be identified with the Zaitun of Marco Polo. In any case it\r\nwas, at that time, the principal starting-point for foreign commerce. We\r\nhave in his report a curious account of the trade with Bruni, on the\r\nnorth-west coast of Borneo, an island with which the Chinese had\r\nalready had some intercourse for several centuries, and ‘green\r\nporcelain’ is mentioned by him in the list of the merchandise there\r\nimported.\r\n\r\nWe need not dwell here on the well-known passion of the Dyaks of Borneo\r\nfor celadon porcelain, and the big prices that they are prepared to give\r\nfor fine old pieces (_Cf._ Bock, _The Head Hunters of Borneo_, p. 197\r\n_seq._). Of the specimens of celadon and other wares brought from this\r\nisland we shall speak shortly. Modern travellers tell us that the larger\r\njars, ‘decorated with lizards and serpents’ (probably the early\r\nsmooth-skinned dragon of the Chinese), are preserved as heirlooms.\r\nBesides their medicinal value they are a complete protection from evil\r\nspirits for the house in which they are stored. From later Chinese\r\nwriters (of the sixteenth century) we learn that these large jars were\r\nused in Borneo in place of coffins, and it is a significant fact that a\r\nsimilar mode of burial is still in use in Fukien, the district from\r\nwhich these vessels were exported, but not elsewhere in China.\r\n\r\nTo return to our Sung inspector of trade, as quoted by Dr. Hirth, Chao\r\ntells us that at the ports of Cambodja, of Annam, and of Java, the\r\nChinese bartered both green and white porcelain against pepper and other\r\nlocal products. But at that time the great emporium for the Western\r\ntrade was the port known to the Arabs as Sarbaya, the modern Palembang\r\nin the island of Sumatra. Here, or at Lambri, in the same island, the\r\njunks laid up for the winter, and in the spring the Chinese goods were\r\ncarried further west to Quilon, on the Malabar coast of the Deccan, this\r\ntime probably in Arab bottoms. The porcelain and the other Chinese\r\nexports were now distributed to the various lands with which the Arabs\r\ntraded at that time. Chao Ju-kua, in this connection, mentions Guzerate,\r\nand an island that most probably can be identified with Zanzibar. At\r\nany rate, at this last spot fragments of celadon porcelain have been\r\ndiscovered in recent days in association with Chinese ‘cash’ of the\r\ntenth and eleventh centuries.\r\n\r\nThere are scattered notices of this Sinico-Arab trade in the works of\r\nArab geographers and travellers, from Edrisi to Ibn Batuta. The last\r\nwriter, indeed, states that Chinese porcelain has found its way as far\r\nwest as Morocco. It was a happy idea of the Director of the\r\nEthnographical Museum, in the Zwinger at Dresden, to collect from every\r\navailable quarter specimens of Chinese porcelain with the object of\r\nillustrating the wide distribution of the ware in early days, apart from\r\nand mostly previous to that brought about by European agencies. In this\r\ncollection the heavy celadon or ‘martabani’ occupies, as we might\r\nexpect, a prominent place, but the later enamelled wares, including even\r\nsome special types that may be included under the _famille rose_ of the\r\neighteenth century, have been found both in Cairo and in Siam. Here we\r\nsee large, heavy celadon plates, with thick glaze of pea-soup colour,\r\nfrom the Celebes, from Mindanoa and Luzon in the Philippine group, from\r\nCeram and from other islands of the further Indies. On some of these\r\nplates the glaze covers the whole foot, and the unglazed ring, of deep\r\nred colour, on the upper surface, points to a primitive method of\r\nsupport in the kiln similar to that formerly in use in Siam. Other\r\nceladon plates (there are some huge ones, nearly a yard in diameter, in\r\nthe collection), differing little from those found in these southern\r\nislands, came on the one hand from Cairo, and on the other from Korea\r\nand from Japan. From Korea there are also specimens of a curious\r\ncrackle-ware with brownish glaze and a rough decoration in blue, and\r\nfrom Java a figure of Kwan-yin of a native type, covered with a pale,\r\nalmost white, celadon glaze. In the same collection we find plates\r\nroughly decorated with red and green enamels, a style of decoration\r\nwhich may perhaps be traced back to the earlier enamels of Ming times.\r\nExamples of this type of ware--some at least appear to be of\r\nporcelain--have been found both in the Philippines and in Ceylon. To\r\ncome down to more recent times, pieces decorated with large\r\npeony-flowers, enamelled with an opaque white tinted by the _rouge\r\nd’or_, on a bright green ground of leaves, come from the Celebes, from\r\nSiam, and especially from Cairo.[128]\r\n\r\nAt Gotha, in the public museum, is a collection of Chinese porcelain\r\nbrought together by the late Duke of Edinburgh. It is remarkable for the\r\nnumber of fine pieces of early celadon that it contains. As the unique\r\ncollection of Lung-chuan, of Ko yao and of other Sung wares formed by\r\nDr. Hirth, is now comprised in it, this is probably the most important\r\nassemblage of early Chinese porcelain in Europe. These two German\r\ncollections, in the Zwinger at Dresden and at Gotha, complement and\r\nillustrate each other. But we have in England, scattered through our\r\ndifferent museums and private collections, the materials for a series of\r\nat least equal interest--I mean as a commentary on the history of the\r\nspread of Chinese porcelain over the world, a subject to which we must\r\nnow return.\r\n\r\nIn the early days of the Ming dynasty the commercial expeditions of the\r\nChinese took on a more aggressive character. In the time of Yung-lo\r\n(1402-25) the eunuch Chêng-ho sailed with a fleet as far as Ceylon, and\r\nexacted homage, so the Chinese records say, from the king of that\r\nisland. In the next reign, that of Hsuan-te (1425-35), the same admiral\r\nconducted a more peaceful expedition to Hormus, at the entrance of the\r\nPersian Gulf, and in company with merchantmen from India, traded with\r\nthe ports of the Red Sea, from Aden as far up as Jeddah. Both in Ceylon\r\nand at Jeddah (Tien-fong is perhaps rather Mecca itself) we find mention\r\nof green porcelain among the goods imported, and at this last port the\r\nIndian and Chinese merchants established their factories at the very\r\ncentre of the Mohammedan world. (I follow the extracts from the Ming\r\nAnnals given by Dr. Hirth.)\r\n\r\nStill more important was the trade with Hormus and other ports of the\r\nPersian Gulf. We hear incidentally, at a later time, of a large fleet of\r\nChinese junks at anchor in these waters. To us the Chinese trade with\r\nPersia is of special interest, for when, after a brief interval of\r\nPortuguese rule, Hormus fell into our hands, it was in a measure through\r\nthe medium of the Persian ports, and of similar depôts and factories on\r\nthe Indian coast (as, for instance, Surat) that we in England obtained\r\nour earliest specimens of Chinese porcelain.\r\n\r\nAnd now we must take up another thread of our inquiry and return to the\r\nChina of the thirteenth century, the China of Kublai Khan, the greatest\r\nof the Mongol rulers, as described in the book of the Venetian traveller\r\nMarco Polo. Here, in what is for us a classical passage, we find the\r\nfirst known instance of the use of the word porcelain. Marco Polo has\r\nbeen describing the wonders and riches of Zaitun, and he proceeds in his\r\ninconsequent way--we will quote first from the old French text, probably\r\nthe earliest--‘Et sachiez que pres de ceste cité de Çayton a une autre\r\ncité qui a nom Tiunguy, là où l’en fait moult d’escuelles et de\r\npourcelainnes qui sont moult belles. Et en nul autre port on n’en fait,\r\nfors que en cestuy; et en y a l’en moult bon marchie’ (Pauthier, _Marco\r\nPolo_, chapter clvi.).\r\n\r\nTranslating from the later and more expanded Italian text, Colonel Yule\r\nrenders the corresponding passage as follows: ‘Let me tell you that\r\nthere is in this province a town called Tyunju, where they make vessels\r\nof porcelain of all sizes, the finest that can be imagined. They make it\r\nnowhere but in this city, and thence it is exported all over the world.\r\nHere it is abundant and very cheap, insomuch that for a Venice groat you\r\ncan buy three dishes so fine that you could not imagine better.’ In the\r\nstill later version of Ramusio, printed at Venice in 1579, we find one\r\nof the first mentions of the old fable that the porcelain earth was\r\nallowed to weather for two generations before being used. (See Yule,\r\n_Marco Polo_, vol. i. p. cxxii. and vol. ii. pp. 186 and 190.)\r\n\r\nConfining ourselves to the old French version, the point to bear in mind\r\nis the use of the word ‘pourcelainnes’ in this sense as one familiar to\r\nthe reader and requiring no explanation. And yet in the two other\r\npassages of Marco Polo’s book, where the word is found, it is used, and\r\nhere too without further explanation, for the Cowry shells (_Cypræa_)\r\nthat then, as now, took the place of money in certain markets of the\r\nEast. There can be little doubt that the ware of which Marco Polo spoke\r\nwas some kind of celadon, and Dr. Hirth’s identification of Tingui with\r\nLung-chuan is perhaps more plausible than the rival claims of Tekkwa and\r\nKing-te-chen.\r\n\r\nIbn Batuta, the Arab traveller, who wrote nearly fifty years later, says\r\n‘porcelain is made nowhere in China except in the cities of Zaitun and\r\nSinkalon (Canton).’ In this statement he is of course quite wide of the\r\nmark. Like Marco Polo, however, he was struck by the cheapness of the\r\nware, and he mentions that it was exported as far as Maghreb (Morocco).\r\n\r\nThese ‘moult belles pourcelainnes,’ Marco Polo tells us, were to be\r\nfound all over the world. He was probably speaking, as we have said, of\r\na celadon ware, though it is possible that he may have seen the pure\r\nwhite translucent porcelain of Tingchou. Our first distinct notice of\r\nporcelain out of China is indeed of earlier date. In an Arab manuscript\r\nin the _Bibliothèque Nationale_, treating of the life and exploits of\r\nSaladin, we are told that in the year 1171 that great Emir forwarded\r\nfrom Cairo to his feudal lord Nureddin, Sultan of Damascus, a present of\r\nforty pieces of Chinese porcelain, doubtless found among the treasures\r\nof the recently conquered Fatimite caliphs of Egypt.[129] We have every\r\nreason to believe that this store of porcelain, found in the palace of\r\nthe heretic caliphs of ‘Babylon,’ can have consisted of nothing else but\r\nthe much prized ‘martabani,’ of which such wonderful stories are told by\r\nthe Arab and Persian writers.\r\n\r\nThe high estimation in which this ware was held in Persia at a later\r\ndate is well brought out in the following quotation from Chardin, who\r\nwas in Persia in 1672: ‘Everything in the king’s palace is of massive\r\ngold or porcelain. There is a kind of green porcelain so precious that\r\none dish alone is worth 500 crowns. They say that this porcelain detects\r\npoison by changing colour, but that is a fable.[130] Its price arises\r\nfrom its beauty and the delicacy of its materials, which render it\r\ntransparent, though above two crowns in thickness.’ Again, in one of the\r\ntales of the _Arabian Nights_, we hear of six old slaves who bring in a\r\nsalad in a huge basin of ‘martabani’ ware.\r\n\r\nFragments of porcelain, the fine white paste covered with a greyish\r\ngreen glaze, have been found in the rubbish-heaps both of Fostât or Old\r\nCairo and of Rha (the Rhages of the book of Tobit), near Teheran, and as\r\nboth these towns were abandoned at least as early as the thirteenth\r\ncentury, a corresponding age has been claimed for the pot-sherds found\r\namong the ruins.[131] We now know that a true celadon porcelain was made\r\nin Siam, and this ware, there is little doubt, was shipped from the port\r\nof Martabani.[132] But in spite of this fact, and of the evidence of the\r\nname by which the ware was known, by far the larger part of the\r\nporcelain used by the Arabs was probably a true Lung-chuan ware exported\r\nfrom the ports of the Chinese coast, Kinsai, Zaitun, and Canton.\r\n\r\nThe Memlook Sultans of Egypt encouraged commerce with the East. Makrisi\r\ntells us that Kelaun received an embassy from Ceylon. During the\r\nfourteenth century and later, the goods transhipped at Aden were carried\r\nto the ports on the west coast of the Red Sea and then brought overland\r\nto Assuan or to Koos, a town lower down the Nile, near to Koptos. Many\r\nof the large dishes now to be seen in the museums of France and Germany\r\nmay have reached the West by this route, for among the presents that\r\nthe ‘Soldan’ of Egypt sent to Lorenzo de’ Medici in 1487, on the\r\noccasion of an embassy (in addition to some sheep with long ears and\r\ntails as big as their bodies), we find mention of ‘vasi grandi\r\nporcellana mai più veduti simili ne meglio lavorati’ (Marryat, p. 240,\r\nquoting a letter from Bibbiena to Clarice de’ Medici). Before this, in\r\n1447, Charles VII. of France is said to have received from the same\r\nsource ‘trois escuelles de pourcelaine de Sinant,’ besides ‘_platz,\r\ntongues verdes_’ (whatever they may be), and other vessels of the same\r\nmaterial. Again, in 1487 porcelain is mentioned in the maritime laws of\r\nBarcelona among the exports from Egypt. In only one of these notices,\r\nhowever, is the Chinese origin of the porcelain expressly stated, so\r\nthat in the other cases there remains a shadow of a doubt as to what\r\nkind of ware is in question. For we must remember that the word\r\nporcelain was at that time sometimes applied to Saracenic fayence.\r\nIndeed in the old French inventories quoted by the Marquis de Laborde,\r\nvarious kinds of shell-ware, such as frames inlaid with mother-of-pearl,\r\nare referred to as porcelain.\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful whether we can point to a single specimen of porcelain in\r\nour European collections whose history can be traced back as far as the\r\nyear 1500, nor can any exception be made to this statement in favour of\r\nanything to be found in the Treasury of St. Mark at Venice. With the\r\nexception of one small doubtful piece, I have been unable to discover\r\nany specimen of porcelain in that collection. As for the tradition\r\nconcerning the little plate at Dresden inlaid with garnets cut into\r\nfacettes--that it was brought back from the East by a crusader--I am\r\nafraid that this must go the way of so many similar stories. I have had\r\nan opportunity of examining this often-quoted example of early Chinese\r\nporcelain, as well as a cup similarly inlaid in the same collection,\r\nand I quite agree with Dr. Zimmermann, the Curator of the Museum, that\r\nthe setting can hardly be earlier than the sixteenth century, and that\r\nthere is nothing in the ware itself, a plain white Ting porcelain, to\r\npoint to a great age.\r\n\r\nThere remains, then, the bowl of pale sea-green celadon, mounted in\r\nsilver gilt, preserved at New College, Oxford. This is known as the cup\r\nof Archbishop Warham (1504-32): it is said to have been presented to the\r\ncollege by that prelate, and the early date is confirmed by the style of\r\nthe mounting. It is at least a curious coincidence that this celadon\r\ncup, the _doyen_, it would seem, of all the Chinese porcelain in Europe,\r\nshould prove to be a specimen of the ware first exported from\r\nChina.[133]\r\n\r\nM. de Laborde, in his glossary, quotes from the inventory of the goods\r\nof Margaret of Austria, the Regent of the Low Countries during the\r\nminority of her nephew, the future Emperor Charles V., the following\r\nitems among others: Un beau grand pot de pourcelaine bleue à deux\r\nagneaux d’argent. Deux autres esguières d’une sorte de porcelayne bleue.\r\nUng beau gobelet de porcelayne blanche, à couvercle, painct à l’entour\r\nde personnaiges d’hommes et femmes.’\r\n\r\nAn additional interest is given to this inventory of the possessions of\r\nthe Regent Margaret when we remember that it was of her brother that the\r\nfollowing story is told:--In the spring of 1506 Philip started from the\r\nNetherlands for Spain, along with his wife Joanna, to claim for the\r\nlatter the crown of Castile, vacant by the death of the great Queen\r\nIsabella. Driven by a storm into Weymouth Harbour, the pair were\r\nentertained by Sir Thomas Trenchard, the High Sheriff of the county, at\r\nhis house not far from Dorchester. On leaving, Philip gave to his host\r\nsome bowls of Oriental porcelain. Two of these bowls of blue and white\r\nware remain in the possession of the representatives of the Trenchard\r\nfamily. One of them is set in a silver gilt mounting of about 1550, with\r\na London hall-mark on the inside. On the outside of the bowl is a bold\r\nfloral decoration, and inside some quaint archaic fish, similar to those\r\non the Cheng-te bowl in the Salting collection. They have been lately\r\ndescribed by Mr. Winthrop in Gulland’s _Oriental China_, vol. ii.\r\n\r\nWe have now come to a time when a new channel was opened by which the\r\nporcelain and other produce of the Far East could reach Europe. In the\r\nyear 1517 Fernando Perez D’Andrada sailed from Malacca to the roads of\r\nCanton, and the Portuguese not long after established some kind of\r\nunderstanding with the Chinese, which permitted them to trade at that\r\nport and at Ningpo. This arrangement, however, lasted but for a short\r\ntime. Some aggressive proceedings on the part of a new admiral sent out\r\nfrom Portugal aroused the latent hostility of the Ming Government, and\r\nthe newcomers were before long confined to that ambiguous position at\r\nMacao that they occupy to the present day. There does not seem to be any\r\ndirect evidence that porcelain formed part of the merchandise that they\r\nat that time--I mean during the sixteenth century--sent back to Europe;\r\nbut after the end of the century, when Portugal and her colonies were\r\nfor a time absorbed in the vast empire ruled by Philip II. of Spain, a\r\nconsiderable amount of the Oriental ware reached the Peninsula by way of\r\n‘the Indies.’ Specimens of this old porcelain, chiefly of the plain\r\nwhite that the Spanish have always preferred, may still be found, it is\r\nsaid, in some of the royal palaces.\r\n\r\nThe Portuguese in some measure took the place of the Arabs, whose\r\nshipping they had driven out from the Indian seas, and it was now in\r\ntheir ships that the Chinese porcelain was carried to the markets of\r\nIndia and Persia. But by the end of the sixteenth century the\r\nPortuguese, now sailing under the Spanish flag, began to feel the\r\nrivalry of a new power that was destined before long to monopolise\r\nnearly the whole trade of the Far East. In 1604, three ships bearing an\r\nambassador and his suite arrived at Canton. The Chinese were alarmed at\r\nthe singular aspect of these new people, ‘with blue eyes, red hair, and\r\nfeet one cubit and two-tenths long.’ The Dutch, however--for such these\r\nnewcomers were--effected little by this embassy, and it is indeed\r\ndifficult to understand, when we read of the troubled relations of\r\nforeign nations with the fast sinking Ming rulers in those stormy days,\r\nin what manner and by what route the porcelain that was now reaching the\r\nmarkets of India, Persia, and somewhat later, of Europe, in such large\r\nquantities, found its way out from China. After the establishment of the\r\nnew Manchu dynasty in 1644, the three southern provinces, including the\r\nports of the Canton river and of the Fukien coast, long remained in the\r\nhands of the native Chinese admiral or pirate, so well known to\r\nEuropeans as Coxinga, and it was not till some years after the accession\r\nof Kang-he that the imperial authority was established in these parts,\r\nand the trade road re-opened with the newly rebuilt kilns of\r\nKing-te-chen.[134]\r\n\r\nThe English at that time had not much direct intercourse with China.\r\nWhat little reached us from that country seems to have been obtained\r\nrather by piracy than by trade. In the days of Elizabeth, when a Spanish\r\nmerchantman or carrack was captured, next to the bullion there was\r\nnothing that was more eagerly sought for than porcelain, both that which\r\nmight form part of the cargo and any pieces in use at the officers’\r\ntable. As late as the year 1637, it was through the medium of the\r\nPortuguese that the bulk of the English trade with China was carried on.\r\nMeantime, however, we had established ourselves in the Persian Gulf, and\r\nin the year 1623 we assisted Shah Abbas in driving the Portuguese out of\r\nHormus. We had at that time comparatively close relations with Persia,\r\nand there was more than one English adventurer in the service of the\r\ngreat Shah. There is some reason to believe that it was by way of our\r\nfactories or depôts on the Persian Gulf (especially the new\r\nestablishment at Gombroon,[135] on the mainland, opposite the island of\r\nHormus or Ormuz), as well as by those on the coast of India, that the\r\nporcelain of China and Japan first reached England in any quantity. In\r\nthese commercial relations we may no doubt find one of the causes of the\r\nconfusion that so long existed with us between the wares of Persia,\r\nIndia, and China.\r\n\r\nBut Chinese porcelain, as well as Persian fayence, must have reached\r\nEngland by another route--by way of Venice--and this at a somewhat\r\nearlier date. To this connection of ‘china-ware’ with Venice there is\r\nfrequent reference in our Elizabethan literature. Florio in his _Italian\r\nDictionary_ (1598) interprets the word ‘china’ as ‘a Venus basin,’ and\r\n‘china metal’ is explained by Minsheu in his _Spanish Dialogues_ (1599)\r\nas ‘the fine dishes of earth painted such as are brought from Venice.’\r\nHere the reference probably is to Italian or Persian fayence--in fact\r\nthe tendency seems rather to have been to use the word ‘china’ for these\r\nlatter wares and to reserve the term ‘purslane’ or ‘porcelaine’ for the\r\ntrue porcelain of the Far East.\r\n\r\nIndeed there is every likelihood that we may find the origin of our term\r\n‘china,’ used vaguely for the better kinds of glazed ceramic wares,[136]\r\nin the Persian word _chini_, which has long been employed for Chinese\r\nporcelain and for the finer kinds of fayence, both in Persia and in\r\nIndia. The point to bear in mind is that with our ancestors this word\r\nhad no direct connection with the Chinese empire, but rather with Venice\r\nand with Persia. On the other hand, the special ware known as\r\n‘purslane,’ as we have said, was by them connected especially with that\r\nvague country known as ‘the East Indies.’\r\n\r\nAt the New Year, 1587-88, Elizabeth received from Burleigh a porringer\r\n‘of white porselyn’ garnished with gold, and from Mr. Robert Cecil ‘a\r\ncup of grene pursselyne.’ It was not until the beginning of the next\r\ncentury, apparently, that porcelain, decorated with blue under the\r\nglaze, was imported in any quantity. To this time we must assign the\r\nfour pieces of this ‘blue and white’ ware (one bearing the mark of\r\nWan-li) (PL. XXVIII.) long preserved at Burleigh House, the old home of\r\nthe senior branch of the Cecil family (see p. 85).\r\n\r\nBy the middle of the seventeenth century Oriental porcelain had already\r\nbecome an important article of commerce. At that time by far the larger\r\nquantity was imported by the Dutch, and was distributed by them over\r\nFrance and Germany. There is, however, some reason to believe that the\r\nPortuguese continued to import certain classes of ware, but it is\r\ndifficult to\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PLATE XXVIII._ CHINESE]\r\n\r\nfind any direct evidence of this commerce.[137] As for the English\r\ntrade, porcelain is mentioned among the goods imported by the East India\r\nCompany as early as 1631.\r\n\r\nFor the most part this porcelain exported from Canton or from Nagasaki\r\nwas not carried directly to Europe, but found its way first to various\r\nintermediate _entrepôts_ of trade: in the case of the Dutch, to Batavia;\r\nwith us, to certain Indian ports, or perhaps to Gombroon. This was one\r\ncause of the strange names by which the products of China and Japan were\r\nknown, and of the confusion between the wares of the two countries,\r\nwhich has only been cleared up of late years. We hear of Batavian\r\nporcelain, and of East Indian or _porcelaine des Indes_.[138] No doubt\r\nthis ambiguity of origin was encouraged by the rival traders, who were\r\nnot eager to make too public the source of their goods.\r\n\r\nAs to the composition of the ‘purslayne’ brought from the Indies, the\r\nwildest stories were current. Whether it was even of the same nature as\r\nother kinds of pottery was disputed. Even so well-informed a man as Sir\r\nThomas Browne had his doubts. ‘We are not thoroughly resolved,’ he says,\r\n‘concerning porcellane or china dishes, that according to common belief\r\nthey are made of earth.’ The quaint story of the clay being preserved\r\nfor long ages before it was fit for use, we find for the first time\r\napparently in some of the late versions of Marco Polo’s travels. From\r\nMarryat, who collected a wealth of quotations[139] referring to\r\nporcelain from writers of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, we\r\ntake as an example the following (it is from a book written by Guido\r\nPancirolli, a learned jurisconsult and antiquary of Padua, who died in\r\n1599):--‘In former ages, porcelains were never seen. Now they are a\r\ncertain mass composed of gypsum, bruised eggs, the shell of the marine\r\nlocust [perhaps the _Langusta_ or Mediterranean lobster], and other\r\nsubstances; and this, being well tempered and thickened, is hidden\r\nunderground in a secret place, which the father points out to his\r\nchildren, etc.’ He then goes on to speak of the transparency of this\r\nware, and of its property of breaking when any poisonous substance was\r\nplaced in it.\r\n\r\nWe must remember that by this time attempts had already been made in\r\nItaly, both in Tuscany and probably still earlier in Venice, to imitate\r\nthe porcelain of China. These experiments were soon abandoned, but the\r\nmore practical Dutch, not long after this time, succeeded in making with\r\ntheir enamelled earthenware an imitation of the finer Chinese blue and\r\nwhite, closer to the original, as far as external aspect is concerned,\r\nthan anything that has been produced in Europe since that time in ware\r\nof any description. The name of Albregt de Keizer (_circa_ 1661) it\r\nwould seem is to be associated with these excellent copies. There are\r\nsome brilliant specimens of this seventeenth century delft at South\r\nKensington, both in the Keramic Gallery and in the Salting collection.\r\n\r\nEarly in the reign of Charles II., the fashion of drinking tea and\r\nchocolate became fashionable, if not general, in England. Coffee had\r\nbeen introduced somewhat earlier--it came from Turkey by way of Venice.\r\nAlong with these new infusions came the demand for the little cups from\r\nwhich they were to be drunk, and for the pots in which to brew them. The\r\nform and fashion of these came to us not from China but from Venice,\r\nfrom Constantinople, and perhaps ultimately from Persia. One\r\nconsequence of this was that the confusion between the wares of the East\r\nand of the Far East became for the time even greater. In the\r\ndrinking-song quoted on page 243, we find ‘tea-cups and coffee’\r\nassociated with ‘the Turk and the Sophi,’ while not a word is said of\r\nChina.\r\n\r\nAt the same time larger pieces, _garnitures de cheminée_, _pots\r\npourris_, and fish-bowls began to find a place in the decoration of a\r\nnobleman’s house. Before the end of the century there came in a rage for\r\nquaint monsters and figures of Chinese gods, at first chiefly in white\r\nporcelain. Many such pieces may still be found on the mantels and in the\r\nchina-closets of our country houses, but unfortunately we have in few\r\ncases any record of the date of acquisition or of the _provenance_ of\r\nware of this kind.\r\n\r\nAt Hampton Court there is a quantity of old china now well displayed in\r\nthe rooms shown to the public. This is a collection that well repays a\r\nclose examination. Let us see first what it does _not_ contain. The\r\n_famille rose_ is unrepresented. I do not think that the _rouge d’or_\r\nenamel is to be found on a single specimen. The ‘Old Japan’ or Imari is\r\nnot found, at least not in characteristic specimens. On the other hand\r\nthere are many interesting examples of Chinese enamelled ware which we\r\nmay class with the five-colour group (the blue of course _under_ the\r\nglaze). They are roughly painted with figures in Ming costume, but in\r\nthese pieces the green is scarcely prominent enough to allow of our\r\nplacing them among the _famille verte_. They belong rather to that class\r\nof late Wan-li or early Kang-he enamels which formed the starting-point\r\nof the earliest enamelled wares of Imari and Kutani. Of the three-colour\r\nglazes of the _demi grand feu_, I would point to two interesting vases,\r\nabout twelve inches in height, with a mottled decoration of green and\r\ndark purple, and with yellow handles. There are quite a number of large\r\nfish-bowls of blue and white, but these pieces are not remarkable either\r\nfor colour or design. Of more interest are two cylindrical vases\r\ndecorated, _sous couverte_, with blue and pale copper red, and a curious\r\nvase of Persian shape covered with flowers in white slip over a _café au\r\nlait_ ground. Again, the plain white figures of Quanyin, with the\r\n‘Maintenon’ coif, and in some cases with the boy patron of learning at\r\nthe side, are here as abundant relatively as at Dresden, and there is\r\nfinally a well-executed figure of a Buddhist ascetic in white biscuit.\r\nUnless it be by the blue and white, Japan is represented solely by the\r\n‘Kakiyemon’ enamelled ware, with the blue _over the glaze_.\r\n\r\nBut we must not pass over the little glazed cabinet filled with quaint\r\npieces of Chinese porcelain. The contents of this cabinet have, it is\r\nsaid, remained untouched since the day, more than two hundred years ago,\r\nwhen they were arranged by Queen Mary. Among many curious pieces on its\r\nshelves may be seen two buffaloes of a pale celadon ware, four vases of\r\n‘hookah-base’ form, with strange-shaped spouts, and some censers in the\r\nform of kilins.\r\n\r\nThe general impression, we may finally say, given by a somewhat close\r\ninspection of the porcelain at Hampton Court, confirms the little we\r\nknow of the date of its origin. It represents a period anterior to the\r\ngreat renaissance at King-te-chen at the end of the seventeenth century,\r\nbut only just anterior to that time, and it is the absence of the finer\r\nand more brilliant wares made subsequently to this renaissance, examples\r\nof which we are accustomed to see in our modern collections, that gives\r\na certain air of poverty to this porcelain collected by our ancestors.\r\n\r\nIn some of the palaces and castles of Germany may still be seen\r\ncollections of china made in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries,\r\ncrowded together in the porcelain cabinet. Of these the best known,\r\nperhaps, is that at the ‘Favorite,’ near Baden, but there are others in\r\nthe castle of the Waldstein family at Dux in Bohemia, and in Hungary in\r\nthe castle of Prince Esterhazy. Many of these collections have remained\r\nunaltered since the time when they were first brought together, and it\r\nis in this fact that their principal interest lies.\r\n\r\nThese china-cabinets are, of course, all eclipsed by the vast collection\r\nbrought together, at the beginning of the eighteenth century, by\r\nAugustus the Strong, Elector of Saxony and (at intervals) King of\r\nPoland. But this collection has undergone many vicissitudes since the\r\ntime when it was first established in the handsome palace in the\r\nNeustadt at Dresden. It escaped, indeed, with little damage from the\r\nPrussian cannons during the Seven Years’ War; at the end of the century,\r\nhowever, it was removed to a gloomy basement, but so carelessly was this\r\ndone that we hear of whole chests packed with broken fragments. In this\r\nill-arranged and dark room the collection remained for nearly a century,\r\nuntil at last it has found a home in the well-lit galleries of the\r\nJohanneum. Here it is now seen to full advantage, thanks to an\r\narrangement which combines historical sequence with a regard to general\r\neffect.\r\n\r\nAugustus the Strong died in 1733, and it is doubtful whether his\r\nsuccessor, August II. (August III. of Poland), who was above all a\r\ncollector of pictures, added to the collection.[140] There were, it\r\nwould seem, some examples of porcelain in the electoral collection at a\r\nmuch earlier date.[141] In an inventory of 1640 several pieces of\r\nporcelain are mentioned, and these are said to have been presented by\r\nthe _Herzog von Florentz_ in the year 1590. Among them (they cannot now\r\nbe identified) we find a vase of porcelain (_ein Pokal von Porcellana_),\r\nblue and red with gilding, in the form of a crab; another in the form of\r\na dragon, coloured green and blue; a lantern of porcelain, green and\r\ngold, adorned at the top with a standing figure; a small ‘pokal,’ gilt\r\nand painted with all kinds of colours; and finally some large\r\neight-sided dishes decorated with blue. We should have expected to find\r\nsome examples of the new Medici porcelain along with these, but in the\r\ninventory in question there is no mention of anything of the kind.\r\n\r\nAugustus the Strong obtained most of his porcelain from Dutch dealers--a\r\ncertain Le Roy at Amsterdam is specially mentioned. Already in 1709 we\r\nfind him lending eight statuettes of white Chinese ware to Böttger, then\r\nengaged with his experiments on the Königstein. In the year 1717 he\r\nreceived from the King of Prussia nearly a hundred important vases and\r\ndishes. In return for these, it is said, the king obtained a regiment\r\n(or company) of tall dragoons, but this part of the bargain is not\r\nmentioned in the official receipt for the porcelain, which has been\r\npreserved.\r\n\r\nI have more than once referred to individual specimens in this famous\r\ncollection, and I shall not attempt to describe it now. Suffice to say\r\nthat the general impression given is that it is of a somewhat later date\r\nthan that at Hampton Court. Apart from a few early pieces which have\r\nbeen already mentioned, and from some specimens of the _famille rose_\r\n(and on these the new _rouge d’or_ is for the most part sparingly and,\r\nas it were, tentatively applied), the coloured enamel ware in the\r\nDresden collection belongs in the bulk to the _famille verte_, and upon\r\nintrinsic evidence might be attributed to the later years of Kang-he and\r\nto the reign of his successor Yung-ching, say from 1690 to 1730. On the\r\nJapanese side, we notice a number of dishes and vases in blue and white,\r\nrather in the style of the later Ming ware exported to India and Persia,\r\na few choice specimens of the enamelled ‘Kakiyemon,’ and then the vast\r\nseries of ‘Old Japan’ or Imari porcelain--plates, vases, and bowls, many\r\nof large size. Much of this last class was made to order, and this part\r\nreflects the bad taste of the day. We find tall vases ‘adorned’ with\r\nfigures and flowers modelled in full relief in a kind of stucco and\r\ngaudily painted with some oil medium or varnish. Some are converted into\r\ncages for birds or squirrels by an external railing of brass rods.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of a few fine _garnitures_ in blue and white in ‘’t\r\nHuis ten Bosch’ at the Hague, there appear to be no public collections\r\nin Holland dating from the eighteenth century. But in spite of the\r\nrepeated razzias of dealers, both native and foreign, many old families\r\nstill retain collections of Chinese porcelain (of blue and white\r\nespecially), some of which may date from the latter part of the\r\nseventeenth century, and many a rough-looking farmer, in country\r\ndistricts, prides himself on the china-cabinet that he has inherited\r\nfrom his ancestors.\r\n\r\nFrancis I. of France and his son Henri II. were, as is well known, great\r\ncollectors of works of art, and their collections at Fontainebleau may\r\nbe regarded as the foundation of the national museums of France. The\r\nRev. Père Dan, who described these collections at a later date, in his\r\n_Trésors des Merveilles de Fontainebleau_ (1640) says--‘La étoient aussi\r\ndes vases et vaisselles en porcelaines de la Chine,’ and in an\r\neighteenth century notice we hear of a ‘vase de porcelaine de première\r\nqualité ancienne de la Chine,’ which is said to have come from the\r\ncollection of Sully, the minister of Henri IV. In the second half of the\r\nseventeenth century, at the great yearly fairs held in the\r\nneighbourhood of Paris, Portuguese travelling merchants set up their\r\nstalls for the sale of _les besognes de Chine_.[142] In 1678 the Duchess\r\nof Cleveland’s porcelain was sold at the fair of St. Laurent. The\r\n_Mercure_ of the day gives a list of the figures and mounted pieces.\r\nLouis XIV., we are told, was surprised at the knowledge of Oriental\r\nporcelain shown by James II.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the seventeenth century it became the fashion among the\r\n_grands Seigneurs_ of the court of Louis XIV. to collect the _porcelaine\r\ndes Indes_, the Dauphin and the Duke of Orleans leading the way, and\r\nthrough the agency of the short-lived _Compagnie de la Chine_[143]\r\n(1685-1719) the latter prince was able to obtain from the East vases\r\ndecorated with his arms,[144] while of the Dauphin we hear that he\r\narranged his collection of blue and white in cabinets constructed by the\r\nfamous ebonist Boule. Unfortunately the gallery at Versailles where they\r\nwere placed was burned down soon afterwards (Du Sartel, _La Porcelaine\r\nde la Chine_, p. 121). The porcelain of these princely collectors was\r\nsold at a later time, and most of it passed into the hands of the\r\nVicomte de Fonspertuis; it was again dispersed when the works of art in\r\nthat famous collection were sold by auction in 1747. The catalogue on\r\nthis occasion was prepared by Gersaint,[145] the great dealer of the\r\nday, for whose shop on the Pont Notre-Dame Watteau painted his famous\r\n_Enseigne_. The notes in this catalogue are of some interest, in that\r\nthey are, perhaps, the earliest attempt, at least from a Western point\r\nof view, at a critical description of Oriental porcelain. We can only\r\ncall attention to the remarks of Gersaint on the new enamel colours,\r\nwhich in opposition to the blue and white ‘_on voit seulement depuis\r\nquelques années_’; on the white ware with its ‘_ton velouté, doux et\r\nmat_,’ which he tells us Spanish collectors prefer to all others, and on\r\nthe figures, animals, and ornaments which the Dutch ‘_souvent mal à\r\npropos_’ painted over the beautiful white ware of China. Gersaint\r\nridicules also the fashion that will have nothing to say to any piece\r\nwithout the brown line upon the lip or edge, so characteristic of the\r\nporcelain imported about this time, and finally he calls attention to\r\nthe excellent imitation of the ‘Ancien Japon,’ made _some time since_ at\r\nDresden. A few specimens of this Saxon ware are the only examples of\r\nEuropean pottery in this extensive and varied collection.\r\n\r\nSome twenty years later the collections of another friend and patron of\r\nWatteau, M. de Jullienne, were sold by auction in the _Salon Carré_ of\r\nthe Louvre, and a detailed catalogue of the Oriental ware was drawn up\r\nby the dealer Julliot. But for a more detailed account of the French\r\ncollections and collectors of the eighteenth century, we must refer the\r\nreader to the chapter on this subject in M. Du Sartel’s already quoted\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nIn the lengthy treatise of the Abbé Raynal on the history of the\r\n_Commerce des Européens dans les Deux Indes_, there is an interesting\r\nsection treating of the porcelain of China and Japan, and of the\r\nrelation of these Oriental wares to the porcelain of Saxony and France.\r\nThe work was first published in 1770, but the remarks on porcelain were\r\nprobably written several years earlier. We have already noticed the six\r\nclasses into which he divides the wares imported from the East. We can\r\nonly note here that Raynal distinguishes the two classes of _porcelaine\r\nblanche_--one of creamy tint, and the other cold and bluish. This ware,\r\nhe says, was imitated at Saint-Cloud, but with ‘frit’ and lead glaze.\r\nHis sympathies are all for the true porcelain of Dresden, and for the\r\nware lately made in France by the Count Lauraguais.\r\n\r\nWe have attempted in this chapter, perhaps at too great a length for a\r\nwork of this kind, to follow the steps by which the knowledge and\r\nappreciation of Oriental porcelain spread gradually through the West. It\r\nwill be our next task to show, as briefly as possible, how on the ground\r\nthus prepared there arose on all sides a desire to imitate this\r\nbeautiful ware.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST ATTEMPTS AT IMITATION IN EUROPE\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat, then, were the wares with which the porcelain of the Far East came\r\ninto competition, when during the course of the seventeenth century it\r\nreached Europe in ever increasing quantity? It was not the ordinary\r\nlead-glazed pottery, or the salt-glazed stoneware in common use, that\r\nfelt this competition. Crockery of this sort would always be protected\r\nby its cheapness. The rivalry was rather with the more artistic ware\r\nfound on the tables of the richer sort of people, much of it made for\r\nornament only. Now at this time, ware of this latter kind all came under\r\nthe class of _enamelled fayence_--earthenware, that is, whose dull\r\nsurface was rendered bright and shining by a coating of stanniferous\r\nenamel; on this artificial surface the decoration, often pre-eminent in\r\nartistic merit, was painted. It is not our business here to show how\r\nthis great ceramic family of stanniferous enamelled ware, which had now\r\nspread over Europe, had its origin in the nearer or Saracenic East, just\r\nas the porcelain, which in a measure was destined to replace it, can all\r\nbe traced back to a Chinese source. Suffice to say that, starting from\r\nthe Moorish potteries of Spain, this enamelled fayence gradually\r\nreplaced the old lead-glazed slip ware of the Italian _quattrocento_,\r\nand in the sixteenth century was carried by Italian workmen to France,\r\nwhere important centres of manufacture were established at Rouen and at\r\nNevers.\r\n\r\nBut it was rather the fayence of Delft, a ware of essentially the same\r\nclass as the last, and one which, during the seventeenth century, was\r\npushing its way into the markets of France and of England, that first\r\nfelt the competition of the porcelain now imported from the Far East.\r\nThe fact is that all these enamelled wares suffered from one great\r\ndefect. It was not so much their lack of translucency or the softness of\r\ntheir paste that was at fault, but rather the fact that they made\r\npretence to be something better than they really were ‘at heart.’\r\nCompared to porcelain, they are as plated ware to real silver, and time\r\nand wear are apt only too soon to reveal the base nature of their body.\r\nWherever the enamel is chipped off, the dirt lodges, and greasy matter\r\nfinds its way into the porous paste, causing a wide spreading stain.\r\nThis is a practical, and, we may also add, a hygienic defect, that is\r\nnow sometimes forgotten, the more so as nowadays our common table ware\r\nis free from this fault, and resembles fine porcelain in so far that the\r\nwhite, compact body is covered by nothing but the transparent glaze. In\r\nfact, as far as European experience is concerned, we may say, broadly,\r\nthat the merits of porcelain compared with those of fayence are rather\r\nof a practical than of an artistic nature.[146]\r\n\r\nIt will be convenient to divide the history of European porcelain into\r\ntwo periods. The first, with which we are alone concerned in this\r\nchapter, deals with a time of isolated and tentative experiments. We are\r\nconcerned in Italy with the experiments of the Venetian alchemists which\r\nform an introduction to the porcelain made by the Tuscan Grand-Duke; in\r\nEngland with the early researches of Dr. Dwight and others; and finally,\r\nin France with the more successful efforts of the potters of Rouen and\r\nSaint-Cloud. The second period opens with the great discovery of Böttger\r\nat the beginning of the eighteenth century. The porcelain made\r\nsubsequent to this may be divided conveniently into three groups: (1)\r\nthe true porcelain of Germany; (2) the artificial soft paste of France;\r\nand (3) the so-called natural soft paste of England. These are the most\r\nimportant types; and other wares such as the ‘mixed or hybrid pastes’ of\r\nItaly and Spain, and the hard, true porcelains of England and France,\r\ncan be most conveniently treated in connection with the second and third\r\ndivisions.\r\n\r\nEARLY VENETIAN PORCELAIN.--Of all the cities of Europe we might, on\r\ntheoretical grounds, expect to find in Venice the place above all others\r\nwhere the question of the composition of porcelain would at an early\r\ndate attract attention, and indeed, the evidence brought to light by the\r\nBaron Davillier (_Les Origines de la Porcelaine en Europe_, 1882) and by\r\nthe late Sir William Drake (_Notes on Venetian Ceramics_, London, 1868,\r\nprivately printed) fully proves that more than one alchemist or\r\n‘arcanist’ of that city, in one case as early as the fifteenth century,\r\nproduced specimens worthy to be called ‘_porcellane transparente e\r\nvaghissime_,’ and this by contemporaries who had some opportunity of\r\nseeing the real porcelain of China.[147]\r\n\r\nThis ‘transparent and beautiful porcelain’ was made in 1470 by Master\r\nAntonio, the alchemist, at his kiln by San Simeon, and the writer of a\r\nnotice that has been preserved sends two specimens of this ware to his\r\nfriend in Padua. Again, in 1518 we hear of ‘a new artifice not known\r\nbefore in this illustrious city, to make all kinds of porcelain like to\r\nthe transparent wares of the Levant’; and a year later the ambassador of\r\nthe Duke Alfonso writes to his master at Ferrara, sending him specimens\r\nof the _porcellana ficta_ made by a certain Caterino Zen, whom he has\r\npersuaded to emigrate to the latter city.\r\n\r\nThere cannot be the slightest doubt that in all these instances the\r\nwriters are referring to attempts at the manufacture of something\r\nresembling, in its transparency at least, the porcelain of China. There\r\nis no question of any confusion with the majolica of the day, with whose\r\nproperties these men were well acquainted, and we may therefore\r\nreasonably regard the Venetian ‘archimisti’ as the first in Europe to\r\nmake a soft-paste porcelain. As in the case of later experimenters,\r\ntranslucency, rather than hardness or refractory qualities, was the\r\npoint aimed at; and from the few hints we get as to the substances\r\nemployed, we may infer that these old ‘archimisti’ started with the idea\r\nof combining the properties of glass and of fayence by mixing a ‘frit,’\r\nor glassy element, with various kinds of pure white clay.\r\n\r\nIt is unfortunately true that we can point to no single existing\r\nspecimen of Italian porcelain that can safely be referred to so early a\r\ndate; but it must at the same time be remembered that it was only in the\r\nyear 1857 that the first piece of Medici porcelain was identified by\r\nSignor Foresi, and that as late as 1859 a flask-shaped vase of this ware\r\nwas sold at the Hôtel Drouot as a specimen of Japanese porcelain!\r\n\r\nMEDICI PORCELAIN.--The first mention of this now well-known ware is\r\nprobably to be found in Vasari’s _Lives of the Painters_. It is in his\r\naccount of Bernardo Buontalenti, painter, sculptor, architect, and\r\nmechanical genius, who, in all these capacities,\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PLATE XXIX._ MEDICI, BLUE AND WHITE]\r\n\r\nwas in great favour with Cosmo, the first Grand-Duke of Tuscany, and\r\nstill more with his son Francesco. ‘Bernardo,’ says Vasari, who was a\r\ncontemporary, ‘applies himself to everything, as may be seen by the\r\nvases of porcelain which he has made in so short a time--vases which\r\nhave all the perfection of the most ancient and the most perfect.’ He\r\ncould make objects of all kinds in porcelain. ‘Of all these things our\r\nprince [Francesco the Grand-Duke] possesses the methods of manufacture.’\r\n\r\nFrancesco Maria, the second Grand-Duke of Tuscany, was neither a good\r\nprince nor a faithful husband. He was, however, by nature an\r\nenthusiastic and patient experimenter, and a chemist after the manner of\r\nthe day. Soon after his accession, in 1576, the Venetian envoy writes of\r\nhim--I abbreviate here and there: ‘He has found the way to make the\r\nporcelain of India; he has equalled them in transparence, in lightness,\r\nand in delicacy. With the help of a Levantine he worked for more than\r\nten years, spoiling thousands of pieces, before producing perfect work.\r\nHe passes his whole day in his _casino_ [in the Boboli Gardens]\r\nsurrounded by alembics and filters, making, among other things, false\r\njewels, and fireworks.’\r\n\r\nWe learn also, from a contemporary manuscript, that the paste of this\r\nporcelain was formed by mixing certain white earths from Siena and from\r\nVicenza with a frit, itself made from pounded rock crystal fused with\r\nsoda and glassmakers’ sand. The Vicenza clay, at all events, was\r\nprobably of a kaolinic nature. After shaping on the wheel and drying,\r\nthe decoration was painted on the raw paste, and the vessel subjected to\r\na preliminary firing; the plumbiferous glaze was then applied to the\r\nbiscuit. This Medici ware is decorated for the most part with cobalt\r\nblue alone, but occasionally a little purple, and still more rarely\r\nother colours are added. The design is made up of sprigs of\r\nconventionalised flowers and leaves connected by fine stalks,\r\nsuggesting, on the whole, a Persian rather than a Chinese influence. In\r\na few cases we find the renaissance arabesques (or, more properly,\r\ngrotesques) of the time combined with masks in relief. The usual mark is\r\na hasty outline of the dome of the Cathedral of Florence, and below it\r\nthe letter F; on a few pieces, those especially which are decorated with\r\nthe grotesques, we find the six roundels, or ‘palle,’ of the Medici,\r\nsurmounted by the ducal coronet. A few pieces are dated. The earliest\r\ndate that has been discovered--1581--is on a bottle of square section,\r\nrudely painted, under a crackle glaze, with the arms of Spain.\r\n\r\nAs might be expected in the case of an experimental ware of amateurish\r\norigin, the extant pieces differ much in technical merit. Some are\r\nheavily moulded, with a rough decoration of dark blue (I refer to some\r\npieces now in the Louvre); while on others, as on the fine but damaged\r\nbowl at South Kensington, a delicate design is carefully painted (PL.\r\nXXX.). The ground, however, of this Medici porcelain is seldom of a pure\r\nwhite, and the colours have a tendency to run. Now that the specimens\r\nfrom the Davillier and Rothschild collections have found their way into\r\nthe Louvre, this ware is best represented in that gallery. There are,\r\nhowever, several pieces at Sèvres, and some good examples at South\r\nKensington. The later history of this ware is obscure. The kilns appear\r\nto have been removed to Pisa, and their existence cannot be traced later\r\nthan 1620.\r\n\r\nROUEN PORCELAIN.--For a period of two generations and more after this\r\ndate it would seem that little was attempted. The vague assertions found\r\nin patents taken out during this time in England and in France are of\r\nslight value for us, for the claim is only made to an _imitation_ of the\r\nEastern ware, and such an expression might apply to many kinds of\r\nenamelled fayence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PLATE XXX._ MEDICI, BLUE AND WHITE]\r\n\r\nIn France,[148] Claude Reverend, in 1664, is authorised to ‘_contrefaire\r\nla porcelaine à la façon des Indes_.’ A more serious interest attaches\r\nto the letters-patent granted in 1673 to Louis Poterat of Rouen. This\r\nPoterat was a man of some position; he belonged to a family that had\r\nlong been connected with the manufacture of enamelled fayence at St.\r\nSever, near Rouen. In the diploma of 1673 facilities are granted him by\r\nthe king for making vessels of porcelain similar to those of China by\r\nmeans of the secret process that he had discovered for manufacturing\r\n‘_la véritable porcelaine de la Chine_.’ There exist certain little\r\npieces of soft-paste porcelain, sparely decorated with arabesques and\r\n_lambrequins_ in blue _sous couverte_, in the style of Louis XIV., and\r\nmarked with the letters A.P. surmounted by a small star.[149] These are\r\nnow generally classed as Rouen ware of the time of Poterat; in that\r\ncase, we must see in them the earliest specimens of the French family of\r\n_porcelaines tendres_. We have seen specimens at Sèvres and at Dresden,\r\nin both cases little cylindrical boxes divided into compartments. A\r\nsimilarly decorated cup, of very translucent ware, in the Fitzhenry\r\ncollection, is also attributed to Rouen.\r\n\r\nThere were probably at this time and later many others, _arcanistes_ or\r\npractical potters, working at the problem in France. M. Vogt quotes,\r\nfrom the _Comptes des Bâtiments du Roi_ for 1682, two singular payments\r\nfor the transport of ‘terre de porcelaine’ from Le Havre to Rouen and\r\nthence to Paris. This porcelain earth had, it is stated, been previously\r\nshipped to Civita Vecchia. It has been suggested that this might refer\r\nto a cargo of kaolin sent from the East (_La Porcelaine_, p. 34).\r\n\r\nIn 1695 the king granted to the Chicoineau family the privilege of\r\nmaking porcelain, by means of a secret process, reserving only the right\r\npreviously granted to Poterat of Rouen.\r\n\r\nWith the establishment, however, of the Saint-Cloud kilns we pass out of\r\nthe stage of tentative experiment, and the porcelain of Saint-Cloud\r\nforms the proper introduction to the soft-paste wares of France.\r\n\r\nEARLY EXPERIMENTS IN ENGLAND.--The potters art was at a very low ebb in\r\nEngland in the seventeenth century. The Dutch with their Delft ware had\r\ntaken up a position comparable to that held by our Staffordshire potters\r\na century and a half later. They supplied us for many years with the\r\nordinary crockery in use among the middle classes (indeed, in parts of\r\nIreland such ware is still known as ‘delf’). From the scattered local\r\npotteries were produced only the roughest kinds of earthenware. But in\r\nthis rude ware we see at times a certain barbaric, almost Oriental\r\nfeeling for colour and decoration, giving more promise of artistic\r\npossibilities than we can find in the tame imitative work of the\r\neighteenth century porcelain maker.\r\n\r\nQuite early in the seventeenth century, however, certainly by the time\r\nof Charles I., pottery works were established by the banks of the Thames\r\nat Lambeth and elsewhere, where successful imitations of Delft were\r\nmade, probably with the assistance of Dutch workmen. Not far off, at\r\nFulham, Dr. John Dwight experimented upon various clays and glazes, in\r\nthe reign of Charles II. His is the earliest name that occurs in the\r\nhistory of English ceramics. In the letters-patent granted to him in\r\n1671, he claims that ‘at his own proper costs and charges he hath\r\ninvented and set up at Fulham ... several new manufactories.’ Not only\r\nwas he prepared to deal with ‘the misterie of the stoneware vulgarly\r\ncalled Cologne ware,’ but he also lays claim to ‘the mysterie of\r\ntransparent earthenware, commonly knowne by the name of porcelaine or\r\nchina, and Persian ware.’ This claim is made even more definitely by his\r\nfriend Dr. Plot, in the _History of Oxfordshire_, which he published in\r\n1677. Dr. Dwight, he tells us, ‘hath found ways to make an earth _white\r\nand transparent as porcelane_, and not distinguishable from it by the\r\neye or by experiments which have been purposely made to try wherein they\r\ndisagree.’\r\n\r\nWe may compare this claim with the similar statements made about the\r\nsame time in the petitions of Poterat and others. In neither case is\r\nthere any sign of an acquaintance with the Chinese _materials_. In\r\nFrance the aim was to make something that should combine the properties\r\nof earthenware and glass; while in the case of Dr. Dwight’s ware,\r\nhardness and infusibility were the points sought for.\r\n\r\nThe portrait busts and statuettes in the British Museum, and a famous\r\npiece at South Kensington, are all that remain of Dr. Dwight’s wares.\r\nThese were until lately in the hands of his descendants, and are,\r\ntherefore, thoroughly authenticated.[150] In the former collection are\r\ntwo figures, a sportsman and a girl with two lambs, which in spirit and\r\nsharpness of execution compare favourably with our later imitations of\r\nMeissen porcelain in soft paste. A thin, apparently non-plumbiferous\r\nglaze covers a white body, which is undoubtedly of great hardness and\r\npossibly just translucent (‘approaching in some cases to translucency,’\r\nsays the writer of the ‘Jermyn Street’ Catalogue). Unfortunately there\r\nhas survived nothing to illustrate his imitations of Chinese and Persian\r\nware. Dr. Dwight was a man of some social position, and a Master of\r\nArts of Christ Church, Oxford. The very considerable merit of his\r\nstoneware figures (and we may add, the pathetic interest attaching to\r\nthe little figure of a dead child, at South Kensington, inscribed ‘Lydia\r\nDwight, dyed March 3rd, 1673’) have established his position as the\r\nfather of English ceramics, and on this ground he has found a place\r\nalong with Duesbury and Wedgwood in the _Dictionary of National\r\nBiography_. For us his stoneware has a special interest. It is perhaps\r\nthe only ceramic ware in existence that has so many of the\r\ncharacteristics of true porcelain--its hardness, its resistance to high\r\ntemperatures, and to some extent also its translucency and whiteness of\r\npaste--but which in origin and chemical composition differs so entirely\r\nfrom the normal type.\r\n\r\nDr. Place of York was a contemporary of Dwight; he devoted much time to\r\nexperiments on various kinds of clay. Although he has some claim to rank\r\nas an artistic potter, I do not think that there is any proof that he\r\never made porcelain of either hard or soft paste.\r\n\r\nIt is certainly remarkable that during the following fifty years and\r\nmore we hear nothing in England of any attempt to manufacture porcelain,\r\nnor is there any patent or contemporary notice bearing on the subject\r\nduring the interval between Dr. Dwight’s specification of 1684 and the\r\ndate of Frye’s first patent. A claim to make porcelain by working up the\r\nground fragments of Oriental ware with some gummy materials is perhaps\r\nthe only exception.\r\n\r\nBut in England, as elsewhere, the ‘ware of the Indies’ was coming more\r\nand more into favour, and its partial victory over foreign and native\r\nstoneware and pottery is, as we said above, closely connected with the\r\nincreasing popularity of tea and coffee. Sack and claret were still\r\nserved in bottles of Delft ware, and beer in stoneware jugs and\r\ntankards. A certain suspicion of effeminacy and degeneracy came to be\r\nassociated both with tea and coffee, and with the ware in which they\r\nwere served.[151] Even now, any ridicule to which the china-collector is\r\nexposed is generally associated with a teapot.\r\n\r\nWe have in this chapter traced the early attempts made in Italy, as well\r\nas those in France and England, to imitate the porcelain of the Far\r\nEast. We must now turn aside to Saxony, where, at the dawn of the\r\neighteenth century, the problem was solved by the genius of a poor\r\nchemist’s assistant. We will then run rapidly through the many centres\r\nwhere hard-paste porcelain was made in Germany, before returning to the\r\nsoft-paste wares of England and France.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nTHE HARD-PASTE PORCELAIN OF GERMANY\r\n\r\n\r\nBÖTTGER AND THE PORCELAIN OF MEISSEN\r\n\r\nWe have already more than once come across the famous Elector of Saxony,\r\nwho found time, between his Polish wars and his innumerable amours, to\r\nbring together the nucleus, at least, of more than one of the great\r\ncollections that have since his time attracted visitors to Dresden. In\r\nthe historical collections of the Johanneum and in the Grüne Gewölbe, we\r\nfind his name associated with many things of great beauty--arms and\r\narmour, silver plate and jewellery; but still, even after making every\r\nallowance for the strange taste of the time, the general impression of\r\nthe man which we get from the objects brought together by him is not\r\nexactly that of a refined amateur. In fact, the German phase of the\r\nschool that had its origin in the Rome of Bernini and in the Versailles\r\nof Louis XIV. found in the court of Augustus the Strong its true home.\r\nNowhere else can we find more characteristic examples of that mixture of\r\npomposity and childishness, that absence of all feeling for purity of\r\nline, which distinguishes the German ‘rococo,’ than in these collections\r\nand in the buildings that hold them.\r\n\r\nNow, it was under the direct patronage of this prince that the\r\nmanufacture of porcelain was first established in Europe, and what we\r\nmay call the taint of its original home has hung about the ware ever\r\nsince. Of the porcelain of Europe as a whole--and this is especially\r\ntrue of the earlier and more interesting period--we may say that it\r\nbelongs to the rococo school, tempered now and again by a more or less\r\nill-understood imitation of Chinese and Japanese shapes and designs.\r\n\r\nAugustus collected works of art of nearly every kind, with the important\r\nexception, indeed, of pictures and sculpture--these branches were at\r\nthis time comparatively neglected. But his heart was set, above all,\r\nupon gathering to his new palace in the Neustadt, every fine specimen of\r\nthe Oriental porcelain that reached Europe. What more natural than that\r\nhe should be seized with the ambition of himself producing in his own\r\ncapital something that would rival the wares of China and Japan? No one\r\nhad better opportunities--if not himself in direct communication with\r\nthe East, his agents were in a position to glean and to bring to him\r\nwhatever meagre information about the manufacture of porcelain might\r\nreach Europe. His court was a Catholic centre, and he must have taken\r\ninterest in the accounts of the industries of China sent home by the\r\nJesuit missionaries. The first of the famous letters of the Père\r\nD’Entrecolles on the porcelain of King-te-chen is indeed of just too\r\nlate a date for us to think of it in this connection. By that time\r\n(1712) Böttger was already making true porcelain. But what would seem\r\nmore probable than that other private letters, with valuable information\r\nabout the manufacture in which the Elector took so great an interest,\r\nmay have reached him a few years earlier? The Père D’Entrecolles, we\r\nknow, had already for several years previous to 1709 (the approximate\r\ndate of Böttger’s discovery) been living at Juchou, in the neighbourhood\r\nof King-te-chen.\r\n\r\nWhen we consider the rapidity with which Böttger’s experiments were\r\nbrought to a successful issue, and compare this with the long and\r\nfruitless research in other countries, it is impossible to resist a\r\nsuspicion of some such infiltration from Chinese sources, and this\r\nsuspicion is enhanced by the somewhat suspicious story of Böttger’s\r\ncareer. But, on the other hand, no confirmation has, so far, been found\r\nfor any such theory. On the contrary, I understand that researches made\r\nof late in the State archives of Saxony have rather tended to show that\r\nsome injustice has been done to Böttger in the common tradition; that we\r\nmust look upon him as a man of considerable scientific attainments for\r\nhis age and as a born experimenter, and it must also be remembered that\r\nat that time no great distinction was made between the chemist and the\r\nalchemist.\r\n\r\nJohann Friedrich Böttger was born in the year 1685 at Schleiz, in the\r\nVoigtland, where his father had a charge connected with a local mint. He\r\nwas early apprenticed to an apothecary at Berlin, and here he was\r\ninitiated into the secrets of alchemy by no less a master--so at least\r\nthe story goes--than the Greek monk Lascaris, a man who is mentioned\r\nwith admiration by Leibnitz, and who is claimed as one of the ‘five\r\nadepts.’ In 1701 Böttger fled from Berlin--it is not quite clear for\r\nwhat reason--and placed himself under the protection of the Elector of\r\nSaxony. At Dresden and, later on, the rock fortress of the Königstein,\r\nhe continued his search for the philosopher’s stone, and about this\r\ntime, probably in conjunction with the mathematician and physicist\r\nWalther von Tschirnhaus, began making experiments upon clay--in search,\r\nat first at least, of a refractory material for his crucibles.\r\nTschirnhaus had already been occupied with improvements in the\r\nmanufacture of glass in Saxony, and as early as the year 1699 had made\r\nattempts to imitate Chinese porcelain.[152]\r\n\r\nIn spite of an unsuccessful attempt at flight we find Böttger, in the\r\nyears 1705 to 1707, established in a laboratory in the old castle of\r\nMeissen. Here, after another effort to escape, for which he narrowly\r\nmissed being hanged--at any rate so we are told--Böttger, when\r\nexperimenting on some red fireclay from the neighbourhood of Okrilla,\r\nfell upon the famous red ware that resembles so closely the Chinese\r\n‘boccaro.’ This was in 1707. The next year Tschirnhaus died, and by\r\n1709, if we are to trust the statement of Steinbrück, the brother-in-law\r\nof Böttger and his immediate successor, the latter had succeeded in\r\nmaking a true white porcelain.\r\n\r\nShortly before this time he had been working, in company with\r\nTschirnhaus, in a laboratory constructed for them on the Jungfern-Bastei\r\nat Dresden, and it must have been about the time of the death of the\r\nlatter that the critical experiments were made that led to the\r\nproduction of a white translucent paste. If this be so, it would seem\r\nthat it was, after all, at Dresden, and not at Meissen, that the first\r\ntrue porcelain was made. It was not till the year 1710 that Böttger was\r\nagain removed to the old castle of Meissen, where the requisite secrecy\r\ncould be more effectually preserved.\r\n\r\nIn any case, in the year 1709 Böttger was able to show some specimens of\r\na true porcelain--somewhat yellowish in tint, indeed--to the royal\r\ncommissioner, and at the Leipsic Fair in 1710 not only was the red ware\r\noffered for sale for the first time, but a few specimens of the white\r\nporcelain were on view.\r\n\r\nSoon after this we find Böttger established in the Albrechtsburg at\r\nMeissen as administrator of the newly established porcelain works. Even\r\nnow he was little better than a prisoner, and in 1712 he requested the\r\nelector-king to allow him to resign. He was consoled, however, by a\r\nsubstantial present, and, so says one account, he was at the same time\r\nennobled--at any rate he was offered the title of Bergrath. But\r\nBöttger’s extravagant way of life led to his being constantly in need of\r\nmoney, and in the year 1716 he entertained proposals to sell his great\r\nsecret to a syndicate of Berlin merchants. In 1719, on the discovery of\r\nthis treachery, he was again imprisoned. In the same year Böttger died\r\nat the age of thirty-four. To the end, it would appear, he held out\r\nhopes to his master that he was on the way to success in his gold-making\r\nexperiments, and his brother-in-law, in a solemn memorial, asserted that\r\nhe was actually in the possession of the _lapis philosophorum_. How far\r\nBöttger, in making these claims, was playing a double game in order to\r\nobtain money from Augustus, it is impossible to say, but we must\r\nremember that at the same time Tschirnhaus, a man of culture and high\r\nintellectual attainments, was engaged in a search for the ‘universal\r\nmedicine.’\r\n\r\nThe red stoneware which was turned out already in 1708--it is now\r\ngenerally known as Böttger ware--resembles closely the boccaro imported\r\nat that time from China. Besides the red varieties, of two shades, there\r\nis a third kind, in which the surface, as it comes from the kiln, has\r\nbeen left untouched, and such pieces the Germans know as\r\n_Eisen-porzellan_. It is wonderful what a number of forms and\r\napplications Böttger was able to give to this stoneware during the short\r\nperiod during which it was produced. Of the red ware some of the\r\ncarefully modelled pieces were polished on the lapidary’s wheel. A\r\nchild’s head at South Kensington is a good specimen of this polished\r\nstoneware. In the Franks collection, now at Bethnal Green, is a\r\nremarkable series of the different varieties of Böttger ware. A tankard\r\nof polished marbled paste is marked with the year 1720, showing that the\r\nstoneware continued to be manufactured for some time alongside of the\r\ntrue white porcelain. _À propos_ of a beautiful little head of Apollo,\r\nwe are reminded in the catalogue that in 1711 there were sixty of these\r\n_Apollo-köpfe_ in stock. They were priced, unpolished, at nine groschen,\r\nor polished at sixteen. The difference, seven groschen, does not seem a\r\nhigh charge for the labour and skill involved in this polishing. In\r\nother cases the body is covered with a dark brown glaze, in which a\r\ndesign is traced in incised lines, brought out by gold. This glazed\r\nstoneware was afterwards imitated at Berlin and elsewhere in Germany.\r\nThere are some curious pieces at Dresden, which show that Böttger also\r\nattempted, not very successfully, to apply enamelled colours over his\r\ndark glazes.\r\n\r\nNot till the Easter Fair of 1713 was the white porcelain offered for\r\nsale at Leipsic, and even then the specimens on sale were far from\r\nfaultless. Only in the year 1716--in the interval a new description of\r\nwhite paste had been discovered--was the ware exhibited technically\r\nperfect.\r\n\r\nThus in the space of some eight years, Böttger had not only succeeded in\r\nmaking an excellent imitation of the Chinese boccaro ware, of which the\r\nspecial merit was to withstand rapid changes of temperature, but he had\r\nonce for all solved the great problem: he had produced a hard white\r\nporcelain, which has remained since that day the type for the whole of\r\nEurope.[153]\r\n\r\nWhere, we may ask, did Böttger acquire the technical knowledge and the\r\npractical experience, so essential in work of this kind? All the other\r\nmen who have made a name for themselves as breakers of new ground in the\r\nart of the potter--Palissy, Poterat, Wedgwood, and to these we may add\r\nthe great Chinese superintendents at King-te-chen and the Japanese\r\nartists Ninsei and Zengoro--were either working potters themselves or\r\ndirectors of large factories. What opportunities had this youth--he was\r\nonly sixteen when he came to Dresden, and already, it would seem, ‘well\r\nknown to the police’--of acquiring the practical details of the kilns,\r\nthe mixing vats, and the wheel?[154]\r\n\r\nSo again with regard to the materials he employed. Not much light has so\r\nfar been thrown on this point. We have a somewhat childish story about a\r\ncertain hair-powder--the _Schnorrische Erde_--which turned up at the\r\npsychological moment and solved the question once for all. But porcelain\r\nis not to be made from kaolin alone. That is only the skeleton, as the\r\nChinese say. We must find also the right kind of flesh to make the bones\r\nhang together. No mention, however, is made in the current narrative of\r\nany experiments on felspathic rocks. We know at least that this famous\r\n‘hair-powder’ was a very pure white kaolin, found at Aue, near\r\nSchneeberg, in the Erzgebirge, and that china-clay from this source was\r\nthe principal ingredient in the earliest porcelain produced. So in later\r\naccounts we find mention merely of different qualities of kaolin from\r\nAue, from Seilitz, and other sources.[155] A few years ago the Meissen\r\npaste, it is stated, was composed of kaolin from three different\r\nsources 72 per cent., of ‘felspar’ 26 per cent., and of old clay worked\r\nup again 2 per cent. In this and in most other cases where felspar is\r\nmentioned as a constituent of a porcelain paste, we must probably\r\nunderstand some kind of petuntse or china-stone containing quartz and\r\nperhaps other minerals in addition to the felspar. The following figures\r\nshow the composition of the paste at the beginning of the last century:\r\nsilica 59 per cent., alumina 36 per cent., and potash 3 per cent. The\r\nglaze was at that time composed of calcined quartz 37 per cent., Seilitz\r\nkaolin 37 per cent., limestone 17·5 per cent., and porcelain pot-sherds\r\n8·5 per cent. From this it will be seen that the Meissen porcelain is of\r\na somewhat ‘severe’ type. To judge from its composition it must require\r\na high temperature in firing; on the other hand, the paste should\r\npossess considerable plastic qualities. The absence of lime from the\r\npaste and its presence in considerable quantity in the glaze is a point\r\nof interest. In this, the Saxon ware resembles the porcelain that is\r\nmade in the Owari district of Japan. At Sèvres, on the other hand, we\r\nshall see that the glaze of the hard porcelain contains no lime, while\r\nthat substance is an essential constituent in the paste.\r\n\r\nThe Meissen porcelain, and indeed the German porcelains generally, form\r\na typically hard and refractory group. But they have in a full measure\r\n_les défauts de leurs qualités_. Among them we may look in vain for that\r\nblending of the glaze and body that gives to the best Chinese porcelain\r\na surface like that of polished marble; still less do we find in the\r\nenamel decoration the brilliancy and transparence of Oriental wares. In\r\nplace of this we see a chalky surface of a cold, neutral tone, over\r\nwhich is painted, in dull opaque tints, elaborately executed pictures\r\nthat look often as if they had been _stuck on_ as an afterthought.\r\nApart from the influence of the taste of the time, and the general\r\nabsence of the colour sense among the German race, this dulness and\r\nopacity is the result of the high temperature required in the\r\nmuffle-stove to enable the coloured enamels to adhere to the refractory\r\nglaze beneath them. As a consequence of this the choice of colours is\r\nlimited, and even the enamels that are available never become thoroughly\r\nincorporated with the glaze.\r\n\r\nTo return to the porcelain made by Böttger in the few remaining years of\r\nhis life, it is surprising in what a number of directions we find him\r\nmaking experiments; for indeed all the many varieties of porcelain made\r\nduring his lifetime may be classed together as experimental. It is only\r\nin the museum at Dresden that we can study this interesting period. The\r\nmoulds that had been used for the red stoneware served at first for the\r\nnew porcelain. The ornaments in relief were modelled by hand and laid on\r\nthe surface. Böttger attempted at one time to replace the enamel\r\ncolours, so difficult to use with effect, by employing a kind of lacquer\r\nor mastic as a vehicle. His greatest triumph in this department was the\r\nso-called mother-of-pearl glaze, a thin wash of rosy purple with a\r\nslight lustre,[156] and this he combined with a free use of metallic\r\ngold and silver. The plain white of the Chinese was copied closely, but\r\nthe early attempts at the decoration with blue _sous couverte_ were\r\nstrikingly unsuccessful. The larger pieces made at this, and even later\r\ntimes, have generally suffered from overfiring or from imperfect support\r\nin the kiln, and would now be regarded as ‘wasters.’\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Böttger in 1719 there follows an intermediate period,\r\nstill in a measure experimental, during which the factory was under the\r\ncharge of four\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PLATE XXXI._ MEISSEN, COLOURED ENAMELS]\r\n\r\ncommissioners. The blue and white of the Chinese was imitated, but not\r\nvery skilfully. They were more successful with the _café au lait_ glaze,\r\nwhich at that time was in great favour.\r\n\r\nIt is to the Viennese painter, Johann Gregorius Herold, or Höroldt (_b._\r\n1696; 1720-65 at Meissen), that the credit must be given of establishing\r\na definite school of decoration. He began, however, with the imitation\r\nof Oriental designs. At this time the Japanese Kakiyemon ware (both the\r\npaste and the pattern) was closely copied. The blue and white with\r\nChinese designs was at length more successful, and now the _poudré_ blue\r\nand other monochrome grounds of the Chinese were also imitated. On the\r\nother hand, to this time (1730-40) also belong the earliest armorial\r\ndinner-services--those with the arms of Saxony and Poland for the\r\nelectoral court, and more than one set with the arms of the Count Brühl\r\nfor that pomp-loving nobleman.[157]\r\n\r\nA new direction was given to the manufacture soon after the appointment\r\n(in 1731) of Johann Joachim Kändler (1706-1775) to the place of chief\r\nmodeller. He it was that, abandoning the clumsy imitations of Chinese\r\ngods and monsters, first recognised the capabilities of porcelain as a\r\nmaterial for those little statuettes and groups of figures that we have\r\nsince that time come to associate above all else with the European\r\nporcelain of the eighteenth century, and especially with that of\r\nGermany. The subjects were taken partly from the social life of the day.\r\nIn part also they carried on the tradition of the ‘Italian comedy’ and\r\nof the conventional pastoral life that we find in the French art of a\r\nsomewhat earlier date. The pictures of Watteau and Lancret were much\r\nsought after at that time by the princely collectors in Germany, and a\r\nfew choice works of these artists, as well as many somewhat muddy\r\ncopies and imitations of native origin, may be seen in the gallery at\r\nDresden.\r\n\r\nThe plastic qualities and the infusibility of the paste, together with\r\nthe thinness of the coat of glaze, enabled the artist to obtain a\r\nclearer and sharper reproduction of his model than was ever possible\r\nwith the soft pastes and the thick lead glazes of the English\r\nimitations.[158] The best of these little figures, however, belong to\r\nrather later times, for during the last years of Augustus the Strong\r\n(he died in 1733) Kändler was occupied with more ambitious\r\ncommissions--life-sized figures of the twelve apostles, an equestrian\r\nstatue of the king, and figures of animals, to decorate the new rooms of\r\nthe Japanese palace. But these attempts to employ porcelain as a\r\nmaterial for monumental sculpture (in the style of Bernini) ended in\r\nfailure. There is at South Kensington a series of figures in plain\r\nwhite, dating from this period, apparently destined to form part of a\r\nsmall fountain, and from these a very good idea of this application of\r\nthe ware can be formed.\r\n\r\nIt was about this time, or a little earlier, that the passion for\r\nporcelain flowers, generally in plain white ware, spread through Europe.\r\nThese or similar ornaments were even fastened to ladies’\r\ndresses,--witness the _gros papillons en porcelaine de Saxe_, which we\r\nhear of as sewed on to the state-dress of a French _marquise_. This was\r\nthe ware that it paid best to manufacture, both here and at Saint-Cloud\r\nand Vincennes. Porcelain flowers were applied at a later time to the\r\nwhole surface of a vase. These ‘Schneeballen vasen,’ as they are called\r\nin Germany, were even reproduced at King-te-chen for exportation to\r\nEurope.[159]\r\n\r\nWith the employment of professional artists--flower-painters,\r\nlandscape-painters, and painters of _genre_ scenes--to adorn the surface\r\nof the already glazed ware with miniature pictures, a style of\r\ndecoration came in, if decoration it can be called, which became more\r\nand more the dominant note of European porcelain during the next hundred\r\nyears. The flower-painter came first with realistic, well-shaded little\r\nnosegays, in the style of the Dutch painters of the day; then\r\nlandscapes, views of real towns, sometimes in a purple-red monochrome,\r\nand surrounded by a gold rococo frame to imitate that of an oil picture.\r\nThe free use of gold, however, in the European porcelain of this time,\r\nwas to some extent a saving point. It helped, as gold always does, to\r\npull together the decoration. On the earlier Meissen ware the gold is\r\nmost solidly applied and has worn well.\r\n\r\nThe palmy days of the Meissen factory, when seven hundred workmen were\r\nemployed and large profits made, came to an end with the Seven Years’\r\nWar. Frederick, in 1759 and again in 1761, looted the Albrechtsburg and\r\ncarried away to Berlin the models and moulds as well as many choice\r\npieces of porcelain. The rest of the stock was sold by auction, and the\r\narchives of the works were at the same time destroyed.\r\n\r\nIt was about this time that the most violent of the several porcelain\r\nfevers that distinguished the eighteenth century was raging, and the\r\nperiod of the Seven Years’ War may be regarded as the culminating epoch\r\nin the history of European porcelain. Both at Sèvres, and with us in\r\nEngland, this is certainly the case. But at Meissen the best had already\r\nbeen produced; the _vieille saxe_ of our ancestors is a product of an\r\nearlier period--the thirties, the forties, and the early fifties. During\r\nthe decade succeeding the close of the war there was little falling off\r\nin France and England. At Meissen, however, there now followed a period\r\nof decline both artistic and financial. We find a ‘professor of\r\npainting,’ one Dietrich, at the head of a ‘school of design,’ and he\r\nseems to have been the most prominent man associated with the works at\r\nthe time. Such an association is a sure sign of the wrong direction now\r\nbeing given to the manufacture. There was some fitful revival later in\r\nthe century, after the appointment of Count Marcolini to the direction.\r\nHe was an active minister of the last elector and first king of\r\nSaxony--Frederick Augustus the Just--and he held the post of director at\r\nMeissen for more than forty years (1774-1815). Marcolini’s name is\r\nassociated with certain changes of style which in the main reflected the\r\nvarious phases of a taste, or rather fashion, which took its watchword\r\nfrom Paris.\r\n\r\nThere are indeed two main divisions of this later period: during the\r\nfirst, sentimental _motifs_ and an affectation of domestic simplicity\r\nprevailed; the second period was more especially the time when classical\r\nmodels were followed, and it culminated in the _Empire_ style. The first\r\nphase is represented in Saxony by the works of the French sculptor\r\nAcier; in the later classical time the fashion came in of copying\r\nantique sculpture in white biscuit.\r\n\r\nThe Marcolini period is the last that has any interest for us. It was\r\ncommercially at least a time of decline. It is said that Josiah\r\nWedgwood, when he visited the factory at Meissen in the year 1790,\r\noffered to run it as a speculation of his own, paying a rental of £3000\r\nto the king. The marvel is that the manufacture survived the troubles\r\nof the Napoleonic wars when Saxony suffered so much.\r\n\r\nDuring the nineteenth century Meissen has followed more or less in the\r\nwake of Sèvres. Huge pieces were produced for presentation, heavily\r\npainted with copies of famous pictures in the Dresden Gallery, or\r\nadorned with frieze-like bands in monochrome, in imitation of ancient\r\nsculpture. During the same time, imitations of the _vieille saxe_, the\r\nmarks included, were made with some success, and much cheap ware has\r\nbeen manufactured for the market, so that commercially the Meissen works\r\nhave for some time had a flourishing career. The change that has come\r\nover Sèvres of late, the search after new methods, both in the\r\ncomposition of the paste and in the decoration, has not, I think, been\r\nreflected to any extent at Meissen, nor has the scientific side of the\r\npotter’s art been illustrated by any works such as those of Brongniart\r\nand Salvétat. Indeed the old traditions of secrecy have been maintained\r\nin a measure up to the present day. It was only in 1863 that the\r\nporcelain factory was removed from the castle rock at Meissen, where it\r\nhad been carried on for a century and a half, to a more roomy and\r\nconvenient position in the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nThe well-known mark of the two swords (PL. C. 27) cannot be traced by\r\nmeans of dated specimens further back than the year 1726. This mark had\r\nits origin in the privilege claimed by the Saxon electors of carrying\r\nthe two imperial swords before the Emperor at his coronation. On the\r\nearliest pieces we find either the letters A. R. in blue (PL. C. 26), or\r\nelse a roughly painted caduceus, or rather rod of Æsculapius (PL. C.\r\n25), the first on ware for court use, the second on that made for the\r\nmarket. An incised mark cut with the wheel across the two swords is said\r\nto indicate the ware that was sold undecorated, generally pieces with\r\nsome slight defect. We may note that a similar practice was at one time\r\nin use at Sèvres. The addition of a star to the swords indicates the\r\nMarcolini period. These eighteenth century marks, however, were copied\r\nnot only in England and by private firms in Germany, but also on the\r\nimitation of the _vieille saxe_ made in the last century at the royal\r\nworks at Meissen, so that their presence on a piece of china is of\r\nlittle value in identifying the date or place of origin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nTHE HARD-PASTE PORCELAIN OF GERMANY--(_continued_).\r\n\r\nVIENNA--BERLIN--HÖCHST--FÜRSTENBERG--LUDWIGSBURG--\r\nNYMPHENBURG--FRANKENTHAL--FULDA--STRASSBURG.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HARD AND SOFT PASTES OF SWITZERLAND, HUNGARY, HOLLAND, SWEDEN,\r\nDENMARK, AND RUSSIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn spite of the elaborate precautions that were taken--the oaths of\r\nsecrecy, the military guards that accompanied the relays of china-clay\r\nto the fortress at Meissen in which the works were established--by the\r\nmiddle of the eighteenth century, at nearly all the courts of Germany,\r\nimperial, royal, or serene, we find a porcelain manufactory already in\r\nfull work. It was the fashion of the day, and took its place, like the\r\nopera company or the stud, in the equipment of an up-to-date\r\n_Residenz-Stadt_. Only one or two of these princely factories survived\r\nthe time of turmoil at the end of the century and the Napoleonic\r\ninvasions. In no single one of the works can we find that any fresh line\r\nwas struck out or any important improvement made either in technique or\r\nin design. The products of these different factories are often to be\r\ndistinguished only by the marks they bear, and these marks are as often\r\nas not forgeries. We shall therefore confine ourselves to a somewhat\r\nsummary description, pointing out especially the relations of the\r\ndifferent centres to one another. The starting of a new manufactory\r\ngenerally depended upon the successful bribing of some official or\r\nforeman of works: at the beginning such aid was sought from Meissen,\r\nbut later on the assistance came from Vienna or from Höchst, so that on\r\nthis ground the relation of the works to one another might be\r\nrepresented by a rough kind of genealogical tree.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIENNA.--The beginnings of the factory at Vienna were humble. Claude du\r\nPaquier, a Dutch adventurer, took out a patent for making porcelain in\r\n1718, and with the aid of an enameller and gilder from Meissen, one\r\nHunger, a man with some knowledge of chemistry, carried on the work on a\r\nmodest scale, until in 1744 his factory and his secrets were bought by\r\nMaria Theresa for 45,000 gulden. The Viennese porcelain was henceforth,\r\nuntil the extinction of the industry in 1864, marked with the Hapsburg\r\nshield, generally in blue, under the glaze (PL. C. 28), with the\r\naddition, after 1784, of a contracted year-mark.\r\n\r\nSo long as the kaolin from Passau was employed the paste was inferior to\r\nthat of Meissen and Berlin, but in later days a better material was\r\nobtained from Bohemia. The most flourishing period was from 1770 to\r\n1790, and in 1780, we are told, there were three hundred and twenty men\r\nemployed. In early years the porcelain did not differ much from that of\r\nDresden, but in 1784, when Conrad von Sorgenthal became director, a new\r\nstyle was introduced which has made the Viennese in some respects the\r\ntypical ware of a bad period. Much attention was paid to the gilding and\r\nto the pigments employed, and the surface of the porcelain was covered\r\nby an elaborate and often gaudy decoration. We are, however, informed by\r\nan eminent German authority that ‘from 1785 to 1815 the Viennese\r\nporcelain among all the manufactures of the time took, from an artistic\r\npoint of view, the highest rank’ (Jaennicke, _Keramic_, Stuttgart,\r\n1879). It is in any case remarkable that, during a period of disastrous\r\nwar and foreign occupation, so much bad porcelain and good music should\r\nhave been produced at Vienna. It was at this time that the chemist\r\nLeithner obtained, for the first time, an intense black from uranium and\r\nperfected the process by which platinum is applied in low relief.\r\n\r\nTo the same chemist we must also attribute another speciality of the\r\nViennese porcelain of this time,--the decoration with designs in\r\npolished gold upon a dead ground of the same metal. There are some\r\nelaborately decorated plates at South Kensington which well illustrate\r\nthe merits or demerits of this ware. In spite of the early foundation of\r\nthe factory, the Viennese porcelain, as a whole, falls into the later\r\n‘sentimental to classical’ period, that contemporary with Marcolini at\r\nMeissen and with the earlier hard paste of Sèvres. The historical\r\ndevelopment of the ware is well illustrated in the Industrial Museum at\r\nVienna, and it may be acknowledged that some success was obtained with\r\nsmall figures and even life-sized busts. A good deal of cheap and\r\nmeretricious stuff made in the numerous private kilns in and around\r\nVienna in the latter half of the nineteenth century has lately found its\r\nway into the English market.\r\n\r\n\r\nBERLIN.--The porcelain of Berlin is of some interest to us for two\r\nreasons, one historical and the other of a technical nature. On the one\r\nhand it was thanks to the fostering care of the great Frederick that the\r\nfactory first assumed any importance, and on the other it was the great\r\nattention given in later days to choice of materials (together with the\r\nrefractory nature of the paste) that led to this pure white ware being\r\nemployed above all others in the laboratory of the chemist. As at\r\nVienna, the origin of the works was humble, and in this case one perhaps\r\nmight even say ‘shady,’ if we are to believe the story that it was the\r\nworkmen who had stolen from the pocket of Ringler, the arcanist of\r\nHöchst, the papers containing his recipes and private notes, who were\r\nengaged in 1750 by the merchant Wegeli, the first to set up a kiln for\r\nporcelain at Berlin.[160]\r\n\r\nThe ware that Wegeli made is not important. We find little figures and\r\ngroups in imitation of Kändler as well as cups and teapots decorated in\r\nblue, _sous couverte_, with little sprigs; his mark, a W., has\r\nunfortunately been used at other factories. It was indeed rather the\r\nbanker Gotzkowski who was the practical founder of the Berlin works, for\r\nWegeli had abandoned his enterprise at the commencement of the Seven\r\nYears’ War.\r\n\r\nGerman writers are not agreed as to what share should be given to the\r\nking in the removal of the staff and workmen of the Meissen works to\r\nBerlin in 1761. Frederick at that time was hard pressed by his enemies\r\nand in great want of money; in the letter, quoted below, he writes that\r\nhe has nothing left but his honour, his coat, his sword, and _his\r\nporcelain_. He has been accused of forcibly removing to Berlin, not only\r\nthe workmen, but the artists also and other members of the staff at\r\nMeissen. On the other hand, it is claimed that the removal was\r\nvoluntary, and brought about by the offers of good pay made by\r\nGotzkowski. Frederick at that time had other things to do,[161] and it\r\nwas not till the close of the war in 1763 that he purchased\r\nGotzkowski’s new works for a large sum. He now had leisure to take a\r\npersonal interest in the manufacture. About this time the kaolin which\r\nhad been previously brought from Passau, in Bavaria, was obtained, of\r\nbetter quality, from the quarries near Halle which still supply the\r\nBerlin works. The sale of the porcelain was forced with true Prussian\r\nenergy: its purchase was obligatory for lottery prizes, to the amount of\r\n10,000 thalers every year, and no Jew could obtain a marriage\r\ncertificate except on the production of the receipt for the purchase of\r\na service of porcelain. It is for this reason that the Berlin ware is in\r\nGermany sometimes known as _Juden porcellan_. Grieninger, a Saxon, was\r\nthe practical manager of the works from the time of their foundation by\r\nGotzkowski to the end of the century. During this period the porcelain\r\nproduced differed little from that previously made at Meissen. A shade\r\nof pink, derived from the purple of Cassius, was much admired by\r\nFrederick, and forms the _pendant_ to the famous rose-colour of his\r\nbitter enemy, Madame de Pompadour.\r\n\r\nThe changes made after this time were chiefly of a practical nature. The\r\nhorizontal furnaces were early replaced by the cylindrical type now\r\ngenerally in use in Europe, and as long ago as 1799 steam power was\r\nemployed in the preparation of the materials. The chemist, above all,\r\nhas at all times played an important part at Berlin.\r\n\r\nMany strange applications of porcelain, some more curious than really\r\nbeautiful, were introduced about the beginning of the nineteenth\r\ncentury. A close imitation of lace and _tulle_, made by dipping into a\r\nspecially prepared slip a real tissue which was afterwards burned away,\r\nwas a nine days’ wonder when first introduced. (A veiled bust in white\r\nbiscuit of Queen Louise of Prussia, now at Dresden, is perhaps the most\r\nfamous example of this ware.) Another application of porcelain was to\r\nthe ‘transparencies’ or _lithophanie_, in which the design, as seen by\r\ntransmitted light, was given by variations in the thickness of the\r\npaste.\r\n\r\nThe only mark of interest on the porcelain of Berlin is the sceptre (PL.\r\nC. 31), the prized ensign that the electors of Brandenburg bore on their\r\nshield as an emblem of their position as Arch-Chamberlains of the Holy\r\nRoman Empire.[162] It was this sceptre (very slightly indicated on the\r\nearlier examples, and resembling, perhaps intentionally, the Saxon mark)\r\nthat the Prince de Ligne observing on his plate, when dining with the\r\nking, affected to take for a sword, and made the occasion of a\r\n‘two-edged’ compliment.\r\n\r\n\r\nHÖCHST.--The fayence of Höchst, a town lying between Frankfort and\r\nMainz, had acquired some reputation early in the eighteenth century, and\r\nalready, by the year 1720, one of the manufacturers, Göltz, had\r\nattempted to make porcelain. But not until he had obtained the\r\nassistance of a runaway workman or ‘arcanist’ from Vienna, one Ringler\r\n(a name which occurs over and over again in similar connections--see\r\nnote, p. 262), was anything of importance accomplished.[163] The kilns\r\nwere now rebuilt on the Viennese model, and by the year 1746 porcelain\r\nof good quality was produced. The works had already received many\r\nprivileges from the local prince, in this case the archbishop-elector of\r\nMainz, and about 1778 (or perhaps earlier) the whole establishment was\r\npurchased by him. This prince was a patron of art and fond of display,\r\nso that during his day the manufacture was conducted on a non-commercial\r\nbasis. The chief claim to attention of the ware made at Höchst depends\r\nupon the little lifelike figures that were modelled by a clever sculptor\r\nwho worked there from 1768 or 1770 to 1780. The work of this Johann\r\nPeter Melchior, who survived till 1825, is preferred by some collectors\r\nto anything made at Meissen. He migrated late in life first to\r\nFrankenthal, and then to Nymphenburg. The wooden models from which he\r\nworked are now much sought after in Germany. It is stated that the\r\nkaolin used at Höchst was obtained from Limoges, but this can only apply\r\nto a comparatively late period. The works came to an end with the\r\ninvasion of the French in 1794. The mark, a six-spoked wheel, sometimes\r\nsurmounted by a crown (Pl. c. 29), is derived from the arms of the\r\narch-episcopal see of Mainz,--indeed the Höchst ware is sometimes known\r\nas _porcelaine de Mayence_.\r\n\r\n\r\nFÜRSTENBERG.--The Duke Karl of Brunswick was one of the earliest German\r\nprinces to establish a porcelain factory; this was at the castle of\r\nFürstenberg, on the Weser. The works were organised about 1746 by the\r\nBaron von Langen, who was something of an arcanist; and from Höchst, in\r\n1750, the assistance of an experienced potter, one Bengraf, was\r\nobtained. Bengraf had to escape by stealth from Höchst, where he had\r\nbeen in the employ of Göltz, and reached Fürstenberg after many\r\nsufferings and privations. A point of interest in connection with the\r\nporcelain made at a later time at this factory is that flour-spar\r\n(fluoride of calcium) has formed an important element in the composition\r\nof the glaze. In the Museum at Brunswick may be seen more than eight\r\nhundred specimens of this porcelain, and any want of originality is made\r\nup for by the extraordinary variety and number of the different wares\r\nthat have been copied. It is not perhaps surprising, in view of the\r\nclose family ties existing between the dukes and our second and third\r\nGeorges, to find copies of our English soft pastes, especially of\r\nChelsea. The clarets and maroons of this latter ware were imitated with\r\nsome success. A landscape-painter of some local fame, whose works may be\r\nseen in the gallery at Brunswick, one Pascha Weitsch, was employed to\r\npaint views on this porcelain, and good portrait-busts--of Lavater and\r\nof Raphael Mengs, among others--may be found in the adjacent museum. The\r\nfactory has continued in operation up to quite recent times. The\r\nFürstenberg mark, a large F in a flowing hand (PL. C. 30), may be\r\nobserved not unfrequently on china in old collections in England. There\r\nwas more than one specimen at Strawberry Hill.\r\n\r\n\r\nLUDWIGSBURG.--We now come again upon the arcanist Ringler. In 1758 he\r\nwas tempted away from Höchst by the Duke Karl Eugen of Würtemberg, and\r\nplaced at the head of a manufactory of porcelain which had lately been\r\nestablished at Ludwigsburg, the Versailles or Potsdam of the dukes,\r\nsituated some nine miles to the north of Stuttgart. The paste of this\r\nware is not remarkable for purity of tint, and I do not know whether we\r\nare to believe the statement that the materials came in part from\r\nFrance. The enamel painting is distinguished by its high finish; on the\r\ngala services made for the court, among wreaths of flowers in low relief\r\nwe find carefully painted beetles and butterflies. The little, highly\r\nfinished statuettes and groups are of some merit. In the Museum of\r\nNational Antiquities at Stuttgart is now to be seen an extensive\r\ncollection of porcelain, purchased in 1875 from Herr Murschel, and here\r\nthe Ludwigsburg ware can be well studied. The shield of Würtemberg,\r\nwith\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PLATE XXXII._ 1. MEISSEN. 2. LUDWIGSBURG.]\r\n\r\nits three pairs of antlers, is sometimes found on this ware (PL. C. 35),\r\nbut more often the initials of the reigning duke--or (after 1806)\r\nking--with or without a crown (PL. C. 36). It is this last mark that has\r\nprobably given rise to the absurd name of Kronenburg by which this ware\r\nis sometimes known among dealers. Soon after 1775, when the dukes\r\nabandoned Ludwigsburg as a place of residence, the factory declined in\r\nimportance, but the manufacture lingered on till the year 1824.\r\n\r\n\r\nNYMPHENBURG.--About the middle of the eighteenth century the electoral\r\nprince, Max Joseph, established some works at Neudeck, on the Au, in\r\nducal Bavaria, and this factory, it is said, was visited and reorganised\r\nby the ubiquitous Ringler in 1756. In 1758, however, the manufactory was\r\nremoved to the summer residence of Nymphenburg, near Munich. Heintzmann\r\npainted landscapes, and other artists copied famous pictures from the\r\nMunich Gallery, on the fine white ground of this porcelain. The\r\nelector-palatine inherited the ducal territory in 1778, and hither, in\r\n1799, came many workmen from Frankenthal when the palatinate was invaded\r\nby the French. This ware is best represented in the National Museum at\r\nMunich. The works are still carried on, but they are now in private\r\nhands. The Nymphenburg porcelain may generally be recognised by the\r\nshield of Bavaria, ‘fusilly’ (PL. C. 35), but this shield takes various\r\nforms and the mark is often very small.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANKENTHAL.--Somewhat more interest attaches to the porcelain made at\r\nFrankenthal, a town of the palatinate, not far from Mannheim, if only\r\nbecause at its foundation we are brought into connection not only with\r\nthe earlier German works, but at the same time, indirectly, it is true,\r\nwith Sèvres. Here, according to one account, came Ringler, in 1751,\r\nleaving Höchst in disgust, after he had been robbed of his papers and of\r\nhis secrets. At any rate, a few years later, in 1755, Paul Antoine\r\nHannong, a member of a famous family of potters at Strassburg, was\r\ngranted a privilege to found here a factory of porcelain. Hannong had\r\ngraduated as a porcelain arcanist, and had already fruitlessly\r\nendeavoured to sell his secrets to the authorities at Vincennes. As the\r\nroyal porcelain works, on their removal to Sèvres, now began to claim\r\nthe monopoly for the whole of France, Hannong was not allowed to set up\r\nhis kilns at Strassburg.\r\n\r\nThe electoral prince Karl Theodor bought the works at Frankenthal in\r\n1761, and devoted himself to obtaining the best artists (Melchior, among\r\nothers, was brought from Höchst) and most skilful potters, so that for a\r\nfew years the porcelain here produced was in its way as good as any made\r\nin Germany--indeed it was attempted to rival the contemporary work of\r\nSèvres in the delicacy of the painting and the brilliancy of the\r\ngilding. This ware is always to be associated with the Elector Karl\r\nTheodor, and its glory came to an end when, in 1778, he abandoned the\r\npalatinate on becoming elector of ducal Bavaria. The factory, however,\r\nwas not finally closed till about 1800. The most usual mark is the\r\nlion-rampant crowned, from the arms of the palatinate (PL. C. 32); the\r\ninitials of Karl Theodor are also found surmounted by a crown (PL. C.\r\n33). There is a curious plate of this ware in the Franks collection; it\r\nbears a Latin inscription (containing a chronogram for 1775) which\r\nstates that all the various colours and gilding used at the works are\r\nmade use of in the decoration.\r\n\r\n\r\nFULDA.--Porcelain was probably made at Fulda as early as the year 1741,\r\nbut it was only in 1763, or perhaps even later, that the prince-bishop\r\nset up the ‘_Fürstliche Fuldaische feine Porzellan-Fabrik_’ close by\r\nhis palace. The daintily modelled and carefully finished ware here made,\r\nmarked with a double F or by a cross (PL. C. 37 and 38), is seen\r\noccasionally in English collections. The fireclay as well as the\r\nbeechwood for his kilns was obtained from the adjacent volcanic hills of\r\nthe Hohe Rhön. As not only the bishop himself but the canons of the\r\nchurch also availed themselves somewhat freely of their privilege of\r\nappropriating whatever pleased them, as presents to their friends, a\r\nheavy loss was incurred, and the works were closed soon after the death\r\nof the founder.\r\n\r\nPorcelain was also made during the latter half of the eighteenth century\r\nat Gotha and several other places in the neighbourhood of the Thüringer\r\nWald. There are specimens of the ware made at many of these kilns--at\r\nKloster Veilsdorf, at Wallendorf, at Gross Breitenbach, Limbach, Gera,\r\nand especially at Gotha--in the Franks collection of continental\r\nporcelain. A good deal of common porcelain for table use is still made\r\nat scattered factories in this district.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRASSBURG.--Without committing oneself to any political _parti-pris_,\r\nwe may conveniently say a word of the ceramic history of Strassburg at\r\nthis point, although in the eighteenth century the town already belonged\r\nto France.[164] The Hannong family had here from the beginning of the\r\neighteenth century been making fayence, and this family is of interest\r\nto us as forming a link between the porcelain of Germany and that of\r\nFrance. Charles François Hannong, probably with the assistance of a\r\nGerman arcanist, attempted the manufacture of hard porcelain as early as\r\n1721. It was his son Paul Antoine who first entered into negotiations\r\nwith the French for the sale of the secret of making hard porcelain.\r\nThis was in 1753. Not only did these negotiations come to nothing, but,\r\nas we have already mentioned, Hannong was hampered in his attempts to\r\nestablish a porcelain factory in his native town. In 1755 we find him\r\nwith the elector-palatine at Frankenthal. After his death in 1760, the\r\nfactory at Strassburg was carried on for a time by his son, Pierre\r\nAntoine, but in 1766 the latter went to France and started a factory\r\nfirst at Vincennes, and later in the Faubourg St. Lazare, under the\r\npatronage of the Comte d’Artois. Later still we find him employed at the\r\nVinovo works in Piedmont. His eldest son, Joseph Adam Hannong, struggled\r\non for some time at Strassburg under the protection of the local\r\nmagnate, the Cardinal de Rohan. Thus for more than sixty years four\r\ngenerations of this family played a prominent part in the dissemination\r\nof the knowledge of hard porcelain in Europe, although the actual wares\r\nmade by them are of little importance.[165]\r\n\r\nThe factory at the adjacent town of Niderwiller appears to have derived\r\nits inspiration directly from Meissen. Porcelain was here made from\r\nGerman clay as early as the sixties. At a later time the works belonged\r\nto the Comte de Custine, and some well modelled biscuit figures, the\r\nclay for which was obtained from Limoges, were then turned out.\r\n\r\n\r\nSWITZERLAND.--A good deal of porcelain was made in the eighteenth\r\ncentury both at Zurich and at Nyon, on the Lake of Geneva. The various\r\nwares are well represented in several of the local Swiss museums.\r\n\r\nThe porcelain of ZURICH belongs essentially to the Saxon group. The\r\nhard, greyish or dead-white paste, and the flowers or landscapes\r\ncarefully painted in opaque colours, point at once to the origin of the\r\nware. The factory was established as early as 1763, with the assistance\r\nof an arcanist, one Spengler, from Höchst. The Swiss poet, Solomon\r\nGessner, took a great interest in the works, himself painting landscapes\r\non several pieces. From Ludwigsburg also came Sonnenschein, to model\r\nsome clever and lifelike figures. A coral-coloured ware made at this\r\ntime was much admired. The Zurich factory did not long survive the\r\nFrench invasion: it was closed in 1803. This porcelain is marked in blue\r\nunder the glaze with a capital Z of German form (PL. D. 49).\r\n\r\nAt NYON, on the other hand, the influence came from Sèvres, in later\r\ntimes at least, for on the earlier specimens the tulips, birds, and\r\nlandscapes are of a Saxon type. The white ware, _semé de\r\nfleurettes_--blue violets and roses--is perhaps the most characteristic.\r\nThere were probably two factories here at the end of the eighteenth\r\ncentury. Of these the better known one was established by Maubrée, a\r\nflower painter from Sèvres, to whom is attributed the porcelain marked\r\nwith a hastily sketched fish in blue (PL. D. 50). Some of the Nyon\r\nporcelain was decorated at Geneva, and at a later date we find more than\r\none artist of the latter town holding an important position at Sèvres;\r\nindeed under Charles X., a Genevese, Abraham Constantin, who copied the\r\npictures of Raphael on porcelain, was director of the art school\r\nattached to the royal factory.\r\n\r\n\r\nHUNGARY.--A factory was established by Moritz Fischer at Herend, in\r\nHungary, early in the nineteenth century. The porcelain of Herend is of\r\nespecial interest to us, for Fischer appears to have mastered the\r\nproblem of producing the brilliant and jewel-like enamels of the\r\nChinese. Some of his imitations of the _famille rose_ are excellent. He\r\nappears to have devoted himself to making coffee-cups and other small\r\nobjects for the Turkish market. There is an interesting collection of\r\nhis ware at South Kensington. The _rouge d’or_, the green and even the\r\nblack grounds of the Chinese are well imitated, but the blue, _sous\r\ncouverte_, and the iron red are not so successful. He also imitated the\r\nporcelain of Sèvres and Capo di Monte. Fischer stamped his ware with the\r\nword Herend in very small characters, and the Hungarian coat of arms is\r\nsometimes added over the glaze (PL. C. 39).\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt the time of the great porcelain fever of the eighteenth century, of\r\nwhich the culminating period may be held to be coincident with the Seven\r\nYears’ War (1756-63), the North of Europe--Holland, Denmark, and\r\nRussia--formed part of the great province that had its metropolis at\r\nMeissen, while the southern countries--Spain and Italy (in part)--may be\r\nsaid to have looked to Sèvres for their inspiration. As for England, its\r\nallegiance was divided, but at the beginning, and certainly during the\r\nbest period, the French influence was predominant; and later on, as\r\nregards the materials at least, we struck out a line of our own.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOLLAND.--There is little of novelty or originality to be found in the\r\nhard-paste porcelain made at this time in the North of Europe. The great\r\ndays of Dutch art were over long before the introduction of porcelain\r\ninto Holland, and the little that was then made fell readily into the\r\nSaxon school of decoration. Somewhere about 1760 the Count of Gronsfeld\r\nDiepenbroik established some of the Meissen workmen at Weesp. The mark\r\non this early ware is doubtless derived from the Saxon swords (PL. C.\r\n40). Later, when removed to OUDE LOOSDRECHT, the works were under the\r\nsuperintendence of a Calvinist _pastor_--his name is given as Moll. The\r\nmark on his porcelain, however, M. O. L., certainly referred in the\r\nfirst place to the place of manufacture (PL. C. 41). On the death of\r\nthe reverend director in 1782 the factory was removed to Amsterdam,\r\nwhere the porcelain known generally as OUDE AMSTEL--a name that is often\r\nmade to include the other Dutch porcelain of the time--was manufactured.\r\n\r\nAt THE HAGUE, in 1778, a company was formed to make porcelain. This was\r\nunder the patronage of the local magnates. They obtained the assistance\r\nof German workmen, and took the well-known badge of their town--a stork\r\nholding a fish in its mouth--as a mark (PL. C. 42). This was painted in\r\nblue _under the glaze_--for the native porcelain at least. In the case\r\nof the foreign white ware, much of which was decorated here--the soft\r\npaste of Tournai especially--the mark was painted _over the glaze_. The\r\nsomewhat heavily decorated porcelain of the Hague, painted with\r\nlandscapes, sea-pieces, and flowers, is now much sought after by the\r\nDutch. At the time, however, the competition of both Oriental and German\r\nporcelain, of the enamelled fayence of Delft and later of the English\r\nwares, left little place in Holland for a native porcelain.\r\n\r\n\r\nSWEDEN.--The fayence and soft-paste porcelain made at Marieberg and at\r\nRörstrand--both places in the neighbourhood of Stockholm--received their\r\ninspiration from Delft and Sèvres (or rather perhaps from Mennecy)\r\nrespectively. Some hard paste was also made at Marieberg about 1780. The\r\nrare specimens of this ware are of considerable artistic merit. Of the\r\nsoft-paste Swedish porcelain there are some custard-cups, closely\r\nimitating the Mennecy ware, both at South Kensington and in the Franks\r\ncollection. The hard porcelain (and also, it is said, a ware that\r\nappears to be of a hybrid paste) bears as a mark the three crowns of the\r\nhouse of Vasa (PL. C. 44).\r\n\r\n\r\nDENMARK.--At Copenhagen there were some early attempts at a soft paste\r\nmade by a Frenchman named Fournier about 1760.[166] The mark--F. 5.--on\r\nthis ware refers to Frederick V., the reigning king. But the famous\r\nfactory of hard-paste porcelain, that has of late years shown so much\r\nenterprise and originality,[167] was founded in 1772 by F. H. Müller, a\r\nchemist and Government official, the materials being obtained from the\r\nisland of Bornholm. In this case the German influence came from Meissen,\r\nand also, it would seem, by way of Fürstenberg, for we hear of a certain\r\nVon Lang from that town (probably the Von Langen mentioned above), baron\r\nand arcanist, who helped in the founding of the works. The factory was\r\ntaken over by the Government in 1779, and it was long worked at a loss.\r\nThe mark of three wavy lines in blue on this ware stands for the Sound,\r\nthe Great and the Little Belt (PL. C. 43). The curved mouldings,\r\nradiating in sets of three from a central medallion, sometimes found on\r\nbowls and plates, may also have a similar reference. This latter\r\ndecoration is shown well on a bowl at South Kensington, painted with\r\nbirds and flowers in gold frames. The handsome _cabarets_ and\r\ndinner-services produced in the eighteenth century belong to the German\r\nschool of the time, and have little relation to the more recent\r\ndevelopments about which we shall have a word to say in chapter xxiii.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSSIA.--Peter the Great, at the instigation of his friend and ally,\r\nAugustus of Saxony, is said to have projected a manufactory of porcelain\r\nat St. Petersburg, but the scheme was not carried out till the time of\r\nthe Empress Elizabeth. This was probably about 1756, or perhaps\r\nearlier, and she doubtless, a few years later, welcomed the Meissen\r\npotters driven out by her mortal enemy, Frederick.[168] Under Catherine\r\nII. these works rose to some importance, and among the many artists and\r\nsculptors attracted to her court, not a few--Falconet, among\r\nothers--were employed as modellers or painters on porcelain. But on the\r\nwhole the Russian porcelain was influenced more by Saxon models, and we\r\nhear that the gaps in the court services of Meissen ware were so well\r\nreplaced by native pieces that the new dishes and plates were not to be\r\ndistinguished from the old. The kaolin and the china-stone were derived\r\nfrom native sources.\r\n\r\nAfter the Napoleonic war the manufacture of gigantic vases, in the style\r\nof those made at Sèvres under Brongniart’s _régime_, was attempted, and\r\nseveral skilful artists migrated from France. Technically the porcelain\r\nwas not inferior to the hard paste of the latter country. The only mark\r\nis the initial of the reigning Emperor or Empress in Russian characters\r\n(PL. C. 46), surmounted sometimes by a crown, but beyond these letters\r\nthere is nothing Russian about the ware. The factory, which is still\r\ncarried on, has always been an appanage of the court, and its chief\r\nproduce has consisted in gala pieces for imperial presents.\r\n\r\nNot much seems to be known about a certain Gardner, an Englishman, who\r\nin 1787 organised a porcelain factory at Tver, near Moscow. Some\r\nstatuettes with his initials, written in Russian, have been attributed\r\nto him. His name occurs in full, again in Russian letters, on some\r\nsmall pieces of ribbed porcelain, decorated with green and gold. The\r\nfactory seems to have long preserved his name, for on a statuette of a\r\nRussian peasant, in the Franks collection, the words _Fabrika Gardnery_\r\nare accompanied by the initials of Alexander II. (PL. C. 45).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nTHE SOFT-PASTE PORCELAIN OF FRANCE\r\n\r\nSAINT-CLOUD--LILLE--CHANTILLY--MENNECY--PARIS--VINCENNES--SÈVRES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have now to take up the history of the soft-paste porcelain of\r\nFrance, and in the first place to follow the stages that intervene\r\nbetween the early tentative ware made by Poterat at Rouen (see p. 239)\r\nand the fully developed ‘artificial’ porcelain of Sèvres. We have, then,\r\nto deal first with the wares of Saint-Cloud and Chantilly, and in part\r\nwith those of Lille and Mennecy-Villeroy.\r\n\r\nBut before saying anything of the different wares we had better go back\r\nto the technical side of our subject, and give some explanation of the\r\nterm soft paste,[169] artificial paste, or frit paste.\r\n\r\nWe have come across something of this sort before in the case of the\r\nMedici ware. This was essentially the combination of a glass with a fine\r\nwhite clay. When we come to the French soft paste we find the kaolinic\r\nelement replaced by something between a calcareous clay and an impure\r\nlimestone, the _marne_ of the French, which may be rendered by our\r\nsomewhat vague expression, marl.\r\n\r\nM. Vogt (_La Porcelaine_, Paris, 1893) quotes from a memoir drawn up in\r\n1753 by Hellot, a prominent member of the Academy of Science, which well\r\nillustrates the point of view of the time. Hellot knew all about kaolin\r\nand petuntse, as described by the Jesuit missionaries, but he despaired\r\nof finding the materials in France. M. de Réaumur, he tells us, made, it\r\nis true, a greyish refractory ware from what he (Réaumur) claimed to be\r\nthe French equivalent of these materials, but the ‘firm, compact,\r\nsnow-like porcelain of China, what we commonly know as _Ancien Japon_\r\n(_sic_) has yet to be imitated.’ After giving an outline of the history\r\nof French soft paste up to this time (to this important contemporary\r\nevidence we shall return shortly), Hellot claims that this soft paste is\r\nequal to the real ‘Japan,’ except that the grain is less fine, while as\r\nfor ‘the Saxon ware, it is no porcelain at all except on the exterior.\r\nWhen broken it is easy to see that it is merely a white enamel, only\r\nharder than the ordinary enamel of painters.’ This, be it noted, is\r\nwritten forty years after Böttger’s great discovery. We see by it how\r\nwell the secret was kept.[170]\r\n\r\n_There is no question, therefore, but of soft-paste porcelain._ It is\r\nthus that Hellot sums up his report, written at the critical period when\r\nit was proposed to remove the Vincennes works to Sèvres, and place them\r\nunder more immediate royal protection, and for this verdict we have\r\nevery reason to be thankful.\r\n\r\nIt is from this same memoir, _Recueil de tous les procédés de la\r\nPorcelaine de la Manufacture Royale de Vincennes_, that we obtain the\r\nmost accurate details of the composition of the soft paste made at this\r\ntime. It was a strictly private document, written expressly for the king\r\nby Hellot, who had recently been appointed to the direction of the\r\nVincennes factory. This report was unearthed some time ago from among\r\nthe archives at Sèvres.\r\n\r\nAccording to Hellot, writing in 1753, just as the Chinese combine the\r\nmore fusible petuntse with the kaolin--‘a kind of talc which neither\r\ncalcines nor vitrifies’--so with our frit, an artificial petuntse, we\r\nmust mix, not an unctuous fusible clay, but some fine white infusible\r\nsubstance. Such a material is found in certain _marnes_ obtained from\r\nthe gypsum quarries near Paris.\r\n\r\nThe frit employed at Vincennes at this time--and the composition seems\r\nto have varied little up to the last days of soft paste in France--was\r\nessentially an alkaline silicate, containing also some lime and alumina,\r\nas will be seen from the following recipe:--\r\n\r\n  Fused nitre,             22 per cent.\r\n  Sea salt,                 7    ”\r\n  Alicante soda,            3·7  ”\r\n  Rock alum,                3·7  ”\r\n  Montmartre gypsum,        3·7  ”\r\n  Fontainebleau sand,      60    ”\r\n\r\nThese ingredients, some of which are soluble in water, are fritted\r\ntogether--that is to say, imperfectly fused--in a part of the kiln\r\nspecially reserved for them, great precautions being taken to regulate\r\nthe heat. After reducing the frit to powder, the superfluous salts had\r\nto be thoroughly washed out by means of boiling water, before the\r\nsubstance was fit for mixing with the ‘body’ constituent of the paste.\r\n\r\nThis body is prepared from the _grosse marne_ found at Argenteuil, by\r\ncareful sifting and decantation. Six parts of the prepared frit are\r\nmixed with one part of the washed marl and with one part of a kind of\r\nchalk called _blanc d’Espagne_ (this last substance was afterwards\r\ndispensed with), and the whole thoroughly united by a grinding process\r\nwhich lasted for nine days. The resulting paste was made up into balls\r\nand allowed to ‘ferment’ for seven or eight months.\r\n\r\nNow, if we glance over the various materials that have entered into the\r\ncomposition of this very ‘artificial’ paste, we see that alumina, the\r\nsubstance which, together with silica, we regard as the essential\r\nelement in all fictile materials, is present in very small quantities;\r\nwhat there is of it can only be derived from the marl and from the alum\r\nin the frit; and this inference is confirmed by an analysis made by\r\nSalvétat--he found, indeed, only 2·23 per cent. of this earth in a\r\nfragment of old Sèvres. It may safely be said that in no other fictile\r\nware is so small a quantity of alumina present. With this poverty of\r\nalumina we may associate the want of plasticity--the extreme ‘shortness’\r\nwhich distinguishes this clay, if clay it can be called. In order to\r\nthrow it on the wheel it had to be worked up with a certain quantity of\r\n_chimie_, a mixture of black soap and fine glue; at a later time gum\r\ntragacanth was used. Most of the soft paste, indeed, was made in moulds,\r\nbut even in this case the _pâte chimisée_ had to be employed. It was not\r\ntill a later time that these difficulties were in part overcome by the\r\nintroduction of the English process of ‘casting.’\r\n\r\nThe kilns at this time were small, with only one hearth, in which poplar\r\nwood was burned, but the firing was sometimes continued for more than a\r\nhundred hours. Hellot tells us that after the first firing more than\r\ntwo-thirds of the charge had generally to be rejected. The\r\nremainder--the successful biscuitware--was now polished with grit-stone,\r\nbefore being dipped into the soup-like glaze slip: in the case of\r\nvessels of complicated outline, the glaze was painted on with a brush.\r\nThis ‘enamel,’ as the French sometimes call it--the term must not be\r\nconfused with our use of that word--was essentially a silicate of lead,\r\nsoda, and potash--a flint or crystal glass, in fact, containing nearly\r\n40 per cent. of litharge. Hellot describes its preparation as follows:\r\nthe constituents of the glaze, thoroughly mingled together, were melted\r\nto a glass, which had then to be reduced to a fine powder, and mixed\r\nwith water and vinegar to form the slip. The presence of vinegar\r\nhindered the deposition of the solid particles in the soup-like liquid,\r\nand at the same time promoted the adhesion of the slip to the surface of\r\nthe biscuit. This biscuit, with its thick coating of glaze, was now\r\nagain fired, this time at a more gentle temperature.\r\n\r\nThe plain white ware was now handed over to the painters and gilders,\r\nand it is at this stage that the advantage resulting from this thick\r\ncoating of an easily fusible, lustrous glaze asserts itself. The\r\npigments themselves, suspended in a flux of similar constitution, are at\r\nthe temperature of the muffle-stove completely incorporated with the\r\nsubjacent glaze, and do not, as in the case of the German and still more\r\nof the later Sèvres hard paste, lie as a dead coating on the surface.\r\n\r\nHellot gives in his report numerous recipes for these enamel\r\ncolours--there are as many as twenty-five for the blacks alone--but from\r\nthese empirical data little is to be learned. It would seem, however,\r\nthat the ‘enamels of Venice,’ prepared doubtless by the Murano\r\nglassblowers, were imported for this purpose.\r\n\r\nThe muffle-firing was a long and complicated process--the preliminary\r\nheating in the case of large pieces occupied twenty-five hours. The\r\nsuperintendence of the firing of each batch was delegated to one of the\r\npainters--a most arduous and responsible task which often occupied as\r\nmuch as fifteen days, for each piece had to pass to a fresh position\r\nwhen a requisite degree of heat had been obtained.\r\n\r\nThe above summary will give some approximate idea of the complicated and\r\ndelicate processes involved in the fabrication of the _porcelaine de\r\nFrance_ at the time when the ware that is now most prized by collectors\r\nwas being produced at the works. We must now give some account of the\r\nforerunners--the soft-paste porcelains made at Saint-Cloud and at\r\nChantilly in the early part of the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\n\r\nSAINT-CLOUD.--In 1695 the widow and children of Pierre Chicoineau (or\r\nChicanaux) petitioned the king for the sole privilege of making the\r\n‘_véritable porcelaine de la même qualité, plus belle et aussi parfaite\r\net propice aux mêmes usages que la porcelaine des Indes et de la\r\nChine_.’ In granting the petition, the rights of the Poterat family of\r\nRouen are reserved; but it is stated that no porcelain had been made at\r\nRouen for several years. The earliest description, curiously enough, of\r\nthe manufacture of porcelain in France, is to be found in _An Account of\r\na Journey to Paris in the year 1698_, by Dr. Martin Lister. In speaking\r\nof what he saw at the ‘potterie of Saint-Clou,’ Lister declares that the\r\npainting of the ware surpassed that of the Chinese, nor was the glaze\r\ninferior in whiteness and ‘smoothness of running without bubbles....\r\nAgain, the inward Substance and the Matter of the Pots was to me the\r\nvery same, firm and hard as Marble, and the self-same grain, on this\r\nside vitrification. Further, the transparency of the Pots the very\r\nsame.’ After more than twenty-five years of experiment it was only, says\r\nDr. Lister, within the last three that the process had been brought to\r\nperfection. We may therefore place the beginning of the porcelain of\r\nSaint-Cloud about the year 1695.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PLATE XXXIII._ 1--ROUEN, BLUE AND WHITE\r\n2--SAINT-CLOUD, CELADON\r\n3--SAINT-CLOUD, BLUE AND WHITE]\r\n\r\nIn the _Mercure Galant_ of October 1700 we hear of frequent visits of\r\nprinces, lords, and ambassadors to the works of ‘M. Chicanaux,’ above\r\nall of the young Duchesse de Bourgogne, who ‘stopped her carriage at the\r\ngate to see the manufacture of fine porcelain which has not its like in\r\nall Europe.’ This reads very like a modern _réclame_, but it is\r\nimportant as showing the interest already taken by great people in the\r\nnew ware.\r\n\r\nAt a later time the Saint-Cloud works came more directly under the\r\npatronage of the Dukes of Orleans, both the regent and his son ‘Louis le\r\nDévot.’ It was then in the hands of Henri Trou, who had married\r\nChicoineau’s widow. Earlier Chicoineau pieces (1702-1712) bear as a mark\r\nthe sun of Louis XIV. roughly traced in blue (PL. D. 51). At a later\r\ntime, under the Trou _régime_, we find a roughly drawn T surmounted by\r\nthe letters S.-C. (PL. D. 52). The specimens of this ware--there are\r\nplenty of them in the French museums and several at South\r\nKensington--are seldom of any size, and the decoration is generally\r\nsparingly applied to the milk-white ground. In the earlier pieces the\r\n_lambrequins_ borders in under-glaze blue carry on the tradition of the\r\nseventeenth century renaissance style in use at Rouen, and we find\r\nsimilar patterns moulded in low relief.[171] The moulded surface is\r\noften covered with a scale-like pattern (PL. XXXIII.): with this we may\r\nprobably identify ‘the quilted china of Saint-Cloud,’ of which there was\r\na tea-service at Strawberry Hill. But it is rather the Oriental\r\ninfluence that is generally predominant; and the white ware of Fukien,\r\ndecorated with sprigs of prunus blossom, is closely copied. Of special\r\ninterest are some very successful imitations of the _famille rose_. On a\r\n_trembleuse_ saucer at South Kensington[172] the _rouge d’or_ is used\r\nwith great effect; the way in which the pink is gradated with the white\r\nenamel shows full command of the materials. This saucer bears the T of\r\nthe Trou family as a mark, but we unfortunately do not know the exact\r\ndate when this mark was first introduced, and still less for how long it\r\nwas employed.[173]\r\n\r\n\r\nLILLE.--A manufactory of porcelain was founded at Lille as early as the\r\nyear 1711. The founders, in their petition to the mayor and council of\r\nthe town, acknowledge that their aim was to follow in the wake of the\r\nChicoineau family of Saint-Cloud, the only place in Europe, they say,\r\nwhere porcelain was made. At the same time they seize the occasion to\r\nattack the head of the Rouen works, who, they affirm, has attempted to\r\npalm off his inferior wares at Paris, to the prejudice of the real\r\nSaint-Cloud porcelain. Some side-light is thus thrown on the rivalry of\r\nthe Poterat and Chicoineau families. In fact, the porcelain made at\r\nLille closely resembles the Saint-Cloud ware. We find this especially in\r\nthe pieces with a white ground sparely decorated with _lambrequins_ of\r\nblue. It was, however, evidently made with less care, and we do not find\r\nthe milky paste which is so great a charm in the Saint-Cloud porcelain.\r\nThe mark, the letter L, stands for the town of Lille. This factory of\r\nsoft paste does not seem to have lasted more than twenty years. Late in\r\nthe century hard porcelain was made for a short time in this town, and\r\nit is claimed that it was at Lille that coal was first used for the\r\nfiring of porcelain. There is a plate in the Sèvres Museum inscribed\r\n‘_Faite à Lille en Flandre, cuite au charbon de terre_.’ The manager,\r\nLeperre Durot, was unsuccessful, however, in an attempt to introduce his\r\nnew fuel at Paris. In 1786 the Dauphin (he was only five years old at\r\nthe time) became patron of the factory at Lille, and the mark for the\r\nfew remaining years of its existence was a dolphin crowned.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHANTILLY.--We have seen how close to nearly every _Residenz-Stadt_ in\r\nGermany there sprang up a porcelain manufactory under the patronage of\r\nthe prince. In somewhat similar way the fashion spread in France. Here\r\nthe head of each branch of the royal house either took some already\r\nestablished factory under his protection, or promoted the setting up of\r\nnew works. At this time, I mean at the beginning of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, it was the mark of a loyal subject and good citizen to send the\r\nfamily plate to the melting-pot and to forward the resulting bullion to\r\nthe mint to be coined into money, in this following the example of the\r\nking. This was the case above all in 1709, when Louis was in great want\r\nof money. We are told that the Duc D’Antin, ‘the perfect courtier,’\r\nafter a sacrifice of this kind, ‘_courut à Paris choisir force\r\nporcelaine admirable qu’il eut à grand marché_.’ So that, in the words\r\nof Saint-Simon, the goldsmiths were being ruined, and the makers of\r\nfayence and porcelain enriched. This fashion gave, of course, a great\r\nstimulus to the establishment of new factories. Thus the head of the\r\ngreat house of Condé became the patron of the works established in 1725\r\nby Ciquaire Ciron at Chantilly. In the letters patent granted in 1735 we\r\nare told ‘_Notre bien aimé Ciquaire Ciron nous a fait représenter que\r\ndepuis plus de dix ans il s’est appliqué à la fabrique de la porcelaine\r\npareille à celle qui se faisait anciennement au Japon_.’ The prince,\r\nLouis Henri,[174] already possessed a remarkable collection of this\r\nOriental porcelain, and some sixty examples of this ware made\r\n_anciennement au Japon_, what we now know as Kakiyemon, are still to be\r\nseen in the Château of Chantilly.\r\n\r\nThe earlier porcelain of Chantilly is remarkable in this, that following\r\nthe example of the enamelled fayence of the day, it is coated with an\r\nopaque stanniferous glaze. On this ground, which resembles closely that\r\nof the earliest Japanese ware, the peculiar decoration of the Kakiyemon\r\nporcelain is closely copied.[175] Indeed, the delicate yet spirited\r\nhandling of this decoration--I would point especially to two cylindrical\r\nvases mounted in silver in the Fitzhenry collection (PL. XXXIV.)--is\r\nsomething that we are quite unaccustomed to in European porcelain. It\r\nwill be noticed, however, that the over-glaze blue enamel is somewhat\r\nheavy in tone, and has evidently given trouble to the decorator.\r\n\r\nAt a later time the tin enamel gave place to a vitreous glaze similar to\r\nthat used at Mennecy, and the decoration most in favour was a somewhat\r\npoor underglaze blue. On such ware, especially on plates, we find the\r\nwell-known ‘Chantilly sprig,’ so often imitated on English porcelain.\r\nThis pattern is distinguished by a leaf, or rather bract, of peculiar\r\nshape at the branching of the twigs, and the design would seem to be of\r\nPersian origin. It is interesting to compare it with the very similar\r\nsprigs often seen in the decoration\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PLATE XXXIV._ CHANTILLY]\r\n\r\nof the Medici porcelain. The shield of the Condé family is sometimes\r\nfound on plates of this ware, the ‘baton of cadency’ between the lilies\r\nso reduced in size as to look like an accidental spot. The mark, a\r\nhunting-horn, is carefully painted in red on the older pieces; later on,\r\nit is found rapidly sketched in blue under the glaze[176] (PL. D. 53).\r\n\r\n\r\nMENNECY-VILLEROY.--This time it is not a prince of the blood, but a\r\n_très grand seigneur_, whose name we find associated with a group of\r\nFrench porcelain. It was on the estate of the Duc de Villeroy, the son\r\nof Louis XIV.’s notorious marshal, at Les Petites Maisons, near\r\nMennecy,[177] that Barbin began to make porcelain in the year 1735. The\r\nware he turned out is remarkable for a translucent body covered by a\r\nbrilliant and uniform glaze. Many kinds of decoration were tried by\r\nBarbin and his successors during the forty years of the existence of\r\nthese works. This period of time well covers the culminating period of\r\nsoft-paste porcelain in France, and the Mennecy ware fairly represents\r\nthe school as a whole in its more modest efforts. The decoration with\r\nscattered flowers (_bouquets de style français_) is perhaps the most\r\ncharacteristic design on this ware, but more ambitious work in imitation\r\nof Sèvres was attempted later. As at Saint-Cloud and at Chantilly, much\r\nattention was given to the little daintily painted ‘toys’--patch-boxes,\r\ncane-heads, and knife-handles--many of which were copied a little later\r\nat Chelsea.\r\n\r\nBut the reputation of Mennecy rests above all upon its\r\n_figurines_--little statuettes, generally brilliantly painted, though\r\nsome are covered with the plain white glaze only (PL. XXXV.). Others,\r\nagain, are in a biscuit of peculiar quality, and these last are at\r\ntimes remarkably well modelled. The mark D. V. (PL. D. 54), doubtless\r\nreferring to the patron, was maintained up to the time of the removal of\r\nthe works to Bourg-la-Reine, near Sceaux, in 1773.\r\n\r\nWe have taken up the porcelain of Mennecy at this point, as the date of\r\nits foundation is earlier than that of Vincennes. From its general\r\ncharacter, however, we might rather class it as a ‘younger sister’ of\r\nSèvres, while the other wares we have described, Saint-Cloud, Chantilly,\r\nand Lille, form a distinct and earlier group by themselves. These latter\r\nare distinguished from the later soft pastes of France, on the one hand,\r\nby the predominance of designs either of Oriental origin or derived from\r\nthe French enamelled fayence of the seventeenth century; on the other,\r\nby the restrained way in which the coloured decoration is applied, or\r\neven by the total absence of colour, so that, as a whole, these wares\r\nform an essentially white group of porcelain.\r\n\r\n\r\nSMALLER FACTORIES OF SOFT PASTE.--There were already, in Paris, during\r\nthe early or Saint-Cloud period, some small private works where\r\nsoft-paste porcelain was made. We hear of one in the Faubourg St. Honoré\r\nas early as 1722, belonging to the Veuve Chicoineau. De Réaumur, in\r\n1739, mentions a factory in the Faubourg St. Antoine. Some other\r\nporcelain works under the patronage of princes of the blood were erected\r\nat a later date. The Duc de Penthièvre took a keen interest in the\r\nporcelain made near to his _château_ at Sceaux, and this ware, first\r\nmade in 1751, is distinguished by its high finish and careful\r\ndecoration. So much cannot be said of the produce of the ducal kilns at\r\nOrleans, where both fayence and soft-paste porcelain were made about the\r\nmiddle of the century. Not long after, hard-paste porcelain was made at\r\nOrleans by\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PLATE XXXV._   1--SÈVRES, WHITE BISCUIT\r\n2--MENNECY, GLAZED WHITE PORCELAIN]\r\n\r\nGérault, but it is doubtful whether all the pieces marked with the\r\nOrleans label (of three points) (PL. D. 60) can be attributed to these\r\nworks rather than to the factory at Clignancourt. The works at Arras,\r\nprobably the last started with the object of making a soft-paste ware,\r\ncannot be traced further back than 1771. Here the Demoiselles Delesseux,\r\nwith the support of M. de Calonne, manufactured blue and white ware in\r\ncompetition with the neighbouring factory at Tournai.\r\n\r\n\r\nTOURNAI.--Soft-paste porcelain was first made at Tournai in 1750, and\r\nalthough the town is now in Belgium, the ware there manufactured in the\r\nlast century forms, with that made at Lille and Arras, a distinct group.\r\nThe mark of two swords in saltire and four small crosses (PL. D. 48) is\r\nderived from the arms of Peterinck of Lille, the founder of the works.\r\nAt first a tower (PL. D. 47), from the town arms, was also used. Many\r\nvarieties of decoration were employed here both for blue and white and\r\nenamelled ware. But before long the commercial spirit prevailed, and a\r\ncommon ware was turned out in large quantities.\r\n\r\n\r\nVINCENNES AND SÈVRES.--‘_La porcelaine de Sèvres est sans contredit la\r\nplus belle qui existe._’ This is the dictum of no less an authority than\r\nthe late Baron Davillier, and we may doubtless accept it if we limit\r\nourselves to the porcelain of Europe. There can be no doubt but that the\r\nwork turned out by the royal porcelain works during the first fifteen or\r\ntwenty years of their existence takes an important, if not an essential,\r\nplace in the decorative art of the eighteenth century, and that, too, at\r\nthe best period of that art. As to the intrinsic artistic merit, if such\r\na thing exists, or even to the general decorative value of this ware,\r\ncompared, for instance, with the fayence of the Saracenic East or with\r\nthe porcelain of China and Japan, these are questions which we are\r\nfortunately not called upon to answer here.\r\n\r\nThe _Porcelaines de France_, for that is the name given in the\r\neighteenth century to the ware produced under royal patronage, were\r\nfirst made in the factory established in the riding-school at Vincennes,\r\nand at the present day the works are within the confines of the park of\r\nSaint-Cloud. It will, however, be convenient to include the whole series\r\nunder the name of Sèvres.[178]\r\n\r\nOur knowledge of the technical side of the subject is derived, as we\r\nhave seen, from the report that Hellot presented to the king in 1753.\r\nFor the history of the foundation of the works and the selection of the\r\nartists, we are chiefly dependent upon a memoir, written in 1781 for the\r\ninformation of the Government, by Bachelier, an artist who had been\r\nattached to the works as painter on porcelain since the year 1748.[179]\r\nIn this memoir we can trace the troubled history of the years of\r\nill-success and financial difficulties that preceded the final\r\nestablishment of the royal works at Sèvres--_Tantæ molis erat!_ ...\r\n\r\nThere were two names that we must always associate with this long\r\nstruggle: during the earlier period, at Vincennes, Orry de Fulvi, the\r\nbrother of the _contrôleur général de finance_; and after his death,\r\nMadame de Pompadour. It is rather a shady story upon the whole, and at\r\nthe opening we are reminded of the adventures of the arcanist Ringler at\r\nthe various German courts. M. de Fulvi, who had long been interested in\r\nexperiments on the manufacture of porcelain, started at Vincennes with\r\nthe assistance of two worthless and drunken ‘experts’ (the equivalent\r\nof the German ‘arcanists’) who had been tempted away from\r\nChantilly.[180] After repeated failures and much loss of money, the\r\nrecipes were stolen from one of those men by an astute and sober\r\nassistant, one Gravant, to whom the whole charge of the mixing of the\r\nmaterials was now confided.[181] Other workmen, and further secrets\r\nrelating to the preparation of the enamels were obtained from Chantilly\r\nby means of a free expenditure of money, and a certain success was the\r\nresult. But meantime the funds of M. de Fulvi are exhausted, and resort\r\nmust be had to his brother, Philibert Orry, the finance minister. This\r\nwas in 1745, and we see in this step the first definite intervention of\r\nthe Government. A company was now formed, with important privileges for\r\nthirty years, and by the influence of the minister, Hellot, from whose\r\nreport we have already quoted, was appointed chemical adviser,\r\nDuplessis, the kings goldsmith (or rather silversmith--_argentier_) was\r\nplaced at the head of the mechanical department, and a few years later,\r\nin 1748, Bachelier, to whom we are chiefly indebted for the history of\r\nthe works, became inspector of painting and gilding. Bachelier was not\r\nof much note as an artist.[182] It was to his organising power and\r\nenergy, however, that the group of artists and sculptors who have given\r\nsuch fame to the porcelain of Sèvres was first brought together.\r\n\r\nOn his appointment, says Bachelier, his first care was to abandon ‘_la\r\ngrossière imitation du Japon_’, and to furnish the _ateliers_ with\r\npictures, models, and prints, ‘_dans tous les genres, pour remplacer les\r\nproductions chinoises qu’on y copiait encore_.’[183]\r\n\r\nBoth M. de Fulvi and his brother died in 1751, the company was broken\r\nup, and but for the energy and influence of a certain M. Hultz, of whom\r\nnothing further is known, the manufacture would have come to an end. We\r\nmust remember that on the death of the finance minister, his former\r\nenemy, Madame de Pompadour, practically took his place. Her power was at\r\nthat time at its height (she ‘reigned’ from 1745 to her death in 1764),\r\nso that we may perhaps regard the M. Hultz of Bacheliers memoir as one\r\nof the favourite’s ‘ghosts.’\r\n\r\nIt was certainly the influence of the Marquise de Pompadour that induced\r\nLouis XV., in 1753, to sign the _arrêt_ by which the title of\r\n_Manufacture Royale de Porcelaine_ was conferred on the establishment.\r\nAt the same time many important privileges were granted. The\r\nestablishment was now removed to Sèvres, where a plot of ground\r\ncontaining some glass-works, the property of the favourite, was bought\r\nfor 66,000 livres, and the new factory set up in an adjacent domain that\r\nhad formerly belonged to the musician Lully. The king subscribed for a\r\nquarter of the new capital. The troubles, however, were not yet ended:\r\nthe workshops were badly built and badly arranged. Finally, in 1759,\r\nLouis took over all the shares of the company, which was at that time in\r\nliquidation. A yearly grant of 96,000 livres secured the financial\r\nposition. In all these arrangements we see the hand of the Pompadour,\r\nand still more in the keen way in which the business side of the\r\nestablishment was pushed. At the New Year a sale took place at\r\nVersailles, in the palace. The king presided, and fixed the prices of\r\nthe porcelain. A large purchase of china on these occasions was a sure\r\nway to royal favour and promotion.[184]\r\n\r\nA good deal of uncertainty hangs over the nature of the early work\r\nproduced at Vincennes, and no definite mark has been assigned to the\r\nfactory, before the time when the permission to use the double L was\r\ngranted, in 1751 or 1753. When, however, the royal cipher occurs without\r\na year letter, there is some presumption in favour of a date previous to\r\nthe latter year (PL. D. 55).\r\n\r\nWe should infer from what Bachelier tells us that up to 1748 the designs\r\nwere chiefly derived from Oriental china. But in addition the following\r\nforms and styles were in use in the pre-royal period at Vincennes:--\r\n\r\n1. A rage for the production of artificial flowers, especially in plain\r\nwhite ware, existed at one time, and when the Vincennes artists were\r\nable to rival the Dresden flowers that had previously been imported,\r\nfrom this department alone was a steady source of income obtained. The\r\nflowers first produced were confined merely to small detached blossoms,\r\nbut in 1748 M. de Fulvi presented to the queen a trophy of white\r\nporcelain which surpassed anything yet manufactured. On a base or\r\npedestal of white ware, mounted in gilt bronze, rises a small tree\r\ncompletely covered with blossom of white porcelain, under which stand\r\nthree female figures of the same material. The whole trophy is about\r\nthree feet in height.[185] So again in 1750 we hear that the king had\r\nordered similar bouquets of flowers, ‘_peintes au naturel_,’ which were\r\nto cost 800,000 livres! This for the famous Château de Bellevue, and for\r\nMadame de Pompadour.[186]\r\n\r\n2. Much of the porcelain made at Vincennes at this time (1740-50) was\r\ndecorated with scattered groups of flowers on a white ground, a style\r\nthen known as _fleurs de Saxe_. These flowers were often in high relief,\r\nand in this case they formed a passage to the first group.\r\n\r\n3. There exist certain small pieces, chiefly cups and saucers (of the\r\n_trembleuse_ type, as usual at this time), with a ground of a deep blue.\r\nA great vigour and depth is given to the colour (known later as _bleu du\r\nroi_) by its somewhat irregular or mottled texture, a result, it is\r\nsaid, of the manner in which it was painted on to the biscuit (it is an\r\nunderglaze colour) with a brush. We may note that the use of a dark\r\nground for porcelain was exceptional at this time in France. This _bleu\r\nde Vincennes_ was imitated with some success by Sprimont at Chelsea.\r\n\r\nGravant (he who had the secret of the paste) had before 1753, so Hellot\r\ntells us in his report, succeeded in making a paste much whiter than\r\nthat of Chantilly, so as to allow of a ‘_couverte crystalline et\r\nparfaitement diaphane_’ in place of the opaque ‘_vernix de Fayance_’\r\n(_sic_) used by Ciron at that factory. It is indeed important to\r\nremember that before the works were removed from Vincennes, the soft\r\npaste that we know as Sèvres had already reached its highest development\r\nboth as regards the materials and the decoration. The most\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PLATE XXXVI._ SÈVRES]\r\n\r\nbeautiful and characteristic colours were already used with complete\r\nmastery, and (certainly by the year 1753) the paintings of the _cartels_\r\nhad attained a delicacy and finish never surpassed in later times,--this\r\nis at least true of certain classes of subjects, the _amorini_ and\r\nwreaths of flowers, for instance. In proof of this I need only point to\r\ncertain pieces of turquoise in the Wallace collection (Gallery XV., Case\r\nA.), above all to the _soupière_ (No. 7), modelled, no doubt, after a\r\nsilversmith’s design. If we compare such pieces to the porcelain of\r\nSaint-Cloud and Chantilly, or to the somewhat tentative work turned out\r\nat Vincennes itself but a few years earlier, it is difficult to account\r\nfor this rapid advance, especially at a time of change and financial\r\ndifficulties. This is certainly the most interesting period--(I mean the\r\nyears just at the middle of the century)--in the whole history of French\r\nporcelain, and we must remember that the change came about precisely at\r\nthe time (1751) when Madame de Pompadour’s influence became predominant.\r\n\r\nThe free access to the royal factory--the workshops seem to have been\r\nregarded at one time as a fashionable lounge--made the preservation of\r\nany secret processes very difficult. Bachelier says that ‘_on vient s’y\r\npromener comme dans les maisons royales_,’ and he complains bitterly of\r\nthe loss of time, the dirt, and the accidents caused by the throng of\r\npeople. A succession of edicts, one as early as the year 1747, was\r\nissued, restricting the access of visitors.\r\n\r\nWhen the difficulties connected with the paste and the decoration had\r\nbeen surmounted, a demand arose for protection against the competition\r\nof outside works. With this object a whole series of edicts, many of\r\nthem of a contradictory nature, was issued between the years 1750 and\r\n1780. Of these the special aim was to prevent or hamper the production\r\nof porcelain in other works, above all in those within a certain radius\r\nof Paris, or failing that, at least to restrict the use of colour, and\r\nespecially of gilding, by such works as had to be tolerated.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the removal to Sèvres the staff consisted of more than a\r\nhundred workmen. Duplessis, the silversmith of the king, was intrusted\r\nwith the modelling and with the general artistic direction, and Hellot,\r\nas we have seen, was what we should now call ‘scientific adviser.’[187]\r\n\r\nBachelier complains that the nature of the paste and glaze was\r\nunfavourable to the production of small figures, ‘_luisantes et\r\ncolorées_,’ like those of Saxony. He claims to have been the first--this\r\nwas as early as 1748--to recommend the use of white biscuit to reproduce\r\nin porcelain, among other things, ‘some of the pastoral ideas of M.\r\nBoucher,’ and this style, he tells us, ‘had a great success up to the\r\ntime when M. Falconet, to whom the department was intrusted in 1757,\r\nintroduced a more noble style, one more generalised and less subject to\r\nthe evolution of fashion.’ Falconet was carried off to Russia in 1766,\r\nto execute for Catherine II. the great statue of Peter the Great, and\r\nBachelier then took his place. It was under Falconet that the best work\r\nwas produced in this department, although at a later date such\r\nwell-known names as Robert le Lorrain, Pajou, Clodion, Pigalle, and\r\nHoudon are found upon the books of the Sèvres works. No biscuit\r\nstatuettes of _pâte tendre_ were made after the year 1777.\r\n\r\nThe models after which the vases and other objects were designed--and\r\neach year some fresh form was introduced--are still preserved at Sèvres.\r\nWe can trace in them, as in the mountings of the contemporary\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PLATE XXXVII._ SÈVRES PORCELAIN]\r\n\r\nfurniture, the passage from the _haute rocaille_ of the fifties to the\r\nsimpler forms in favour at the beginning of the reign of Louis XVI.\r\n\r\nThe fashion of encasing the porcelain of China in metal mounts--for this\r\nthe large monochrome pieces were preferred--had come in at an earlier\r\nperiod. The contorted forms of the gilt metal undoubtedly bring out by\r\ncontrast the simple outlines and smooth surfaces of the crackle and\r\nceladon vases. In the Jones collection at South Kensington there are\r\nsome superbly fine examples of this collocation of French and Chinese\r\nwork. During the sixties and later it became the fashion to combine the\r\normolu and other kinds of metal-work with the Sèvres porcelain in many\r\nnew ways, and the _pendules_ of the time show ingenious combinations of\r\nthe two materials in endless variety. It must be borne in mind that the\r\nsimpler forms that we associate with the reign of Louis XVI. were\r\nalready asserting themselves several years before the death of his\r\npredecessor.\r\n\r\nIf we examine the choicer pieces in any collection of Sèvres china, we\r\nfind that the date-marks range within a very small interval of time--a\r\nfew years on either side of 1760. This narrow limit for the best work is\r\nwell exemplified both in the Jones collection and at Hertford House. We\r\nshall return to this point when describing the turquoise and rose\r\ngrounds of this time.\r\n\r\nOnce established at Sèvres under direct royal patronage, the principal\r\nefforts of the staff were directed to the designing and the execution of\r\nelaborate dinner-services, destined to be presented in turn to the\r\nvarious crowned heads of Europe. As early as 1754 a service was made for\r\nMaria Theresa, _la Reine-Impératrice_. In 1758 a service with a green\r\nground and figures, flowers, and birds in cartels was commanded by Louis\r\nXV. for presentation to the King of Denmark; in 1760 a _service de\r\ntable_ of two hundred and eighty-one pieces is presented to the\r\nElector-Palatine Karl Theodor, the porcelain enthusiast of Frankenthal.\r\nIn 1764, and again in 1772 and 1779, the _Ministre d’État_ Bertin\r\nforwarded to the Chinese Emperor Kien-lung, through the medium of the\r\nJesuit missionaries, presents of Sèvres porcelain.[188] In 1768 and 1769\r\na further grand _service de table, fond lapis caillouté_[189] is\r\npresented to the Danish king; in 1775 it is the turn of a Spanish\r\nprincess, and in 1777 of the emperor. In 1778 the king sends to the\r\nSultan of Morocco a tea-service, and at the same time presents other\r\npieces of china to the Moorish ambassador. In the same year the Empress\r\nCatherine ordered at Sèvres the famous service of seven hundred and\r\nforty-four pieces, _bleu céleste_ (_i.e._ turquoise) ground, decorated\r\nwith _camées incrustés_. The flowers in this set were painted by\r\nTaillandier, and the gilding executed by Vincent and Le Guay. There is a\r\nplate from this service at South Kensington: on the centre the letter E,\r\nformed of minute flowers, and the Roman numeral II, stand for Ekaterina\r\nthe Second. To this set belong also the three large _brûle-parfums_\r\nvases at Hertford House, and there are other pieces in private\r\nhands.[190] The empress disputed the price (328,188 livres) demanded for\r\nthe service, and a long diplomatic correspondence on the point has been\r\npreserved. M. Davillier gives some details of eight other royal services\r\nmade between this time and the end of the century, among them one with\r\ngreen ground, for Prince Henry of Prussia (1784), of which\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PLATE XXXVIII._ SÈVRES]\r\n\r\nseveral of the pieces were jewelled (_ornées d’émaux_), and in 1788 a\r\n_grand service de table_ with vases, cups, pictures, and busts sent to\r\nTippoo Saib, Sultan of Mysore.\r\n\r\nIt is usual to distinguish the different services, _cabarets_ or\r\n_garnitures_, by the colour of the ground which is maintained throughout\r\nthe set. Thus we find the _fond lapis_ mentioned above and the _fond\r\nvert_, a peculiar shade of green very much admired at the time and often\r\nrepeated in the lacquered furniture and even in the panels of a whole\r\napartment.\r\n\r\nWe have already spoken of the TURQUOISE BLUE, but the colour is so\r\nimportant that we will quote more fully the somewhat enigmatical account\r\nof it given by Hellot. ‘The _bleu du roi_ ground, called before the\r\nChristmas fêtes of 1753 _bleu ancien_ (Oriental turquoise by daylight,\r\nemerald or malachite by artificial light), with which his majesty has\r\nbeen so satisfied, is composed as follows....’ We are then told that we\r\nshould purchase at the Sieur Moniac, in the Rue Quincampoise, opposite\r\nto, etc.;--but it is needless to follow these details--in fact I only\r\nquote a few words as a sample of Hellot’s innumerable recipes for\r\ncolours. This blue enamel, for it is an enamel, and not painted _sous\r\ncouverte_ like the old Vincennes blue, is composed of ‘_aigue-marine_’\r\n(some preparation of copper) three parts, Gravant’s glaze one part, and\r\nof minium one and a third parts. The ingredients are melted together, _à\r\ntrès grand feu_, and the resultant glass finely powdered. ‘This powder\r\nis dusted through a silk sieve, upon the _mordant_ that has been applied\r\nto the surface of the already glazed porcelain. The piece is then heated\r\nin the “painter’s stove” (the muffle). The first layer of colour comes\r\nout sometimes crackled, and always irregular (_mal unie_). To make the\r\nenamel uniform, the piece is again coated and again passed through the\r\npainter’s stove.’ Not only the strength and quality of the enamel, but\r\nits tint also, vary much, even in pieces dating from the best period;\r\nsome examples tend more to green than others. In the more brilliant and\r\nintense examples of the _bleu céleste_, to give the colour its old or\r\none of its old names, the ground on close examination appears to be more\r\nor less mottled, darker clots, as it were, floating about in a lighter\r\nmedium. Indeed some such ‘texture’ seems to be necessary to bring out\r\nthe full effect and brilliancy in the case of other glazes and\r\ntransparent enamels on porcelain, and to its absence the dull and\r\n‘uninteresting’ aspect of much of our modern porcelain may be\r\nattributed.\r\n\r\n\r\nROSE POMPADOUR.--We have seen that the various shades of pink derived\r\nfrom gold (see the note on p. 284) had for some time been used in the\r\ndecoration of porcelain, but that the recipes for them were regarded as\r\nprecious trade secrets. The _rose carnée_, or _Pompadour_[191] (often\r\nwrongly called _rose du Barry_), belongs to this class. The credit of\r\nits first successful employment as a uniform ground-colour is probably\r\ndue to the chemist Hellot.[192] This colour was in use at Sèvres for\r\nonly a short period of years, say between 1753 and 1763. The dated\r\nspecimens in the Wallace collection range between 1754 and 1759. One is\r\nalmost tempted to associate its sudden disappearance with some whim of\r\nMadame de Pompadour; perhaps having in her possession nearly all that\r\nhad been made, she wished to ‘corner the market.’ The manufacture seems\r\nto have ceased _before_ her death (1764), and afterwards the\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PLATE XXXIX._ SÈVRES]\r\n\r\nsecret was lost. The _rose carnée_ ground is often associated with one\r\nof apple-green, but the combination is not a very pleasing one.\r\n\r\nGreat attention has always been paid to the GILDING at Sèvres. When\r\napplied heavily to the handles and feet of vases, it replaces, in some\r\nmeasure, the ormolu mounts. So, when surrounding the little pictures\r\npainted on the _cartels_ of vases and bowls, or on the centre of plates,\r\nthis gilding represents in position and design the gold frame of the\r\nperiod. At the time of the reorganisation of the works in 1753 we find,\r\nalong with Bachelier and Duplessis, a certain Frère Hippolyte, a\r\nBenedictine monk, mentioned as the possessor of secret processes of\r\ngilding, and he was well paid for his periodical visits to the works.\r\nBachelier, writing in 1781, has a note protesting against the excessive\r\nemployment of gold. The prohibition of its use at other porcelain\r\nfactories at this time was based, he says, on ‘economic grounds,’ that\r\nthe metal might not be lost for commerce. ‘This enormous expenditure of\r\ngold,’ he protests, ‘is the more revolting, inasmuch as it is in bad\r\ntaste.’ Bachelier distinguishes the ‘_or bruni en effet_’ from the ‘_or\r\nbruni en totalité_.’ By the use of the first, in opposition both to the\r\nunburnished and to the plain polished gold, it was intended to imitate\r\nchiselled metal (the ormolu mounts), and this method of burnishing, we\r\nare told, should be confined to large vases which are not subjected to\r\nany wear and tear by cleaning or otherwise. The gold, in all cases, was\r\nsimply sprinkled on without the admixture of any flux, and the\r\nburnishing was carried out chiefly by women in a special department of\r\nthe works. This burnishing was effected _au clou_, that is, by means of\r\na stump of iron inserted at the end of a stick. Agate burnishers were\r\nnot introduced till a later period. Great pressure was required in the\r\nearlier method, resulting in deeply incised lines, and there is less\r\nuniformity of surface than where the agate is used.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe JEWELLED SÈVRES has never found much favour in France, and the only\r\nname the French have for this decoration--_porcelaine ornée d’émaux_--is\r\nnot very distinctive. A transparent, glassy, or sometimes an opaque\r\nenamel of very brilliant tint is applied in the form of little beads\r\nstanding out in relief and set in gold mountings. This application of\r\n‘_appliqués_ gems in chased gold setting,’ unless used with great\r\ndelicacy and moderation, produces a tawdry and overloaded effect, above\r\nall when applied upon coloured grounds. But when these little\r\n‘paste-jewels’ are set upon the soft white of the Sèvres _pâte tendre_\r\nthe result is sometimes very pleasing. On a cup and saucer belonging to\r\nMr. Currie, now at South Kensington, the ruby and turquoise jewels are\r\nconnected by branches of gold overlaid with a transparent green enamel\r\n(PL. XL.). On the other hand, on a large ewer and basin of turquoise,\r\nwith a decoration of gold, in the ‘Londonderry Cabinet’ at Hertford\r\nHouse, which has the date-letter for 1768, the original design is\r\ncapriciously overlaid by a series of jewelled chains which (if we are to\r\ntrust the date-mark on the ewer) must certainly have been added at a\r\nlater time. Indeed the manufacture of this jewelled ware seems to have\r\nbeen confined to the years 1780-86.\r\n\r\nWhen a school of painting was first established at Sèvres, it was to the\r\nfan-painters and to the miniature-painters in enamel that Bachelier\r\nturned for assistance, and we can detect the mannerisms peculiar to\r\nthese two schools in the decoration of some of the earlier pieces made\r\nat Sèvres.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARKS.--By the royal decree of 1753, from which\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PLATE XL._ JEWELLED SÈVRES]\r\n\r\nwe have already quoted, it was ordered that all pieces should be marked\r\nwith the well-known royal cipher, the double L, and that a letter-mark\r\nindicating the year should be added (PL. D. 56). The single letters of\r\nthe alphabet carry us from 1753 to 1776; after that double letters were\r\nused till 1793, when the king’s initial was replaced by the letters R.\r\nF., with the addition of the word Sèvres. A mark of this latter kind was\r\nin use till the end of the century, after which time no more soft paste\r\nwas made.\r\n\r\nEach artist marked his work with a monogram or a private sign, often\r\nsuggested by a play upon the syllables of his name, as in the case of\r\nthe canting arms of heraldry. For example, ‘2000’ (vingtcents) was\r\nadopted by Vincent, the famous gilder; a branch of a tree by Dubois;\r\nand, more strangely still, a triangle, the sign of the Trinity, by an\r\nartist named Dieu. These marks were placed underneath, or by the side\r\nof, the royal cipher. The marks of more than a hundred artists have been\r\nidentified from the records kept at Sèvres--painters of flowers,\r\ngarlands, landscapes, marines, genre-subjects, and finally gilders. A\r\ncomplete list of these men, with their marks, may be found in Garnier,\r\nChaffers, and other writers on the subject.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of true kaolinic porcelain was begun in 1769, but the\r\nsoft paste continued to be made for another thirty years, side by side\r\nwith the new ware. It was not till the year 1804 that it was finally\r\nabandoned by Brongniart, the new director. He found the soft-paste ware\r\nunsuitable for the big pieces now ordered by the Imperial Government.\r\nThe paste was difficult to work, the preparation was expensive, and the\r\ndust formed both from the paste and from the lead glaze was injurious to\r\nthe health of the workmen. One or two attempts have since been made at\r\nSèvres to revive the old ware, but they have fallen through in every\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nBrongniart, in 1804, to provide funds for the impoverished works and to\r\npay the arrears of wages to the workmen, threw on the market the large\r\nstock of plain white soft paste that had accumulated in the magazine.\r\nNow at that time there were in Paris many skilled porcelain painters,\r\nsome of them ex-employés at Sèvres, and others, men who made a living by\r\npainting on the plain ware sent from Limoges and other factories. These\r\n‘chambrelans’ (they painted at home, _en chambre_, and corresponded to\r\nour English ‘chamberers’) were now employed by the dealers who had\r\neagerly bought up the ware that Brongniart had parted with.[193] They\r\npainted and gilt this white ware in imitation of the Sèvres porcelain of\r\nthe best period so successfully that the services they turned out have\r\nfound their way into royal collections. This ware, in fact, forms a\r\ngroup by itself, quite apart from the later imitations of the _pâte\r\ntendre_, which, in every degree of merit and demerit, are now found in\r\nthe china-shops of Europe and America. M. Garnier points out three signs\r\nby which this pseudo-Sèvres may be recognised: 1. The green prepared\r\nfrom the newly introduced chromium is of a warm yellowish tint, and\r\ndisplays none of the submetallic tints so often to be seen in enamels\r\ncoloured by copper, as in the _famille verte_ of China. 2. The gold on\r\nthis bastard ware, burnished with an agate polisher, differs in quality\r\nof surface from the old gilding worked _au clou_. 3. The date-marks and\r\npainters’ monograms were copied at hazard from the old pieces--at that\r\ntime no list of these marks had been made public--so that, for example,\r\nthe monogram of a gilder may be found on a piece decorated in colours\r\nonly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nTHE HARD-PASTE PORCELAIN OF SÈVRES AND PARIS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe soft paste of Sèvres, even during the period of the fifties and\r\nsixties, when the most exquisite ware was being made, seems always to\r\nhave been regarded somewhat as a make-shift, to be employed until the\r\nmaterials for making a true porcelain should be discovered in France.\r\nFor it was the ignorance of the true nature of kaolin, and where to look\r\nfor it, that so fortunately delayed its introduction at Sèvres. As early\r\nas the Vincennes days, one of the Hannongs of Strassburg had offered to\r\nsell his secret, and this offer was repeated at a later time by himself\r\nand by his son. At Sèvres, before 1760, two German workmen were retained\r\nto teach the Saxon process, but the materials had still to be obtained\r\nfrom Germany.\r\n\r\nMeantime Macquer, who had succeeded to the post of scientific adviser on\r\nthe death of Hellot, had been experimenting on his own account, and\r\nabove all encouraging others to search for the precious white earth\r\nwithin French territory. At length, in 1760, some samples were sent from\r\nAlençon, from which a true porcelain was made, but of poor quality and\r\nof a grey colour. Outside the Sèvres works the younger Hannong had set\r\nup a factory at Vincennes, and the Comte de Brancas Lauraguais, whom we\r\nshall meet with again in England, had by 1764 begun his experiments and\r\nhis search after deposits of kaolin. There still exist a few\r\nportrait-medallions moulded in hard porcelain, which, on the ground of\r\nthe letters B. L. engraved on the back, have been attributed to that\r\nenergetic nobleman.\r\n\r\nThe introduction, however, of the hard-paste porcelain at Sèvres dates\r\nfrom the discovery, in 1768, at Saint-Yrieix, near Limoges, of those\r\nfamous deposits of kaolin which have ever since that time been the main\r\nresource of the French porcelain industry.[194] Before the end of the\r\nyear 1769 Macquer was able to show to the king the first samples of this\r\nnew ware. The hard paste made for some years after this date was not of\r\nthe ‘severe’ type adopted later on. Not only did it contain as much as 9\r\nper cent. of lime, but, the kaolin employed being less pure, contained\r\nprobably a good deal of mica--in fact, this first type of French hard\r\npaste approached in composition that of the Chinese. It is even more\r\nimportant to note that the glaze used at the same time was of an\r\nentirely different nature from the pure felspathic covering afterwards\r\nadopted. It was composed of Fontainebleau sand 40 per cent., potsherds\r\nof hard porcelain 48 per cent., and chalk 12 per cent. As a result, it\r\nwas possible to decorate the surface with brilliant translucent enamels\r\nof some thickness.\r\n\r\nIt was the introduction of the felspathic glaze in 1780 that gave the\r\nfinal blow to the effective decoration of Sèvres porcelain. This glaze\r\nis made by simply fusing a natural rock (pegmatite) consisting of a\r\nmixture of potash felspar with a small quantity of quartz. The ease with\r\nwhich this glaze can be prepared, its hardness and uniformity of\r\nsurface, led to its universal adoption not only at Sèvres but in the\r\nporcelain works of the Limoges district that have for the last hundred\r\nyears supplied France with ordinary domestic wares--for such use its\r\nhardness renders it eminently suitable. But, as we have said, this\r\ncombination of refractory paste and hard glaze is incompatible with any\r\nbrilliancy of decorative effect, the enamel colours are quite unable to\r\nincorporate themselves with subjacent glaze, they lie dull and dead on\r\nthe surface, and the faults of the German porcelain are exaggerated.\r\n\r\nSo with the paste, a much harder and more refractory type was introduced\r\nat the beginning of the next century, and (apart from the recent partial\r\nintroduction of a milder type for special purposes) this type has\r\nremained in use to the present day. The lime in Brongniart’s new paste\r\nwas reduced to 5 per cent., while the amount of kaolin (65 per cent.) is\r\nprobably greater than in any other porcelain. There has been a reaction\r\nlately at Sèvres against this refractory ware, but the old formulas are\r\nstill employed for the porcelain made for practical domestic use. When,\r\nhowever, brilliancy of effect and artistic decoration are aimed at, a\r\ncompletely new type both of paste and glaze has been in use since the\r\nyear 1880, and concomitantly with the imitation of the Chinese\r\nmonochrome wares, an attempt has been made to follow as closely as\r\npossible the pastes and glazes of the Chinese. M. Vogt, the present\r\ntechnical director at Sèvres, who has had so much to do with these\r\nchanges, gives the following formula for the composition of the new\r\nporcelain: kaolin 38 per cent., felspar 38 per cent., quartz 24 per\r\ncent. The lime, it will be seen, has been completely eliminated from the\r\npaste; on the other hand, the glaze contains as much as 33 per cent. of\r\nthe _Craie de Bougival_.\r\n\r\nIt would be a dreary task to enter with any detail into the history of\r\nthe Sèvres works during the hundred years following the first\r\nintroduction of the hard paste. This period is associated in most minds\r\nwith the colossal vases that are to be found in so many of the palaces\r\nand museums of Europe. To judge from these examples, it would seem that\r\nthe chief object both of the design and the decoration was to conceal as\r\nfar as possible the nature of the material used in their composition.\r\nYou have first to persuade yourself that you are looking at something\r\nmade of porcelain: once convinced of this, you marvel at the technical\r\ndifficulties that have been overcome in its manufacture, but what it\r\nnever even occurs to one to look for in these monstrous vases, is any\r\ntrace of that beauty of surface and brilliancy of decoration that we are\r\naccustomed to associate with the substance of which they are composed.\r\n\r\nThe ‘Medici Vase’ now in the Louvre is probably the earliest of this\r\nlong series. This vase dates from the year 1783, and it is nearly seven\r\nfeet in height. But it was in the pseudo-classical style of the empire,\r\nwhen encouraged by Napoleon’s love of the gigantic, and by his desire\r\n‘_à faire parler la porcelaine_,’[195] that this new application of\r\nporcelain found its full expression. It is then that we find vases,\r\ncandelabra, _surtouts de table_ and clocks, in styles distinguished as\r\nEgyptian, Etruscan, Imperial, and Olympian. After this we can follow the\r\ndecline of taste in the succeeding _régimes_ till, with the total\r\nextinction of all feeling for harmony of colour and unity of\r\ncomposition, we are landed--in the reign of the ‘bourgeois king’--in the\r\nstyle or absence of style which is the French equivalent of our ‘Early\r\nVictorian.’\r\n\r\nThere is one name above all others that is associated, at Sèvres, with\r\nthis long period, that of Alexandre Brongniart, who was director of the\r\nworks from the year 1804 until his death in 1847. The son of a\r\nwell-known architect, and himself a fellow-worker with Cuvier, he\r\nattained some distinction both as a geologist and as a chemist. It was\r\nindeed from the point of view of a man of science that he approached the\r\nsubject of ceramics,--as a geologist to examine the position and\r\nstratigraphical relation of any material suitable for fictile purposes,\r\nas a chemist to analyse these materials and to discover fresh metallic\r\ncombinations suitable for glazes and enamels.\r\n\r\nIt was at this time, and chiefly under the influence of Brongniart,[196]\r\nthat the palette of the enameller was enlarged by the introduction of so\r\nmany new colours, the employment of which gives a new _cachet_ to the\r\ndecoration of the nineteenth century. Perhaps the most important advance\r\nwas in the employment of oxide of zinc in the flux, by means of which\r\nthe colours of many metallic oxides are developed and sometimes altered.\r\nThe green derived from chromium is essentially a nineteenth century\r\ncolour, and as it resists the highest temperature this green can be\r\nused, like the cobalt blue, as an under-glaze colour. From the chromate\r\nof lead an orange-red is obtained--the _rouge cornalia_, a crude and\r\ndangerous colour, and one that does not withstand high temperatures. An\r\norange-yellow from uranium, and a deep and uniform black from iridium,\r\nwere also introduced at this time or not long afterwards. The ‘English\r\npink,’ the lilac tint so extensively used in the transfer-printing of\r\nearthenware, was successfully imitated by adding a small quantity of\r\noxide of chromium to a flux containing oxides of tin, lime, and alumina.\r\nThe celadon green of Sèvres is derived, not from the protoxide of iron,\r\nbut from the sesqui-oxide of chromium, with the addition of a minute\r\nquantity of copper.\r\n\r\nBrongniart’s great work, the _Traité des Arts Céramiques_, still remains\r\nour main authority on the technical and scientific side of the art of\r\nthe potter, and it was he who, by establishing the museum and\r\norganising the laboratories at Sèvres, made that town a centre for all\r\nwho are interested not only in the special branch of porcelain, but in\r\nthe whole field of ceramic art. The position established by him has been\r\nwell maintained by his successors, by Salvétat, by Ebelmen, by Deck, and\r\nat the present time by MM. Lauth and Vogt on the technical side--above\r\nall by Édouard Garnier, the present director of the Sèvres Museum.[197]\r\nThese men have succeeded, in spite of much opposition, in again bringing\r\nthe national manufactory of porcelain at least on to a level with the\r\nartistic movement of the day.\r\n\r\nIn tracing the history of the Sèvres porcelain during the last hundred\r\nyears and more we can find at least one interesting aspect--we can\r\nfollow the steps by which the ware has responded to the social and\r\npolitical changes that have followed one another in France during that\r\ntime. The affectation of simple and homely tastes, and the sentimental\r\ntone fashionable in society during the years preceding the Revolution,\r\nare reflected in both the forms and the painting of the ware then made.\r\nThe classical spirit that already in the time of Louis XVI. had found a\r\nplace alongside of these idyllic aspirations somewhat later, under the\r\nlead of David, ruled every form of art. The various phases of the\r\nRevolution are reflected in the decoration of the porcelain, which even\r\nbecame a means of political propaganda. At the Hôtel Carnavalet, the\r\nmuseum at Paris consecrated to the history of the city, the political\r\nchanges of this period may be traced in a series of plates and cups,\r\nsome of them of Sèvres porcelain, decorated with emblems and allegorical\r\nfigures relating first to the liberal monarchy of the early years of the\r\nRevolution, and then in the sterner days of the Convention (when indeed\r\nthe existence of the works was only saved by the presence of mind of\r\nthe minister Paré) to the patriotic efforts of the leaders, and to the\r\nsuccesses of the republican armies. Portraits of the heroes of the\r\nnational assemblies and of the clubs, surmounted by caps of liberty and\r\nframed in arrangements of pikes and drums, replaced the nymphs and\r\nflowers of an earlier period, and even the guillotine, it is said, has\r\nfound a place in the decoration. A few years later the military element\r\nwas even more predominant. Eagles and thunderbolts, surrounded by\r\ntrophies of war, battle-scenes and the entry into Paris of the\r\nvictorious legions, commemorate the conquests of Napoleon.\r\n\r\nAfter the Restoration the decoration of the gigantic vases, each new one\r\novertopping its predecessor, became more and more pictorial. To obtain a\r\nbetter field for this pictorial display the greatest pains were taken to\r\nproduce large plaques of porcelain, some as much as four feet in length,\r\non which a school of accomplished artists painted laborious\r\nreproductions of famous pictures, ancient and modern. Not a few of these\r\nenamel-painters, at this time, came from Geneva, and some of the ablest\r\nwere ladies. Many remarkable specimens of this misdirected skill may be\r\nseen in the Sèvres Museum, and also in a room of the picture-gallery at\r\nTurin.\r\n\r\nUnder the republican _régime_ that succeeded the revolution of 1848, it\r\nwas again proposed for a moment to sever the connection with the State,\r\nbut with the establishment of the second empire a fresh life was given\r\nto the manufactory, on the appointment of Dieterle, an artist of repute,\r\nto the directorship. Some new developments were now attempted,\r\nespecially in the introduction of coloured pastes. It was only after\r\nmany fruitless attempts that any results were obtained by this new\r\nsystem. It is indeed a process quite foreign to the nature of porcelain,\r\nand even when technically successful the result is far from\r\nsatisfactory. At a later time, however, the experience gained by the\r\nexperiments of Salvétat enabled a potter of great skill and some feeling\r\nfor art to employ the coloured pastes with greater simplicity and better\r\neffect. M. Solon, since so well known in England, was the most\r\nsuccessful worker in this material. The decoration in his hands took the\r\nform of a white slip, or _barbotine_, laid on a coloured ground. After\r\nfiring, the light and shade of the design is brought out by the varying\r\nthickness of the now translucent coating, which allows more or less of\r\nthe coloured ground to be seen through it. In spite of its delicacy and\r\nrefinement the effect of this work is somewhat effete, both in style and\r\ncolour. In inferior hands, working with poorer material, the result is\r\ndeplorable.\r\n\r\nAt the present time, after experiments with many materials--the\r\ncrystalline glazes made with bismuth were at one time in favour--it is\r\nto the production of artistic effects by means of single glazes that the\r\ngreatest attention is given at Sèvres, following more or less in the\r\nlines of the _flambé_ wares of China. Not long since, a proposal was\r\nagain made in the Chamber of Deputies that the support of the Government\r\nshould be withdrawn from the factory. It is said that a timely report in\r\nan English paper to the effect that, in such a case, the works would be\r\nrun by an Anglo-American syndicate, had not a little to do with the\r\ndefeat of this motion.\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSER PARISIAN FACTORIES OF HARD PASTE.--In spite of the numerous\r\nedicts and proclamations by which it was attempted to maintain the\r\nmonopoly of the royal works at Sèvres, there were in Paris, in the time\r\nof Louis XVI., a number of private factories, some of them under the\r\npatronage of members of the royal family.\r\n\r\nIt was in Paris that Brancas Lauraguais, as early as 1758, made his\r\nexperiments with kaolin, and here, in the Saint-Lazare district, one of\r\nthe Hannong family (Pierre Antoine, of the third generation, the same\r\nwho had lately failed at Vincennes) made porcelain after the German\r\nstyle, perhaps before 1770. These works were patronised at a later day\r\nby the king’s brother, the Comte d’Artois.\r\n\r\nAgain, in 1773, one Locré started in the Rue Fontaine au Roi the\r\n‘_manufacture de porcelaine Allemande de la Courtille_.’ His marks of\r\narrows (PL. D. 59), torches, or later, ears of wheat, crossed in\r\nimitation of the Saxon swords, are found on ware of some artistic merit.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps the most remarkable of the Parisian factories was that\r\nstarted at Clignancourt, in 1775, by Pierre Deruelle, under the powerful\r\nprotection of Monsieur (the king’s brother, afterwards Louis XVIII.).\r\nThe royal edicts (as indeed was often the case elsewhere) against the\r\nuse of gold were ignored in this case, and the Sèvres ware--the simpler\r\nforms then in fashion--was cleverly imitated. The earlier mark, a\r\nwindmill (PL. D. 61), pointed to the famous _moulin_ on the neighbouring\r\nMontmartre. At a later time the letter M, under a crown, referred to the\r\nroyal patron.\r\n\r\nThe queen herself took under her patronage the factory started in 1778\r\nby Lebœuf in the Rue Thiroux. This is the ‘_Porcelaine de la Reine_,’\r\nmarked with the letter A under a crown (PL. D. 62), often decorated with\r\nleaves and little sprigs of the _barbeau_, the cornflower, then so much\r\nin fashion. These flowers, indeed, may be found on many other wares,\r\nEnglish and French, about this time.\r\n\r\nThe Duc d’Angoulême was the patron of the works started in 1780, in the\r\nRue de Bondy. It is noteworthy that this factory survived, still under\r\nthe original founders, Guerhard and Dihl, to the days of Louis XVIII.\r\nDihl was, as it were, a forerunner of Brongniart, being the first potter\r\nin France to employ the newly discovered colours derived from rarer\r\nmetallic bases. The Rue de Bondy factory had also the credit of\r\nproducing elaborate copies of pictures on plaques of porcelain before\r\nsuch things were attempted at Sèvres.\r\n\r\nThe factory established in 1784 at the Pont aux Choux is chiefly\r\nremarkable for the patronage of the Duc d’Orléans, Philippe Égalité.\r\nStarting with the brother of Louis XIV., whose arms are found on\r\ngigantic vases of ‘old Japan,’ this was the fifth member of the Orleans\r\nfamily who had interested himself with porcelain, in one way or another.\r\n\r\nI have only mentioned a few of the more important Parisian factories.\r\nFranks, in his _Catalogue of Continental Porcelain_, gives a list of\r\nseventeen works. Examples of most of these may be found either in the\r\nFranks collection or in that of Mr. Fitzhenry.\r\n\r\nAfter the Restoration the work done in Paris became more and more\r\nconfined to the decoration of porcelain made elsewhere. A special\r\nindustry--for such it may well be called--was the imitation of older\r\nwares, both Oriental and European. For this somewhat ambiguous work the\r\nSamson family has acquired a European reputation.\r\n\r\nAt the present day many more or less amateur potter-artists are working\r\nin Paris. Specimens of their work may be studied in the yearly _salons_.\r\nIt is no uncommon thing to see--in the neighbourhood of the Panthéon,\r\nfor instance--a notice in a window pointing out to those interested,\r\nthat a kiln for porcelain or fayence will be fired at such and such a\r\ndate.\r\n\r\nDuring the last hundred years Limoges has become more and more the\r\ncentre of the porcelain industry of France. A very hard, refractory\r\nporcelain is here made from the excellent kaolin of Saint-Yrieix, and\r\nthis ware not only occupies in France the position of our Staffordshire\r\nearthenware and semi-porcelain, but competes with these wares in the\r\nmarkets of the world. One of the largest works was started some years\r\nago with American capital, and the United States, until lately, drew\r\ntheir principal supplies of porcelain from this district.[198] It is to\r\na chemist attached to one of these factories, to M. Dubreuil, that we\r\nare indebted for our best account of the technical and chemical\r\nprocesses employed at the present day in the manufacture and decoration\r\nof porcelain (see the work quoted on p. 15). At Limoges there is a\r\nceramic museum, the most important in France after that at Sèvres, the\r\ncontents of which have been described by M. E. Garnier in a catalogue\r\nwhich, as far as continental porcelain is concerned, has, so far, no\r\nrival.[199]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nTHE SOFT AND HYBRID PORCELAINS OF ITALY AND SPAIN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe porcelain made in Italy in the eighteenth century is not of much\r\nimportance either from a technical or an artistic point of view. With\r\nthe exception of the Capo di Monte ware and its imitations, examples are\r\nrarely found in English collections. On the whole the decoration is poor\r\nin effect, and closely follows in the wake of the German wares. This is\r\nthe case at least with most of the porcelain made in the north of Italy.\r\nFollowing, probably unconsciously, the example of the early Medici ware,\r\nthe refractory element in the eighteenth-century porcelain of Italy has\r\ngenerally been found in a natural kaolinic clay which here replaces the\r\nquartz-sand and the lime of the French soft paste, and it is this\r\npeculiarity in their composition which led Brongniart to form a special\r\nclass for what he called the hybrid pastes of Italy.\r\n\r\n\r\nVENICE.--There is, as we have seen, strong evidence that porcelain was\r\nmade in Venice in the sixteenth century, but such evidence is,\r\nunfortunately, only documentary. We are in almost as bad a position when\r\nwe come to the ware manufactured in the city, perhaps as early as 1720,\r\nby the Vezzi, a family of lately ennobled goldsmiths (see Sir W. R.\r\nDrake, _Notes on Venetian Ceramics_, London, 1868, privately printed).\r\nThis\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PLATE XLI._  1 AND 2--VENETIAN, BLUE AND WHITE\r\n3--MEISSEN 4--FRANKENTHAL, LILAC AND GOLD]\r\n\r\nware was made by Saxon workmen with clay obtained from Saxony. To this\r\nfactory, however, we can safely attribute the tall cup and saucer, with\r\nthe arms of Benedict XIII. (1724-30), and the mark ‘Ven^a’ (PL. D. 63),\r\nin the Franks collection (No. 446).\r\n\r\nAt this time Hunger, the Saxon painter and gilder, was in Venice. He was\r\nalready back at Meissen in 1725, and Dr. Brinckmann thinks that he may\r\nhave brought back from Venice the process of passing the gilding through\r\nthe muffle, which about that time replaced, at Meissen, the older plan\r\nof ‘lac-gilding.’ The Vezzi works were closed in 1740, and not till 1758\r\ndo we hear of fresh attempts to imitate the Meissen ware. This time it\r\nwas a Saxon family driven out from Meissen by the war, one Hewelcke and\r\nhis wife, who set up a short-lived factory in which they attempted to\r\nmake porcelain ‘_ad uso di Sassonia_.’\r\n\r\nIt was probably with the assistance of Hewelcke that Geminiano Cozzi in\r\n1764 established the porcelain works where (as we learn from the report\r\ndrawn up by the _Inquisitor alle Arti_ a few years later) he gave\r\nemployment to forty-five workmen. Cozzi made porcelain ‘_ad uso di\r\nGiappone_,’ much of which was exported to Trieste and the Levant.[200]\r\nThis ware, decorated in Oriental style, must have been made exclusively\r\nfor the trade with the East, for, to judge from the specimens in our\r\nmuseums, it was rather the ware of Meissen than that of Imari that Cozzi\r\ntook as his model. We find on his porcelain small views, especially\r\ncoast-scenes and ports, outlined in black and gold; again, on tea-and\r\ncoffee-services, flower-pieces and _chinoiseries_. He turned out also\r\nsome biscuit and glazed statuettes of considerable merit. Cozzi’s\r\nfactory survived until 1812. An anchor in red, larger than that used at\r\nChelsea, and of a different shape, is the mark usually found on this\r\nchina[201] (PL. D. 64).\r\n\r\n\r\nLE NOVE.--A Venetian family, the Antonibon, had early in the eighteenth\r\ncentury established an important manufactory of majolica at Le Nove,\r\nnear Bassano. Later on they turned their attention to porcelain and,\r\nafter the year 1760, Pasquale Antonibon produced some successful ware\r\nmarked with a star (PL. D. 65). One or two well modelled and carefully\r\nfinished specimens of this porcelain at South Kensington show the\r\ninfluence of both Meissen and Sèvres. These works were in operation as\r\nlate as 1825.\r\n\r\n\r\nVINOVO.--In the royal castle of Vinovo or Vineuf, near Turin, some\r\nunsuccessful endeavours to manufacture porcelain were made with the help\r\nof one of the younger Hannongs of Strassburg. A Turin doctor, Vittore\r\nAmadeo Gioanetti, who had already made numerous experiments with the\r\nclays and rocks of the district, met with better success about 1780. The\r\npaste of this ware contains a considerable amount of silicate of\r\nmagnesia, obtained from a deposit of magnesite discovered in the\r\nneighbourhood by the doctor.[202] This hybrid ware is more easily\r\nfusible than a true porcelain, but it resists well rapid variations of\r\ntemperature. The usual mark is the letter V surmounted by the cross of\r\nthe house of Savoy (PL. D. 66).\r\n\r\n\r\nCAPO DI MONTE.--Here in the northern suburbs of Naples, just beneath the\r\nRoyal Palace, an important factory of soft-paste porcelain was\r\nestablished in 1742. Don Carlos, of Bourbon-Farnese extraction, had\r\nrecently exchanged his dukedom of Parma for the throne of the Two\r\nSicilies. In 1738 he had married a Saxon princess, but there is little\r\nsign of any German influence either in the design or composition of the\r\nware made at his new porcelain factory at Capo di Monte. Like his cousin\r\nat Versailles at a later date, he took the keenest interest in the sale\r\nof his porcelain. An annual fair was held in front of the palace, and a\r\nlarge purchase there was a sure passport to the favour of the king, who\r\nis even said to have worked as a potter himself. When in 1759 Don Carlos\r\nsucceeded to the throne of Spain as Charles III., he, as it were,\r\ncarried his porcelain works with him, taking away the best workmen, so\r\nthat little of interest was made at Naples after that date.\r\n\r\nTo this earlier period belong the plain white pieces often in imitation\r\nof sea-shells, or again resting on a heap of smaller shells moulded\r\nprobably from nature (a very similar ware was made at Bow and other\r\nEnglish factories). We find also highly coloured statuettes and groups\r\nof figures. But the name of Capo di Monte is associated above all with\r\nanother style of decoration. The surface of the ware in this case is\r\ncovered by groups of figures, mythological subjects by preference, and\r\nby vegetation, moulded in low relief and delicately coloured. This was\r\nthe ware imitated at Doccia in later days, and also, it would seem, at\r\nHerend, in Hungary. But perhaps the most characteristic pieces then made\r\nat Naples are the little detached figures, generally grotesques,\r\ndelicately modelled and painted (PL. XLII.).\r\n\r\nIn this Capo di Monte porcelain we may note generally the prevalence of\r\nextreme rococo forms. The glaze of the white ware has a pleasant warm\r\ntone resembling that of some of the Fukien porcelain, which may in part\r\nhave served as a model.\r\n\r\nWhen the factory was re-established first at Portici and then again at\r\nNaples, a very different influence is perceptible. There is a service at\r\nWindsor presented by the King of Naples to George III. in 1787,\r\ndecorated with ‘_peintures Hetrusques_,’ that is to say, with\r\nreproductions of antiques in the Museo Borbonico. This later ware\r\ngenerally bears as a mark an N surmounted by a crown.\r\n\r\n\r\nDOCCIA.--The interest of the factory at Doccia, some five miles to the\r\nwest of Florence, where majolica and many varieties of porcelain have\r\nbeen made for the last one hundred and seventy years, centres round the\r\nGinori family. The founder of those works, the Marchese Carlo\r\nGinori,[203] who belonged to an old Florentine family, was sent, in\r\n1737, by the Grand Duke on a diplomatic mission to the Emperor Francis\r\nI. He had already, at his villa near Sesto, succeeded in making some\r\nimitations of Oriental porcelain, and on his return from Vienna he\r\nbrought back with him the arcanist Carl Wandhelein. With his assistance\r\nGinori was able in a short time to turn out some well modelled\r\nstatuettes. The paste, however, was not very white or uniform, and the\r\nlarger pieces are generally disfigured by fissures. To this time belongs\r\nprobably a large statuette of a crouching Venus at South Kensington.\r\nThis kind of ware had its inspiration, no doubt, in the ambitious\r\nattempts to replace the works of the sculptor with which the Meissen\r\nfactory was occupied about this time. Ginori was soon after appointed\r\nGovernor of Leghorn,[204] and he is said to have despatched a vessel to\r\nChina expressly to bring back the kaolin of that country.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PLATE XLII._ 1, 2 AND 3--CAPO DI MENTE 4--DOCCIA]\r\n\r\nThe works at Doccia and the schools and museums attached to them are\r\nfrequently referred to by our eighteenth century travellers. There\r\nappears to have been a period of decline, as was not unnatural, during\r\nthe Napoleonic wars, but by the early part of the nineteenth century the\r\nfactory at Doccia had become one of the most important in Europe. On the\r\ndeath of the founder, in 1757, the works had been carried on by his son\r\nLorenzo, and he in his turn was succeeded by Carlo Leopoldo, who\r\nintroduced a new type of furnace. This remarkable dynasty of noble\r\npotters has carried on the Doccia works to the present day.\r\n\r\nBeside a large outturn of enamelled fayence and of hard porcelain, _ad\r\nuso di Francia_, a milder or hybrid type of paste has been largely made,\r\nand the materials have been obtained from many sources, native and\r\nforeign. The dealers’ shops in Italy have been inundated with imitations\r\nof the old majolica, and with the help of moulds obtained from the\r\nmoribund Capo di Monte works, close imitations of that ware have long\r\nbeen made at Doccia. Indeed the bulk of the porcelain decorated with\r\nmythological figures in low relief (more especially the larger pieces so\r\noften seen in dealers’ shops and in salerooms) has its origin in Tuscany\r\nrather than at Naples.\r\n\r\nThe mark, a star formed of two superimposed triangles, is derived from\r\nthe arms of the family, but this mark has often been omitted.\r\n\r\nIn the eighteenth century many kinds of ware were imitated; the plain\r\nwhite porcelain is, however, the most interesting, such as the already\r\nmentioned statuettes and the imitations of the Fukien ware, specimens of\r\nwhich were sent by Sir Horace Mann to Walpole in 1760. This kind of ware\r\nis whiter and of a more dead aspect than that made at Naples and at Buen\r\nRetiro. In the Franks collection are specimens from an interesting\r\nseries of small medallions with portraits of the grand ducal and other\r\nfamilies, in white relief on a grey-blue ground. These were made at\r\nDoccia, probably towards the end of the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPAIN\r\n\r\nBUEN RETIRO.--During the sixteenth century we have frequent references\r\nto the importation of Oriental porcelain into the Peninsula--the white\r\nware of Fukien is said to have been above all prized. In the seventeenth\r\ncentury we find Portuguese travelling merchants selling porcelain at the\r\nfair of St. Germain, and we hear that their stalls were visited by\r\npeople of quality from Paris. (_Cf._ p. 230.)\r\n\r\nBut this ware of the Far East has left little or no mark upon the\r\nfayence or porcelain made in Spain. In the former, at least, the\r\ninfluence of the nearer Saracenic East has always remained\r\npredominant.[205] The porcelain fever that raged at times in the rest of\r\nEurope seems to have left Spain untouched until the advent of the\r\nhalf-French, half-Italian king in 1759. Charles III., who abandoned his\r\nNeapolitan throne in that year to succeed his brother as King of Spain,\r\nwas on the whole the best of the many descendants of Louis XIV. who\r\nruled in France, Spain, and Italy in the eighteenth century. We have\r\nseen that he was an enthusiastic potter, and his first care, even before\r\nleaving Naples, was to see to the transhipping to Spain of practically\r\nthe whole of the staff, to say nothing of the moulds and other\r\nappliances in use at the Capo di Monte factory. Don Juan Riaño, in his\r\n_Handbook of Spanish Arts_, gives the names of nineteen modellers and\r\nfourteen painters who sailed for Alicante in a vessel specially\r\nchartered for this purpose. Among these Italian emigrants two names are\r\nworthy of mention--Buonicelli--he and his son after him superintended\r\nthe new works till the end of the century--and Gricci (there were three\r\nmen of this name among the modellers), the designer of the famous\r\nporcelain chamber at Aranjuez.\r\n\r\nThe new factory, known as La China, was erected in the garden of the\r\nBuen Retiro, a palace in the suburbs of Madrid. Here for the next thirty\r\nyears, that is until the death of Charles III. in 1788, supported by a\r\nlarge yearly grant, and surrounded by the strictest secrecy, was made\r\nthe porcelain destined for the decoration of the royal palaces and for\r\npresentation to other courts. Only in the time of Joseph, Napoleon’s\r\nbrother, and of Ferdinand VII., was the ware from the royal works\r\nallowed to come into the market, and this was at a period of decline.\r\nThe Buen Retiro gardens were the scene of desperate fighting between the\r\nEnglish and the French in the year 1812, during which the porcelain\r\nworks were completely destroyed.\r\n\r\nWe hear, at the commencement, of quarrels between the Spanish and\r\nItalian workmen, and of breakdowns in the kilns. But Charles and his\r\ndirector, Buonicelli, must soon have surmounted the preliminary\r\ndifficulties, for already, during the years 1763 to 1765 (as we learn\r\nfrom an inscription on one of the slabs), Giuseppe Gricci was occupied\r\nin decorating the porcelain chamber, the famous _Gabineto_ of the palace\r\nat Aranjuez, which surpassed in magnificence the earlier room of the\r\nsame description at Portici. The large plaques which surround this\r\nchamber are decorated with groups of Japanese figures in high relief,\r\ncarefully modelled and painted. Between these plaques rise tall\r\nlooking-glasses brought from the king’s new glass-works at La Granja,\r\nand the porcelain frames of these mirrors are elaborately decorated with\r\nfruits and flowers. There is another of these porcelain cabinets in the\r\nRoyal Palace at Madrid; this time the plaques are ornamented with\r\nchildren in high relief. Here and in the other Spanish palaces, at\r\nAranjuez, at La Granja, and at the Escurial, may still be seen vases of\r\nporcelain from Buen Retiro, some of them six or seven feet in height.\r\nThese vases are often set in gilt bronze mountings and filled with\r\nbranches of porcelain flowers.\r\n\r\nAmong the specimens of Spanish porcelain that we see in English\r\ncollections, it is the plain white ware that interests us most. This is\r\nof a very beautiful warm tint, and the vases are surrounded by _amorini_\r\nin full relief among flowers, or again by sea-shells modelled from\r\nnature, as in the case of the Capo di Monte ware. But many other things\r\nwere made--imitations of Wedgwood, for example, white relief on a dull\r\nblue ground.\r\n\r\nIn its last days the factory fell under French influence, and an attempt\r\nwas made to imitate the hard paste of Sèvres with the aid of native\r\nclays. It would seem that some of the paste made at an earlier time was\r\nof a hybrid nature, containing magnesia, like that of Vinovo.\r\n\r\nThe factory was re-established by Ferdinand VII. after his restoration,\r\nat the Moncloa, near Madrid, but with little success. Close at hand, at\r\nLa Florida, near the well-known Paseo, an attempt has been lately made\r\nto revive the works. Zuluaga, the famous metal-worker, has interested\r\nhimself in these new works, but the ware made is of little interest.\r\n\r\nThe fleur-de-lis of the Bourbons, generally painted in blue under the\r\nglaze, is the only mark that need be mentioned; it is probable that this\r\nmark was already in use at Naples (PL. D. 67).\r\n\r\nAt Alcora, in the province of Valencia, the Conde d’Aranda had\r\nestablished an important factory of artistic fayence as early as the\r\nyear 1725. Aranda played no small part in the short-lived revival of\r\nprosperity in Spain that followed the accession of Charles III. In 1764\r\nwe find him sending to Dresden for an arcanist, and in 1774 he obtained\r\nthe services of a French expert, one Martin, from Sèvres. Each in his\r\nturn covenanted with the count to make true porcelain, and we are told\r\nthat he sent specimens of his ware to his friend Voltaire at Ferney. Don\r\nJuan Riaño gives a full account of this factory, but there do not seem\r\nto be any specimens of Aranda’s wares in English collections that are\r\nanything better than a fine fayence.\r\n\r\nIn the Museo Arqueologico at Madrid there is a large collection of\r\nporcelain and fayence from Buen Retiro, La Moncloa, Alcora, and\r\nTalavera.\r\n\r\n\r\nPORTUGAL.--Some hard-paste porcelain was made at Lisbon before the year\r\n1775, and at Vista Alegre, near Oporto, the factory started about 1790\r\nis still carried on. Certain medallions of biscuit porcelain, in the\r\nstyle of Wedgwood, have found their way into the Schreiber and Franks\r\ncollections. To judge from an inscription on a minute plaque suitable\r\nfor setting in a ring, in the latter collection, these medallions were\r\nmade at the Royal Arsenal at Lisbon in 1792.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nENGLISH PORCELAIN\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION--THE SOFT-PASTE PORCELAIN OF CHELSEA AND BOW\r\n\r\nIn spite of the considerable literature that has sprung up upon the\r\nsubject, we know little of the early history of English soft-paste\r\nporcelain.\r\n\r\nWe have already spoken of the experiments made by Dr. Dwight in the\r\nseventeenth century. Dr. Lister, writing in 1699 (see above, p. 282),\r\nshows a remarkable acquaintance with the technical qualities of various\r\nkinds of porcelain: he speaks of ‘the inward Substance and Matter of the\r\nPots’ made at Saint-Cloud as the very same as that of the Chinese, ‘hard\r\nand fine as Marble, and the self-same grain _on this side\r\nvitrification_. Further, the transparency of the Pots the very same.’ He\r\nhad expected that at best they ‘might have arrived at the Gomron ware,\r\nwhich is indeed little else but a total vitrification.’[206] The man who\r\nwrote this must have been thoroughly acquainted with the physical\r\nqualities of porcelain; he must already have made some study of the\r\nsubject. And yet not only at that time, but for the next forty-five\r\nyears, there is a total absence of any evidence, documentary or\r\npractical, that porcelain was made anywhere in England.[207]\r\n\r\nMeantime new porcelain works were springing up in various parts of\r\nGermany, and in France the factories of Saint-Cloud and Chantilly had\r\nlong been at work. It is indeed from a French document that we get our\r\nfirst hint as to the existence of porcelain works in England before the\r\nyear 1745. In an ‘_arrest du Conseil d’État du Roy_’ of that year, by\r\nwhich Charles Adam is authorised to establish a porcelain factory at\r\nVincennes, a note of alarm is sounded. ‘A new establishment that has\r\nlately been founded in England for the manufacture of porcelain, which\r\nappears by the nature of its composition more beautiful than that of\r\nSaxony,’ will probably, so the document states, lead to the new English\r\nware replacing that of French origin (Marryat, p. 371).\r\n\r\nFor one reason or another there appears to have been a great outburst of\r\ninterest in porcelain about the year 1745. The works at Bow were\r\nprobably started at that time. There are in existence dated pieces of\r\nthat year which were almost certainly made at Chelsea, and these were no\r\nfirst efforts. As early as this, some porcelain figures may possibly\r\nhave been made at Derby,[208] so that we may perhaps take the ten years\r\npreceding 1750 as the period during which the industry was obscurely\r\npassing through its experimental stage. After this time, those who had\r\nbeen first in the field reaped a good harvest, for during the next\r\ndecade the china mania was at its height, and afforded much material for\r\nthe satirical and comic writers of the day.\r\n\r\nTo sum up the history of English porcelain in the eighteenth century, we\r\nmay take it that about the year 1740 the first attempts were made to\r\nimitate the various kinds of Oriental and Continental porcelain that\r\nwere every year coming more and more into use; that by the year 1750\r\nseveral factories were at work; and finally, that by 1780 the best had\r\nalready been accomplished, and the decline had already begun.\r\n\r\nTaken as a whole, our English porcelain, whether of soft or hard paste,\r\nshows little originality. From the point of view of design and\r\ndecoration we may divide the ware made during the eighteenth century\r\ninto two schools:--\r\n\r\n(_a_) The Oriental school, the wares principally imitated being--1. The\r\nwhite porcelain of Fukien, with decoration in relief, often of prunus\r\nblossom. 2. ‘Blue and white,’ the blue under the glaze--this is often\r\ncombined with the previous class. 3. The earlier type of Imari, that\r\nknown at the time as ‘old Japan,’ or ‘partridge and wheatsheaf.’ 4. The\r\nsomewhat later type of Imari with brocaded pattern, what we _now_ call\r\n‘old Japan.’ The enamelled wares of the great revival under Kang-he and\r\nhis successors, though valued by collectors both here and in France,\r\nwere less often copied.\r\n\r\n(_b_) The European school, which derived its inspiration from--1. The\r\nearly wares of Saint-Cloud, and later from those of Vincennes and\r\nSèvres. Speaking generally, the influence of Sèvres became predominant\r\nafter 1755, and to some extent ousted the earlier Oriental _motifs_. 2.\r\nDresden, which gave the type for the statuettes and also for the\r\nelaborate painting of flowers and realistic landscapes on plates and\r\ndishes. This German influence, favouring a dullish scheme of colour and\r\na ‘tight’ execution, was more apparent at an earlier and again at a\r\nlater period; during the best time, say from 1755 to 1770, it was\r\neclipsed by that of Sèvres.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that England is the only country where porcelain\r\nhas been successfully made without royal or princely patronage. The\r\nvarious kilns were here without exception founded as commercial\r\nspeculations--they were essentially the outcome of middle-class\r\nenterprise. There was, it is true, at one time some question at Chelsea\r\nof royal patronage, as represented by the Duke of Cumberland, but this\r\ncame to nothing. Some interest was taken and some advice given on the\r\nartistic side by one or two great noblemen--by the third Duke of Argyll,\r\nfor instance, an admirer of the ‘Kakiyemon’ decoration--but the capital\r\nto start and maintain the works came from the pockets of the more\r\nenterprising and businesslike of the designers and decorators\r\nthemselves, men like Sprimont and Duesbury, assisted by local bankers,\r\nmerchants, and physicians.\r\n\r\nAs a result, we find that a great feature in the commercial management,\r\none that was quite peculiar to our island, was formed by the annual\r\nsales by auction, advertised beforehand in the local papers. It was by\r\ncareful search through these advertisements and through the old sale\r\ncatalogues that the late Mr. Nightingale was able to clear up some at\r\nleast of the difficulties and misconceptions that have surrounded the\r\nhistory of English porcelain. The too ready acceptance of anecdotes and\r\n‘pleasant stories,’ copied from one writer to another with occasional\r\nembellishments, has been the cause of much confusion. These have\r\noriginated in many cases from the senile gossip of decayed workmen. The\r\nsame may be said of the disproportionate attention given to marks, to\r\nwhich more care has been given than to a critical discrimination of the\r\ndifferences that distinguish the paste, the glaze, and the decoration of\r\ndifferent wares.\r\n\r\nHow little was known a few years ago about the composition of our\r\nEnglish porcelains is shown by the general acceptance of the statement\r\nthat Spode, about the year 1800, introduced the use of bone-ash. It is\r\nnow known that nearly fifty years before that time the use of a\r\nphosphatic paste was general in England, and, according to Professor\r\nChurch, in ninety per cent. of the specimens in our collections\r\nbone-ash is an essential constituent. Thus the one original discovery\r\nthat we can claim for our country was either forgotten or ignored.\r\n\r\nApart from the hard porcelain of Plymouth and Bristol, our English\r\npastes may be divided into three classes. That first used was probably\r\ncopied as closely as possible from the pastes of Saint-Cloud and\r\nChantilly. It was a mixture of sand from Alum Bay and pipeclay from\r\nDorsetshire, with an amount of glass, in the form of a frit, sufficient\r\nto ensure translucency. Before long the sand and clay were replaced in\r\ngreat measure by bone-ash, and we get the ‘natural soft paste’\r\nespecially characteristic of English eighteenth century porcelain.\r\nFinally, at the beginning of the next century Spode replaced the glassy\r\nfrit by a mixture of kaolin and china-stone, retaining the bone-ash. A\r\npaste of this type has been in use ever since. Thus, in the year 1840,\r\nthe ordinary commercial porcelain of Staffordshire, which in its origin\r\nwas a development of the artistic wares of the eighteenth century, was\r\nmade from Cornish kaolin 31 parts, Cornish china-stone 26 per cent.,\r\nflint 2·5 per cent., and ‘prepared bones’ 40·5 per cent.[209] The last\r\nmaterial is made from the roasted bones of oxen, now largely imported\r\nfor this purpose from South America. The glaze on the earlier wares was\r\nessentially a silicate of lead and potash, compounded from white lead,\r\nnitre, and salt. But at present a harder glaze is used for the\r\nStaffordshire porcelain: it contains, in addition to the above\r\nsubstances, a considerable quantity of china-stone and china-clay,\r\ntogether with a little borax.\r\n\r\nOur English porcelain of the eighteenth century may be divided roughly\r\ninto five periods:--\r\n\r\n1. The early or primitive period, very often characterised by Chinese,\r\nand especially Japanese, schemes of decoration. Oriental wares are\r\nclosely copied, sometimes perhaps with the object of deception. The\r\npaste, containing no bone-ash, is soft and very waxy in appearance. Much\r\nof the ground is left unpainted, and there is no gilding. There is a\r\ngreat uncertainty as to the place of manufacture of many of these early\r\npieces.\r\n\r\n2. The fine period--approximately 1755 to 1768--especially associated\r\nwith the name of Sprimont, at Chelsea. The influence of the contemporary\r\nproduction at Sèvres is very marked.\r\n\r\n3. The Duesbury period, 1768 to 1786. Simple classical forms are\r\npredominant at Chelsea and Derby. The rich decoration previously in use\r\nat Chelsea is continued at Worcester, but applied to pieces of simpler\r\noutline, the vases often copying Chinese forms.\r\n\r\n4. The early commercial period. The business firms at Derby and\r\nWorcester almost monopolise the market. Somewhat later the factories in\r\nthe Severn valley form a link with the next period.\r\n\r\n5. The Staffordshire commercial period, equally commercial and\r\nessentially eclectic. Everything is copied, and there is a constant\r\ntendency to hark back to older types.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that some such historical arrangement, combined with a\r\ndivision according to types of decoration, might be made the basis of an\r\naccount of English porcelain; but it will be a safer course to follow\r\nthe usual topographical division, treating the different factories more\r\nor less in the order of the date of their foundation.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHELSEA.--The year 1745 is the earliest date to which any piece of\r\nChelsea ware can with certainty be assigned. The factory ceased to exist\r\nas an independent seat of manufacture before 1770. In this short\r\ninterval there were apparently some years during which very little\r\nchina was made. It is thus essentially an early ware, and Horace Walpole\r\nin his catalogue already speaks of ‘old Chelsea.’\r\n\r\nWe know absolutely nothing about the origin of the works. The Duke of\r\nBuckingham, in the time of Charles II., is said to have been interested\r\nin some glass-works in this neighbourhood, and to have brought over\r\nworkmen from Venice. The duke’s glass-houses were, however, more\r\nprobably at Lambeth. At any rate, at that time, the ‘cones,’ as the\r\nglass-houses were called, appear to have been regarded as places\r\nsuitable equally for the making of glass or the firing of pottery--so at\r\nleast I glean from the terms of an advertisement in which some of these\r\n‘cones’ are offered for sale. The origin of the well-known anchor-mark\r\nof Chelsea has been sought in Venice, but, as far as porcelain is\r\nconcerned, it was probably in use at Chelsea at an earlier date than in\r\nthe latter town.\r\n\r\nOur knowledge of the existence of a factory at Chelsea before 1749 rests\r\non the survival of two little cream-jugs of white ware moulded in the\r\nso-called ‘goat and bee’ pattern. Like some other pieces to which an\r\nearly date may be assigned, these little jugs bear as a mark a rough\r\ntriangle scratched in the paste (PL. E. 68), but they stand alone in the\r\nfact that beneath the triangle has been added, _before baking_, in a\r\nscrawly hand, ‘Chelsea, 1745.’[210] Thanks to them we are able, upon\r\nmaterial evidence, to put back the origin of English porcelain for five\r\nyears at least.[211]\r\n\r\nIn the year 1747, we are told in the _London Tradesman_, that at a\r\nhouse at Greenwich, and at another at Chelsea, _the undertakers had been\r\nfor some time trying_ to imitate the porcelain of China and Dresden, and\r\nin the same year a number of Staffordshire potters migrated to London to\r\nfind work in the Chelsea factory (Shaw’s _Rise and Progress of the\r\nStaffordshire Potteries_). In a London paper of December 1749 there is\r\nan advertisement of the sale of a freehold messuage in ‘Great China Row,\r\nChelsea.’ This was no mere misprint--China for Cheyne--(the two words\r\nwere pronounced alike at that time), for we come across the same\r\nspelling in more than one instance at a later date.[212] There is a real\r\nconfusion of the two names, arising probably from the interest taken in\r\nthe porcelain factory lately established in the neighbourhood; and this\r\nvery confusion is good evidence of the extent to which the china\r\nquestion was occupying people’s minds at the time.\r\n\r\nTwo months later, in January 1750, we hear for the first time of Mr.\r\nCharles Gouyn, but he is already, at that date, the _late_ proprietor\r\nand chief manager of the ‘Chelsea House.’ Of this Gouyn, presumably the\r\nfounder of the works, we know nothing. He was probably of French or\r\nBelgian origin.[213] Of Gouyn’s successor, Nicholas Sprimont, we know\r\nsomething more. Like his contemporary Duplessis, at Sèvres, he was a\r\nsilversmith, working at one time in Soho. Sprimont entered his name at\r\nGoldsmith Hall in 1742, and his mark is found on a pair of silver dishes\r\nornamented with shells and corals now at Windsor.\r\n\r\nFor twenty years (1749-69) the factory at Chelsea was dependent upon\r\nSprimont’s efforts. He was financier, director, and designer. When he\r\nwas ill the kilns were not lighted. When finally, in 1764, he had to go\r\nin search of health to ‘the German Spau,’ the stock and plant were\r\noffered for sale. At an early period--soon after 1753, it would seem,\r\nbut possibly somewhat later--he appealed to the Government against the\r\nconnivance of the custom-house officials at the smuggling in of Dresden\r\nchina. In this ‘_Case of the Undertaker of the Chelsea Manufacture of\r\nPorcelain_,’ Sprimont points out that ‘as the law stands, painted\r\nEarthenware[214] other than that from India is not enterable at the\r\nCustom House, otherwise than for private use.’ ‘The regulation,’ says\r\nSprimont, ‘is, however, evaded, especially by a certain foreign minister\r\nwhose official residence has become a warehouse for this commerce. What\r\nchance had a private person in a match with a crowned head?’\r\n\r\nFrom this ‘Case’ we learn that no porcelain or other ware, apart from\r\nthe importations of the East India Company, was allowed to enter the\r\ncountry, but that an exception was made in the case of plain white ware\r\nsuitable for subsequent decoration in England.[215] Private individuals,\r\nhowever, might import a certain amount of European porcelain for their\r\nown use on payment of a small duty. ‘This concession,’ says Sprimont,\r\n‘was greatly abused.’ Who, however, is the ‘crowned head’ who is so\r\nanxious to push the sale of his own goods in the English market? The\r\nElector of Saxony, it is usually said; but if we could put the date of\r\nthe ‘undertaker’s case’ a few years later, between 1759 and 1761 (there\r\nare, I allow, some difficulties in so doing), this charge would fit in\r\nwell with the efforts of Frederick the Great to convert the stock of\r\nporcelain he found at Meissen into the much-needed cash.[216]\r\n\r\nThe factory at Chelsea was situated beyond the west extremity of the\r\noriginal Cheyne Row, just before you come to the old church. The works\r\nextended for some distance along the west side of Lawrence Street.\r\nNothing is left of them now, but during some excavations made near at\r\nhand, in 1843, many fragments of porcelain were found. These pieces\r\nbelong, it would seem, to an early period of the manufacture.\r\n\r\nWe have already pointed out that neither the Chelsea works, nor indeed\r\nany other English porcelain factory, at any time received direct\r\nfinancial support either from the royal family or from the Government.\r\nSir Everard Fawkner, however, secretary to the Duke of Cumberland, was a\r\ncollector of china, and took some interest in the works. It was through\r\nhis influence, perhaps, that the ‘butcher of Culloden’ appears at one\r\ntime to have been brought, in some way, into connection with the Chelsea\r\nfactory.[217] Again, soon after his accession, the young King George\r\nIII. sent to the Duke of Mecklenburg a complete service of Chelsea\r\nporcelain which cost £1200. This is, I think, our first known instance\r\nin England of royal patronage, even in this restricted sense.\r\n\r\nIn common with the other porcelain made at the time, the decoration, and\r\neven the shapes, of much of the early ware of Chelsea were derived from\r\nOriental models. Of these Eastern types, the ‘wheatsheaf and partridge’\r\n(more properly quail) was most in favour. The Chelsea imitations of the\r\nold Japanese ware are distinguished by the abundant use of a heavy\r\niron-red enamel. There are several specimens of this ware at South\r\nKensington, but I would call attention, above all, to a very curious\r\n_compotier_ in the Jermyn Street collection.[218] This dish has a brown\r\nrim, and round the margin a quaint decoration of foxes amid clusters of\r\nred grapes. This is a very old Chinese _motif_, only we should have\r\nsquirrels in place of foxes. But the Chelsea ‘Kakiyemon’ never equalled\r\nthat of Chantilly, or perhaps even the copies made at Bow. On the other\r\nhand, the Chelsea plates made in imitation of the brocaded ‘old Japan’\r\nare unsurpassed among European wares (PL. XLV). Equally early, perhaps,\r\nare the plates and dishes with decorations of flowers and birds on a\r\nlarge scale sprawling over the surface. In these last examples the\r\ncolours are poor and heavy, and the general execution very rough. Many\r\nof the plain white pieces also belong to this early period.[219]\r\n\r\nIn the year 1754 Sprimont introduced the system of periodic sales by\r\nauction;[220] and we can in some measure trace the progress of the\r\nmanufacture in the advertisements and in the rare catalogues that have\r\nbeen preserved. Thus in the advertisement of the first sale of 1754 we\r\nalready find mention of groups of figures. The next sale, a few months\r\nlater, was made up of ‘the entire Stock of PORCELAIN TOYS ...\r\nSnuff-boxes, Smelling-Bottles, Etwees, and Trinkets for Watches (mounted\r\nin Gold and unmounted) in various beautiful Shapes of an elegant Design\r\nand curiously painted in Enamel.’ There was also in this sale a large\r\nparcel of porcelain hafts for table and dessert knives and forks.\r\n\r\nThis is the first mention that we have of these fascinating little ‘toys\r\nand trinkets.’ They often bear inscriptions in a somewhat lame French,\r\nwhich we might have looked for rather on the rival wares of\r\n‘Stratford-atte-Bowe’ than at a factory where we have reason to believe\r\nmore than one Frenchman was employed. Of these toys a representative\r\ncollection was made by Lady Charlotte Schreiber, and there are many\r\ncharming specimens in the British Museum. We must remember that about\r\nthis time, and perhaps earlier (1740-50), Saint-Cloud and, above all,\r\nMennecy, were turning out a similar class of objects.\r\n\r\nThe Chelsea sale of 1756 is the earliest of which a catalogue has been\r\npreserved, and in it we find the first mention of the ‘mazareen’ blue, a\r\ncolour after this time largely used as a ground for the more elaborate\r\nvases, both at Chelsea and at other English factories. The rage for\r\nporcelain was then at its height, and we see traces of this in the\r\nadvertisements of the time; but in 1757 Sprimont fell ill, and little\r\nwas made at Chelsea. In 1759 the collection of Chelsea porcelain made by\r\nthe already-mentioned Sir Everard Fawkner, lately deceased, was sold by\r\nauction. The sale occupied several days, and in the advertisement we\r\ncome across the earliest reference to the use of green _en camaïeu_--‘a\r\ntea and coffee equipage, exquisitely painted in green landscapes.’\r\n\r\nIt was about this time, Professor Church thinks, that the artificial\r\nfrit-paste was replaced at Chelsea by one containing a large quantity of\r\nbone-ash (as much as fifty per cent. in some cases). The earlier\r\nmaterial of the French type must have been very difficult to work, and\r\nit softened so readily in the kiln that many specimens were spoiled in\r\nthe firing. It had, however, a certain mellow charm given by its\r\ntranslucency and by the close unison of paste and glaze, that was never\r\nequalled in the later material.\r\n\r\nIndeed the high-water mark of the Chelsea factory was reached in the\r\nyears that succeeded Sprimont’s first illness of 1757. It was then that\r\nthe use of gilding became more general.[221] The gold was laid on by\r\nmeans of an amalgam, the mercury being expelled by the heat of the\r\nmuffle. The result, after burnishing, was to give a brilliant surface of\r\npure gold unlike the solid chiselled lines and bands of dullish surface\r\nseen on Sèvres china. But from an artistic point of view this result is\r\nnot very satisfactory--indeed, nothing has helped more to give a certain\r\ngarish and vulgar air to much of the English porcelain made at this\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nIn the notice of the spring sale of 1760, Sprimont sings the praises of\r\n‘a few pieces of some new colours that have been found this year at a\r\nvery large expense, incredible labour and close application.’ Among\r\nthese new colours we must probably reckon the beautiful claret or deep\r\npurplish crimson, the one colour of our English porcelain that has never\r\nbeen surpassed or even equalled on the Continent. It differs from the\r\ncontemporary _rose Pompadour_ not only by the greater intensity of its\r\nhue, but by being a transparent colour. This claret is, of course,\r\nderived from the purple of Cassius, and the peculiar tint is said to be\r\ndue to the addition to the gold of a small amount of silver. Among the\r\nother colours introduced at this time was probably a blue made in\r\nimitation of the famous turquoise of Sèvres. This blue is very rare as a\r\nground colour at Chelsea, and the tint is generally greenish and opaque.\r\nIt is found at its best on a large vase in the British Museum with\r\nopen-work cover and handles. In a diluted form the turquoise blue is\r\noften found as a wash upon the drapery of statuettes. The _rose\r\nPompadour_ of Sèvres was also imitated at a later date, but not very\r\nsuccessfully.\r\n\r\nThis is the time of the more ambitious vases, with a monochrome ground\r\ngenerally of deep blue and reserved panels painted with pastoral or\r\nmythological subjects, or with fantastic ‘exotic’ birds and flowers. The\r\npainting, even in the finest examples, never attained the delicacy of\r\nthe Sèvres prototype, and it is often lamentably inefficient, but at the\r\nsame time this very rudeness of execution sometimes adds to the\r\ndecorative effect of the _ensemble_. These vases are above all\r\ndistinguished by the strangely contorted shapes that Sprimont so loved\r\nto give to the handles, covers, and feet. All these points are well\r\nillustrated in the vases (made in the years 1762 and 1763) that Dr.\r\nGarnier gave to the Foundling Hospital and to the British Museum. The\r\npainting on these specimens is particularly bad and heavy. The\r\nmythological subjects, in the style of Boucher, on the famous\r\n_garniture_ with claret ground, now belonging to Lord Burton, show a\r\ngreater delicacy--in execution at least. This exaggerated rococo\r\ntreatment--in the extreme forms even the bilateral symmetry is\r\nabandoned--was doubtless suggested by the forms of the ormolu mountings\r\n(for handles and feet especially) then much in vogue.[222]\r\n\r\nTo a somewhat earlier date belong the moulded reproductions of animals,\r\nvegetables, and fruit so well represented in the Schreiber collection.\r\nIn the case of some of the models of birds, the plumage is admirably\r\nreproduced, and in a sufficiently bold style. Notice especially some\r\ncovered dishes in the form of partridges and doves. There was a sale of\r\nthese ‘Chelsea Tureens in the shape of hen and chickens, swans, rabbits,\r\ncarp, etc.,’ in 1756.\r\n\r\nHow brilliant and decorative in general effect was some of the ware made\r\nby Sprimont in his later days may be well seen in the collection\r\npresented to South Kensington by Miss Emily Thomson. It consists chiefly\r\nof plates and cups with grounds of deep Mazarin blue, and more\r\nespecially of the rich claret or maroon of Chelsea (PL. XLIII.).\r\nTechnically, however, many of these pieces are very imperfect--the thick\r\nglaze accumulated in pools and fissured by cracks, the painting\r\nrude--and yet for all this a plate of this ware which has found its way\r\nby some accident into an adjacent case, full of the finest Sèvres of the\r\nbest period, shines out from its surroundings like a jewel.\r\n\r\nThe single figures and groups are mentioned in the earliest\r\nadvertisements--some of the plain white statuettes date back probably to\r\nthe first days of the works. Here the English potters, in applying the\r\nsoft paste covered with a thick, brilliant glaze to such a purpose, were\r\nbreaking fresh ground. The crispness and the finish of the Dresden\r\nstatuettes they could never attain to with these materials. The English\r\nfigures and groups, whether made at Chelsea or elsewhere, are generally\r\nwanting in sharpness and precision of outline, a consequence in great\r\nmeasure of the thick-flowing glaze. In the kiln they had to be supported\r\nby an elaborate system of struts to prevent the fusible material from\r\ncollapsing, and this alone must have hampered the modeller in the\r\nselection of the design. Many of these\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PLATE XLIII._ CHELSEA]\r\n\r\nEnglish statuettes are childishly and hastily modelled, and yet here and\r\nthere, perhaps almost by an accident, the modeller has succeeded in\r\ngiving a naïve charm and vivacity to the little figure that disarms all\r\ncriticism. I could point to perhaps a dozen examples in our museums to\r\nillustrate this. Many of these statuettes are disfigured by the tawdry\r\ngilding, and by the ugly rococo or ‘scroll’ bases which are always\r\npresent in the Chelsea examples. The colouring is distinguished by the\r\nskilful use of pale and gradated tints: the greenish turquoise, the\r\n_rouge d’or_--both the English and the French tints--and the pea green,\r\nare--thanks, perhaps, to the crystalline glaze into which these colours\r\nmelt--boldly combined without any unpleasant effect[223] (PL. XLIV.).\r\n\r\nSprimont, who after all is perhaps the most interesting figure in the\r\nhistory of English porcelain, was after the year 1761 constantly\r\ninterrupted by ill-health, and the outturn of the kilns was for several\r\nyears very irregular; finally in 1769 the remaining stock was sold by\r\nauction. The next year, the contents of the factory, the moulds, the\r\nmodels--in wax, brass, or lead--the mills and the presses were purchased\r\nprivately by Duesbury _en bloc_, greatly to the disappointment of\r\nWedgwood, who had his eye upon certain of the models. Duesbury also took\r\nover the lease of the Chelsea works, and carried them on conjointly with\r\nhis main factory at Derby until the year 1784. In that year, on the\r\nexpiration of the already prolonged lease, the factory at Chelsea was\r\nfinally abandoned and the kilns pulled down.\r\n\r\nThe sales which had previously taken place at Burnsall’s in Charles\r\nStreet, Berkeley Square, were now held at Mr. Christie’s ‘in his great\r\nroom, late the Royal Academy, in Pall Mall.’ It was there that ‘Messrs.\r\nDuesbury and Co.’ disposed at intervals of the produce of the combined\r\nworks. But the history of Chelsea porcelain as a _genre_ apart comes to\r\nan end with the departure of Sprimont. During the remaining years of\r\ntheir existence, the Chelsea works formed merely a dependency of those\r\nat Derby.\r\n\r\nAs to the marks used at Chelsea, of the early incised triangle, which\r\nwas formerly ascribed to Bow, we have already spoken. The anchor in\r\nrelief on a raised oval cartouche (PL. E. 69) is found on relatively\r\nearly ware; it is associated with a waxy, translucent paste, and a\r\nsimple decoration without gilding. The mark, _par excellence_, of\r\nChelsea is the red anchor (PL. E. 70), but on richly decorated pieces,\r\nand especially those with much gilding, the anchor is often inscribed in\r\ngold.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOW.--From the beginning of the eighteenth century to the year 1744\r\nthere is no trace of the issue of any English patent relating to the\r\nmanufacture of porcelain. In the latter year, however, a specification\r\nwas registered according to which Edward Heylyn, of the parish of Bow,\r\nmerchant, and Thomas Frye, of the parish of West Ham, painter, professed\r\nto make porcelain, by mixing with ‘an earth the produce of the Cherokee\r\nnation in America, called by the natives Unaker,’ a glass composed of\r\nflint and potash. This unaker, no doubt a kind of kaolin (we are told\r\nthat the sand and mica had to be carefully washed away), was much talked\r\nof at this time (especially in Quaker circles), and its use preceded by\r\nsome years that of the Cornish china-clay.\r\n\r\nPossibly something resembling porcelain was made at Bow for a short time\r\nwith these incongruous materials; but in the winter of 1748-49 a second\r\npatent\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate XLIV.\r\n\r\n_Chelsea. Coloured enamels._]\r\n\r\nwas taken out, this time by Frye alone, ‘for a new method of making a\r\ncertain ware which is not inferior in beauty and fineness, and is rather\r\nsuperior in strength than the earthenware that is brought from the East\r\nIndies, and is commonly known by the name of China, Japan, or porcelain\r\nware.’ In the description of the materials employed under the vague\r\ndenomination of ‘a virgin earth’ produced by the calcination, grinding,\r\nand washing of certain animals, vegetables, and fossils, we probably\r\nhave, as Professor Church has pointed out, the first mention of bone-ash\r\nas a material for porcelain. According to the specification, the paste\r\nshould contain four-ninths by weight of the ‘virgin earth,’ and taking\r\nthis to mean bone-ash, this proportion corresponds most closely with the\r\namount of phosphate of lime found by Professor Church in some of the\r\nfragments from the site of the works which we shall describe directly.\r\nFrye’s glaze was to be compounded from a mixture of red lead, saltpetre\r\nand sand, with the addition of a small quantity of smalt, to correct the\r\nyellow colour of the paste.[224]\r\n\r\nThomas Frye was an artist of some standing who, towards the close of his\r\nlife, ‘scraped’ some mezzotints still valued by collectors. He died in\r\n1762, and in his epitaph it is claimed for him that he was ‘the inventor\r\nand first manufacturer of porcelain in England.’ The works of which Frye\r\nwas the manager before the failure of his health in 1759 were situated\r\nclose to the high road just beyond the bridge over the river Lea. Close\r\nby, in 1868, when making some excavations for a drain in the grounds of\r\na match-factory, a number of fragments of porcelain were found, among\r\nthem pieces of plain white with prunus ‘sprigs’ in relief, and others\r\npoorly decorated with under-glaze blue. Some of these fragments were\r\nevidently ‘wasters.’ With them were found some broken ‘seggars,’ and,\r\nwhat is still more interesting, a circular cake of frit, so that the\r\nsite of the kilns must have been near at hand.[225]\r\n\r\nThe model of the Bow factory, we are told, was taken from that at\r\nCanton, in China. It would be interesting to know to what building the\r\nreference is made, for it is doubtful whether porcelain was ever made at\r\nCanton. In any case, the name given to the factory, ‘The New Canton\r\nWorks,’ is interesting. Here in the east of London, one was then, as\r\nnow, perceptibly nearer to China and the East Indies than at Chelsea.\r\nThe river and the docks are at hand, and there is indeed only one\r\nstage--a long one, it is true--between us and Canton. So at Bow we find\r\nthe Oriental decoration more prevalent and surviving longer than\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe outturn of the kilns, like that of Chelsea, was sold periodically by\r\nauction, but the sales took place in the city for the most part, and the\r\nprincipal warehouse was in Cornhill. Though so difficult to identify\r\nnowadays, a large quantity of porcelain must have been produced by the\r\nBow factory during the thirty years of its independent existence. Like\r\nits rival at Chelsea, the works had many ups and downs, and Crowther,\r\nthe proprietor, became bankrupt in 1763. Compared with Chelsea, however,\r\nthe bulk of the ware produced was no doubt of a common and cheap kind.\r\nSprimont, in his ‘Case of the Undertaker,’ says somewhat contemptuously,\r\n‘The chief endeavours at Bow have been towards making a more ordinary\r\nware for common use.’ This is, of course, the dictum of a rival, but\r\nthe Bow firm, in their advertisements, only claim to provide ‘china\r\nsuitable for gentlemen’s kitchens, for private families and taverns.’\r\n\r\nThere has been the widest difference of opinion as to the actual\r\nspecimens of porcelain that may with certainty be classed as the produce\r\nof the kilns at Bow. The earliest dated pieces are of a very modest\r\nkind--certain little cylindrical ink-pots. There is one in the\r\ncollection formerly at Jermyn Street, with the inscription ‘Made at New\r\nCanton, 1751’; another in a private collection is dated a year earlier.\r\nThe execution is rough, and the hastily coloured decoration of flowers\r\nis in the Japanese style. Some little time after this, in 1753, we find\r\nproof that the kilns were turning out much more ware than the proprietor\r\ncould find painters to decorate.[226] They advertise in a Birmingham\r\nnewspaper for ‘painters in the blue and white potting way and enamelers\r\nin china-ware’; also for ‘painters brought up in the Snuff-box way,\r\nJapanning, Fan-painting, etc.’ They are at the same time in search of\r\npersons ‘who can model small figures in clay neatly.’ Such\r\nadvertisements seem to come from a commercial house with a large but\r\nperhaps irregular outturn. Sprimont would probably have exercised more\r\ncare in the selection of his artists.\r\n\r\nThere is a famous punch-bowl in the British Museum which is above all\r\nthe _pièce justificative_ of the Bow porcelain works. On the inside of\r\nthe cover of the box in which it is preserved is a long inscription,\r\nsigned at the foot by T. Craft, and with the date 1790.[227] Thomas\r\nCraft, formerly an enamel-painter at Bow, was probably at that time a\r\nvery old man. This bowl, he tells us, was made at Bow about 1760, and\r\npainted by him ‘in what we used to call the old Japan taste, a taste at\r\nthat time much esteemed by the then Duke of Argyle.’ This is\r\ninteresting. Craft refers probably to the so-called ‘partridge and\r\nwheatsheaf’ style, and the duke was doubtless a collector of this ware,\r\nlike his contemporaries at Chantilly and the Palais Royal. But the\r\ndecoration of this bowl has unfortunately nothing Japanese about it,\r\nexcept to some degree in the colour of the enamels employed. The heavy\r\nwreaths made up of minute flowers, upon which Mr. Craft tells us that he\r\nexpended two dwts. of gold and about a fortnight of his time, take their\r\ninspiration rather from Meissen. (Compare the wreaths, PL. XLV. 2.) The\r\nworks, he continues, which employed ninety painters and about two\r\nhundred turners, throwers, etc.,[228] had now, in 1790, ‘like\r\nShakespeare’s cloud-capt towers, etc.,’ shared the fate of ‘the famous\r\ncities of Troy, Carthage, etc.’ The site was occupied by a manufactory\r\nof turpentine and some small tenements. Mr. Craft, however, tells us\r\nthat he never used this punch-bowl _but in particular respect of his\r\ncompany_, and he hopes that those to whom it may pass may be equally\r\nabstemious. It is at present in the charge of the trustees of the\r\nBritish Museum.\r\n\r\nMany of the more elaborate figures and highly finished vases classed as\r\n‘Bow’ in the Schreiber collection at South Kensington are now regarded\r\nby most specialists as the production, some of the Derby works, and\r\nothers of the Chelsea and even the Worcester kilns. In view of the\r\nuncertainty and difference of opinion about the ware that is to be\r\nattributed to Bow, it is important to note the physical qualities of\r\nundoubted specimens. Professor Church lays stress upon the\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PLATE XLV._ 1--CHELSEA, COLOURED ENAMELS\r\n2--BOW, COLOURED ENAMELS]\r\n\r\ngeneral thickness of the ware, the remarkable translucency of the\r\nthinner parts, and upon the fact that the transmitted light is of a\r\nsomewhat yellowish tint, not greenish, as in the Worcester porcelain.\r\nThe glaze, though nearly white, is of a pale straw colour, and it tends\r\nto accumulate round the reliefs; it contains much lead, and is liable to\r\nbecome iridescent and discoloured (_English Porcelain_, p. 31). I would\r\nadd that a majority of the undoubted examples--I rely especially upon\r\nthose collected by the late Sir A. W. Franks, now in the British\r\nMuseum--are distinguished by a certain dirty and speckled appearance of\r\nthe surface of the glaze. I think that the Bow china has been less\r\ninfluenced than other of our wares by French and German examples. Apart\r\nfrom the Oriental decoration of some of the earlier pieces, it is on the\r\nwhole a very _English_ ware.\r\n\r\nThe process of transfer-printing, which had been first applied to china\r\nby Sadler of Liverpool about the year 1750, and which had been in use at\r\nperhaps as early a date on the enamels of Battersea, where Hancock was\r\nworking at this time, was employed a few years later at Bow.[229] A\r\npreliminary outline was sometimes printed under the glaze, and this\r\nsubsequently enlivened by enamel colours laid on by hand, as we see on\r\nsome barbarously painted dishes with Chinese subjects in the British\r\nMuseum. This transfer-printing is an essentially English process: it has\r\nsince been carried round the world in the wake of our Staffordshire\r\npottery, and the process has even been applied to porcelain in Japan. To\r\nthe general adoption of this mechanical process, more than to any other\r\ncause, we may attribute the dying out of the school of artist-craftsmen\r\nwho painted on china, and the extinction of all feeling for the\r\ndecorative value of the designs applied to the ware.\r\n\r\nI would call attention to some small figures in the collection formerly\r\nin the Geological Museum. These little statuettes are in a white glazed\r\nware of a slightly greenish tint, and they are attributed to Bow. The\r\n‘Draped Warrior’ and the ‘Seated Nuns’ appear to be taken from models of\r\na considerably earlier period, and their artistic merit is undeniable.\r\n\r\nJohn Bacon, the fashionable sculptor of George III.’s time, is said to\r\nhave found employment, when young, both as a modeller and painter of\r\nporcelain. He was certainly apprenticed in 1755 to a Mr. Crispe of Bow\r\nChurchyard, the proprietor of some pottery-works at Lambeth, and he may\r\nvery likely have worked for Crowther, at Bow, after the expiration of\r\nhis apprenticeship.\r\n\r\nA dagger or sword with one or more dots near the hilt, associated with\r\nan anchor, is the mark especially characteristic of the ware made at Bow\r\n(PL. E. 71), but much porcelain attributed to this factory carries no\r\nmark. A monogram formed of the letters T and F found on some early ware\r\nis perhaps to be referred to Thomas Frye, but the Worcester factory also\r\nused this mark (PL. E. 72).\r\n\r\n\r\nLONGTON HALL.--It has lately been recognised that porcelain was made in\r\nthe Staffordshire potteries, probably as early as the middle of the\r\ncentury.[230] This was at Longton Hall, in the borough of\r\nStoke-upon-Trent. From an advertisement in a Birmingham paper (July 27,\r\n1752) we learn that W. Littler and Co. were ready to supply ‘a great\r\nvariety of ornamental porcelain in the most fashionable and genteel\r\ntaste.’ It was Mr. Nightingale, I think, who first traced certain pieces\r\nof china, marked with two L’s crossed (PL. E. 81), to Littler’s factory.\r\nThis porcelain had previously been attributed to Bow. The Longton Hall\r\nware has no claim to any artistic merit. A crude blue is the prevailing\r\nground colour, and the contorted shapes copy rudely the rococo of\r\nSprimont’s Chelsea ware. The mouldings on the dishes and plates often\r\ntake the form of leaves. Some of this porcelain is exceptionally thin\r\ncompared with other English wares of this comparatively early period.\r\nThe flower-painting on the reserved panels of the plates should,\r\nhowever, be noticed. The carefully executed bunches of roses, somewhat\r\nrealistically treated, are perhaps the earliest specimens of a style\r\nvery prevalent at a later time in England, one which found its most\r\nfamous exponent in Billingsley’s work at Nantgarw and elsewhere. William\r\nDuesbury, a native of the district, was working at Longton Hall early in\r\nthe fifties as a painter in enamel. Nothing is known of this factory\r\nafter the year 1758.[231] There is some reason to believe that it fell\r\ninto the hands of Duesbury, but this is a disputed question. Professor\r\nChurch has analysed several specimens of the Longton Hall china. It\r\ncontains no bone-ash, and is in composition very close to the early\r\nChelsea ware.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nENGLISH PORCELAIN--(_continued_).\r\n\r\nTHE SOFT PASTE OF DERBY, WORCESTER, CAUGHLEY, COALPORT, SWANSEA,\r\nNANTGARW, LOWESTOFT, LIVERPOOL, PINXTON, ROCKINGHAM, CHURCH GRESLEY,\r\nSPODE, AND BELLEEK.\r\n\r\n\r\nDerby.--Porcelain of some kind was probably made at Derby not much later\r\nthan the date of the first establishment of Frye’s works at Bow. Mr.\r\nBemrose quotes entries from the work-book of Duesbury, which show that\r\nduring the years 1751-53 he was busy enamelling the products not only of\r\nthe ‘Chellsea and Bogh’ kilns, but that, although resident in London, he\r\nreceived work from Derby also. Indeed the price, eight shillings, that\r\nhe got for enamelling ‘one pair of Darby figars large,’ is higher than\r\nhis usual charge for painting the Chelsea statuettes (_Bow, Chelsea, and\r\nDerby Porcelain_).[232]\r\n\r\nWilliam Duesbury was a Staffordshire man. As early as the year 1742,\r\nwhen he was only seventeen, he was working in London as an enameller for\r\nweekly wages. This we know from his work-book, which has been preserved.\r\nIt would be interesting to know what it was that he enamelled at this\r\nearly date. From the same book we learn that in the years 1751-53 he was\r\nin London decorating china figures for the most part. These he\r\ndistinguishes as Bow, or Bogh, Chellsea, Darby, and Staffordshire. In\r\n1752 he paid a bill of £6, 19s. for colours, although at that time\r\nlittle gold was used by him. Among other entries in his work-book at\r\nthis period we find the following note: ‘How to color the group, a\r\ngentleman Busing a Lady--gentlm a gold trimd cote, a pink wastcot\r\ncrimson and trimd with gold and black breeches and socs, the lade a\r\nflourd sack with yellow robings, a black stomegar, her hare black, his\r\nwig powdrd.’ Each piece that he coloured is carefully noted, and the\r\nprice that he obtained given. For instance, ‘pair of le Dresden figars,’\r\n‘Chellsea Nurs,’ ‘a pair of Baccosses,’ ‘a hartychoake.’[233] We have\r\nalready referred to Duesbury’s connection with Littler’s works,--we may\r\nnote that his father was living at Longton Hall at this time.\r\n\r\nIn December 1756 there was a sale in London, by order of the ‘Derby\r\nPorcelain Manufactory,’ of figures, services, etc., ‘after the finest\r\nDresden models.’ For some time the ‘Derby China Company’ sold their\r\ngoods through their factor at ‘Oliver Cromwell’s Drawing-Room’ near the\r\nAdmiralty. It would seem that in 1756 Duesbury entered into some kind of\r\npartnership, at Derby, with Heath and Planché, the first a banker and\r\nproprietor of pottery-works at Cockpit Hill, and the latter a\r\n‘china-maker,’ of whom various more or less apocryphal stories are told.\r\nAll we can safely say is that Planché had probably been working for some\r\ntime at Derby as a modeller of figures.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1758 the Derby works were enlarged and the number of workmen\r\ndoubled, and this change has been coupled with the closing of Littler’s\r\nfactory at Longton Hall about the same time. But from this date to the\r\nyear 1769, all that we know of the Derby factory is derived from a few\r\nadvertisements in London papers. It is indeed a very remarkable fact\r\nthat, in spite of the most persevering researches--for how thoroughly\r\nthe ground has been gleaned we can judge by looking through the\r\nelaborate works of Haslem, Bemrose, and the late Mr. Nightingale--we can\r\nhardly point to a single specimen of porcelain made at Derby before the\r\nyear 1770, nor do we know of any mark that can be assigned to an earlier\r\nperiod than this. Can it be that up to this time the works were chiefly\r\noccupied in copying the wares, and perhaps the marks, not only of\r\nDresden, but also of Chelsea and Bow?\r\n\r\nWhen the Chelsea factory and its contents were sold in 1769, it was\r\nDuesbury, and not the Derby China Company, who was the purchaser. After\r\nthe year 1775, when the Bow works were also purchased, he had, with the\r\nexception of the Worcester manufactory, practically no rival in the\r\nfield.\r\n\r\nWe may take the year 1770 as the turning-point in the history of English\r\nporcelain. In France, by this time, the rococo of Louis XV.’s reign was\r\nalready giving way to the simpler, and in part more classical, forms\r\nthat distinguish the next reign, for it is common knowledge that the\r\nstyle known as Louis XVI. came into vogue several years before the\r\naccession of that king. In England the change can be best traced in the\r\nwork of the silversmith, seeing that in such work there can be no\r\nuncertainty as to the date. Already, before the end of the sixties, we\r\nfind in the silver plate then made outlines formed of simple curves and\r\neven straight lines replacing the troubled rococo scrolls, and by the\r\nyear 1770 the new classical forms have carried the whole field. And in\r\nlike manner the china made by Duesbury, both at Chelsea and Derby,\r\nfollows the new fashion.\r\n\r\nBut the vases bearing the Chelsea-Derby mark of an anchor crossing the\r\ndown-stroke of the letter D (PL. E. 73) differ from those made by\r\nSprimont not only in outline. A new scheme of decoration has come in,\r\none that continued with no radical change for the next fifty years and\r\nmore. Let us take the Chelsea-Derby vase in the Jones collection--it\r\nstands in company with several others of the Sprimont rococo type.\r\nNotice the oblique fluted mouldings of the upper part (a _motif_ taken\r\ndirectly from the silversmith), which are accentuated by deep blue and\r\ngold lines on a white ground (this is a scheme of decoration above all\r\ncharacteristic of Derby china). The reserved panels on the body of the\r\nvase are painted with pastoral subjects. Here there is little change,\r\nbut around these panels the ground is completely covered with flowers of\r\nvarious kinds--each species can be made out, but full-blown double roses\r\npredominate. These full-blown roses are a note that distinguishes\r\nEnglish porcelain from this time onwards. As they become larger, and\r\noccupy a more prominent place, the painting loses all trace of\r\ndecorative feeling. Billingsley carried them in his wanderings to all\r\nthe porcelain factories of England, and we are finally landed in the\r\nmonstrosities of Rockingham and the insipidities of Nantgarw.\r\n\r\nOne point we have omitted to mention in our description of the\r\nChelsea-Derby vase at South Kensington. The handles, winged figures\r\nsomewhat classically treated, are of unglazed ware. This is an example\r\nof the famous Derby biscuit, or bisque, as it is sometimes called, which\r\nwe now know was made as early as 1771. The greatest care was taken in\r\nthe preparation of this biscuit ware; any piece with the slightest\r\ndefect was rejected. The material allows of a sharpness and high finish\r\nwhich would be lost in the thick covering of the glazed ware. The paste\r\nin many of the examples has acquired a somewhat shiny surface, as if\r\ncovered with a skin of glaze. The best known specimens date from the\r\nlast years of the century, when Spengler, a modeller from Zurich, was\r\nengaged by the second Duesbury. In them we see exemplified that mixture\r\nof the sentimental and the pseudo-classical so much admired at this\r\ntime. The shepherd with his dog (there is an example at South\r\nKensington) is taken from a Roman relief, the head perhaps from an\r\nAntinous. The shepherdess has been reading Richardson, if not Jean\r\nJacques, and they both take life very seriously.\r\n\r\nWe find, however, the Chelsea-Derby mark on enamelled figures that\r\ndiffer little from the earlier and more frivolous type. These survivals,\r\nas it were, of the rococo school stand no longer upon a scroll pediment,\r\nbut on a rocky ground, amid careful reproductions of natural objects,\r\nstumps of trees, shells, or what not. The colours, too, have become\r\nsomewhat stronger; the pale, greenish blue of the earlier pieces is\r\nreplaced by a fuller turquoise hue.\r\n\r\nIt was at this time, or a little later, that the process of ‘casting’\r\nwas introduced for these statuettes. This was a process of English\r\norigin, though it is now extensively used at Sèvres and elsewhere\r\nabroad. We have described the various modifications of this plan in a\r\nprevious chapter (p. 25). In the case of these statuettes, the figure is\r\nfirst modelled in tough clay; the head and limbs are then cut off. A\r\nplaster-of-Paris mould is then made of each of the separate parts, a\r\ncream-like slip is poured into the mould and quickly poured out before\r\nall the water is absorbed, a layer of the paste remaining on the sides\r\nof the mould. This layer is detached when sufficiently dry; the pieces\r\nare then joined together by means of the same slip, and the outline of\r\nthe figure sharpened with a modelling tool.[234] Porcelain made by this\r\ncasting process is not so dense as that made on the old system; its\r\nspecific gravity is appreciably lower. The moulding or repairing knife\r\nmay be, to some extent, replaced by the use of a brush, but a less sharp\r\noutline is obtained in this case. In the furnace these figures have to\r\nbe supported by an elaborate scaffolding of props, and the shrinkage of\r\nthe clay during the firing is another source of difficulty.\r\n\r\nIn the British Museum may be seen a garniture of vases, of a type very\r\ncharacteristic of the early Chelsea-Derby time. A pale turquoise ground\r\nis overlaid with white flowers in low relief. This is but a modification\r\nof the German _schnee-ball_ decoration. Somewhat later the _pâte tendre_\r\nof Sèvres is evidently taken as a model, as in the _cabaret_ which was\r\ngiven by Queen Charlotte to one of her maids of honour. This ‘equipage,’\r\nto give it its English name, has also found its way into our national\r\ncollection. It has the rare jonquil ground with a border of blue and\r\ngold.\r\n\r\nFor smaller objects, for cups, saucers, and plates, a simpler style of\r\ndecoration is in favour. The wreaths of little blue flowers,\r\nforget-me-nots, and corn-flowers (the French _barbeau_), relieved with\r\ntouches of green and gold, remind one of the similar ware made at\r\nSèvres, and more especially at some of the smaller Parisian factories\r\nduring the early years of Louis XVI.\r\n\r\nThe elaborately decorated ‘old Japan’ was much copied at Derby, but so\r\nunintelligently that the patterns degenerated into meaningless forms,\r\nknown as ‘rock Japan,’ ‘witches Japan,’ and even ‘Grecian Japan’! This\r\nwas the beginning of a barbarous style of decoration, in vogue in the\r\nStaffordshire potteries at a later time both for porcelain and\r\nearthenware, in which scattered members of the original scheme are\r\njumbled together at the whim of the ignorant painter.[235]\r\n\r\nThe subsequent vicissitudes of the Derby factory may be traced in the\r\nmarks in use at successive dates. The combined anchor and D was\r\napparently employed at Chelsea as long as the factory existed, but at\r\nDerby a crown with jewelled bows was introduced in 1773 (PL. E. 75),\r\nperhaps on the occasion of some _velléité_ of royal patronage, although\r\nwe have no definite evidence of anything of the kind.[236]\r\n\r\nSomewhat later we find two batons crossed, with three dots in each angle\r\n(similar to the ‘billiard’ mark on some Dutch porcelain) inserted on\r\nDerby porcelain between the crown and the letter D (PL. E. 74).\r\n\r\nWilliam Duesbury died in 1786. His son, the second William, shortly\r\nbefore his death in 1796, took into partnership Michael Kean, a\r\nminiature-painter, and now a K was combined with the D on the mark. In\r\n1813 the factory was leased to Robert Bloor by the third William\r\nDuesbury, and after that time we hear no more of that family in\r\nconnection with Derby. Bloor conducted the works on ‘business\r\nprinciples’ until his death in 1846. If for nothing else, his name\r\nshould be remembered in connection with a wonderfully brilliant claret,\r\nor _rouge d’or_, that he succeeded in making. There is a vase with this\r\nground in the Jermyn Street collection which has excited the admiration\r\nof foreign experts. Bloor used the old mark, in red, up to 1831 at\r\nleast. Before that time, however, the crown had lost the jewels upon its\r\nbows. At this period china-clay and china-stone were more and more used,\r\nand the porcelain became harder and somewhat opaque. As a consequence\r\nof the higher melting, or rather softening, points of both body and\r\nglaze, the enamels lost something of their brilliancy and lustre.\r\n\r\nThe present porcelain factory at Derby cannot strictly be regarded as a\r\ndirect descendant of the old works on the Nottingham Road, whose career\r\ncame to an end after Bloor’s death in 1846.\r\n\r\n\r\nWORCESTER.--We have seen how William Duesbury, an obscure and illiterate\r\npainter of china images from the Staffordshire potteries, had after the\r\nabsorption of the factories of Chelsea and Bow (as well probably as that\r\nestablished by Littler in Duesbury’s own country) become a kind of china\r\nking.\r\n\r\nThere was one factory, however, skilfully managed and established on a\r\nfirm financial basis which remained entirely independent of him. Of the\r\norigin of this factory--the Worcester China Works--we have, quite\r\nexceptionally, a full record. These works, we may add, are also\r\nexceptional in another respect--they have had a continuous history from\r\nthe year of their foundation to the present day, that is to say for more\r\nthan a century and a half. Mr. R. W. Binns has in his possession a copy\r\nof the articles of association ‘for carrying on the Worcester Tonquin\r\nmanufacture.’[237] They are dated January 4, 1751. The forty-five shares\r\nof £100 each were divided among fifteen original partners, of whom two\r\nclaim to possess the secret, art, mystery, and process of making\r\nporcelain. These two were John Wall, doctor of medicine, and William\r\nDavis, apothecary. We have no record of the preliminary experiments said\r\nto have been made by these two men in a laboratory over the apothecary’s\r\nshop, nor do we know for how long these experiments had been carried\r\non. Two workmen, however, who had already been employed by them for some\r\ntime, were retained by the new company and well paid as an inducement to\r\nkeep secret the process of manufacture. It was the apothecary Davis,\r\nprobably, who brought the scientific knowledge, but Dr. Wall also,\r\nbesides being a portrait-painter who had acquired some renown at Oxford\r\nand in his native town (he had made designs for painted glass among\r\nother things), was an energetic, practical man with some scientific\r\npretensions; nor must we forget the two workmen, who probably had a good\r\ndeal to say in the matter.\r\n\r\nA site for the new factory was found in Warmstry House, a fine old\r\nmansion that had belonged to the Windsor family, situated some hundred\r\nyards to the north of the cathedral, and the kilns were erected in the\r\ngrounds which sloped down to the river. The biscuit kiln and the\r\nglazing-kiln were enclosed in long roofed buildings apparently without\r\nconspicuous chimneys. Only the great kiln for the ‘segurs’ takes the\r\nconical shape that we associate with pottery-ovens.[238] The pressing,\r\nmodelling, and throwing galleries were established in the old house\r\nitself, where there was also a ‘secret room.’\r\n\r\nThe little that we know of the composition of the paste, or rather\r\npastes, for there were two or more varieties used for the fine and\r\ncommon ware respectively, is derived from a paper (now in the possession\r\nof Mr. Binns) drawn up in 1764 by Richard Holdship, one of the original\r\npartners. In that year Holdship (he was an engraver who had been\r\nassociated with the introduction of the transfer process) became\r\nbankrupt, and now entered the service of Duesbury and Heath at Derby.\r\nFrom this paper we learn that the ordinary paste used at Worcester\r\ncontained about two-thirds of a glassy material (a mixture of\r\nflint-glass, crown-glass, and a specially prepared frit), and one-third\r\nof a soapy rock, that is to say of a steatite, from Cornwall. The\r\ncomposition of the glaze is interesting:--it contained, besides the\r\nusual constituents, 14 per cent. of ‘foreign china,’ 2½ per cent. of\r\n‘tin-ashes,’ and 0·3 per cent. of smalt. We should add that on the whole\r\nthe glaze of Worcester china is somewhat harder than that of other\r\nEnglish soft-paste wares. Along with this recipe is ‘a process for\r\nmaking porcelain ware, without soapy rock or glass, in imitation of\r\nNanquin, being an opaque body.’ This ‘Nanquin’ ware was made by mixing\r\nbone-ash with an equal weight of a very silicious frit: to the mixture 8\r\nper cent. of Barnstaple clay and a small quantity of smalt were added.\r\n\r\nWe learn from other sources (_e.g._ Borlase’s _History of Cornwall_,\r\n1758) that the agents of the Worcester company were busy searching for\r\nand purchasing steatite rock, especially at Mullion, in the Lizard\r\ndistrict.[239]\r\n\r\nOf the porcelain produced during the first sixteen years of the\r\nWorcester factory we know a little more than of that of the\r\ncorresponding time at Derby. This was an eclectic period: the wares (and\r\nthe marks also) of Chantilly, Meissen, and Chelsea were copied. It was\r\nthe Oriental models, however, that were most in favour, especially the\r\nblue and white of China, small pieces of which were imitated with some\r\nsuccess. For the enamelled ware, the brocaded Imari, our ‘old Japan,’\r\nrather than the older Kakiyemon ware, served as a type. At this time,\r\ntoo, a strange attempt was made to copy the marks of the Chinese\r\nporcelain. We can trace, sometimes, the well-known characters of the\r\nMing dynasty (‘great’ and ‘bright’) (PL. E. 76). In other cases Arabic\r\nnumerals are arranged so as roughly to resemble a Chinese character. The\r\nidea was probably taken from old Delft ware on which similar marks are\r\nfound, as also occasionally on Bow and on some Salopian porcelain.\r\nAgain, we find a degenerate seal character, perhaps derived from the\r\npopular Japanese mark _Fu_ (happiness), taking a form something like the\r\ndesign of a Union Jack (PL. E. 78). The decoration of the Chinese\r\n_famille rouge_ was also copied--we find it, for example, on the edges\r\nof little white cups and bowls with basket-work designs in low relief,\r\nof which there are some specimens at South Kensington.\r\n\r\nTo an early period, also, belongs the ware decorated in black (or less\r\noften in lilac), with figures and landscapes, ‘transferred’ by a variety\r\nof ingenious processes, which we need not describe here, from an\r\nengraved copper-plate. Used before this time on enamels at Battersea and\r\non earthenware at Liverpool, it was with the ‘jet enamelled’ ware of\r\nWorcester, printed from the plates specially made for the purpose by\r\nRobert Hancock (who had previously been employed at Battersea under the\r\nFrenchman Ravenet), that the new process was above all associated. Here,\r\nfor the first time perhaps in its history, porcelain was ‘made to\r\nspeak,’ to use Napoleon’s phrase. On it the hero of the day was\r\nimmortalised: in 1757 we find Frederick the Great, crowned by a winged\r\nGenius; at a later time the Marquis of Granby and the elder Pitt. It is\r\nHancock, it would seem, that we must regard as the _capo scuola_ of\r\nanother ‘school of decoration,’ one which, spreading at a later time to\r\nStaffordshire, has been carried to all parts of the world where\r\ntransfer-printed English crockery has penetrated. The basis of this\r\ndecoration is a classical ruin--generally a fragment of the entablature\r\nof a Roman temple supported on a few columns; add to this a pointed\r\nbuilding something between an obelisk and a pyramid,[240] the whole\r\nenclosed in a framework of conventional trees. Upon how many millions of\r\njugs and basins was this pattern repeated, in black, in green, and in\r\nlilac! At some future day, by the study of potsherds so decorated\r\ncollected in many lands, an archæologist may be able to trace the course\r\nof English commerce in the nineteenth century, and to draw strange\r\ninferences as to the state of the arts at that time in our country.\r\n\r\nThis ‘jet-enamelled’ transfer was printed over the glaze; sometimes, to\r\nenliven the effect, other colours, painted by hand, were added, with\r\ndisastrous results. In the blue and white printed ware, on the other\r\nhand, the cobalt pigment is applied under the glaze. The paste of this\r\ntransfer-printed porcelain is often of good quality and very\r\ntranslucent, and the finer earlier specimens are much sought after by\r\ncollectors. We have seen that at least from the _cultur-historisch_\r\npoint of view this printed china is not without interest.\r\n\r\nAfter 1763 Sprimont’s factory at Chelsea was only working at irregular\r\nintervals. Some time later, about 1768, many of the enamel-painters\r\nmigrated to Worcester, where capable artists seem to have been in great\r\ndemand. It is usual to attribute to this migration a new scheme of\r\ndecoration that came into vogue at Worcester in the seventies. This was\r\nthe period of the vases with deep blue grounds and panels brilliantly\r\npainted with flowers and bright-plumaged tropical birds. The _bleu du\r\nroi_ ground (we must remember that, like the similar grounds at Chelsea\r\nand Longport, this pigment was painted _sous couverte_) is often\r\ncovered with the salmon-scales in a deeper tint so characteristic of the\r\nperiod; at other times it is replaced by a _poudré_ blue. The hand of\r\nthe Chelsea artist is to be recognised in the decoration of the panels,\r\nbut the vases are generally of simple contours, often octagonal and, on\r\nthe whole, following Chinese shapes. It is this richly decorated ware,\r\nproduced especially between 1770 and 1780, which now commands such\r\nextravagant prices in the London market.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the new classical forms already in favour at Derby\r\nand in France were not as yet adopted at Worcester--they came in later,\r\nand then in a more debased form. In fact, the special mark of this, the\r\nfinest period in these works, is the application of a rich style of\r\npainting that we generally associate with rococo shapes, to vases which\r\notherwise retain the form and decoration of their Chinese prototypes.\r\nSomewhat later, from Sèvres, no doubt, came the canary yellow, generally\r\npoor in tone and of uneven strength. The simple floral wreaths of the\r\nLouis XVI. period are here represented by the pretty ‘trellis’ design,\r\ngreen festoons hanging from reddish poles (PL. XLVI.).\r\n\r\nMuch of the Worcester porcelain was from an early time decorated in\r\nLondon. In 1768 we find Mr. J. Giles (no doubt the ‘Mr. Gyles of Kentish\r\nTown’ to whose kiln Thomas Craft took his famous punch-bowl to be\r\n‘burnt’ at a charge of 3s.) described in an advertisement as ‘china and\r\nenamel painter, proprietor of the Worcester Porcelain Warehouse, up one\r\npair of stairs in Cockspur Street.’ Here the nobility and gentry may\r\nfind ‘articles useful and ornamental curiously painted in the Dresden,\r\nChelsea, and Chinese taste.’\r\n\r\nAt a later time the Baxter family occupied much the same position as\r\nGiles. The elder Baxter had\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PLATE XLVI._ WORCESTER]\r\n\r\nworkshops at Goldsmith Street, Gough Square,[241] and here white\r\nporcelain from many sources was decorated. There is a curious\r\nwater-colour drawing, representing the interior of this workshop, at\r\nSouth Kensington. It is the work of the younger Baxter, famous in his\r\nday as a painter on porcelain. The pale, anæmic faces of the\r\nartists--one of them wears a large pair of spectacles--crouching over\r\ntheir work in a narrow, crowded room, may be taken as evidence that this\r\noccupation was injurious both to the eyesight and to the general health\r\n(PL. LXVII.).\r\n\r\nTo return to the general history of the Worcester factory. In 1770 we\r\nhear of a strike among the painters, who were alarmed at the spread of\r\nthe underglaze printing process. The movement was not unconnected,\r\nprobably, with the introduction of new blood from Chelsea. In 1772 there\r\nwas a general shuffling-up and reorganisation of the company, with the\r\nresult that Dr. Wall and the two Davises, father and son, finally gained\r\npossession of nearly all the shares. But the doctor died in 1776, and\r\nseven years later the whole concern was sold to Mr. Flight, a London\r\njeweller, who had previously acted as agent for the company. At the same\r\ntime Chamberlain, an original apprentice, and a man who had taken a\r\nleading part of late in the artistic management, seceded from the\r\ncompany, and, with his son, set up an independent manufactory.\r\n\r\nAfter the visit of George III. to the works in 1788, the factory became\r\n‘Royal,’ and this is, perhaps, the nearest approach to a royal patronage\r\nthat we can find in the history of English porcelain. In time the\r\nChamberlain offshoot came to flourish more than the original stock, and\r\nfinally, in 1840, the older firm, then known as ‘Flight and Barr,’ was\r\nabsorbed by it. Towards the end of the eighteenth century many\r\nmagnificent services of china were made for the royal family, painted\r\nwith finished pictures in the style admired at the time. The porcelain\r\nwas again ‘made to speak.’ In answer to the Napoleonic victories figured\r\non the ware of Sèvres, we in England painted naval emblems and portraits\r\nof Lord Nelson on our plates and dishes.\r\n\r\nThe joint-stock company which now owns the Worcester factory was founded\r\nin 1862. Since that time great efforts have been made to keep on a level\r\nwith the artistic movements of the day. Much attention has been paid to\r\nthe modelling of the handles, the stands and the covers of the vases, so\r\nthat some of them are works of art by themselves. The porcelain has been\r\ndesigned and decorated in ‘the style of the Italian renaissance,’ in the\r\n‘French style,’ then for a time a Japanese influence prevailed, to be\r\nfollowed by vases in ‘Persian style,’ and then back to the ‘Florentine\r\nrenaissance’ once more. But running through the whole, we may perhaps\r\ntrace a _soupçon_ of the French art of the later nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nApart from the imitative marks of the early period which we have already\r\nmentioned, we find at an early date the letter W, either for Wall or\r\nWorcester (so the D of the rival works may stand either for Derby or\r\nDuesbury). Another early mark, borrowed probably from Frye and the Bow\r\nworks, is the T. F. monogram which occurs on some underglaze blue and\r\nwhite pieces. The crescent (PL. E. 77), used up to 1793, is chiefly\r\nfound on ware decorated with transfer printing: when this printing is in\r\nblue under the glaze, a solid or ruled crescent is found. The later\r\nfirms, as ‘Flight and Barr’ and ‘Chamberlain,’ print their names in\r\nfull. A number of small marks found on Worcester china--more than\r\nseventy have been noted--were added in most cases to identify the\r\npainters and gilders.\r\n\r\n\r\nSMALLER WEST OF ENGLAND SOFT-PASTE FACTORIES.\r\n\r\nThis will be the most convenient place to say something of a small group\r\nof factories where china was made towards the end of the eighteenth\r\ncentury. It is a distinctly West of England family, owing its origin in\r\na measure to Worcester, but also forming a link between that factory and\r\nthe Staffordshire works. We include in it the Shropshire porcelains of\r\nCaughley and Coalbrookdale, together with Swansea and Nantgarw.\r\n\r\nCAUGHLEY.--The ‘Salopian Porcelain Works’ were started in 1772 at\r\nCaughley, near Broseley, in Shropshire, a neighbourhood long famous for\r\nits earthenware. It was here that Thomas Turner, a man of some social\r\nstanding who came from Worcester, devoted himself more especially to\r\nprinting in blue under the glaze. It was at Caughley, it would seem,\r\nabout 1780, that the famous ‘willow pattern’ was first used. There is in\r\nthe British Museum a curious little oblong dish that shows this design\r\nin an undeveloped form. Turner, it is said, first printed complete\r\ndinner-services, in dark blue, with this pattern. Not long after this he\r\nwent to France, and brought back a batch of French painters, whose\r\ninfluence may perhaps be seen in the ware made at a later time at\r\nCoalport. Some of the printed work is delicately executed, and when the\r\ndecoration is judiciously heightened with a little gilding, the effect\r\nis not unpleasing. We hear also of dinner-services painted with\r\n‘Chantille sprigs,’ and Turner also supplied Chamberlain with plain\r\nwhite ware to be subsequently decorated at Worcester. At a later time\r\nmuch gilding was applied to a richly decorated porcelain. Some of this\r\nware is stamped with the word ‘Salopian,’ other pieces have the letters\r\nS or C printed or painted under the glaze; but both Dresden and even\r\nWorcester marks were also used. Two men, at a later time representatives\r\nof the industrial phase of porcelain, John Rose and Thomas Minton, were\r\ntrained in these short-lived works.\r\n\r\nCOALPORT OR COALBROOKDALE.--Here, on the left bank of the Severn, nearly\r\nopposite the last-named factory, John Rose began making porcelain soon\r\nafter 1780. In 1799 he purchased from Turner (whose apprentice he had\r\nbeen) the Caughley works, and in 1814 he removed the whole plant to\r\nCoalbrookdale. Here, too, came Billingsley after the closing of the\r\nNantgarw works, and here he worked till his death in 1828. During the\r\nfirst half of the nineteenth century the firm of John Rose and Company\r\nwas a successful rival to the Davenports, Mintons, and Copelands. Rose\r\nexcelled in the production of gorgeous vases decorated with picture\r\npanels, and Billingsley kept up the supply of his English roses. The\r\nolder wares of Sèvres and Chelsea were copied not unsuccessfully, and\r\nthe appropriate mark was not omitted. The firm seems to have above all\r\nprided itself upon the beauty of its _rose Pompadour_ grounds, and at a\r\nlater time, after 1850, both this ground and the turquoise blue were\r\nlargely applied to the pseudo-Sèvres porcelain that found its way to the\r\nLondon china-shops. In 1820 Rose was granted a medal by the Society of\r\nArts for a leadless glaze, compounded of felspar and borax. The factory\r\nat Coalport continues to produce much china on the same lines.\r\n\r\nNear at hand, at Madeley, some very close imitations of the old Sèvres\r\nwere made by Randall between 1830 and 1840. For the origin of this\r\nEnglish Sèvres we must go back to the year 1813, when we hear of the\r\nagents of London dealers buying up white and slightly decorated Sèvres\r\nsoft paste. Any enamel colour on them was removed by hydrofluoric acid,\r\nand the surface was richly decorated in the Pompadour style. Randall\r\nsoon after this time was engaged with similar work in London: his\r\nturquoise blues are especially praised.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate XLVII\r\n\r\n_Water-colour Drawing. Enamel Painters at work._]\r\n\r\nSWANSEA AND NANTGARW.--At the beginning of the nineteenth century some\r\nworks at Swansea, where a so-called ‘opaque porcelain’ had been lately\r\nmanufactured, were purchased by Mr. Lewis W. Dillwyn. Mr. Dillwyn was a\r\nkeen naturalist: he induced Mr. Young, a draughtsman who had been\r\nemployed by him in illustrating works on natural history, to learn the\r\nart of enamel-painting on porcelain. Young devoted himself to painting\r\nbirds, shells, and above all butterflies. In spite of the aim at\r\nscientific accuracy, the artistic effect of these delicately painted\r\nbutterflies, scattered here and there over the dead white paste, is not\r\nunpleasant. There were some good specimens of this form of decoration in\r\nthe old Jermyn Street collection, but most of them, I think, are not\r\npainted on a true porcelain.\r\n\r\nMeantime, at Nantgarw (_Anglicè_ Nantgarrow), some ten miles north of\r\nCardiff, a small porcelain factory had been established by one William\r\nBeely and his son-in-law, Samuel Walker.\r\n\r\nMr. Dillwyn, who visited the Nantgarw works in 1814, at the instigation\r\nof his friend Sir Joseph Banks, found these two men making an admirable\r\nsoft-paste porcelain, remarkable for its translucency. ‘I agreed with\r\nthem,’ so Mr. Dillwyn reported, ‘for a removal to the Cambrian pottery\r\n[_i.e._ to Swansea], where two new kilns were prepared under their\r\ndirection. When endeavouring to improve and strengthen this beautiful\r\nbody, I was surprised at receiving a notice from Messrs. Flight and Barr\r\nof Worcester, charging the parties calling themselves Walker and Beely\r\nwith having clandestinely left an engagement at their works.’\r\n\r\nBeely was in fact no other than Billingsley, the wandering artist and\r\n‘arcanist’ who in 1774 was apprenticed to Duesbury at Derby, and had\r\nthere learned the art of painting flowers on porcelain. We hear that in\r\n1793 he was also landlord of the ‘Nottingham Arms,’ but in spite, or\r\nperhaps rather in consequence, of thus having two strings to his bow,\r\nhe soon after left Derby, and for twenty years led a roving life. In\r\n1796 he was at Pinxton, and it was here, says Mr. W. Turner (_The\r\nCeramics of Swansea and Nantgarw_), whom I now follow, that he perfected\r\nhis famous granulated frit body. Then follows an obscure period, during\r\nwhich we hear of Billingsley at Mansfield, and again as a china\r\nmanufacturer at Torksey, in Lincolnshire. Finally, in 1808, he settled\r\ndown to work at Worcester under the name of Beely. His later migrations\r\nto Nantgarw, to Swansea, and finally to Coalport, we have already\r\nreferred to.\r\n\r\nThree years after Billingsley’s removal to Swansea, the manufacture of\r\nporcelain was abandoned by Mr. Dillwyn: this was in 1817, barely six\r\nyears from the time when Billingsley started the Nantgarw works.\r\n\r\nIt is not quite certain whether the marks that distinguish the two\r\nwares--‘Nantgarw’ above the letters ‘C. W.’ in one case, ‘Swansea’\r\nsometimes with the addition of a trident (PL. E. 80) in the other--can\r\nalways be relied on to distinguish the two factories: the former mark\r\nmay have continued in use after the removal to Swansea.\r\n\r\nThe paste of some of the ware made at Swansea was very different from\r\nthat of Billingsley’s glassy porcelain. We know that both china-clay and\r\nsteatite from the Lizard were employed here, producing a somewhat hard\r\nand opaque body.\r\n\r\nApart from their paste, renowned for its absolute whiteness and\r\nconsiderable translucency, Billingsley and his pupils, Pardoe and\r\nWalker, have acquired a certain fame by their enamel-painting on this\r\nNantgarw porcelain. Life-size roses, auriculas, tulips, and lilies were\r\ntheir favourite flowers. This was the culmination, as it were, of the\r\nschool that delighted above all in the double rose, a not very paintable\r\nflower, at least in a decorative point of view. We saw its beginnings at\r\nDerby more than thirty years before this time. But Baxter the younger,\r\nwhom we have come across at his father’s workshop in Gough Square,\r\npainted figure-subjects on the Swansea porcelain, and some of the\r\ntranslucent ware of the Nantgarw type was sent up to London unenamelled,\r\nthere to be converted into the old soft paste of Sèvres.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBefore we return to the West of England to treat of the true hard\r\nporcelain of Plymouth and Bristol, there remain to be mentioned briefly\r\na few unimportant factories of soft paste--unimportant, that is, from\r\nthe point of view of art.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOWESTOFT.--Taking advantage of some suitable clay found in the\r\nneighbourhood, and of the fine silvery sand of the shore, a manufactory\r\nof soft paste was established at Lowestoft about 1756. Later on we find\r\nsome references to a ‘Lowestoft Porcelain Company.’ The ware produced\r\nwas chiefly blue and white, with views of the neighbourhood, but other\r\nsmall pieces are found crudely painted in colour. The execution of much\r\nof this ware is very summary, and the glaze is often dull and spotted. A\r\nblue and white plate in the British Museum, with _poudré_ ground and\r\npanels painted with views of Lowestoft and the neighbourhood, is an\r\nunusually favourable specimen. More commonly we find jugs and ink-pots\r\nwith inscriptions--‘A Trifle from Lowestoft,’ etc.--and with dates in\r\none or two cases ranging from 1762 to 1789. Whether any hard porcelain\r\nfrom other sources was ever painted at Lowestoft is very doubtful.[242]\r\n\r\nThe ‘Lowestoft porcelain’ of the dealers is now known to have been\r\npainted by Chinese artists at Canton. That this is so was conclusively\r\nproved many years ago by Sir A. W. Franks. The thrashing out of the\r\nquestion had the advantage of throwing much light on the origin of this\r\ncurious pseudo-European decoration. The greater part of this porcelain\r\npainted at Canton is covered with elaborate armorial designs, and it was\r\nmade not only for England but for other European countries that traded\r\nwith the East. The history of this Sinico-European ware is well\r\nillustrated in a large collection brought together chiefly by the late\r\nSir A. W. Franks and now in the British Museum.[243]\r\n\r\nLIVERPOOL.--Pottery had been an article of export from Liverpool from an\r\nearly date, and much of the ware exported (it went above all to America)\r\nwas made in the neighbourhood. During the sixties of the eighteenth\r\ncentury more than one of the local potters began to make a soft-paste\r\nporcelain. One of these men--Richard Chaffers--we find scouring the\r\ncounty of Cornwall in search of soap-stone and china-clay, as early\r\nprobably as the year 1755. Professor Church gives the recipe for the\r\n‘china body’ used in 1769 by another potter--Pennington. The materials\r\nare bone-ash, Lynn sand, flint, and clay,[244] the latter probably from\r\nCornwall.\r\n\r\nThere is a good deal of uncertainty as to the identification of the\r\nLiverpool china: some of it has perhaps been classed as Worcester or\r\nSalopian. Examples of the ware attributed to this town may be found at\r\nSouth Kensington; they are somewhat rudely printed in a heavy dark blue.\r\nBut it is probable that very little true porcelain was made at Liverpool\r\nin the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\nEarly in the next century an important factory for pottery and\r\nporcelain was founded on the opposite side of the Mersey, and thither\r\nmany workmen were brought from Staffordshire. Porcelain was made there\r\nuntil the year 1841. The ware was marked ‘Herculaneum,’ the name of the\r\nworks. We find at times a bird holding a branch in its beak used as a\r\nmark. This is the ‘liver,’ the crest of the town of Liverpool. The\r\nliver, indeed, is occasionally found on ware of an earlier date.\r\n\r\nPINXTON.--Our chief interest in the factory established in 1795 at\r\nPinxton, on the borders of Derbyshire and Northampton, by John Coke, is\r\nderived from the temporary residence there of Billingsley. This was his\r\nfirst stopping-place after leaving the Derby works: here he remained\r\nuntil 1801, and it was here, probably, that he developed the ‘china\r\nbody’ used by him afterwards at Nantgarw. There were some pleasing\r\nspecimens of the Pinxton ware in the old Jermyn Street collection simply\r\ndecorated with ‘French twigs’ in blue and green. The ice-pail at South\r\nKensington, with canary ground and frieze of roses, illustrated in\r\nProfessor Church’s little book, was probably painted by Billingsley.\r\n\r\nAt CHURCH GRESLEY, in the extreme south of Derbyshire, an ambitious\r\nattempt to make a porcelain of high quality nearly ruined Sir Nigel\r\nGresley, the representative of the old family long settled there. This\r\nwas in 1795, and after three successive owners had sunk their fortunes\r\nin the factory, the works were finally closed in 1808. I can point to no\r\nexample of porcelain that can with certainty be attributed to these\r\nkilns. Pottery and encaustic tiles are, however, still made in the\r\ndistrict.\r\n\r\nROCKINGHAM PORCELAIN.--At Swinton, in the West Riding of Yorkshire, not\r\nfar from Sheffield, pottery-works were established in the eighteenth\r\ncentury on the estates of the Wentworth family. These potteries were\r\ncalled after the Marquis of Rockingham, who was more than once at the\r\nhead of the Government, and the name was carried over to the porcelain\r\nwhich was made there by Thomas Brameld in the next century. This\r\nfactory was in existence from 1820 to 1842, and the ware turned out well\r\nrepresents the taste of the time. ‘Brameld,’ we are told, ‘spared no\r\nlabour or cost in bringing his porcelain to perfection, and in the\r\npainting and gilding he employed the best artists.’ The ornate\r\ndinner-services made by him for William IV. and other royal personages\r\nprobably surpassed in elaborate decoration and expense of production\r\nanything of the kind ever made in England. At South Kensington is a\r\ngigantic vase--it is more than three feet in height,--on the top is a\r\ngilt rhinoceros, an oak branch embraces the sides, the base is modelled\r\nin the form of three paws, and the whole body of the vase is covered\r\nwith a series of highly finished pictures, chiefly flower pieces. This\r\nvase is a unique example of everything that should be avoided in the\r\nmodelling and decoration of porcelain. On some of the Rockingham china\r\nwe find a griffin as a mark, in honour of Lord Fitzwilliam, who had\r\nsucceeded to the Wentworth estates on the death of his uncle, Lord\r\nRockingham.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAlready, at the commencement of the nineteenth century, the manufacture\r\nof porcelain in England was beginning to be concentrated in the hands of\r\na few large firms in the pottery district of North Staffordshire, and\r\nhere a definite type of ‘china body’ was established suitable for\r\npractical use. Bone-ash mixed with china-stone and china-clay from\r\nCornwall were and still remain the essential constituents of this paste:\r\nto these materials ground flints are sometimes added.\r\n\r\nAlthough it is apart from our purpose to trace the history of the great\r\nStaffordshire firms, we must say a word of one family--the Spodes of\r\nStoke-upon-Trent. The firm founded by them was in a measure the common\r\ncentre from which the later establishments had their origin. Josiah\r\nSpode the elder had been making pottery of various kinds at Stoke since\r\nthe year 1749; he it was who introduced the blue willow pattern to the\r\nStaffordshire potteries. It was to his son, the second Josiah, that the\r\ncredit of first using bone-ash as an ingredient of porcelain was so long\r\nascribed. The statement thus put is of course absurd. His real merit lay\r\nin abandoning the use of a frit and adopting a china-body consisting\r\nsimply of a mixture of china-stone and china-clay from Cornwall, with a\r\nlarge proportion of bone-ash, and thus settling once for all the\r\ncomposition of the industrial porcelain of England, a ware differing in\r\nmany respects from the eighteenth century soft pastes, and one capable\r\nof being manufactured on a large scale without the risks that always\r\nattended the firing of the latter. His ‘felspar porcelain,’ often so\r\nmarked, is of less consequence, but by using pure felspar instead of\r\nchina-stone he forestalled the practice since adopted by many\r\ncontinental works, where felspar of Scandinavian origin is now largely\r\nused.\r\n\r\nLater on, when William Copeland joined the firm, they became the most\r\nimportant makers of porcelain and earthenware in England, and the\r\nContinent was inundated with their wares. The founder of the rival firm\r\nof Minton was a Shropshire man: at the end of the eighteenth century he\r\nhad been apprenticed to Turner at Caughley, and he, too, worked at one\r\ntime in the Spode factory. At a later date both firms claimed the credit\r\nfor the invention of an improved kind of biscuit, the Parian ware, of\r\nwhich much was heard about the middle of the last century.\r\n\r\nThere is at South Kensington a representative collection of the finer\r\nSpode wares, presented by a niece of the second Josiah. Great technical\r\nperfection was attained, and the enamel colours are remarkably brilliant\r\nand effective. I have already referred to a large tray, on which the\r\nbrocade pattern of the old Imari is seen in the last stage of decay. The\r\nelements of the design have fallen to pieces, and lie helplessly\r\nscattered over the surface. Yet this is a carefully finished piece, and\r\nthe enamels are of good quality. I take this tray as a typical example\r\nof a style of decoration with coloured enamels both on porcelain and\r\nearthenware which prevailed not many years ago on wares in domestic use.\r\nAlong with the transfer-printed _camaïeu_ mentioned on page 360, these\r\nwares found their way to most parts of Europe and America.\r\n\r\nBELLEEK.--Probably the last attempt that has been made with us to\r\nestablish a new factory of porcelain was at Belleek, near Lough Erne, in\r\nnorthern Ireland. Here, under the direction of Mr. Armstrong, a very\r\nfine and translucent paste was first made in 1857, and a peculiar\r\nnacreous lustre was given to the ware by the use of a glaze prepared\r\nwith a salt of bismuth. The local felspar was employed together with\r\nchina-clay brought from Cornwall. Some care was given to the modelling\r\nin imitation of shells and corals. Little of this ware, which may be\r\nclassed as a hard-paste porcelain, has been made of recent years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nENGLISH PORCELAIN--(_continued_).\r\n\r\nTHE HARD PASTE OF PLYMOUTH AND BRISTOL\r\n\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of true porcelain had but a short life in England. The\r\nware has no especial artistic merit, nor was it ever commercially of\r\nmuch importance. And yet in the history of this short-lived attempt to\r\nimitate the porcelain of China and Saxony, we find so many points (in\r\nthe composition and technique of the ware above all) that illustrate and\r\nconfirm what we have said in some early chapters, that we shall have to\r\nfollow up this history somewhat closely.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the two men, thanks to whose energy and scientific knowledge\r\nthe difficulties attending the first manufacture of the new substance\r\nwere overcome, interest us in more ways than one. There is, in the first\r\nplace, Cookworthy the quaker, who, once he had solved the practical\r\nproblem that had hitherto baffled all the potters and arcanists of\r\nEngland and France, was content to return to a quiet life among the\r\nlittle _coterie_ of ‘friends’ at Plymouth. The other is Champion, the\r\nfriend of Burke, who, after his business had been ruined by the American\r\nWar, preferred to end his life as a farmer in the new country, with\r\nwhose struggle for independence he had throughout sympathised.\r\n\r\nThe two letters of the Père D’Entrecolles on the manufacture of\r\nporcelain in China were known through their publication in Du Halde’s\r\ncollection soon after the date (1722) at which the second one was\r\nwritten. The search for the essential constituents of a true porcelain\r\nat once began. One of the first results of this search was the\r\nappearance of the ‘Unaker, the produce of the Cherokee nation of\r\nAmerica,’ which is mentioned in Frye’s patent of 1744. Shortly after the\r\nmiddle of the century, as we learn from Borlase’s _History of Cornwall_\r\n(published in 1758), the attention of more than one manufacturer of\r\nporcelain was directed to that county. But no one probably was so well\r\nequipped for the search as William Cookworthy, the druggist of\r\nPlymouth--he was already thoroughly acquainted with the geology of the\r\ncounty. Cookworthy, too, must have carefully studied the letters of the\r\nJesuit missionary. In the memoir written by him at a later date (it is\r\ngiven in full in Owen’s _Two Centuries of Ceramic Art at Bristol_) he\r\nclearly distinguishes ‘the _petunse_, the _Caulin_, and the _Wha-she_,’\r\nor soapy rock.[245]\r\n\r\nIn fact it is this that gives to Cookworthy so important a place in the\r\nhistory of porcelain. He was probably the first in Europe to attack\r\npractically, and finally to conquer, the problem of making a true\r\nporcelain strictly on the lines of the Chinese as interpreted by the\r\nPère D’Entrecolles. Böttger’s success, if one is to accept the official\r\nGerman account, was rather the result of some happy accident--an\r\naccident, it is true, of which only a man of genius knows how to avail\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nCookworthy had his attention directed to the subject by an American\r\nquaker, of whom he writes, in May 1745: ‘I had lately with me the person\r\nwho hath discovered the China-earth. He had several examples of the\r\nChina ware of their making with him, which were, I think, equal to the\r\nAsiatic; ... having read Du Halde, he discovered both the China-stone\r\nand the Caulin.’[246]\r\n\r\nBoth the petuntse and the ‘Caulin’ were first identified by Cookworthy\r\nat Tregonnin Hill (between Marazion and Helston)--this was about 1750.\r\nThe nature and mode of occurrence of both the growan or moor-stone and\r\nof the growan clay, to use the local names, are admirably described by\r\nhim. Soon after this he found the two materials at St. Stephen’s,\r\nbetween Truro and St. Austell, in the centre of what is now the great\r\nchina-clay district of Cornwall.\r\n\r\nThere must have been many experiments with the new materials, and many\r\nfailures, before the year 1768, when Cookworthy took out his patent, and\r\nwith the pecuniary assistance of Thomas Pitt of Boconnoc (later Lord\r\nCamelford) started his factory at Plymouth. It is doubtful whether this\r\nfactory was in existence for more than two years. In any case there is\r\nevidence that already, by the year 1770, the ‘Plymouth New Invented\r\nPorcelain Manufactory’ was at work at Bristol.\r\n\r\nWe have proof, too, that before this time Richard Champion and others\r\nhad been working in the latter town with the new Cornish materials.\r\nChampion had been asked by Lord Hyndford to make a report upon some\r\nkaolin sent to him from South Carolina. In his reply he says: ‘I had it\r\ntried at a manufactory set up some time ago on the principle of the\r\nChinese porcelain, but not being successful, is given up.... The\r\nproprietors of the works in Bristol imagined they had discovered in\r\nCornwall all the materials similar to the Chinese; but though they burnt\r\nthe body part tolerably well, yet there were impurities in the glaze or\r\nstone which were insurmountable even in the greatest fire they could\r\ngive it, and which was equal to the Glasshouse heat.... I have sent some\r\n[_i.e_. of the Carolina clay] to Worcester, but this and all the English\r\nporcelains being composed of frits, there is no probability of success.’\r\nThis is written in February 1766, before the date of Cookworthy’s\r\npatent.[247]\r\n\r\nMeantime, in France, two men of some scientific pretensions, both of\r\nthem members of the _Académie des Sciences_, Lauraguais[248] and\r\nD’Arcet, had discovered the kaolin deposits near Alençon. Lauraguais had\r\nsoon after 1760 succeeded in making some kind of porcelain with the\r\nmaterials he had found. He was, however, forestalled by Guettard, a\r\nrival chemist in the service of the Duke of Orleans, who in November\r\n1765 read a paper before the _Académie_ on the kaolin and petuntse of\r\nAlençon. Lauraguais, in disgust, after a violent rejoinder, came over to\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nIn a curious letter dated April 1766, Dr. Darwin, writing to Wedgwood,\r\nsays: ‘Count Laragaut has been at Birmingham & offer’d ye Secret of\r\nmaking ye finest old China as cheap as your Pots. He says ye materials\r\nare in England. That ye secret has cost £16,000--y^{t}He will sell it\r\nfor £2000--He is a Man of Science, dislikes his own Country, was six\r\nmonths in ye Bastile for speaking against ye Government--loves every\r\nthing English’; but, adds Darwin, ‘I suspect his Scientific Passion is\r\nstronger than perfect Sanity’ (Miss Meteyard, _Life of Wedgwood_, vol.\r\ni. p. 436). Lauraguais, in 1766, proposed to take out a patent for\r\nmaking not only the coarser species of china, but ‘the more beautiful\r\nware of the Indies and the finest of Japan.’ The specification was never\r\nenrolled, and nothing came of it. There exist, however, a few specimens\r\nof china marked with the letters B. L. (Brancas Lauraguais) in a flowing\r\nhand, which are attributed to the Count.[249] The paste, says Professor\r\nChurch, is fine, hard, and of good colour. An analysis gives 58 per\r\ncent. of silica, 36 per cent. of alumina, and 6 per cent. of other\r\nbases. It will be observed that the percentage of alumina in this\r\nporcelain is exceptionally high.\r\n\r\nWe see, therefore, that before the year 1770, when Cookworthy removed to\r\nBristol, true porcelain had been made in more than one place in England,\r\nbut not with enough success to allow the new ware to compete with the\r\nsoft pastes of Worcester and elsewhere. So in France, although the new\r\npaste was introduced at Sèvres in 1769, it was only in 1774, so\r\nBrongniart tells us, that the manufacture of hard porcelain was firmly\r\nestablished.\r\n\r\nChampion seems to have been on friendly terms with Cookworthy, and in\r\n1773 he bought from the latter the entire patent rights. In the two\r\nprevious years much of the new porcelain had been made. It is claimed\r\nfor it in advertisements that, unlike the English china generally, it\r\nwill wear as well as the East Indian, and that the enamelled porcelain,\r\nthough nearly as cheap as the English blue and white, ‘comes very near,\r\nand in some pieces equals, the Dresden, which this work more\r\nparticularly imitates.’ This is from a local journal of November 1772,\r\nand we may add that not only the ware was imitated, but also the\r\nwell-known marks of Dresden.[250]\r\n\r\nNow, if we turn from these general considerations to examine the nature\r\nof the West of England ware, we find some difficulty in drawing a line\r\nbetween the early, partly experimental, porcelain made at Plymouth and\r\nthe later, more successful, products of the Bristol kilns. Nor will the\r\nmark, the alchemist’s sign for Jupiter[251] (PL. E. 83), first used on\r\nthe Plymouth porcelain, help us much, for the same mark was certainly\r\nused to some extent after Cookworthy’s migration to Bristol.\r\n\r\nTo Plymouth we must attribute the plain white ware with a glaze of dull\r\nhue, disfigured by dark lines where the glaze lies thick in the\r\ninterstices. Cookworthy, we know, attempted to make his glaze from the\r\nCornish stone without the addition of any other substances.[252] In\r\nother cases he followed the recipe given by the Père D’Entrecolles, and\r\ngave greater fusibility to the growan-stone by adding a small quantity\r\nof a frit made from a mixture of lime and fern ashes. Cookworthy even\r\nventured to follow the Chinese plan, and applied the glaze to the raw\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PLATE XLVIII._ 1--PLYMOUTH, WHITE GLAZED WARE\r\n2--BRISTOL, COLOURED ENAMELS]\r\n\r\nor very slightly baked paste. The blue and white made by him, if we may\r\njudge from the little mug in the British Museum, with the arms of\r\nPlymouth and the date, March 14, 1768, was of very poor quality. The\r\nOriental designs on his enamelled porcelain seem to have come to him by\r\nway of Chantilly. More successful was the plain white ware modelled in\r\nrelief, in a way that often calls to mind the early work of Bow. A good\r\nexample is the ‘Tridacna’ salt-cellar in the former Jermyn Street\r\ncollection.\r\n\r\nAt least one French modeller and enameller was employed at Plymouth, and\r\nafter the removal to Bristol we find the name of a German also. Henry\r\nBone, a Truro man, who afterwards became famous as a miniature-painter\r\nin enamels, entered the works at Bristol as a lad, and passed there the\r\nsix years of his apprenticeship. Bone, who later on wrote R.A. after his\r\nname, was the principal representative in England of the school of\r\npainters in enamel upon slabs of porcelain, that played so important a\r\npart at Sèvres at the beginning of the last century. At one time a\r\nmodeller of some skill must have been employed. Perhaps this was the\r\nmysterious Soqui or Le Quoi.[253] Some little statuettes in the\r\nSchreiber collection at South Kensington, ‘the Seasons,’ as represented\r\nby boys and girls, are charmingly modelled. But we must not look for any\r\nbrilliancy of colour in the enamels. The highly infusible nature of the\r\npaste, and what is even more important, of the glaze, added immensely to\r\nthe difficulty of obtaining anything of the kind. If we compare the\r\nenamels on these statuettes with those on the Chelsea and Derby figures\r\nin the same collection, the difference is at once apparent. The two most\r\nimportant colours in the latter wares, the rose-pink and the turquoise,\r\nit was impossible to develop at the high temperature required to soften\r\nthe refractory glaze of the hard porcelain. The greens, however, and the\r\ncoral reds of the Bristol figures are more successful. In the\r\nspecifications of 1775 there is mention of a glaze containing much\r\nkaolin mixed with some arsenic and tin oxide.[254] Such a glaze might\r\nallow of more brilliancy in the enamels, and it is to be noticed in this\r\nconnection that some statuettes long classed as Chelsea have only\r\ncomparatively lately been recognised as consisting of the Bristol paste.\r\n\r\nPerhaps what we may regard as the most remarkable, certainly the most\r\noriginal, work produced by Champion are the little circular or oval\r\nplaques of white biscuit. These medallions vary from four to nine inches\r\nin diameter. The central field contains a coat-of-arms modelled in low\r\nrelief, or more rarely a portrait bust, and among these last we find\r\nheads of Benjamin Franklin and of George Washington, pointing to the\r\npolitical sympathies of Champion. A wreath of flowers in full relief\r\nsurrounds the field--the sharpness and the finish in the modelling of\r\nthese minute leaves and blossoms has never been approached in this or\r\nother material. In the manner of treatment, these wreaths are thoroughly\r\nEnglish, and we are reminded of the flowers carved in wood by Grinling\r\nGibbons (PL. XLIX.).\r\n\r\nChampion made also a commoner ware, which he called ‘cottage china.’\r\nThis was summarily decorated in colours without any gilding. The glaze\r\non this ware was applied over the raw paste, on the Chinese plan that\r\nhad already been tried by Cookworthy.\r\n\r\nChampion was an active politician and a vehement\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PLATE XLIX._ 1--BRISTOL, WHITE BISCUIT 2--BRISTOL,\r\nWHITE GLAZED WARE]\r\n\r\nsupporter of the American colonists in their dispute with the mother\r\ncountry. The visit of Edmund Burke to Bristol in 1774, and his election\r\nas member for the city, may be regarded as the climax of his career.\r\nThen it was that the famous tea-set was presented by Champion and his\r\nwife to Mrs. Burke, as a _pignus amicitiæ_. Still more elaborately\r\ndecorated was the other service that Burke gave to Mrs. Smith, the wife\r\nof the friend of Champion, at whose house he stayed on this occasion.\r\nThe shapes and the decoration of this service were founded on Dresden\r\nmodels, and the wreaths of laurels that formed an essential part of the\r\ndesign afforded a good field for the display of the green colour in\r\nwhich Champion excelled.\r\n\r\nBut Champion’s troubles were now to begin. In 1775 his petition to\r\nParliament for a renewal of his patent was vigorously opposed by\r\nWedgwood. Champion must have been put to great expense--he exhibited\r\nbefore a committee of the House some selected specimens of his\r\nporcelain. He, however, won his case, though the monopoly in the\r\nemployment of the Cornish clays was restricted to their use as a\r\nmaterial for _transparent_ wares, a point of some importance to the\r\nStaffordshire potter. But meantime the American War was ruining his\r\nbusiness--for Champion was in the first place a merchant trading with\r\nthe West Indies and America--and it is probable that little porcelain\r\nwas made by him after 1777. The next year Wedgwood, his inveterate\r\nopponent, in a letter to Bentley, says of him, ‘Poor Champion, you may\r\nhave heard, is quite demolished.... I suppose we might buy some\r\nGrowan-stone and Growan-clay now upon easy terms.’ In 1781, after a long\r\nnegotiation, he disposed of his patent to some Staffordshire potters,\r\nand shortly after this he emigrated to America. Champion was only\r\nforty-eight years old when, in 1791, he died at his new home in South\r\nCarolina.\r\n\r\nAs Professor Church has pointed out, the paste of the Bristol porcelain\r\nis of exceptional hardness. It is, in fact, in some specimens as hard as\r\nquartz, that is, say, the hardness is equal to 7 in the scale of the\r\nmineralogist: the hardness of Oriental porcelain, it will be remembered,\r\nvaries between 6 and 6·5; the glaze on the Bristol china is about 6 on\r\nthe same scale. The fractured surface may be described as subconchoidal\r\nand somewhat flaky, with a greasy to vitreous lustre. On the Plymouth\r\nand Bristol wares, especially on the larger vases, may often be seen,\r\nwhen viewed in a favourable light, certain spiral ridges, the result of\r\nthe unequal pressure of the ‘thrower’s’ hand. Similar ridges may indeed\r\nbe observed at times on other hard paste wares, both Chinese and\r\nEuropean, and this ‘wreathing’ or _vissage_, as Brongniart long ago\r\npointed out, is the result of the _too great plasticity_ of the clay,--a\r\nclay may, in fact, be too ‘fat’ to work well on the wheel. This\r\nplasticity, however, would be of advantage to the modeller, especially\r\nwhen working on a very small scale; indeed the delicate floral reliefs\r\nin biscuit, on the plaques we have already spoken of, could only have\r\nbeen made from a fine and unctuous clay. How refractory to heat this\r\nsame paste is, was well proved by the fire at the Alexandra Palace in\r\n1873, when so many fine specimens of English porcelain were destroyed. A\r\nbiscuit plaque or medallion of Bristol porcelain passed uninjured (by\r\nheat at least) through this fire, while the soft porcelain alongside of\r\nit was completely melted.\r\n\r\nThe paste, then, of this Bristol ware is remarkable both for its\r\nresistance to heat and for its great plasticity. These are both\r\nqualities that point to an excess of kaolin in its composition, and this\r\nexcess is confirmed by analysis. Professor Church found in a specimen of\r\nBristol china 63 per cent. of silica, 33 per cent. of alumina, and only\r\n4 per cent. of lime and alkalis. The percentage of alumina is about the\r\nsame as that in the hard pastes of Meissen and of Sèvres, but the small\r\namount of the other bases is quite exceptional. A paste of this\r\ncomposition would contain about 65 per cent. of kaolin.\r\n\r\nAnd here, before ending, we may for a moment return to what is, perhaps,\r\nthe crucial point of all in the composition of true porcelain--for it is\r\none that has a radical influence both on the technical and on the\r\nartistic side. The first question we must ask when inquiring into the\r\ncomposition of any specimen of porcelain is this--What proportion of\r\nkaolin enters into its composition? Or if it is a matter of the primary\r\nconstituents of the paste--What is the percentage of alumina that it\r\ncontains? Now we may consider the composition of kaolin, after removing\r\nthe water, to be silica 54 per cent. and alumina 46 per cent., and the\r\nnearer the composition of our porcelain approaches to these figures, the\r\ngreater will be its hardness, its resistance to fire, and the greater\r\nalso the plasticity of the paste--the greater in fact will be what we\r\nhave called the ‘severity’ of the type.[255]\r\n\r\nNow for the other component of porcelain, the petuntse or china-stone.\r\nThe composition of this material differs widely, but let us take the\r\nmean of some analyses of Cornish stone. On this basis we may take silica\r\n72 per cent., alumina 18 per cent., other bases 10 per cent., as our\r\ntype. The result of adding such a material to our kaolin will be to\r\nincrease the percentage of silica and of the ‘other bases,’ and to\r\ndiminish the percentage of alumina in the resultant mixture. Our paste\r\nnow becomes less plastic and the resultant porcelain more readily\r\nsoftened by heat, but at the same time less hard.\r\n\r\nSo far every one would be agreed. But the question now arises, are we to\r\nattribute this increased fusibility to the higher percentage of the\r\nother bases (these are, in the case of European porcelain, practically\r\nlime and potash), or in a measure at least to the increased amount of\r\nsilica in the paste? We have here three variants, the silica, the\r\nalumina, and the ‘other bases,’ and the case is therefore somewhat\r\ncomplicated. I think, however, that the careful examination of any table\r\ngiving the composition of various types of porcelain would show that up\r\nto a certain point an increase in the amount of silica promotes a lower\r\nsoftening-point in the paste, and this in cases where there is no\r\nimportant change in the proportion of the ‘other bases.’ I will\r\nillustrate this by comparing the composition of the severe hard paste of\r\nSèvres on the one hand with an analysis of a mild type of Chinese\r\nporcelain on the other:--\r\n\r\n    Sèvres hard paste (1843).    Chinese porcelain.\r\n\r\n  Silica,       58   per cent.    70·5 per cent.\r\n  Alumina,      34·5    ”         21      ”\r\n  Other bases,   7·5    ”          7·5    ”\r\n\r\nNo doubt, if the percentage of silica is further increased, say beyond\r\n78 or 80 per cent., we get again a practically infusible body. But with\r\na paste of this composition the resultant ware is no longer\r\ntranslucent--we pass from the region of porcelain to a true stoneware.\r\n\r\nThus we see that in composition a mild porcelain forms a middle term\r\nbetween stoneware on the one hand, and a severe porcelain on the other.\r\nIn other words, stoneware cannot be regarded as an extreme type of a\r\nrefractory porcelain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nCONTEMPORARY EUROPEAN PORCELAIN\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have seen that in England the new aims and the new schemes of\r\ndecoration that have so profoundly affected most of our industrial arts\r\nhave so far had little influence upon the porcelain manufactured by the\r\nlarge Staffordshire firms. Here and there, as by Mr. Bernard Moore of\r\nLongton, an attempt has been made to take up the problem of the _flambé_\r\nglazes, which has so fascinated the French potters. Mr. Moore has\r\nsucceeded in making some _sang de bœuf_ vases which in outline and\r\ncolour closely follow the Chinese models. Otherwise the many skilful\r\nartists--more than one of them, I think, are Frenchmen--employed by our\r\nporcelain manufacturers have been content to follow in the main the old\r\ntraditions, nor has any occasional attempt that has been made to\r\nimitate, not the latest but rather the work of the last generation at\r\nSèvres, produced any very satisfactory results. It cannot be denied that\r\nboth in the design and in the decoration our English porcelain has, for\r\nsome time, remained outside the art movement of the day.\r\n\r\nIndeed at the present time, and for the last twenty years, whatever of\r\ninterest we can find in the contemporary production of porcelain,\r\ncentres in two factories--Sèvres and Copenhagen. To the latter works we\r\nmust now return for a moment.\r\n\r\nThe royal factory, of which we have already spoken, was closed after the\r\ndisastrous war of 1864. But during the eighties a number of able men,\r\nboth artists and men of science, occupied themselves with the new\r\nporcelain problems, and in 1888 a fresh company was formed, the\r\n‘Alumina.’ These men--I will only mention Philip Schou--were much\r\nimpressed by the technical and artistic merits of the porcelain lately\r\nsent from Japan, highly finished ware decorated under the glaze with\r\ngreat delicacy and generally in subdued colours. They were influenced\r\nabove all by the work of the Japanese potter Miyagawa Kozan, called\r\nMakudzo. The Danish porcelain produced during the nineties is\r\ndistinguished as a whole by its cool, subdued colours, with a prevalence\r\nof various pearly tints approaching more or less to celadon. In the\r\ncarefully executed but boldly designed decoration, we see the influence\r\nboth of the Japanese naturalists and of the impressionist painters of\r\nthe day. The snow scenes, the rocks, the dancing waves and the sea birds\r\nhave been suggested by the stormy coasts of the Baltic and the North\r\nSea. It is from the primitive rocks of this coast that the pure felspar,\r\nwhich plays so large a part both in the paste and in the glaze, has been\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\nIt was at Copenhagen probably that the crystalline glazes, derived from\r\nsalts of bismuth, were first made--this was by Engelhart, about 1884.\r\n\r\nAt a rival Danish factory--that of Bing and Gröndhal--many clever\r\nartists, some of them ladies, have modelled in porcelain figures of\r\nanimals either in the round or in relief on the sides of vases: we find\r\ndogs, cats, and even seals (but not the human figure). Indeed in this\r\nkind of work something in the nature of a school has grown up.\r\n\r\nFresh life has lately been given to the old works at Rörstrand, near\r\nStockholm. Here in the underglaze decoration the same cool, pearly\r\ncolours that we find in favour at Copenhagen are predominant. Great\r\ncare has lately been devoted to the modelling of flowers.\r\n\r\nAt the Rozenburg works, near the Hague, a new paste has been invented by\r\nJuriann Kok. The extraordinary tenacity and plasticity of this material\r\nallows of its being worked into the strangest forms--some of the vases,\r\nwith long, thin, angular handles, suggest work in hammered metal. By\r\nmeans of a fantastic decoration--quaint, elongated figures, and forms of\r\nmarine life, such as the long-clawed Japanese lobster--a certain\r\noriginal _cachet_ has been given to this ware.\r\n\r\nThe Charlottenburg works, near Berlin, have lately felt the influence\r\nboth of Copenhagen and of the new school of Sèvres. Everything has been\r\nlately tried--sculpturesque developments in various directions, and\r\nagain the decoration of large wall surfaces with porcelain plaques\r\nenamelled so as to resemble oil pictures; but as in former days, so now,\r\nthe technical and scientific side of this industry tends to prevail over\r\nthe artistic.\r\n\r\nM. Édouard Garnier, the late director of the Museum at Sèvres, in a\r\nreport upon the porcelain exhibited at Paris in 1900, has ably summed up\r\nhis impressions of the wares now being manufactured in various parts of\r\nEurope, and I cannot do better than follow so excellent an authority in\r\nhis ‘appreciations’ of this modern porcelain.\r\n\r\nM. Garnier dates the latest renaissance of European porcelain from the\r\nnew ground struck out in the seventies, not only at Sèvres, by Deck and\r\nothers, but also in many private kilns, as by Bracquemont in Paris and\r\nby Haviland in the Limoges district. What specially distinguishes the\r\nlatest work is the advantage taken of the new colours that can now be\r\nemployed with the _grand feu_ so as to participate in the brilliancy and\r\npurity of the glaze. A delicacy of tone, a transparency and a harmony\r\nare now obtainable which contrasts favourably with the dry and dull\r\ncolours of the old methods of painting. On the other hand, says M.\r\nGarnier, the progress in chemical knowledge has been so rapid that the\r\nnew processes and colours have tended to become the masters of the\r\nartists who employ them, instead of remaining subtle tools in their\r\nhands.\r\n\r\nThis tendency is especially noticeable at Copenhagen, and the\r\ncrystalline glazes, derived from bismuth, that have spread thence all\r\nover Europe, are a case in point. So again, starting from the _flambé_\r\nglaze of the Chinese, the modern potter is inclined to run riot with the\r\nnumerous new materials at his command.\r\n\r\nAt Sèvres--I follow M. Garnier’s report--advantage has been taken of the\r\nnew porcelain paste (that of the ‘milder’ Chinese type) to revive in the\r\nbiscuit ware the reproductions of works of sculpture for which the\r\nfactory was so renowned in the days of the _pâte tendre_. The pureness\r\nand softness of the material and the skill of the manipulation are\r\nnoteworthy apart from the artistic merit of the work. (Let me here call\r\nattention to the fifteen figures by Léonard, ‘_Le Jeu de l’Écharpe_,’ in\r\nthe new biscuit ware.) This revolution in the style of decoration has\r\nnow spread to other parts of France, and has affected the great\r\ncommercial factories of the south-west, especially the ware made by the\r\nfirm of Haviland.\r\n\r\nEnglish porcelain was but poorly represented at Paris in 1900; besides,\r\nas we have said, it is in other branches of the potter’s art that we\r\nhave to look for a reflection of our new native school of decoration. It\r\nis indeed a curious fact that many of the designs that we associate with\r\nMorris and his followers may be found rather upon the wares of\r\nCopenhagen and Sèvres than on our English porcelain. I cannot, however,\r\npass over some criticisms of M. Garnier, in which he falls foul of\r\ncertain tendencies in the fashioning and decoration of the wares turned\r\nout by our big Staffordshire firms. As to how far these criticisms are\r\nmerited, any one may form an opinion for himself by a glance at the\r\nshop-windows of London. ‘The English paste,’ says M. Garnier, ‘is of a\r\nspecial nature which lends itself admirably both to the shaping and to\r\nthe decoration; the execution is _hors ligne_, but this is accompanied\r\nby an overloading of detail, a heaviness in the decoration, and a want\r\nof harmony and proportion between the different parts of the piece that\r\ncause one to regret that so much talent and care have been employed only\r\nto arrive at so very unsatisfactory a result. Besides this, we notice in\r\nthe English _céramiste_ a want of sincerity, with the result that at\r\nfirst sight you cannot tell what manner of substance you are looking at,\r\nwhether it is porcelain or dirty ivory, or again a gilt ceramic ware\r\nrather than a bronze with a poor patina.’ A curious point in connection\r\nwith this criticism is that, if I am not mistaken, a good deal of the\r\nwork thus severely dealt with has been designed, if not executed, by\r\nFrench artists. It is made, however, to satisfy the demand of our great\r\nunleavened middle-class.\r\n\r\nTurning to the porcelain from the royal works at Charlottenburg, M.\r\nGarnier finds fault with the exuberance and overloading of the\r\nsculptures and reliefs. But certain large architectural pieces and some\r\nframes in rococo style, in pure white ware, excite his admiration, for\r\nthe beauty of the paste, the purity and the limpidity of the glaze, and\r\nthe marvellous way in which the technical difficulties of the execution\r\nhave been surmounted; so, too, for the brilliancy of the colouring and\r\nthe way in which the enamel colours combine with and form one material\r\nwith the glaze, as if one were looking at a soft-paste ware. Above all,\r\nin some pieces of the ‘new porcelain’--for the milder paste is now in\r\nuse at Berlin to some extent--the colours of the _grand feu_ and the\r\npurity of the enamel are remarkable.\r\n\r\nAt Meissen, says M. Garnier, they are still working on the old lines:\r\nreproductions of the models made a century and a half ago by Kändler are\r\nas much as ever in demand. Certain ambitious attempts in a newer style\r\nhave resulted in errors that will add nothing to the fame of the works.\r\n(Dr. Heintze, the present director, has especially devoted himself to\r\nthe development of the new colours under the glaze. But the porcelain\r\nnow produced, apart from the copies of the old wares, follows in the\r\nlines either of the Copenhagen porcelain, or again, at times, of the\r\ncoloured pastes of Sèvres.)\r\n\r\nCertain districts of Northern Bohemia have become of late centres of\r\nceramic industry. The predominant bad taste and over-decoration of the\r\nporcelain made there (I still follow M. Garnier) is above all\r\nexemplified in certain coloured statuettes, ‘_articles de bazar_ which\r\ncorrupt the taste of the public and whose sale ought to be prohibited.’\r\nAn exception must be made for the produce of the Pirkenhausen works,\r\nnear Carlsbad. The marvellous plasticity of the paste, made from the\r\nrich deposits of kaolin near Zottlitz, has been taken full advantage of,\r\nnot only on the wheel and in the mould; it has allowed also of the free\r\nmodelling of the superadded reliefs by the artist’s hand.\r\n\r\nThe factory at Herend, in Hungary, founded in 1839, no longer turns out\r\nthe ware of Oriental style, so much admired by Brongniart, by Humboldt,\r\nand by Thiers. Herr Fischer, the director and principal artist, has\r\nlately made good imitations of the coloured pastes of Sèvres, with\r\nleaves and branches in relief.\r\n\r\nAt St. Petersburg the imitation of the over-decorated hard paste of\r\nSèvres has been abandoned in favour of the soft and harmonious colours\r\nand the pure and limpid glazes of Copenhagen. The vases with designs of\r\nwhite paste, in relief upon coloured grounds, in a manner now little in\r\nfavour at Sèvres, are less happy. At the Kousnetzoff factory, at Moscow,\r\na polychrome decoration, in imitation of Byzantine embroideries and\r\nenamels, has been applied to tea-services of somewhat geometrical forms,\r\nwhile the French porcelain of the time of Louis Philippe continues to be\r\nimitated.\r\n\r\nAt Copenhagen, says M. Garnier, the new porcelain, which since its\r\nintroduction in 1889 has been praised and exalted in all the art\r\njournals of Europe, is still produced on the same lines. Not to speak of\r\nthe new and strange results already obtained from coloured and enamelled\r\nglazes, greater experience in the use of the extended palette at the\r\ncommand of the decorator has produced results in which we find an\r\nadmirable delicacy and restraint. It was, however, from Sèvres that the\r\nimpulse first came. We can trace it in the work turned out of late years\r\nby Messrs. Bing and Gröndhal. But in place of the amiable and gracious\r\nart of France we find here a severe, sometimes we might almost say a\r\nrude, style, but one not without character and elevation.\r\n\r\nAt Rörstrand, near Stockholm (see above, p. 388), the work still\r\ncontinues on the lines of the older porcelain of Copenhagen (_i.e._ in\r\nthe style in favour ten or twelve years ago), with the same simplicity\r\nand charm in the decoration and delicacy in the modelled relief. Perhaps\r\nwe may attribute to a special quality in the felspar of the north the\r\npure and refined quality so noticeable in the pastes and glazes.\r\n\r\nAt Rozenburg, continues M. Garnier, a factory already well known for its\r\nfayence, a very original kind of porcelain has lately been made. The\r\ncomposition of the paste, though based on kaolin, presents some\r\npeculiarities. The ware is of an incredible thinness and lightness, and\r\nthe strange decoration, based in part upon Japanese motives, is not\r\nwithout charm and originality. The shapes of the vases, however, go too\r\nfar in the direction of eccentricity. (Cf. p. 389.)\r\n\r\nAs at Meissen, so in the porcelain now made in Italy there is a total\r\nabsence of all personality and novelty, and the old, well-beaten road is\r\nstill followed. At Florence this is carried so far that the old moulds\r\nacquired so many years ago from the Capo di Monte works are still in\r\nuse. ‘Ce sont des choses,’ says M. Garnier, ‘qui prêtent trop au\r\n“truquage” et qu’il faut laisser aux fabricants de vieuxneuf.’\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPLANATION OF THE MARKS ON THE FOLLOWING PLATES (A.

CONSTABLE, Printers to His Majesty at the Edinburgh\r\nUniversity Press\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n [1] Some English porcelain is stated by Professor Church to have a\r\n hardness equal to that of quartz. See below, ‘Bristol Porcelain.’\r\n\r\n [2] We have thought it well, once for all, to treat briefly of the\r\n scientific aspect of our subject, but those who are not interested in\r\n this point of view may pass over the next few pages.\r\n\r\n [3] I shall return to this point in a later chapter. I lay the more\r\n stress on this fact, as it is often stated that the hard and slightly\r\n translucent stonewares, such as the Fulham ware of Dwight, which\r\n contains as much as eighty per cent. of silica, form one degree of a\r\n series of which true porcelain is the next term. The fact is, those\r\n who sought to make porcelain by a refinement in the manufacture of\r\n stoneware were as much astray as those who started from a fusible\r\n glass frit.\r\n\r\n [4] The china-stone of Cornwall might, in part at least, be claimed\r\n as an old volcanic rock, and that used in the Imari district of Japan\r\n is distinctly of volcanic origin. Both these rocks, however, consist\r\n essentially of a mixture of quartz and felspar.\r\n\r\n [5] For further details consult the authorities quoted in the\r\n _Handbook_ of the Jermyn Street Collection, p. 5; for sections showing\r\n the relation of the beds of kaolin to the surrounding rock, see\r\n Brongniart’s _Traité des Arts Céramiques_, vol. i.\r\n\r\n [6] It is to the scattered notices and essays of Mr. William Burton\r\n that we must go for information in this country. In his new work on\r\n _English Porcelain_ he does not treat upon this side of the subject.\r\n\r\n [7] The most complete work on the processes of manufacture is now\r\n Dubreuil’s _La Porcelaine_, Paris, 1885. It forms part forty-two in\r\n Fremy’s _Encyclopédie Chimique_. This volume brings up to date and\r\n replaces in some measure the great work of Alexandre Brongniart, the\r\n _Traité des Arts Céramiques_ (two volumes, with a quarto volume of\r\n plates), Paris, 1844. M. Georges Vogt in _La Porcelaine_, Paris, 1893,\r\n gives valuable details of the processes employed at Sèvres.\r\n\r\n [8] The _cailloux_ of the French. This material is often described as\r\n felspar, but I think that quartz can seldom be completely absent.\r\n\r\n [9] I should, however, be inclined to class not only much of the\r\n porcelain of Japan, but some of that made in Germany and in south-west\r\n France, rather in the ‘severe’ kaolinic than in the intermediary class\r\n of M. Vogt.\r\n\r\n [10] We can, however, distinguish, in the tomb paintings of the Middle\r\n Empire, an earlier form without the lower table. This earlier type,\r\n moved by hand from the upper table, was that used by the Greeks at\r\n least as late as the sixth century B.C., and a similar\r\n primitive wheel is still used in India. On later Egyptian monuments of\r\n Ptolemaic time, the potter is seen moving the wheel by pressing his\r\n foot on a second lower table, as now at Sèvres and elsewhere. Both\r\n forms of wheel appear to have been used by the Italian potters of the\r\n Renaissance.\r\n\r\n [11] This seam is often visible on vases of old Chinese porcelain, and\r\n may be taken as a sign that the object has been moulded.\r\n\r\n [12] Porcelain in China followed, as we shall see, in the wake of the\r\n more early developed arts of the bronze-caster and the jade-carver.\r\n Hence the prevalence in the early wares of shapes unsuitable to the\r\n wheel.\r\n\r\n [13] I think that this is a more practical division than the one made\r\n by M. Vogt and adopted by Dr. Bushell.\r\n\r\n [14] An important exception is to be noted in the case of the firing\r\n of large vases in China.\r\n\r\n [15] A good instance of the first case is the finding of crow-claws in\r\n the rubbish-heaps of Fostât or Old Cairo. As to the method of support\r\n indicating the place of origin, see what is said below about the\r\n celadon ware of Siam.\r\n\r\n [16] There is only one exception of any importance--the porcelain of\r\n Chantilly, much of which has an opaque stanniferous glaze.\r\n\r\n [17] So we can infer from the magnificent wall decoration of the\r\n Achæmenian period brought home from Susa by M. Dieulafoi.\r\n\r\n [18] A glaze of this nature was in the Saracenic East applied to a\r\n layer of fine white slip, which itself formed a coating on the coarse\r\n paste. Such a combination, often very difficult to distinguish from a\r\n tin enamel, we find on the wall-tiles of Persia and Damascus.\r\n\r\n [19] Metallic gold has, of course, been applied to the decoration of\r\n porcelain in all countries.\r\n\r\n [20] The colour of the ruby glass in our thirteenth century windows\r\n has a very similar origin. In this case the art was lost and only in\r\n a measure recovered at a later period. As in the case of the Chinese\r\n glaze, the point was to seize the moment when the copper was first\r\n reduced and, in a minute state of division, was suspended in floccular\r\n masses in the glass.\r\n\r\n [21] With these colours a dark blue is sometimes associated. Is this\r\n derived like the turquoise from copper? It is a curious fact that we\r\n have here exactly the same range of colours that we find in the little\r\n glass bottles of Phœnician or Egyptian origin, with zig-zag patterns\r\n (1500-400 B.C.).\r\n\r\n [22] See Vogt, _La Porcelaine_, p. 219. The problem is really more\r\n complicated. For simplicity’s sake we have ignored the changes that\r\n take place in the glaze that lies between the enamels and the paste.\r\n\r\n [23] The same result may be obtained by painting one colour over the\r\n other, as we find in the black ground of the _famille verte_.\r\n\r\n [24] In Persia, where for three centuries at least the Chinese wares\r\n have been known and imitated, the word _chini_ has almost the same\r\n connotation. See below for a discussion of the route by which this\r\n word reached England.\r\n\r\n [25] During the eighteenth century, however, the French missionaries\r\n remained in friendly relation with the Chinese court, especially with\r\n the Emperor Kien-lung, a man of culture and a poet. The Père Amiot\r\n sent home not only letters with valuable information, but from time to\r\n time presents of porcelain from the emperor. He was in correspondence\r\n with the minister Bertin, who was himself a keen collector of\r\n porcelain. See the notes in the Catalogue of Bertin’s sale, Paris,\r\n 1815.\r\n\r\n [26] Thanks to the industry of the present curator, Herr Zimmermann,\r\n the same may now be said of the great collection at Dresden.\r\n\r\n [27] For a discussion, and for many illustrations of the art of these\r\n early dynasties which survives chiefly in objects of jade or bronze,\r\n see Paléologue, _Art Chinois_, Paris, 1887.\r\n\r\n [28] The wild statements as to the transparency, above all, of the\r\n Sung and even the Tang porcelain may, however, appear to receive some\r\n confirmation from the reports of the old Arab travellers. But how\r\n much credence we can give to these authorities may be gleaned from\r\n a description of the fayence of Egypt, by a Persian traveller of\r\n the eleventh century. ‘This ware of Misr,’ he says, ‘is so fine and\r\n diaphanous that the hand may be seen through it when it is applied to\r\n the side of the vessel.’ He is speaking not of porcelain, but of a\r\n silicious glazed earthenware!\r\n\r\n [29] _Pekin Oriental Society_, 1886; see also Bushell’s _Ceramic Art_,\r\n p. 132 seq.\r\n\r\n [30] See the passage in his _History_ (chapter ix.) where this stern\r\n censor, referring to the passion for collecting china, rebukes the\r\n ‘frivolous and inelegant fashion’ for ‘these grotesque baubles.’\r\n\r\n [31] The name Céladon first occurs in the _Astrée_, the once famous\r\n novel of Honoré D’Urfé. When later in the seventeenth century Céladon,\r\n the courtier-shepherd, was introduced on the stage, he appeared in a\r\n costume of greyish green, which became the fashionable colour of the\r\n time, and his name was transferred to the Chinese porcelain with a\r\n glaze of very similar colour, which was first introduced into France\r\n about that period.\r\n\r\n [32] Julien translated the word _ching_ as blue, an unfortunate\r\n rendering in this case, which has been the cause of much confusion.\r\n He was so far justified in this, in that the same word is used by the\r\n Chinese for the cobalt blue of our ‘blue and white,’ while it was not\r\n applied by them to a pronounced green tint.\r\n\r\n [33] I shall return to this point when treating of English porcelain.\r\n\r\n [34] Somewhat later the Chinese were for a time neighbours of the\r\n Sassanian empire, where the arts of glazing pottery and making glass\r\n were highly developed. Sassanian bronzes, and probably textiles, have\r\n found their way to Japan.\r\n\r\n [35] The salt-glazed ware of Europe seems to be the only important\r\n exception to this perhaps rather sweeping generalisation.\r\n\r\n [36] It is possible, however, that some of the various tints of brown\r\n used from early Ming times, especially that known to the Chinese as\r\n ‘old gold,’ may have been suggested by this copper lustre. The ground\r\n on which this lustre is superimposed in some old Persian wares is of\r\n a very similar shade. Dr. Bushell mentions a tradition that the old\r\n potters tried to produce a yellow colour by adding metallic gold to\r\n their glaze, but that the gold all disappeared in the heat of the\r\n _grand feu_. They had therefore to fall back upon the _or bruni_.\r\n\r\n [37] Consult for this ware the beautifully illustrated monographs of\r\n Mr. Henry Wallis on early Persian ceramics.\r\n\r\n [38] The cobalt pigment itself, when not of native origin, was known\r\n to the Chinese in Ming times as _Hui-hui ch’ing_ or ‘Mohammedan blue.’\r\n The other names for the material, _sunipo_ and _sumali_, probably\r\n point in the same direction.\r\n\r\n [39] A little white oval vase, in the Treasury of St. Mark’s, at\r\n Venice, may possibly be of this old Ting ware. The decoration is in\r\n low relief, and four little rings for suspension surround the mouth.\r\n In any case this is the only piece in this famous collection that has\r\n any claim to be classed as porcelain.\r\n\r\n [40] The style of this _cloisonné_ decoration is almost identical\r\n with that seen in the two magnificent lacquer screens with landscapes\r\n and Buddhist emblems at South Kensington. The chains of pearls and\r\n _pendeloques_ are characteristic of a style of painting often found on\r\n the beams and ceilings of the old Buddhist temples of Japan. This is,\r\n I think, a _motif_ not found elsewhere on Chinese porcelain.\r\n\r\n [41] The late M. Du Sartel gives in his work on Chinese porcelain good\r\n photographs of some jars of this class in his collection. He was one\r\n of the first to call attention to this ware.\r\n\r\n [42] This dull surface is especially noticeable in some of the\r\n specimens with Arabic inscriptions in the British Museum; these date\r\n from the Cheng-te period (1505-21).\r\n\r\n [43] In Persia, too, and in that country accompanied by many other\r\n varieties of Chinese porcelain. For examples of these wares see above\r\n all the collection at South Kensington.\r\n\r\n [44] _Relations des Musulmans avec les Chinois._ It is not impossible,\r\n however, that further research may bring to light some information on\r\n this subject. Since writing this I hear from Dr. Bushell that some\r\n specimens of Saracenic enamelled glass, presumably of the fourteenth\r\n century, have lately been purchased in Pekin. The Arab trade with\r\n China was probably never more active than in the first half of the\r\n fifteenth century. It is with the Memlook Sultans, then ruling a wide\r\n empire from Cairo, that we must associate most of this enamelled\r\n glass, and the Eastern trade was in their hands.\r\n\r\n [45] See Bushell, p. 454.\r\n\r\n [46] Note that cobalt as an enamel colour was not applied on porcelain\r\n during Ming times.\r\n\r\n [47] There is, however, a curious old bowl in the Salting collection\r\n with the nien-hao of Cheng-te (1505-21), on which a design of iron\r\n red, two shades of green, a brownish purple, _and a cobalt blue of\r\n poor lavender tint, all these colours over the glaze_, is combined\r\n with an _underglaze_ decoration of fish, in a full _copper red_. Note\r\n also the early use of a cobalt blue enamel, _sur couverte_, in the\r\n Kakiyemon ware of Japan.\r\n\r\n [48] Much of this kind was translated by Julien, and a good summary\r\n may be found in Hippisley’s paper contributed to the Smithsonian\r\n Institute, but the information from the same and other sources is\r\n more accurately translated and critically analysed in the seventh and\r\n eighth chapters of Dr. Bushell’s great work.\r\n\r\n [49] Yung-lo, according to the Chinese reckoning, did not commence his\r\n reign until the new year’s day following the death of his predecessor\r\n (1403). I have, however, thought it better to adopt the European\r\n method of reckoning dates.\r\n\r\n [50] The name _Sentoku_ that they give to it is the Japanese reading\r\n of the characters forming this emperor’s name.\r\n\r\n [51] We may mention that a pair of wide-mouthed vases of this ware,\r\n shown at the Burlington Fine Arts Club in 1896, bore the nien-hao of\r\n Kia-tsing (1521-66) inscribed round the mouth.\r\n\r\n [52] More properly a _fresh name was given to the period_, but for the\r\n sake of brevity we here as elsewhere identify the emperor’s name with\r\n that given to the nien-hao.\r\n\r\n [53] The Trenchard bowls, mentioned below, belong probably to this or\r\n to the following reign.\r\n\r\n [54] But this name is also applied by some to the older Su-ma-li blue.\r\n\r\n [55] Perhaps the earliest nien-hao on a piece of blue and white in\r\n which we can place any confidence.\r\n\r\n [56] A predecessor of his as viceroy and superintendent at\r\n King-te-chen was _Lang Ting-tso_, from whom the famous Lang yao, the\r\n _sang de bœuf_, had its name, though this derivation is not absolutely\r\n certain. It could only have been quite in the last days of the latter\r\n viceroy’s rule that much good work was turned out from the kilns.\r\n\r\n [57] It will be observed that the turquoise blue and the green, both\r\n derived from copper, so happily combined in the wall-tiles of the\r\n Saracenic East, are in China rarely found united in the decoration of\r\n the same piece, and this arises from practical difficulties connected\r\n with the fluxes and the firing. At least the two colours are never\r\n _successfully_ combined, for the attempt was apparently made in Ming\r\n times, and of this some instances are given in the following note.\r\n Indeed I should be inclined to regard such a combination on any piece\r\n as an evidence of early, probably of Ming, origin.\r\n\r\n [58] I would especially point to a remarkable water-vessel, about ten\r\n inches high, in the collection at Dresden. This vase is in the form\r\n of a phœnix. _Green_, as well as _turquoise_, purple and yellow are\r\n all found in the decoration, and the colours are all well developed.\r\n There is in the British Museum--a collection in many ways remarkable\r\n for the number of exceptional types illustrated--a jar with cover, of\r\n this class. The ground is a dull purple covered with small spirals\r\n of black; the rest of the decoration--rocks, waves, flowers, and\r\n jewels--is mainly green of two shades with a little yellow. On some of\r\n the flowers, however, we see a poor attempt at turquoise blue. Next\r\n to this example stands a baluster-shaped vase with tall, straight\r\n neck (PL. VII. 2.). The ground is here of a pale greyish yellow, with\r\n crackles of a darker shade--so far, in fact, of a Ko yao type. The\r\n decoration is of a predominant leafy green, with a little purple and\r\n yellow here and there; but on the flowers we find, in addition, an\r\n enamel of turquoise, poor in colour, indeed, but certainly a copper\r\n blue. Both these examples are classed as Ming, and both would seem\r\n to show that the combination of the turquoise enamel (essentially\r\n a silicate of copper and soda) with the lead-fluxed green had been\r\n attempted in Ming times. It was, however, impossible to obtain\r\n satisfactory results in this way, so that in Kang-he’s time the\r\n turquoise was reserved for the _demi grand feu_, and the green alone\r\n used as an enamel over the glaze.\r\n\r\n [59] ‘Muffle-colours,’ of course in these later examples painted over\r\n the glaze, and therefore to be classed as enamels.\r\n\r\n [60] In this respect we may compare such decoration to a dark\r\n water-colour drawing on white paper, where advantage is only taken of\r\n the white ground for scattered lights here and there.\r\n\r\n [61] We must always think of this great man in connection with his\r\n contemporary in France, Louis XIV. Omitting the early years of the\r\n French king, before he attained his majority, the two long reigns run\r\n almost exactly together.\r\n\r\n [62] This list is to be found in Julien’s book. Dr. Bushell has since\r\n given a more accurate translation, accompanied by a careful analysis\r\n (_Chinese Ceramics_, chapter xii.).\r\n\r\n [63] The red paste of early times was, however, imitated, and a\r\n ‘copper paste’ is also mentioned in connection with these old wares.\r\n The last expression is obscure, but it has certainly nothing to do\r\n with an enamel on copper.\r\n\r\n [64] On the other hand, on some large showy vases of this time we can\r\n trace a series of rings, giving an uneven surface. These are caused\r\n either by the undue pressure of the potter’s fingers (_vissage_), or\r\n perhaps in part by the way in which the successive stages of the jar\r\n were built up with ‘sausage-shaped’ rolls of clay.\r\n\r\n [65] How this iron red was manipulated, apparently at a transition\r\n period, so as to obtain an effect approaching that of the _rouge\r\n d’or_, is described on page 162.\r\n\r\n [66] A ruby-red can be obtained by careful manipulation from gold\r\n alone. We may regard the addition of tin as a convenient method of\r\n developing the colour which was apparently known to the mediæval\r\n alchemists.\r\n\r\n [67] It would be a point of special interest to determine the date\r\n when these two colours--the pink (used as a ground) and the opaque\r\n turquoise blue--were first used in China. Their presence together\r\n with the lemon-yellow gives perhaps the first note of a period of\r\n decline. There is in the British Museum a bowl and saucer covered\r\n on the outside with this rose enamel and bearing this unusual\r\n inscription--‘the _Sin-chou_ year occurring again.’ This expression\r\n was referred by Franks to the sixty-first year of the reign of\r\n Kang-he, when the cyclical year in which his reign began recurred\r\n again, an unprecedented fact in Chinese history. In the same\r\n collection is a saucer-shaped plate with a pale pink ground with\r\n the mark of the period Yung-cheng. But the evidence in favour of a\r\n somewhat later date for the fully developed use of the _rouge d’or_\r\n seems to me fairly strong. Dr. Bushell, however, tells me that he has\r\n seen other examples where the same inscription is found upon ware\r\n decorated with the _rouge d’or_, and that he accepts the early date\r\n (1722) on the Sin-chou plate. I return to this question on page 136.\r\n\r\n [68] Julien omitted this curious passage in his translation as devoid\r\n of interest!\r\n\r\n [69] There are two magnificent vases of the black lacquered ware, each\r\n about eight feet high, in the Musée Guimet, and of the brown variety a\r\n well-preserved spherical bowl may be seen at South Kensington.\r\n\r\n [70] The snuff-bottles of the Chinese represent the _inro_ of the\r\n Japanese. Both were originally used for pills and for eye medicine.\r\n\r\n [71] Dr. Bushell tells us that she is an accomplished artist and\r\n calligraphist, and that her autograph signature is much valued. She is\r\n said to have sent down from the palace, to be copied at King-te-chen,\r\n bowls and dishes of the time of Kien-lung, just as that emperor in his\r\n day forwarded from Pekin examples of Sung and Ming wares with the same\r\n object. So the old tradition is kept up!\r\n\r\n [72] These references are to the plates of marks at the end of the\r\n book.\r\n\r\n [73] See, however, p. 110 note, for a curious instance of its use.\r\n\r\n [74] A good example of a date-mark of Wan-li in this position may be\r\n seen on the vase reproduced on PL. VII. Fig. 2.\r\n\r\n [75] Why, by the way, do we find, in catalogues otherwise well edited,\r\n porcelain ascribed to the Kang-he _dynasty_? One might as well speak\r\n of the Louis XIV. dynasty.\r\n\r\n [76] At least such was the case when the Canal was in working order.\r\n For some time since, the Grand Canal has only been navigable _when the\r\n country is flooded_.\r\n\r\n [77] I cannot find the exact date of the first publication of these\r\n letters. In the eighteenth century we find them generally quoted from\r\n Du Halde.\r\n\r\n [78] This is a passage made use of by Longfellow in those often-quoted\r\n lines beginning--\r\n\r\n    ‘A burning town, or seeming so,\r\n     Three thousand furnaces that glow,’ etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n [79] If we are to understand by this ‘transparent pebble’ some form of\r\n arsenic, for it would seem that arsenic (and not tin as with us) is\r\n the base of the opaque white enamels of the Chinese, it is difficult\r\n to believe that so volatile a substance could be thus prepared.\r\n\r\n [80] For the use of steatite in English porcelain see chap. xxii. At\r\n Vinovo, in Piedmont, another magnesian mineral has been employed for\r\n the paste.\r\n\r\n [81] In the following summary I have kept to the Père D’Entrecolles’s\r\n words as far as possible, but with considerable abbreviations.\r\n\r\n [82] We must here think of the more sober _famille verte_ lantern at\r\n South Kensington, rather than of the magnificent specimen of pierced\r\n work in the Salting collection, which is of later date.\r\n\r\n [83] The unique bowl of Chinese porcelain illustrated in Du Sartel’s\r\n book, of which the outside is decorated in black and gold in imitation\r\n of the Limoges enamel of the renaissance, may have had some such\r\n origin. This piece, on which even the initials of the original French\r\n artist have been copied, was formerly in the Marquis collection, and\r\n is now to be seen in the Grandidier Gallery at the Louvre.\r\n\r\n [84] We have already alluded to this point, _à propos_ of a bowl in\r\n the British Museum; see p. 110 note.\r\n\r\n [85] This branch of the subject is fully worked out in chapter xvii.\r\n of Dr. Bushell’s work.\r\n\r\n [86] When compared with a similar collection of European wares,\r\n perhaps the most noticeable difference is the small number of vessels\r\n adapted to _pouring_. So much is this the case that when we find a\r\n spout or lip on a specimen of Chinese porcelain, the piece takes\r\n at once a somewhat exotic aspect, and we are reminded of the Arab\r\n _Ibraik_, or the European ewer.\r\n\r\n [87] It is a curious fact that London chemists now send out their\r\n pills in little glass bottles almost identical in shape and size with\r\n these Chinese yao-ping.\r\n\r\n [88] The word is used in a restricted sense as explained above.\r\n\r\n [89] We have far too often to fall back on names of French origin. Our\r\n colour-vocabulary in the case of the enamels and glazes of porcelain\r\n is a sadly poor one.\r\n\r\n [90] In the case of some monochrome ware the colour may have been\r\n painted on the raw paste or on the biscuit, and a colourless glaze\r\n then added; or again, as in the case of the coral red mentioned below,\r\n it may be painted like an enamel _over_ the glaze.\r\n\r\n [91] It must, however, be remembered that this carved lacquer itself\r\n is sometimes applied as a coating to porcelain in China.\r\n\r\n [92] It would be convenient to have a name to include the whole\r\n series--the _flambé_, the _sang de bœuf_, the lavender Yuan, and\r\n perhaps also the peach-bloom and the ‘robin’s egg.’ I would propose to\r\n include _all these classes_ under the head of _transmutation glazes_.\r\n\r\n [93] A French writer compares the effect to the ‘palette d’un\r\n coloriste montrée sous un morceau de glace’ (E. de Goncourt, _La\r\n Maison d’un Artiste_).\r\n\r\n [94] There were many kinds of ‘furnace transmutations’ known to the\r\n Chinese, mostly of a miraculous nature (see Bushell, p. 219).\r\n\r\n [95] When applied to _the whole surface_, a similar slip forms the\r\n ground on which the decoration is painted in the case of many kinds of\r\n European and Saracenic fayence, but in such ware the slip is used to\r\n conceal a more or less coarse and coloured paste.\r\n\r\n [96] It may, however, be noticed, on close examination, that the\r\n crackles do not seem to be developed in the lower glaze covered by the\r\n slip. This would rather point to both the first and the second coats\r\n of glaze, as well as the intermediate slip, being all applied before\r\n the firing.\r\n\r\n [97] Not that we need claim any great age for these plates, but it is\r\n in such places that old types (as _e.g._ the celadon) are likely to\r\n continue in fashion.\r\n\r\n [98] We may perhaps connect the first steady export of ‘blue and\r\n white’ direct to Europe with the establishment of the Dutch at\r\n Nagasaki, where they probably employed Chinese workmen.\r\n\r\n [99] So what is by far the most successful imitation of Chinese ‘blue\r\n and white’ ever produced in Europe was made by the Dutch, in the\r\n enamelled fayence of Delft, about the middle of the century.\r\n\r\n [100] In Japanese art also we find the prunus as a symbol of the\r\n approaching spring, but there the branches are covered with freshly\r\n fallen snow. The contrast of the weather in early spring, in China and\r\n Japan respectively, could not be better expressed--by ice in the one\r\n case, by soft thawing snow in the other.\r\n\r\n [101] Dr. Zimmermann, the curator of the Dresden Museum, regards the\r\n black division of the _famille verte_ as a product of the _demi grand\r\n feu_, _i.e._ he holds that the black and green was painted on the\r\n biscuit. But this is certainly not the case with the fully developed\r\n examples. I may say that this class is only represented at Dresden by\r\n some small roughly painted plates.\r\n\r\n [102] We find it so used, however, upon the Japanese ‘Kakiyemon’\r\n porcelain, some of which cannot be much later than the middle of the\r\n seventeenth century.\r\n\r\n [103] Since writing this I have discovered a tall-necked bottle of\r\n this ware at South Kensington, which is stated to have been purchased\r\n in Persia (PL. XX.).\r\n\r\n [104] That is to say, no attempt was ever made to imitate the\r\n material--the hard paste.\r\n\r\n [105] An important collection of armorial china was bequeathed to the\r\n Museum in 1887 by the Rev. Charles Walker.\r\n\r\n [106] This plate belongs to a group in which the arms, above all the\r\n mantlings, are in the style of the seventeenth century. On these the\r\n _gules_ is always rendered by an opaque iron-red, although the new\r\n _rouge d’or_ is freely used in the rest of the decoration. I learn\r\n from my friend Colonel Croft Lyons that the arms on this plate are\r\n those of Leake Okeover, who was born in 1701. The initials, repeated\r\n four times on the margin, L. M. O., stand for Leake and his wife Mary.\r\n The plate, therefore, cannot well have been painted before, say, 1725.\r\n\r\n [107] This class of Kuang yao must not be confused with the old heavy\r\n pieces of Yuan ware mentioned on p. 77.\r\n\r\n [108] I quote, with a few contractions, from the edition of 1774.\r\n\r\n [109] I have examined the Korean pottery in the British Museum, at\r\n Sèvres, and that in some of the German museums, but I have not seen\r\n the specimens in the Ethnographical Museum at Hamburg, which are said\r\n to be very remarkable.\r\n\r\n [110] For an account of the exploration of Sawankalok, see _Man_,\r\n the volume for 1901. By the kind permission of Mr. Read I have been\r\n able to closely examine the specimens which are now deposited in the\r\n British Museum.\r\n\r\n [111] We may mention that the Japanese appear also to give the name\r\n of Kochi to other wares, especially to the deep blue and turquoise\r\n porcelain with decoration in ribbed cloisons which we have attributed\r\n to early Ming times.\r\n\r\n [112] We may compare with this the impulse given, some four hundred\r\n years later, in Europe, to the spread of the use of porcelain at the\r\n time when tea was first introduced in the West.\r\n\r\n [113] See page 66. This Sung ware is known to the Japanese as\r\n ‘_Temmoku_,’ and is highly esteemed by them.\r\n\r\n [114] Many, however, of these so-called Jesuit plates were probably\r\n painted at King-te-chen at a later date. Christianity was finally and\r\n ruthlessly crushed in Japan after the rebellion of 1637: in China\r\n it was tolerated up to the close of the reign of Kang-he (1721). I\r\n must refer back to a quotation from the Père D’Entrecolles given on\r\n p. 133. See also a curious note in Marryat, where a statuette of\r\n Quanyin, with the boy patron of learning, is described as ‘a Virgin\r\n and Child.’--_Pottery and Porcelain_, p. 293.\r\n\r\n [115] In the Dresden collection are several cases full of this early\r\n Japanese blue and white.\r\n\r\n [116] The Chinese, however, were given much greater liberty than the\r\n Dutch.\r\n\r\n [117] See the South Kensington handbook on Japanese pottery, p. 86.\r\n In the chapter on Japanese ceramics contained in the magnificently\r\n illustrated _History of the Arts of Japan_, published in 1901 in\r\n connection with the Paris Exhibition, a little further light is thrown\r\n on the history of porcelain in that country. But in this work and in\r\n the other guides published at the time of our American and European\r\n exhibitions (and the same may be said of the Japanese report contained\r\n in the South Kensington handbook), the same scanty materials are\r\n served up again and again.\r\n\r\n [118] _Ambassades Mémorables de la Compagnie des Indes Orientales des\r\n Provinces Unies vers les Empereurs du Japon_, Amsterdam, 1680, Part\r\n II. p. 102. I take the reference from Marryat, but I have not been\r\n able to find the book.\r\n\r\n [119] We know of no Chinese type to which we can refer this\r\n decoration. Certain points of resemblance have been found with the\r\n work of the great contemporary Japanese artist Tanyu. The most\r\n characteristic _motifs_ are the tiger, the dancing boy with long\r\n sleeves, and the straw hedge.\r\n\r\n [120] The ‘old Japan’ was at one time closely copied at King-te-chen\r\n for exportation to Europe. (_Cf._ PL. XXIV. 1.)\r\n\r\n [121] The composition of the Owari porcelain is more normal, the\r\n silica only amounting to 65 per cent.; but as the paste contains\r\n little or no lime, it comes nearer to the hard porcelain of Berlin\r\n than to the milder Chinese type.\r\n\r\n [122] Much, however, of the china-stone of Cornwall differs little in\r\n composition from the Imari stone; but the latter contains, as we have\r\n said, soda, in place of the more usual potash.\r\n\r\n [123] It is to this _Koransha_, I understand, that we are indebted for\r\n the historical notices on Japanese porcelain that have appeared on the\r\n occasion of our successive international exhibitions (see above, p.\r\n 183 note).\r\n\r\n [124] Captain Brinkley speaks of the lower edge being serrated, but I\r\n have never seen any specimen of this serration.\r\n\r\n [125] Another seal was granted to Zengoro with the inscription\r\n (reading in Chinese) _Hopin chi liu_ (PL. B. 24). This refers to an\r\n old tradition that Shun, a Chinese emperor of very early date, had,\r\n before his accession to the throne, made pottery at a place called\r\n Hopin, in Honan. This story is told by Ssuma Chien, the ‘Herodotus of\r\n China,’ and would be well known to scholars in Japan. These characters\r\n are sometimes found on Japanese ware. (_Cf._ Bushell, chap. i., and\r\n the Franks catalogue, fig. 191, where, however, the words are wrongly\r\n interpreted.) Yeiraku, I should add, may be also rendered ‘long\r\n content.’\r\n\r\n [126] This question of the relation between the Kishiu, the Kochi of\r\n the Japanese, and our class of old Ming wares with coloured glazes,\r\n is full of difficulties. It remains for some Japanese connoisseur,\r\n who is at the same time both an expert in ceramics and a good Chinese\r\n scholar, to clear it up.\r\n\r\n [127] This work is analysed by Dr. Hirth in his essay on _Ancient\r\n Chinese Porcelain_ already referred to.\r\n\r\n [128] Dr. Meyer, who brought this collection together, has always\r\n supported the theory that in early days no true porcelain was ever\r\n made except in China. In support of this he points to the specimens,\r\n including ‘wasters,’ from Sawankalok in Siam, in this collection,\r\n as being all of stoneware. We have seen (p. 173) that more recent\r\n excavations in the same neighbourhood have brought to light fragments\r\n of true porcelain of undoubted local manufacture. It is true, however,\r\n that most of the examples of celadon in the Dresden collection are of\r\n what we should call a kaolinic stoneware.\r\n\r\n [129] I suppose that Franks, who refers to this notice, was satisfied\r\n that the present really consisted of Chinese ware. Many slips have\r\n been made in quoting this passage, but I will only point out that\r\n Nureddin, who died in 1173, has no claim to the title of caliph.\r\n\r\n [130] This belief, however, long lingered not only in the East, but\r\n even in Europe. According to some, if poison was present, the bowl\r\n lost its transparency; others state that the liquid would boil up in\r\n the centre, remaining clear round the edge. In a French comic poem,\r\n written as late as 1716, among other merits possessed by vessels of\r\n Chinese porcelain, it is claimed for them that--\r\n\r\n    ‘Ils font connaître les mystères\r\n     Des bouillons à la Brinvillière.’\r\n\r\n\r\n [131] By far the greater number of the fragments are of local or at\r\n least of Saracenic origin, and many of them may be as old as the date\r\n mentioned in the text. But at Fostât, at all events, some of the\r\n pot-sherds are of a much later date. There are important collections\r\n of fragments from these rubbish-heaps both in the British Museum and\r\n at South Kensington.\r\n\r\n [132] Professor Karabacek of Vienna quotes from the encyclopædist\r\n Hâdji Khalifa, who died in 1658: ‘The precious magnificent celadon\r\n dishes seen in his time were manufactured and exported at Martabani,\r\n in Pegu.’\r\n\r\n [133] The little bowl of apple-green porcelain in the British Museum,\r\n ‘garnished’ with a mounting of the time of Henry VIII., has perhaps as\r\n long a European history. The two ‘Trenchard’ bowls (in spite of the\r\n later date of the mounting) probably came to England in 1506.\r\n\r\n [134] I think that it is not unlikely that during the time that\r\n King-te-chen lay waste, kilns may have been erected somewhere in\r\n the neighbourhood of the Canton river, and that from these kilns\r\n originated much of the rough ware, hastily decorated in blue, that\r\n reached India and Persia in such quantities at this time (_cf._ the\r\n statement of Raynal quoted on p. 166). We have spoken in the last\r\n chapter of the influence of these events upon the Japanese trade.\r\n\r\n [135] I am referring, of course, to Stuart times. In the eighteenth\r\n century the so-called Gombroon ware was of Persian origin, and\r\n recognised as such in England.\r\n\r\n [136] The word ‘china’ is used in this sense, I think, by no other\r\n European nation.\r\n\r\n [137] See, however, for the Portuguese merchants who sold porcelain in\r\n France, the note on page 230.\r\n\r\n [138] The Abbé Raynal, writing about 1770, says that connoisseurs\r\n divide Oriental porcelain into six classes--‘_truitée_, _vieille\r\n blanche_, _de Japon_, _de Chine_, _le Japon Chiné et la porcelaine des\r\n Indes_.’\r\n\r\n [139] Marryat’s extracts are unfortunately often carelessly quoted;\r\n nor is it easy in all cases to control them by reference to the\r\n originals.\r\n\r\n [140] August II. certainly bought a collection of porcelain from the\r\n Bassetouche family for 6750 thalers. It would be interesting to know\r\n of what wares this collection consisted. The only further additions\r\n until quite recent times have been to the European department.\r\n\r\n [141] The tradition of the ‘dinner-service’ made in China for Charles\r\n V., and presented by him to Moritz of Saxony (or, as others say,\r\n captured from him by that prince), belongs to the same category of\r\n stories as that of the crusader’s cup. No such commission as this\r\n was possible at so early a date, and there is nothing in the Dresden\r\n collection that could be connected with such a service.\r\n\r\n [142]\r\n\r\n        ‘Menez-moi chez les Portugais\r\n         Nous y verrons à peu de frais\r\n         Des marchandises de la Chine\r\n    ... de la porcelaine fine,’ etc.--Scarron, _Paris Burlesque_.\r\n\r\n\r\n [143] In 1689 Madame de Sévigné notes the quantity of Oriental\r\n porcelain imported at L’Orient.\r\n\r\n [144] Are we to identify these with some huge Imari vases, now in the\r\n Louvre, with coats of arms bearing the French lilies and the label of\r\n Orleans? Some similar vases, with the same arms, have lately been seen\r\n in dealers’ shops in London.\r\n\r\n [145] The catalogues of Gersaint and of some other early French\r\n collections may be found at South Kensington.\r\n\r\n [146] Passeri, writing in 1752 in favour of the then neglected\r\n majolica, claims that ‘la parte brutale dell’ uomo sarà a favor delle\r\n porcellane, ma l’intellettuale e raziocinativa giudicherà a favor\r\n delle nostre majoliche.’\r\n\r\n [147] Recent researches in the archives of Venice have proved that\r\n Oriental porcelain was comparatively abundant in Venice at the\r\n beginning of the sixteenth century. Dr. Ludwig has shown me extracts\r\n from the inventory of the property of a rich ‘cittadino’ who died in\r\n 1526, in which can be distinguished plain white, blue and white, and\r\n porcelain decorated with red, green, and gold.\r\n\r\n [148] It is quite possible that Palissy may have tried his hand at\r\n this problem. M. Solon has suggested that in the many years’ labour\r\n at Saintes (when attempting especially to imitate ‘the cup with white\r\n enamel’) Palissy was really seeking to make porcelain.\r\n\r\n [149] I take the following from the excellent catalogue of the Ceramic\r\n Museum at Limoges, by E. Garnier: ‘1125. _Pot à Pommade, de forme\r\n cylindrique godronné à la partie inférieure et décoré en bleu d’une\r\n bande de lambrequins. Marque_ A.P.’ Some other small pieces in this\r\n museum are classed as Rouen porcelain.\r\n\r\n [150] Professor Church allows that ‘the substance of some of these\r\n statuettes is distinctly porcellanous.’ He found, however, in a\r\n fragment of this ware as much as 79·5 per cent. of silica, and only\r\n 12·5 per cent. of alumina (_Cantor Lectures_, 1881).\r\n\r\n [151] This feeling is well expressed in a contemporary drinking-song:--\r\n\r\n    ‘To drink is a Christian diversion\r\n     Unfit for your Turk or your Persian;\r\n     Let Mohammedan fools live by heathenish rules,\r\n     And get drunk over tea-cups and coffee,\r\n     But let British lads sing, give a rouse for the king,\r\n     A fig for your Turk and your Sophi.’\r\n\r\n The punch-bowl of porcelain, however, came to the rescue about this\r\n time.\r\n\r\n [152] In the porcelain gallery at Dresden may be seen (together with\r\n one or two small lumps of gold and silver, the results of Böttger’s\r\n alchemistic experiments) some snuff-boxes and little flasks of a\r\n marbled glass, made by Tschirnhaus at an early date. It is probable\r\n that the latter experimenter’s researches lay rather in the way of a\r\n frit-made soft paste, on the same lines as the contemporary attempts\r\n in France.\r\n\r\n [153] And yet, forty years later (so well was the secret kept), it was\r\n maintained by practical authorities in France that the Saxon ware was\r\n no true porcelain, but only some kind of hard enamel. See Hellot’s\r\n _Mémoire_, quoted below.\r\n\r\n [154] We hear, however, of Dutch potters being engaged as early as\r\n 1708, and with their assistance Böttger, in 1709, made some imitations\r\n of Delft ware.\r\n\r\n [155] In a contemporary German pamphlet, which I only know from a\r\n French translation (_Secret des Vrais Porcelaines de la Chine et de\r\n Saxe_, Paris, 1752), a certain ‘_spath alkalin_’ is mentioned as an\r\n important element in Saxon porcelain, and this substance is identified\r\n with the petuntse of the Père D’Entrecolles.\r\n\r\n [156] If this colour is derived from the purple of Cassius, as seems\r\n probable, it is an important instance of the early use of this pigment\r\n upon porcelain.\r\n\r\n [157] Above all the famous ‘Swan Service’ of 1736, Kändler’s\r\n masterpiece.\r\n\r\n [158] We had in England until lately an unrivalled collection of\r\n these little groups--priceless specimens of the best period. They\r\n were exhibited by their owner, Mr. Massey Mainwaring, for some time\r\n at Bethnal Green. This collection has, however, now found its way to\r\n America.\r\n\r\n [159] On the other hand, as early as 1732 the Meissen ware was\r\n finding its way to the East. Quantities of little coffee-cups (known\r\n as _Türken Copjen_, corrupted into _Türken Köpfchen_) were sent to\r\n Constantinople to be re-exported to other Mohammedan countries.\r\n\r\n [160] We may remind the reader that it was a syndicate of Berlin\r\n merchants who at an earlier date sought, it is said, to purchase from\r\n Böttger his secret. There is little doubt, however, that the anecdotes\r\n about Ringler, which abound in the notices on German porcelain,\r\n are little more than ‘porcelain myths.’ Very similar anecdotes are\r\n told of the early days at Vincennes, and in Japan, as we have seen,\r\n such stories sometimes take a more tragical form. There is a strong\r\n temptation, no doubt, in traversing the somewhat arid ground of German\r\n ceramics, to fall back on such tales. At all events they belong to the\r\n class of _tendenz Mährchen_, and illustrate the difficulties to be\r\n overcome at that time in starting a new factory.\r\n\r\n [161] Not but that we have proof of his interest in the subject, as\r\n the following letter, dated Meissen, March 28, 1761, will show. It\r\n is written to Madame Camas, his _chère Maman_, who was then with the\r\n queen at Magdeburg:--‘I send you, my dear mamma, a little trifle,\r\n by way of keepsake and memento. You may use the box for your rouge,\r\n for your patches, or you may put snuff in it or bonbons or pills....\r\n I have ordered porcelain for all the world, for Schönhausen, for my\r\n sisters-in-law,--in fact I am rich in this brittle material only. And\r\n I hope the receivers will accept it as current money: for the truth\r\n is, we are poor as can be, good mamma. I have nothing left but my\r\n honour, my coat, my sword, and my porcelain.’--Carlyle’s _Frederick\r\n the Great_, Book xx. chap. vi. Marryat, who gives this letter in his\r\n notes, mixes up Carlyle’s comments with the text.\r\n\r\n [162] The Hohenzollern shield bears two sceptres in saltire _en\r\n surtout_.\r\n\r\n [163] Another account gives the credit to Von Löwenfinck, a porcelain\r\n painter from Meissen.\r\n\r\n [164] Politically, that is to say; for the town formed part of the\r\n ‘Pays d’Étrangers,’ and its commercial and social relations were still\r\n rather with Germany than with France.\r\n\r\n [165] I take these facts about the Hannong family from Sir A.\r\n Wollaston Franks’s _Catalogue of Continental Porcelain_, 1896.\r\n\r\n [166] In the same year we find Count Schimmelmann, who at a later date\r\n interested himself in the Copenhagen factory, selling by auction at\r\n Hamburg some of the vast stocks of Meissen china that Frederick had\r\n thrown on the market.\r\n\r\n [167] As a royal factory, however, it became extinct in 1864. See\r\n chap. xxiii.\r\n\r\n [168] Thus we have, during the Seven Years’ War, Frederick’s three\r\n bitter opponents--Maria Theresa in Austria, Elizabeth in Russia, and\r\n the Marquise de Pompadour in France--all taking an active interest\r\n in promoting the manufacture of porcelain, and this rivalry may have\r\n added to the zest of Frederick when he looted Meissen and sought to\r\n make Berlin take its place as the metropolis of porcelain.\r\n\r\n [169] An American writer has arranged the tests by which soft pastes\r\n may be distinguished from true porcelains under six heads. 1. _The\r\n file test._--Soft porcelain may be marked by a file. 2. _The foot\r\n test._--In hard porcelain the foot is generally rough and unglazed.\r\n This test is rather of value in distinguishing porcelain from fayence.\r\n 3. _The fire test._--Depending on the greater fusibility of the soft\r\n pastes. 4. _Chemical test._ 5. _Colour test._--Soft paste is generally\r\n mellow ivory by transmitted light, and this is especially true of\r\n ‘bone-ware.’ The hard paste tends to bluish shades. 6. _Fracture\r\n test._--The fracture is glassy to vitreous, and the glaze passes into\r\n the paste in the case of hard pastes (the subconchoidal splintery\r\n fracture is rather the point to observe); dry and chalky, and the\r\n glaze more or less separated from the paste in the case of soft\r\n pastes.--E. A. Barber, _Pottery and Porcelain of the United States_,\r\n New York, 1901.\r\n\r\n [170] De Réaumur, we must remember, had made some kind of hard-paste\r\n porcelain from Chinese materials. After that he fell back upon his\r\n devitrified glass. Something very similar had been made by Tschirnhaus\r\n many years before.\r\n\r\n [171] These, I think, are almost the only instances in which a\r\n distinctly seventeenth century decoration is to be found on porcelain.\r\n\r\n [172] These _trembleuse_ saucers of the early eighteenth century have\r\n a projecting ring into which the base of the teacup fits.\r\n\r\n [173] The extreme limits for this mark are 1712-62, but Chaffers says\r\n it was not used before 1730, according to another authority not before\r\n 1735. De Frasnay, in a note to his curious little poem in praise of\r\n fayence (1735), says: ‘_le secret du beau rouge n’est guère connu\r\n en France que d’un très petit nombre de personnes_.’ The point is\r\n of interest in connection with the origin of the _famille rose_ in\r\n China. We may here note that the minute quantity of gold--the source\r\n of all these pink and purple colours--is not necessarily introduced in\r\n the form of the tin salt, the purple of Cassius. But this difficult\r\n question will be best treated in connection with the history of glass.\r\n\r\n [174] Generally known as the Duc de Bourbon (1710-40). He was an\r\n enthusiast for the art of the Far East. An important work on Chinese\r\n art was published under his auspices in 1735. He imitated the painted\r\n hangings of the East, and even attempted to make Japanese lacquer.\r\n After his death, the two brothers Dubois, _épiciers à Chantilly_,\r\n migrated to Vincennes, and the Chantilly works were for a time\r\n neglected. See Gustave Macon, _Les arts dans la Maison de Condé_, 1903.\r\n\r\n [175] Of the many European imitations of the ‘Kakiyemon’ style the\r\n Chantilly is most successful, while the ‘Old Japan’ was best copied\r\n at Chelsea. No European imitation in porcelain of the Chinese blue\r\n and white approaches in brilliancy that made in Delft ware in the\r\n seventeenth century.\r\n\r\n [176] The porcelain of Saint-Cloud and Chantilly is well represented\r\n in the Fitzhenry collection.\r\n\r\n [177] Some twenty miles south of Paris, not far from Corbeil.\r\n\r\n [178] The name is written ‘Sèves’ in English catalogues of the\r\n eighteenth century, and the same form is found sometimes in\r\n contemporary French writings. We may compare the favourite signature\r\n ‘Fédéric’ of the Prussian king.\r\n\r\n [179] _Mémoire Historique pour la Manufacture, rédigé en 1781 par\r\n Bachelier_, re-edited, with preface and notes, by G. Gouellain, Paris,\r\n 1878.\r\n\r\n [180] See the note on p. 286. It would seem that the first successes\r\n at Vincennes were, in a measure, dependent upon the temporary breaking\r\n up of the factory at Chantilly on the death of the Duc de Bourbon in\r\n 1740.\r\n\r\n [181] At a later time this man had a contract for the delivery of the\r\n paste, the secret of which he preserved, at a fixed rate per pound. In\r\n one year he is said to have received for this 800,000 livres!\r\n\r\n [182] Such is my general impression, but M. Garnier, I see, speaks\r\n highly of his artistic capabilities. Bachelier founded in 1763 a free\r\n school of design, one of the few institutions of the old régime that\r\n have survived the many changes of government. It still exists as the\r\n _École Nationale des Beaux-Arts_.\r\n\r\n [183] By this we get a hint as to the kind of ware made at Vincennes\r\n at the commencement, when under the influence of Chantilly.\r\n\r\n [184] The account-books of these sales are still preserved. M.\r\n Davillier, in his little book on _Les porcelaines de Sèvres et Madame\r\n du Barry_, quotes the record of purchases made (at a later date, for\r\n the most part) by the royal family, by Madame du Deffand, and by M. de\r\n Voltaire. The latter bought, for 120 livres, ‘_Deux bustes de mondit\r\n Sieur, en biscuit_.’ Besides this, large sales were made yearly to the\r\n trade.\r\n\r\n [185] The above description is that given by the Prince de Ligne in\r\n his memoirs. In the Johanneum at Dresden there is now to be seen a\r\n ‘bouquet’ which in every way corresponds to the prince’s account.\r\n The Meissen works for long had the credit of this trophy, but it is\r\n now acknowledged that it is identical with the present sent by the\r\n dauphine, in 1748, to her father, the Elector of Saxony. M. Davillier\r\n quotes a curious account from a contemporary memoir describing the\r\n difficulties and expenses incurred in transporting this ‘bouquet’ from\r\n Paris to Dresden. Are we, then, to regard it as the actual present\r\n given by M. de Fulvi to the queen, or as a duplicate?\r\n\r\n [186] See for this and other references to porcelain in the _chronique\r\n scandaleuse_ of the day, the little book of M. Davillier quoted above.\r\n\r\n [187] Some attention was paid to the housing and comfort of the\r\n workmen at the new establishment, but Bachelier makes no mention of\r\n ‘the gardens, cascades, fruit-trees, groves, woods, and a small chase\r\n for the artists, who enjoyed to hunt the stag and the wild boar none\r\n the less for their sedentary lives in the art palace’ (Marryat, p.\r\n 414). On the contrary, we are told that in a few years the houses and\r\n workshops were already threatening to fall down on the workmen’s heads.\r\n\r\n [188] M. Bertin was himself a great collector of Chinese porcelain.\r\n In the _avertissement_ of the catalogue of his collection which was\r\n sold in Paris in 1815, we are told that through the medium of the Père\r\n Amiot he obtained many choice specimens, some of them direct presents\r\n from the Chinese emperor. We have already alluded to Kien-lung’s\r\n interest in exotic wares, and to the influence of these upon the\r\n native decoration.\r\n\r\n [189] In the _fond lapis caillouté_ the deep blue ground is painted\r\n with fine veins of gold, to imitate the pyrites which generally\r\n accompanies the native stone (lapis lazuli). It was used as early as\r\n 1758 (see Wallace collection, Gallery XVIII., Case C.).\r\n\r\n [190] As many as one hundred and sixty pieces, it is said, were\r\n carried off during a fire at Tsarskoe Selo. Some of these were\r\n afterwards repurchased by the Tsar Nicholas.\r\n\r\n [191] Marryat quotes a passage to the following effect from a little\r\n work published at Venice soon after the death of the favourite.\r\n Praising the good taste of the ‘_Madame Marchesa_,’ the writer states\r\n that this was, above all, manifested in the adornment of her table.\r\n All the porcelain was expressly manufactured for her at Sèvres, and\r\n was of _a rose colour mixed with gold_. The value amounted to 257,000\r\n livres, and no sovereign possessed a service of equal beauty.\r\n\r\n [192] It is found as a ground on pieces bearing the earliest\r\n letter-marks, so that it is difficult to accept the statement that it\r\n was first made by Xhrouet, a painter of landscapes, in 1757.\r\n\r\n [193] Much of it found its way to England, and was there decorated in\r\n the old Sèvres style, both in London and in the West.\r\n\r\n [194] For a detailed description of these deposits and their\r\n geological relations, see Brongniart’s great work.\r\n\r\n [195] Napoleon at one time sent Daru to Sèvres to convey to\r\n Brongniart, in the most lively terms, his dissatisfaction with what he\r\n called the simplicity and tameness of the designs in use at Sèvres.\r\n Every piece should, he protests, ‘_dire quelque chose_.’ Every plate\r\n should record glorious deeds, the capture of the enemy’s towns, or the\r\n triumphant return of the victors.\r\n\r\n [196] We must, however, place some of these discoveries to the credit\r\n of the staff of the Viennese factory, and Dihl again, the chemist of\r\n the porcelain works in the Rue de Bondy, has a claim to others.\r\n\r\n [197] The death of M. Garnier occurred since the above was written.\r\n\r\n [198] The use of a bone-paste ware of the ‘Spode’ type is, however,\r\n now prevalent not only in many parts of the continent, but porcelain\r\n of this kind is now largely made in the United States.\r\n\r\n [199] Unless it be in the catalogue drawn up by Sir A. W. Franks\r\n for his collection of continental china. The ceramic collection in\r\n the Hamburg Museum has also been very thoroughly catalogued by Dr.\r\n Brinckmann.\r\n\r\n [200] It is curious to find Venice at this time exporting porcelain to\r\n the East, for at an earlier period it was through this town that so\r\n much Oriental porcelain and fayence reached Europe.\r\n\r\n [201] This Venetian china, either of hard paste or of the hybrid\r\n class, must not be confused with the opaque glass, the _lattimo_,\r\n or, more properly, _Latisuol_, ware, made about 1730 in imitation of\r\n porcelain both at Murano, and also near Bassano.\r\n\r\n [202] Compare with this the use of steatite, a magnesian rock, from\r\n the Lizard, at Worcester, and at other West of England factories. The\r\n Chinese have also at times made use of a steatitic rock.\r\n\r\n [203] Marryat (p. 451) gives an interesting account of this\r\n enterprising man. He was occupied also in the draining of marshes, the\r\n improvement of agriculture, and the promotion of commerce.\r\n\r\n [204] With this appointment we may perhaps connect the elaborate\r\n trophy of white porcelain at South Kensington. The figures of slaves\r\n on which this is supported are modelled after those of Tacca on the\r\n celebrated monument at Leghorn. This piece is attributed, however, to\r\n the Capo di Monte factory.\r\n\r\n [205] The word ‘china’ is sometimes used in Spain in the same vague\r\n sense as in England, but the name seems only to have come in with the\r\n Staffordshire ware so largely imported in the last century. Note,\r\n however, that the factory at Buen Retiro was known as La China.\r\n\r\n [206] I quote this remarkable passage from Sir A. W. Franks’s paper on\r\n the origin of the Chelsea porcelain works (_Archæol. Journal_, 1862).\r\n Marryat misquotes and misinterprets the passage.\r\n\r\n [207] One possible exception to this very general statement may be\r\n found in a pamphlet quoted by Mr. Solon, _Instructions how to make\r\n as good china as was ever sold by the East India Company_ by A.\r\n Hill, London, 1716. According to this writer, fragments of Oriental\r\n china were to be finely ground and mixed with fluxing and plastic\r\n materials to form a paste. Now there is evidence that at a much later\r\n date ‘potsherds’ were imported from China, and ground up to form an\r\n ingredient of the porcelain, both at Bow and at Worcester.\r\n\r\n [208] The memorandum-book of Duesbury, the future porcelain king,\r\n begins in 1742. He was then working, on weekly wages, as an\r\n ‘enameller’ of china figures. But was the ware that he was decorating\r\n at this time a true porcelain?\r\n\r\n [209] Mr. Burton says that at the present day the Staffordshire\r\n porcelain is composed of bone-ash 6 parts, china-stone 4 parts, and\r\n kaolin 3½ parts.\r\n\r\n [210] Mr. Willett, of Brighton, has a pair of ‘goat and bee’ jugs in\r\n silver, with the hall-mark of 1739.\r\n\r\n [211] There is an interesting series of these very early pieces in the\r\n British Museum. A white ware salt-cellar, with crayfish in relief, has\r\n the triangle mark. A jug, in the form of a grotesque Chinaman, is a\r\n good specimen of the early paste. We notice the same waxy look in the\r\n paste that we find in the Saint-Cloud ware. The surface, however, is\r\n generally grayer.\r\n\r\n [212] In 1758 we find an advertisement of a house to let in ‘China\r\n Walk,’ Chelsea.\r\n\r\n [213] Both Gouyn and his successor, Sprimont, were very likely\r\n Walloons from the neighbourhood of Liége. In a contemporary work,\r\n however, the latter is spoken of as ‘a French artist of great\r\n abilities.’ Rouguet’s _Present State of the Arts_, 1755.\r\n\r\n [214] Note the term ‘earthenware.’ As in a much earlier proclamation\r\n of the time of Charles II. (forbidding the importation of painted\r\n earthenware, except ‘those of China, and stone bottles and jugs’), the\r\n word is used officially to include porcelain.\r\n\r\n [215] Such a regulation would seem to show that in England the\r\n enamel-painters were in the field earlier than the manufacturers of\r\n porcelain.\r\n\r\n [216] The later date is supported by the statement of Sprimont in his\r\n ‘Case,’ that ‘the ground flat of the manufacturer has gone on still\r\n increasing,’ for we know that the works were enlarged in 1757. The\r\n expression ‘crowned head’ applies better to the King of Prussia than\r\n to the Elector of Saxony. In 1760, as we have seen, Count Schimmelmann\r\n was at Hamburg selling, on behalf of Frederick, part of the vast\r\n stocks accumulated at Meissen.\r\n\r\n [217] In a London paper of December 4, 1763, appeared the following\r\n statement--I quote from Mr. Nightingale’s book,--‘A few days since,\r\n his R. Highness the Duke of Cumberland was at Mr. Sprimont’s\r\n manufactory at Chelsea, and we are informed that his Highness will\r\n shortly purchase the same, that so matchless an art should not be\r\n lost.’ A week later, however, a formal contradiction of this report\r\n appeared in another paper, in the form of a note at the end of an\r\n advertisement of the sale of the contents of Sprimont’s factory. All\r\n this has a very modern air. We have a skilful combination of the\r\n _ballon d’essai_ and the puff preliminary.\r\n\r\n [218] This collection has lately disappeared from its old home in the\r\n Geological Museum, where it had been the delight of two generations of\r\n collectors. Most of the specimens have, however, quite recently been\r\n discovered at South Kensington.\r\n\r\n [219] Much of the white ware at this time was decorated outside by\r\n ‘chamberers.’ Compare the memorandum-book of Duesbury quoted below.\r\n\r\n [220] The advertisement of these sales in contemporary newspapers, and\r\n many of the catalogues, have been collected together and reprinted by\r\n the late Mr. J. E. Nightingale.\r\n\r\n [221] Before this time the gold had been simply laid on with\r\n japanner’s size and only gently heated. See Burton’s _English\r\n Porcelain_, p. 46.\r\n\r\n [222] There was a revival of the practice of mounting, or, to use\r\n the old term, ‘garnishing’ porcelain in ormolu about this time. At\r\n Boulton’s works at Soho, near Birmingham, famous, a little later, in\r\n the history of the steam-engine, these metal mountings were largely\r\n made, and Wedgwood began to apply them to some of his wares (see\r\n Nightingale, p. xxxiv.).\r\n\r\n [223] I can find no confirmation of the statement that Roubiliac\r\n modelled figures for Sprimont. Certain statuettes bearing an R.\r\n impressed on the paste have been attributed to him. There is no\r\n reference to any such work in the life of the artist by M. Le Roy de\r\n St. Croix (Lyons, 1886). Roubiliac, who died in 1762, was already\r\n in 1750 at the height of his reputation, and fully employed in more\r\n important work.\r\n\r\n [224] Mr. Burton points out that it would be quite impossible to make\r\n a translucent ware with the materials of the first patent. He doubts\r\n also the use of bone-ash in the earlier porcelain of Bow, the paste\r\n of which is distinctly of the Saint-Cloud type. I think, however,\r\n that there can be little doubt but that the ‘virgin earth’ refers to\r\n bone-ash, and the fragments from Bow in which this substance has been\r\n found seem to be derived from an early ware.\r\n\r\n [225] Specimens from this find may be seen at the British Museum,\r\n at South Kensington, and in the late Jermyn Street collection.\r\n An interesting and detailed account of the fragments, which were\r\n excavated and arranged by Mr. Higgins of the adjacent match-works,\r\n will be found in Chaffers’s _Marks_, pp. 908 _seq._\r\n\r\n [226] This difficulty of making the decoration keep pace with the\r\n outturn of the kilns was felt at this time at other kilns--from\r\n King-te-chen to Sèvres and Worcester. Recourse was more and more had\r\n to the outside enameller--the ‘chamberer’--on the one hand, and to\r\n transfer-printing on the other.\r\n\r\n [227] This document is exhibited at the British Museum by the side of\r\n the punch-bowl.\r\n\r\n [228] These figures are probably exaggerated. Sprimont, a little\r\n earlier, says that he was employing at Chelsea ‘at least one hundred\r\n hands.’\r\n\r\n [229] ‘Printed teas and mugs’ are mentioned in Bowcocke’s\r\n memorandum-book in 1756.\r\n\r\n [230] See Nightingale’s _English Porcelain_, pp. li. _seq._, and\r\n Bemrose’s _Bow, Chelsea, and Derby Porcelain_, pp. 153 _seq._\r\n\r\n [231] The rococo vases, however, of this ware in the British Museum\r\n seem to be of a somewhat later date, if we take Sprimont’s work at\r\n Chelsea as a criterion.\r\n\r\n [232] These ‘Darby figars’ may possibly have been of earthenware.\r\n There are some richly painted statuettes of this material at South\r\n Kensington, though these indeed seem to be of a somewhat later date.\r\n\r\n [233] Mr. Bemrose, in his work on _Bow, Chelsea, and Derby Porcelain_,\r\n gives photographic reproductions of several pages from Duesbury’s\r\n work-book.\r\n\r\n [234] These details I take from the notes of a man who had formerly\r\n practical experience of such work--Mr. Haslem, in his _Old Derby China\r\n Factory_.\r\n\r\n [235] And yet the colours are sometimes brilliant and effective--for\r\n example, on a large dish or tray of Spode ware at South Kensington\r\n (see below, p. 373). This strange ‘breaking-down’ of the old Japanese\r\n patterns may be compared to the scattered fragments of the original\r\n Greek design that we see on the pre-Roman coins of Gaul and Britain.\r\n\r\n [236] It appears from a correspondence that has been preserved that\r\n in 1791 the second Duesbury was looking out for royal support. ‘A\r\n gentleman about the court’ whom he consulted recommended him to seek\r\n the patronage of the Duke of Clarence, for, said he, ‘the duke is the\r\n _only prince that pays the tradespeople_.’ At that time there was\r\n great jealousy of the Worcester works, where the king had lately made\r\n large purchases.\r\n\r\n [237] Why _Tonquin_, of all places? We should rather have expected to\r\n find Nankin or Canton, as at Bow.\r\n\r\n [238] See the engraving in the _Gentleman’s Magazine_ for August 1752.\r\n This was in the nature of a puff. In the corner we read ‘A sale of the\r\n Manufacture will begin at the Worcester Music Meeting on September\r\n 20th, with great variety of ware and, ’tis said, at a moderate price.’\r\n Edward Cave, the originator of the _Gentleman’s Magazine_, and ‘the\r\n father of parliamentary reporting,’ was an important shareholder of\r\n the Worcester works.\r\n\r\n [239] Steatite is essentially a silicate of magnesia. We have seen\r\n that a soapy rock, probably of this nature, entered at times into the\r\n composition of the porcelain made at King-te-chen. At a later time\r\n silicate of magnesia, in various forms, has found its way into the\r\n hybrid pastes of Italy and Spain.\r\n\r\n [240] These two buildings may be probably traced back to the Temple of\r\n Vespasian, in the Forum, and to the Pyramid of Cestius respectively.\r\n Hancock must have got his materials from French and Italian engravings\r\n after Claude and Pannini.\r\n\r\n [241] Dr. Johnson was for a long time a close neighbour--his\r\n well-known interest in the manufacture of porcelain must have brought\r\n him into contact with the Baxter family. We find a Baxter mentioned in\r\n Bowcocke’s notes as early as 1751. See Chaffers, p. 896.\r\n\r\n [242] The teapot in the Schreiber collection with the mark ‘Allen,\r\n Lowestoft,’ must be regarded as a _supercherie_. The painting on it\r\n of a crucifixion is evidently by a Chinese hand. This teapot has,\r\n however, been connected with an Allen of Lowestoft, a porcelain\r\n enameller and amateur glass-stainer.\r\n\r\n [243] Some recent discoveries of moulds make it, however, probable\r\n that the early wares of Worcester and Bow were imitated at Lowestoft.\r\n\r\n [244] We are told that the first three of these substances are _to be\r\n fritted together_, but this would be manifestly impossible. The recipe\r\n is curious as being an anticipation of the materials used by Spode\r\n thirty years later. But we must receive most of these recipes that\r\n have thus come down to us _cum grano_.\r\n\r\n [245] This ‘soapy rock’ was at once identified with the steatite of\r\n the Lizard. The other porcelain experts, from Worcester and from\r\n Liverpool, who visited Cornwall about this time, seem to have devoted\r\n their attention more especially to this substance. They were thus, to\r\n some extent, on a false scent, for the Père D’Entrecolles probably\r\n somewhat exaggerated the importance of this _Wha-she_, and, moreover,\r\n as has been shown by later French investigation, most of the material\r\n of soapy consistency employed at King-te-chen is no true steatite or\r\n magnesian silicate, but rather a more fusible variety of the petuntse,\r\n containing much mica.\r\n\r\n [246] Was Frye, the painter of Bow, who first made use of the American\r\n earth, also a quaker? Cookworthy and Champion, it appears, first\r\n became acquainted with one another through the medium of one of the\r\n Bristol Frys, and it is known that moulds and patterns from Bow were\r\n used at Plymouth. It is at least remarkable that we should be indebted\r\n for our knowledge of the constitution of Chinese porcelain, in the\r\n first place, to a Jesuit father, and then to a member of the Society\r\n of Friends; while, on the other hand, Böttger--like Cookworthy, a\r\n druggist--was an adept in the dark arts.\r\n\r\n [247] Besides the factory mentioned in this letter, we hear from the\r\n diary of Dr. Pococke that as early as 1750 a white ware with reliefs\r\n was made at the ‘Lowris China house’ with ‘soapy-rock from Lizard\r\n Point.’ A sauce-boat marked ‘Bristoll’ is referred to these works in\r\n the _Guide to English Pottery in the British Museum_, p. 109.\r\n\r\n [248] Lauraguais (Comte de), Duc de Brancas, born 1733; died 1824.\r\n\r\n [249] See p. 306. At Strawberry Hill was ‘Michael Angelo’s Bacchus,\r\n made in the china of the Comte de Lauraguais, from the collection of\r\n the Comte de Caylus’ (Walpole’s _Works_, ii. 405 _seq._).\r\n\r\n [250] By Champion, at least, at a later time. The cross swords have\r\n in some cases been subsequently obliterated (PL. E. 84). Mr. Owen\r\n thinks that this was in consequence of a quarrel with the custom-house\r\n authorities in 1775.\r\n\r\n [251] And for tin also. The mark was adopted, no doubt, in honour\r\n of the ‘premier’ product of Cornwall. It would, however, be more in\r\n place on a ware with an opaque tin glaze, such as the soft paste of\r\n Chantilly.\r\n\r\n [252] So at Sèvres during the greater part of the last century the\r\n glaze has consisted of pegmatite, a very similar material to the\r\n Cornish growan-stone. The inconveniences of such a glaze have been\r\n pointed out by Vogt and others.\r\n\r\n [253] Of another workman employed by Champion, one Anthony Amatt, Mr.\r\n Hugh Owen gives some particulars. At one time, attempting to cross\r\n the Channel and find employment in France, he was arrested--at the\r\n instigation, it is said, of Wedgwood--and confined for some time as a\r\n State prisoner. Amatt died in 1851 at the age of ninety-two. Wedgwood\r\n was very active in preventing the emigration of English potters, who,\r\n he declared, were lured from their country by French and German agents\r\n (Meteyard’s _Wedgwood_, ii. p. 475).\r\n\r\n [254] There are also in existence some examples of undoubted Bristol\r\n hard-paste porcelain, covered with a soft lead glaze.\r\n\r\n [255] The porcelain made by Count Lauraguais, to judge by the analysis\r\n given above, must have contained even more kaolin than the Bristol\r\n ware.",
