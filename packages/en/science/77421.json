True_,\r\nTHE FORERUNNERS _does not take us on a stellar journey in a strictly\r\nliteral sense. But it would be carping indeed to insist on that when\r\nthe cybernetic regions explored therein are so galactic in scope, and\r\nso challengingly mysterious_.\r\n\r\n=The telepaths were a danger and a threat--to a world grown monstrous.\r\nBut the human mind can unlock a multitude of doors.=\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHe felt it when he awoke--the dull, persistent throbbing deep within\r\nhis head--and he knew that no human mind would be closed to him today.\r\n\r\nFor thirty-two of his thirty-four years Neville Brandt had been a\r\nnormal person. He had risen rapidly in the Cybernetics Division of\r\nCentral Metals, Inc., and was now one of the youngest experts in the\r\ncountry. But he was no longer normal.\r\n\r\nThe throbbing continued while he dressed and while he ate his\r\nbreakfast. It lingered with him during the drive to the jet port. It\r\nhung over him like a mantle of fire while he waited for the express,\r\nand it accompanied him aboard.\r\n\r\nThe jet train screamed along the monorail toward East City. Brandt\r\nwatched the landscape rush by in a blurred fantasia of color. He stared\r\nthrough the window at the fascinating smear until he became dizzy. And\r\nthe painful throbbing pounded on in his skull.\r\n\r\nThe express roared over the Appalachians, soaring up and through the\r\nman-made cuts and passes, and then sweeping down the eastern slope\r\nwith its speed unabated. Still, the pain persisted.\r\n\r\nSuddenly it was gone.\r\n\r\nBrandt closed his eyes and relaxed into the cushions of his seat, the\r\nabsence of the nagging pain soothing him like a balm. With his eyes\r\nshut, and smiling to himself, he sent telepathic feelers into the minds\r\nof his neighbors on the train. Gently, experimentally, his mental\r\nfingers touched one mind, then another. Reception was good.\r\n\r\nBrandt arrived at Centrals at his usual time. He entered his office and\r\ngreeted the same busy assemblage of secretaries, clerks and assistants\r\nhe encountered every morning. Then he promptly settled into his\r\ncustomary work routine.\r\n\r\nBut there was nothing usual about the way Brandt spent the first few\r\nminutes on this particular morning. He was testing his telepathic\r\ncapacity. He reached out carefully, extending himself until his mind\r\nshrieked in agony. Then, with as precise a mental movement as he could\r\nmanage, he began to slowly extend fringes of his power until he scooped\r\nup impressions from the restaurant at the far end of the street.\r\n\r\nHe held a waiter’s thoughts for a moment, then let them go. He probed\r\nfurther, to the bank on the next block. But all he could pick up was a\r\nmonotonous hum of unintelligible noise. He sagged against the back of\r\nhis chair until the pounding in his head eased.\r\n\r\nBrandt pulled a notebook from his coat pocket and checked his present\r\nrange limits against the figures which he had entered on his past\r\n“spell days.” It was still about two hundred yards! His range had\r\napparently stabilized itself at that distance. Only the _duration_ of\r\nhis effective control was increasing. The entries on the page read:\r\nMarch 14---3 min. March 31--12 min. April 19--39 min. June 3--1 hr., 17\r\nmin. August 14--2 hr., 58 min. September 24--4 hr., 19 min.\r\n\r\nHe closed the notebook and carefully tucked it into his breast pocket.\r\nWould today, November 4, follow the general pattern? If it did, he knew\r\nthat he would maintain control for almost eight hours!\r\n\r\nHe shrugged, turning his attentions to the people around him. Slowly\r\nhe probed their minds. He crept into dark corners and trod tortuous,\r\nnarrow paths, never really knowing what marvelous or horrible thing\r\nwould pop up at the next turning. It was a thrilling game--and\r\nsometimes a shocking one. Incredibly primitive and candid at times\r\nwere the thoughts of the innocent-looking girls, especially the slim\r\nbrunette at the--\r\n\r\n“Mr. Brandt!”\r\n\r\nHe looked up, startled. His private secretary was standing in front of\r\nhis desk, and from the annoyed tone of her voice he knew that she must\r\nhave spoken to him several times in an unsuccessful attempt to gain his\r\nattention.\r\n\r\n“Yes, Miss Cartwright?” He spoke guilelessly, pretending to be deeply\r\npreoccupied with the papers in his hand.\r\n\r\nThe girl’s eyes seemed to be laughing at him. Brandt wished that he\r\nknew what she was thinking. Why, he asked himself for the hundredth\r\ntime, did Ellen have to be one of the very few people whose minds\r\nremained always closed to him? Dear Ellen, aloof Ellen--Miss\r\nCartwright! How he ached to touch her!\r\n\r\nHer smile did not change. “Mr. Blanding would like to see you, Mr.\r\nBrandt,” she said, in a matter-of-fact tone.\r\n\r\nHe watched her move back to her desk, concentrating a question at her\r\nand getting no response. Shrugging, he arose quickly and left the\r\noffice.\r\n\r\nBlanding greeted him at the door. “Come in, Neville,” he said. “I’ve\r\nbeen expecting you.”\r\n\r\nWith a sudden, sharp apprehensiveness Brandt probed at Blanding’s\r\nmind. Nothing. It had happened before, and the completeness of the\r\nmental shields which were always drawn closely around Blanding and\r\nEllen excited fantastic possibilities. Yet, were they fantastic? If\r\nBrandt himself was a neophytic telepath, the probability of there\r\nbeing others more advanced, and with complete control and direction of\r\nthe power, must surely exist. And why stop at two or three? Why not a\r\nwell-developed society of telepaths still hidden from the government\r\nand successfully avoiding detection?\r\n\r\nBrandt stared uneasily at the smiling Blanding and a sudden,\r\novermastering fear pulsed through him.\r\n\r\n“Of course, there might be two societies,” Blanding said, his\r\nexpression utterly impassive. “One hidden from the government, and one\r\nwithin the government itself.”\r\n\r\nAll the blood drained from Brandt’s face. Blanding knew then. But\r\nhow--how--\r\n\r\n“How? Very simple.” Blanding motioned Brandt into a chair and handed\r\nhim a cigarette. “It’s all here,” the big man said, tapping his\r\nforehead.\r\n\r\nBrandt made no attempt to light the cigarette. He simply stared, his\r\npallor almost frightening.\r\n\r\n“You’ve done a remarkable job of logging and extrapolation, Neville,”\r\nBlanding went on. “But you made one serious mistake--a normal one under\r\nthe circumstances. You should have used your unique talent as an aid\r\nin a search for other telepaths who might have helped you to develop.”\r\nBlanding pushed his bulky frame out of the chair and walked to the\r\nwindow. “But children are always selfish with a new toy.”\r\n\r\nHe turned to Brandt. “Do you realize that because of your selfish\r\nattitude, it took Cartwright and myself six months of quite needless\r\nspeculative analysis to arrive at the truth about you. I mean, with\r\nabsolute certainty--”\r\n\r\n“So that’s it!” Brandt leapt to his feet. “Ellen’s one of us!”\r\n\r\nBlanding smiled tolerantly. “Yes, that’s it. But don’t look so\r\nstartled. We’re both master telepaths. Our ability goes far beyond your\r\npresent stage of development. But once you are caught up, once your\r\nattacks disappear--”\r\n\r\n“How long have you known?” Brandt asked, cutting him short with an\r\nurgent gesture.\r\n\r\n“Almost from the first. But I was not absolutely sure, as I’ve just\r\ntold you.”\r\n\r\n“And Ellen?”\r\n\r\n“We’re a team, Neville. It’s our job to find new telepaths and\r\ndetermine their potentials.”\r\n\r\nBrandt crushed his unlighted cigarette between his thumb and\r\nforefinger. “You mentioned _two_ societies of telepaths. Which one do\r\nyou belong to?”\r\n\r\nBlanding turned back to the window and spoke slowly. “There’s a small\r\nbut powerful group of master telepaths within the government, whose\r\ntask is to smoke out men and women who are determined to develop a\r\nnew and totally different form of society. The government knows the\r\ncapabilities of free-thinking telepaths, and what a threat they are to\r\nthe status quo. The people in control of the government don’t want our\r\npresent institutions changed. They don’t want to lose their power over\r\nthe people.\r\n\r\n“You see, the average citizen today has been conditioned to accept the\r\nalmost divine power of the State. His thinking is done for him by those\r\nin office. He gets what he needs and never needs what the government\r\ndoesn’t allot him. Only the telepaths question the government’s\r\nauthority, and only the telepaths have the ability to do anything about\r\nit.”\r\n\r\nBlanding paused an instant, then went on: “But the government isn’t\r\nconcerned with what may happen a hundred years from now. Oh, they know\r\ntelepathy is undoubtedly the next step in human evolution. They know\r\nthat you and I and all the rest are just the advance guard of the\r\nfuture. But their immediate concern is with the present.”\r\n\r\nBrandt sat down slowly. “How many known telepaths are there?”\r\n\r\n“About seven thousand scattered throughout the country,” Blanding\r\nreplied. “There may be an even larger number of untutored ones like\r\nyourself who haven’t been discovered yet.”\r\n\r\n“And now you think I’m ready to join the others?”\r\n\r\n“We do--yes.”\r\n\r\nBrandt leaned eagerly forward in his chair.\r\n\r\n“This evening,” Blanding answered his unspoken question. “Cartwright\r\nand I will take you to meet them.”\r\n\r\nBrandt returned to his own office, and nervously, impatiently, waited\r\nfor the day to end. He watched Ellen Cartwright, who remained busily\r\nabsorbed in her work, and did not once glance his way. He sent feelers\r\nout to her again and again. But she gave no sign that she was aware of\r\nthem, and when he probed, her mind was still impenetrable.\r\n\r\nToward evening, fatigue set in. He could no longer control his\r\ntelepathy. But he was accustomed to that--his untutored talent always\r\nran wild after several hours. Kaleidoscopic waves of thought assailed\r\nhis mind, jabbing at his senses until his head rang with a thousand\r\npulses.\r\n\r\nPain throbbed in his temples and at the base of his skull. Over and\r\nover, agonizing shafts of pain shot up to the top of his head until\r\nthe very hairs on his scalp ached. He clenched his fists and steeled\r\nhimself to endure the affliction in silence.\r\n\r\nAbruptly, the torment ended. He felt empty. His tensed body sagged for\r\nan instant and when he opened his eyes everyone had gone. The rooms\r\nwere still and dark except for the thin, barely visible filament of\r\nlight that seeped under the closed door of Blanding’s private office.\r\n\r\nBrandt relaxed in the soothing quiet. Faint murmurings came to him from\r\nthe busy street below, but they were like gentle lullabies in contrast\r\nto the telepathic noise he had just endured.\r\n\r\nPresently, Blanding emerged from his office. “Are you ready, Neville?”\r\nhe asked.\r\n\r\nEllen stood quietly at his side. Her eyes were compassionate and Brandt\r\nsuddenly realized that she understood what untutored telepathy was\r\nlike. But was there _more_ than pity in her feelings for him? Brandt\r\nearnestly hoped so.\r\n\r\nHe followed them out of the building. The streets were still alive\r\nwith people, and the sounds of their thoughts began to creep into his\r\nmind. Direct and indirect, controlled and uncontrolled, meaningful and\r\nmeaningless, the thought sounds clashed tumultuously within him.\r\n\r\nHe stepped onto the sidewalk strip beside Blanding, while Ellen moved\r\nquickly to his other side.\r\n\r\n_Don’t go with them!_ A powerful, directed thought plunged through the\r\nnoise and echoed forcefully in his mind. _Don’t go with them!_\r\n\r\nBrandt felt the pressure of Ellen’s hand on his arm increase, ever so\r\nslightly. For the first time he heard, her mental voice speaking to him\r\ndirectly. _Neville. Trust me. You must trust me_.\r\n\r\n_Don’t go!_ came the warning voice. _They’re government people!_\r\n\r\n“Spotters!” Ellen’s voice was suddenly frightened, unsure. “We will\r\nhave to hurry.”· She shuddered and urged him along the walk.\r\n\r\n“But that man is a telepath,” Brandt objected.\r\n\r\n“Of course,” Blanding said. “All government spotters are telepaths. How\r\nelse could they find their quarry?”\r\n\r\nAbruptly a searing, wide-open blast of hate, fear and anger washed over\r\nBrandt. So intense was it that he staggered from the shock. Instantly\r\nEllen put her arm about his waist to steady him. As he leaned heavily\r\nagainst her he dimly heard from a far-off cavern of echoes, the sound\r\nof voices.\r\n\r\n“The fool!” Blanding shouted. “Doesn’t he realize that Brandt can’t\r\nshield himself? Does he _want_ to kill him?”\r\n\r\n“You know how ruthless they are,” Ellen said. “They’d do _anything_ to\r\nprevent us from adding to our strength. Come on,” she urged. “We’ve got\r\nto get him away from here!”\r\n\r\nThe hate impulses poured in upon Brandt again and again. Mechanically,\r\nunconsciously, he allowed Ellen to steer him along the walk to the\r\nNorth Terminal. Her warmth and sympathetic nearness gave him partial\r\nshelter from the raging storm of powerful emotion that was driving down\r\nupon him like a slashing torrent.\r\n\r\n“Get in!” Blanding ordered, holding open the door of a cab. He obeyed\r\nmechanically. Ellen climbed in beside him, and Blanding followed. As\r\nsoon as they were seated, Blanding worked the throttle and they took\r\noff.\r\n\r\nAs they sped away from the city, the turmoil in Brandt’s mind grew less\r\nacute. Full consciousness returned and he was aware of the tumultuous\r\nand conflicting impulses that still lingered, subdued under the\r\nblanketing balm of empathy he felt coming from Ellen.\r\n\r\nHe looked out through the window of the helojet. The night-black\r\ncountryside was dotted with thousands of tiny lights--the suburban\r\nhomes of the city workers. The lights wheeled and dipped and air-marker\r\nlamps traced out a huge figure nine and an arrow pointing northward\r\ntoward the spaceport nine hundred miles away. Directly south of the\r\nmarker patterns lay the immense blackness of the empty city.\r\n\r\nBrandt turned to Blanding. “Where--where are we going?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“I told you. We’re taking you to join the others.”\r\n\r\n“But _where?_”\r\n\r\nBlanding smiled. “There’s no harm telling you now,” he said. “We’re\r\ntaking you to the Asylum. You’ll join the other thousands of telepaths\r\nwe’ve taken into custody. You’ll be safe there. Safety for you\r\nand--safety for the government.”\r\n\r\nBrandt shouted. “Then that man was right!” He twisted around, in\r\nsudden, unbelieving horror. “You _are_ from the government.” His\r\nmuscles tensed for an instant as he leaned toward Blanding. Then he\r\nhesitated, puzzlement spreading across his face.\r\n\r\n_Trust me, Neville!_\r\n\r\nBlanding laughed. “That’s all right, Ellen. He’s a big boy now. You\r\ncan drop the act.” He sneered at Brandt. “That’s right, Neville. We’re\r\nspotters. There are two kinds of telepaths, you see--idealistic fools\r\nlike you and government spotters like us. The idealists end up behind\r\nthe bars of the Asylums.”\r\n\r\nBrandt stared incredulously at the man he had worked with and trusted\r\ncompletely. He was like a different man now. He seemed to exude\r\narrogance and contempt.\r\n\r\nBrandt brought his fist up, hard. Blanding rolled back against the\r\nseat. The jet pitched convulsively. Again and again Brandt struck out\r\nblindly, his punches going wild.\r\n\r\nEllen struggled with the controls, bringing the cab level just as\r\nBlanding slashed out viciously with the edge of his hand. The blow\r\ncaught Brandt in the back of the neck and he slumped forward.\r\n\r\n“You fool,” Blanding taunted. “You could have become one of _us!_ But\r\nyou just didn’t have it in you! We probed you very thoroughly.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe glared down at Brandt struggling to rise. “Frankly, I had hoped to\r\nbe able to recruit you for the Service--it would have been a feather\r\nin my cap. But you’re an idealist!” He spoke the word with a grimace\r\nof contempt. “You’re one of those fools who subconsciously believe the\r\ndrivel concocted for the masses. Equality! Liberty! You can understand\r\nwhy we can’t allow people like you to remain at liberty. We can’t\r\nafford to have too many ‘enlightened’ people in the unenlightened\r\nmasses.”\r\n\r\n“He knows now,” Ellen protested. “Leave him alone.”\r\n\r\n“It’s never over with his kind.” Brandt shook his head to clear it, his\r\neyes defiant. “I don’t give a damn about--”\r\n\r\n“Save it, Neville!” Blanding warned. “It won’t do any good. We know you\r\nbetter than you know yourself.”\r\n\r\nThe helojet dipped and glided in to a landing at a brightly lighted\r\nfield. The landing lamps made a circle of blazing blossoms in the\r\nnight. The jet settled within the ring and rested like a huge butterfly\r\namidst a bed of tiger lilies.\r\n\r\n“This is it,” said Blanding.\r\n\r\nHe opened the door of the jet and hopped to the ground. Brandt followed\r\nhim. Ellen came up to him and took his hand. He felt her fingers\r\nsqueeze his.\r\n\r\n“You seem confused, Neville,” Blanding observed with a laugh. “Is there\r\nsomething you still don’t understand?”\r\n\r\nBrandt pulled his hand away. “Let’s get this over with!” he said\r\nangrily.\r\n\r\nThey walked down a long ramp toward a small circular stone building.\r\nThere was no courtyard and no fences. High in the walls of the pill-box\r\nbuilding were narrow windows in two rows--one at the third and one at\r\nthe fourth level. The windows of each level alternated with those above\r\nand below in a checkerboard pattern that ringed the entire structure.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the ramp they were halted by a thick block-glass door. As\r\nthey stood waiting a yellow light flashed on above them, and the door\r\nsuddenly became transparent. They faced a battery of deadly iota-ray\r\nsprayers.\r\n\r\n“Speak one, and identify yourself!” a metallic voice demanded.\r\n\r\n“Spotters seventeen and two-sixty-three,” Blanding said. “_And_\r\nprisoner.”\r\n\r\nThe light blinked, changing from yellow to blue, and the door slowly\r\nswung open. Blanding prodded Brandt and the latter moved forward into a\r\nsmall rotunda. He had a fleeting impression that Ellen’s hand touched\r\nhis once, and then....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was a cold, unfriendly room, and Brandt lay on his back on a hard\r\nmetal cot. His temples were pounding as he stared up at a three-quarter\r\nmoon that peered in through a high-silled window. Moonlight glowed\r\neerily in the small cubicle, painting the close gray walls with its\r\nsoft light.\r\n\r\nFor a chilling moment, Brandt did not know where he was. It was like\r\nwaking from a bad dream. His pulses throbbed, and he was covered with\r\nthe cold dampness of fright. Even his limbs seemed pinioned by an\r\nintolerable weight.\r\n\r\nThen he remembered--up to a point--and an even colder dread of reality\r\nsettled over him. He was a criminal! When every pretense had been set\r\naside--he was a criminal locked up in a prison. There was no escaping\r\nthe fact.\r\n\r\nHe was a telepath, and Blanding and Ellen were telepaths, too. But a\r\ndark, cruel gulf yawned between them. The door to his cell slid open\r\nnoisily and a self-propelled wheel chair rolled in.\r\n\r\n“Prisoner will report to R and C at once!” The metallic voice seemed to\r\ncome from everywhere.\r\n\r\nBrandt got off the cot and moved quickly toward the door. The chair\r\nrolled in front of him. He stopped and stared at this strange guard on\r\nwheels. Then he calmly seated himself. The chair promptly turned about,\r\nand moved out into the corridor. The corridor seemed endless. Around\r\nand around it stretched on either side of him. The chair turned to the\r\nright.\r\n\r\nREGISTRATION & CLASSIFICATION\r\n\r\nThe sign hung above a door before which the chair had stopped. Brandt\r\ngot off and opened the door. He tripped on the smooth metal bar which\r\nwas stretched across the doorway, and fell against a tilted examining\r\ntable. Instantly the table swung to horizontal and slid forward,\r\ncarrying Brandt into a domed chamber equipped with weird instruments.\r\nBands of nylon swiftly bound him motionless to the table.\r\n\r\nAn instrument, shining and ominous, lowered toward him. At its tip\r\na needle slid out of its rubber shield. Brandt strained desperately\r\nagainst the bonds. The syringe lowered to his arm, and paused while a\r\ncorrection in angle was made. Then it plunged into his flesh. Brandt\r\ngasped. The room spun wildly and a blackness settled over him.\r\n\r\nWhen he awoke, he was in another cubicle--bare except for a chrome\r\ntable. The nylon bands hung limply across him. He pushed them away and\r\nsat up. A light splashed on the table. On it were two badges. One had\r\nthe number TP-07403 stamped on it. The other read “Observation.”\r\n\r\n“Pin them on,” the voice said. “Number on left breast, classification\r\non right.”\r\n\r\nBrandt picked up the badges and began to fasten them on his shirt, his\r\nhand shaking a little.\r\n\r\n“You must wear identification tags at all times,” warned the voice.\r\n“Prisoner will report to orientation.”\r\n\r\nBrandt looked about for a door. There was none.\r\n\r\n“Get back on the table!” the voice ordered. Brandt obeyed and the table\r\ncarried him into yet another room.\r\n\r\n“Identify yourself!” the metal voice commanded.\r\n\r\n“Neville Brandt.”\r\n\r\n“Identify yourself more explicitly--as a prisoner.”\r\n\r\nHe fumbled at the badge on his shirt, twisting it so that he could read\r\nthe number.\r\n\r\n“TP-07403,” the voice said, “you are now under the jurisdiction of the\r\nTelepathic Control Board. As a latent telepath, you will be kept under\r\nconstant observation until such time as your sympathies and ultimate\r\ndevelopment can be determined. At that time you will be re-classified\r\ninto one of two major groups--Serviceable or Unserviceable. If you are\r\nsuitable, you will be inducted into the government service. If not, you\r\nwill be dealt with accordingly.\r\n\r\n“As a loyal citizen, you can readily understand that our policy is\r\nin the interest of national welfare, and we know that you will give\r\nus your full cooperation throughout your observation period. Failure\r\nto do so will, of course, lead to your immediate classification as\r\nUnserviceable. Prisoner will now--”\r\n\r\nThe voice was abruptly interrupted by a grating sound which reminded\r\nNeville of a scratchy recording.\r\n\r\n_Neville!_ The impulse swept over him suddenly, clearly, unexpectedly.\r\n_Listen to me carefully! This is Ellen. Trust me, darling. You must\r\ntrust me. Follow these directions and I’ll explain later_. Brandt\r\nfell back against the cold wall as the thoughts pressed in on him.\r\n_Go through the door and down the corridor to your left. Take the\r\nthird door on the right-hand side of the corridor, then follow the\r\nstairs--hurry! Hurry, Neville!_\r\n\r\nBrandt hesitated.\r\n\r\n_Please, Neville!_\r\n\r\nHe pushed through the door and ran down the corridor to the stairs.\r\nHe could not understand Ellen’s dual behavior, but he put the thought\r\nout of his mind. He had nothing to lose by trusting her implicitly. He\r\nbounded down the stairs and fell against a door. It flew open under his\r\nweight.\r\n\r\nThe room was filled with banks of cybernetic controls--and was quite\r\nobviously the nerve center of the automatic building! Ellen was moving\r\nslowly around a long narrow table that contained the voice units of the\r\nhuge robot prison. Blanding stood in tight-lipped silence at the far\r\nend of the table!\r\n\r\nBrandt threw himself at Blanding. They fell to the floor, struggling\r\nfuriously. Almost instantly, Blanding was in telepathic command.\r\nParalyzing pain seized Brandt and rocked him back against the table.\r\nBlanding clambered to his feet, his face contorted with rage. He rushed\r\nat Brandt, catching him in the pit of the stomach with his fist.\r\n\r\nThe blow sucked the blood from Brandt’s head and his mind cleared a\r\nlittle. He struck back blindly and felt Blanding stagger backwards. He\r\nlunged after the falling man, sprawling on top of him, and pounded his\r\nhead against the stone floor. Blanding’s body relaxed and he stopped\r\nstruggling.\r\n\r\nBrandt got shakily to his feet. Ellen rushed to him. He took her into\r\nhis arms, and held her tightly.\r\n\r\n“It’s all right,” he comforted her. “It’s all right.” He waited until\r\nshe had stopped sobbing before he asked, “How do we get out of here?”\r\n\r\n“We must release the others first,” Ellen said. “We’ve got a few\r\nminutes before the police can figure out what’s happened.”\r\n\r\n“How many are there here?”\r\n\r\n“About two hundred,” she told him. “And there are thousands more\r\nscattered throughout the country in other places like this.”\r\n\r\n“What about _them!_” Brandt demanded.\r\n\r\nEllen pointed to the complex machinery in the room. “These controls can\r\nbe activated to open every cell in the country.”\r\n\r\nBrandt examined the machinery. It was similar to the cybernetic brain\r\nhe had developed at Central Metals to control the quality regulators in\r\nall the factories at the same time.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he was smiling. “Then you planned this whole thing!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Neville. Even the man who almost killed you with his concentrated\r\nthoughts this evening. He was planted there for Blanding’s benefit.”\r\n\r\n“But why did you wait this long? Why not two years ago when my\r\ntelepathy began?”\r\n\r\n“That’s when our planning began,” Ellen said. “When I was certain that\r\nyou were telepathic, I told our leaders about you. They decided that\r\nyou were the only one who could set the dials on the ‘Brain’ properly,\r\nand we had to let them get you in here. It wasn’t easy to stand by and\r\nwait while Blanding watched you compile your notebook.\r\n\r\n“This book,” Ellen continued, reaching into her purse, “could have\r\nbeen a valuable tool against us. It pinpoints every stage and system\r\nof telepathic development. Blanding wanted it as complete as possible\r\nbefore moving against you. Now we’ll use it to help train our people.”\r\n\r\n“Then you knew how I felt about you all along,” Brandt whispered.\r\n\r\n“I knew--and I feared for you each day. I wanted to tell you who I\r\nreally was a thousand times--to tell you I loved you.
