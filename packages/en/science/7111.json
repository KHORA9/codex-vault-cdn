During the four months\r\nbetween December 19, 1877, and April 20, 1878, the officers\r\nemployed covered some 2500 miles by sea and land, of which 600,\r\nnot including by-paths, were mapped and planned; and we brought\r\nback details of an old-new land which the civilized world had\r\nclean forgotten.\r\n\r\nThe public will now understand that one and the same subject has\r\nnot given rise to two books. I have to acknowledge with gratitude\r\nthe many able and kindly notices by the Press of my first volume\r\n(\"The Gold Mines of Midian,\" etc. Messrs. C. Kegan Paul & Co.,\r\n1878). But some reviewers succeeded in completely\r\nmisunderstanding the drift of that avant courier. It was an\r\nintroduction intended to serve as a base for the present more\r\nextensive work, and--foundations intended to bear weight must be\r\nsolid. Its object was to place before the reader the broad\r\noutlines of a country whose name was known to \"every schoolboy,\"\r\nwhilst it was a vox et praeterea nihil, even to the learned,\r\nbefore the spring of 1877. I had judged advisable to sketch, with\r\nthe able assistance of learned friends, its history and\r\ngeography; its ethnology and archaeology; its zoology and\r\nmalacology; its botany and geology. The drift was to prepare\r\nthose who take an interest in Arabia generally, and especially in\r\nwild mysterious Midian, for the present work, which, one foresaw,\r\nwould be a tale of discovery and adventure. Thus readers of \"The\r\nLand of Midian (Revisited)\" may feel that they are not standing\r\nupon ground utterly unknown; and the second publication is\r\nshortened and lightened--perhaps the greatest advantage of\r\nall--by the prolegomena having been presented in the first.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the last Expedition was to conclude the labours\r\nbegun, during the spring of 1877, in a mining country unknown, or\r\nrather, fallen into oblivion. Hence its primary \"objective\" was\r\nmineralogical. The twenty-five tons of specimens, brought back to\r\nCairo, were inspected by good judges from South Africa,\r\nAustralia, and California; and all recognized familiar\r\nmetalliferous rocks. The collection enabled me to distribute the\r\nmining industry into two great branches--(1) the rich silicates\r\nand carbonates of copper smelted by the Ancients in North Midian;\r\nand (2) the auriferous veins worked, but not worked out, by\r\ncomparatively modern races in South Midian, the region lying\r\nbelow the parallel of El-Muwaylah. It is, indeed, still my\r\nconviction that \"tailings\" have been washed for gold, even by men\r\nstill living. We also brought notices and specimens of three\r\nseveral deposits of sulphur; of a turquoise-mine behind Ziba; of\r\nsalt and saltpetre, and of vast deposits of gypsum. These are\r\nsources of wealth which the nineteenth century is not likely to\r\nleave wasted and unworked.\r\n\r\nIn geography the principal novelties are the identification of\r\ncertain ruined cities mentioned by Ptolemy, and the \"Harrahs\" or\r\nplutonic centres scattered over the seaboard and the interior. I\r\nventure to solicit the attention of experts for my notes on\r\nEl-Harrah, that great volcanic chain whose fair proportions have\r\nbeen so much mutilated by its only explorer, the late Dr. Wallin.\r\nBeginning with Damascan Trachonitis, and situated, in the\r\nparallel of north lat. 28 degrees, about sixty direct miles east\r\nof the Red Sea, it is reported to subtend the whole coast of\r\nNorth-Western Arabia, between El-Muwaylah (north lat. 27 degrees\r\n39') and El-Yambu' (north lat. 24 degrees 5'). Equally noticeable\r\nare the items of information concerning the Wady Hamz, the\r\n\"Land's End\" of Egypt, and the most important feature of its kind\r\nin North-Western Arabia. Its name, wrongly given by Wallin, is\r\nunknown to the Hydrographic Chart, and to the erudite pages of my\r\nfriend Professor Aloys Sprenger, who, however, suspects with me\r\nthat it may be the mouth of the celebrated Wady el-Kura. For\r\nfurther topographical details the reader is referred to the\r\n\"Itineraries\" of the Expedition, offered to the Royal\r\nGeographical Society of London.\r\n\r\nSome of the principal sites were astronomically determined by\r\nCommanders Ahmed Musallam and Nasir Ahmed, of the Egyptian navy.\r\nThe task of mapping and planning was committed to the two young\r\nStaff-lieutenants sent for that purpose. They worked well in the\r\nfield; and their sketches were carefully executed whilst under my\r\nsuperintendence. But it was different when they returned to\r\nCairo. The maps sent to the little Exposition at the Hippo-drome\r\n(see conclusion) were simply a disgrace to the Staff-bureau. My\r\ndeparture from Egypt caused delay; and, when the chart reached\r\nme, it was far from satisfactory: names had been omitted, and\r\nwithout my presence it could not have been printed. With the able\r\nassistance of Mr. William J. Turner, of the Royal Geographical\r\nSociety, who found the work harder than he expected, it has been\r\nreduced to tolerable shape. Still, it is purely provisional; and,\r\nwhen mining operations shall begin, a far more careful survey\r\nwill be required.\r\n\r\nAs regards archaeology, the second Expedition visited, described,\r\nand surveyed eighteen ruins of cities and towns, some of\r\nconsiderable extent, in North Midian, besides seeing or hearing\r\nof some twenty large Mashghal, apparently the ateliers of vagrant\r\nGypsy-like gangs. This total of thirty-eight is not far short of\r\nthe forty traditional Midianite settlements preserved by the\r\nmediaeval Arab geographers. Many others are reported to exist in\r\nthe central or inland region; and fifteen were added by the South\r\nCountry, including the classical temple or shrine, found upon the\r\nbank of the Wady Hamz before mentioned. The most interesting\r\nsites were recommended to M. Lacaze, whose portfolio was soon\r\nfilled with about two hundred illustrations, in oil and\r\nwater-colours, pencil croquis and \"sun-pictures.\" All, except the\r\nsix coloured illustrations which adorn this volume, have been\r\nleft in Egypt. His Highness resolved to embody the results of our\r\njoint labours in a large album, illustrated with coloured\r\nlithographs, maps, and plans, explained by letter-press, and\r\nprepared at the Citadel, Cairo.\r\n\r\nThe Meteorological Journal was kept by myself, assisted at times\r\nby Mr. Clarke. Mr. David Duguid, engineer of the Mukhbir, whose\r\ngallant conduct will be recorded (Chap. VIII.), and Commander\r\nNasir Ahmed, of the Sinnar, obliged me by registering\r\nsimultaneous observations at sea-level. The whole was reduced to\r\nshape by Mr. W. J. Turner, of the Royal Geographical Society.\r\n\r\nMy private collection of mineralogical specimens was deposited\r\nwith Professor M. H. N. Story-Maskelyne. The spirit-specimens of\r\nzoology filled three large canisters: and the British Museum also\r\nreceived a hare and five birds (Mr. R. B. Sharpe); four bats\r\n(Rhinopoma) and a mouse; six reptiles, five fishes, thirty-five\r\ncrustaceans, and about the same number of insects; five\r\nscorpions, six leeches, sixty molluscs, four echinoderms, and\r\nthree sponges. Dr. A. Gunther (Appendix III.) determined and\r\nnamed two new species of reptiles. Mr. Frederick Smith (Appendix\r\nIII.) took charge of the insects. Mr. Edward J. Miers, F. L.S.,\r\netc., described the small collection of crustaceae (Annals and\r\nMagazine of Natural History for November, 1878). Finally, Edgar\r\nA. Smith examined and named the shells collected on the shores of\r\nthe 'Akabah Gulf and the north-eastern recess of the Red Sea.\r\n\r\nThe main interest of the little hortus siccus was the Alpine\r\nFlora, gathered at an altitude of five thousand feet above\r\nsea-level. The plants were offered to Sir Joseph Dalton Hooker,\r\nof Kew; and Professor D. Oliver, of the Herbarium, has kindly\r\nfurnished me with a list of the names (Appendix IV.). Mr. William\r\nCarruthers and his staff also examined the spirit-specimens of\r\nfleshy plants (Appendix IV.).\r\n\r\nMr. Reginald Stuart Poole, Keeper of Coins and Medals, and Mr.\r\nBarclay V. Head were good enough to compare with their rich\r\ncollections the coins of ancient Midian found (Chap. III.), for\r\nthe first time, at Maghair Shu'ayb[EN#1]. Some years ago, Mr.\r\nRobert Ready, of the British Museum, had bought from a Jew, Yusuf\r\nKalafat (?), a miscellaneous collection, which included about\r\nsixty of the so-called Midianitic coins. But the place of\r\ndiscovery is wholly unknown. The Assistant Keeper read a paper\r\n\"On Arabian Imitations of Athenian Coins,\" Midianitic,\r\nHimyaritic, and others, at a meeting of the Numismatic Society\r\n(November 21, 1878); and I did the same at the Royal Asiatic\r\nSociety, December 16, 1878. The little \"find\" of stone\r\nimplements, rude and worked; and the instruments illustrating the\r\nmining industry of the country, appeared before the\r\nAnthropological Section of the British Association, which met at\r\nDublin (August, 1878), and again before the Anthropological\r\nInstitute of London, December 10, 1878.\r\n\r\nFinally, the skulls and fragments of skulls from Midian were\r\nsubmitted to Professor Richard Owen, the Superintendent of\r\nNatural History; and my learned friend kindly inspected the\r\nEgyptian and Palmyrene crania which accompanied them. The whole\r\nwas carefully described by Dr. C. Carter Blake, Ph.D., before the\r\nlast-named seance of the Anthropological Institute (December 10,\r\n1878).\r\n\r\nThe tons of specimens brought to Cairo were, I have said,\r\npublicly exhibited there, and created much interest. But the\r\ndiscovery of a mining-country, some three hundred miles long,\r\nonce immensely wealthy, and ready to become wealthy once more, is\r\nnot likely to be accepted by every one. Jealous and obstructive\r\nofficials \"did not think much of it.\" Rivals opposed it with even\r\nless ceremony. A mild \"ring\" in Egypt attempted in vain to run\r\nthe Hamamat and Dar-For mines (Chap. III.) against Midian.\r\nConsequently the local Press was dosed with rumours, which,\r\nretailed by the home papers, made the latter rife in\r\ncontradictory reports. To quote one case only. The\r\nturquoise-gangue from Ziba (Chap. XII.) was pronounced, by the\r\ninexpert mineralogists at the Citadel, Cairo, who attempted\r\ncriticism, to be carbonate of copper, because rich silicates of\r\nthat metal were shown at the Exposition. No one seemed to know\r\nthat the fine turquoises of Midian have been sold for years at\r\nSuez, and even at Cairo.\r\n\r\nThere was, indeed, much to criticise in the collection, which had\r\nbeen made with a marvellous carelessness. But we must not be hard\r\nupon M. Marie. He is an engineer, utterly ignorant of mineralogy\r\nand of assaying: he was told off to do the duty, and he did it as\r\nwell as he could--in other words, very badly. He neglected to\r\nsearch for alluvial gold in the sands. Every Wady which cuts, at\r\nright angles, the metalliferous maritime chains, should have been\r\ncarefully prospected; these sandy and quartzose beds are natural\r\nconduits and sluice-boxes. But the search for \"tailings\" is\r\ncompletely different from that of gold-veins, and requires\r\nespecial practice. The process, indeed, may be called purely\r\nempirical. It is not taught in Jermyn Street, nor by the Ecole\r\ndes Mines. In this matter theory must bow to \"rule of thumb:\" the\r\ncaprices of alluvium are various and curious enough to baffle\r\nevery attempt at scientific induction. Thus the \"habits\" of the\r\nmetal, so to speak, must be studied by experiment with patient\r\nlabour, the most accomplished mineralogist may pass over rich\r\nalluvium without recognizing its presence, where the rude\r\nprospector of California and Australia will find an abundance of\r\nstream-gold. Evidently the proportion of \"tailings\" must\r\ncarefully be laid down before companies are justified in\r\nundertaking the expensive operation of quartz-crushing. Hence M.\r\nTiburce Morisot, a practical digger from South Africa, introduced\r\nat Cairo by his compatriot, M. Marie, to my friend M. Yacoub\r\nArtin Bey, found a fair opportunity of proposing to his Highness\r\nthe Khediv (October, 1878) a third Expedition in search of\r\nsand-gold. The Viceroy, however, true to his undertaking, refused\r\nto sanction any \"interloping.\"\r\n\r\nThe highly distinguished M. Ferdinand de Lesseps, when en route\r\nto Paris, kindly took charge of some cases of specimens for\r\nanalysis. But the poorest stuff had been supplied to him by M.\r\nMarie; and the results, of which I never heard, were probably\r\nnil. The samples brought to England, by order of his Highness the\r\nKhediv, were carefully assayed. The largest collection was\r\nsubmitted to Dr. John Percy, F.R.S. Smaller items were sent to\r\nthe well-known houses, Messrs. Johnston and Matthey, of Hatton\r\nGarden, and Messrs. Edgar Jackson and Co., Associates of the\r\nRoyal School of Mines (fourteen samples). Finally, special\r\nobservations were made by Mr. John L. Jenken, of Carrington,\r\nthrough Mr. J. H. Murchison, of \"British Lead Mines,\" etc., etc.,\r\netc.; by Lieut.-Colonel Ross, the distinguished author of\r\n\"Pyrology;\" and by Lieut.-Colonel Bolton, who kindly compared the\r\nrocks with those in his cabinet. M. Gastinel-Bey's analysis of\r\nthe specimens brought home by the first Expedition will be found\r\nat the end of Chap. VIII.\r\n\r\nThe following is the text of Dr. Percy's report:--\r\n\r\nMetallurgical Laboratory, Royal School of Mines,\r\nJermyn Street, London Dec 13 1878.\r\n\r\nDear Sir,\r\n\r\nI now send the results of the analytical examination of the specimens\r\nwhich you submitted to me for that purpose. The examination has been\r\nconducted with the greatest care, in the metallurgical laboratory of the\r\nRoyal School of Mines, by Mr. Richard Smith, who, for the last thirty\r\nyears, has been constantly engaged in such work; and in whose accuracy I\r\nhave absolute confidence. It is impossible that any one should have taken\r\ngreater interest in, or have devoted himself with greater earnestness to,\r\nthe investigation. I have almost entirely confined myself to a statement\r\nof facts, as I understand that was all you required for the guidance of\r\nhis Highness the Khedive.\r\n\r\n                           Section 1.\r\n\r\nExamination of the mineral specimens contained in the boxes marked as\r\nunder.\r\n\r\n(An average representative sample of each specimen, of about six pounds\r\nin weight, was prepared for examination from portions broken off, or\r\notherwise taken, by Mr. Richard Smith at the Victoria Docks.[EN#2]\r\n\r\nNo. 1. \"Box 22,\" Quartz from Mugnah (Makna).

The\r\nfractured surface was red, with patches of yellow. It was found to\r\nconsist chiefly of silica, coloured with oxides of iron.\r\n\r\nNo. 28. \"H.\" Lump of \"sard,\" of a pale-red flesh colour. A variety of\r\nchalcedony. It was found to consist almost entirely of silica[EN#8].\r\n\r\nNo. 29. \"I.\" Lumps of pure ironstone.\r\n\r\nA small lump of metal[EN#9], supposed to contain antimony[EN#10] and\r\nplatinum, was brought for examination by Captain R. F. Burton. It was\r\nsubmitted to analysis, and found to be iron and combined carbon, or white\r\ncast-iron, containing small quantities of lead, copper, and silver, and\r\nfree from antimony, platinum, and gold. It is evidently the product of a\r\nfusion operation. A few \"shots\" of lead were attached to the surface of\r\nthe metal[EN#11].\r\n\r\nDr. Percy concludes the assays in these words:--\r\n\r\nThree of the specimens (Nos. 14, 15, and 19) from the same\r\nlocality contain gold. The amount of gold, however, is small. I\r\nconsider these indications of the presence of the precious metal\r\nnot altogether unsatisfactory; and certainly to justify further\r\nexploration. My conviction is, that the ancients were adepts in\r\nthe art of extracting gold, and that, owing to the small value of\r\nhuman labour, they could get out as much of the metal as could\r\nnow be done. They knew perfectly what was worth working and what\r\nwas not; and I think it likely that what you have brought home,\r\nhad been rejected by the ancients as unworkable[EN#12]. Further\r\nsearch may lead to the discovery of workable stuff; but would\r\ndoubtless require a good deal of time, unless lucky accident\r\nshould intervene.\r\n\r\nThe specimens Nos. 2, 3, 5, 22, and 23 contain sufficient iron to\r\nrender them available as iron ores, provided they occur in large\r\nquantity. The copper present in No. 21a is too small in amount to\r\nrender it available as a source of that metal [Footnote: Analyses\r\nof copper ore from Midian at the Citadel, Cairo, gave in certain\r\ncases forty percent.]. If it is practicable on a large scale, by\r\nhand-labour or other means, to separate the \"copper mineral\" (as\r\nin b), it would be sufficiently rich in copper, provided the cost\r\nof the transit were not too great.\r\n\r\nThe specimen No. 17 is only of scientific interest, as it gives\r\noff an acid vapour when heated; and this substance may have been\r\nused by the ancients in the separation of silver from gold by the\r\nprocess termed \"cementation.\"\r\n\r\nI remain, dear Sir, yours very truly,\r\n\r\n(Signed)  JOHN PERCY, M.D., F.R.S.\r\nLecturer on Metallurgy at the Royal School of Mines, London.\r\n\r\nCapt. R. F. Burton, etc.\r\n\r\nUpon this able report I would offer the following observations.\r\nWe, who have travelled through a country like Midian, finding\r\neverywhere extensive works for metallurgy; barrages and\r\naqueducts, cisterns and tanks ; furnaces, fire-bricks, and\r\nscoriae; open mines, and huge scatters of spalled quartz, with\r\nthe remains of some eighteen cities and towns which apparently\r\nfell to ruin with the industry that founded and fed them;--we, I\r\nsay, cannot but form a different and a far higher idea of its\r\nmineral capabilities than those who determine them by the simple\r\ninspection of a few specimens. The learned Dr. Percy at once hits\r\nthe mark when he surmises that worthless samples were brought\r\nhome; and this would necessarily occur when no metallurgist, no\r\npractical prospector, was present with the Expedition. As will\r\nappear from the following pages, all the specimens were collected\r\na ciel ouvert, and wholly without judgment.\r\n\r\nI therefore expect that future exploration will develop Midian as\r\nit has done India. The quartzose outcrop called the \"Wynaad reef\"\r\n(Madras Presidency) produced only a few poor penny-weights per\r\nton, two and seven being the extremes, while much of it was\r\npractically unproductive. Presently, in February, 1878, the\r\ndistrict was visited by Sir Andrew Clarke, of Australian\r\nexperience, member of the Viceregal Council. He invited Mr.\r\nBrough Smyth, of Victoria, to explore and test the capabilities\r\nof the country; and that eminent practical engineer discovered,\r\nin an area of twenty-five by thirteen miles, ninety outcrops,\r\nsome yielding, they say, two hundred ounces per ton of gold, fine\r\nand coarse, \"with jagged pieces as large as peas.\" And British\r\nIndia now hopes to draw her gold coinage from Wynaad.\r\n\r\nI conclude this abstract of the book, which would have been\r\nreduced in size had the mass of matter permitted, with the\r\nheartfelt hope that the grand old Land of Midian will not be\r\nwithout attraction to the public of Europe.\r\n\r\nRICHARD F.

The Golden Region appeared to me in the glow\r\nof primaeval prosperity described by the Egyptian hieroglyphs; as\r\nrich in agriculture and in fertility, according to the old\r\nHellenic travellers, as in its Centres of civilization, and in\r\nthe precious metals catalogued by the Sacred Books of the\r\nHebrews. Again I saw the mining works of the Greek, the Roman,\r\nand the Nabathæan, whose names are preserved by Ptolemy; the\r\nforty cities, mere ghosts and shadows of their former selves,\r\ndescribed in the pages of the mediaeval Arab geographers; and the\r\nruthless ruin which, under the dominion of the Bedawin, gradually\r\ncrept over the Land of Jethro. The tale of her rise and fall\r\nforcibly suggested Algeria, that province so opulent and splendid\r\nunder the Masters of the World; converted into a fiery wilderness\r\nby the representatives of the \"gentle and gallant\" Turk, and\r\nbrought to life once more by French energy and industry. And such\r\nwas my vision of a future Midian, whose rich stores of various\r\nminerals will restore to her wealth and health, when the two\r\nKhedivial Expeditions shall have shown the world what she has\r\nbeen, and what she may be again.\r\n\r\nI was invited to resume my exploration during the winter of\r\n1877-78, by the Viceroy of Egypt, Ismail I., a prince whose\r\nsuperior intelligence is ever anxious to develop the resources of\r\nhis country. His Highness was perhaps the only man in his own\r\ndominions who, believing in the buried wealth of Midian, had the\r\nperspicacity to note the advantages offered by its exploitation.\r\nFor the world around the Viceroy pronounced itself decidedly\r\nagainst the project. My venerable friend, Linant Pasha, suggested\r\na comparison with the abandoned diggings of the Upper Nile;\r\nforgetting that in at least half of Midian land, only the\r\n\"tailings\" have been washed: whereas in the Bishárí country, and\r\nthroughout the \"Etbaye,\" between the meridians of Berenike and\r\nSawákín, the very thinnest metallic fibrils have been shafted and\r\ntunnelled to their end in the rock by those marvellous labourers,\r\nthe old Egyptians. In the Hamámát country, again, the excessive\r\ndistances, both from the Nile and from the Red Sea, together with\r\nthe cost of transport, must bar all profit. Even worse are the\r\nconditions of Fayzoghlú and Dár-For; whilst the mines of Midian\r\nbegin literally at the shore.\r\n\r\nAnother Pasha wrote to me from Alexandria, congratulating me upon\r\nhaving discovered, during our first Expedition, \"a little copper\r\nand iron.\" Generally, the official public, knowing that I had\r\nbrought back stones, not solid masses of gold and silver, loudly\r\ndeplored the prospective waste of money; and money, after the\r\nhorse-plague, the low Nile, and the excessive exigencies of the\r\nshort-sighted creditor, was exceptionally scarce. The truly\r\nOriental view of the question was taken by an official, whom I\r\nshall call Árif Pasha--the \"Knowing One.\" When told that M.\r\nGeorge Marie, the Government engineer detailed to accompany the\r\nfirst Expedition, had sent in official analyses with sample tubes\r\nof gold and silver, thus establishing the presence of auriferous\r\nand argentiferous rocks on the Arabian shore, Son Excellence\r\nexclaimed, \"Imprudent jeune homme, thus to throw away the chances\r\nof life! Had he only declared the whole affair a farce, a flam, a\r\nsell, a canard, the Viceroy would have held him to be honest, and\r\nwould have taken care of his future.\"\r\n\r\nStill, through bad report the Khediv, who had mastered, with his\r\nusual accuracy of perception and judgment, the subject of Midian\r\nand her Mines, was staunch to his resolve; and when one of his\r\nEuropean financiers, a Controleur Général de Dépenses, the normal\r\nround peg in the square hole, warned him that there were no\r\npublic funds for such purpose, his Highness warmly declared, on\r\ndit, that the costs of the Expedition should be defrayed at his\r\nown expense.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile I had passed the summer of 1877 in preparation for the\r\nwork of the ensuing winter. A long correspondence with many\r\nlearned friends, and a sedulous study of the latest geographers,\r\nespecially German, taught me all that was known of mining in\r\nArabia generally, and particularly in Midian. During my six\r\nmonths' absence from Egypt my vision was fixed steadily upon one\r\npoint, the Expedition that was to come; and when his Highness was\r\npleased to offer me, in an autograph letter full of the kindest\r\nexpressions, the government of Dár-For, I deferred accepting the\r\nhonour till Midian had been disposed of.\r\n\r\nUnhappily, certain kindly advisers persuaded me to make well\r\nbetter by a visit to Karlsbad, and a course of its alkaline\r\n\"Fountains of Health.\" Never was there a greater mistake! The air\r\nis bad as the water is good; the climate is reeking damp, like\r\nthat of Western Africa; and, as in St. Petersburg, a plaid must\r\nbe carried during the finest weather. Its effects, rheumatic and\r\nneuralgic, may be judged by the fact that the doctors must walk\r\nabout with pocketed squirts, for the hypodermal injection of\r\nopium. Almost all those whom I knew there, wanting to be better,\r\nwent away worse; and, in my own case, a whole month of Midian\r\nsun, and a sharp attack of ague and fever were required to burn\r\nout the Hexenschuss and to counteract the deleterious effects of\r\nthe \"Hygeian springs.\"\r\n\r\nAt last the happy hour for departure struck; and on October 19,\r\n1877, the Austro-Hungarian Espero (Capitano Colombo) steamed out\r\nof Trieste. On board were Sefer Pasha, our host of Castle\r\nBertoldstein; and my learned friends, the Aulic Councillor Alfred\r\nvon Kremer, Austrian Commissioner to Egypt, and Dr. Heinrich\r\nBrugsch-Bey. The latter gave me a tough piece of work in the\r\nshape of his \"Ægypten,\" which will presently be quoted in these\r\npages. It would be vain to repeat a description of the little\r\nvoyage described in \"The Gold-Mines of Midian.\" The Dalmatian, or\r\nfirst day; the second, or day of Corfu loved and lost; and the\r\nthird, made memorable by Cephalonia and the glorious Canale, all\r\ngave fine smooth weather. But the usual rolling began off\r\nstill-vexed Cape Matapan. It lasted through the fourth day, or of\r\nCandia, this insula nobilis et amæna--\r\n\r\n\"Crete, the crown of all the isles, flower of Levantine waters\"\r\n\r\n--while the fifth, or Mediterraneo-Alexandrian day, killed two of\r\nthe seventeen fine horses, Yuckers and Anglo-Normans, which Sefer\r\nPasha was conveying to Cairo.\r\n\r\nOn Thursday morning (October 25), after rolling through the night\r\noff the old port Eunostus, which now looks brand-new, we landed,\r\nand the next day saw me at Cairo. Such was my haste that I could\r\npay only a flying visit to the broken beer-bottles, the burst\r\nprovision-tins, the ice-plants, and the hospitable society of\r\nRamleh the Sand-heap; and my many acquaintances had barely time\r\nto offer their congratulations upon the prospects of my \"becoming\r\nan Egyptian.\"\r\n\r\nMy presence at the capital was evidently necessary. A manner of\r\nassociation for utilizing the discoveries of the first Expedition\r\nhad been formed in London by the Messieurs Vignolles, who knew\r\nonly the scattered and unofficial notices; issued, without my\r\nprivity, by English and continental journals. Their\r\nrepresentative, General Nuthall, formerly of the Madras army, had\r\ntwice visited Cairo, in August and October, 1877, seeking a\r\nconcession of the mines, and offering conditions which were\r\nperfectly unacceptable. The Viceroy was to allow, contrary to\r\nconvention, the free importation of all machinery; to supply\r\nguards, who were not wanted; and, in fact, to guarantee the\r\nsafety of the workmen, who were perfectly safe. In return, ten\r\nper cent. on net profits, fifteen being the royalty of the Suez\r\nCanal, was the magnificent inducement offered to the viceregal\r\nconvoitise. I could not help noting, by no means silently, this\r\nnoble illustration of the principle embodied in Sic vos non\r\nvobis. I was to share in the common fate of originators,\r\ndiscoverers, and inventors: the find was mine, the profits were\r\nto go--elsewhere. General Nuthall professed inability to regard\r\nthe matter in that light; while to all others it appeared in no\r\nother. However, after a few friendly meetings, the representative\r\nleft Egypt, with the understanding that possibly we might work\r\ntogether when the exploration should have been completed. His\r\nHighness, who had verbally promised me either the concession or\r\nfour per cent. on gross produce, acted en prince, simply\r\nremarking that the affair was in my hands, and that he would not\r\ninterfere with me.\r\n\r\nI must not trouble the reader with the tedious tale of the pains\r\nand the labour which accompany the accouchement of such an\r\nExpedition. All practicals know that to organize a movement of\r\nsixty men is not less troublesome--indeed, rather more so--than\r\nif it numbered six hundred or six thousand. The Viceroy had\r\nwisely determined that we should not only carry out the work of\r\ndiscovery by tracing the precious metals to their source; but,\r\nalso, that we should bring back specimens weighing tons enough\r\nfor assay and analysis, quantitive and qualitive, in London and\r\nParis. Consequently, miners and mining apparatus were wanted,\r\nwith all the materials for quarrying and blasting: my spirit\r\nsighed for dynamite, but experiments at Trieste had shown it to\r\nbe too dangerous. The party was to consist of an escort numbering\r\ntwenty-five Súdán soldiers of the Line, negroes liberated some\r\ntwo years ago; a few Ma'danjiyyah (\"mine-men\"), and thirty\r\nHaggárah (\"stone-men\" or quarrymen).\r\n\r\nThe Government magazines of Cairo contain everything, but the\r\ndifficulty is to find where the dispersed articles are stored:\r\nthere is a something of red-tapeism; but all is plain sailing,\r\ncompared with what it would be in Europe. The express orders of\r\nhis Highness Husayn Kámil Pasha, Minister of Finance and Acting\r\nMinister of War, at once threw open every door. Had this young\r\nprince not taken in the affair a personal interest of the\r\nliveliest and most intelligent nature, we might have spent the\r\nwinter at Cairo. And here I cannot refrain from mentioning,\r\namongst other names, that of Mr. Alfred E. Garwood, C.E.,\r\nlocomotive superintendent; who, in the short space of four\r\nmonths, has introduced order and efficiency into the chaos known\r\nas the Bulák magazines. With his friendly cooperation, and under\r\nhis vigorous arm, difficulties melted away like hail in a\r\ntropical sun. General Stone (Pasha), the Chief of Staff, also\r\nrendered me some assistance, by lending the instruments which\r\nstood in his own cabinet de travail.[EN#13]\r\n\r\nPoor Cairo had spent a seedy autumn. The Russo-Turkish campaign,\r\nwhich had been unjustifiably allowed, by foreign Powers, to drain\r\nEgypt of her gold and life-blood--some 25,000 men since the\r\nbeginning of the Servian prelude--not only caused \"abundant\r\nsorrow\" to the capital, but also frightened off the stranger-host,\r\nwhich habitually supplies the poorer population with sovereigns\r\nand napoleons. The horse-pest, a bad typhus, after raging in 1876\r\nand early 1877, had died out: unfortunately, so had the horses;\r\nand the well-bred, fine-tempered, and high-spirited little\r\nEgyptians were replaced by a mongrel lot, hastily congregated\r\nfrom every breeding ground in Europe. The Fellahs, who had\r\nexpected great things from the mission of MM. Goschen and\r\nJoubert, asked wonderingly if those financiers had died; while a\r\nscanty Nile, ten to twelve feet lower, they say, than any known\r\nduring the last thousand years, added to the troubles of the\r\npoor, by throwing some 600,000 feddans (acres) out of gear, and\r\nby compelling an exodus from the droughty right to the left bank.\r\nFinally, when the river of Egypt did rise, it rose too late, and\r\nbrought with it a feverish and unwholesome autumn. Briefly, we\r\nhardly escaped the horrors of Europe--\r\n\r\n          \"Herbstesahnung! Triste Spuren\r\n          In den Wäldern, auf den Fluren!\r\n          Regentage, böses Wetter,\" etc.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in the Land of the Pharaohs, whose scanty interest\r\nabout the war was disguised by affected rejoicings at Ottoman\r\nsuccesses, the Prophet gallantly took the field, as in the days\r\nof Yúsuf bin Ishák. This time the vehicle of revelation was the\r\nlearned Shayhk (má? ) Alaysh, who was ordered in a dream by the\r\nApostle of Allah (upon whom be peace!) to announce the victory of\r\nthe Moslem over the Infidel; and, as the vision took place in\r\nJemádi el-Akhir (June), the first prediction was not more\r\nunsuccessful than usual. Shortly afterwards, the same reverend\r\nman again dreamt that, seeing two individuals violently\r\nquarreling, with voies de fait, he had hastened, like a true\r\nbeliever, to separate and to reconcile them. But what was his\r\nsurprise when the brawlers proved to be the Sultan and the Czar,\r\nthe former administering condign personal punishment to his\r\nhereditary foe. This, the enlightened Shaykh determined, was a\r\nsign that in September the Osmanli would be gloriously\r\ntriumphant. Nor was he far wrong. The Russians, who had begun the\r\ncampaign, like the English in India, with a happy contempt both\r\nfor the enemy and for the elementary rules of war, were struck\r\nwith a cold fit of caution: instead of marching straight upon and\r\nintrenching themselves in Adrianople, they vainly broke their\r\ngallant heads against the improvised earthworks of Plevna. And\r\nignorant Europe, marvelling at the prowess of the \"noble Turk,\"\r\nignored the fact that all the best \"Turkish\" soldiers were Slavs,\r\noriginally Christians, renegades of old, unable to speak a word\r\nof Turkish; preserving their Bosniac family-names, and without\r\none drop of Turkish blood in their veins. Sulayman Pashás army\r\nwas about as \"Turkish\" as are the Poles or the Hungarians.\r\n\r\nNot the less did Cairo develop the normal season-humours of the\r\nFrank. Among the various ways of \"doing the Pyramids,\" I\r\nregistered a new one: Mr. A---- , junior, unwilling wholly to\r\nneglect them, sent his valet with especial orders to stand upon\r\nthe topmost plateau. The \"second water\" of irrigation made\r\nNovember dangerous; many of the \"Shepheards\" suffered from the\r\nAyán el-Mulúk, the \"Evil of Kings\" (gout), in the gloomy form as\r\nwell as the gay; and whisky-cum-soda became popular as upon the\r\nbanks of the Thames and the Tweed. As happens on dark days, the\r\nmoney-digger was abroad, and one anecdote deserves record. Many\r\nyears ago, an old widow body had been dunned into buying, for a\r\nfew piastres, a ragged little manuscript from a pauper Maghrabi.\r\nThese West Africans are, par excellence, the magicians of modern\r\nEgypt and Syria; and here they find treasure, like the Greeks\r\nupon the shores of the Northern Adriatic. Perhaps there may be a\r\nbasis for the idea; oral traditions and written documents\r\nconcerning buried hoards would take refuge in remote regions,\r\ncomparatively undisturbed by the storms of war, and inhabited by\r\nraces more or less literary. At any rate, the Maghrabi Darwaysh\r\nwent his ways, assuring his customer that, when her son came of\r\nage, a fortune would be found in the little book. And true\r\nenough, the boy, reaching man's estate, read in its torn pages\r\nample details concerning a Dafi'nah (hoard) of great value. He\r\nwas directed, by the manuscript, to a certain spot upon the\r\nMukattam range, immediately behind the Cairene citadel, where the\r\nremoval of a few stones would disclose a choked shaft: the latter\r\nwould descend to a tunnel, full of rubbish, and one of the many\r\nsidings would open upon the golden chamber. The permission of\r\nGovernment was secured, the workmen began, and the directions\r\nproved true--\"barring\" the treasure, towards which progress was\r\nstill being made. Such was the legend of Cairo, as recounted to\r\nme by my good friend, Yacoub Artin Bey; I can only add to it,\r\nAllaho A'alam!--Allah is all-knowing!\r\n\r\nThe sole cause of delay in beginning exploration was the want of\r\nmoney; and this, of course, even the Prince Minister of Finance\r\ncould not coin. Egypt, the fertile, the wealthy, the progressive,\r\nwas, indeed, at the time all but insolvent. At the suggestion of\r\nforeigners, \"profitable investments,\" which yielded literally\r\nnothing, had been freely made for many a year, and the sole\r\nresults were money difficulties and debt. The European financiers\r\nhad managed admirably for their shareholders; but, having assumed\r\nthe annual national income at a maximum, instead of a minimum,\r\nthey had brought the goose of the golden eggs to the very verge\r\nof death. The actionnaires were to receive, with a punctuality\r\nhardly possible in the East, the usurious interest of six per\r\ncent., not including one per cent. for sinking fund. Meanwhile,\r\nthe officers and officials, military, naval, and civil, had been\r\nin arrears of salary for seven to fifteen months; and even the\r\nJews refused to cash at any price their pay certificates.\r\n\r\nNothing could be more unwise or unjust than the exactions of the\r\ncreditors. Men must live; if not paid, they perforce pay\r\nthemselves; and thus, of every hundred piastres, hardly thirty\r\nfind their way into the treasury. Ten times worse was the\r\ncondition of the miserable Felláhín, who were selling for three\r\nor four napoleons the bullocks worth fifteen per head. Thus they\r\nwould tide over the present year; but a worse than Indian famine\r\nwas threatened for the following. And the \"Bakkál,\" at once petty\r\ntrader and money-lender, whose interest and compound interest\r\nhere amount, as in Bombay, to hundreds per cent., would complete\r\nthe ruin which the \"low Nile\" and the Christian creditor had\r\nbegun.\r\n\r\nA temporary reduction of interest to three per cent., with one\r\nper cent of amortization, should content the greedy shareholder,\r\nwho seeks to combine high profits with perfect security. During\r\nNovember, 1877, there were five M.P.'s at Shepheard's; and all\r\ncried shame upon the financial condition of the country. Sir\r\nGeorge Campbell opened the little game. In his \"Inside View of\r\nEgypt\" (Fortnightly Review, Dec., 1877) he drew a graphic picture\r\nof the abnormal state of poor Egypt; he expressed the sensible\r\nopinion that, in the settlement, the claims of the bond-holders\r\nhave been too exclusively considered, and he concluded that no\r\nmore payments of debt-interest should be made until official\r\narrears are discharged.\r\n\r\nAt last the Phare d'Alexandrie (November 29, 1877), doubtless\r\nunder official inspiration, put forth the following article,\r\ngreatly to the satisfaction of the unfortunate employés:--\r\n\r\n\"Si nos renseignements particuliers sont exacts, le comité des\r\nfinances vient de prendre une excellente décision. Elle consiste\r\nen ce que, aussitôt l'argent pour le paiement du prochain coupon,\r\npréparé, le ministe're, avant tout autre, procédera au paiement\r\ndes appointements arriérés des employés.\r\n\r\n\"Nous apprenons, on outre, que S. A. le ministre des finances,\r\nmême, a déclaré, molu proprio, que jusqu'au complet paiement des\r\narriérés dûs aux employés, et dans le cas oú il se présenterait\r\nune dépense de grande importance, prévue même par le budget, de\r\nne pas en ordonner le paiement sans, au préalable, le sommettre à\r\nl'adhésion du comité.\r\n\r\n\"Nous applaudissons de toutes nos forces à cette bonne nouvelle\r\nd'abord, parcequ'elle affirme une fois de plus la scrupuleuse\r\nexactitude qu'on apporte au paiement des coupons, ensuite elle\r\nprouve le vif intérèt qu' inspire au gouvernement la situation de\r\nses nombreux employés, enfin elle nous fait espérer qu'après\r\navoir songé à eux, on s'occupera aussi à payer les autres sommes\r\nportées et pre'vues au budget de l'année.\"\r\n\r\nAccordingly, on December 2nd, the Prince Minister of Finance took\r\nheart of grace, and distributed among the officials one month's\r\npay, with a promise that all arrears should presently be made\r\ngood. On the same day his Highness issued to the Expedition 2000\r\nnapoleons, in addition to the 620 already expended upon\r\ninstruments and provisions. This was the more liberal, as I had\r\ncalculated the total at 1500: the more, however, the better. In\r\nsuch work it is money versus time, the former saving the latter;\r\nand we were already late in the year--it had been proposed to\r\nstart on November 15th, and we had lost three precious weeks of\r\nfine autumnal weather. The stores were equally abundant: I wanted\r\none forge, and received three.\r\n\r\nOf course, many details had been forgotten; e.g., a farrier and\r\nchange of mule-irons, a tinsmith and tinning tools, a\r\nsulphur-still, boots for the soldiers and the quarrymen, small\r\nshot for specimens, and so forth. I had carried out my idea of a\r\nDragoman with two servants; and the result had been a model\r\nfailure, especially in the most important department. The true\r\n\"Desert cook\" is a man sui generis; he would utterly fail at the\r\nCriterion, and even at Shepheard's; but in the wilderness he will\r\nserve coffee within fifteen minutes, and dish the best of dinners\r\nwithin the hour after the halt.\r\n\r\nMr. Clarke and Lieutenant Amir worked with a will; and they were\r\nably seconded by Colonel Ali Bey Robi and Lieutenant-Colonel (of\r\nthe Staff) Mohammed Bey Báligh. But the finishing touch to such\r\npreparations must be done by the master hand; and my unhappy\r\nvisit to Karlsbad rendered that impossible. The stores and\r\nprovisions were supplied by MM. Voltéra Brothers, of Cairo: I\r\ncannot say too much in their praise; and the packing was as good\r\nas the material. M. Gross, of Shepheard's, was good enough to let\r\nme have a barrel of claret; which improved every week by\r\ntravelling, and which cost only a franc a bottle: it began as a\r\nbon ordinaire, and the little that returned to Cairo ranked with\r\na quasi-grand vin, at least as good as the four-shilling Medoc.\r\nFinally, Dr. Lowe, of Cairo, kindly prepared for us a medicine\r\nchest, containing about £10 worth of the usual drugs and\r\nappliances--calomel, tartar emetic, and laudanum; blister,\r\nplaster, and simple ointment.[EN#14]\r\n\r\nA special train was made ready for Thursday, December 6th; and,\r\nat ten a.m., after taking leave of their Highnesses, who\r\ncourteously wished me good luck and God-speed, the Expedition\r\nfound itself under weigh. We were accompanied to the station by\r\nmany kind friends: my excellent kinsman Lord Francis, and Lady F.\r\nConyngham, Yacoub Artin Bey, General Stone, and MM. George,\r\nGarwood, Girard, and Guillemine.\r\n\r\nThe change from the damp air of Cairo to the drought of the\r\nDesert was magical: light ailments and heavy cares seemed to fall\r\noff like rags and tatters. We halted at Zagázig, remarking that\r\nthis young focus of railway traffic has become the eastern key of\r\nLower Egypt, as Benhá is to the western delta; and prophesying\r\nthat some day, not far distant, will see the glories of Bubastis\r\nrevived. Here we picked up my old friend Haji Wali, whom age--he\r\ndeclares that he was born in the month Mízán of 1797--had made\r\nonly a little fatter and greedier. We gave a wide berth to the\r\nfuture Alexandria, Ismailíyyah, whose splendid climate has been\r\ntemporarily spoilt by the sweet-water canal of the same name. The\r\nsoil became literally sopped; and hence the intermittent fevers\r\nwhich have lately assailed it. A similar disregard for drainage\r\nhas ingeniously managed to convert into pest-houses Simla and\r\nother Himalayan sanitaria.\r\n\r\nThe day ended with running the train into the Suez Docks, so as\r\nto embark all our impediments on the next morning; and I fondly\r\nexpected Saturday to see us sail. But the weather-wise had been\r\ntrue in their forecasts. Friday opened with howling, screaming\r\ngusts of southerly wind; and, during the night we were treated to\r\na fierce display of storm,--thunder and lightning, and rain. The\r\ngale caused one collision on the Canal, and twenty-five steamers\r\nwere delayed near the Bitter Lake; it broke down the railway and\r\nsanded it up for miles, and it levelled fifty English and forty\r\nEgyptian telegraph-posts--an ungentle hint to prefer the\r\ntelephone. Saturday, the beginning of winter, opened with a cold\r\nraw souther and a surging sea, which washed over the Dock-piers;\r\nin such weather it was impossible to embark ten mules without\r\nhorse-boxes. On Sunday the waves ran high, but the gale fell\r\nabout sunset to a dead calm; as usual in the Gulf, the breakers\r\nand white horses at once disappeared; and the slaty surface,\r\nfringed with dirty yellow, immediately reassumed its robes of\r\npurple and turquoise blue. The ill wind, however, had blown us\r\nsome good by deluging with long-hoped-for rain the now barren\r\nmountains of Midian.\r\n\r\nThis \"Fortuna,\" according to the people, sets in with the fourth\r\nCoptic month, Kayhak,[EN#15] which begins the first Arba'ín\r\n(\"Forty-day period\"); and the fourth day is known as the Imtizáj\r\nel-Faslayn, or \"Mixture of the two Seasons\"--autumn and winter.\r\nThe storm is expected to blow three days from the Azyab\r\n(south-east) or from the Shirs (south-west). The qualities of the\r\nseveral winds are described in the following distich:--\r\n\r\n          \"Mirísi Shaytán, wa Gharbi Wazírhu;\r\n          Tiyáb Sultán, wa Sharki Nazírhu.\"\r\n\r\n     \"The south-wester's a Satan, and the wester's his minister;\r\n     The norther's a Sultan, and the easter's his man.\"\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, fair weather was predicted after the first\r\nquarter of the moon (December 12th), according to the saying of\r\nthe Arab sailor:--\r\n\r\n          \"When the moon sleeps, the seaman may sleep;\r\n          When the moon stands, the seaman must stand.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"sleeping\" moon--náim or rákid, also called Yemáni--is that\r\nof the first quarter, which we mark concave to the left; the\r\n\"standing\" moon is that of the last.\r\n\r\nOur stay at Suez was saddened by the sudden death of Marius\r\nIsnard, who had acted cook to the first Khedivial Expedition. The\r\npoor lad, aged only eighteen, had met us at the Suez station,\r\ndelighted with the prospect of another journey; he had neglected\r\nhis health; and, after a suppression of two days, which he madly\r\nconcealed, gangrene set in, and he died a painful death at the\r\nhospital during the night preceding our departure.\r\n\r\nOn December 10th we ran down from Suez Quay in the Bird of the\r\nSea (Tayr el-Bahr), the harbour mouche, or little steam-launch,\r\naccompanied by the Governor, Sa'íd Bey, who has not yet been made\r\na Pasha; by Mr. Consul West; by the genial Ra'íf Bey, Wakíl\r\nel-Komandaníyyah or acting commodore of the station; by Mr.\r\nWilloughby Faulkner, my host at Suez; by the Messieurs Levick,\r\nand by other friends. In the highest spirits we boarded our\r\n\"gun-carriage,\" the aviso Mukhbir (Captain Mohammed Siráj); and,\r\nafter many mutual good wishes, we left the New Docks at 6.10 p.m.\r\n\r\nNothing could be more promising than the weather, a young moon\r\nmirrored in a sea smooth as oil. The \"Giver of Good News\"\r\n(El-Mukhbir), however, for once failed in her mission. She had\r\nlately conducted herself well upon a trial trip round the Zenobia\r\nlightship (\"Newport Rock\").[EN#16] But the two Arab firemen who\r\nacted engineers, worn-out grey-beards that hated the idea of four\r\nmonths on the barbarous Arabian shore, had choked the tubes with\r\nwastage, and had filled the single boiler, taking care to plug\r\nup, instead of opening, the relief-pipe. The consequence was that\r\nthe engines sweated at every pore; steam instead of water\r\nstreamed from the sides; and the chimney discharged, besides\r\nsmoke, a heavy shower of rain. The engine (John Jameson,\r\nengineer, Newcastle-on-Tyne, 1866), a good article, in prime\r\ncondition as far as a literally rotten boiler would allow,\r\npresently revenged itself by splitting the air-pipe of the\r\ncondenser from top to bottom; and after two useless halts the\r\ncaptain reported to me that we must return to Suez. What a\r\nbeginning! The fracture somewhat relieved the machinery; we did\r\nbetter work after than before the accident, but we were ignobly\r\ntowed into dock by the ship's boats.\r\n\r\nA telegram with a procès-verbal was at once sent off to the\r\nPrince; Sa'íd Bey and Ra'íf Bey hastened to our aid, and Mr.\r\nWilliams, superintending engineer of the Khedivíyyah line, with\r\nthe whole of his staff, stripped and set to work at the peccant\r\ntubes and air-pump. They commenced with extinguishing a serious\r\nfire which burst from the waste-room--by no means pleasant when\r\nclose to kegs of blasting-powder carefully sewn up in canvas.\r\nThey laboured with a will, and before sunset Mr. Williams\r\ninformed us that he would guarantee the engines for eight days,\r\nwhen we were starting on a dangerous cruise for four months. He\r\nalso supplied us with an Egyptian boiler-maker and with eleven\r\ninstead of sixty new tubes: we lost forty-two of the old ones\r\nbetween Suez and El-Muwaylah. Before sunset we made a trial trip,\r\nthe wretched old kettle acting tant bien que mal; we returned to\r\nre-embark the soldiers and the mules, and we set out for the\r\nsecond time at 5.30 p.m.\r\n\r\nThe Mukhbir, 130 feet long, 380 tons, and 80 to go horse-power,\r\nunder charge of the English or rather Scotch engineer, Mr. David\r\nDuguid, who had taken the place of the two Arab firemen, began\r\nwith 7 1/2 knots an hour, 68 revolutions per minute, and a\r\npressure of 9 lbs. to the square inch. The condenser-vacuum was\r\n26 inches (30 being complete)--13 lbs. Next morning the rate\r\ndeclined to six miles in consequence of the boiler leaking, and\r\nmatters became steadily worse. As a French writer says of the\r\ngenre humain, we were placed, not entre le bien et le mal, but\r\nentre le mal et le pire. After sundry narrow escapes in the Gulf\r\nof 'Akabah, we were saved, as will be seen, by a manner of\r\nmiracles. Briefly, the Mukhbir caused us much risk, heartburn,\r\nand loss of time.\r\n\r\nSeven a.m. (December 11th) found us crossing the Birkat\r\nFara'ún--Pharaoh's Gulf--some sixty miles from the great port.\r\nIts horrors to native craft I have already described in my\r\n\"Pilgrimage.\" Between this point and Ras Za'faránah, higher up,\r\nthe wind seems to split: a strong southerly gale will be blowing,\r\nwhilst a norther of equal pressure prevails at the Gulf-head, and\r\nvice versâ. Suez, indeed, appears to be, in more ways than one, a\r\nhydrographical puzzle. When it is low water in and near the\r\nharbour, the flow is high between the Straits of Jobal and the\r\nDaedalus Light; and the ebb tide runs out about two points across\r\nthe narrows, whilst the flood runs in on a line parallel with it.\r\nFinally, when we returned, hardly making headway against an angry\r\nnorther, Suez, enjoying the \"sweet south,\" was congratulating the\r\nvoyagers upon their weather.\r\n\r\nThe loss of a good working day soon made itself felt. The north\r\nwind rose, causing the lively Mukhbir, whose ballast, by-the-by,\r\nwas all on deck, to waddle dangerously for the poor mules; and it\r\nwas agreed, nem. con., to put into Tor harbour. We found\r\nourselves at ten a.m. (December 12th) within the natural pier of\r\ncoralline, and we were not alone in our misfortune; an English\r\nsteamer making Suez was our companion. This place has superseded\r\nEl Wijh as the chief quarantine station for the return\r\npilgrimage; and I cannot sufficiently condemn the change.[EN#17]\r\nThe day lagged slowly, as we\r\n\r\n     \"Walked in grief by the merge of the many-voiced\r\n      sounding sea.\"\r\n\r\nBut we looked in vain for our \"tender,\" a Sambúk of fifty tons,\r\nEl-Musahhil (Rais Ramazan), which Prince Husayn had thoughtfully\r\nsent with us as post-boat. She disappeared on the evening of the\r\n11th, and she did not make act of presence until the 16th, when\r\nher master was at once imprisoned in the fort of El-Muwaylah.\r\nMoreover, the owner, Mohammed Bukhayt, of Suez, who had received\r\n£90 as advance for three months--others said £60 for\r\nfour--provided her with only a few days' provisions, leaving us\r\nto ration his crew.\r\n\r\nA wintry norther in these latitudes is not easily got rid of.\r\nAccording to the people, here, as in the 'Akabah Gulf, it lasts\r\nthree days, and dies after a quiet noon; whereas on the 13th,\r\nwhen we expected an escape, it rose angrily at one p.m. I was\r\nmuch cheered by the pleasant news of M. Bianchi, the local\r\nDeputato di Sanità, who assured us that a pernicieuse was raging\r\nat El-Muwaylah, and that it was certain death to pass one night\r\nin the fort. The only fire that emitted all this smoke was the\r\nfact that during the date-harvest of North-Western Arabia, July\r\nand August, agues are common; and that at all seasons the well\r\nwater is not \"honest,\" and is supposed to breed trifling chills.\r\nIn the Prairies of the Far West I heard of a man who rode some\r\nhundreds of miles to deliver himself of a lie. Nothing like\r\nsolitude and the Desert for freshening the fancy. Another\r\nindividual who was much exercised by our journey was Khwájeh\r\nKonstantin, a Syrian-Greek trader, son of the old agent of the\r\nconvent, whose blue goggles and comparatively tight pantaloons\r\ndenoted a certain varnish and veneer. It is his practice to visit\r\nEl-Muwaylah once every six months; when he takes, in exchange for\r\ncheap tobacco, second-hand clothes, and poor cloth, the coral,\r\nthe pearls fished for in April, the gold dust, the finds of coin,\r\nand whatever else will bring money. Such is the course and custom\r\nof these small monopolists, who, at \"Raitha\" and elsewhere, much\r\ndislike to see quiet things moved.\r\n\r\nAt length, after a weary day of far niente, when even le sommeil\r\nse faisait prier, we \"hardened our hearts,\" and at nine p.m., as\r\nthe gale seemed to slumber, we stood southwards. The Mukhbir\r\nrolled painfully off Ras Mohammed, which obliged us with its own\r\npeculiar gusts; and the 'Akabah Gulf, as usual, acted wind-sail.\r\nA long détour was necessary in order to spare the mules, which,\r\nhowever, are much less liable to injury, under such\r\ncircumstances, than horses, having a knack of learning to use\r\nsea-legs.\r\n\r\nThe night was atrocious; so was the next morning; but about noon\r\nwe were cheered by the sight of the glorious mountain-walls of\r\nwell-remembered Midian, which stood out of the clear blue sky in\r\npassing grandeur of outline, in exceeding splendid dour of\r\ncolouring, and in marvellous sharpness of detail. Once more the\r\n\"power of the hills\" was on us.\r\n\r\nThree p.m. had struck before we found ourselves in broken water\r\noff the fort of El-Muwaylah, where our captain cast a single\r\nanchor, and where we had our first escape from drifting upon the\r\nrazor-like edges of the coralline reefs. In fact, everything\r\nlooked so menacing, with surging sea around and sable\r\nstorm-clouds to westward, that I resolved upon revisiting our old\r\nhaunt, the safe and dock-like Sharm Yáhárr. Here we entered\r\nwithout accident; and were presently greeted by the Sayyid 'Abd\r\nel-Rahím, our former Káfilah-báshi, who had ridden from\r\nEl-Muwaylah to receive us. The news was good: a truce of one\r\nmonth had been concluded between the Huwaytát and the Ma'ázah,\r\nprobably for the better plundering of the pilgrims. This year the\r\nlatter were many: the \"Wakfah,\" or standing upon Mount Ararat,\r\nfell upon a Friday; consequently it was a Hajj el-Akbar, or\r\n\"Greater Pilgrimage,\" very crowded and very dangerous, in more\r\nways than one.\r\n\r\nI had given a free passage to one Sulaymán Aftáhi, who declared\r\nhimself to be of the Beni 'Ukbah, when he was a Huwayti of the\r\nJeráfín clan. After securing a free passage and provision gratis,\r\nwhen the ship anchored, he at once took French leave. On return I\r\ncommitted him to the tender mercies of the Governor, Sa'íd Bey.\r\nThe soldiers, the quarry-men, and the mules were landed, and the\r\nhappy end of the first stage brought with it a feeling of intense\r\nrelief, like that of returning to Alexandria. Hitherto everything\r\nhad gone wrong: the delays and difficulties at Cairo; at Suez,\r\nthe death of poor Marius Isnard and the furious storm; the\r\nbreak-down of the engine; the fire in the wasteroom; and, lastly,\r\nthe rough and threatening gale between the harbour and\r\nEl-Muwaylah. What did the Wise King mean by \"better is the end of\r\na thing than the beginning thereof\"? I only hope that it may be\r\napplicable to the present case. In the presence of our working\r\nground all evils were incontinently forgotten; and, after the\r\nunusual dankness of the Egyptian capital, and the blustering\r\nwinds of the Gulf and the sea, the soft and delicate air of the\r\nMidian shore acted like a cordial. For the first time after\r\nleaving Alexandria, I felt justified in taper de l'oeil with the\r\nclearest of consciences.\r\n\r\nThe preliminary stage ended with disembarking at the Fort,\r\nEl-Muwaylah, all our stores and properties, including sundry\r\ncases of cartridges and five hundred pounds of pebble-powder,\r\nwhich had been stored immediately under the main cabin and its\r\neternal cigarettes and allumettes. The implements, as well as the\r\nprovisions, were made over to the charge of an old Albanian, one\r\nRajab Aghá, who at first acted as our magazine-man for a\r\nconsideration of two napoleons per month, in advance if possible.\r\nThis done, the Mukhbir returned into the dock Yáhárr, in order to\r\npatch up her kettle, which seemed to grow worse under every\r\nimprovement. We accompanied her, after ordering a hundred camels\r\nto be collected; well knowing that as this was the Bairam, 'Id,\r\nor \"Greater Festival,\" nothing whatever would be done during its\r\nthree days' duration.\r\n\r\nThe respite was not unwelcome to me; it seemed to offer an\r\nopportunity for recovering strength. At Cairo I had taken the\r\nadvice of a learned friend (if not an \"Apostle of Temperance,\" at\r\nany rate sorely afflicted with the temperance idea), who, by\r\nthreats of confirmed gout and lumbago, fatty degeneration of the\r\nheart and liver, ending in the possible rupture of some valve,\r\nhad persuaded me that man should live upon a pint of claret per\r\ndiem. How dangerous is the clever brain with a monomania in it!\r\nAccording to him, a glass of sherry before dinner was a poison,\r\nwhereas half the world, especially the Eastern half, prefers its\r\npotations preprandially; a quarter of the liquor suffices, and\r\nboth appetite and digestion are held to be improved by it. The\r\nresult of \"turning over a new leaf,\" in the shape of a phial of\r\nthin \"Gladstone,\" was a lumbago which lasted me a long month, and\r\nwhich disappeared only after a liberal adhibition of \"diffusible\r\nstimulants.\"\r\n\r\nIt required no small faith in one's good star to set out for a\r\nsix weeks' work in the Desert under such conditions. My\r\nconsolation, however, was contained in the lines attributed to\r\nhalf a dozen who wrote good English:--\r\n\r\n     \"He either fears his fate too much,\r\n          Or his deserts are small,\r\n     Who dares not put it to the touch,\r\n          To gain or lose it all.\"\r\n\r\nThis time, however, Mind was tranquil, whatever Matter might\r\nsuffer. As the novelist says, \"Lighting upon a grain of gold or\r\nsilver betokens that a mine of the precious metal must be in the\r\nneighbourhood.\" It had been otherwise with my first Expedition: a\r\nforlorn hope, a miracle of moral audacity; the heaviest of\r\nresponsibilities incurred upon the slightest of justifications,\r\nupon the pinch of sand which a tricky and greedy old man might\r\nreadily have salted. It reminds me of a certain \"Philip sober,\"\r\nwho in the morning fainted at the sight of the precipice which he\r\nhad scaled when \"Philip drunk.\" I look back with amazement upon\r\nNo. I.\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\nThe second Khedivial Expedition to Midian was composed of the\r\nfollowing officers and men. The European staff numbered four, not\r\nincluding the commander, viz.:--\r\n\r\nM. George Marie, of the État-Major, Egyptian army, an engineer\r\nconverted into a geologist and mineralogist; he was under the\r\norders of his Highness Prince Husayn Pasha.\r\n\r\nMr. J. Charles J. Clarke, telegraphic engineer, ranking as major\r\nin Egypt, commissariat officer.\r\n\r\nM. Émile Lacaze, of Cairo, artist and photographer.\r\n\r\nM. Jean Philipin, blacksmith.\r\n\r\nBesides these, Mr. David Duguid,--not related to \"Hafed, Prince\r\nof Persia,\"--chief engineer of the gunboat Mukhbir (Captain\r\nMohammed Síráj), accompanied us part of the way on temporary\r\nleave, and kindly assisted me in observing meteorology and in\r\nmaking collections.\r\n\r\nThe Egyptian commissioned officers numbered six, viz.:--\r\n\r\nAhmed Kaptán Musallam, commander in the navy, and ranking as\r\nSakulághási (major). He had been first officer in the Sinnár, and\r\nhe was sent to make astronomical observations; but he proved to\r\nbe a confirmed invalid.\r\n\r\nOf the Arkán-Harb (Staff) were:--\r\n\r\nLieutenant Amir Rushdi, who had accompanied me before.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Yusuf Taufik.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Darwaysh Ukkáb, of the Piyédah or infantry. He was\r\nalso a great sufferer on a small scale.\r\n\r\nSub-Lieutenant Mohammed Farahát, of the Muhandism (Engineers), in\r\ncharge of the Laggámgiyyah or Haggárah (blasters and quarrymen).\r\nHe ended by deserting his duty on arrival at Cairo.\r\n\r\nThe non-commissioned officers, all Egyptians, amounted to\r\nseven:--\r\n\r\nBulúk-amín (writer) Mohammed Sharkáwi (infantry).\r\n\r\nChawush (serjeant) 'Atwah El-Ashírí (infantry).\r\n\r\nChawush (serjeant) Mabrúk Awadh (quarryman); deserted at Cairo.\r\n\r\nOnbáshi (corporal) Higázi Ammár (Staff).\r\n\r\nOnbáshi (corporal) Mohammed Sulaymán (infantry) : also our\r\nbarber, and a good man.\r\n\r\nOnbáshi (corporal) Mahmu'd Abd el-Rahmán (infantry): I had to put\r\nhim in irons.\r\n\r\nOnbáshi (corporal) Ibráhím Hedíb.\r\n\r\nThere were three Nafar (privates) of the Staff:--\r\n\r\n'Ali 'Brahim Ma'danji, generally known as Ali Marie, from the\r\nofficer whom he served; a hard-working man, over-devoted to his\r\nmaster. I recommended him for promotion.\r\n\r\nRamazán Ramazán.\r\n\r\nHasan Mohammed. He proved useful, as he brought with him all the\r\nnecessary tools for mending saddles.\r\n\r\nThe twenty-five privates of infantry were emancipated negroes, a\r\nfew being from the Súdán; composed of every tribe, it was a\r\ncurious mixture, good, bad, and indifferent. Some were slaves who\r\nhad been given, in free gift, by their owners to the Mírí\r\n(Government), and men never part with a good \"chattel,\" except\r\nfor a sufficient cause. As will be seen, many of the names are\r\n\"fancy\":--\r\n\r\nSayyid Ahmed El-Tawíl.\r\n\r\nYúsuf Faragallah (Faraj-Allah).\r\n\r\nFarag 'Ali.\r\n\r\nSa'íd Hasan Básha'. His owner was a Fellah called Hasan\r\nBáshá--peasants often give this title as a name to a boy who is\r\nborn under fortunate circumstances. Sa'íd was a fat, jolly\r\nfellow, a Sidi Bháí from the Mrímá, or mainland of Zanzibar, who\r\nhad wholly forgotten his Kisawáhílí. Corporal Mahmúd was punished\r\nfor keeping him eighteen hours on guard. He was one of the very\r\nfew to whom I gave \"bakhshísh\" after returning to Cairo.\r\n\r\nSa'íd El-Sa'id.\r\n\r\nMirsal Ginaydi.\r\n\r\nMabrúk Rizk.\r\n\r\nAbdullah Mohammed Zaghúl.\r\n\r\nSa'íd Katab.\r\n\r\nFaragallah Sharaf el-Dín.\r\n\r\nFarag Sálih.\r\n\r\nSurúr Mustafá.\r\n\r\nSalámat el-Nahhás; an excellent and intelligent man, who was\r\nattached to the service of M. Lacaze. He distinguished himself by\r\npicking up antiques, until his weakness, the Dá el-Faranj, found\r\nhim out.\r\n\r\nFarag Ahmed Bura'í.\r\n\r\nFarag Mohammed Amín.\r\n\r\nMirgán Sulaymán.\r\n\r\n'Abd el-Maulá.\r\n\r\nMohammedayn.\r\n\r\nMabrúk Hasan Osmán.\r\n\r\nKhayr Ramazán, a large and sturdy negro, from Dár-Wadái, with\r\nlong cuts down both sides of his face; a hard-working and\r\nintelligent soldier, who naturally took command of his fellows. I\r\nmade him an acting corporal, and on return recommended him for\r\npromotion.\r\n\r\nFadl 'Allah 'Ali el-Kholi, a Shillúk, one of the worst tribes of\r\nthe Upper Nile, whom it is forbidden to enlist. He began by\r\nrefusing to obey an order, he pushed an officer out of his way,\r\nand he struck an Arab Shaykh. Consequently, he passed the greater\r\npart of the time in durance vile at the fort of El-Muwaylah.\r\n\r\nMirgán Yúsuf; flogged for insolence to his officer, January 19.\r\n\r\nAbdullah Ibráhím.\r\n\r\nIbráhím Kattáb.\r\n\r\nMabrúk Mansúr Agwah.\r\n\r\nThe Boruji (bugler) Mersál Abú Dunyá, a \"character\" who retires\r\nfor practice to lonely hills and vales. His progress is not equal\r\nto his zeal and ambition.\r\n\r\nThe thirty quarrymen were all Egyptians, and it would be hard to\r\nfind a poorer lot; they never worked, save under compulsion, and\r\nthey stole whatever they could. I examined their packs during the\r\nhomeward cruise, and found that many of them had secreted\r\nGovernment gunpowder:--\r\n\r\n    Ahmed Ashiri.\r\n\r\n    Ahmed Badr.\r\n\r\n    Ahmed el-Wakíl.\r\n\r\n    Omar Sharkáwi.\r\n\r\n5.

He was equally remarkable as a liar and as a\r\ncook.\r\n\r\nBukháyt Ahmed, generally known as El-Ahmar from his red coat; a\r\nDinká slave, some sixty years old, and looking forty-five. He was\r\nstill a savage, never sleeping save in the open air.\r\n\r\nBukhayt Mohammed, popularly termed El-Aswad; a Foráwi\r\n(Dár-Forian) and a good man. He was called \"The Shadow of the\r\nBey.\"\r\n\r\nAhmed Sálih; a stout fellow, and the worst of guides.\r\n\r\nSálim Yúsuf.\r\n\r\nThe head of the caravan was the Sayyid' Abd el-Rahím, accountant\r\nat the Fort el-Muwaylah, of whom I have spoken before. He was\r\nsubsequently recommended by me to his Highness for the post of\r\nNázir or commandant.\r\n\r\nHaji Wali, my old Cairene friend, who lost no time in bolting.\r\n\r\nThere were also generally three Bedawi Shaykhs, who, by virtue of\r\ntheir office, received each one dollar (twenty piastres) per\r\ndiem.\r\n\r\nThe servants and camp followers were:--\r\n\r\nAnton Dimitriadis, the dragoman; a Bakkál or small shopkeeper at\r\nZagázig, and a tenant of Haji Wali.\r\n\r\nGiorgi (Jorgos) Sifenus, the cook, whose main disadvantage was\r\nhis extreme and ultra-Greek uncleanliness.\r\n\r\nPetro Giorgiadis, of Zante; a poor devil who has evidently been a\r\nwaiter in some small Greek café which supplies a cup per hour.\r\n\r\nThese three men were a great mistake; but, as has been said, poor\r\nhealth at Cairo prevented my looking into details.\r\n\r\nYúsuf el-Fazi, Dumánji or quartermaster from the Mukhbir, acting\r\nservant to Captain Ahmed, and a thoroughly good man. He was also\r\nrecommended for promotion.\r\n\r\nAhmed, the Saís or mule-groom; another pauvre diable, rascally\r\nwithal, who was flogged for selling the mules' barley to the\r\nBedawin. He was assisted by the Corporal (and barber) Mohammed\r\nSulaymán and by five quarrymen.\r\n\r\nHusayn Ganínah; a one-eyed little Felláh, fourteen years old,\r\nlooking ten, and knowing all that a man of fifty knows. He was\r\nbody-servant to Lieutenant Yusuf.\r\n\r\nAs usual, the caravan was accompanied by a suttler from\r\nEl-Muwaylah, one Hamad, who sold tobacco, coffee, clarified\r\nbutter, and so forth. He was chaffed with the saying, Hamad fi'\r\nbayt ak--\"Thy house is a pauper.\"\r\n\r\nFinally, there were two dogs: Juno, a Clumber spaniel, young and\r\ninexperienced; Páikí, a pariah, also a pup.\r\n\r\nBesides these two permanents, various \"casuals,\" the dog 'Brahim,\r\netc., attached themselves to our camp.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Chapter II.\r\nThe Start--from El-muwaylah to the \"White Mountain\" and 'Aynúah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI landed at El-Muwaylah, described in my last volume,[EN#18] on\r\nthe auspicious Wednesday, December 19, 1877, under a salute from\r\nthe gunboat Mukhbir, which the fort answered with a rattle and a\r\npatter of musketry. All the notables received us, in line drawn\r\nup on the shore, close to our camp. To the left stood the\r\ncivilians in tulip-coloured garb; next were the garrison, a dozen\r\nBásh-Buzuks en bourgeois, and mostly armed with matchlocks; then\r\ncame out quarrymen in uniform, but without weapons; and, lastly,\r\nthe escort (twenty-five men) held the place of honour on the\r\nright. The latter gave me a loud \"Hip! hip! hurrah!\" as I passed.\r\nThe tents, a total of twenty, including two four-polers for our\r\nmess and for the stores, with several large canvas sheds--páls,\r\nthe Anglo-Indian calls them--gleamed white against the dark-green\r\nfronds of the date-grove; and the magnificent background of the\r\nscene was the \"Dibbagh\" block of the Tiha'mah, or lowland\r\nmountains.\r\n\r\nThe usual \"palaver\" at once took place; during which everything\r\nwas \"sweet as honey.\" After this pleasant prelude came the normal\r\ndifficulties and disagreeables--it had been reported that I was\r\nthe happy possessor of £22,000 mostly to be spent at El-MuwayIah.\r\nThe unsettled Arabs plunder and slay; the settled Arabs slander\r\nand cheat.\r\n\r\nA whole day was spent in inspecting the soldiers and mules; in\r\ndespatching a dromedary-post to Suez with news of our\r\nunexpectedly safe arrival, and in conciliating the claims of\r\nrival Bedawin. His Highness the Viceroy had honoured with an\r\norder to serve us Hasan ibn Salim, Shaykh of the Beni 'Ukbah, a\r\nsmall tribe which will be noticed in a future page. Last spring\r\nthese men had carried part of our caravan to 'Aynúnah; and they\r\nhaving no important blood-feuds, I had preferred to employ them.\r\nBut 'Abd el-Nabi, of the Tagayát-Huwaytát clan, had been spoilt\r\nby over-kindness during my reconnaissance of 1877; besides, I had\r\ngiven him a bowie-knife without taking a penny in exchange. In my\r\nfirst volume he appears as a noble savage, with a mixture of the\r\ngentleman; here he becomes a mere Fellah-Bedawi.\r\n\r\nThe claimants met with the usual ceremony; right hands placed on\r\nthe opposite left breasts--this is not done when there is bad\r\nblood--foreheads touching, and the word of peace, \"Salám,\"\r\nceremoniously ejaculated by both mouths. Then came the screaming\r\nvoices, the high words, and the gestures, which looked as if the\r\nKurbáj (\"whip\") were being administered. The Huwayti stubbornly\r\nrefused to march with the other tribe, whom, moreover, he grossly\r\ninsulted: he professed perfect readiness to carry me and mine\r\ngratis, the while driving the hardest bargain; he spoke of \"our\r\nland,\" when the country belongs to the Khediv; he openly denied\r\nhis allegiance; he was convicted of saying, \"If these Christians\r\nfind gold, there will be much trouble (fitneh) to us Moslems;\"\r\nand at a subsequent time he went so far as to abuse an officer. I\r\nhad \"Shaykh'd\" him (Shayyakht-uh), that is, promoted him in rank,\r\nsaid the Sayyid 'Abd el-Rahím; and the honour had completely\r\nchanged his manners. \"Nasaggharhu\" (We will \"small\" him), was my\r\nreply. The only remedy, in fact, was to undo what had been done;\r\nto cut down, as Easterns say, the tree which I had planted. So he\r\nwas solemnly and conspicuously disrated; the fee, one dollar per\r\ndiem, allotted as travelling and escort-allowance to the chiefs,\r\nwas publicly taken from him, and he at once subsided into an\r\nignoble Walad (\"lad\"), under the lead of his uncle, Shaykh\r\n'Aláyan ibn Rabí. The latter is a man of substance, who can\r\ncollect at least two thousand camels. Though much given to\r\nsulking, on the whole, he behaved so well that, the Expedition\r\nended, I recommended him to his Highness the Viceroy for\r\nappointment to the chieftainship of his tribe, and the usual\r\nyearly subsidy. With him was associated his cousin, Shaykh\r\nFurayj, an excellent man, of whom I shall have much to say; and\r\nthus we had to fee three Bedawi chiefs, including Hasan. The\r\nlatter was a notable intriguer and mischief-maker, ever breeding\r\nbad blood; and his termper was rather violent than sullen. When\r\ninsulted by a soldier, he would rush off for his gun,\r\nostentatiously light the match, walk about for an hour or two\r\nthreatening to \"shyute,\" and then apparently forget the whole\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nAll wanted to let their camels by the day, whereas the custom of\r\nArabia is to bargain for the march. Thus, the pilgrims pay one\r\ndollar per stage of twelve hours; and the post-dromedary demands\r\nthe same sum, besides subsistence-money and \"bakhshi'sh.\" But our\r\nlong and frequent halts rendered this proceeding unfair to the\r\nBedawin. I began by offering seven piastres tariff, and ended by\r\nagreeing to pay five per diem while in camp, and ten when on the\r\nroad.[EN#19] Of course, it was too much; but our supply of money\r\nwas ample, and the Viceroy had desired me to be liberal. In the\r\nNile valley, where the price of a camel is some £20, the average\r\ndaily hire would be one dollar: on the other hand, the animal\r\ncarries, during short marches, 700 lbs. The American officers in\r\nUpper Egypt reduced to 300 lbs. the 500 lbs. heaped on by the\r\nSúdáni merchants. In India we consider 400 lbs. a fair load; and\r\nthe Midianite objects to anything beyond 200 lbs.\r\n\r\nI have no intention of troubling the reader with a detailed\r\naccount of our three first stages from El-Muwaylah to the Jebel\r\nel-Abyaz, or White Mountain.[EN#20] On December 21st, leaving\r\ncamp with the most disorderly of caravans--106 camels instead of\r\n80, dromedaries not included--we marched to the mouth of the Wady\r\nTiryam, where we arrived before our luggage and provisions,\r\nlacking even \"Adam's ale.\" The Shaykhs took all the water which\r\ncould be found in the palm-boothies near the shore, and drank\r\ncoffee behind a bush. This sufficed to give me the measure of\r\nthese \"wall-jumpers.\"\r\n\r\nEarly next morning I set the quarrymen to work, with pick and\r\nbasket, at the north-western angle of the old fort. The latter\r\nshows above ground only the normal skeleton-tracery of coralline\r\nrock, crowning the gentle sand-swell, which defines the lip and\r\njaw of the Wady; and defending the townlet built on the northern\r\nslope and plain. The dimensions of the work are fifty-five mètres\r\neach way. The curtains, except the western, where stood the Báb\r\nel-Bahr (\"Sea gate\"), were supported by one central as well as by\r\nangular bastions; the northern face had a cant of 32 degrees east\r\n(mag.); and the northwestern tower was distant from the sea\r\nseventy-two me'tres, whereas the south-western numbered only\r\nsixty. The spade showed a substratum of thick old wall, untrimmed\r\ngranite, and other hard materials. Further down were various\r\nshells, especially bénitiers ( Tridacna gigantea) the harp (here\r\ncalled \"Sirinbáz\"), and the pearl-oyster; sheep-bones and palm\r\ncharcoal; pottery admirably \"cooked,\" as the Bedawin remarked;\r\nand glass of surprising thinness, iridized by damp to rainbow\r\nhues. This, possibly the remains of lachrymatories, was very\r\ndifferent from the modern bottle-green, which resembles the old\r\nRoman. Lastly, appeared a ring-bezel of lapis lazuli;\r\nunfortunately the \"royal gem,\" of Epiphanus was without\r\ninscription.\r\n\r\nWhilst we were digging, the two staff-officers rode to the\r\ndate-groves of Wady Tiryam, and made a plan of the ancient\r\ndefences--the results of the first Khedivial Expedition had\r\neither not been deposited at, or had been lost in, the Staff\r\nbureau, Cairo. They found that the late torrents had filled up\r\nthe sand pits acting as wells; and the people assured them that\r\nthe Fiumara had ceased to show perennial water only about five or\r\nsix years ago.\r\n\r\nThe second march was disorderly as the first: it reminded me of\r\ndriving a train of unbroken mules over the Prairies; the men were\r\nas wild and unmanageable as their beasts. It was every one's\r\nobject to get the maximum of money for the minimum of work. The\r\nescort took especial care to see that all their belongings were\r\nloaded before ours were touched. Each load was felt, and each box\r\nwas hand-weighed before being accepted: the heaviest, rejected by\r\nthe rich, were invariably left to the poorest and the lowest\r\nclansmen with the weakest and leanest of animals. All at first\r\nespecially objected to the excellent boxes--a great comfort--made\r\nfor the Expedition[EN#21] at the Citadel, Cairo; but they ended\r\nwith bestowing their hatred upon the planks, the tables, and the\r\nlong tent-poles. As a rule, after the fellows had protested that\r\ntheir camels were weighted down to the earth, we passed them on\r\nthe march comfortably riding--for \"the 'Orbán can't walk.\" And no\r\nwonder. At the halting-place they unbag a little barley and\r\nwheat-meal, make dough, thrust it into the fire, \"break bread,\"\r\nand wash it down with a few drops of dirty water. This copious\r\nrefection ends in a thimbleful of thick, black coffee and a pipe.\r\nAt home they have milk and Ghí (clarified butter) in plenty\r\nduring the season, game at times, and, on extraordinary\r\noccasions, a goat or a sheep, which, however, are usually kept\r\nfor buying corn in Egypt. But it is a \"caution\" to see them feed\r\nalle spalle altrui.\r\n\r\nNothing shabbier than the pack-saddles; nothing more rotten than\r\nthe ropes. As these \"Desert ships\" must weigh about half the\r\nsturdy animals of Syria and the Egyptian Delta, future\r\nexpeditions will, perhaps, do well to march their carriage round\r\nby El-'Akabah. The people declare that the experiment has been\r\ntried, but that the civilized animal sickens and dies in these\r\nbarrens; they forget, however, the two pilgrim-caravans.\r\n\r\nAt this season the beasts are half-starved. Their \"kitchen\" is a\r\nmeagre ration of bruised beans, and their daily bread consists of\r\nthe dry leaves of thorn trees, beaten down by the Makhbat, a\r\nflail-like staff, and caught in a large circle of matting\r\n(El-Khasaf). In Sinai the vegetation fares even worse: the\r\nbranches are rudely lopped off to feed the flocks; only \"holy\r\ntrees\" escape this mutilation. With the greatest difficulty we\r\nprevented the Arabs tethering their property all night close to\r\nour tents: either the brutes were cold; or they wanted to browse\r\nor to meet a friend: every movement was punished with a wringing\r\nof the halter, and the result may be imagined.\r\n\r\nWe slept that night at Wady Sharmá. Of this ruined town a plan\r\nwas made for \"The Gold-Mines of Midian,\" by Lieutenant Amir, who\r\nalone is answerable for its correctness. We afterwards found\r\nlayers of ashes, slag, and signs of metal-working to the\r\nnorth-east of the enceinte, where the furnace probably stood. The\r\noutline measures 1906 metres, not \"several kilometres;\" and\r\ndesultory digging yielded nothing but charcoal, cinders, and\r\nbroken pottery. It was not before nine a.m. on the next day that\r\nI could mount my old white, stumbling, starting mule; the delay\r\nbeing caused by M. Marie's small discovery, which will afterwards\r\nbe noticed. We crossed both branches of the Sharmá water; and,\r\nascending the long sand-slope of the right bank, we again passed\r\nthe Bedawi cemetery. I sent Lieutenants Amir and Yusuf to\r\nprospect certain stone-heaps which lay seawards of the graves;\r\nand they found a little heptangular demi-lune, concave to the\r\nnorth; the curtains varying from a minimum length of ten to a\r\nmaximum of eighty me'tres, and the thickness averaging two\r\nmetres, seventy-five centimetres. It was possibly intended, like\r\nthose above Wady Tiryam, to defend the western approach; and,\r\nsuperficially viewed, it looks like a line of stones heaped up\r\nover the dead, with that fine bird's-eye view of the valley which\r\nthe Bedawi loves for his last sleeping-place.\r\n\r\nThence we passed through the dry Báb (\"sea gap\"), cut by a\r\ntorrent in the regular line of the coralline cliff, the opening\r\nof the Wady Melláh, off which lay our Sambúk. Marching up the\r\nWady Maka'dah, our experienced eyes detected many small outcrops\r\nof quartz, formerly unobserved, in the sole and on the banks. The\r\ngranite hills, here as throughout Midian, were veined and dyked\r\nwith two different classes of plutonic rock. The red and pink are\r\nfelsites or fine-grained porphyries; the black and bottle-green\r\nare the coarse-grained varieties, easily disintegrating, and\r\nforming hollows [Illustration with caption: Fortification on the\r\ncliff commanding the right bank of Wady Sharma'.] in the harder\r\ngranite. The ride was made charming by the frontage of\r\npicturesque Jebel 'Urnub, with its perpendicular Pinnacles upon\r\nrock-sheets dropping clear a thousand feet; its jutting bluffs;\r\nits three huge flying Buttresses, that seemed to support the\r\nmighty wall-crest; and its many spits and \"organs,\" some capped\r\nwith finials that assume the aspect of logan-stones. There was no\r\nwant of animal life, and the yellow locusts were abroad; one had\r\nbeen seized by a little lizard which showed all the violent\r\nmuscular action of the crocodile. There were small long-eared\r\nhares, suggesting the leporide; sign of gazelles appeared; and\r\nthe Bedawin spoke of wolves and hyenas, foxes and jackals.\r\n\r\nWe camped upon the old ground to the southwest of the Jebel\r\nel-Abyaz; and at the halt our troubles forthwith began. The\r\nwater, represented to be near, is nowhere nearer than a two\r\nhours' march for camels; and it is mostly derived from\r\nrain-puddles in the great range of mountains which subtends\r\nmaritime Midian. But this was our own discovery. The half-Fellah\r\nBedawin, like the shepherds, their predecessors, in the days of\r\nAbimelech and Jethro, are ever chary of their treasure; the only\r\nobject being extra camel-hire. After eating your salt, a rite\r\nwhose significance, by-the-by, is wholly ignored throughout\r\nMidian and its neighbourhood, they will administer under your\r\neyes a silencing nudge to an over-communicative friend. 'The very\r\nchildren that drive the sheep and goats instinctively deny all\r\nknowledge of the Themáil (\"pits\") and holes acting as wells.\r\n\r\nAt the head of the Wady el-Maka'dah we halted six days (December\r\n24--30); this delay gave us time to correct the misapprehensions\r\nof our flying visit. The height of the Jebel el-Abyaz, whose\r\ncolour makes it conspicuous even from the offing when sailing\r\nalong the coast, was found to be 350 (not 600) feet above the\r\nplain. The Grand Filon, which a mauvais plaisant of a reviewer\r\ncalled the \"Grand Filou,\" forms a \"nick\" near the hill-top, but\r\ndoes not bifurcate in the interior. The fork is of heavy greenish\r\nporphyritic trap, also probably titaniferous iron, with a trace\r\nof silver,[EN#22] where it meets the quartz and the granite.\r\nStanding upon the \"old man\" with which we had marked the top, I\r\ncounted five several dykes or outcrops to the east (inland), and\r\none to the west, cutting the prism from north to south; the\r\nsuperficial matter of these injections showed concentric circles\r\nlike ropy lava. The shape of the block is a saddleback, and the\r\nlay is west-east, curving round to the south. The formation is of\r\nthe coarse grey granite general throughout the Province, and it\r\nis dyked and sliced by quartz veins of the amorphous type,\r\ncrystals being everywhere rare in Midian (?) The filons and\r\nfilets, varying in thickness from eight metres to a few lines,\r\nare so numerous that the whole surface appears to be quartz\r\ntarnished by atmospheric corrosion to a dull, pale-grey yellow;\r\nwhile the fracture, sharp and cutting as glass or obsidian, is\r\ndazzling and milk-white, except where spotted with\r\npyrites--copper or iron. The neptunian quartz, again, has\r\neverywhere been cut by plutonic injections of porphyritic trap,\r\nveins averaging perhaps two metres, with a north-south strike,\r\nand a dip of 75 degrees (mag.) west. If the capping were removed,\r\nthe sub-surface would, doubtless, bear the semblance of a\r\nhoneycomb.\r\n\r\nThe Jebel el-Abyaz is apparently the centre of the quartzose\r\noutcrop in North Midian (Madyan Proper). We judged that it had\r\nbeen a little worked by the ancients, from the rents in the reef\r\nthat outcrops, like a castle-wall, on the northern and eastern\r\nflanks. There are still traces of roads or paths; while heaps,\r\nstrews, and scatters of stone, handbroken and not showing the\r\nnatural fracture, whiten like snow the lower slopes of the\r\nwestern hill base. They contrast curiously with the hard\r\nfelspathic stones and the lithographic calcaires bearing the\r\nmoss-like impress of metallic dendrites; these occur in many\r\nparts near the seaboard, and we found them in Southern as well as\r\nin Northern Midian. The conspicuous hill is one of four mamelons\r\nthus disposed in bird's-eye view; the dotted line shows the\r\nsupposed direction of the lode in the Jibál el-Bayzá, the\r\ncollective name.\r\n\r\nOn the plain to the north of the Jebel el-Abyaz also, I found\r\ncurdles of porphyritic trap, and parallel trap-dykes, cutting the\r\ncourses of large-grained grey granite: as many as three outcrops\r\nof the former appeared within fourteen yards. This convinced me\r\nthat the whole of the solid square, thirty kilometres (six by\r\nfive), where the quartz emerges, is underlaid by veins and\r\nveinlets of the same rock. Moreover, I then suspected, and\r\nafterwards ascertained, that the quartz of the Jibál el-Bayzá, as\r\nthe Bedawin call this section, is not a local peculiarity. It\r\neverywhere bursts, not only the plain between the sea and the\r\ncoast-range, but the two parallels of mountain which confine it\r\non the east. In fact, throughout our northern march the Arabs,\r\nunderstanding that its object was \"Marú,\" the generic name for\r\nquartz,[EN#23] brought us loads of specimens from every\r\ndirection. Nothing is easier than to work the purely superficial\r\npart. A few barrels of gunpowder and half a dozen English miners,\r\nwith pick and crowbar, suffice. Even our dawdling, feckless\r\nquarrymen easily broke and \"spelled\" for camel loading some six\r\ntons in one day.\r\n\r\nOur short se'nnight was not wasted; yet I had an uncomfortable\r\nfeeling that the complication of the country called for an\r\nexploration of months and not hours. Every day some novelty\r\nappeared. The watercourses of the Gháts or coast-range were\r\nstreaked with a heavy, metallic, quartzose black sand which M.\r\nMarie vainly attempted to analyze. We afterwards found it in\r\nalmost every Wady, and running north as far as El-'Akabah;\r\nwhilst, with few exceptions, all our washings of red earth,\r\nchloritic sand, and bruised stone, yielded it and it only. It is\r\napparently the produce of granite and syenite, and it abounds in\r\nAfrican Egypt. I was in hopes that tungsten and titaniferous iron\r\nwould make it valuable for cutlery as the black sand of New\r\nZealand. Experiments in the Citadel, Cairo, produced nothing save\r\nmagnetic iron with a trace of lead. But according to Colonel\r\nRoss, the learned author of \"Pyrology, or Fire Chemistry,\"[EN#24]\r\nit is iserine or magnetic ilmenite, titaniferous iron-sand,\r\ncontaining eighty-eight per cent. of iron (oxides and\r\nsesquioxides), with eleven per cent. of titanic acid.\r\n\r\nThe Arabs brought in fine specimens of hematite and of copper ore\r\nfrom Wady Gharr or Ghurr, six miles to the south of camp. Here\r\nwere found two water-pits in a well-defined valley; the nearer\r\nsome ten miles south-west of the Jebel el-Abyaz, the other about\r\ntwo miles further to the north-west; making a total of twelve.\r\nAbout the latter there was, however, no level ground for tents. A\r\nmile and a half walking almost due north led to a veinlet of\r\ncopper 30 metres long by 0.30 thick, with an east-west strike,\r\nand a dip of 45 degrees south. This metal was also found in the\r\nhills to the south. Crystalline pyroxene and crystallized\r\nsulphates of lime apparently abound, while the same is the case\r\nwith carbonate of manganese, and other forms of the metal so\r\ncommon in Western Sinai. Briefly, our engineer came to the\r\nconclusion that we were in the very heart of a mining region.\r\n\r\nWe made a general reconnaisance (December 27th) of a place whence\r\nspecimens of pavonine quartz had come to hand. Following the Wady\r\n'Ifriyá round the north and east of the White Mountain, we fell\r\ninto the Wady Simákh (of \"Wild Sumach\"), that drains the great\r\ngap between the Pinnacles and the Buttresses of the\r\n'Urnub-Tihámah section. After riding some two miles, we found to\r\nthe south-east fragments of dark, iridescent, and metallic\r\nquartz: they emerge from the plain like walls, bearing\r\nnorth-south, with 36 degrees of westing and a westward dip of 15\r\ndegrees to 20 degrees--exactly the conditions which Australia\r\nseeks, and which produced the huge \"Welcome Nugget\" of Ballarat.\r\nThey crop out of the normal trap-dyked grey granite, and select\r\nspecimens show the fine panaché lustre of copper. M. Marie\r\nafterwards took from one of the geodes a pinch of powder weighing\r\nabout half a gramme, and cupelled a bright dust-shot bead\r\nweighing not less than two centigrammes. Without further\r\nexamination he determined it to be argentiferous, when it was\r\npossibly iron or antimony. On the other hand, the silver\r\ndiscovered in the Grand Filon by so careful and conscientious an\r\nobserver as Gastinel Bey, and the fact that we are here on the\r\nsame line of outcrop, and at a horizon three hundred feet lower,\r\nare reassuring.\r\n\r\nThis vein, which may be of great length and puissance, I took the\r\nliberty of calling the \"Filon Husayn,\" from the prince who had so\r\ngreatly favoured the Expedition. Here we had hit upon the\r\nNegros,[EN#25] or coloured quartzose formations of Mexico, in\r\nwhich silver appears as a sulphure; and we may expect to find the\r\nColorado, or argillaceous, that produces the noble metal in the\r\nforms of chlorure, bromure, and iodure. The former appears\r\neverywhere in Midian, but our specimens are all superficial,\r\ntaken à ciel ouvert. To ascertain the real value and the extent\r\nof the deposits required exposure of the veins at a horizon far\r\nlower than our means and appliances allowed us to reach. If the\r\nrock prove argentiferous I should hope to strike virgin silver in\r\nthe capillary or aborescent shape below. Above it, as on the\r\nsummit of the Jebel el-Abyaz, and generally in the \"Marú\" hills\r\nand hillocks of North Midian, the dull white quartz is\r\ncomparatively barren; showing specks of copper; crystals of\r\npyrites, the \"crow-gold\" of the old English miner, and dark dots\r\nof various metals which still await analysis.\r\n\r\nThus, I would divide the metalliferous quartzes of this\r\nNorth-Midianite region into two chief kinds: those stained green\r\nand light blue, whose chief metallic element is copper, with its\r\nderivatives; and the iridescent Negro, which may shelter the\r\nColorado. In South Midian the varieties of quartz are\r\nincomparably more numerous, and almost every march shows a new\r\ncolour or constitution.\r\n\r\nAbout the Jebel el-Abyaz, as in many mining countries, water is a\r\nserious difficulty. The principal deposit lies some three miles\r\neast of the camping ground in a Nakb or gorge, El-Asaybah,\r\noffsetting from the great Fiumara, \"El-Simákh;\" and apparently it\r\nis only a rain-pool. Throughout Midian, I may say, men still\r\nfetch water out of the rock. M. Philipin, whilst pottering about\r\nthis place, saw two Beden (ibex) with their young, which suggests\r\na permanent supply of drink.[EN#26]\r\n\r\nHowever that may be, Norton's Abyssinian pumps, for which I had\r\nvainly applied at Cairo, would doubtless discover the prime\r\nnecessary in the Wadys, many of the latter being still damp and\r\nmuddy. Moreover, the crible continue à grilles filtrantes, the\r\ninvention of MM. Huet and Geyler, introduced, we are told, into\r\nthe mechanical treatment of metals, a principle which greatly\r\neconomizes fluid. Founded upon the fact that sands of nearly the\r\nsame size, but of different densities, when mixed in liquid and\r\nsubjected to rapid vertical oscillation, range themselves by\r\norder of weight, the heavier sinking and not allowing passage to\r\nlighter matter, the new sieve offers the advantages of a single\r\nand simple instrument, with increased facility for treating poor\r\n\"dirt.\" Finally, as I shall show, the country is prepared by\r\nnature to receive a tramway; and the distance to the sea does not\r\nexceed fourteen miles, liberally computed.[EN#27]\r\n\r\nEither the rain-water affected the health of the party, or it\r\nsuffered from the excessive dryness and variations of the\r\natmosphere, eight to nine hundred feet above sea-level (aner.\r\n29.10), ranging in the tents between 92 degrees by day and 45\r\ndegrees at night, a piercing, killing temperature in the Desert.\r\nMoreover, the cold weather is mostly the unwholesome season in\r\nhot lands, and vice versâ: hence the Arab proverb, Harárat\r\nel-Jebel, wa lá Bard-há (\"The heat of the hills and not their\r\ncold\"). Old Haji Wali lost his appetite, complained of\r\nindigestion, and clamoured to return home; Ahmed Kaptán suffered\r\nfrom Sulb (\"lumbago\") and bad headache; whilst Lieutenant Yusuf\r\nwas attacked by an ague and fever, which raised the mouth\r\nthermometer to 102 degrees--103 degrees, calling loudly for\r\naconite. These ailments affected the party more or less the whole\r\nway, but it was not pleasant to see them begin so soon. When our\r\nwork of collecting specimens--three tons from the Jebel el-Abyaz,\r\nand three from the Filon Husayn--was finished, I resolved upon\r\nreturning to the coast and treating our loads at the Sharmá\r\nwater. We reached the valley mouth on December 30th, and we\r\ngreatly enjoyed the change from the harshness of the inland to\r\nthe mildness of the seaboard air.\r\n\r\nWe stayed at Sharmá, much disliking its remarkably monotonous\r\naspect, for another week, till January 7, 1878. Yule, \"the\r\nwheel,\" despite the glorious tree-logs and roaring fires, had\r\nbeen a failure at the White Mountain. The Dragoman had killed our\r\nlast turkey, and had forgotten to bring the plum-pudding from\r\nEl-Muwaylah: there was champagne, but that is not the stuff\r\nwherewithal to wash down tough mutton. New Year's Day, on the\r\nother hand, had all the honours. Its birth was greeted with a\r\nflow of whisky-punch, wherein wine had taken the place of water;\r\nand we drank the health of his Highness, the Founder of the\r\nExpedition, in a bottle of dry Mumm. The evening ended with music\r\nand dancing, by way of \"praying the Old Year out and the New Year\r\nin.\" Mersál, the Boruji, performed a wild solo on his bugle; and\r\nanother negro, Ahmed el-Shinnáwi, played with the Nái or\r\nreed-pipe one of those monotonous and charming minor-key airs--I\r\ncall them so for want of a word to express them--which extend\r\nfrom Midian to Trafalgar, and which find their ultimate\r\nexpression in the lovely Iberian Zarzuela.[EN#28] The boy Husayn\r\nGenínah, a small cyclops in a brown felt calotte and a huge\r\nmilitary overcoat cut short, caused roars of laughter by his\r\nultra-Gaditanian style of dancing. I have also reason to suspect\r\nthat a jig and a breakdown tested the solidity of the plank\r\ntable, while a Jew's harp represented Europe. In fact, throughout\r\nthe journey, reminiscences of Mabille and the Music Halls\r\ncontrasted strongly with the memories of majestic and mysterious\r\nMidian. And, to make the shock more violent, some friend, malè\r\nsalsus, sent me copies of the cosmopolitan Spectator and the\r\ncourteous Mayfair, which at once became waste paper for Bedawi\r\ncartridges.\r\n\r\nOur Rosh há Shanah (\"New Year's Day\") was further distinguished\r\nby the discovery of a vein and outcrop of metalliferous quartz,\r\nabout half an hour's walk, and bearing nearly east (80 degrees\r\nmag.) from camp. We followed the Wady Sharmá, and found above its\r\n\"gate\" the masonry-foundation of a square work; near it lay the\r\ngraves of the Wild Men, one with the normal awning of palm-fronds\r\nhonoris causâ. There were signs of stone-quarrying, and at one\r\nplace a road had been cut in the rock. Leaving on the north the\r\nleft side of the watercourse, with its rushes (Scirpus), and\r\nhuge-headed reeds (Arundo donax), its dates and Daums--the two\r\nlatter often scorched and killed by the careless Bedawi--we\r\nstruck into a parallel formation, the Wady el Wuday, bone-dry and\r\nmuch trodden by camels. Arrived at the spot, we found that the\r\nconfused masses of hill subtending the regular cliff-line of the\r\nold coast, are composed of grey granite, seamed with snowy\r\nquartz, and cut by the usual bands of bottle-coloured porphyritic\r\ntrap, which here and there becomes red. Some of the heights are\r\nof greenish-yellow chloritic felspar, well adapted for\r\nbrick-making. The surface of the land is scattered with fragments\r\nof white silex and fine red jasper, banded with black oligistic\r\niron: this rock, close, hard, and fine enough to bear cutting,\r\nappears everywhere in scatters and amongst the conglomerates.\r\nOnly one fossil was picked up, a mould so broken as to be quite\r\nuseless.\r\n\r\nWe also followed out M. Marie's find, to which he had been guided\r\nby a patch of red matter, conspicuous on the road from Tiryam to\r\nSharmá. For forty minutes we skirted the seaward face of the old\r\ncliff, a line broken by many deep water-gashes and buttressed by\r\nGoz, or high heaps of loose white sand. We then turned eastwards\r\nor inland, ascended a Nakb (\"gorge\"), and saw, as before, the\r\ncorallines and carbonates of lime altered, fused, scorified, and\r\nblackened by heated injections; the grey granite scored with\r\nquartz veins, running in all rhumbs; and the porphyritic trap\r\nforming crests that projected from the sands. The cupriferous\r\nstone struck east-west, with a dip to the south; the outcrops,\r\nvisible without digging, measured fifteen to twenty metres long,\r\nby one to one and a half in breadth.\r\n\r\nNew Year's Day also restored to us the pup \"Páijí.\" When quite a\r\nbabe, it had walked up to me in the streets of Cairo, evidently\r\nclaimed acquaintanceship, and straightway followed me into\r\nShepheard's, where; having a certain sneaking belief in\r\nmetempsychosis, I provided it with bed and board. During our\r\nthird march to the White Mountain, being given to violent yelps,\r\nwhich startled both mules and camels, the small thing had been\r\nleft to walk, and had apparently made friends with an Arab\r\ngoatherd. After nine days' absence without leave, \"Páijí\"\r\nreappeared, with dirty rags tied round its bony back and wasted\r\nwaist, showing an admirable skeleton, and making the most frantic\r\ndemonstrations of joy. The loss of the poor little brute had\r\naffected all our spirits: we thought that the hyenas and the\r\nravens had seen the last of it; and it received a warm welcome\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nM. Lacaze, unlike the rest, took a violent fancy for the Wady\r\nSharmá: the water-scenery enchanted him. His sketches were almost\r\nconfined to the palm-growth, and to the greenery so unexpected in\r\narid Midian, where, according to the old and exploded opinion,\r\nMoses wrote the Book of Job. The idea of Arabia is certainly not\r\nassociated with flowing rills, and waving trees, and rustling\r\nzephyrs. Every morning I used to awake surprised by the song of\r\nthe Naiad, the little runnel whimpling down its bed of rushes,\r\nstone, and sand; and the response of the palms making music in\r\nthe land-breeze.\r\n\r\nFinally, on New Year's Day, Lieutenant Amir, guided by Shaykh\r\nFurayj, and escorted by soldiers and miners, made a three days'\r\ntrip to the Wady 'Urnub. There he surveyed a large isolated\r\n\"Mará,\" or quartz-hill, some twenty-two to twenty-five direct\r\nmiles south-east of the main outcrop; thus giving a considerable\r\nextent to the northern mining-focus. This feature is described as\r\nbeing four or five times larger than the Jebel el-Abyaz (proper);\r\nand the specimens of quartz and grey granite proved it to be of\r\nthe same formation. It showed a broken outline, with four great\r\nsteps or dykes, which had apparently been worked. In the basal\r\nvalleys, and spread over the land generally, was found a heavy\r\nyellow sand, calcareous and full of silex: the guide called it\r\nAwwal Hismá (the \"Hismá frontier\").\r\n\r\nOur travellers returned by a parallel line, southerly and more\r\ndirect. In the Wady 'Urnub, the Ma'ázah of the Salímát clan\r\nreceived them with apparent kindness, inwardly grumbling the\r\nwhile at their land being \"spied out;\" and they especially\r\nwelcomed Furayj, who, being a brave soldier, is also noted as a\r\npeacemaker. All the men were armed, and wore the same dress as\r\nthe Huwaytát; like these, they also breed camels and asses--that\r\nis, they are not cow-Arabs. Certain travellers on the Upper Nile\r\nhave distributed the Bedawin into these two groups; add\r\nhorse-Arabs and ass-Arabs, and you have all the divisions of the\r\nrace as connected with the so-called \"lower animals.\" About three\r\nhours (= eleven miles) from Sharmá camp, some pyramids of sand\r\nwere pointed out in the Wady Rátiyah: the Bedawin call one of\r\nthem the Goz et-Hannán (\"Moaning Sand-heap\"). They declare that\r\nwhen the Hajj-caravan passes, or rather used to pass, by that\r\nway, before the early sixteenth century, when Sultán Selim laid\r\nout his maritime high-road, a Naubah (\"orchestra\") was wont to\r\nsound within its bowels. This tale, which, by-the-by, is told of\r\ntwo other places in Midian, may have been suggested by the Jebel\r\nel-Nákús (\"Bell Mountain\") in Sinai-land; but as the Arabs\r\nperform visitation and sacrifice to the \"Moaning-heap,\" the\r\nsuperstition probably dates from ancient days. Ruins are also\r\nreported to exist in the Jebel Fa's, the southern boundary of the\r\n'Urnub valley; and, further south, in the Jebel el-Harb, I was\r\ntold by some one whose name has escaped me, of a dolmen mounted\r\nupon three supports. Lieutenant Amir also brought copper ore from\r\nthe Wady 'Urnub, and from the Ras Wady el-Mukhbir specimens of a\r\nmetal which the Arabs use as a kohl or collyrium. It proved,\r\nhowever, iron, not antimony; and the same mistake has been made\r\nin the Sinaitic Peninsula.\r\n\r\nAt Wady Sharmá we rigged up, under the superintendence of M.\r\nPhilipin, a trough and a cradle for washing the black sands, the\r\npounded quartz of the Jebel el-Abyaz, and the red sands; these\r\nlatter had shown a trace of silver (1/10000) to the first\r\nExpedition. We mixed it with mercury and amalgamed it in\r\ngoatskins; the men moved them to and fro; but, of course, the\r\nwater evaporated, and the mass speedily became dry. The upper or\r\nsuperficial white yielded only, as far as our engineer could\r\njudge, a little copper and bright knobs of pyrites. The Negros,\r\nor iridized formations, of the \"Filon Husayn\" on a lower horizon,\r\ngave the dubious result already alluded to. All the experiments\r\nwere conducted in the rudest way. Of course, a quantity of metal\r\nmay have escaped notice; and a fair proportion of the powdered\r\nstone was reserved for scientific treatment in Europe.\r\n\r\nDuring our first trip we had found, upon the right jaw of the\r\nWady Sharmá, a ruined village of workmen, probably slaves, whose\r\nbothans measured some twelve feet by eight. They differ from the\r\nNawámis, or \"mosquito-huts,\" as the word is generally translated,\r\nonly in shape--the latter are circular, with a diameter of ten\r\nfeet--and they perfectly resemble the small stone hovels in the\r\nWady Mukattab, which Professor Palmer (\"Desert of the Exodus,\" p.\r\n202) supposes to have been occupied by the captive miners and\r\ntheir military guardians. This time we ascended the coralline\r\nridge which forms the left jamb. At its foot a rounded and half\r\ndegraded dorsum of stiff gravel, the nucleus of its former self,\r\nshowed a segment of foundation-wall, and the state of the stone\r\nsuggested the action of fire. Possibly here had been a furnace.\r\nThe summit also bears signs of human occupation. The southern\r\npart of the buttress-crest still supports a double concentric\r\ncircle with a maximum diameter of about fifteen feet; the outside\r\nis of earth, apparently thrown up for a rampart behind a moat,\r\nand the inside is of rough stones. Going south along the dorsum,\r\nwe found remains of oval foundations; a trench apparently cut in\r\nthe rock, pottery often an inch and more thick, and broken\r\nhandmills made of the New Red Sandstone of the Hismá. Finally, at\r\nthe northernmost point, where the cliff-edge falls abruptly, with\r\na natural arch, towards the swamp, about one kilometre broad at\r\nthe Báb, we came upon another circle of rough stones. We were\r\ndoubtful whether these rude remains were habitations or old\r\ngraves; nor was the difficulty solved by digging into four of\r\nthem: the pick at once came upon the ground-rock. Hitherto these\r\nruins have proved remarkably sterile; the only products were\r\npotsherds, fragments of hand-mills, and a fine lump of white\r\nmarble (Rukhám), supposed to come from the Jebel el-Lauz.\r\n\r\nAmongst our followers was a \"Kázi of the Arabs,\" one Jabr bin\r\n'Abd el-Nabi, who is a manner of judge in civil, but not in\r\ncriminal matters. Before the suit begins the plaintiff, or his\r\nsurety, deposits a certain sum in coin, corn, or other valuables,\r\nand lays his damages at so much. The defendant, if inclined to\r\ncontest the claim, pays into court the disputed amount, and the\r\nquestion is settled after the traditional and immemorial customs\r\nof the tribe. This man, covetous as any other disciple of\r\nJustinian, was exceedingly anxious to obtain the honorarium of a\r\nShaykh, and he worked hard to deserve it. Shortly before our\r\ndeparture from Sharmá, he brought in some scoriae and slag,\r\nbroken and streaked with copper--in fact, ekvolades. They are\r\nthinly scattered over the seaward slope of the left jaw, where\r\nthe stone nowhere shows a trace of the mineral in situ. As,\r\nhowever, the Expedition had found native copper in three places,\r\nmore or less near the Jebel el-Abyaz, it was decided that the ore\r\nhad been brought from the interior.\r\n\r\nWe were again much puzzled concerning the form of industry which\r\ngave rise to such a large establishment as Sharmá. Agriculture\r\nwas suggested and rejected; and we finally resolved that it was a\r\nbranch-town that supplied ore to the great smelting-place and\r\nworkshop of the coast, 'Aynúnah, and possibly carbonate of lime\r\nto serve for flux.\r\n\r\nThe distance along the winding Wady, between the settlement and\r\nthe sea westward, where the watercourse ends in sand-heaps, is\r\nseven to eight miles, and the coast shows no sign of harbour or\r\nof houses. About three miles, however, to the northwest is the\r\nadmirable Bay of 'Aynu'nah, unknown to the charts. Defended on\r\nboth sides by sandspits, and open only between the west and the\r\nnorth-west, where reefs and shoals allow but a narrow passage,\r\nits breadth across the mouth from east to west measures at least\r\nfive thousand metres, and the length inland, useful for refuge,\r\nis at least three thousand. At the bottom of this noble Límán,\r\nthe Kolpos so scandalously abused by the ancients, are three\r\nsandy buttresses metalled with water rolled stones, and showing\r\ntraces of graves. Possibly here may have been the site of an\r\nancient settlement. The Arabs call the southern anchorage, marked\r\nby a post and a pit of brackish water, El-Musaybah or Musaybat\r\nSharmá. Its only present use seems to be embarking bundles of\r\nrushes for mat-making in Egypt. The north-eastern end of the\r\nlittle gulf is the Gád (Jád), or Mersá of El-Khuraybah, before\r\ndescribed as the port of 'Aynu'nah.\r\n\r\nAt the Musaybah I stationed our tender, the Sambúk El-Musahhil,\r\nwhich carried our heavy goods, specimens by the ton; rations and\r\nstores; forge, planks, and crowbars. The sailors lost no time in\r\nshowing their rapacity. Every day they dunned us for tobacco; and\r\nwhen we made a counter-demand for the excellent fish which was\r\ncaught in shoals, they simply asked, \"What will you pay for it?\"\r\nI imprudently left my keg of specimen-spirits on board this\r\nignoble craft, and the consequence was that it speedily became\r\nbone-dry. The Musaybah bight is a direct continuation of the Wady\r\nel-Melláh, which, joining that of El-Maka'dah, runs straight up\r\nto the Jebel el-Abyaz and to the Filon Husayn. These\r\nmetalliferous quartzes cannot be further from the coast than a\r\nmaximum distance of fourteen miles, and the broad, smooth\r\nwatercourse, with its easy gradients, points it out as the site\r\nof the future tramway. I should prefer a simpler form of the\r\n\"Pioneer Steam Caravan or Saddleback-Railway System,\" patented by\r\nMr John L. Haddan, C.E., formerly of Damascus.[EN#29] He\r\nrecommends iron as the best material for the construction; and\r\nthe cost, delivered at Alexandria, would not exceed £1200,\r\ninstead of £3000 to £20,000 per kilometre, including the rolling\r\nstock. As the distance from the port is nothing, £300 per\r\nkilometre would be amply sufficient for \"fixing up;\" but I should\r\nreduce the price to £500 for the transport of some 50 tons per\r\ndiem. By proper management of the rails or the main rail, it\r\nwould be easy for trained camels to draw the train up the Wady;\r\nand the natural slope towards the sea would give work only to the\r\nbrake where derailments are not possible.\r\n\r\nAt Sharmá we saw the crescent, when the Englishmen turned their\r\nmoney in their pockets, and the Egyptian offficers muttered a\r\nblessing upon the coming moon. Every day we waxed more weary of\r\nthe place; possibly the memories of the first visit were not\r\npleasant. Many in camp still suffered; and an old Bedawi, uncle\r\nto Shaykh 'Alayan, died and was buried at 'Aynúnah. The number of\r\nservants also made us uncomfortable. The head Dragoman, whose\r\nmemory was confined to his carnet, forgot everything; and, had we\r\ntrusted to him, half the supplies would have returned to Suez,\r\nprobably for the benefit of his own shop at Zagázig. I soon found\r\nhis true use, and always left him behind as magazine-man,\r\nstorekeeper, and guardian of reserve provisions. He was also a\r\ndangerous, mischief-making fellow; and such men always find\r\nwilling ears that ought to know better. Petros, the Zante man,\r\nwas the model of a tipotenios (an \"anybody\"), who seemed to have\r\nbeen born limp, without bones or brains. He was sent back as soon\r\nas possible to Cairo. The worst point of these worthies was, that\r\nthey prevented, for their own reasons, the natives working for\r\nus; while they preferred eternal chatter and squabbles to working\r\nthemselves. So the Greek element was reduced to George the cook,\r\na short, squat, unwashed fellow, who looked like a fair-Hercules\r\nout of luck; who worked like three, and who loudly clamoured for\r\na revolver and a bowie-knife. His main fault, professionally\r\nspeaking, was that he literally drenched us with oil till the\r\nstore happily ran out. His complexion was that of an animated\r\nripe olive, evidently the result of his own cookery. His surprise\r\nwhen I imperatively ordered plain boiled rice, instead of a mess\r\ndripping with grease; and when told to boil the fish in sea water\r\nand to serve up the bouillon, was high comedy. Doubtless he has\r\noften, since his return, astounded his \"Hellenion\" by describing\r\nour Frankish freaks and mad eccentricities.\r\n\r\nThe stationary camp also retained Lieutenant Yusuf and MM. Duguid\r\nand Philipin, with thirteen soldiers and sixteen miners. The six\r\ncamels were placed under Gabr, Kázi el-'Orbán; and all the\r\nstay-behinds were charged with washing the several earths, with\r\nscouring the country for specimens, and with transporting sundry\r\ntons of the black sand before mentioned. Old Haji Wali, probably\r\nfrightened by the Arabs, and maddened by the idea that, during\r\nhis absence in the thick of the cotton season, the Fellahs of\r\nZagázig would neglect to pay their various debts, began to\r\n\"malinger\" with such intensity of purpose, that I feared lest he\r\nwould kill himself to spite us. The venerable Shylock, who ever\r\npleaded poverty, had made some £300 by lending a napoleon, say,\r\non January 1st, which became a sovereign on February 1st; not to\r\nspeak of the presents and \"benevolences\" which the debtor would\r\nbe compelled to offer his creditor. So he departed for\r\nEl-Muwaylah, whence some correspondent had warned him that a\r\npilgrim boat was about to start; declaring that he was dying, and\r\ntrotting his mule as hard as it would go, the moment a safe\r\ncorner was turned. He stayed two days on board the gunboat, and\r\nstraightway returned to Egypt and the cotton season:--we had the\r\nsupreme satisfaction, however, to hear that he had gone through\r\nthe long quarantine at Tor. Yet after our return he reproached\r\nme, with inimitable coolness and effrontery, for not having\r\nbehaved well to him.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of January 7th, a walk of two hours and twenty\r\nminutes (= seven miles) northwards, and mostly along the shore of\r\nthe noble \"Musaybat Sharmá,\" transferred us to well-remembered\r\n'Aynúnah. The sea in places washed over slabs of the fine old\r\nconglomerates which, in this country, line the banks and soles of\r\nall the greater Wadys: these are the Cascalho of the Brazil, a\r\nrock which is treated by rejecting the pebbles and by pounding\r\nthe silicious paste. The air was softer and less exciting than\r\nthat of Sharmá; and, although the vegetation was of the crapaud\r\nmort d'amour hue--here a sickly green, there a duller brown than\r\nApril had showed--the scene was more picturesque, the \"Gate\" was\r\ntaller and narrower, and the recollection of a happy first visit\r\nmade me return to it with pleasure. Birds were more abundant:\r\nlong-shanked water-fowl with hazel eyes; red-legged rail; the\r\nbrown swallow of Egypt; green-blue fly-catchers; and a black\r\nmuscivor, with a snowy-white rump, of which I failed to secure a\r\nspecimen. We also saw the tern-coloured plover, known in Egypt as\r\nDomenicain and red kingfishers. The game species were fine large\r\ngreen mallard; dark pintail; quail, and red-beaked brown\r\npartridge with the soft black eye.\r\n\r\nNew formations began to develop themselves, and the sickly hues\r\nof the serpentines and the chlorites, so rich in the New World,\r\nappeared more charming than brow of milk or cheek of rose.[EN#30]\r\nThere were few changes. A half-peasant Bedawi had planted a strip\r\nof barley near the camping place; the late floods had shifted the\r\ncourse of the waters; more date-trees had been wilfully burned; a\r\nbig block of quartz, brother to that which we had broken, had\r\nbeen carried off; and where several of the old furnaces formerly\r\nstood, deep holes, dug by the \"money-hunter,\" now yawned. I again\r\nexamined the two large fragments of the broken barrage, and found\r\nthat they were of uncut stone, compacted with fine cement, which\r\ncontained palm-charcoal.\r\n\r\nAt 'Aynúnah we gave only one day to work. While M. Lacaze\r\nsketched the views, we blasted with gunpowder more than half\r\ncharcoal the Ma'dan el-Fayrúz (\"turquoise mine\"), as the Arabs\r\ncalled it, on the right side of the Wady. The colour and texture\r\nwere so unlike the true lapis Pharanitis that we began to\r\nsuspect, and presently we ascertained from the few remaining\r\nfragments, it had been worked for copper,--the carbonates and the\r\nsilicates which characterize Cyprus. Presently good specimens of\r\nthe latter were brought to us from the Jebel el-Fará by a Bedawi\r\npauper, 'Ayd of the Tagaygát-Huwaytát tribe. These half-naked\r\nshepherds and goatherds, who know every stone in the land, are\r\nits best guides; not the Shaykhs, who, as a rule, see little or\r\nnothing outside their tents. From our camp the direction, as\r\nreported by Ahmed Kaptán, was 102 degrees (mag.), and the\r\ndistance three miles. I afterwards sent Lieutenant Yusuf from\r\nEl-Muwaylah to make a detailed plan.[EN#31]\r\n\r\nWe also dug in an old pit amongst the Christian graves to the\r\nsouth-east of the camp, and below the left jamb of the \"Gate.\"\r\nHere also the Bedawin had been at work; and, when unable to work\r\ndeep enough, they told us wonderful tales of an alabaster slab,\r\nwhich doubtless concealed vast treasures. In Arabia, as in\r\nAfrica, one must look out for what there is not, as well as for\r\nwhat there is. After spending a morning in sinking a twelve-feet\r\nshaft, we came upon a shapeless coralline-boulder, which in old\r\ntimes had slipped from the sea-face of the cliff to the left of\r\nthe valley. I ascended this height, and saw some stones disposed\r\nby the hand of man; but there were no signs of a large\r\nslave-miner settlement like that on the other side of the Báb.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon Mr. Clarke led a party of quarrymen across the\r\ngraveyards to El-Khuraybah, the seaport of 'Aynúnah, and applied\r\nthem to excavating the floor of a cistern and the foundations of\r\nseveral houses; a little pottery was the only result. It was a\r\nslow walk of forty minutes; and thus the total length of the\r\naqueducts would be three miles, not \"between four and five\r\nkilometres.\" I had much trouble and went to some expense in\r\nsending camels to fetch a \"written stone\" which, placed at the\r\nhead of every newly buried corpse, is kept there till another\r\nrequires it. It proved to be a broken marble pillar with a modern\r\nArabic epitaph. In the Gád el-Khuraybah, the little inlet near\r\nthe Gumruk (\"custom-house\"), as we called in waggery the shed of\r\npalm-fronds at the base of the eastern sandspit, lay five small\r\nSambúks, which have not yet begun fishing for mother-of-pearl.\r\nHere we found sundry tents of the Tagaygát-Huwaytát, the half\r\nFellahs that own and spoil the once goodly land; the dogs barked\r\nat us, but the men never thought of offering us hospitality. We\r\nhad an admirable view of the Tihámah Mountains--Zahd, with its\r\n\"nick;\" the parrot-beak of Jebel el-Shátí; the three\r\nperpendicular Pinnacles and flying Buttresses of Jebel 'Urnub;\r\nthe isolated lump of Jebel Fás; the single cupola of Jebel Harb;\r\nthe huge block of Dibbagh, with its tall truncated tower; the\r\nlittle Umm Jedayl, here looking like a pyramid; and the four\r\nmighty horns of Jebel Shárr.\r\n\r\nI left 'Aynúnah under the conviction that it has been the great\r\nWarshah (\"workshop\") and embarking-place of the coast-section\r\nextending from El-Muwaylah to Makná; and that upon it depended\r\nboth Wady Tiryam and Sharmá, with their respective establishments\r\nin the interior. Moreover, the condition of the slag convinced me\r\nthat iron and the baser metals have been worked here in modern\r\ntimes, perhaps even in our own, but by whom I should not like to\r\nsay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Chapter III.\r\n            Breaking New Ground to Magháir Shu'ayb.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn January 9th we left 'Aynúnah by the Hajj-road, and passed\r\nalong the Quarry Hill visited during my first journey: the crest\r\nhas old cuttings and new cuttings, the latter still worked for\r\nBedawi headstones. The dwarf pillar with the mysterious cup is\r\nreflected by the Nubians, who hollow out the upper part of the\r\nstela to a depth of eight or ten inches without adding any\r\nornament. Hence, perhaps, the Sawahíli custom of the inserted\r\nporcelain-plate.\r\n\r\nAfter issuing from the stony and sandy gorge which forms the\r\nshort cut, we regained the Hajj-road, and presently sighted a\r\nscene readily recognized. Fronting us, the northern horizon was\r\nformed by the azure wall of Tayyib Ism,[EN#32] the \"Mountain of\r\nthe Good Name,\" backed by the far grander peaks of Jebel\r\nMazhafah: the latter rises abruptly from the bluer Gulf of\r\nEl-Akabah, and both trend to their culminating points inland or\r\neastward. On our right followed the unpicturesque metalliferous\r\nheap of Jebel Zahd or 'Aynúnah Mountain, whose Brèche de Roland\r\nseems to show from every angle; its chocolate-coloured heights\r\ncontain, they say, furnaces and \"Mashghal,\" or ateliers, where\r\nthe Marú (\"quartz\") was worked for ore. In places it is backed by\r\nthe pale azure peaks of Jebel el-Lauz. This \"Mountain of Almonds\"\r\nis said to take its name from the trees, probably bitter, which\r\nflourish there as within the convent-walls of St. Catherine,\r\nSinai. They grow, I was told, high up in the clefts and valleys;\r\nand here, also, are furnaces both above and below. Of its white,\r\nsparkling, and crystallized marble, truly noble material, a\r\ntombstone was shown to me; and I afterwards secured a slab with a\r\nbroken Arabic inscription, and a ball apparently used for rubbing\r\ndown meal. The Lauz appears to be the highest mountain in\r\nNorthern Midian-land; unfortunately, it is to be reached only viâ\r\nSharaf, two long stations ahead, and I could not afford time for\r\ngeographical research to the prejudice of mineralogical. Its\r\nnearer foot-hill is the Jebel Khulayf; and this feature contains,\r\naccording to the Bedawin, seven wells or pits whose bottom cannot\r\nbe seen. Between the \"Almond Block\" and its northern\r\ncontinuation, Jebel Munífah, we saw a gorge containing water, and\r\nsheltering at times a few tents of the 'Amírát Arabs; in the same\r\nblock we also heard of a Sarbút or rock said to be written over.\r\n\r\nThe regular cone of El-Maklá' ends the prospect in the\r\nnorth-eastern direction. Looking westward, we see the ghastly\r\nbare and naked Secondary formation, the Rughám of the Bedawin,\r\nnot to be confounded with Rukhám (\"alabaster or saccharine\r\nmarble\"). We afterwards traced this main feature of the 'Akabah\r\nGulf as far south as the Wady Hamz. It is composed of the\r\nsulphates of lime--alabaster, gypsum, and the plaster with which\r\nthe Tertiary basin of Paris supplies the world; and of the\r\ncarbonates of lime--marble, chalk, kalkspar, shells, and eggs.\r\nThe broken crests of the Jibál el-Hamrá, the red hills backing\r\nMakná,[EN#33] and the jagged black peaks of their eastern\r\nparallel, the Kalb el-Nakhlah, look like plutonic reefs or\r\nisland-chains emerging from the Secondary sea. The latter, whose\r\nbleached and skeleton white is stained, here and there, by\r\ngreenish-yellow sands, chlorite and serpentine, stands boldly out\r\nfrom the chaos of purpling mountains composing Sinai, and ending\r\nsouthwards in the azure knobs of three-headed Tirán Island. The\r\ncountry, in fact, altogether changed: quartz had disappeared, and\r\nchlorite had taken its place.\r\n\r\nWe passed the night at El-'Usaylah, a Ghadir (or \"hollow\")\r\nwithout drainage, which the sinking of water cakes with mud and\r\ncovers with an irregular circle of salsolaceous trees, a patch of\r\ndark metallic green. This \"'Usaylah\" is eaten by camels, but\r\nrejected by mules. Here our post reached us from Suez on the\r\nseventh day, having started on the 2nd inst. A dollar was offered\r\nto the Bedawi, who eyed the coin indignantly, declaring that it\r\nought to be a ginni (guinea). I had also given him some tobacco,\r\nand repented, as usual, my generosity.\r\n\r\nNext day we finished the last and larger part of the second\r\npilgrim-stage from El-Muwaylah. Our Arabs had been \"dodging;\"\r\nand, much disappointed about converting a two days' into a three\r\ndays' march, they punished us by feeding their camels on the\r\nroad, and by not joining us till the evening. As before, there\r\nwas no game till we approached the springs; yet tufts and\r\nscatters of tamarisks, Samur (Inga unguis) and Arák (Salvadora),\r\nlooked capable of sheltering it. And now, beyond the level and\r\nmonotonous Desert, we began to see our destination;--palms and\r\ntufty trees at the mouth of a masked Wady. This watercourse runs\r\nbetween a background of reddish-brown rock, the foot-hills and\r\nsub-ranges of the grand block, \"El-Zánah,\" to the north; and a\r\nforeground of pale-yellow, stark-naked gypsum, apparently\r\ntongue-shaped. Above the latter tower two sister-quoins of ruddy\r\nmaterial, the Shigdawayn, to which a tale hangs.\r\n\r\nPresently we fell into and ascended the great Wady 'Afár, which\r\nbegins in the Hismá, or Red Region, east of the double\r\ncoast-range. After receiving a network of Secondary valleys that\r\nenable it to flow a torrent, as in France, every ten to twelve\r\nyears, it falls into the Mínat el-'Ayánát, a little port for\r\nnative craft, which will presently be visited. We left this Wady\r\nat a bend, some two hundred metres wide, called the \"Broad of the\r\nJujube,\" from one of the splendid secular trees that characterize\r\nNorth Midian. Near the camping-ground we shall find another\r\nveteran Zizyphus, whose three huge stems, springing from a single\r\nbase, argue a green old age. Here both banks of the Fiumara are\r\nlined with courses of rough stone, mostly rounded and rolled\r\nboulders, evidently the ruins of the water-conduits which served\r\nto feed the rich growth of the lower 'Afa'l. The vegetation of\r\nthe gorge-mouth developed itself to dates and Daums, tamarisks\r\nand salsolaceæ, out of which scuttled a troop of startled\r\ngazelles. We turned the right-hand jamb of the \"Gate,\" and found\r\nourselves at the water and camping-ground of Magháir Shu'ayb.\r\n\r\nThe general appearance of the station-basin is novel,\r\ncharacteristic, and not without its charms, especially when the\r\nsunset paints the plain with the red, red gold, and washes every\r\nbarren peak with the tenderest, loveliest rosy pink. Under an\r\nintensely clear sapphire-coloured sky rises a distant rim of\r\nbroken and chocolate-coloured trap-hills, set off by pale\r\nhillocks and white flats of gypsum, here and there crystallized\r\nby contact with the plutonics. The formation mostly stands up\r\neither in stiff cones or in long spines and ridges, whose\r\nperpendicular wall-like crests are impossible to climb. The snowy\r\ncliffs rest upon shoulders disposed at the \"angle of rest,\" and\r\nthe prevailing dull drab-yellow of the base is mottled only where\r\naccidental fracture or fall exposes the glittering salt-like\r\ninterior. The gashes in the flank made by wind and rain disclose\r\nthe core--grey granite or sandstone coloured by manganese. The\r\ngreater part of the old city was built of this\r\nalabaster-like[EN#34] material. When new, it must have been a\r\nscene in fairy-land; Time has now degraded it to the appearance\r\nand the consistence of crumbling salt. The quoin-shaped hills of\r\nthe foreground, all uptilted and cliffing to the north, show the\r\ncurious mauve and red tints of the many-coloured clays called in\r\nthe Brazil Tauá. Even the palms are peculiar. Their tall, upright\r\ncrests of lively green fronds, their dead-brown hangings, and\r\ntheir trunks charred black by the careless Bedawi, form a quaint\r\ncontrast with the genteel, nattily dressed, and cockneyfied\r\nbrooms of Egypt and the Hejaz. And that grandeur may not be\r\nwanting to the view, on the east rise the peak and pinnacles of\r\nthe Almond Mountain (Jebel el-Lauz), whilst northwards the Jebel\r\nel-Za'nah, a huge dome, forms the horizon.\r\n\r\nThis place, evidently the capital of Madyan Proper, is the <Greek\r\nword>        which Ptolemy (vi. 7) places amongst his \"Mesogeian\r\ntowns\" in north lat. 28 degrees 15 minutes;[EN#35] and it\r\ndeserves more than the two pages of description which Ruppell\r\nbestowed upon it.[EN#36] We will notice its natural features\r\nbefore proceeding to the remains of man. Here the Wady 'Afár\r\ntakes the name of \"El-Badá.\" Sweeping from west to east, it is\r\ndeflected to a north-south line, roughly speaking, by the gate of\r\nthe Shigdawayn, twin-hills standing nearly east and west of one\r\nanother. Now become a broad, well-defined, tree-dotted bed, with\r\nstiff silt banks, here and there twenty to twenty-five feet high,\r\nit runs on a meridian for about a mile, including the\r\npalm-orchard and the camping-ground. It then turns the west end\r\nof the Jebel el-Safrá, a mass of gypsum on the left bank, and it\r\nbends to the east of south, having thus formed a figure of Z.\r\nAfter escaping from the imprisoning hills, the Fiumara bed, now\r\nabout three-quarters of a mile broad, is bisected longitudinally\r\nby a long and broken lump of chloritic or serpentine sandstone;\r\nand rises in steps towards the right bank, upon which the\r\npilgrims camp. Reaching the plain, the Wady flares out wildly,\r\ncontaining a number of riverine islands, temporary, but sometimes\r\nof considerable size. It retains sufficient moisture to support a\r\nclump of palms--that which we saw from afar;--it bends to the\r\nsouth-east, and, lastly, it trends seaward.\r\n\r\nThe \"Water of Bada'\" springs from the base of the hill El-Safrá,\r\noozing out in trickling veins bedded in soft dark mud. It can be\r\ngreatly increased by opening the fountains, and economized by a\r\nroofing of mat: we tried this plan, which only surprised the\r\nunready Arab. After swinging to the left bank and running for a\r\nfew yards, it sinks in the sand; yet on both sides there are\r\nsigns of labour, showing that, even of late years, the valley has\r\nseen better days. Long leats and watercourses have been cut in\r\nthe clay, and are still lined with the white-flowered \"Rijlah,\"\r\nwhose nutritive green leaf is eaten, raw or boiled, by the\r\nFellahs of Egypt: the wild growth, however, is mostly bitter. On\r\nboth sides are little square plots fenced against sheep and goats\r\nby a rude abattis of stripped and dead boughs, Jujube and acacia.\r\nYoung dates have been planted in pits; some are burnt and others\r\nare torn; for the Bedawi, mischievous and destructive as the\r\nCynocephalus, will neither work nor allow others to work. The\r\n'Ushash or frond-and-reed huts, much like huge birds'-nests, are\r\nscattered about in small groups everywhere except near the water.\r\nWherever a collection of bones shows a hyena's lair, the hunters\r\nhave built a screen of dry stone.\r\n\r\nIn fact, Magháir Shu'ayb was spoken of as an Arab \"Happy Valley.\"\r\nBut its owners, the Masá'íd, a spiritless tribe numbering about\r\nseventy tents, are protégés of the Tagaygát. This Huwayti clan is\r\non bad terms with Khizr and 'Brahim bin Makbúl; and the brother\r\nShaykhs of the 'Imrán, recognized by the Egyptian Government,\r\nclaim the land where they have only the right of transit. Bedawi\r\nclans and sub-tribes always combine against stranger families;\r\nbut when there is no foreign \"war,\" they amuse themselves with\r\npilling and plundering, sabring and shooting one another. I\r\nbelieve that the palms were roasted to death by the 'Imrán,\r\nalthough the Shaykhs assured me that the damage was done this\r\nyear, by a careless Mas'údi when cooking his food. The tribe\r\nappears to be Egypto-Arab, like the Huwayta't and the Ma'ázah,\r\nhaving congeners at Ghazzah (Gaze) and at Ras el-Wady, near\r\nEgyptian Tell el-Kebir. Consequently Rüppell is in error when he\r\nsuspects that die Musaiti are ein Judenstamm. The unfortunates\r\nfled towards the sea and left the valley desolate about seven\r\nmonths ago. Their Shaykh is dead, and a certain Agíl bin\r\nMuhaysin, a greedy, foolish kind of fellow, mentioned during my\r\nFirst Journey, aspires to the dignity and the profit of\r\nchieftainship. He worried me till I named a dog after him, and\r\nthen he disappeared.\r\n\r\nThe ruins, of large extent for North Midian, and equal to those\r\nof all the towns we have seen put together, begin with the\r\npalm-orchard on the left bank. The Jebel el-Safrá shows the\r\nfoundations of what may have been the arx. It is a double quoin,\r\nthe taller to the south, the lower to the north, and both bluff\r\nin the latter direction. The dip is about 45 degrees; the upper\r\nparts of the dorsa are scatters of white on brown-yellow stone;\r\nand below it, where the surface has given way, appear\r\nmauve-coloured strata, as if stained by manganese. Viewed in\r\nprofile from the west, the site of El-Muttali'[EN#37], as the\r\nArabs call the hauteville, becomes a tall, uptilted wedge;\r\ncontinued northwards by the smaller feature, and backed by a long\r\nsky-line, a high ridge of plaster, pale coloured with glittering\r\npoints.\r\n\r\nThis isolated \"Yellow Hill,\" a \"horse\" in Icelandic parlance,\r\nrising about two hundred feet above the valley-sole, is separated\r\nby a deep, narrow gorge from the adjacent eastern range. The\r\nslopes, now water-torn and jagged, may formerly have declined in\r\nregular lines, and evidently all were built over to the crest\r\nlike those of Syrian Safet. The foundations of walls and rock-cut\r\nsteps are still found even on the far side of the eastern\r\nfeature. The knifeback is covered with the foundations of what\r\nappears to be a fortified Laura or Palace; a straight street\r\nrunning north-south, with 5 degrees west (mag.). It serves as\r\nbase for walls one metre and a half thick, opening upon it like\r\nrooms: of these we counted twenty on either side. At the northern\r\nend of the \"horse,\" which, like the southern, has been weathered\r\nto a mere spur, is a work composed of two semicircles fronting to\r\nthe north and east. A bastion of well-built wall in three\r\nstraight lines overhangs the perpendicular face of the eastern\r\ngorge: in two places there are signs of a similar defence to the\r\nsouth, but time and weather have eaten most of it away. The\r\nground sounds hollow, and the feet sink in the crumbling heaps:\r\nevidently the whole building was of Rughám (gypsum); and in the\r\nprocess of decay it has become white as blocks of ice, here and\r\nthere powdered with snow.\r\n\r\nOn the narrow, flat ledge, between the western base of this Safrá\r\nand the eastern side of the Bada' valley, lie masses of ruin now\r\nbecome mere rubbish; bits of wall built with cut stone, and\r\nwater-conduits of fine mortar containing, like that of the\r\nPyramids, powdered brick and sometimes pebbles. We carried off a\r\nlump of sandstone bearing unintelligible marks, possibly intended\r\nfor a man and a beast. We called it \"St. George and the Dragon,\"\r\nbut the former is afoot--possibly the Bedawin stole his steed.\r\nThere was a frustum or column-drum of fine white marble, hollowed\r\nto act as a mortar; like the Moslem headstone of the same\r\nmaterial, it is attributed to the Jebel el-Lauz, where ancient\r\nquarries are talked of. There were also Makrákah (\"rub-stones\")\r\nof close-grained red syenite, and fragments of the basalt\r\nhandmills used for quartz-grinding. Part of a mortar was found,\r\nmade of exceedingly light and porous lava.\r\n\r\nSouth-east of the hauteville falls in the now rugged ravine,\r\nKhashm el-Muttalí, \"Snout of the high\" (town). It leads to the\r\napex of the coralline formations, scattered over with fragments\r\nof gypsum, here amorphous, there crystalline or talc-like, and\r\nall dazzling white as powdered sugar. Signs of tent foundations\r\nand of buildings appear in impossible places; and the heights\r\nbear two Burj or \"watchtowers,\" one visible afar, and dominating\r\nfrom its mamelon the whole land. The return to the main valley\r\ndescends by another narrow gorge further to the south-east,\r\ncalled Sha'b el-Darak, or \"Strait of the Shield:\" the tall,\r\nperpendicular, and overhanging walls, apparently threatening to\r\nfall, would act testudo to an Indian file of warriors. High up\r\nthe right bank of this gut we saw a tree-trunk propped against a\r\nrock by way of a ladder for the treasure-seeker. The Sha'b-sole\r\nis flat, with occasional steps and overfalls of rock, polished\r\nlike mirrors by the rain-torrents; the mouth shows remains of a\r\nmasonry-dam some fourteen feet thick by twenty-one long; and\r\nimmediately below it are the bases of buildings and watercourses.\r\n\r\nWalking down the left bank of the great Wady, and between these\r\nsecondary gorges that drain the \"Yellow Hill,\" we came upon a\r\ndwarf mound of dark earth and rubbish. This is the Siyághah\r\n(\"mint and smiths' quarter\"), a place always to be sought, as\r\nBa'lbak and Palmyra taught me. Remains of tall furnaces, now\r\nlevel with the ground, were scattered about; and Mr. Clarke, long\r\ntrained to find antiques, brought back the first coins picked up\r\nin ancient Midian. The total gathered, here and in other parts of\r\nMagháir Shu'ayb, was 258, of which some two hundred were carried\r\nhome untouched; the rest, treated with chloritic and other acids,\r\ncame out well. One was a silver oval which may or may not have\r\nbeen a token. Eleven were thick discs, differing from the normal\r\ntype; unfortunately the legends are illegible. The rest, inform\r\nbits of green stuff, copper and bronze, were glued together by\r\ndecay, and apparently eaten out of all semblance of money until\r\nthe verdigris of ages is removed.\r\n\r\nAll are cast like the Roman \"as\", before B.C. 217, and some show\r\nthe tail. The distinguishing feature is the human eye; not the\r\nouta of Horus,[EN#38] so well known to those who know the\r\nPyramids, but the last trace of Athene's profile. Two are Roman:\r\na Nerva with S.C. on the reverse; and a Claudius Augustus,\r\nbearing by way of countermark a depressed oblong, of 20/100 by\r\n14/100 (of inch), with a raised figure, erect, draped, and\r\nholding a sceptre or thyrsus. There is also a Constantius struck\r\nat Antioch. The gem of the little collection was a copper coin,\r\nthinly encrusted with silver, proving that even in those days the\r\nMidianites produced \"smashers\": similarly, the Egyptian miners\r\n\"did\" the Pharaoh by inserting lead into hollowed gold. The\r\nobverse shows the owl in low relief, an animal rude as any\r\ncounterfeit presentment of the <Greek words>\r\never found in Troy. It has the normal olive-branch, but without\r\nthe terminating crescent (which, however, is not invariably\r\npresent) on the proper right, whilst the left shows a poor\r\nimitation of the legend <Greek word>    (NH). The silvering of\r\nthe reverse has been so corroded that no signs of the goddess's\r\ngaleated head are visible. My friend, Mr. W. E. Hayns, of the\r\nNumismatic Society, came to the conclusion that it is a barbaric\r\nMidianitish imitation of the Greek tetradrachm, which in those\r\ndays had universal currency, like the shilling and the franc. The\r\ncurious bits of metal, which also bear the owl, may add to our\r\nknowledge of the Nabathaean coins, first described, I believe, by\r\nthe learned Duc de Luynes.[EN#39]\r\n\r\nAnother interesting \"find\" was a flat-bottomed, thick-walled clay\r\ncrucible of small size (2 10/16 inches high by 2 4/16 inches\r\nacross the mouth), exactly resembling the article picked up at\r\nHamámát. The latter, however, contains a remnant of litharge,\r\npossibly showing that the old Egyptians worked the silver, which\r\nmay have been supplied by the Colorado quartz.\r\n\r\nI would here crave leave to make a short excursus to the ancient\r\nOphirs of Egypt Proper, where, we are told by an inscription in\r\nthe treasury of Ramses the Great (fourteen centuries before\r\nChrist), the gold and silver mines yielded per annum a total of\r\n32,000,000 minæ = £90,000,000. Dr. H. Brugsch-Bey first drew\r\nattention to Hamámát, where, as he had learned from Diodorus (i.\r\n49--iii 12) and from the papyri, the precious metals had been\r\nextensively worked. The \"Wells of Hama'ma't\" lie between Keneh on\r\nthe Nile and Kusayr (Cosseir) on the Red Sea; and the land is\r\nheld by the Abábdah Arabs, who have taken charge, from time\r\nimmemorial, of the rich commercial caravans. The formation of the\r\ncountry much resembles that of Midian; and the metalliferous\r\nveins run from northeast to south-west. In Arabia, however, the\r\nfilons are of unusual size; in Africa they are small, the\r\nterminating fibrils, as it were, of the Asiatic focus; while the\r\nDark Continent lacks that wealth of iron which characterizes the\r\nopposite coast.\r\n\r\nBy the courtesy of Generals Stone and Purdy I was enabled, after\r\nreturn to Cairo in May, 1878, to inspect the collection.\r\nAdmirably arranged in order of place, and poor as well disposed,\r\nit is, nevertheless, useful to students; and it was most\r\ninteresting to us. The only novelty is asbestos produced in the\r\nschist: the raw material is now imported by the United States,\r\nand used for a variety of purposes. It is said to exist in Mount\r\nSinai; we found none in Midian, where the schist formations are\r\nof great extent, probably because we did not look for it. The\r\ncollection was made by Colonel Colston; and Mr. L. H. Mitchell, a\r\nmining engineer attached to the Egyptian Staff, spent several\r\nweeks spalling sundry tons of quartz. After finding a speck of\r\ngold, the work was considered to be done. General Stone, however,\r\nsensibly deprecated any attempt to exploit the minerals: the\r\ncountry lacks wood and water, and the expense of camel-transport\r\nfrom Hamámát to Kusayr, and thence in ships to Suez, would\r\nswallow up all the profits.\r\n\r\nThat Egypt was immensely rich in old days we know from several\r\nsources. Appian tells us that the treasury of Ptolemy\r\nPhiladelphus contained 740,000 talents; and assuming with\r\nEbers[EN#40] the Egyptian at half the Æginetan, we have the\r\nmarvellous sum of £83,250,000. According to Diodorus (i. 62), the\r\ntreasury of Rhampsinit, concerning which Herodotus (ii. 121, 122)\r\nheard a funny story from his interpreter, contained 4,000,000\r\ntalents, equal to at least £450,000,000. This rich king's\r\ntreasure-house has been found portrayed in the far-famed Temple\r\nof Medinat Habú: the mass of wealth, gold, silver, copper, and\r\nspices, is enormous; and, while the baser metals are in bars, the\r\nprecious are stored in heaps, sacks, and vases.\r\n\r\nThe gold-mines of the old Coptos-plain, the modern Kobt, south of\r\nKeneh, are preserved to all time by the earliest known map. It\r\nhas survived; whilst those of the Milesian Anaximander (B.C. 610-\r\n547), of Hekataeus (ob. B.C. 4 76), also from Miletus and called\r\nthe \"Father of Geography\" (Ebers), and of Ptolemy the Pelusian\r\nare irretrievably lost. A papyrus in the Turin Museum contains a\r\nplan of the mineral region spoken of in two stel, those of\r\nRadesiyyah and Kuban, describing the supply of drinking-water\r\nintroduced into the desert between Kuban and the Red Sea.\r\nChabas[EN#41] has published a coloured facsimile of this map: the\r\ngold-containing mountains are tinted red, and the words \"Tu en\r\nnub\" (Mons aureus) are written over them in hieratics.\r\n\r\nThe only modern gold-workings of Egypt are in the Mudíriyyat\r\n(Nomos) of Famaka, the frontier town, better known as Fayzoghlú\r\nfrom its adjacent heights. The washings were visited lately\r\n(March, 1878) by my enterprising friend, Dr. P. Matteucci, and M.\r\nGessi. In old days this local Cayenne had a very bad name;\r\nconvicts were deported here with a frightful mortality. It is\r\nstill a station for galley-slaves, and it has a considerable\r\ngarrison, but we no longer hear of an abnormal fatality. The\r\nsurface was much turned over by the compulsory miners, and\r\nEuropean geologists and experts were sent to superintend them; at\r\nlast the diggings did not pay and were abandoned. But the natives\r\ndo by \"rule of thumb,\" despite their ignorance of mineralogy,\r\nwithout study of ground, and lacking co-ordination of labour,\r\nwhat the Government failed to do. They have not struck the chief\r\nvein' if any exist; but, during the heavy rains of the Kharif\r\n(\"autumn\") in the valley of the Túmát river, herds of slaves are\r\nsent yearly to wash gold, and they find sufficient to supply the\r\nonly known coin--bars or ingots.\r\n\r\nBeyond the Siyághah, the left bank is gashed by the ravines\r\ndraining the south-eastern prolongation of the \"Yellow Hill.\"\r\nWater cuts through this rotten formation of rubbish like a knife\r\ninto cheese; forming deep chasms, here narrow, there broad, with\r\nwalls built up, as it were, of fragments, and ready to be\r\nlevelled by the first rains. The lines of street and the outlines\r\nof tenements can be dimly traced, while revetments of rounded\r\nboulders show artificial watercourses and defences against the\r\nnow dried-up stream. The breadth of this, the eastern settlement,\r\nvaries with the extent of the ledge between the gypsum-hills and\r\nthe sandy Wady; the length may be a kilometre. The best preserved\r\ntraces of crowded building end with the south-eastern spur of the\r\nJebel el-Safrá. Beyond them is a huge cemetery. The ancient\r\ngraves are pits in the ground; a few still uncovered, the many\r\nyawning wide, and all of them ignoring orientation. Those of the\r\nmoderns, on the contrary, front towards Meccah. The Bedawin of\r\nthis country seem ever to prefer for their last homes the most\r\nancient sites; they place the body in a pit, covered with a large\r\nslab or a heap of stones, but they never fill in the hollow, as\r\nis usual among Moslems, with earth. The arrangements suit equally\r\nwell the hyena and the skull-collector; and thus I was able to\r\nmake a fair collection of Bedawi crania.\r\n\r\nAt the south-eastern end of the outliers projected by the Jebel\r\nel-Safrá, where a gentle slope of red earth falls towards the\r\nvalley-bank, is the only group of building of which any part is\r\nstill standing. The site may be old, but the present ruins are\r\ndistinctly mediæval, dating probably from the days of the\r\nEgyptian \"Mameluke\" Sultans. Beginning from below and to the\r\nsouth-west is a Hauz, or \"cistern,\" measuring twenty-six by\r\nnineteen and a half metres, with a depth of nine to ten feet. The\r\nmaterial is cut sandstone, cemented outside with mortar\r\ncontaining the normal brick-crumbs and pebbles, and inside mixed\r\nwith mud. At the north-eastern and south-western corners are\r\nretaining buttresses in two steps, exactly like those in the\r\ninland fort of El-Wijh; at the two other angles are flights of\r\nstairs, and the sole is a sheet of dried silt. To the south-east\r\nlies the remnant of a small circular furnace, and on the\r\nnorth-north-east a broken wall shows where stood the Bayt\r\nel-Saghir, or smaller reservoir. A narrow conduit of cut stone\r\nleads, with elaborate zigzags, towards two Sakiyah (\"draw-wells\")\r\nhollowed in the gypsum. The Southern, an oval of five metres ten\r\ncentimetres, is much dilapidated; and its crumbling throat is\r\nspanned by a worn-out arch of the surrounding Secondary rock.\r\nClose to the north-west is the other, revetted with cut stone,\r\nand measuring six metres in diameter. It is an elaborate affair;\r\nwith a pointed arch and a regular keystone, circular Sadúd, or\r\n\"walls for supporting the hauling-apparatus,\" and minor\r\nreservoirs numbering three. On a detached hillock, a few paces to\r\nthe north, stands the Fort which defended the establishment. The\r\nshort walls of the parallelogram measure fifteen metres forty\r\ncentimetres; and the long, eighteen metres sixty centimetres: the\r\ngate, choked by ruins, leads to a small hall, with a masked\r\nentrance opening to the right. There is a narrow room under the\r\nstone steps to the west, and two others occupy the eastern side.\r\nThis Fort is to be restored for the better protection of\r\npilgrims; and shortly after our departure an Egyptian engineer,\r\nSulayman Effendi, came from Suez to inspect and report upon it.\r\n\r\nAccording to local modern tradition this scatter of masonry was\r\nthe original site of the settlement, called after the builder Bir\r\nel-Sa'idáni--\"the Well of Sa'ídán.\" For watering each caravan the\r\nproprietor demanded a camel by way of fee; at last a Maghribí,\r\nthat is, a magician, refused to \"part;\" betook himself to the\r\npresent camping ground, sank pits, and let loose the copious\r\nsprings. The old wells then dried up, and the new sources gave to\r\nthis section of the great Wady 'Afál its actual name, Wady\r\nel-Badá--\"of the innovation,\" so hateful to the conservative\r\nsavage. Hence Rüppell's \"Beden,\" which would mean an ibex.\r\n\r\nOn the opposite or right bank of the broad and sandy bed, the\r\ntraces of ancient buildings extend to a far greater distance, at\r\nleast to two kilometres. They have been a continuous line of\r\nforts, cisterns, and tenements, still marked out by the bases of\r\nlong thick walls; the material is mostly gypsum, leprous-white as\r\nthe skin of Gehazi. But here, and indeed generally throughout\r\nMidian, the furious torrents, uncontrolled during long ages by\r\nthe hand of man, have swept large gaps in the masses of homestead\r\nand public buildings. Again the ruins of this section are\r\ndistributable into two kinds--the City of the Living, and the\r\nCity of the Dead.\r\n\r\nThe former, of considerable extent, hugs the watercourse, and\r\ncrowns all the natural spurs that buttress the bed. Beginning\r\nfrom the north lie two blocks of building considerable in extent:\r\nthe southern, called by the Arabs El-Malká, is a broken\r\nparallelogram. Further down stream the bank is a vast strew of\r\nbroken pottery; and one place, covered with glass fragments, was\r\nnamed by our soldiers El-Khammárah--\"the tavern\" or \"the hotel.\"\r\nAs in ancient Etruria, so here, the people assemble after heavy\r\nrains to pick up what luck throws in the way. It is said that\r\nthey often gather gold pieces, square as well as round, bearing\r\nby way of inscription \"prayers\" to the Apostle of Allah. Some of\r\nus, however, had a shrewd suspicion that the Tibr, or \"pure\r\ngold-dust,\" is still washed from the sands, and cast probably in\r\nrude moulds.\r\n\r\nBehind, inland or westward of this southern town, lies the City\r\nof the Dead. Unlike the pitted graveyard to the north-east, the\r\ncemetery is wholly composed of catacombs, which the Bedawin call\r\nMagháir (\"caves\") or Bíbán (\"doors\"). The sites are the sides and\r\nmouths of four little branch-valleys which cut through the\r\nhillocks representing the Wady-bank. The northernmost is known as\r\nWady el-Khurayk, because it drains a height of that name: the\r\nothers bear the generic term Wady el-Safrá, so called, like the\r\nhauteville hill, from the tawny-yellow colour of the rocks. The\r\ncatacombs, fronting in all directions, because the makers were\r\nguided by convenience, not by ceremonial rule, are hollowed in\r\nthe soft new sandstone underlying the snowy gypsum; and most of\r\nthe façades show one or more horizontal lines of natural\r\nbead-work, rolled pebbles disposed parallelly by the natural\r\naction of water. In the most ruinous, the upper layer is a\r\ncornice of hard sandstone, stained yellow with iron and much\r\ncreviced; the base, a soft conglomerate of the same material, is\r\neasily corroded; and the supernal part caves in upon the\r\nprinciple which is destroying Niagara. At each side of the\r\ndoorways is a Mastabah (\"stone bench\"), also rock-hewn, and with\r\ntriple steps. The door-jambs, which have hollowings for hinges\r\nand holes for bars, are much worn and often broken; they are\r\nrarely inclined inwards after the fashion of Egypt. A few have\r\nwindows, or rather port-holes, flanking the single entrance. The\r\npeculiarities and the rare ornaments will be noticed when\r\ndescribing each receptacle; taken as a whole, they are evidently\r\nrude and barbarous forms of the artistic catacombs and\r\ntower-tombs that characterize Petra and Palmyra.\r\n\r\nThe \"Magháir\" may roughly be divided into four topical groups.\r\nThese are--the northern outliers; the \"Tombs of the Kings,\" so\r\ncalled by ourselves because they distinguish themselves from all\r\nthe others; the \"buttressed caves\" (two sets); and the southern\r\noutliers. The first mentioned begin with a ruin on the right jaw\r\nof the Khurayk gorge: it is dug in strata dipping, as usual, from\r\nnorth-west to south-east; it faces eastward, and the entrance\r\ndeclines to the south. All external appearance of a catacomb has\r\ndisappeared; a rude porch, a frame of sticks and boughs, like the\r\nthatched eaves of a Bulgarian hut, stands outside, while inside\r\nsigns of occupation appear in hearths and goat-dung, in smoky\r\nroof, and in rubbish-strewn floor. Over another ruin to the west\r\nare graffiti, of which copies from squeezes and photographs are\r\nhere given: there are two loculi in the southern wall; and in the\r\nsouth-eastern corner is a pit, also sunk for a sarcophagus. A\r\nhill-side to the south of this cave shows another, dug in the\r\nTauá or coloured sandstone, and apparently unfinished: part of it\r\nis sanded up, and its only yield, an Egyptian oil-jar of modern\r\nmake, probably belonged to some pilgrim. Crossing the second\r\ndwarf gorge we find, on the right bank, a third large ruin of at\r\nleast fourteen loculi; the hard upper reef, dipping at an angle\r\nof 30 degrees, and striking from north-west to southeast, fell in\r\nwhen the soft base was washed away by weather, and the anatomy of\r\nthe graves is completely laid bare. Higher up the same Wady is a\r\nfourth Maghárah, also broken down: the stucco-coating still shows\r\nremnants of red paint; and the characters **--possibly Arab\r\n\"Wasm,\" or tribe-marks--are cut into an upright entrance-stone.\r\n\r\nThe precipitous left bank of the third gorge contains the three\r\nfinest specimens, which deserve to be entitled the \"Tombs of the\r\nKings.\" Of these, the two facing eastward are figured by Rüppell\r\n(p. 220) in the antiquated style of his day, with fanciful\r\nforeground and background.[EN#42] His sketch also places solid\r\nrock where the third and very dilapidated catacomb of this group,\r\ndisposed at right angles, fronts southwards. Possibly the façades\r\nmay once have been stuccoed and coloured; now they show the bare\r\nand pebble-banded sandstone.\r\n\r\nThe southernmost, which may be assumed as the type, has an\r\nupright door, flanked by a stone bench of three steps. Over the\r\nentrance is a defaced ornament which may have been the bust of a\r\nman: in Rüppell it is a kind of geometrical design. The frontage\r\nhas two parallel horizontal lines, raised to represent cornices.\r\nEach bears a decoration resembling crenelles or Oriental ramparts\r\nbroken into three steps; the lower set numbers eight, including\r\nthe half ornaments at the corners, and the higher seven. The\r\ninterior is a mixture of upright recesses, probably intended for\r\nthe gods or demons; and of horizontal loculi, whose grooves show\r\nthat they had lids. There is no symmetry in the niches, in the\r\nsarcophagi, or in the paths and passages threading the graves.\r\nThe disposition will best be understood from the ground-plans\r\ndrawn by the young Egyptian officers: their sketches of the\r\nfaçades are too careless and incorrect for use; but the want is\r\nsupplied by the photographs of M. Lacaze.\r\n\r\nAbove these three \"Tombs of the Kings\" are many rock-cavities\r\nwhich may or may not have been sepulchral. Time has done his\r\nworst with them. We mounted the background of a quoin-shaped hill\r\nby a well-trodden path, leading to the remnants of a rude Burj\r\n(\"watch-tower\"), and to a semicircle of dry wall, garnished with\r\na few sticks for hanging rags and tatters. The latter denotes the\r\nMusallat Shu'ayb, or praying-place of (prophet) Jethro; and here\r\nour Sayyid and our Shaykh took the opportunity of applying for\r\ntemporal and eternal blessings. The height at the edge of the\r\nprecipice which, cliffing to the north, showed a view of our camp\r\nand of Yubú and Shu'shú' Islands, was in round numbers 450 feet\r\n(aner. 29.40--28.94). From this vantage-ground we could\r\ndistinctly trace the line of the Wady Makná, beginning in a round\r\nbasin at the western foot of the northern Shigd Mountain and its\r\nsub-range; while low rolling hills, along which we were to\r\ntravel, separated it from the Wady Bada'-Afál to the south.\r\n\r\nTwo other important sets of catacombs, which I will call the\r\n\"buttressed caves,\" are pierced in the right flank of the same\r\ngorge, at the base of a little conical hill, quaintly capped with\r\na finial of weathered rock. The material is the normal silicious\r\ngravel-grit, traversed and cloisonné by dykes of harder stone.\r\nBeginning at the south, we find a range of three, facing eastward\r\nand separated from one another by flying buttresses of natural\r\nrock. No. 1 has a window as well as a door. Next to it is a\r\nsquare with six open loculi ranged from north to south. No. 3\r\nshows a peculiarity--two small pilasters of the rudest\r\n(Egyptian?) Doric, the only sign of ornamentation found inside\r\nthe tombs; a small break in the south-western wall connects it\r\nwith the northernmost loculus of No. 2. Furthest north are three\r\nbevel-holes, noting the beginning of a catacomb; and round the\r\nnorthern flank of the detached cone are six separate caves, all\r\nlaid waste by the furious northern gales.\r\n\r\nThe second set is carved in the bluff eastern end of an adjoining\r\nreef that runs away from the Wady; it consists of four sepulchres\r\nwith the normal buttresses. They somewhat resemble those of the\r\nKings, but there are various differences. No. 2 from the south is\r\nflanked by pilasters with ram's-horn capitals, barbarous forms of\r\nIonic connected by three sets of triglyphs: the pavement is of\r\nslabs; there is an inner niche, and one of the corners has\r\napparently been used as an oven. On a higher plane lies a sunken\r\ntomb, with a deep drop and foot-holes by way of ladder; outside\r\nit the rocky platform is hollowed, apparently for graves. The\r\nother three facades bear the crenelle ornaments; the two to the\r\nnorth show double lines of seven holes drilled deep into the\r\nplain surface above the door, as if a casing had been nailed on;\r\nwhile the northernmost yielded a fragmentary inscription on the\r\nsouthern wall. These are doubtless the \"inscribed tablets on\r\nwhich the names of kings are engraved,\" alluded to in the\r\nJihan-numá of Haji Khahífah.[EN#43] Rounding the reef to the\r\nnorth, we found three catacombs in the worst condition: one of\r\nthem showed holes drilled in the façade.\r\n\r\nThe southern outliers lie far down the Wady 'Afál, facing east,\r\nand hewn in the left flank of a dwarf gulley which falls into the\r\nright bank not far from the site called by our men \"the tavern.\"\r\nThe group numbers three, all cut in the normal sandstone, with\r\nthe harder dykes which here stand up like ears. The principal\r\nitem is the upper cave, small, square, and apparently still used\r\nby the Arabs: in the middle of the lintel is a lump looking like\r\nthe mutilated capital of a column. The two lower caves show only\r\ntraces.\r\n\r\nThere is a tradition that some years ago a Frank (Rüppell?),\r\nafter removing his Arab guides, dug into the tombs, and found\r\nnothing but human hair. Several of the horizontal loculi\r\ncontained the bones of men and beasts: I did not disturb them, as\r\nall appeared to be modern. The floors sounding hollow, gave my\r\ncompanions hopes of \"finds;\" but I had learned, after many a\r\ndisappointment, how carefully the Bedawi ransack such places. We\r\ndug into four sepulchres, including the sunken catacomb and the\r\n(southern) inscribed tomb. Usually six inches of flooring led to\r\nthe ground-rock; in the sarcophagi about eight inches of tamped\r\nearth was based upon nine feet of sand that ended at the bottom.\r\nThe only results were mouldering bones, bits of marble and\r\npottery, and dry seeds of the Kaff Maryam, the Rose of Jericho\r\n(Anastatica), which here feeds the partridges, and which in Egypt\r\nsupplies children with medicine, and expectant mothers with a\r\ncharm. As the plant is bibulous, opening to water and even to the\r\nbreath, it is placed by the couch, and its movement shows what is\r\nto happen. The cave also yielded specimens of bats (Rhinopoma\r\nmacrophyllum), with fat at the root of their spiky tails.\r\n\r\nI have described at considerable length this ruined Madiáma,\r\nwhich is evidently the capital of Madyan Proper, ranking after\r\nPetra. In one point it is still what it was, a chief station upon\r\nthe highway, then Nabatí, now Moslem, which led to the Ghor or\r\nWady el-'Arabah. But in all others how changed! \"The traveller\r\nshall come; he that saw me in my beauty shall come: his eyes\r\nshall search the field; they shall not find me.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Chapter IV.\r\nNotices of Precious Metals in Midian--the Papyri and the Mediæval\r\n                       Arab Geographers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn my volume on \"The Gold-Mines of Midian,\" the popular Hebrew\r\nsources of information--the Old Testament and the Talmud--were\r\nransacked for the benefit of the reader. It now remains to\r\nconsult the Egyptian papyri and the pages of the mediæval Arab\r\ngeographers: extracts from the latter were made for me, in my\r\nabsence from England, by the well-known Arabist, the Rev. G.\r\nPercy Badger.[EN#44] I will begin with the beginning.\r\n\r\nDr. Heinrich Brugsch-Bey, whose \"History of Egypt\"[EN#45] is the\r\nlatest and best gift to Egyptologists, kindly drew my attention\r\nto an interesting passage in his work, and was good enough to\r\ncopy for me the source of his information, tile Harris Papyrus\r\n(No. 1) in the British Museum.\r\n\r\nThe first king of the twentieth Dynasty, born about B.C. 1200,\r\nand residing at Thebes, was Rameses III., whose title, Ramessu\r\npa-Nuter (or Nuti), \"Ramses the god,\" became in the hands of the\r\nGreeks Rhampsinitos. This great prince, ascending the throne in\r\nevil days, applied himself at once to the internal and external\r\neconomy of his realm; he restored the caste-divisions, and\r\ncarried fire and sword into the lands of his enemies. He\r\ntransported many captives to Egypt; fortified his eastern\r\nfrontier; and built, in the Gulf of Suez, a fleet of large and\r\nsmall ships, in order to traffic with Pun and the \"Holy\r\nLand,\"[EN#46] and to open communication with the\r\n\"Incense-country\" and with the wealthy shores of the Indian\r\nOcean.\r\n\r\n\"Not less important,\" says our author (p. 594), \"for Egypt, which\r\nrequired before all things the copper applied to every branch of\r\nher industry, was the sending of commissioners, by land (on\r\ndonkey back!) and by sea, to explore and exploit the rich\r\ncupriferous deposits of 'Atháka (in the neighbourhood of the\r\n'Akabah Gulf?). This metal, with the glance of gold, was there\r\ncast in brick-shape, and was transported by sea to the capital.\r\n\r\n\"The king also restored his attention to the treasures of the\r\nSinaitic Peninsula, which had excited the concupiscence of the\r\nEgyptians since the days of King Senoferu[EN#47] (B.C. 3700).\r\nLoaded with rich presents for the sanctuary of the goddess\r\nHathor, the protectress of Mafka-land, chosen employés were\r\ndespatched on a royal commission to the peninsula, for the\r\npurpose of supplying the Pharaoh's treasury with the highly\r\nprized blue-green copper-stones (Mafka, Turkisen?[EN#48]).\"\r\n\r\nThese lines were published by Dr. Brugsch-Bey before he had heard\r\nof my discoveries of metals and of a modern turquoise-digging in\r\nthe Land of Midian. He had decided that \"'Atháka\" lay to the east\r\nof Suez, chiefly from the insistence laid upon the shipping;\r\nsea-going craft would certainly not be required for a sail of\r\nthree or four hours. Moreover, as I have elsewhere shown, Jebel\r\n'Atakáh, the \"Mountain of Deliverance,\" at the mouth of the Wady\r\nMusá, was referred to the Jews at some time after the Christian\r\nera, and probably during the fourth and fifth centuries, when\r\npilgrimages to the apocryphal Mounts Sinai became the fashion.\r\n\r\nDuring the summer of 1877, Dr. Brugsch-Bey was kind enough to\r\ncopy and to translate the original document, upon which he\r\nfounded his short account of the \"'Atháka\" copper-mines. I offer\r\nit to the reader in full.\r\n\r\nThe order of the alphabet is that adopted by Dr. Brugsch-Bey. It\r\nrelies for the first letter upon the authority of Plutarch, who\r\nasserts that the Egyptian abecedarium numbered the square of five\r\n(twenty-five); and that it opened with --<Greek>--, which also\r\nexpresses the god Thoth;--this is the case with --<hieroglyph>--\r\nthe leaf of some water-plant. The sequence of the letters has been\r\nsuggested by a number of minor considerations: we begin with the\r\nvowels, and proceed to the labial, the liquids, and so\r\nforth.[EN#49]\r\n\r\nThe sense of the highly interesting inscription, in its English\r\norder, would be:--\r\n\r\n\"I have sent my commissioners to the land 'Atháka; to the (those)[EN#50]\r\ngreat mines of copper (or coppers)[EN#51] which are in this place\r\n('Atháka); and their (i.e. the commissioners') ships[EN#52] were loaded,\r\ncarrying them (the metals); while other (commissioners were sent and)\r\nmarched on their asses. No! one never (ter-tot) had heard, since the\r\n(days of the olden) kings, that these (copper) mines had been\r\nfound.[EN#53] The loads (i.e. of the ships and the asses) carried copper;\r\nthe loads were by myriads for their ships, which went thence (i.e. from\r\nthe mines) to Egypt. (After) happily arriving, the loads were landed,\r\naccording to royal order, under the Pavilion,[EN#54] in form of copper-\r\nbricks;[EN#55] they were numerous as frogs (in the marsh),[EN#56] and in\r\nquality they were gold (Nub) of the third degree.[EN#57] I made them\r\nadmired (by) all the world as marvellous things.\"\r\n\r\nThe following lines upon the subject of Midian are from the notes\r\n(p. 143) of Jacob Golius in \"Alferganum\" (small 4to. Amsterdam,\r\n1669), a valuable translation with geographical explanations.\r\nAhmad ibn Mohammed ibn Kathír el-Fargháni derived his \"lakab\" or\r\ncognomen from the province of Farghán (Khokand), to the\r\nnorth-east of the Oxus; he wrote a work upon astronomy, and he\r\nflourished about A.H. 184 (= A.D. 800).\r\n\r\n\"Ibidem (<Arabic> Madyan) Medjan sive Midjan, Antiqui nominis oppidum in\r\nMaris Rubri littore, sub 29 degrees grad. latitudine; ad ortum brumalem\r\ndeflectens à montis Sinæ extremitate: ubi feré site Ptolemæi Modiana,\r\nhaud dubié eadem cum Midjan.

J. de Goeje's edition; Lugduni\r\nBatavorum, 1866)--\"It was related to me by Abú Abíd el-Kásim bin\r\nSallám; who said he was told by Ishák bin Isa, from Malík ibn\r\nAnas and from Rabíat, who heard from a number of the learned,\r\nthat the Apostle of Allah (upon whom be peace!) gave in feoff\r\n(Iktá'at) to Bilál bin el-Háris el-Muzni, mines (Ma'ádin, i.e. of\r\ngold) in the district of Furú' (variant, Kurú'). Moreover, it was\r\nrelated to me by Amrú el-Nákid, and by Ibn Saham el-Antáki (of\r\nAntioch), who both declared to have heard from El-Haytham bin\r\nJamíl el-Antáki, through Hammád bin Salmah, that Abú Makín,\r\nthrough Abú Ikrimah Maulá Bilál bin el-Háris el-Muzni, had\r\naverred 'The Apostle of Allah (upon whom be peace!) enfeoffed the\r\nsaid Bilál with (a bit of) ground containing a mountain and a\r\n(gold) mine; that the sons of Bilál sold part of the grant to one\r\n'Umar bin 'Abd el-'Azíz, when a (gold) mine or, according, to\r\nothers, two (gold) mines were found in it; that they said to the\r\nbuyer, Verily we sold to thee land for cultivation, and we did\r\nnot sell thee (gold) mining-ground; that they brought the letter\r\nof the Apostle (upon whom be peace!) in a (bound) volume: that\r\n'Umar kissed it and rubbed it upon his eyes, and said, Of a truth\r\nlet me see what hath come out of it (the mine) and what I have\r\nlaid out upon it.' Then he deducted from them the expenses of\r\nworking and returned to them the surplus. . . . And I was told by\r\nMusa'b el-Zubayri, from Malik ibn Anas, that the Apostle of Allah\r\n(upon whom be peace!) gave in feoff to Bilál bin Háris mines in\r\nthe district of Fara' (sic). There is no difference of opinion\r\namong our learned men on this subject, nor do I know any of our\r\ncompanions who contradicts (the statement) that the (gold) mine\r\npaid one-fourth per ten (= 2 1/2 per cent.) royalty (to the Bayt\r\nel-Mál, or Public Treasury). Musa'b further relates, from\r\nEl-Zahri, that the (gold) mine defrayed the Zakát or poor-rate:\r\nhe also said that the proportion was one-fifth (= 2 per cent.);\r\nlike that which the people of El-Irák (Mesopotamia) take to this\r\nday from the (gold) mines of El-Fara' (sic), and of Nejrán, and\r\nof Zúl-Marwah, and of Wady El-Kura[EN#60] and others. Moreover,\r\nthe fifth is also mentioned by Safáin el-Thauri, and by Abú\r\nHanífah and Abú Yúsuf, as well as by the people of El-'Irák.\"\r\n\r\nFollows on my list the celebrated Murúj el-Dahab, or \"Meads of\r\nGold,\" by El-Mas'údi, who died in A.H. 346 (= A.D. 957), and\r\nwhose book extends to A.H. 332 (= A.D. 943). Unable to find the\r\ntranslation of my friend Sprenger, I am compelled to quote from\r\n\"Maçoudi. Les Prairies d'Or,\" texte et traduction par C. Barbier\r\nde Meynard et Pavet de Courteille. Société Asiatique, Paris,\r\n1864, vol. iii. pp. 301-305.\r\n\r\n\"Les théologians ne sont pas d'accord sur la question de savoir à\r\nquel peuple appartenait Choâïb (Shu'ayb), fils de Nawil, fils de\r\nRawaïl, fils de Mour, fils d'Anka, fils de Madian, fils\r\nd'Abraham, l'ami de Dieu, quoiqu'il soit certain que sa langue\r\nétait l'arabe. Les uns pensent qu'il appartenait aux races arabes\r\néteintes, aux nations qui ont disparu, à quelque une de ces\r\ngénérations passées dont nous avons parlé. Suivant d'autres, il\r\ns'agirait ici des descendants d'el-Mahd, fils de Djandal, fils de\r\nYâssob, fils de Madian, fils d'Abraham, dont Choâïb etait frére\r\npar la naissance. De cette race sortit un grand nombre de rods\r\nqui s'étaient dispersés dans des royaumes contigus les uns aux\r\nautres ou sépare's. Parmi ces rods il faut distinguer ceux qui\r\nétaient nommés Aboudjed, Hawaz, Houti, Kalamoun, Çafas et\r\nKourichat,[EN#61] tous, comme nous venons de le dire, fils\r\nd'el-Mahd, fils de Djandal. Les lettres de l'alphabet sont\r\nreprésentées précisément par les noms de ces rois, oú l'on\r\nretrouve les vingt-quatre lettres sur lesquelles roule\r\nl'Aboudjed.[EN#62] Il a e'te' dit beaucoup d'autres choses à\r\npropos de ces lettres, comme nous l'avons fait remarquer dans cet\r\nouvrage; mais il n'entre pas dans notre sujet de rapporter ici\r\ntous les systèmes contradictoires imaginés pour l'expliquer la\r\nsignification des lettres.[EN#63] Aboudjed fut roi de la Mecque\r\net de la partie du Hédjaz qui y confine. Hawaz et Houti régnérent\r\nconjointement dans le pays de Weddj (El-Wijh), qui est le\r\nterritoire de Tayif, et la portion du Nedjd qui lui est contigue.\r\nKalamoun exerçait la suzeraineté sur le royaume de Madian; il y a\r\nmême des auteurs qui pensent que son autorité s'étendait\r\nconjointement sur tous les princes et les pays que nous venons de\r\nnommer. Le châtiment du jour de la nuée (Koran, xxvi. 189) eut\r\nlieu sous le re'gne de Kalamoun. Choâïb appelant ces impies à la\r\npénitence, ils le traitèrent de menteur. Alors il les mena,ca du\r\nchâtiment du jour de la nuée, à la suite de quoi une porte du feu\r\ndu ciel fut ouverte sur eux. Choâïb se retire, avec ceux qui\r\navaient cru, dans l'endroit connu sous le nom d'el Aïkah, qui est\r\nun fourré dans la direction de Madian. Cependant, lorsque lcs\r\nincrédules sentirent les effets de la vengeance céleste, et que,\r\nconsumés par une chaleur terrible, ils comprirent enfin la\r\nvérité, ils se mirent à la recherche de Choâïb et de ceux qui\r\navaient cru en lui. Ils les trouvérent abrités sous un nuage\r\nblanc, doucement rafraichi par le zéphire, et ne ressentant en\r\nrien les atteintes de la douleur. Ils les chassèrent de cet\r\nasile, s'imaginant qu'ils y trouveraient eux-mêmes un refuge\r\ncontre le fléau qui les poursuivait. Mais Dieu changea cette nuée\r\nen un feu qui se précipita sur leurs têtes. Mountassir, fils\r\nd'el-Moundir el-Médéni, a parlé de ce peuple et a déploré son\r\ntriste sort dans des vers où il dit:\r\n\r\n\"Les rois des enfants de Houti et de Çafas, qui vivaient dans\r\nl'opulence, et ceux de Hawaz, qui possédaient des palais et des\r\nappartements somptueux,\r\n\r\n\"Régnaient sur la contrée du Hédjaz, et leur beauté était\r\nsemblable à celle des rayons du soleil ou à l'éclat de la rune;\r\n\r\n\"Ils habitaient l'emplacement de la maison sainte, ils\r\nadoucissaient les moeurs de leurs compatriotes et gouvernaient\r\navec illustration et honneur....\r\n\r\n\"Rien de plus curieux que l'histoire de ces rois, le ré'cit de\r\nleurs guerres, de leurs actes, de la manière dont ils\r\ns'emparèrent de ces contrées et établirent leur domination, apres\r\nen avoir exterminé les premières possesseurs. Ceux-ci étaient des\r\npeuples dont nous avons parlé dans nos précédents ouvrages, en\r\ntraitant ce sujet; nous appelons l'attention dans ce livre sur\r\nnous premiers écrits, et nous engageons le lecteur à les\r\nconsulter.\"\r\n\r\nThe next in order of seniority is the well-known Idrísí (A.H. 531\r\n= A.D. 1136). Dr. Badger's Arabic copy not being paged, he has\r\nforwarded to me extracts from the French translation by M. P.\r\nAmadée Jaubert (Paris, 1836), having first compared them with the\r\noriginal:--\r\n\r\nTome 1 p. 5: \"De cette mer de la Chine dérive encore le golfe de\r\nColzoum (Kulzum), qui commence à Bab el-Mandeb,[EN#64] au point\r\nou se termine la mer des Indes. Il s'étend au nord, en inclinant\r\nun peu vers l'occident, en longeant les rivages occidentales de\r\nl'Iemen, le Téháma, l'Hédjaz, jusqu'au pays de Madian, d'Aila\r\n(El-'Akabah), et de Faran; et se termine à la ville de Colzoum,\r\ndont il tire son nom.\"\r\n\r\nP. 142: \"Les districts fortifiés, dependents de la Mecque, sont .\r\n. . Ceux qui sont sous la dépendance de Médine sont . . .\r\nMadyan.\"\r\n\r\nP. 328: \"Pour aller de Misr (Cairo) à' Yetrib (sic pro Yathrib),\r\non passe par les lieux suivants, Aïlah (Aylah) Madian,\" etc.\r\n\r\nP. 333: \"Sur les bords de la mer Colzoum est la ville de Madian\r\n(in orig. Madiyan) plus grande qui Tabouk (Tabúk), et le puits ou\r\nMoïse (sur qui soit le salut!) abreuva le troupeau de Jethro\r\n(E1Shu'ayb). On dit que ce puits est (maintenant) à sec [Note at\r\nfoot: Je lis Mu'attilah comme porte le MS. B., et non\r\nMu'azzamah,[EN#65] leçon donnee par le MS. A.]; et qu'on a élevé\r\naudessus une construction. L'eau nécéssaire aux habitants\r\nprovient de sources. Le nom de Madiyan (sic) de'rive de celui de\r\nla tribu à laquelle Jethro appartenait. Cette ville offre trés\r\npeu de ressources et le commerce y est misérable.\"\r\n\r\nThe following notice of Madyan is taken from the Kitáb el-Buldán\r\n(\"Book of Countries\"),[EN#66] by Ahmed ibn Abí Ya'kúb bin Wádhih,\r\nsurnamed El-Ya'kúbí and El-Kátib (the writer); according to the\r\nArabic colophon it was completed on the morning of Saturday,\r\nShawwál 21, A.H. 607 (= A.D. 1210). The author gives (p. 129, T.\r\nG. J. Juynboll, Lugduni Batavorum, 1861) a description of the\r\nroute from Misr (Egypt, here Cairo) to Meccah. The first ten\r\nstages are--1. Jubb el-'Umayrah; 2. El-Kerkirah (variant,\r\nKarkírah); 3. 'Ajrúd, the well-known fort on the direct\r\nSuez-Cairo line; 4. Jisr el-Kulzum, where the Gulf was crossed;\r\nand, lastly, six Desert marches (Maráhil) to Aylah.[EN#67] The\r\nlatter station is described as a fine city upon the shore of the\r\nSalt Sea, the meeting-place of the pilgrim-caravans from\r\nSyria,[EN#68] Egypt, and the Maghrib (West Africa). It has\r\nmerchandise in plenty, and its people are a mixed race (Akhlát\r\nmin el-Nás).[EN#69] Here also are sold the fine cloaks called\r\nBurdu habaratin, and also known as the Burd of the Apostle of\r\nAllah[EN#70] (upon whom be peace!). He resumes, \"And from Aylah\r\nyou march to Sharaf el-Baghl, and from the latter to Madyan,\r\nwhich is a large and populous city, with abundant springs and\r\nfar-flowing streams of wholesome water; and gardens of\r\nflower-beds. Its inhabitants are a mixed race (Akhlát min\r\nel-Nás).[EN#71] The traveller making Meccah from Aylah takes the\r\nshore of the Salt Sea, to a place called 'Aynúná (variant, 'Uyún,\r\nplural of 'Ayn, an eye of water, a fountain): here are buildings\r\nand palm clumps, and seeking-places (Matalib: see Lane for the\r\nauthorities), in which men search for gold.\" Dr. Badger draws my\r\nattention to the last sentence, which seems also to have been\r\nnoticed by Sprenger (Alt. Geog. p. 32).[EN#72]\r\n\r\nThe following is from the Kitáb Asár el-Bitad (\"Book of the\r\nGeographical Traditions of Countries\"), by the far-famed\r\nZakariyyá bin Mohammed bin Mahmúd, surnamed El-Kazwíní, who died\r\nA.H. 653 = A.D. 1255:--\"Madyan\" (p. 173, edidit. F. Wustenfeld,\r\nGöttingen, 1848) \"is a city of the tribe (Kaum) of Shu'ayb upon\r\nwhom be peace!): it was founded by Madyan, son of Ibrahim, the\r\nFriend (of Allah), the grandfather of Shu'ayb. It exports the\r\nmerchandise of Tabúk between El-Medinah and El-Shám (Damascus).\r\nIn it is the well whence Musá (upon whom be peace!) watered the\r\nflocks of Shu'áyb, and it is said that the well is of great\r\ndepth; and that over it is a building visited by (pious) men.\r\nThis settlement Madyan is subject to the district of Tabaríyyah\r\n(Tiberias); and near it is the well, and at it a rock which Moses\r\nuprooted,[EN#73] and which remains there to the present day.\"\r\n\r\nThe Imám Abú'l-Abbás Ahmed ibn 'Ali Takiyy el-Dín, better known\r\nas \"El-Makrízi,\" wrote his book El-Mawáiz w'el-I'tibár fi' Zikr\r\nel-Khitat w'el-'Asár (\"The Admonition and Examples in\r\nCommemorating Habitations and Traditions\") in A.H. 825 (= A.D.\r\n1421), during the latter part of the second Mamlúk dynasty; and\r\nhe brings down the history to the reign of Kansu Ghori, whose\r\nfort we shall see at El-'Akabah. He tells us (edition of\r\nGottingen, 1848, Sahífah 48), \"The loftiest mountain in Madyan\r\nis called Zubayr.[EN#74] . . . It is also related that amongst\r\nthe settlements of the (Madyanite) tribe are the villages of\r\nPetræa (<Arabic>), namely, the Kúrat (circuit) of El-Tor, and\r\nFárán (Pharan), and Ráyeh, and Kulzum, and Aylah (El-'Akabah)\r\nwith its surroundings; Madyan with its surroundings; and Awíd and\r\nHaurá (Leukè-Kóme) with their surroundings, and Badá[EN#75] and\r\nShaghab.\"[EN#76] He speaks of many ruined cities whose\r\ninhabitants had disappeared: forty, however, remained; some with,\r\nand others without, names. Between El-Hejaz and Egypt-Syria were\r\nsixteen cities, ten of them lying towards Palestine. The most\r\nimportant were El-Khalasah,[EN#77] with its idol-temple destroyed\r\nby Mohammed, and El-Sani'tah, whose stones had been removed to\r\nbuild Ghazzah (Gaza). The others were El-Mederah, El-Minyah,\r\nEl-A'waj, El-Khuwayrak, El-Bírayn, El-Máayn, El-Sebá, and\r\nEl-Mu'allak.[EN#78]\r\n\r\nThe Marásid el-Ittílá 'alá Asmá el-Amkanat w'el-Buká'\r\n(\"Observations of Information on the Names of Places and\r\nCountries\"), which contains two dates in the body of the work,\r\nviz. A.H. 997 ( = A.D. 1589) and A.H. 1168 (A.D. = 1755), and\r\nwhich is probably compiled from El-Kazwíní, says sub voce Madyan,\r\nafter giving the \"movement\" of the word: \"It is a city of the\r\ntribe of Shu'ayb, opposite Tabúk, and upon the sea of El-Kulzum,\r\nsix stages (Maráhil) separating the two. It is larger than Tabúk,\r\nand in it is the well whence Moses watered the flocks of\r\nShu'ayb.\" Finally, it repeats that Madyan is under the district\r\nof \"Tabariyyá\" or Tiberias[EN#79] (vol. iii. p. 64, edidit. T. G.\r\nJ. Juynboll, Lugduni Batavorum, 1854, e duobus Codd. MSS.).\r\n\r\nI conclude this unpopular chapter with some remarks by Dr. Badger\r\nconcerning the apparent connection of Jethro and\r\nEl-Medínah:[EN#80] \"It struck me when studying 'Madyan,' which is\r\nthe name of a place as well as of a man,[EN#81] that 'Yáthrib,'\r\nthe ancient term of al-Madínah, might have served the same double\r\npurpose. At all events, it was singular to find a Yáthrib\r\nsomewhere near Madyan, and that the word was not far removed from\r\nthe <Hebrew> (Yithro), the name given in Hebrew to Moses'\r\nMidianite father-in-law. I also note that the Septuagint renders\r\nthe Hebrew Yithro by <Greek> Peshito by <Arabic> (Yathrûn),\r\nwhich the new Arabic version of the Bible, published at Bairu't\r\n(Syria), follows; making it <Arabic> (Yáthrûn). The name in\r\nHebrew (Exod. iv. 18) is also written <Hebrew> (Yether).\r\n\r\n\"My theory is this. Firstly, there is no dependence to be placed\r\non the Masoretic points, especially when affixed to names of\r\nplaces. Secondly, we have no certain knowledge of the language\r\nused by the Midianites in those ancient times. Their territory\r\nextended northwards towards Palestine, and from their very\r\nintimate relations with the Israelites, as friends and as\r\nenemies, both nations appear to have understood each other\r\nperfectly. May not their language, then, have been a dialect of\r\nthe Aramean?[EN#82] If so, the <Hebrew> (Yithro) of the Bible\r\nmight have been <Hebrew> (Yithrab, Yathrib, etc.). Instances of\r\nthe apocopated <Hebrew>   (b) are common in the Chaldean or\r\nSyro-Chaldaic at the present day; e.g. <Arabic> (Yáheb Alaha) is\r\npronounced Yáu-Alaha; <Arabic> (Yashuá'-yaheb) becomes\r\nYashuá-yau, etc., the final Beth <Arabic> (b) or the <Arabic>\r\n(heb) being converted into a <Arabic> (w). Hence why may not\r\n<Hebrew> (Yithro) have been originally <Hebrew> (Yithrab or\r\nYathrib)? Of course, this is only a conjecture of mine.\"\r\n\r\nMr. E. Stanley Poole (loc. cit.) says that the Arabs dispute\r\nwhether the name \"Medyen\" be foreign or Arabic; and whether\r\n\"Medyen\" spoke Arabic. He considers the absurd enumeration of the\r\nalphabetical kings (El-Mas'údi, quoted above) to be curious, as\r\npossibly containing some vague reference to the language of\r\nMidian. When these kings are said contemporaneously to have ruled\r\nover Meccah, Western Nejd, Yemen, \"Medyen,\" Egypt, etc., it is\r\nextremely improbable that Midian ever penetrated into Yemen,\r\nnotwithstanding the hints of Arab authors to the contrary. Yákút\r\nel-Hamawi (born A.H. 574 or 575 = A.D. 1178-79, and died A.H. 626\r\n= A.D. 1228), in the Mu'jam el-Buldán (cited in the Journ. of the\r\nDeutsch. Morgen. Gesellschaft), declares that a South Arabic\r\ndialect is of Midian, and El-Mas'údi (apud Schultens, pp.\r\n158-159) inserts a Midianite king among the rulers of Yemen. The\r\nlatter, however, is more probable than the former; it may be an\r\naccidental and individual, not a material occurrence.\r\n\r\nThe following list of ruins, some cities, others towns, were all,\r\nwith two exceptions (Nos. 2 and 18), visited or explored by the\r\nsecond Khedivial Expedition. The Mashghal, ateliers or subsidiary\r\nworkshops, were in cases learned only by hearsay:--\r\n\r\n1. Old 'Akabah (Aylah) Mashghal, up Valley el-Yitm. 3.\r\n\r\n2. El-Hakl (pronounced \"Hagul\"), the <Greek>       of Ptolemy: it\r\nwas seen from the sea, and notes were taken of its ruins and\r\nfurnaces.\r\n\r\n3. Nakhil Tayyib Ism, in mountain of the same name: its ruined\r\ndam (?) and buildings were surveyed by Lieutenant Amir.\r\n\r\n4. Makná. Twice visited.\r\n\r\n5. Magháir Shu'ayb. Two ateliers inspected, and one heard of on\r\nthe Jebel el-Lauz: total, 3.\r\n\r\n6. 'Aynúnah. In Jebel Zahd (ruins and furnaces). 1.\r\n\r\n7. Sharmá. An atelier on the Jebel Fás, and another on the Jebel\r\nHarb, both high up: total, 2.\r\n\r\n8. Tiryam. An atelier in the Wady Urnub. 1.\r\n\r\n9. Abu Hawáwít, near El-Muwaylah. Scoriæ found about the fort of\r\nEl-Muwaylah and near Sharm Yáhárr. 2.\r\n\r\n10. Zibayyib in Wady Surr. Atelier Sayl Umm Laban (Wady Sadr). 1.\r\n\r\n11. Khulasah.[EN#83] Saw specimens of worked metal from Wady\r\nKh'shabríyyah, and the upper Wady Surr; also ruins in the Sayl\r\nAbú Sha'r, south-west and seawards of the Shárr block.\r\n\r\n12. Ma' el-Badá, alias Diyár el-Nasárá, in the upper Wady Dámah.\r\n\r\n13. Shuwák, the <Greek> of Ptolemy. Atelier in Jebel\r\nel-Sání. 1.\r\n\r\n14. Shaghab, another large city mentioned by El-Makrízi.\r\n\r\n15. Ruins of El-Khandakí. Broken quartz, and made road at\r\nEl-Kutayyifah; two other ateliers in Wady Ruways to the west:\r\ntotal, 3.\r\n\r\n16. Umm Amil. Near it an atelier still called El-Dayr, or the\r\nConvent. 1.\r\n\r\n17. Ziba', old town; Umm Jirmah to the north. 1.\r\n\r\n18. Majirmah (pronounced M'jirmah), one day's march south of\r\nZibá. Large ruins, supposed to have been the classical\r\nRhaunathos.\r\n\r\nThus, besides a total of eighteen ruins, more or less extensive,\r\ntwenty ateliers were seen or heard of; making up a total of\r\nthirty-eight--not far removed from the forty traditional\r\nsettlements of the mediæval Arab geographers.\r\n\r\nIn the plateau of New Red Sandstone called El-Hismá, ruins and\r\ninscriptions are said to be found at the Jebel Rawiyán, whose\r\nWady is mentioned by Wallin (p. 308); at Ruáfá, between the two\r\nhills El-Rakhamatayn; and at sundry other places, which we were\r\nunable to visit. Beyond the Hisma' I also collected notices of\r\nEl-Karáyyá, large ruins first alluded to by Wallin (p.\r\n316).[EN#84]\r\n\r\nDuring our exploration of the region below El-Muwaylah (my\r\nSouthern Midian), and our cruise to El-Haura', the following\r\nsites were either seen or reported:--\r\n\r\n1. Ruins in the Wady Dukhán, south of the Wady el-Azlam: north of\r\nEl-Wijh.\r\n\r\n2. El-Nabaghah, in the Wady el-Marrah: north of El-Wijh.\r\n\r\n3. Ruins, furnaces and quartz-strews, in the Fara't Lebayyiz.\r\n\r\n4. El-Wijh, the port of Strabo's \"Egra\" (?).\r\n\r\n5. Inland fort of El-Wijh; an old metal-working ground.\r\n\r\n6. The great mine and ruins, Umm el-Karayya't, everywhere\r\nsurrounded by ateliers.\r\n\r\n7. El-Kubbah, a small isolated ruin to the east of No. 6.\r\n\r\n8. El-Khaur, a working-place to the west of No. 6.\r\n\r\n9. The large works called Umm el-Hara'b, with two ruined ateliers\r\nnear them.\r\n\r\n10. Aba'l-Gezáz, a working-place in the watercourse of the same\r\nname, an upper branch of the Wady Salbah.\r\n\r\n11. The fine plain of Bada', with the Mashghal el-'Arayfát heard\r\nof to the north.\r\n\r\n12. Marwát, ruins on a ridge near Badá, and signs of a settlement\r\nin the valley. In the Wady Laylah, remains also spoken of.\r\n\r\n13. Aba'l-Marú, probably the Zu'l-Marwah of Bilázurí; extensive\r\nremains of buildings; a huge reef of quartz, carefully worked,\r\nand smaller ruins further down the valley.\r\n\r\n14. The classical temple or tomb on the left bank of the great\r\nWady Hamz, dividing Southern Midian from El-Hejaz in the Turkish\r\ndominions.\r\n\r\n15. Large remains, in two divisions, at El-Haurá.[EN#85]\r\n\r\nConcerning the ateliers, details will be found in the following\r\npages. Many of them suggest a kind of compromise between the\r\ncamps and settlements of the Stone Age, where, e.g. at Pressigny\r\nand Grimes' Graves, the only remnant of man is a vast strew of\r\nworked silexes; and the wandering fraternity of Freemasons who\r\nhutted themselves near the work in hand. And I would here lay\r\nspecial stress upon my suspicion that the ancestors of the\r\ndespised Hutaym may have been the Gypsy-caste that worked the\r\nmetals in Midian.\r\n\r\nFor the date of the many ruins which stud the country, I will\r\nassume empirically that their destruction is coeval with that of\r\nthe Christian Churches in Negeb, or the South Country,[EN#86]\r\nthat adjoins Midian Proper on the north-west. It may date from\r\neither the invasion of Khusrau Anúshírawán, the conquering\r\nSassanian King Chosroes (A.D. 531-579); or from the expedition,\r\nsent by the Caliph Omar and his successors, beginning in A.D.\r\n651. But, as will appear in the course of these pages, there was\r\na second destruction; and that evidently dates from the early\r\nsixteenth century, when Sultán Selim laid out his maritime road\r\nfor the Hajj-caravan. Before that time the Egyptian caravans, as\r\nwill be seen, marched inland, and often passed from Midian to\r\nEl-Hijr.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Chapter V.\r\n         Work At, and Excursions From, Magháir Shu'Ayb.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the blessing of Nebi Shu'ayb and a glance from his eyrie, I at\r\nonce suspected that the western Shigd was the \"Mountain on a\r\nmountain\" alluded to by Haji Wali;[EN#87] and, on January 12,\r\n1878, I ascertained that such was the case. The old man had given\r\nme a hand-sketch of the most artless, showing a gorge between two\r\nrocks, a hill of two stages to the left or west, and a couple of\r\nWadys draining it to the sea; one (Wady Makná) trending\r\nnorthwest, and the other (Wady 'Afál) south-west. The word\r\n\"Ishmah,\" affixed to the northern part of the route, is evidently\r\nthe Hismá plateau, and not, as I had supposed it to be, the Jebel\r\nTayyib Ism.\r\n\r\nNor had we any difficulty in discovering Haji Wali's tree, a\r\nsolitary Mimosa to the right of the caravan-track, springing from\r\nthe sands of the Shigdawayn gorge. The latter is formed by the\r\nsister-blocks before alluded to. The western Shigd, on the right\r\nof the Wady 'Afál, is composed of carbonate of lime and\r\nsandstones dyed with manganese, the whole resting upon a core of\r\ngrey granite; the formation is the same as the eastern feature,\r\nbut the lines of the latter are gentler, and the culminating\r\ntower is wanting.\r\n\r\nThe western Shigd, indeed, is sufficiently peculiar. It is the\r\nsouthern apex of a short range, numbering some four heads: the\r\neastern flank discharges the Wady Kizáz, which feeds the 'Afál;\r\nand the western the Wady Makná. The summit of the broken and\r\nspiny cone is a huge perpendicular block, apparently inaccessible\r\nas a tower, and composed of the dull yellow ferruginous\r\nconglomerate called \"El-Safrá:\" the tint contrasts strongly with\r\na long line of bright white Rugham (gypsum), bisecting the head\r\nof the Wady Makná. Below the apex is a thick stratum of\r\nmanganese-stained rock: the upper line, with a dip of 15 deg.\r\ntowards the main valley, looks much like a row of bulwarks which\r\nhad slipped from the horizontal, while still bluff between the\r\nnorth-east and east. Indeed, the shape is so regular that M.\r\nLacaze, at first sight, asked if it was une construction.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the washing-trough was brought up from Sharmá, we\r\nopened operations by digging a trench, at least twelve feet deep,\r\nin the re-entering angle of the bed close to the Mimosa tree. The\r\nsand, pink above and chloritic yellow below, ended in a thick bed\r\nof water-rolled pebbles, not in ground-rock; nor did it show the\r\ncouch of excellent clay which usually underlies the surface, and\r\nwhich, I have said, is extracted through pits to make sun-dried\r\nbrick, swish, and other building materials. We also secured some\r\nof the blood-red earth from the eastern tail of the northern\r\n\"Shigh,\" the manganese-stained Tauá and the gravelly sand washed\r\nout of the Cascalho-gravel, the latter very promising. The result\r\nof our careless working, however, was not successful; the normal\r\nilmenite, black sand of magnetic iron, took the place of\r\ngold-dust. And this unlooked-for end again made us suspicious of\r\nmy old friend's proceedings: the first occasion was that of his\r\nnotable \"malingering.\" Had he bought a pinch of \"Tibr\" (pure\r\ngold) from the Bedawin, and mixed it with the handful of surface\r\nstuff ? Had the assayer at Alexandria played him a trick ? Or had\r\nan exceptionally heavy torrent really washed down auriferous\r\n\"tailings\"? I willingly believe the latter to have been the case;\r\nand we shall presently see it is within the range of possibility.\r\nTraces of gold were found by Lieutenant-Colonel W. A. Ross,\r\nthrough his pyrological process, in the sandy clays brought from\r\nthe mouth of Wady Makná.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, despite our magnificent offers, the Arabs managed to\r\nkeep inviolate their secret--if they had one. An old man, now a\r\nrich merchant and householder at Suez, had repeatedly declared to\r\nMr. A. G. K. Levick, that in his young days the Bedawin washed\r\ngold in Midian, till the industry fell into disrepute. During my\r\nlast visit he was unfortunately absent upon a pilgrimage; after\r\nour return he asserted that he had sent for specimens of the\r\nsand, but that it paid too little even for transport. This 'Abd\r\nel-Hámid el-Shámi, interviewed, after our return, by Mr. Clarke,\r\ndeclared more than once, and still declares, that many years ago\r\nhe obtained from the Wady Zibá, behind the settlement, a certain\r\nquantity of reddish sand which appeared auriferous. He roasted\r\nand washed the contents of three small baskets called\r\n\"Coffas\"[EN#88] by Europeans; and this yielded a pinch of \"what\r\nlooked like pure gold.\"\r\n\r\nIn camp our men spoke freely of Tibr stored in quills, carried\r\nbehind the ear, and sold at Suez--not at Cairo for fear of\r\nconsequences. Yet neither promises nor bribes would persuade the\r\npoorest to break through the rule of silence. The whole might\r\nhave been a canard: on the other hand, there was also a valid\r\nreason for reticence; the open mouth would not long have led to a\r\nsound throat. So our many informants contented themselves with\r\ntelling us frequent tales of gold ornaments picked up after rain;\r\nthey showed us a ring made from a bit found on the Tabúk road,\r\nand they invariably assure us that we shall find wondrous\r\nthings--about the next station.\r\n\r\nAt Magháir Shu'ayb we wasted a whole fortnight (January 11-24,\r\n1878) in vain works; and I afterwards bitterly repented that the\r\ntime had not been given to South Midian. Yet the delay was\r\npleasant enough, after the month which is required to acquire, or\r\nto recover, the habit of tent-life. The halting-day was mostly\r\nspent as follows: At six a.m., and somewhat later on cold\r\nmornings, the Boruji sounds his réveillé--Kum, yá Habíbí, sáh\r\nel-Naum (\"Rise, friend! sleep is done\"), as the Egyptian officers\r\ninterpret the call. A curious business he makes of it, when his\r\nfingers are half frozen; yet Bugler Mersál Abú Dunya is a man of\r\nambition, who persistently, and despite the coarse laughter of\r\nEuropeans, repairs for quiet practicing to the bush. We drink tea\r\nor coffee made by Engineer Ali Marie, or by Quartermaster Yusuf,\r\nnot by Europeans; two camels supply us with sweet milk; butter we\r\nhave brought; and nothing is wanted for complete comfort but\r\nbread.\r\n\r\nWe then separate to our work, after telling off the quarrymen to\r\ntheir several tasks. Inveterate idlers and ne'er-do-weels, their\r\nonly object in life is not to labour; a dozen of them will pass a\r\nday in breaking ten pounds' weight of stone. They pound in the\r\nstyle of the Eastern tobacconist, with a very short stroke and a\r\nvery long stay. At last they burst the sieves in order to enjoy a\r\nquieter life. They will do nothing without superintendence;\r\nwhilst the officer is absent they sit and chat, smoke, or lie\r\ndown to rest; and they are never to be entrusted with a\r\nwater-skin or a bottle of spirits. The fellows will station one\r\nof their number on the nearest hill, whilst their comrades enjoy\r\na sounder sleep; they are the greatest of cowards, and yet none\r\nwould thus have acted sentinel even in the presence of the enemy.\r\nThese useful articles all expect a liberal \"bakhshísh\" when the\r\njourney is done, with the usual Asiatic feeling: they know that\r\nthey deserve nothing, but my \"dignity\" obliges me to largess. On\r\nthis occasion it did not.\r\n\r\nThose told off to dig prefer to make a deep pit, because fewer\r\ncan work together at it, rather than scrape off and sift the two\r\nfeet of surface which yield \"antíka's.\" They rob what they can:\r\nevery scrap of metal stylus, manilla, or ring is carefully\r\ntested, scraped, broken or filed, in order to see whether it be\r\ngold. Punishment is plentifully administered, but in vain; we\r\ncannot even cure their unclean habits of washing in and polluting\r\nthe fountain source. Three Europeans would easily do the work of\r\nthese thirty poor devils.\r\n\r\nMr. Clarke is our camp-manager in general: he is also our jäger;\r\nhe shoots the wild poultry, duck and partridge, sand-grouse, and\r\n\"Bob White\" the quail, for half our dinners; and the Arabs call\r\nhim the \"Angel of Death belonging to the Birds.\" He failed to\r\nsecure a noble eagle in the Wady 'Afál, whose nest was built upon\r\nan inaccessible cliff: he described the bird as standing as high\r\nas our table, and with a width of six to seven feet from wing to\r\nwing. He also brought tidings of a large (horned?) owl, possibly\r\nthe same species as the fine bird noted at Sinai. The Arabs call\r\nit classically Búmah, and vulgarly Umm Kuwayk (\"Mother of\r\nSqueaking\"): the Fellahin believe that it sucks out children's\r\neyes, and hence their name, \"Massásah.\" Here, as in the Sinaitic\r\nPeninsula, \"the owl and the hyena are used as charms; and the\r\nburnt feathers of the former, and the boiled flesh of the latter\r\n(superior filth!), are considered as infallible specifics for\r\nnumerous disorders.\" In other parts of Arabia the hooting of the\r\nowl portends death; and the cry, Fát--fát, is interpreted, \"He is\r\ngone, gone.\"\r\n\r\nThe two Staff-officers make plans and sketches of the new places,\r\nor they protract their field-books, working very hard and very\r\nslowly. I have but little confidence in their route-surveys:\r\nsights are taken from mule-back, and distances are judged by the\r\neye. True, the protractions come out well, but this is all the\r\nworse, suggesting the process commonly called \"doctoring.\" For\r\nthe style of thing, however, \"dead reckoning\" did well enough.\r\n\r\nM. Lacaze is the most ardent. Accompanied by his favourite\r\norderly, Salámat el-Nahhás, an intelligent negro from Dár-For, he\r\nsets out after breakfast with a bit of bread, a flagon of water,\r\na tent-umbrella, and his tools, which he loses with remarkable\r\npunctuality, to spend the whole day sketching, painting, and\r\nphotographing. M. Philipin is our useful man: he superintends the\r\nwashing-cradle; he wanders far and wide, gun in hand, bringing us\r\nspecimens of everything that strikes the eye; and he is great at\r\nhis forge: the Bedawin sit for hours, gazing attentively as he\r\nconverts a file into a knife, and illustrating the reverence with\r\nwhich, in early days, men regarded Vulcan and Wayland Smith.\r\n\r\nAt eleven a.m. the bugle sounds Tijrí taakul! (\"Run and feed\"), a\r\nsignal for déjeuner à la fourchette. It is a soup, a stew, and a\r\nPuláo (\"pilaff\") of rice and meat, sheep or goat, the only\r\nprovisions that poor Midian can afford, accompanied by onions and\r\ngarlic, which are eaten like apples, washed down with bon\r\nordinaire; followed by cheese when we have it, and ending with\r\ntea or coffee. George the cook proves himself an excellent man\r\nwhen deprived of oil and undemoralized by contact with his fellow\r\nGreeks. After feeding, the idlers, who have slumbered, or rather\r\nhave remained in bed, between eight p.m. and six to seven a.m.,\r\ngenerally manage a couple of hours' siesta, loudly declaring that\r\nthey have been wide awake. One of the party seems to live by the\r\nblessing of him who invented sleep, and he is always good for\r\nhalf of the twenty-four hours--how they must envy him whose\r\nunhappy brains can be stupefied only by poisonous chloral!\r\n\r\nAt two p.m., after drinking tea or coffee once more, we proceed\r\nto another four hours' spell of work. As sunset and the cold\r\nhours draw near, all assemble about the fire, generally two or\r\nthree huge palm trunks, whose blaze gladdens the soul of the\r\nlonely night-sentinel; and, assembling the Shaykhs of the Arabs,\r\nwe gather from them information geographical, historical, and\r\nethnological. The amount of invention, of pure fancy, of airy\r\nlying, is truly sensational; while at the same time they conceal\r\nfrom us everything they can; and, more especially, everything we\r\nmost wish to know. Firstly, they do not want us to spy out the\r\nsecrets of the land; and, secondly, they count upon fleecing us\r\nthrough another season. During the whole day, but notably at this\r\nhour, we have the normal distractions of the Arabian journey. One\r\nman brings, and expects \"bakhshísh\" for, a bit of broken metal or\r\nsome ridiculous stone; another grumbles for meat; and a third\r\nwants tobacco, medicine, or something to be had for the asking. I\r\nam careful to pay liberally, as by so doing the country is well\r\nscoured.\r\n\r\nDinner, at seven p.m., is a copy of what was served before noon.\r\nIt is followed by another sitting round the fire, which is built\r\ninside the mess tent when cold compels. At times the conversation\r\nlasts till midnight; and, when cognac or whisky is plentiful, I\r\nhave heard it abut upon the Battle of Waterloo and the\r\nImmortality of the Soul. Piquet and écarté are reserved for life\r\non board ship. Our only reading consists of newspapers, which\r\ncome by camel post every three weeks; and a few \"Tauchnitz,\"\r\noften odd volumes. I marvel, as much as Hamlet ever did, to see\r\nthe passionate influence of the storyteller upon those full-grown\r\nchildren, bearded men; to find them, in the midst of this wild\r\nnew nature, so utterly absorbed by the fictitious weal and woe of\r\nsome poor creature of the author's brain, that they neglect even\r\nwhat they call their \"meals ;\" allow their \"teas\" to cool, and\r\nstrain their eyesight poring over page after page in the dim\r\nlight of a rusty lantern. Thus also the Egyptian, after sitting\r\nin his café with all his ears and eyes opened their widest,\r\nwhilst the story-teller drones out the old tale of Abú Zayd, will\r\ndispute till midnight, and walk home disputing about what, under\r\nsuch and such circumstances, they themselves would have done. To\r\nme the main use of \"Tauchnitz\" was to make Arabia appear the\r\nhappier, by viewing, from the calm vantage-ground of the Desert,\r\nthe meanness and the littlenesses of civilized life--in novels.\r\n\r\nThe marching-day is only the halting-day in movement. By seven\r\na.m. in winter and four a.m. in spring, we have breakfasted and\r\nare ready to mount mule or dromedary; more generally, however, we\r\nset out, accompanied by the Sayyid and the Shaykhs, for a morning\r\nwalk. The tents and, most important of all, the tent-table are\r\nleft to follow under the charge of the Egyptian officers, who\r\nallow no dawdling. With us are the cook and the two\r\nbody-servants, riding of course: they carry meat, drink, and\r\ntobacco in my big tin cylinder intended to collect plants; and\r\nthey prefer to give us cold whilst we fight for hot breakfasts.\r\nAfter resting between ten a.m. and noon in some shady spot,\r\ngenerally under a thorn, we ride on to the camping-ground, which\r\nwe reach between two and three p.m. This is the worst part of the\r\nday for man and beast, especially for the mules--hence the\r\nnecessity of early rising.\r\n\r\nThe average work rarely exceeds six hours (= eighteen to twenty\r\nmiles). Even this, if kept up day after day, is hard labour for\r\nour montures, venerable animals whose chests, galled by the\r\nbreast-straps, show that they have not been broken to the saddle.\r\nAccustomed through life to ply in a state of semi-somnolence,\r\nbetween Cairo and the Citadel, they begin by proving how\r\nunintelligent want of education can make one of the most\r\nintelligent of beasts. They trip over every pebble, and are\r\nalmost useless on rough and broken ground; they start and swerve\r\nat a man, a tree, a rock, a distant view or a glimpse of the sea;\r\nthey will not leave one another, and they indulge their pet\r\ndislikes: this shies at a camel, that kicks at a dog. Presently\r\nTamaddun, as the Arabs say, \"urbanity,\" or, more literally, being\r\n\"citified,\" asserts itself, as in the human cockney; and at last\r\nthey become cleverer and more knowing than any country-bred. They\r\nclimb up the ladders of stone with marvellous caution, and slip\r\ndown the slopes of sand on their haunches; they round every\r\nrat-hole which would admit a hoof; and they know better than we\r\ndo where water is. They are not always well treated; the\r\n\"galloping griff\" is amongst us, who enjoys \"lambing\" and\r\n\"bucketing\" even a half-donkey. Of course, the more sensible\r\nanimal of the two is knocked up; whilst the rider assumes the\r\nairs of one versed in the haute école. The only difficulty, by no\r\nfault of the mules, was the matter of irons: shoeless they could\r\ntravel only in sand; and, as has been said, the farrier was\r\nforgotten.\r\n\r\nAmongst our recreant Shaykhs I must not include Furayj bin Rafí'a\r\nel-Huwaytí, a man of whom any tribe might be proud, and a living\r\nproof that the Bedawi may still be a true gentleman. A short\r\nfigure, meagre of course, as becomes the denizen of the Desert,\r\nbut \"hard as nails,\" he has straight comely features, a clean\r\ndark skin, and a comparatively full beard, already, like his\r\nhair, waxing white, although he cannot be forty-five. A bullet in\r\nthe back, and both hands distorted by sabre-cuts, attempts at\r\nassassination due to his own kin, do not prevent his using sword,\r\ngun, and pistol. He is the 'Agíd of the tribe, the African\r\n\"Captain of War;\" as opposed to the civil authority, the Shayhk,\r\nand to the judicial, the Kázi. At first it is somewhat startling\r\nto hear him prescribe a slit weasand as a cure for lying; yet he\r\nseems to be known, loved, and respected by all around him,\r\nincluding his hereditary foes, the Ma'ázah. He is the only Bedawi\r\nin camp who prays. Naturally he is a genealogist, rich in local\r\nlore. He counteracts all the intrigues by which that rat-faced\r\nlittle rascal, Shaykh Hasan el-'Ukbi, tries to breed mischief\r\nbetween friends. He is a walking map; it would be easy to draw up\r\na rude plan of the country from his information. He does not know\r\nhours and miles, but he can tell to a nicety the comparative\r\nlength of a march; and, when ignorant, he has the courage to say\r\nM'adri, \"don't know.\" He never asked me for anything, nor told a\r\nlie, nor even hid a water-hole. Willing and ready to undertake\r\nthe longest march, the hardest work, his word is Házir--\"I'm\r\nhere\"--and he will even walk to mount a tired man. Seated upon\r\nhis loud-voiced little Hijn,[EN#89] remarkable because it is of\r\nthe noble Bishári strain, bred between the Nile and the Red Sea,\r\nhe is ever the guide in chief. At last it ends with Nádi Shaykh\r\nFurayj!--\"Call Shaykh Furayj\"--when anything is to be done, to be\r\nexplained, to be discovered. I would willingly have recommended\r\nhim for the chieftainship of his tribe, but he is not wealthy; he\r\nwisely prefers to see the dignity in the hands of his cousin\r\n'Alayán, who, by-the-by, is helpless without him. He remained\r\nwith us to the end: he seemed to take a pride in accompanying the\r\nexpedition by sea to El-Haurá, and by land to the Wady Hamz, far\r\nbeyond the limits of his tribe. When derided for mounting a pair\r\nof Government \"bluchers,\" tied over bare feet, with bits of\r\nglaring tassel-string from his camel-saddle, he quoted the\r\nproverb, \"Whoso liveth with a people forty days becomes of them.\"\r\nWe parted after the most friendly adieu, or rather au revoir, and\r\nhe was delighted with some small gifts of useful weapons:--I\r\nwonder whether Shaykh Furayj will prove \"milk,\" to use Sir Walter\r\nScott's phrase, \"which can stand more than one skimming.\"\r\n\r\nIn such wild travel, the traveller's comfort depends mainly upon\r\nweather. Usually the air of Magháir Shu'ayb was keen, pure, and\r\ninvigorating, with a distinct alternation of land-breeze by\r\nnight, and of sea-breeze by day. Nothing could be more charming\r\nthan the flushing of the mountains at sunrise and sunset, and the\r\nmagnificence of the windy, wintry noon. The rocky spires,\r\npinnacles, and domes, glowing with gorgeous golden light, and the\r\nlower ranges, shaded with hazy blue, umber-red, and luminous\r\npurple, fell into picture and formed prospects indescribably pure\r\nand pellucid. But the average of the aneroid (29.19) gave an\r\naltitude of eight hundred feet; and even in this submaritime\r\nregion, the minimum temperature was 42 deg. F., ranging to a\r\nmaximum of 85 deg F. in the shade. These are extremes which the\r\nsoft Egyptian body, reared in the house or the hut, could hardly\r\nsupport.\r\n\r\nDarwaysh Effendi followed suit after Yusuf Effendi; it was a\r\nstudy to see him swathed to the nose, bundled in the thickest\r\nclothes, with an umbrella opened against the sun, and with a\r\nsoldier leading his staid old mule. Bukhayt Ahmar and several of\r\nthe soldiers were laid up; Ahmed Kaptán was incapacitated for\r\nwork by an old and inveterate hernia, the effect, he said, of\r\nriding his violent little beast; and a sound ague and fever,\r\nwhich continued three days, obliterated in my own case the last\r\nevils of Karlsbad. We had one night of rain (January 15),\r\nbeginning gently at 2.30 a.m., and ending in a heavy\r\ndownfall--unfortunately a pluviometer was one of the forgotten\r\narticles. Before the shower, earth was dry as a bone; shortly\r\nafter it, sprouts of the greenest grass began to appear in the\r\nlow places, and under the shadow of the perennial shrubs. The\r\ncold damp seemed to make even the snakes torpid: for the first\r\ntime in my life I trod upon one--a clairvoyante having already\r\nwarned me against serpents and scorpions. There were also bursts\r\nof heat, ending in the normal three grey days of raw piercing\r\nnorther; and followed by a still warmer spell. Upon the Gulf of\r\nEl-'Akabah a violent gale was blowing. On the whole the winter\r\nclimate of inland Midian is trying, and a speedy return to the\r\nseaboard air is at times advisable, while South Midian feels like\r\nThebes after Cairo. The coast climate is simply perfect, save and\r\nexcept when El-Aylí, the storm-wind from 'Akabat Aylah, is\r\nabroad. My meteorological journal was carefully kept, despite the\r\nimperfection of the instruments. Mr. Clarke registered the\r\nobservations during my illness; Mr. Duguid and Násir Kaptán made\r\nsimultaneous observations on board the ships; and Dr. Maclean\r\nkindly corrected the instrumental errors after our return to\r\nCairo.[EN#90]\r\n\r\nI had proposed to march upon the Hismá, or sandy plateau to the\r\neast, which can be made from Magháir Shu'ayb without the\r\nmortification of a Nakb, or ladder of stone. Thereupon our\r\nTagaygát-Huwaytát Shaykhs and camel-men began to express great\r\nfear of the 'Imran-Huwaytát, refusing to enter their lands\r\nwithout express leave and the presence of a Ghafír (\"surety\").\r\nOur caravan-leader, the gallant Sayyid, at once set off in search\r\nof 'Brahim bin Makbúl, second chief of the 'Imrán, and recognized\r\nby the Egyptian Government as the avocat, spokesman and\r\ndiplomatist, the liar and intriguer of his tribe. This man was\r\nfound near El-Hakl (Hagul), two long marches ahead: he came in\r\nreadily enough, holding in hand my kerchief as a pledge of\r\nprotection, and accompanied by three petty chiefs, Musallam,\r\nSa'd, and Muhaysin, all with an eye to \"bakhshísh.\" In fact,\r\nevery naked-footed \"cousin,\" a little above the average clansman,\r\nwould call himself a Shaykh, and claim his Musháhirah, or monthly\r\npay; not a cateran came near us but affected to hold himself\r\ndishonoured if not provided at once with the regular salary.\r\n'Brahim was wholly beardless, and our Egyptians quoted their\r\nproverb, Sabáh el-Kurúd, wa lá Sabán el-'Ajrúd--\"Better (see\r\nill-omened) monkeys in the morning than the beardless man.\" As\r\nthe corruption of the best turns to the worst, so the Bedawi, a\r\nnoble race in its own wilds, becomes thoroughly degraded by\r\ncontact with civilization. I remember a certain chief of the Wuld\r\nAli tribe, near Damascus, who was made a Freemason at Bayrút, and\r\nthe result was that \"brother\" Mohammed became a model villain.\r\n\r\nBy way of payment for escort and conveyance to the Hismá, 'Brahim\r\nexpected a recognition of his claim upon the soil of Magháir\r\nShu'ayb, which belongs to the wretched Masá'id. He held the true\r\nIshmaelitic tenet, that as Sayyidná (our Lord) Ádam had died\r\nintestate, so all men (Arabs) have a right to all things,\r\nprovided the right can be established by might. Hence the saying\r\nof the Fellah, \"Shun the Arab and the itch.\" Thus encouraged by\r\nthe Shaykhs, the \"dodges\" of the clansmen became as manifold as\r\nthey were palpable. They wanted us to pay for camping-ground;\r\nthey complained aloud when we cut a palm-frond for palms, or used\r\na rotten fallen trunk for fuel. They made their sheep appear fat\r\nby drenching them with water. The people of the Fort el-Muwaylah,\r\ndetermined not to déroger, sent to us, for sale, the eggs laid by\r\nour own fowls. And so forth.\r\n\r\nPresently 'Brahim brought in his elder brother, Khizr bin Makbúl,\r\nabout as ill-conditioned a \"cuss\" as himself. Very dark, with the\r\nleft eye clean gone, this worthy appeared pretentiously dressed\r\nin the pink of Desert fashion--a scarlet cloak, sheepskin-lined,\r\nand bearing a huge patch of blue cloth between the shoulders; a\r\ncrimson caftan, and red morocco boots with irons resembling\r\nice-cramps at the heels. Like 'Brahim, he uses his Bákúr, or\r\ncrooked stick, to trace lines and dots upon the ground;\r\nsimilarly, the Yankee whittles to hide the trick that lurks in\r\nhis eyes. Khizr tents in the Hismá, and his manners are wild and\r\nrough as his dwelling-place; possibly manly, brusque certainly,\r\nlike the Desert Druzes of the Jebel Haurán. He paid his first\r\nvisit when our Shaykhs were being operated upon by the\r\nphotographer: I fancied that such a novelty would have attracted\r\nhis attention for the moment. But no: his first question was,\r\nAysh 'Ujratí?--\"What is the hire for my camels?\" Finally, these\r\nmen threw so many difficulties in our way, that I was compelled\r\nto defer our exploration of the eastern region to a later day.\r\n\r\nAfter a week of washing for metals at Magháir Shu'ayb, it was\r\ntime to move further afield. On January 17th, the Egyptian\r\nStaff-officers rode up the Wady 'Afál, and beyond the two\r\npyramidal rocks of white stone, which have fallen from the\r\ntowered \"Shigd,\" they found on its right bank the ruins of a\r\nsmall atelier. It lies nearly opposite the mouth of the Wady\r\nTafrígh, which is bounded north by a hill of the same name; and\r\nsouth by the lesser \"Shigd.\" Beyond it comes the Wady Nimir, the\r\nbroad drain of the Jibál el-Nimir, \"Hills of the Leopard,\"\r\nfeeding the 'Afál: the upper valley is said to have water and\r\npalms. After a \"leg\" to the north-east (45 deg. mag.), they found\r\nthe 'Afál running from due north; and one hour (= three miles)\r\nled them to other ruins on the eastern side of the low hills that\r\nprolong to the north the greater \"Shigd.\" The names of both sites\r\nwere unknown even to Shaykh Furayj. The foundations of uncut\r\nboulders showed a semicircle of buildings measuring 229 paces\r\nacross the horseshoe. They counted eleven tenements--probably\r\noccupied by the slave-owners and superintendents--squares and\r\noblongs, separated by intervals of from forty-five to\r\nninety-seven or a hundred paces. On the north-north-east lay the\r\nchief furnace, a parallelogram of some twenty-three paces, built\r\nof stone and surrounded by scatters of broken white quartz and\r\nscoriæ. These two workshops seem to argue that the country was\r\nformerly much better watered than it is now. Moreover, it\r\nconvinced me that the only rock regularly treated by the\r\nancients, in this region, was the metallic Marú (quartz).\r\n\r\n\r\nI had heard by mere chance of a \"White Mountain,\" at no great\r\ndistance, in the mass of hills bounding to the north the\r\nSecondary formations of Magháir Shu'ayb. On January 21st, M.\r\nMarie and Lieutenant Amir were detached to inspect it. They were\r\nguided by the active Furayj and a Bedawi lad, Hamdán of the\r\nAmírát, who on receiving a \"stone dollar\" (i.e. silver) could not\r\nunderstand its use. Travelling in a general northern direction,\r\nthe little party reached their destination in about three hours\r\n(= nine miles). They found some difficulty in threading a mile\r\nand a quarter of very ugly road, a Nakb, passing through rocks\r\nglittering with mica; a ladder of stony steps and overfalls, with\r\nangles and zigzags where camels can carry only half-loads. The\r\nEuropean dismounted; the Egyptian, who was firm in the saddle,\r\nrode his mule the whole way. We afterwards, however, explored a\r\ncomparatively good road, viâ the Wady Murákh, to the seaboard,\r\nwhich will spare the future metal-smelter much trouble and\r\nexpense.\r\n\r\nThe quartz mountain is, like almost all the others, the expanded\r\nmushroom-like head of a huge filon or vein; and minor filets\r\nthread all the neighbouring heights. The latter are the\r\nfoot-hills of the great Jebel Zánah, a towering, dark, and\r\ndome-shaped mass clearly visible from Magháir Shu'ayb. This\r\nremarkable block appeared to me the tallest we had hitherto seen;\r\nit is probably the \"Tayyibat Ism, 6000,\" of the Hydrographic\r\nChart. The travellers ascended the Jebel el-Marú, trembling the\r\nwhile with cold; and from its summit, some fifteen hundred feet\r\nabove sea-level, they had a grand view of the seaboard and the\r\nsea. They brought home specimens of the rock, and fondly fancied\r\nthat they had struck gold: it was again that abominable\r\n\"crow-gold\" (pyrites), which has played the unwary traveller so\r\nmany a foul practical joke.\r\n\r\nDuring our stay at Magháir Shu'ayb the camp had been much excited\r\nby Bedawi reports of many marvels in the lands to the north and\r\nthe north-east. The Arabs soon learned to think that everything\r\nwas worth showing: they led M. Lacaze for long miles to a rock\r\nwhere bees were hiving. A half-naked 'Umayri shepherd, one Suwayd\r\nbin Sa'íd, had told us of a Hajar masdúd (\"closed stone\") about\r\nthe size of a tent, with another of darker colour set in it; the\r\nArabs had been unable to break it open, but they succeeded with a\r\nsimilar rock in the Hismá, finding inside only Tibn (\"tribulated\r\nstraw\") and charcoal. Another had seen a Kidr Dahab (\"golden\r\npot\"), in the 'Aligán section of the Wady el-Hakl (Hagul) where\r\nit leaves the Hismá; and a matchlock-man had brought down with\r\nhis bullet a bit of precious metal from the upper part. This\r\nreport prevails in many places: it may have come all the way from\r\n\"Pharaoh's Treasury\" at Petra, or from the Sinaitic Wady Lejá. At\r\nthe mouth of the latter is the Hajar el-Kidr (\"Potrock\"), which\r\nevery passing Arab either stones or strikes with his staff,\r\nhoping that the mysterious utensil will burst and shed its golden\r\nshower. Moreover, a half-witted Ma'ázi, by name Masá'í, had\r\ntantalized us with a glorious account of the \"House of 'Antar\" in\r\nthe Hismá, and the cistern where that negro hero and poet used to\r\nwater his horses. Near its massive walls rises a Hazbah (\"steep\r\nand solitary hillock\") with Dims or layers of ashlar atop: he had\r\nactually broken off a bit of greenstone sticking in the masonry,\r\nand sold it to a man from Tor (Khwájeh Kostantin?) for a large\r\nsum--two napoleons, a new shirt, and a quantity of coffee. A\r\nsimilar story is found in the Bádiyat el-Tíh, the Desert north of\r\nthe Sinaitic Peninsula. At the ruined cairns of Khara'bat Lussán\r\n(the ancient Lysa), an Arab saw a glimmer of light proceeding\r\nfrom a bit of curiously cut stone. \"This he carried away with him\r\nand sold to a Christian at Jerusalem for three pounds.\"[EN#91]\r\n\r\nShaykh 'Brahím had also heard of this marvel; but he called it\r\nthe Haráb 'Antar (\"Ruin of 'Antar\"), and he placed it in the Wady\r\nel-Hakl, about an hour's ride south of the Wady 'Afál. Finally, a\r\ntablet in the Wady Hawwayi', adorned with a dragon and other\r\nanimals, was reported to me; and the memory of inscriptions\r\nmentioned in the Jihan-numá was still importunate. Evidently all\r\nthese were mere fancies; or, at best, gross distortions of facts.\r\nThe Bedawin repeat them in the forlorn hope of \"bakhshísh,\" and\r\nnever expect action to be taken: next morning they will probably\r\ndeclare the whole to be an invention. Yet it is never safe to\r\nneglect the cry of \"wolf\": our most remarkable discovery, the\r\nTemple at the Wady Hamz, was made when report promised least.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, on January 24th, I despatched, with Shaykhs Khizr\r\nand 'Brahím as guides, Mr. Clarke and the two Staff-lieutenants\r\ntowards El-Rijm, the next station of the pilgrim-caravan. Riding\r\nup the Wady 'Afál, they reached, after an hour and\r\nthree-quarters, the ruins known as Igár Muás--a name of truly\r\nbarbarous sound. The settlement had occupied both banks, but the\r\nprincipal mass was on the left: here two blocks, separated by a\r\nhillock, lay to north-east and south-west of each other.\r\nApparently dwelling-places, they were composed of a\r\nmasonry-cistern and of fourteen buildings, detached squares and\r\noblongs, irregular both in orientation and in size; the largest\r\nmeasuring eighty by fifty metres, and the smallest five by four.\r\nThe material was of water-rolled boulders, huge pebbles without\r\nmortar or cement. There were no signs of a furnace, nor were the\r\nusual fragments of glass and pottery strewed about. To the north\r\nand running up the north-north-eastern slope stood a line of wall\r\ntwo metres broad and three hundred long: it ended at the\r\nsouth-western extremity in five round towers razed to their\r\nfoundations. It was suggested that this formed part of a street,\r\nlaid out on the plan of the Jebel el-Safrá, the hauteville of\r\nMagháir Shu'ayb. On the right bank of the Wady appeared a heap of\r\nstones suggesting a Burj. Fine, hard, compact, and purple-blue\r\nslate was collected in the ruins; and the red conglomerates on\r\neither side of the watercourse suggested that Cascalho had been\r\nworked.\r\n\r\nAfter riding their dromedaries some three hours, halts not\r\nincluded, the travellers were asked why they had not brought\r\ntheir tents. \"Because we expect to return to camp this evening!\"\r\nThen it leaked out that they had not reached half-way to the\r\n\"closed stone,\" while the dragon-tablet would take a whole day.\r\nUnprepared for a wintry night in the open, some twelve hundred\r\nfeet above sea-level, they rode back at full speed, greatly to\r\nthe disgust of the Arabs, who, at this hungry season, rarely push\r\ntheir lean beasts beyond three and a half to four miles an hour.\r\nLieutenant Amir, who is invaluable in the field, would have\r\npressed forward: not so the European.\r\n\r\nI did not see Shaykhs Khizr or 'Brahím for many a day; nor did we\r\nattempt any more reconnaissances to the north of Magháir Shu'ayb.\r\n\r\nNot the least pleasant part of our evening's work was collecting\r\ninformation concerning the origin of the tribes inhabiting modern\r\nMidian; and, as on such occasions a mixed multitude was always\r\npresent, angry passions were often let rise. As my previous\r\nvolume showed, the tribes in this Egyptian corner of\r\nNorth-Western Arabia number three--the Huwaytát, the Maknáwi, and\r\nthe Beni 'Ukbah; the two former of late date, and all more or\r\nless connected with the Nile Valley. Amongst them I do not\r\ninclude the Hutaym or Hitaym, a tribe of Pariahs who, like the\r\nAkhdám (\"serviles\") of Maskat and Yemen, live scattered amongst,\r\nalthough never intermarrying with, their neighbours. As a rule\r\nthe numbers of all these tribes are grossly exaggerated, the\r\nobject being to impose upon the pilgrim-caravans, and to draw\r\nblack-mail from the Government of Egypt. The Huwaytát, for\r\ninstance, modestly declare that they can put 5000 matchlocks into\r\nthe field: I do not believe that they have 500. The Ma'ázah speak\r\nof 2000, which may be reduced in the same proportion; whilst the\r\nBaliyy have introduced their 37,000 into European books of\r\ngeography, when 370 would be nearer the mark. I anticipate no\r\ndifficulty in persuading these Egypto-Arabs to do a fair day's\r\nwork for a fair and moderate wage. The Bedawin flocked to the\r\nSuez Canal, took an active part in the diggings, and left a good\r\nname there. They will be as useful to the mines; and thus shall\r\nMidian escape the mortification of the \"red-flannel-shirted\r\nJove,\" while enjoying his golden shower.\r\n\r\nI first took the opportunity of rectifying my notes on the origin\r\nof the Huwayta't tribe.[EN#92] According to their own oral\r\ngenealogists, the first forefather was a lad called 'Alayán, who,\r\ntravelling in company with certain Shurafá (\"descendants of the\r\nApostle\"), and ergò held by his descendants to have been also a\r\nSherif, fell sick on the way. At El-'Akabah he was taken in\r\ncharge by 'Atíyyah, Shaykh of the then powerful Ma'ázah tribe,\r\nwho owned the land upon which the fort stands. A \"clerk,\" able to\r\nread and to write, he served his adopted father by superintending\r\nthe accounts of stores and provisions supplied to the Hajj. The\r\nArabs, who before that time embezzled at discretion, called him\r\nEl-Huwayti' (\"the Man of the Little Wall\") because his learning\r\nwas a fence against their frauds He was sent for by his Egyptian\r\nfriends; these, however, were satisfied by a false report of his\r\ndeath: he married his benefactor's daughter; he became Shaykh\r\nafter the demise of his father-in-law; he drove the Ma'ázah from\r\nEl-'Akabah, and he left four sons, the progenitors and eponymi of\r\nthe Midianite Huwaytát. Their names are 'Alwán, 'Imrán, Suway'id,\r\nand Sa'id; and the list of nineteen tribes, which I gave in \"The\r\nGold-Mines of Midian,\" is confined to the descendants of the\r\nthird brother.\r\n\r\nThe Huwaytát tribe is not only an intruder, it is also the\r\naggressive element in the Midianite family of Bedawin; and, of\r\nlate years, it has made great additions to its territory. If it\r\nadvances at the present rate it will, after a few generations,\r\neither \"eat up,\" as Africans say, all the other races or, by a\r\nmore peaceful process, assimilate them to its own body.\r\n\r\nWe also consulted Shaykh Hasan and his cousin Ahmed, alias Abú\r\nKhartúm, concerning the origin of his tribe, the Beni 'Ukbah.\r\nAccording to our friend Furayj, the name means \"Sons of the Heel\"\r\n('Akab) because, in the early wars and conquests of El-Islám,\r\nthey fought during the day by the Moslems' side; and at night,\r\nwhen going over to the Nazarenes, they lost the \"spoor\" by\r\nwearing their sandals heel foremost, and by shoeing their horses\r\nthe wrong way. All this they indignantly deny; and they are borne\r\nout by the written genealogies, who derive them from \"Ukbah, the\r\nson of Maghrabah, son of Heram,\" of the Kahtániyyah (Joctanite)\r\nArabs, some of the noblest of Bedawi blood. They preserve the\r\nmemory of their ancestor 'Ukbah, and declare that they come from\r\nthe south; that is, they are of Hejázi descent, consequently far\r\nmore ancient than the Huwaytát. At first called \"El-Musálimah,\"\r\nthey were lords of all the broad lands extending southward\r\nbetween Shámah (Syria) and the Wady Dámah below the port of Zibá;\r\nand this fine valley retains, under its Huwayti occupants, the\r\ntitle of 'Ukbíyyah--'Ukbah-land. Thus they still claim as Milk,\r\nor \"unalienable property,\" the Wadys Gharr, Sharmá, 'Aynúnah, and\r\nothers; whilst their right to the ground upon which Fort\r\nel-Muwaylah is built has never been questioned.\r\n\r\nThe first notable event in the history of the Beni 'Ukbah was a\r\nquarrel that arose between them and their brother-tribe, the Beni\r\n'Amr. The 'Ayn el-Tabbákhah,[EN#93] the fine water of Wady\r\nMadyan, now called Wady Makná, was discovered by a Hutaymi\r\nshepherd of the Beni 'Ali clan, while tending his flocks; others\r\nsay that the lucky man was a hunter following a gazelle. However\r\nthat may be, the find was reported to the Shaykh of the Musálimah\r\n(Beni 'Ukbah), who had married 'Ayayfah, the sister of Ali ibn\r\nNejdi, the Beni 'Amr chief, whilst the latter had also taken his\r\nbrother-in-law's sister to wife. The discoverer was promised a\r\nJinu or Sabátah (\"date-bunch\") from each palm-tree; and the\r\nrivals waxed hot upon the subject. The Musálimah declared that\r\nthey would never yield their rights, a certain ancestor,\r\n'Asaylah, having first pitched tent upon the Rughámat Makná, or\r\nwhite \"horse\" of Makná. A furious quarrel ensued, and, as usual\r\nin Arabia as in Hibernia, both claimants prepared to fight it\r\nout.\r\n\r\nTo repeat the words of our oral genealogist, Furayj: \"Now, when\r\nthe wife of the Shaykh of the Musálimah had heard and understood\r\nwhat Satan was tempting her husband to do against her tribe, she\r\nrose up, and sent a secret message to her brother of the Beni\r\n'Amr, warning him that a certain person (Fulán) was about to lay\r\nviolent hands on the beautiful valley of El-Madyan. Hearing this,\r\nthe Beni 'Amr mustered their young men, and mounted their horses\r\nand dromedaries, and rode forth with jingling arms; and at\r\nmidnight they found their opponents asleep in El-Khabt,[EN#94]\r\nthe beasts being tied up by the side of their lords. So they cut\r\nthe cords of the camels, they gagged the hunter who guided the\r\nattack, they threatened him with death if he refused to obey, and\r\nthey carried him away with them towards Makná.\r\n\r\n\"When the Musálimah awoke, they discovered the deceit, they\r\nsecured their beasts, and they hastened after the enemy,\r\nfollowing his track like Azrail. Both met at Makná, when a battle\r\ntook place, and Allah inclined the balance towards the Beni 'Amr.\r\nThe Musálimah, therefore, became exiles, and took refuge in\r\nEgypt. And in the flow of days it so happened that the Shaykh of\r\nthe Beni' Amr awoke suddenly at midnight, and heard his wife, as\r\nshe sat grinding at the quern, sing this quatrain:--\r\n\r\n     'If the handmill (of Fate) grind down our tribe\r\n     We will bear it, O Thou (Allah) that aidest to bear!\r\n     But if the mill grind the foeman tribe,\r\n     We will pound and pound them as thin as flour.'\r\n\r\n\"Whereupon the Shaykh, in his wrath, seized a stone, and cast it\r\nat his wife, and knocked out one of her front teeth. She said\r\nnothing, but she took the tooth and wrapped it in a rag, and sent\r\nit with a message to her brother, the Shaykh of the Musálimah.\r\nNow, this chief was unable to revenge his sister single-handed,\r\nso he travelled to Syria, and threw himself at the feet of the\r\ngreat Shaykh of the Wuhaydi tribe, who was also a Sherif.\r\n\r\n\"The Wuhaydi despatched his host together with the warriors of\r\nthe Musálimah, and both went forth to do battle with the Beni\r\n'Amr. The latter being camped in a valley near 'Aynúnah, tethered\r\ntheir dogs and, some say, left behind their old people,[EN#95]\r\nand lit huge bonfires; whence the name of the place is Wady Umm\r\nNírán ('the Mother of Fires') to this day. Before early dawn they\r\nhad reached in flight the Wady 'Arawwah of the Jibál el-Tihámah.\r\nIn the morning the Musálimah and the Wuhaydi, finding that a\r\ntrick had been practiced upon them, followed the foe, and beat\r\nhim in the Wady 'Arawwah, killing the Shaykh. And the chief of\r\nthe Musálimah gave his widowed sister as wife to the Wuhaydi, and\r\nsettled with his people in their old homes. The Beni 'Amr fled to\r\nthe Hismá, and exiled themselves to Kerak in Syria, where they\r\nstill dwell, owning the plain called Ganán Shabíb. There is now\r\npeace between the Beni 'Ukbah and their kinsmen the Beni 'Amr.\"\r\n\r\nThe second event in the history of the tribe, the \"Tale of Abú\r\nRísh,\"[EN#96] shall also be told in the words of Furayj:--\"After\r\nthe course of time the Beni 'Ukbah, aided by the Ma'ázah, made\r\nwar against the Shurafá, who were great lords in those days, and\r\nplundered them and drove them from their lands. The victors were\r\nheaded by one Salámah, a Huwayti who dwelt at El-'Akabah, and who\r\nhad become their guest. In those ages the daughters of the tribe\r\nwere wont to ride before the host in their Hawádig\r\n('camel-litters'), singing the war-song to make the warriors\r\nbrave. As Salámah was the chief Mubáriz ('champion in single\r\ncombat'), the girls begged him to wear, when fighting, a white\r\nostrich feather in his chain-helmet, that they might note his\r\ndeeds and chant in his name. Hence his title, Abú Rísh--the\r\n'Father of a Feather.' The Sherifs, being beaten, made peace,\r\ntaking the lands between Wady Dámah and El-Hejaz; whilst the Beni\r\n'Ukbah occupied Midian Proper (North Midian), between 'Dámah' and\r\n'Shámah' (Syria).\r\n\r\n\"Abú Rísh, who was a friend to both victor and vanquished,\r\nsettled among the Sherifs in the Sirr country south of Wady\r\nDámah. He had received to wife, as a reward for his bravery, the\r\ndaughter of the Shaykh of the Beni 'Ukbah; and she bare him a\r\nson, 'Id, whose tomb is in the Wady Ghál, between Zibá and\r\nEl-Muwaylah. On the Yaum el-Subúh ('seventh day after birth'),\r\nthe mother of 'Id followed the custom of the Arabs; and, after\r\nthe usual banquet, presented the babe to the guests, including\r\nher father, who made over Wady 'Aynúnah in free gift to his\r\ngrandson. Now, 'Id used to lead caravans to Cairo, for the\r\npurpose of buying provisions; and he was often plundered by the\r\nMa'ázah, who had occupied by force the Wadys Sharmá, Tiryam, and\r\nSurr of El-Muwaylah.\r\n\r\n\"This 'Id ibn Salámah left, by a Huwayti woman, a son 'Alayán,\r\nsurnamed Abú Takíkah ('Father of a Scar') from a sabre-cut in the\r\nforehead: he was the founder of the Tugaygát-Huwaytát clan, and\r\nhis descendants still swear by his name. Once upon a time, when\r\nleading his caravan, he reached the Wady 'Afál, and he learned\r\nthat his enemies, the Ma'ázah, and the black slaves who\r\ngarrisoned El-Muwaylah, were lurking in the Wady Marayr. So he\r\nplaced his loads under a strong guard; and he hastened, with his\r\nkinsmen of the Huwaytát, to the Hismá, where the Ma'ázah had left\r\ntheir camels undefended: these he drove off, and rejoined his\r\ncaravan rejoicing. The Ma'ázah, hearing of their disaster,\r\nhurried inland to find out the extent of the loss, abandoning the\r\nblack slaves, who, nevertheless, were still determined to plunder\r\nthe Káfilah. 'Alayán was apprized of their project; and, reaching\r\nthe Wady Umm Gehaylah, he left his caravan under a guard, and\r\nsecretly posted fifty matchlock-men in El-Suwayrah, east of the\r\nhills of El-Muwaylah. He then (behold his cunning!) tethered\r\nbetween the two hosts, at a place called Zila'h, east of the tomb\r\nof Shaykh Abdullah,[EN#97] ten camel-colts without their dams.\r\nRoused by the bleating, the negro slaves followed the sound and\r\nfell into the ambush, and were all slain.\r\n\r\n\"'Alayán returned to the Sirr country, when his tribe, the\r\nHuwaytát, said to him, 'Hayya (up!) to battle with these Ma'ázah\r\nand Beni 'Ukbah; either they uproot us or we uproot them!' So he\r\ngathered the clan, and marched to a place called El-Bayzá,[EN#98]\r\nwhere he found the foe in front. On the next day the battle\r\nbegan, and it was fought out from Friday to Friday; a truce was\r\nthen made, and it was covenanted to last between evening and\r\nmorning. But at midnight the enemy arose, left his tents pitched,\r\nand fled to the Hismá. 'Alayán followed the fugitives, came up\r\nwith them in the Wady Sadr, and broke them to pieces. Upon this\r\nthey took refuge in Egypt and Syria.\r\n\r\n\"After a time the Beni 'Ukbah returned, and obtained pardon from\r\n'Alaya'n the Huwayti, who imposed upon them six conditions.\r\nFirstly, having lost all right to the land, they thus became\r\n'brothers' (i.e. serviles). Secondly, they agreed to give up the\r\nprivilege of escorting the Hajj-caravan. Thirdly, if a Huwayti\r\nwere proved to have plundered a pilgrim, his tribe should make\r\ngood the loss; but if the thief escaped detection, the Beni\r\n'Ukbah should pay the value of the stolen property in coin or in\r\nkind. Fourthly, they were bound not to receive as guests any\r\ntribe (enumerating a score or so) at enmity with the Huwaytát.\r\nFifthly, if a Shaykh of Huwaytát fancied a dromedary belonging to\r\none of the Beni 'Ukbah, the latter must sell it under cost price.\r\nAnd, sixthly, the Beni 'Ukbah were not allowed to wear the 'Abá\r\nor Arab cloak.\"[EN#99]\r\n\r\nThe Beni 'Ukbah were again attacked and worsted, in the days of\r\nSultan Selim, by their hereditary foe, the Ma'ázah. They\r\ncomplained at Cairo; and the Mamlúk Beys sent down an army which\r\nbeat the enemy in the Wady Surr. They had many quarrels with\r\ntheir southern neighbours, the Baliyy: at last peace was made,\r\nand the land was divided, the Beni 'Ukbah taking the tract\r\nbetween Wadys Da'mah and El-Muzayrib. Since that time the tribe\r\nhas been much encroached upon by the Huwayta't. It still claims,\r\nhowever, as has been said, all the lands between El-Muwaylah and\r\nMakná, where they have settlements, and the Jebel Harb, where\r\nthey feed their camels. They number some twenty-five to thirty\r\ntents, boasting that they have hundreds; and, as will appear,\r\ntheir Shaykh, Hasan el-'Ukbi, amuses himself by occasionally\r\nattacking and plundering the wretched Maknáwis, or people of\r\nMakná, a tribe weaker than his own.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Chapter VI.\r\n     To Makná, and Our Work There--the Magáni or Maknáwis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter a silly fortnight at old Madiáma, I resolved to march upon\r\nits seaport, Makná, the <Greek>      of Ptolemy, which the people\r\ncall also \"Madyan.\"[EN#100] We set out at seven a.m. (January\r\n25th); and, after a walk of forty-five minutes, we were shown by\r\nFurayj a Ghadír, or shallow basin of clay, shining and bald as an\r\nold scalp from the chronic sinking of water. In the middle stood\r\ntwo low heaps of fine white cement, mixed with brick and gravel;\r\nwhile to the west we could trace the framework of a mortared\r\nFiskíyyah (\"cistern\"), measuring five metres each way. The ruin\r\nlies a little south of west (241 deg. mag.) from the greater\r\n\"Shigd;\" and it is directly under the catacombed hill which bears\r\nthe \"Praying-place of Jethro.\" A tank in these regions always\r\npresupposes a water-pit, and there are lingering traditions that\r\nthis is the \"Well of Moses,\" so generally noticed by mediæval\r\nArab geographers. It is the only one in the Wady Makná, not to\r\nmention a modern pit about an hour and a half further down the\r\nvalley, sunk by the Bedawin some twenty feet deep: the walls of\r\nthe latter are apparently falling in, and it is now bone-dry. But\r\nthe veritable \"Moses' Well\" seems to have been upon the coast;\r\nand, if such be the case, it is clean forgotten. True, Masá'íd,\r\nthe mad old Ma'ázi, attempted to trace a well inside our camp by\r\nthe seashore; but the Beni 'Ukbah, to whom the land belongs, had\r\nnever heard of it.\r\n\r\nAfter marching about six miles, we entered a gorge called Umm\r\nel-Bíbán, \"the Mother of Gates,\" formed by the stony spurs of the\r\nWady bank: the number of birds and trees, especially in the\r\nsyenitic valleys, showed that water could not be far off. At\r\n10.10 a.m. a halt was called at the half-way place, a bay or\r\nhollow in the left cliff, El-Humayrah--\"the Little Red\"--an\r\noverhanging wall of ruddy grit some eighty feet high, with strata\r\nvarying in depth from a few lines to as many fathoms, all\r\ndiffering in colour, and all honeycombed, fretted, and sculptured\r\nby wind and rain. Above the red grit, weathered into a thousand\r\nqueer shapes, stood strata of chloritic sand, a pale\r\nyellow-green, and capping it rose the usual dull-brown carbonate\r\nof lime. Large fossil oysters lay in numbers about the base,\r\nsuggesting a prehistoric feast of the Titans. Amongst them is the\r\nmonstrous Tridacna (gigantea), which sometimes attains a growth\r\nof a yard and a half; one of these is used as a bénitier at the\r\nchurch of Saint Sulpice, Paris. Amongst the layers were wavy\r\nbands of water-rolled crystals, jaspers, bloodstones,\r\niron-revetted pebbles, and \"almonds,\" which, in the Brazil,\r\naccompany and betray the diamond.[EN#101] We had no time to make\r\na serious search; but, when the metals shall be worked, it will,\r\nperhaps, be advisable to import a skilled prospecter from the\r\nBrazil or the Cape of Good Hope.\r\n\r\nAt noon we met the \"heaven-sent, life-sustaining sea-breeze;\" and\r\nnow the broad and well-marked Wady Makná, with its rosy-pink\r\nsands, narrowed to a gut, flanked and choked on both sides, north\r\nand south, by rocks of the strangest tricolour, green-black,\r\nyellow-white, and rusty-red. The gloomy peak, which had long\r\nappeared capping the heights ahead, proved to be the culmination\r\nof a huge upthrust of porphyritic trap. Bottle-green when seen\r\nunder certain angles, and dull dead sable at others, it was\r\nvariegated by cliffs and slopes polished like dark mirrors, and\r\nby sooty sand-shunts disposed at the natural slope. Crumbling\r\noutside, the lower strata pass from the cellular to the compact,\r\nand are often metalliferous when in contact with the quartz: at\r\nthese Salbandes the richest mineral deposits are always found.\r\nSet in and on the black flanks, and looking from afar like the\r\ngouts of a bloodstone, are horizontal beds, perpendicular spines,\r\nand detached blocks of felsitic porphyry and of rusty-red\r\nsyenite, altered, broken, and burnt by plutonic heat. In places,\r\nwhere the trap has cut through the more modern formations, it has\r\nbeen degraded by time from a dyke to a ditch, the latter walled\r\nby the ruddy rocks, and sharply cut as a castle-moat. And already\r\nwe could see, on the right of the Wady, those cones and crests of\r\nghastly, glaring white gypsum, which we had called \"the Hats.\"\r\n\r\nThese gloomy cliffs, approaching the maritime plain, sweep away\r\nto the south, and melt into the \"Red Hills\" visited on our first\r\nexcursion. They are known as the Jebel el-'Abdayn--\"of the Two\r\nSlaves:\" this, perhaps, is the Doric pronunciation of the Bedawin\r\nfor Abdín--\"slaves.\" Presently we sighted the familiar features\r\nof the seaboard, described in my first volume, especially the\r\nRughámat el-Margas to the north; and westward the Gulf of\r\n'Akabah, looking cool and blue in the Arabian glare. After five\r\nhours and thirty minutes (= seventeen miles and a half) in the\r\nsaddle we reached Makná.\r\n\r\nI had thought of encamping near the \"Praying-place of Moses,\" a\r\nfine breezy site which storms would have made untenable. As at\r\nSharmá, camels must turn off to the right over the banks when\r\napproaching the mouth of the Wady Madyan, whose bed is made\r\nimpassable by rocks and palm-thicket. We then proposed to pitch\r\nthe tents upon the valley sands within the \"Gate,\" but this was\r\noverruled by the Sayyid, who told grisly tales of fever and ague.\r\nFinally, we returned to our former ground, near the old\r\nconglomerates and the mass of new shells, which ledge the shore\r\nof the little harbour. Approaching it, we were delighted to see\r\nthe gunboat Mukhbir steaming up, despite the contrary wind, from\r\nSharm Yáhárr; she was towing the Sambúk, which brought from\r\n'Aynúnah Bay our heavy gear, rations, and tools. This was a\r\nstroke of good luck: already we were on half rations, and provant\r\nfor men and mules threatened to run short.\r\n\r\nOur week at Makná (January 25--February 2) justified the pleasant\r\nimpression left by the first visit, and enabled us to correct the\r\ninaccuracies of a flying survey.\r\n\r\nThis \"Valley of Waters,\" with its pink and yellow (chloritic)\r\nsands, is bounded on the right near the sea by a sandbank about\r\none hundred feet high, a loose sheet thinly covering the dykes of\r\nsyenite and the porphyritic trap which in places peep out.\r\nPossibly it contains, like the left flank, veins of quartz,\r\nlowered by corrosion, and concealed by the sand-drift spread by\r\nthe prevalent western winds. The high-level abounds in detached\r\nsprings, probably the drainage of the Rughámat Makná, the huge\r\n\"horse\" or buttress of gypsum bearing north-east from the\r\nharbour. The principal veins number three. The uppermost and\r\nsweetest is the Ayn el-Tabbákhah; in the middle height is\r\nEl-Túyuri (Umm el-Tuyúr), with the dwarf cataract and its\r\ntinkling song; whilst the brackish 'Ayn el-Fara'í occupies the\r\nvalley sole. Besides these a streak of palms, perpendicular to\r\nthe run of the Wady, shows a rain-basin, dry during the droughts,\r\nand, higher up, the outlying dates springing from the arid sands,\r\nare fed by thin veins which damp the rocky base. Hence, probably,\r\nDr. Beke identified the place with the \"Elim\" of the Exodus: his\r\nartist's sketch from the sea (p. 340) is, however, absolutely\r\nunrecognizable.\r\n\r\nThe high-level spring and the middle water rise in sandy basins;\r\ncourse down deeply furrowed beds of grit; and, after passing\r\nthrough a tangle of vegetation, a dense forest of palms, alive\r\nand dead, and open patches sown with grain, wilfully waste their\r\ntreasures in the upper slope of the right bank. This abundance of\r\nwater has developed a certain amount of industry; although the\r\nBedawin tear to pieces the young male-dates, whose tender green\r\ngrowth, at the base of the fronds, supplies them with a \"chaw.\" A\r\nnumber of artificial runners has been trained to water dwarf\r\nbarley-plots, whose fences of date-fronds defend them from sheep\r\nand goats; and further down the bank are the fruit trees which\r\nfirst attracted our attention.\r\n\r\nThe low-level water consists of two springs. The upper is the\r\n'Ayn el-'Aryánah, springing from the sands under the date-trees\r\nwhich line the right and left sides: apparently it is the\r\ndrainage of a gypsum \"hat,\" called El-Kulayb, \"the Little\r\nDog\"--in their Doric the Bedawin pronounce the word Galáib.\r\nFurther down the bed, and divided by a tract of dry sand, is the\r\n'Ayn el-Fara'i, which also rises from both banks, forms a single\r\nstream, sleeps in deep pellucid pools like fairy baths among the\r\nhuge boulders of grey granite, and finally sinks before reaching\r\nthe shore. When these waters shall again be regulated, as of old,\r\nthey will prove amply sufficient for the vegetable and the\r\nmineral. Anton, the Greek, who everywhere saw the shop, was so\r\ncharmed with the spot, that he at once laid out his\r\nestablishment: here shall be the hotel; there the billiard and\r\ngambling room, and there the garden, the kiosk, the buvette--in\r\nfact, he projected a miner's paradise.\r\n\r\nOn the crest of this right bank, above the vegetation, lies the\r\ntraditional Musallat Musá (\"Moses' Oratory\"), of which the\r\nfoundations, or rather the base-stones, are in situ. The larger\r\nenceinte measures, without including two walls projecting from\r\nthe north-east and north-west angles, an oblong of thirty-seven\r\nby twenty-five feet; and, as usual with Midianite ruins, it has\r\nbeen built of all manner of material. The inner sanctum opens to\r\nthe west, the northern and southern basement-lines only\r\nremaining: the former is composed of eight blocks of gypsum\r\nresembling alabaster, five being larger than the others; and the\r\nsouthern of three. Upon these the Bedawin still deposit their\r\nsimple ex-votos, oyster and other shells, potsherds, and coloured\r\npebbles.[EN#102]\r\n\r\nThe left or opposite bank, which wants water, is formed by the\r\ntall conglomerate-capped cliffs, which support the \"Muttali'\" or\r\nhauteville, and by the warty block called Jebel el-Fahísát. In\r\n\"The Gold-Mines of Midian\" (Chap. XII.) it is called El-Muzayndi,\r\nan error of my informants for El-Muzeúdi: the latter is the name\r\nof the small red hill north of our camp. I again visited the high\r\ntown, which is about a hundred feet above the valley: presently\r\nit will disappear bodily, as its base is being corroded, like the\r\nJebel el-Safrá of Magháir Shu'ayb. The walls still standing form\r\na long room running north-south; and the two adjoining closets\r\nset off to the north-east and south-east. This sadly shrunken\r\nupper settlement covers the remnant of the rocky plateau to the\r\neast: there are also traces of building on the southern slopes.\r\nRuined heaps of the usual material, gypsum, dot and line the\r\nshort broad valley to the north, which rejoices in the neat and\r\nhandy name, Wady Majrá Sayl Jebel el-Marú. Here, however, they\r\nare hardly to be distinguished from the chloritic spines and\r\nnatural sandbanks that stud the bed. The only antiquities found\r\nin the \"Muttali\"' were a stone cut into parallel bands, and the\r\nfragment of a basalt door with its pivot acting as hinge in the\r\nupper part: it reminded me of the Græco-Roman townlets in the\r\nHaurán, where the credulous discovered \"giant Cities\" and similar\r\nineptitudes. Our search for Midianite money was in vain; Mr.\r\nClarke, however, picked up, near the sea, a silver \"Taymúr,\" the\r\nMoghal, with a curiously twisted Kufic inscription. (A.H. 734).\r\n\r\nThe 'Ushash or frond-huts of the Maknáwi and the Beni 'Ukbah were\r\nstill mostly empty. At this season, all along the seaboard of\r\nNorth-Western Arabia, the Bedawin are grazing their animals in\r\nthe uplands, and they will not return coastwards till July and\r\nAugust supply the date-harvest. The village shows the\r\ninconséquence of doors and wooden keys to defend an interior made\r\nof Cadjan, or \"dry date-fronds,\" which, bound in bundles, make a\r\ngood hedge, but at all times a bad wall. One of its peculiar\r\nfeatures is what looks like a truncated and roofless oven; in\r\nthis swish cylinder they pound without soaking the date-kernels\r\nthat feed their camels, sheep, and goats. A few youths, however,\r\nwho remained in this apology for a \"deserted village,\" assisted\r\nus in night-fishing with the lantern; and they brought from the\r\nadjoining reefs the most delicate of shell and scale fish. The\r\nbest were the langoustes (Palinurus vulgaris), the clawless\r\nlobsters called crawfish (crayfish) in the United States, and the\r\nagosta or avagosta of the Adriatic: it was confounded by the\r\nEgyptian officers with \"Abú Galambo,\"[EN#103] the crab (Cancer\r\npelagicus). The echinidae of various species, large-spined and\r\nsmall-spined, the latter white as well as dull-red, were\r\npreserved in spirits.[EN#104] Amongst the excellent fish, the\r\nMarján (a Scina) the Sultan el-Bahr, the Palamita (Scomber), the\r\nMakli (red mullets, Mugil cephalus), and the Búri, were monstrous\r\nanimals, with big eyes and long beaks like woodcocks; some of\r\nthese were garnished with rows of ridiculously big teeth. I\r\nfailed to procure live specimens of small turtle, and yet the\r\nhuts were full of carapaces, all broken and eight-ribbed. One\r\nspecies, the Sakar, supplies tortoise-shell sold at Suez for 150\r\npiastres per Ratl or pound; the Bísa'h, another large kind\r\nwithout carapace, is used only for eating: both are caught off\r\nthe reefs and islets. An eel-like water-snake (Marrína = Murna\r\nOphis) showed fight when attacked. The Arabs do not eat it, yet\r\nthey will not refuse the Shaggah, or large black land-snake.\r\n\r\nThe enforced delay at Makná gave us the opportunity of making\r\ncareful reconnaissances in its neighbourhood. During the last\r\nspring I had heard of a Jebel el-Kibí't (\"sulphur-hill\") on the\r\nroad to 'Aynúnah, but no guide was then procurable. Shortly after\r\nour return, a Bedawi named Jázi brought in fine specimens of\r\nbrimstone, pure crystals adhering to the Secondary calcaire, and\r\npossibly formed by decomposition of the sulphate of lime. If this\r\nbe the case we may hope to find the mineral generally diffused\r\nthroughout these immense formations; of course, in some places\r\nthe yield will be richer and in others poorer. Further\r\ninvestigation introduced us, as will be seen, to two southern\r\ndeposits, without including one heard of in Northern Sinai. All\r\nlie within a short distance of the sea, and all are virgin: the\r\nBedawin import their sulphur from the \"Barr el-'Ajam,\" the\r\npopular name for Egypt, properly meaning Persia or any non-Arab\r\nland. Thus, in one important article Midian rivals, if not\r\nexcels, the riches of the opposite African shore, where for a\r\nsingle mine thirty millions of francs have been demanded by way\r\nof indemnity.\r\n\r\nBetimes on January 26th, a caravan of four camels, for the two\r\nquarrymen and the guide, set off southwards, carrying sacks,\r\ntools, and other necessaries. They did not return till the\r\nmorning of the third day; Jázi had lost the road, and the Bedawin\r\nrather repented of having been so ready to disclose their\r\ntreasures. Of course, our men could not ascertain the extent of\r\nthe deposits; but they brought back rich specimens which\r\ndetermined me to have the place surveyed. Unfortunately I had\r\nforgotten a sulphur-still; and the engineer vainly attempted to\r\nextract the ore by luting together two iron mortars, and by\r\nheating them to a red heat. The only result was the diffusion of\r\nthe sulphur crystals in the surrounding gypsum. This discovery\r\ngave me abundant trouble; the second search-party was a failure;\r\nand it was not till February 18th that I could obtain a\r\nsatisfactory plan of the northern Jebel el-Kibrít.\r\n\r\nAt Makná I was much puzzled by the presence of the porous basalt,\r\nwhich had yielded to the first Expedition a veinlet of\r\n\"electron\"--gold and silver mixed by the hand of Nature. The\r\nplutonic rock, absent from the Wady Makná, appears in scatters\r\nalong the shore to the north. Our friend Furayj knew nothing\r\nnearer than El-Harrah, the volcanic tract bounding the Hismá on\r\nthe east, and distant some five days' march. This was going too\r\nfar; querns of the same material, found in all the ruins,\r\nsuggested a neighbouring outcrop. Moreover, during the last\r\nspring, I had heard of a mining site called Nakhil Tayyib Ism,\r\nthe \"Palm-orchard (of the Mountain) of the Good Name,\" in the\r\nso-called range to the north of Makná.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Amir was despatched (January 27th) to seek for basalt,\r\nwith a small dromedary-caravan, under the lead of Shaykh Furayj.\r\nAfter winding for about two hours along the shore, which is cut\r\nby the broad mouths of many a Wady; and whose corallines, grits,\r\nand limestones are weathered into the strangest shapes; he left\r\nto the right (east) the light-coloured Jebel Sukk. On the\r\nsouthern side of the Wady (Sukk) which drains it to the sea, a\r\nhill of the porous stone which the Arabs call \"Hajar el-Harrah\"\r\nappeared. The specimens brought home, si vera sunt exposita, if\r\nthey be really taken from an outcrop, prove that volcanic\r\ncentres, detached, sporadic, and unexpected, like those found\r\nfurther north, occur even along the shore. As will afterwards\r\nappear, another little \"Harrah\" was remarked by Burckhardt\r\n(\"Syria,\" p. 522), about one hour and a quarter north of Sinaitic\r\nSherm. He says, \"Here for the first and only time, I saw volcanic\r\nrocks,\" and he considers that their extension towards Ras Abú(?)\r\nMohammed may have given rise to the name <Greek>.\r\n\r\nWellsted,[EN#105] who apparently had not read Burckhardt, makes\r\nthe same remark. The many eruptive centres in the limestones of\r\nSyria and Palestine were discovered chiefly by my late friend,\r\nthe loved and lamented Charles F. Tyrwhitt-Drake. It would be\r\ninteresting to ascertain the relation which they bear to tile\r\ngreat lines of vulcanism in the far interior, the Haura'n and the\r\nHarrah, subtending the coast mountains. And Dr. Beke, another\r\nfriend now no more, would have been delighted to know that his\r\n\"True Mount Sinai\" was not unconnected with a volcanic outbreak.\r\n\r\nBeyond the Wady Sukk, a bad rough path leads along the base of\r\nthe Tayyih Ism Mountain; then the cliffs fall sheer into the sea,\r\nexplaining why caravans never travel that way. Yet there was a\r\nmaritime road, for we know that Abú Sufyán, on his way from Syria\r\nto fight the battle of \"Bedr\" (A.H. 2), passed by a roundabout\r\npath for safety, along the shore of Midian. Thus compelled, the\r\ntrack bends inland, and enters a Nakb, a gash conspicuous from\r\nthe Gulf, an immense cañon or couloir that looks as if ready to\r\nreceive a dyke or vein. Curious to say, a precisely similar\r\nformation, prolonged to the south-west, cuts the cliffs south of\r\nMarsá Dahab in the Sinaitic Peninsula. The southern entrance to\r\nthe gorge bears signs of human habitation: a parallelogram of\r\nstones, 120 paces by 91, has been partially buried by a land-slip\r\n(?); and there are remnants of a dam measuring about a hundred\r\nmetres in length (?). About three hundred yards higher up, water\r\nappears in abundance, and palm clumps grow on both sides of it.\r\nHere, however, all trace of man is wanting; the winter torrents\r\nmust be dangerous; and there is no grass for sheep. The crevasse\r\nnow becomes very wild; the Pass narrows from fifty to ten paces,\r\nand, in one section, a loaded camel can hardly squeeze through;\r\nwhilst the cliff-walls of red and grey granite (?) tower some two\r\nthousand feet above the thread of path.[EN#106] Water which, as\r\nusual, sinks in the sand, is abundant enough in three other\r\nplaces to supply a large caravan; and two date-clumps were\r\npassed. Hence, if all here told be true, the \"Nakhil\r\n(palm-plantation) Tayyib Ism\" reported to the first Expedition.\r\n\r\nAfter covering sixteen miles in five hours, the caravan had not\r\nmade more than half the distance to the Bir el-Máshi, where a\r\nsmall Marsá, or anchorage-ground, called El-Suwayhil (\"the Little\r\nShore\") nestles in the long sand-slope between the mountain\r\nTayyib Ism and its huge northern neighbour, the Mazhafah block.\r\nFrom this \"Well of the Walker,\" a pass leads to the Wady Marsha',\r\nwhere, according to certain Bedawin, are found extensive ruins\r\nand Bíbán (\"doors\"), or catacombs. The whole is, however, an\r\ninvention; our Sayyid had ridden down the valley during his\r\njourney to El-Hakl.\r\n\r\nOn the next day another reconnaissance was made. I had been shown\r\nfine specimens of quartz from the Eastern highlands; moreover, a\r\nbottle of \"bitter\" or sulphur-water from the Wady Mab'úg, the\r\n\"oblique\" or \"crooked\" valley, mentioned in \"The Gold-Mines of\r\nMidian,\"[EN#107] had been brought to us with much ceremony. Those\r\nwho tasted it, indeed, were divided as to whether it smacked more\r\nof brimstone or of ammonia. Accordingly, Mr. Clarke and\r\nLieutenant Yusuf walked up the Wady Makná, and ascended the\r\nMab'úg, where the mineral spring proved to be a shallow pool of\r\nrain-water, much frequented by animals, camels included. Search\r\nfor the \"Marú\" was more successful: they found a network of veins\r\nin the sandstone grits (?) of the Jebel Umm Lasaf; and they thus\r\nestablished the fact that the \"white stone\" abounds to the east\r\nas well as to the south of Makná.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile we were working hard at the Jebel el-Fahísát, the great\r\ndiscovery of the northern journey. I had been struck by the name\r\nof the watercourse to the north of the hauteville, Wady Majrá\r\nSayl Jebel el-Marú--\"the Nullah of the Divide of the Torrent\r\n(that pours) from the Mountain of Quartz.\" Moreover, a Makna'wi\r\nlad, 'Id bin Mohsin, had brought in fine specimens of the Negro\r\nor iridescent variety, offering to show the place. Lastly, other\r\nBedawi had contributed fine specimens of Marú, with the grey\r\ncopper standing out of it in veins. On the evening of January\r\n27th we walked up the picturesque mouth of the Makná valley.\r\nAfter passing the conglomerate \"Gate,\" and the dwarf plantations\r\non both sides above it, we reached in forty-five minutes the spot\r\nwhere the lower water, 'Ayn el-Fara'í, tumbles over rocks of grit\r\nand granite. On the left bank, denoted by a luxuriant growth of\r\nrushes, is an influent called Sha'b el-Kázi, or \"the Judge's\r\nPass.\"[EN#108] Ascending it for a few paces, we struck up the\r\nbroad and open Fiumara, which I shall call for shortness \"Wady\r\nMajrá.\" The main trunk of many branches, it is a smooth incline,\r\nperfectly practicable to camels; with banks and buttresses of\r\ngreen-yellow chloritic sands, and longitudinal spines outcropping\r\nfrom the under surface. It carries off the surplus water from the\r\nnorth-western slopes of that strange wavelike formation, the\r\nJebel el-Fahísát, which bounds the right (southern) bank of the\r\nWady Makná. Presently we sighted the Jebel el-Maru', the\r\nstrangest spectacle. The apex of the gloomy porphyritic trap is a\r\nlong spine of the tenderest azure-white, filmy as the finials of\r\nMilan Cathedral, and apparently melting into thin air. Its crest\r\nseems abnormally tall and distant; and below it a huge grey vein,\r\nhorizontal and wavy, cuts and pierces the peaklet of red rock;\r\nand is cut and pierced, in its turn, by two perpendicular dykes\r\nof porphyritic trap, one flanking the right and the left\r\nshoulders of the low cone. When standing upon the hauteville\r\nduring my first visit, I had remarked this \"white Lady\" of a\r\nvein, without, however, attaching to it any importance.\r\n\r\nAfter a quarter of an hour's walk up the Wady Majrá, we came to\r\nthe sandy base of the rocky Fahísát; and climbed up a\r\ntorrent-ladder with drops and stiff gradients, which were\r\npresently levelled for the convenience of our quarrymen. A few\r\nminutes' \"swarming\" placed us upon the narrow knife-like ridge of\r\nsnowy quartz, so weathered that it breaks under the hand: this is\r\nthe aerial head which from below appears so far. The summit,\r\ndistant from our camp about one direct mile and a quarter, gives\r\n355 degrees to the Gypsum-hill, Ras el-Tárah, on the shore; 358\r\ndegrees to the palm-clump nearest the sea, and due north (360\r\ndegrees, all magnetic) to the tents, which are well in sight. The\r\naltitude is about six hundred feet (aner. 29.40).\r\n\r\nThe view from this summit of the Fahísát is charming as it is\r\nextensive. Westward and broad stretching to the north-west lies\r\nthe fair blue gulf that shows, on its far side, the broken\r\nmountains of the Sinaitic Peninsula. Northwards, at our feet,\r\nstretch the palm-groves of Makná, a torrent of verdure pouring\r\ntowards the shore. A little to the left, sheltered from the\r\nboreal wind by the white gypseous ridge, Ras el-Târah (\"the Head\r\nthat surrounds\"), and flanked at both ends by its triangular\r\nreefs, the Sharm Makná, the past and future port of the mines,\r\nsupports the miniature gunboat no larger than a \"cock,\" and the\r\nSambúk dwarfed to a buoy. Beyond the purpling harbour, along the\r\nglaring yellow shore, cut by broad Wady-mouths and dotted here\r\nand there with a date-clump, the corallines, grits, and\r\nsandstones are weathered to the quaintest forms, giant pins and\r\nmushrooms, columns and ruined castles. These maritime lowlands\r\nare bounded on the north by heights in three distinct planes: the\r\nnearest is the Jebel Sukk, low and white; farther rises Tayyib\r\nIsm, a chocolate-coloured mass studded with small peaks; while\r\nthe horizon is closed by the grand blue wall, the Jebel\r\nel-Mazhafah. In places their precipices drop bluff to the sea;\r\nbut the huge valley-mouths separating the two greater ridges,\r\nhave vomited a quantity of sand, forming the tapering tongue and\r\ntip known as the \"Little Shore.\" Turning to the east and the\r\nsouth-east we have for horizon the Wady el-Kharaj (El-Akhraj?),\r\nbacked by its immense right bank of yellow gypsum, which dwarfs\r\neven the Rughámat Makná, and over it we catch sight of the dark\r\nand gloomy Kalb el-Nakhlah, a ridge which, running parallel with\r\nand inland of the Fahísát, will be worked when the latter is\r\nexhausted.\r\n\r\nWe at once recognized the value of this discovery when, reaching\r\nthe tents, we examined the quartz, and found it seamed and pitted\r\nwith veins and geodes containing Colorado, earthy and crumbling\r\nmetallic dust, chlorure, iodure, and bromure of silver, with\r\nvarious colours, red, ochre-yellow, and dark chocolate-brown. It\r\nstained the fingers, and was suspiciously light--n'importe. I\r\nmust regret that here, as indeed throughout the exploration, all\r\nour specimens were taken from the surface: we had not time to dig\r\neven a couple of feet deep. The lad 'Id almost fainted with joy\r\nand surprise when the silver dollars were dropped into his hand,\r\none by one, with the reiteration of \"Here's another for you! and\r\nhere's another!\" This lavishness served to stimulate cupidity,\r\nand every day the Bedawin brought in specimens from half a dozen\r\ndifferent places. But the satisfaction was at its height when the\r\ncrucible produced, after cupellation, a button of \"silver\"\r\nweighing some twenty grammes from the hundred grammes of what the\r\ngrumbling Californian miners had called, in their wrath, \"dashed\r\nblack dust;\"[EN#109] and when a second experiment yielded\r\ntwenty-eight grammes (each fifteen grains and a half) and ten\r\ncentigrammes from 111 grammes, or about a quarter of a pound\r\navoirdupois. In the latter experiment also, the culot came away\r\nwithout the litharge, which almost always contains traces of\r\nsilver and antimony. Hence we concluded that the proportions were\r\n30:110--a magnificent result, considering that 12-1/2:100 is held\r\nto be rich ore in the silver mines of the Pacific States.[EN#110]\r\nThe engineer was radieux with pride and joy. The yellow tint of\r\nthe \"buttons\" promised gold--two per cent.? Three per cent.?\r\nImmense wealth lay before us: a ton of silver is worth 250,000\r\nfrancs. Meanwhile--and now I take blame to myself--no one thought\r\nof testing the find, even by a blow with the hammer.\r\n\r\nAlas! THE \"SPLENDID BUTTONS\" PROVED TO BE IRON, CONTAINING ONLY TWO AND A\r\nHALF GRAMMES OF SILVER TO ONE HUNDRED KILOGRAMMES.[EN#111]\r\n\r\nI can afford to make merry on the absurd mistake, which at the\r\ntime filled the camp with happiness. The Jebel el-Fahísát played\r\nus an ugly trick; yet it is, not the less, a glorious\r\nmetalliferous block, and I am sure of its future.\r\n\r\nThe rest of our time at Makná was given to the study of this\r\ndiscovery. The great quartz-wall or vein runs nearly due north\r\nand south, with a dip of 5 degrees west; it has pierced the\r\nsyenite, forming a sheet down one peak, spanning a second, and\r\nfinally appearing in an apparently isolated knob, that bore from\r\nthe apex 215 degrees (mag.) The upper part, like that of the\r\nJebel el-Abyaz, is apparently sterile: at a lower horizon it\r\nbecomes panaché; and at last almost all is iridescent--in fact,\r\nit is the Filon Husayn, still richer in veins and geodes. The\r\nfilets and fibrils of dust are exposed to sight in the flanks,\r\nand near the base of the great quartz-vein: we should never have\r\nbeen able to remove the barren upper capping.\r\n\r\nEvery day's work brought with it some novelty. The Jebel el-Mará,\r\nthe centre or focus of the formation, was found to push out veins\r\nto the north, extending within a few yards of the Wady Makná's\r\nmouth. Here, however, the quartz imbedded in grey granite appears\r\ncupriferous, producing fine grey copper (?); and the same is the\r\ncase to the east of the Fahísát block. Other green-tinged veins\r\nwere found bearing 205 degrees (mag.) from our camp. There is\r\nalso a quartz-hill whose valley-drain, about a mile and a third\r\nlong, leads down to the sea, about two minutes' walk south of the\r\nsouthern clump of \"tabernacles\" occupied by the Maknáwis. The\r\ndust is richest, as usual, at the walls where the vein is in\r\nimmediate contact with the heat-altered granites, whose red\r\nvariety, containing very little mica, becomes quasi-syenitic.\r\nCertain of the Expedition thought that the Fahísát showed signs\r\nof having been worked by the ancients: my eyes could see nothing\r\nof the kind. And here, as in other parts of our strange country,\r\nthere is a medley, a confusion of different formations.\r\n\r\nOn February 2nd, the day before we left Makná, the Arabs brought\r\nin heavy masses of purple-black, metalliferous rock, scattered\r\nover the gorges and valleys south of the Jebel el-Fahísát; while\r\nothers declared that they could point out a vein in situ. Our\r\nengineer declared it to be argentiferous galena, but it proved to\r\nbe magnetic iron. His assays were of the rudest: he broke at\r\nleast one crucible per day, lamenting the while that he had been\r\nsupplied with English articles, instead of creusets de Bourgogne.\r\nAnd no wonder! He treated them by a strong blast in a furious\r\ncoal-fire without previous warming. His muffle was a wreck, and\r\nsuch by degrees became the condition of all his apparatus.\r\nHowever, as we sought, so we found: hardly a Bedawi lad in camp\r\nbut unpouched some form of metallic specimens. The Shaykhs\r\ndeclared that the wealth of \"Kárún\" must have been dug here; and\r\nI vainly told them that the place of punishment of Korah, Dathan,\r\nand Abiram is still shown by Christians in the Convent of Mount\r\nSinai.[EN#112]\r\n\r\nOn January 28th, after a ruddy and cloudy sunset, El-Ayli, the\r\n'Akabah wind, beginning at eleven p.m., gave us a taste of his\r\nquality. These northers are the Tyrants of the Gulf; which,\r\ncomparatively unbroken by capes and headlands, allows them all\r\ntheir own way, carrying a strong swell, and at times huge waves,\r\nto meet the tide inflowing from the Red Sea. The storm began with\r\na rush and a roar, as if it came from above. The gravel, striking\r\nthe canvas, sounded like hail or heavy rain-drops; it then kicked\r\ndown at one blow the two large tents: they had been carefully\r\npitched above the reach of water, when wind only was to be\r\nguarded against. Fortunately most of our goods were packed, in\r\nexpectation of embarking on the morrow; but the fall broke all\r\nthe breakables that were not under cover, and carried newspapers\r\nand pamphlets, including--again, alas!--the Reseau Pentagonal of\r\nElie de Beaumont, over the plain southwards till arrested by the\r\nheights of Jebel el-Fahísát. This Bora, as it would be called on\r\nthe Adriatic, makes the air exceptionally cold and raw before\r\ndawn: it appears to abate between noon and sunset, and it is most\r\nviolent at night: it either sensibly increases or lessens in\r\nturbulence with moonrise; and it usually lasts from three to\r\nseven days. We rigged up one of the native huts with the awning\r\nof a tent, till it looked very like a Gypsy dwelling, and in\r\npatience we possessed our souls, grumbling horridly like Britons.\r\n\r\nPoor Captain Mohammed of the Mukhbir, who had already escaped one\r\nshipwreck, was in mortal terror: he at once got up steam, and\r\nkept his weary vigil all night. He was perfectly safe, as the\r\nnorthern reef, under which the Sambúk Musahhil rode easily as if\r\nin smooth water, and the headland, Ras el-Tárah, formed a\r\ncomplete defence against the Aylí, while the natural pier to the\r\nsouth would have protected him from its complement, the Azyab or\r\n\"south-easter.\" But it would have been very different had the\r\nstorm veered to the west, and the terrible Gharbi set in. The\r\nport of Makná, which has been described in \"The Gold-Mines of\r\nMidian,\"[EN#113] can hardly be called safe; on the other hand,\r\nits floor has not been surveyed, and a single brise-lame seawards\r\nwould convert it into a dock. I should propose a gallegiante, a\r\nfloating breakwater, tree-trunks in bundles strongly bound\r\ntogether with iron cramps and bands, connected by stout rings and\r\nstaples and made fast by anchors to the bottom. And, at any rate,\r\non the Sinaitic shore opposite, at the distance of thirteen\r\nknots, there is, as will appear, an admirable harbour of refuge.\r\n\r\nNext day the cloud-veil lifted; and the mountains of Sinai and\r\nMidian, which before had been hidden as if by a November fog in\r\nLondon, again stood out in sharp and steely blue. I proposed to\r\nboard the gunboat. Afloat we should have been much more\r\ncomfortable than ashore in the raw, high, and dusty-laden wind.\r\nThe Egyptian officers, however, quoted the unnautical Fellah's\r\nfavourite saws, El-barro birr li-Ahlihi--\"Earth is a blessing to\r\nthose upon her\"--Zirtat el-Jimál, wa lá tasbíh el-Samak--\"The\r\nroar of the camels and not the prayer[EN#114] of the fish;\" and\r\nthe sailors' saying, Kalb el-Barr, wa lá Sabá el-Bahr--\"Better be\r\na dog ashore than a lion afloat.\" The public voice was decidedly\r\nagainst embarking; so two more days of gale were spent in adding\r\nto our collection of mineralogy. On the other hand, the Sayyid\r\nand the three Shaykhs were anxious for a speedy return to\r\nEl-Muwaylah, where the Hajj-caravan was expected on Safar 10 (=\r\nFebruary 11th), and where their presence would be officially\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\nOn the last day of January I boated off to the Mukhbir several\r\ntons of the specimens collected during the northern march;\r\nincluding the iron, the sulphur, and the fine white gypsum,\r\ncrystalline and amorphous, which forms the Rughámat Makná\r\nLieutenant Yusuf and M. Philipin were directed to remain in camp\r\nuntil they should have collected and placed upon the seashore,\r\nready for embarkation on our return, one ton of white quartz,\r\nthree tons (= one cubic metre) of the iridescent variety, and\r\nfour boxes half full of the \"silver\" (iron) dust whose veins and\r\npockets seam the Negro. They were also to wash in the cradle two\r\ntons of the pounded Cascalho (conglomerate gravel); one ton of\r\nthe green-yellow chloritic or serpentine sand forming the under\r\nsurface of the Wady Makná, reduced to four Girbahs or\r\n\"water-sacks;\" and five tons of the dark metal (not argentiferous\r\ngalena). After that they were to visit the northern Sulphur-hill;\r\nestimate its contents, trace, if possible, its connection with\r\nadjoining formations; map the country and prospect for wood,\r\nwater, and harbour. Lastly, they were ordered to march with the\r\nwhole camp, including our mules, upon El-Muwaylah, and there to\r\nawait my return.\r\n\r\nThe three normal days of El-Aylí had come and gone; still the\r\nFortuna[EN#115] did not fall. The water, paved with dark slate,\r\nand domed with an awning of milky-white clouds, patched here and\r\nthere with rags and shreds of black wintry mist that poured\r\nwestward from the Suez Gulf, showed us how ugly the Birkat\r\n'Akabah can look. As in Iceland also, the higher rose the\r\nbarometer, the higher rose the norther; the latter being a cold\r\ndry wind is, consequently, a heavy wind. And when the sky was\r\ncomparatively clear and blue, the display of cirri was\r\nnoticeable. In some places they formed filmy crosses and thready\r\nlozenges; in others the wrack fell into the shape of the letter\r\nZ; and from the western horizon the curl-clouds shot up thin\r\nrays, with a common centre hid behind the mountains of Sinai,\r\naffecting all the airs of the sun.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving Makná I must give an account of its peculiar\r\ntribe, concerning which \"The Gold-Mines of Midian\"[EN#116]\r\ncontained sundry inaccuracies. These men are not the \"pauper\r\ndescendants of the wealthy Midianites; they cannot boast of\r\nancient race or of noble blood; and their speech differs in\r\nnothing from that of the Arabs around them. There can be no\r\ngreater mistake than to suppose that they represent in any way\r\nthe ancient Nabathæans. In features, complexion, and dress they\r\nresemble the half-settled Bedawin around them; and, like these,\r\nthey show a kind of connection with the Sinaitic tribes. The\r\nMagáni,[EN#117] to whom only the southern clump of huts at Makná\r\nbelongs, call themselves Fawá'idah, Zubáidah, and Ramázání, after\r\nfamilies of the Juhayni stock; and the Fawá'idah have, by\r\ndescent, some title to the name. They are, however, considered to\r\nbe Khaddamín (\"serviles\"), like the Hutaym race, by their\r\nneighbours, who give tile following account of their origin.\r\n\r\nAn Egyptian silk-seller, who accompanied the Hajj-caravan,\r\nhappened to fall asleep at Kubázah, between the stations of\r\n'Aynúnah and Magháir Shu'ayb. His companions went their ways, and\r\nhe, like a \"bean-eater\" as he was, fearing to follow them alone,\r\nmade for Makná. Having married and settled there, and seeing in\r\nthe fertility of the soil a prospective spec., he sent to his\r\nnative country for Fellahín--cultivateurs and peasants--who were\r\ncollected from every part of Pharoah-land and its neighbourhood.\r\nThe new-comers were compelled to pay one-half of their harvest,\r\nby way of El-Akháwah (\"the brother-tax\"), in token of\r\nsubjugation, to the Beni 'Ukbah, the owners of the soil. They\r\nhave gradually acquired Milk (\"legal title\") to the ground.\r\nAccording to some, they first settled at Makná in the days of the\r\nBeni 'Amr, whom they subsequently accompanied to the Hismá, when\r\nflying from the victorious Musálimah. After peace was patched up,\r\nthey were compelled to make over one-fourth of the date-harvest\r\nas El-Akháwah to the 'Imrán-Huwaytát and to the Ma'ázah; whilst\r\nthe Tagaygát-Huwaytát claimed a Bursh, or \"mat of fine reeds,\" as\r\na poll-tax from every head of man. Under these hard conditions\r\nthey are left unmolested; and everything taken from them is\r\nrestored by the Shaykhs who receive tribute. They have no chief,\r\nalthough one Sálim ibn Juwayfili claims the title.\r\n\r\nBefore 1866 the Magáni numbered about a hundred tents: the Wady\r\nMakná was then, they say, a garden; and its cultivators were\r\nremarkable for their goodness and hospitality to strangers. But\r\nin that year a feud with the Beni 'Ukbah was excited, as often\r\nhappens, by the belli teterrima causa; the women quarrelled with\r\none another, saying,\r\n\r\n\"Thy husband is a slave to my husband,\" and so forth. The little\r\ntribe, hoisting two flags of red and white calico with green\r\npalm-fronds for staves, dared the foe to attack it; after a loss\r\nof four killed and sundry wounded, all ran away manfully, leaving\r\ntheir goods at the mercy of the conqueror. Shaykh Hasan el-'Ukbí\r\nwas assisted by the Ma'ázah in looting the Magáni huts, and in\r\ncarrying off the camels, while Shaykh Furayj vainly attempted\r\nconciliation. Shortly afterwards the Maknáwis went in a body to\r\nbeg aid from Hammád el-Sofi, Shaykh of the Turábín tribe, which\r\nextends from Ghazzah (Gaza) westwards to Egypt. Marching with a\r\nhost of armed followers, he took possession of the palm-huts\r\nbelonging to the Beni 'Ukbah, when the owners fled in turn,\r\nleaving behind their women and children. Furayj hastened from\r\n'Aynúnah to settle the quarrel; and at last the Sofi said to him,\r\n\"Whilst I protect the Magáni, do thou protect the Beni 'Ukbah.\"\r\nWhereupon the latter returned from their mountain-refuge to\r\nEl-Muwaylah. The Magáni at the present time are mostly camped\r\nabout 'Aynúnah; and only some fifteen head, old men, women, and\r\nboys, who did not take part in the fight, and who live by\r\nfishing, remain at Makná under the protection of the Beni 'Ukbah.\r\nHence the waters are waste and the fields are mostly unhoed.\r\n\r\nSuch is the normal condition of Arabia and the Arabs. What one\r\ndoes the other undoes; what this creates, that destroys.\r\nProfessor Palmer tells us, \"Another misconception is that all\r\nArabs are habitual thieves and murderers.\"[EN#118] Fear of the\r\nterrible vendetta, the blood feud and the blut-geld, amounting to\r\nabout eight hundred dollars, prevents the Bedawin, here as\r\nelsewhere, slaying any but strangers. The traveller's experience,\r\nhowever, was chiefly of the Towarah or Sinaitic Bedawin, a race\r\nwhich, bad as bad could be in the early quarter of the present\r\ncentury, has been thoroughly tamed and cowed by the \"fear of\r\nAllah and the Consul.\" And the curse pronounced by the Jews\r\nagainst their brother Ishmael, \"his hand shall be against every\r\nman,\" etc., must, as was known even in the days of Gibbon, be\r\ntaken with many a grain of salt.\r\n\r\nYet the Bedawin of Midian have till late years been a turbulent\r\n\"mixed multitude,\" and are ready to become troublesome again. It\r\nis only by building forts and by holding the land militarily,\r\nthat the civilized can hope to tame this vermin. I repeat,\r\nhowever, my conviction that the charming Makná Valley is fated to\r\nsee happy years; and that the Wild Man who, when ruled by an iron\r\nhand, is ever ready to do a fair day's work for a fair wage\r\n(especially victuals), will presently sit under the shadow of his\r\nown secular vines and fig-trees.\r\n\r\nAbout midnight on February 2nd, the tempestuous northerly gale,\r\nwhich had now lasted four days and five nights, ceased almost\r\nsuddenly: the signs of the approaching calm were the falling of\r\nthe mercury, the increased warmth of the atmosphere, and the\r\nshifting of the wind towards the east. All hailed the change with\r\njoy. The travellers looked forward to ending their\r\nperegrinations, while the voyagers, myself included, hoped safely\r\nto steam round the Gulf el-'Akabah, and to trace, as correctly as\r\npossible, the extent, the trend, and the puissance of the\r\nquartz-formations. At Cairo Mr. Consul Rogers told me he had\r\nfound them in large quantities veining the red grits of Petra;\r\nand I thought it possible that the \"white stone\" may extend under\r\nthe waters of 'Akabah into the peninsula of Sinai.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Chapter VII.\r\n                Cruise from Maknáto El-'Akabah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis \"Red Sea in the Land of Edom\" (1 Kings ix. 26) is still, as\r\nWellsted entitles it, \"a vast and solitary Gulf.\" It bears a\r\nquaint resemblance to that eastern fork of the northern Adriatic,\r\nthe Quarnero, whose name expresses its terrible storms; while the\r\nSuez branch shows the longer stretch of the Triestine\r\nbifurcation. Yamm Elath or Eloth, as the Hebrews called\r\nEl-'Akabah, has, by the upheaval of the land, lost more of its\r\nfair proportions than its western sister. It was at one time the\r\nembouchure of the Jordan, extending up the Wady el-'Arabah to the\r\nAsphaltite Lake (Dead Sea), before the former became, so to\r\nspeak, a hill and the latter a hole. This view dates from olden\r\ntimes. \"Si suppone,\" says Cornelius à Lapide,[EN#119] \"che sia un\r\nsollevamento che accadde, mentre un abbassamento formava il Mar\r\nMorto; e che il Giordano si gettasse nel Golfo Elanitico (Yamm\r\nAilath), ciò é nel Mar Rosso, prima della destruzione di Sodoma.\"\r\nFor the latter date we have only to read, \"When a movement of\r\ndepression sank the lower Jordan Valley, and its present\r\nreservoirs, the Tiberias Lake and the Dead Sea, to their actual\r\nlevel.\" There is nothing marvellous nor unique in the feature, as\r\nit appears to those suffering from that strange malady, \"Holy\r\nLand on the Brain.\" The Oxus and the Caspian show an identical\r\nformation, only the sinking has been on a smaller scale.\r\n\r\nWellsted was unfortunate, both in his weather and in his craft.\r\nTo encounter a \"sea of breakers\" and \"northerly gales with a high\r\nand dangerous swell\" in a wretched \"bugalá\" (i.e. Sambúk), and in\r\nthat perfect tub, the Palinurus, was somewhat like tempting\r\nProvidence,--if such operation be possible. No wonder that \"in\r\nthis Gulf, in a course of only ninety miles, the nautical mishaps\r\nwere numerous and varied.\" The surveyor, however, neglected a\r\nmatter of the highest interest and importance, namely, to\r\nascertain whether there be any difference of level between the\r\nheads of the Suez and the 'Akabah waters. The vicinity of\r\ncontinuous maritime chains, varying from six to nearly nine\r\nthousand feet, suggests an amount of attraction (theoretically)\r\nsufficient to cause a sensible difference of plane. It would be\r\nwell worth while to run two lines of survey, one from El-'Akabah\r\nto Suez, and the other down the eastern flank of the Sinaitic\r\nPeninsula.\r\n\r\nThe Mukhbir, like the Palinurus, promised a certain amount of\r\nexcitement. Her boiler, I have said, was honeycombed; it was easy\r\nto thrust one's fist through it. Mr. David Duguid, the engineer,\r\nwho on one occasion worked thirty-six hours at a stretch, had\r\napplied for sixty new tubes, and he wanted one hundred and fifty:\r\nwe began with two hundred and forty; we lost, when in the Gulf,\r\nfrom three to nine per diem, a total of seventy five; and the\r\nwork of the engine-room and the ship's carpenters consisted in\r\nplugging fractures with stays, plates, and wedges. Presently the\r\nsteam-gauge (manomètre) gave way, making it impossible to\r\nregister pressure; the combustion chamber showed a rent of\r\neighteen inches long by one wide, the result of too rapid\r\ncooling; and, lastly, the donkey-engine struck work. Under these\r\nhappy circumstances bursting was not to be expected; breaking\r\ndown was, a regular collapse which would have left us like a log\r\nupon the stormy waves. A new boiler might have cost, perhaps,\r\n£900, and the want of one daily endangered a good ship which\r\ncould not be replaced for £9000. I therefore determined upon a\r\n\"Safer Khoriyyah,\" that is, steaming by day and anchoring at\r\nnight in some snug bay. It was also agreed, nem. con., to tow the\r\nSambúk El-Musahhil, in order that, should accidents happen, it\r\nmight in turn act tug to the steamer; or even, at a pinch, serve\r\nus as a lifeboat.\r\n\r\nNothing becomes Makná better than the view on leaving it. A\r\nvaried and attractive picture this, with the turquoise-blue of\r\nthe deep water, the purple and leek-green tints of the shoaly and\r\nsandy little port, and the tawny shore dotted by six distinct\r\npalm-tufts. They are outliers of the main line, yon flood of\r\nverdure, climbing up and streaming down from the high, dry, and\r\nbarren banks of arenaceous drift, heaped up and filmed over by\r\nthe wind, and, lastly, surging through its narrow \"Gate,\" with\r\nthe clifflets of conglomerate forming the old coast. Add the\r\nbluff headland of the Ras el-Tárah to the north of the harbour,\r\nand behind it the Rughámat Makná, the greenish-yellow,\r\nflat-backed \"horse\" of Madyan, which, shimmering in the sunset\r\nwith a pearly lustre, forms the best of landmarks. Finish to the\r\nsouth of the Wady with the quaint chopping outlines of the Jebel\r\nel-Fahísát, resembling from afar a huge alligator lying on the\r\nwater; with the similar but lower forms to the north of the\r\nvalley, both reflected in the Jibál el-Hamrá (the Red Hills),\r\nwhose curtains of green-black trap are broken by sheets of dull\r\ndead-white plaster. Cap the whole with the mighty double quoin of\r\ngypseous Jebel el-Kharaj, buttressing the eastern flank of its\r\nvalley, and with the low, dark metal-revetted hills of the Kalb\r\nel-Nakhlah, a copy of the Fahísát. Throw in the background,\r\nslowly rising as you recede from the shore, a curtain of plutonic\r\npeaks and buttresses, cones, quoins, cupolas, parrot-beaks; with\r\nevery trick of shape, from the lumpy Zahd to the buttressed and\r\npinnacled 'Urnub; with every shade of mountain-tint between\r\nlapis-lazuli and plum-purple. Dome the whole with that marvellous\r\ntransparent sky, the ocean of the air, that spreads loveliness\r\nover the rugged cheek of the Desert; and you have a picture\r\nwhich, though distinctly Arabian, you can hardly expect to see in\r\nArabia.\r\n\r\nFrom the offing, also, we note how the later formations, granite\r\nand syenite, seamed with a network, and often topped by cones, of\r\nporphyritic trap, have upthrust, pierced, and isolated the older\r\nSecondaries. We traced this huge deposit of sulphates and\r\ncarbonates of lime from the southern Wady Hamz, through the\r\nislets at the mouth of the Birkat 'Akabah, all along the shore of\r\nNorth Midian. Here it crosses diagonally the northern third of\r\nthe 'Akabah Gulf, and forms the north-eastern base of the\r\nSinaitic Peninsula; whilst eastward it stretches inland as far as\r\nMagháir Shu'ayb. The general disposition suggests that before the\r\nupheaval of the Gháts, the Jibál el-Tihámah, this vast gypseous\r\nsheet was a plain and plateau covering the whole country, till a\r\nmovement of depression, caused by the upheaval of the igneous\r\nmountains, sank in it the Gulf of 'Akabah. At present the surface\r\nis here flat, there hilly like huge billows breaking mostly to\r\nthe north, and reaching an altitude of twelve hundred feet above\r\nthe surface. Hence the lines stretching north-south, the Fahísát,\r\nthe Red Hills, and the Kalb el-Nakhlah, look like so many\r\nvolcanic island-reefs floating in a sea of greenish-yellow\r\nSecondaries.\r\n\r\nLike the old Irish post-horse, the difficulty and danger of our\r\n\"kettle\" consisted in starting it: two tubes at once burst, and a\r\nnew hole yawned in the boiler; moreover, our anchor had been\r\nthrown out in a depth of seventy-three feet. Enfin! At nine a.m.\r\n(February 3rd) we stood straight for the Sinaitic shore, distant\r\nthirteen miles (direct geographical), and in three hours we made\r\nthe Sharm, Marsá or Minat el-Dahab--the \"Golden Anchorage, Cove,\r\nor Port.\"[EN#120] Another hour was spent in steaming southwards\r\nto the Dock-harbour, wrongly so called in the charts; the pilots,\r\nand the many Sambúks that take refuge in it, know the place only\r\nas Mínát Ginái (Jinái). The northern baylet, preferred when\r\nsoutherly winds blow, is simply the embouchure of the Wady Dahab\r\n(\"Fiumara of Gold\"). The name is properly applied to the\r\nsub-maritime section of the valley draining the eastern flanks of\r\nthe so-called Mount Sinai. This great watercourse breaks through\r\nthe Gháts which, always fringing similar peninsulas, peak to the\r\nsouth. It reaches the Gulf at a shallow sag marked by a line of\r\npalms, the centre of three: they are fed by their several\r\nNullahs, and are watered with the brackish produce of sundry\r\nwells. The statio malefida is defended to the north by a short\r\nsandspit and a submerged reef; and southwards by a projection of\r\nsandstone conglomerate. The latter, running from north-east to\r\nsouth-west, subtends this part of the coast, and serves to build\r\nup the land; after a few years the débris swept down by the\r\nwatercourses will warp up the shallows, dividing shore from\r\noutlier. Such, in fact, seems to be the general origin of these\r\nsandspits; beginning as coralline reefs, they have been covered\r\nwith conglomerates, and converted into terra firma by the rubbish\r\nshot out by the Wady-mouths.\r\n\r\nThe southern port, \"Ginái,\" is formed by a bend in the reef which\r\nsweeps round from east to south-west like a scorpion's tail. The\r\nnatural sea-wall, at once dangerous and safety-giving, protects,\r\nto the south and south-east, diabolitos of black rock visible\r\nonly at high tide: inshore the sickle-shaped breakwater runs by\r\neast to south-west, becoming a \"sandy hook,\" and enclosing a\r\nbasin whose depth ranges from seven to twelve fathoms. Its\r\napproach from the south is clean; and the western opening is\r\nprotected by the tall screen of coast cliffs, the Jebel el-Ginái,\r\nwhose deep-black porphyritic gorge seemingly prolongs that of\r\nMidianite Tayyib Ism. This is a section of the Jibál el-Samghi,\r\nthe coast-range which extends as far north as the Wady Wati'r.\r\nThe Dock-port, so useful when the terrible norther blows, has an\r\nadmirable landmark, visible even from Sináfir Island, and\r\nconspicuous at the entrance of the Gulf. Where the sandy slopes\r\nof South-Eastern Sinai-land end, appears a large white blot,\r\napparently supporting a block, built, like a bastion, upon a tall\r\nhill of porphyritic trap. We called this remnant of material\r\nharder than the rest, Burj el-Dahab--\"the Tower Hill of Dahab.\" I\r\nhave been minute in describing the Golden Harbour: scant justice\r\nhas been done to it by the Hydrographic Chart, and it will prove\r\nvaluable when the Makna' mines are opened. Ahmed Kaptán vainly\r\nattempted soundings--he was too ill to work. Wellsted's\r\nidentification of the site with Ezion-geber (ii. ix.), and the\r\nreef with the rock-ledge which wrecked Jehosaphat's fleet, has\r\none great objection--no ruins are known to exist near it.[EN#121]\r\n\r\nThe formation of this part of Sinai, as far as we can see from\r\nthe shore, reflects, in wilder forms and more abrupt lines, the\r\nopposite coast of Midian: there is, however, the important\r\ndifference that the Secondaries and the quartz-veins, there so\r\nimportant, are here wanting. The skeletons of mountain and hill\r\nappear as if prolonged under water. The ruddy syenite is dyked\r\nand veined by the familiar network of green-black porphyritic\r\ntrap; the filons are disposed in parallels striking north-south,\r\nwith a little easting; the dip is westerly (about 35 degrees\r\nmag.), and the thickness extends to hundreds of feet, often\r\nforming a foundation for the upper cliff. The subaerial parts are\r\nthe same warty and pimply growth which appears on the other side.\r\nNothing could be more wearisome to the Alpine climber than such a\r\ncountry: he would scale the peaks and ridges for fifty feet, to\r\ndescend thirty on the other side; and the frequent Wadys,\r\nankle-deep in loose sand, generally end in steep stony couloirs.\r\nThe watercourses, whose broad mouths are scattered with thin\r\ngreen, contain pebbles and rolled quartzes, including fine\r\nspecimens of the crystallized variety.\r\n\r\nWe landed, after an hour's row in the gig, at the central or main\r\nline of palms; and on the banks of Wady Dahab, here a full mile\r\nwide, we found the works of man, like those of Nature, a copy of\r\nMakná. The date trees and clumps are hedge-closed; two scatters\r\nof 'Ushash (tabernacles) show round towers of rough stone, broken\r\nand patched with palm-frond; and, further north of the Golden\r\nValley, a few old Arab graves have been weathered into mere heaps\r\nof large stones. These are the Kubur el-Nasárá (\"Nazarene's\r\nGraves\") of Burckhardt,[EN#122] a name apparently forgotten by\r\nthe present generation. We vainly sought and asked after ruins:\r\nof old, however, \"Dí'zahab\" might have served to disembark cargo\r\nwhich, by taking the land-route northwards, as the Christian\r\npilgrims still do from El-Nuwaybi', would avoid the dangerous\r\nheadwaters of El-'Akabah. Nor could we believe with\r\nPococke[EN#123] that the place derived its name from the mica\r\nshining like gold; his theory is stultified by the fact that mica\r\nis by no means a prominent feature, even had the Ancients been so\r\nignorant as to be deceived by it.\r\n\r\nThe people were by no means communicative. An elderly man, with a\r\nred turban and sword by side, hurried away from us when we\r\naddressed him, leaving his middle-aged wife to follow with a babe\r\non shoulder and a boy in hand: she also refused to speak, waving\r\nher hand by way of reply to every question. At last a\r\nsemi-civilized being, acquainted with the Convent of St.\r\nCatherine, Selím bin Husayn, of the Muzaynah tribe, satisfied our\r\ncuriosity in view of tobacco, and offered a rudely stuffed\r\nibex-head for a shilling. In the evening our fishermen visited\r\nthe reef, which supplied admirable rock-cod, a bream (?) called\r\nSultan el-Bahr, and Marján (a Sciæna); but they neglected the\r\nfine Sirinjah (\"sponges\"), which here grow two feet long. The\r\nnight was dark and painfully still, showing nought but the\r\nyoungest of moons, and the gloomiest silhouettes of spectral\r\nmountains.\r\n\r\nWe set out at seven a.m. on the next day, when an Azyab or\r\nsouth-easterly wind was promised by the damp air, the slaty sea,\r\nand the gloomy nimbi on the hill-tops. A small party landed after\r\ntwo hours' steaming, in search of quartz, which proved to be\r\nchloritic sandstones and limestones. In the broad valley they\r\nfound a few Muzayni families, with their camels, sheep, and\r\ngoats. These unfortunates had no tents, sleeping under the trees;\r\nthey were desperate beggars, and, although half-starved, they\r\nasked a napoleon for a kid, declaring that such was its price at\r\nthe quarantine station of Tor. Here the errors of the\r\nHydrographic Chart, which have been copied literally by the\r\nlatest and best popular books such as Professor Palmer's \"Desert\r\nof the Exodus,\" began to excite our astonishment. For instance,\r\nRas Kusayr (\"the Short One\") becomes Ras Arser--what a name for a\r\nheadland! A good survey will presently become a sine quâ non.\r\nUnfortunately Ahmed Kaptán was suffering so much that I could not\r\nask him to make solar observations; while the rest of us had\r\nother matters in hand. It was a great disappointment, where so\r\nmuch useful work remains to be done.\r\n\r\nHereabouts the sterile horrors of the hideous Sinaitic shore seem\r\nto reach their climax. The mountains become huge rubbish-heaps,\r\nwithout even colour to clothe their indecently nude forms; and\r\neach strives with its neighbour for the prize of repulsiveness.\r\nThe valleys are mere dust-shunts that shoot out their rubbish,\r\nstones, gravel, and sand, in a solid flow, like discharges of\r\nlava. And, as Jebel Mazhafah, on the opposite coast, is the apex\r\nof the visible eastern Gháts, so beyond this point the Sinaitic\r\nsea-chain of mountains begins to decline into mere hills, while\r\nlonger sand-points project seawards. Such is the near, the real\r\naspect of what, viewed from Makná, appears a scene in fairy-land,\r\ndecked and dight in heavenly hues of blue and purple and rosy\r\nlight--\r\n\r\n     \"Where the bald blear skull of the Desert\r\n          With golden mountains is crowned.\"\r\n\r\nThe first sign of a change of formation appeared near the \"Lower\r\n(southern) Nuwaybi'\" (\"the Little Spring\"), which the chart calls\r\n\"Wasit.\" Here the shore shows blots of dead-white and mauve-red,\r\nin which our engineer at once detected quartz. Seeing it\r\nprolonged in straight horizontal lines, and the red overlying the\r\nwhite, I suspected kaolin and the normal Tauá (coloured clays):\r\nmy conjecture was confirmed on the next day. Hereabouts, Wellsted\r\n(ii. 151) also remarked the colouring of the hills, which\r\nresemble those of \"Sherm;\" some of a deep-blue tinge, and others\r\nstreaked with a brilliant red and violet. We then doubled a long\r\nsandspit running out to sea eastward, and forming, on the north,\r\na deep bay well protected from the souther; whilst several lines\r\nof reef and shallow to the north defend it from the angry Bora.\r\nThis anchorage is known to the pilots as \"Wásit;\" and it occupies\r\nthe southern half of the bay, the northern half and its\r\npalm-groves being called the \"Upper Nuwaybi'.\" About \"Wásit\" the\r\ndate-palms are scattered, and the large sand-drifts ever threaten\r\nto bury them alive. Behind it yawns the great gash, \"Wady Watír,\"\r\nwhich shows its grand lines even from the opposite side of the\r\ngulf: this is the route by which Christian pilgrims from Syria\r\nmake the Sinai monastery, rounding on camels the northern end of\r\nEl-'Akabah. The main valley receives from the north the Wady\r\nel-'Ayn, which can be reached in half a day. From the south,\r\ndistant one whole march, comes the Wady el-Hazrah. This is\r\ndoubtless the Hazeroth of the Exodus, meaning the fenced\r\nenclosures of a pastoral people; and a modern traveller figures\r\nand describes it as \"the most beautiful and romantic landscape in\r\nthe Desert.\" At least, so said the lately shipped guide, Mabru'k\r\nibn Sulayyim el-Muzayni.\r\n\r\nAfter a run of six hours and thirty minutes (= thirty miles), we\r\ncast anchor off Wásit: there was nothing to see ashore, save some\r\nwretched Muzaynah, two males and three females, helpmates meet\r\nfor them, living like savages on fish and shell-molluscs;\r\ndrinking brackish water, and sleeping in the \"bush,\" rather than\r\ntake the trouble to repair the huts. They have no sheep, but a\r\nfew camels; and, by way of boats, they use catamarans composed of\r\ntwo palm-trunks: their home-made hooks resemble the schoolboy's\r\ncrooked pin. Yet these starvelings would not fetch specimens of\r\nthe white stuff, distant, perhaps, two direct miles of cross-cut,\r\nseen near Nuwaybi', and still visible. They also refused, without\r\npreliminary \"bakhshísh,\" to show or even to tell where certain\r\nruins, concerning which they spoke or romanced, are found in\r\ntheir hills. And yet there are theologians who would raise\r\nPoverty, the most demoralizing of all conditions, to the rank of\r\nan \"ecclesiastical virtue.\"\r\n\r\nAt 6 30 a.m. on the next day, the Mukhbir stood eastwards to\r\navoid the northern reef. Presently we passed the \"Upper\r\nNuwaybi',\" a creeklet to the north-west of Wásit, with a\r\nstraggling line of palms fed by the huge Wady Muzayríj. From this\r\npoint to the 'Akabah head all the coast is clean of man. The\r\nJibál el-Samghi now become the Sinaitic Jibál el-Shafah (\"Lip\r\nMountains\"), the latter stretching northwards to the Hajj-road,\r\nand forming the western wall of the 'Arabah valley, whose name\r\nthey assume (Jibál el-'Arabah). The scene abruptly shifts. A\r\nmottle of clouds sheds moving shadows over the hill-crests, and\r\nrelieves them from the appalling monotony of yesterday. Brilliant\r\nrainbow hues, red, green, mauve, purple, yellow and white clays,\r\ngleam in the lowlands, and form dwarf bluffs; while inland,\r\npeering above the granites, the syenites, and the porphyries of\r\nthe coast, pale quoins and naked cones again show the familiar\r\nSecondary formation of Midianitish Makná. We were not surprised\r\nto hear that sulphur had been found in the gypsum of these\r\neastern Gháts of Sinai, when a Jebel el-Kibí't, approached by the\r\nWady Suwayr, was pointed out to us. The natural deduction is that\r\nthe brimstone formation is, like the turquoise, the copper, and\r\nthe manganese, a continuation of the beds that gave a name to\r\nMafka-land; while the metalliferous strata round, in\r\nhorseshoe-form, the head of El-'Akabah, and run down the Arabian\r\nshore, till they become parallel with those subtending the\r\nseaboard of Africa.\r\n\r\nThe view of the eastern or Midianite coast was even more varied\r\nand suggestive. Far inland, and tinged light-blue by distance,\r\nrose the sharp, jagged, and sawlike crests of El-Sharaf, under\r\nwhich the Hajj-caravan wends its weary way, thus escaping the\r\nmountains which dip perpendicularly into the sea. Then come the\r\nbroad and sandy slopes, here and there streaked with dark ridges,\r\nspanned by the Sultáni or Sultan's high-road, and stretching from\r\nthe Gulf to the inner heights. The latter are no longer a double\r\nparallel chain: they bend from south-south-east to\r\nnorth-north-west, and become the Jibál el-Shará', anciently\r\n\"Mount Seir;\" in fact, the eastern retaining-wall of the great\r\nWady 'Arabah. Evidently they are primary, but a white and purple\r\npatch, visible from afar, suggested a Secondary remnant. Several\r\nof the peaks, especially the blue block El-Yitm, appeared to be\r\nof great height; we all remarked its towering stature and trifid\r\nheadpiece, apparently upwards of five thousand feet high, before\r\nwe had heard the tale attached to it. Abreast of us and on the\r\nshore, lie the large inlet and little islet El-Humayzah: the\r\nsurveyors have abominably corrupted it to \"Omeider.\" North of it\r\na palm grove, lining the mouth of a broad Wady which snakes high\r\nup among the sands and stones, denotes the Hajj-station, El-Hakl\r\n(Hagul), backed by tall arenaceous buttresses.\r\n\r\nAfter six hours (= twenty-two knots and a half), we anchored in\r\nthe deep channel, about three-quarters of a kilometre wide, that\r\nseparates the Sinaitic mainland from the northern one of the only\r\ntwo islands known in the 'Akabah Gulf, a scrap of rock crowned\r\nwith picturesque grey ruins. The Jezírat Fara'ún of the maps, the\r\nIsle of Pharaoh, concerning whom traditions are still current, it\r\nis known to the 'Akabites only as Jebel el-Kala'h or \"Fort-hill:\"\r\nhence El-Graa in Laborde, and Jezírat El-Q reieh in\r\nArconati.[EN#124] Burckhardt alone mentions that the ruins are\r\nknown as El-Dayr--\"the Convent.\" This human lair is encircled by\r\nbarrier-reefs of coralline, broad to the south-west and large in\r\nscattered places: eastward they form a shallow wall-like ledge,\r\nbeyond which blue water at once begins. The island-formation is\r\nthat of the opposite coasts, Midian and Sinai, grey granite dyked\r\nwith decaying porphyritic trap, and everywhere veined with white\r\nand various-coloured quartzes. The shape is a long oval of about\r\nthree hundred and twenty by one hundred and fifty-two metres; a\r\nsaddleback with two stony heads, the higher to the north, rising\r\na hundred feet or so above sea-level. Pommel and cantle are\r\nconnected by a low seat, a few yards of isthmus; and the three\r\ndivisions, all strongly marked, bear buildings. The profile from\r\neast and west shows four groups: to the extreme north a tower,\r\nbacked by the castle donjon, on the knob of granite here and\r\nthere scarped; the works upon the thread of isthmus; and the\r\nwalls and bastions crowning the southern knob, which, being\r\nlower, is even more elaborately cut to a perpendicular.\r\n\r\nWe landed upon the eastern side of the islet rock, where the\r\ntrunk of a broken mole is covered in rear by a ruined work. Here,\r\nbeing most liable to attack, the fortifications are strongest;\r\nwhereas on the west side only a single wall, now strewn on the\r\nground, with square Burj at intervals, defends the little\r\nboat-harbour. The latter appears at present in the shape of a\r\nfish-pond, measuring sixty by forty metres; sunk below sea-level,\r\nfed by percolation, and exceedingly salt. To the east of this\r\nwater, black cineraceous earth shows where the smith had been at\r\nwork: we applied the quarrymen to sift it, without other results\r\nbut bits of glass, copper, and iron nails.\r\n\r\nThe pier leads to a covered way, enabling the garrison safely to\r\ncirculate round the base of the islet. Behind it a path, much\r\nbroken and cumbered by débris of the walls, winds up the southern\r\nface of the northern hill, which supports the body of the place:\r\nit meets another track from the west, and a small work defends\r\ntheir junction. Below it, outside the walls, we found a well sunk\r\nabout eight feet in the granite, and cemented with fine lime, the\r\nred plaster in places remaining.  Above this pit a Mihráb, or\r\nprayer-niche, fronting Meccah-wards (more exactly 175 degrees\r\nmag.) shows the now ruinous mosque: the Bedawi declare that it\r\nwas built by a \"Pasha.\" Higher again, upon a terreplein, are\r\nlines of tanks laid out with all that lavishness of labour which\r\ndistinguishes similar works in Syria: it is, however, difficult\r\nto assign any date to these constructions. The cisterns were\r\nexplored by Mr. Clarke and Lieutenant Amir, who dug into and\r\nplanned them. They descended by ropes, although there are two\r\nflights of steps to the west and the south-west. The tanks are\r\nbuilt up from the base with blocks one foot nine inches long:\r\nseven inches deep of rubbish were cleared away before reaching\r\nthe floor, composed of black stones bedded in layers of cement\r\nabove and below, and resting upon the ground-rock. The diggings\r\nyielded only big pieces of salt fallen from the walls, and a\r\nbroken handmill of basalt. The sides are supported by pilasters\r\nof cut stone, and the crown by four pillars in a double row: the\r\ndividing arches, according to the plan, are not symmetrical. Hard\r\nby, measuring twelve metres by twelve, is the quarry whence the\r\nstone was taken; and near it stands the normal Egyptian\r\npigeon-tower, with its nest-niches.\r\n\r\nThe donjon or body is defended by an enceinte, opening northwards\r\nupon a large yard, where, doubtless, the garrison mustered, and\r\nwhence a flight of steps leads to the wicket. The inside of the\r\nworks shows the roofless party-walls still standing; and the\r\nground is scattered over with the remains of many different\r\nraces: there are drums of columns and fragments of marble\r\npillars, but no sign of an inscription. Even in the upper\r\nramparts two epochs are distinctly traceable, the mediæval and\r\nthe modern. The lower ashlar, mostly yellow grit, is cut and\r\ncarefully cemented; the upper part is generally of rough dry\r\nstone, the plutonic formations of the islet heaped up with scanty\r\ncare. The embrasures are framed with decaying palm-trunks; the\r\nloop-holes belong partly to the age of archery; and nothing can\r\nbe ruder than the battlements placed close together, as if to be\r\nmanned by bowmen, while in not a few places there are the remains\r\nof matting between the courses. At the highest part we found\r\nanother carefully cemented Sehrij, or underground cistern, with\r\ntwo sharp-topped arches divided by a tall column, Saracenic\r\ncertainly and not Doric:[EN#125] above it a circular aperture,\r\narched round with the finest bricks, serves to lighten the\r\nsuperstructure. It communicates to the north with a Hammám, whose\r\nplan is easily traced by the double flues and earthenware tubes,\r\nwell made and mortared together. Here we found inscribed on the\r\nplaster, \"Arona Linant 22 Mars 1846.\"\r\n\r\nThe southern knob of the islet supports similar but inferior\r\nconstructions, still more ruinous withal: its quarry is on the\r\nlower slopes, and its granitic base has also been scarped\r\nseawards. Two stout walls, twelve feet thick below and six above,\r\ncrossing the length of the rock from north to south, here meet in\r\na Burj which shows signs of fine tiles on an upper floor; whilst\r\na third wall forms a southern spine bisecting the tail of the\r\n\"Jezírat.\" The castle is much more dilapidated than when sketched\r\nby Ruppell, the first Frank who visited El-'Akabah, in 1826. His\r\nillustration (p. 214) of Ruinen auf der Insel Emrag shows a\r\nsingle compact building in good preservation, the towers being\r\nround, when all are square; and it is garnished with the\r\nimpossible foreground and background of his epoch; the former,\r\nenlivened with a Noah's-Ark camel, being placed quite close, when\r\nit is distant some ten miles. In the German naturalist's time,\r\nthe now desolate island was occupied by die Emradi, a tribe which\r\nhe suspected to be Jewish, and of which he told the queerest\r\ntales: I presume they are the 'Imrám-Huwaytát of El-Hakl and the\r\nHismá. Wellsted's short description (II. ix) is still correct as\r\nin 1838.\r\n\r\nThe castle is evidently European, built during the days when the\r\nCrusaders held El-'Akabah; but it probably rests upon Roman\r\nruins; and the latter, perhaps, upon Egyptian remains of far\r\nolder date. It protected one section of the oldest overland\r\nroute, when the islet formed the key of the Gulf-head. It\r\nsubsequently became an eyrie whence its robber knights and\r\nbarons--including possibly \"John, the Christian ruler of 'Akabah\"\r\n(A.D. 630), and, long after him, madcap Rainald de Chatillon\r\n(A.D. 1182)--could live comfortably and sally out to plunder\r\nmerchants and pilgrims. The Saracenic buildings may date, as the\r\npopular superstition has it, from the reign of Saláh el-Dín\r\n(Saladin) who, in A.D. 1167, cleared his country of the Infidel\r\ninvader by carrying ships on camel-back from Cairo. Later\r\ngenerations of thieves, pirates, and fishermen naturally made it\r\ntheir refuge and abode. I hardly anticipate for it great things\r\nin the immediate future, although it has been proposed for a\r\ncoal-depôt.\r\n\r\nAfter a day given to tube-tinkering with tompions, stays, plugs,\r\nplates, and wedges, to the distraction of the ship's carpenter\r\nand blacksmith, steam was coaxed up; and, at 9.15 a.m. (February\r\n7th), we ran northwards through the deep narrow channel, rounding\r\nthe upper end of the Pharaohnic islet. Here the encircling wall\r\nis defended by two square Burj, to the north-east and to the\r\nnorthwest, flanking what is probably the main entrance. On the\r\nSinaitic mainland to port, the broad mouth of the Wady el-Masri\r\nleads to the Nakb, the rocky Pass which, so much dreaded till\r\nrepaired by Abba's Pasha, is popularly said to be described in\r\nEl-'Akabah--\"the Steep.\" The Bedawin, however, declare that the\r\nlocale is so called because the Gulf here \"heels\" (Ya'kkab\r\nel-Bahr), that is, comes to an end. At the head of the sea, the\r\nconfused mass of the Sinaitic mountains range themselves in line\r\nto the west, fronting its sister wall, the grand block El-Shará'\r\n(Seir); while in the middle lies the southern section of the\r\n\"Ghor,\" the noble and memorious Wady el-'Akabah, supposed to have\r\ngiven a name to Arabia.[EN#126] The surface-water still rolls\r\ndown it after rains; and the mirage veiling the valley-sole\r\nprolongs the Gulf-waters far to the north, their bed in the old\r\ngeologic ages. The view was charming to us; for the first time\r\nsince leaving Suez we saw the contrast of perpendicular and\r\nhorizontal, of height and flat. Nothing could be more refreshing,\r\nmore gladdening to the eye, after niente che montagne, as the\r\npoor Italian described the Morea, than the soft sweeps and the\r\nlevel lines of the hollow plain: it was enjoyable as a heavy\r\nshower after an Egyptian summer. On the next day also, the play\r\nof light and shade, and the hide and seek of sun-ray and\r\nwater-cloud, gave the view a cachet of its own. I am sorry to see\r\nthat scientific geologist, Mr. John Milne, F.G.S.,[EN#127]\r\nproposing to cut through the two to five hundred feet of\r\nelevation which separate the Gulf from the Dead Sea, some\r\nthirteen hundred feet below water level. Does he reflect that he\r\nsimply proposes to obliterate the whole lower Jordan? to bury\r\nTiberias and its lake about eight hundred feet under the waves?\r\nin fact, to overwhelm half the Holy Land in a brand-new\r\nnineteenth-century deluge, the Deluge of Milne?\r\n\r\nAll were delighted at having reached our northernmost point,\r\nwithout another visit from El-Ayli'. After one hour and\r\nthirty-five minutes (= seven miles) the Mukhbir anchored, in\r\ntwelve fathoms of water, a couple of hundred yards off the fort\r\nand its dependent group of brown-grey mud buildings, half\r\nconcealed by the luxuriant palms. The roads are safe enough: here\r\nthe north wind has not yet gained impetus; the south-easter is\r\nbluffed off by a long point; and in only the strongest Gharbí\r\n(\"westers\") ships must run for refuge under the cliffs of Sinai.\r\n\r\nThis is not the place to enter into the history of Elath, Ailat,\r\nAilah, Ælana, 'Akabah, or 'Akabat-Aylah: Robinson (i. 250-254)\r\nand a host of others give ample and reliable details. Suffice it\r\nto say that the site is mentioned in the Wanderings (Deut. ii.\r\n8), which must not be confounded with the Exodus. It is\r\nsubsequently connected with the gold-fleet (I Kings ix. 26,\r\netc.); and, conquered by Rezin, king of Syria (B.C. 740), it was\r\npermanently lost to the Jews (2 Kings xvi. 6). Under the Romans,\r\nthis great station upon the \"Overland\" between the southernmost\r\nNabathæan port, Leukè Kóme, and Petra, the western capital, was a\r\nPræsidium held by the Tenth Legion; and a highway connected it\r\nwith Gaza (Ghazzah), measuring one hundred and twenty direct\r\nmiles, when the Isthmus of Suez numbers only ninety-five. In\r\nChristian times it had a prince and a bishop; and, under Mohammed\r\nand the early Moslems, it preserved an importance which lasted\r\ntill the days of the Crusaders. El-Makrízi describes its ruins,\r\nand here places the northern frontier of the Hejaz: in his day\r\n\"Madyan\" was thus a section of the Tihámat el-Hejaz, the maritime\r\nregion of the Moslems' Holy Land.\r\n\r\nA group of camels had gathered on the shore; and inland lay a mob\r\nof pilgrims, the Hajj el-Magháribah, numbering some three\r\nthousand North-West Africans; an equally large division had\r\nalready preceded them to Suez. Letters from Egypt assured us that\r\ncholera had broken out at Meccah and Jeddah, killing in both\r\nplaces ninety-eight per diem. Here the pilgrims swore by their\r\nAllah that all were, and ever had been, in perfect health; it is\r\nevery man's business to ignore the truth, to hide the sick, and\r\nto bury the dead out of sight. Hard swearing, however, did not\r\nprevent the Hajj undergoing a long quarantine before entering\r\nSuez. The English journals had reported another disaster: \"Now\r\nthat the Sultán's power is collapsing, the most powerful Bedaween\r\ntribes are rising because their subsidies are withheld. For weeks\r\nthe great pilgrim-traffic of autumn (? add the other three\r\nseasons) was arrested by them; and even between Medina and Mecca\r\nthe road is unsafe.\" Of this I could hear nothing.\r\n\r\nWe awaited, on board, the departure of the pauper and infected\r\n\"Mogrebbins:\" when the place was clear we fired a gun, and, after\r\nan answer of three, I received the visits of the fort officials.\r\nThey were civility itself; they immensely admired our two\r\n\"splendid buttons\" of poor iron; and they privily remarked, with\r\nmuch penetration, that the colour was that of brass: they were,\r\nin truth, far wiser than we had been. With them came Mohammed ibn\r\nJád (not Iját) el-'Alawí (of the 'Alawlyyin-Huwaytát), who styles\r\nhimself \"Shaykh of El-'Akabah:\" he is remarkable for frank\r\ncountenance, pleasant manners, and exceeding greed. He was\r\ngorgeously arrayed in an overall ('Abáyah) of red silk and gold\r\nthread (Gasab), covering a similar cloak of black wool: besides\r\nwhich, a long-sleeved Egyptian caftán, striped stuff of silk and\r\nwool, invested his cotton Kamís and Libás (\"bag-breeches\"). To\r\nhis A'kál or \"fillet\" of white fleecy wool hung a talisman; his\r\nKhuff (\"riding-boots\") were of red morocco, and his\r\nsword-scabbard was covered with the same material. The Arab ever\r\nloves scarlet, and all varieties of the sanguine hue are as dear\r\nto him as to the British soldier.\r\n\r\nWe held sundry long confabs with Shaykh Mohammed, who seemed to\r\nknow the neighbourhood unusually well. He declared that there\r\nwere ruins but no trees at 'Ayn el-Ghadya'n, distant one day's\r\nmarch up the Wady el-'Arabah, and lying near the western wall.\r\nThis is the place first identified by Robinson, who says nothing\r\nabout the remains, with Ezion-geber, while Dean Stanley (\"Sinai,\"\r\netc., p. 85) opines that we have no means of fixing the position\r\nof the \"Giant's shoulder-blade.\"[EN#128] Josephus (\"Antiq.,\"\r\nviii. 6, 4) places it near Ælana; and the present distance from\r\nthe sea, like that of Heroopolis (Shaykh el-Ajrúd?) from Suez,\r\nmay show the rise of the Wady el-'Arabah within historic times.\r\nThe Shaykh assured us that \"Marú\" was to be found everywhere\r\namong the hills east of El-'Akabah, and Mr. Milne (Beke, p. 405)\r\nbrought from the very summit of the \"true Mount Sinai\" (Jebel\r\nel-Yitm) a \"fine piece of quartz, the same kind of stone as the\r\nBrazilian pebbles of which they make the best spectacles.\" We\r\ncarried off a specimen of native copper from the Sinaitic Jebel\r\nand Wady Raddádí, some six hours to the north-west of the fort:\r\nit is found strewed upon the ground but not in veins (?). The\r\nstone looked so new that we concluded it to be the work of later\r\ngenerations; and the traces of smelting furnaces at old Elath\r\nconfirmed the idea.\r\n\r\nShaykh Mohammed, who boasted that his tribe could mount five\r\nhundred horses--by which understand five--offered his safeguard\r\nto the Hismá, three easy marches, without pass or climax, up the\r\nWady Yitm to the east, and behind the range El-Shará'. He made\r\nthe region begin northwards at one day south of El-Ma'án, the\r\nfort lying to the east-south-east of Petra; and he confirmed the\r\naccounts of Mabrúk, the guide, who was never tired of expatiating\r\nupon its merits. The fountains flow in winter, in summer the\r\nwells are never dry; the people, especially the Huwaytát, are\r\nkind and hospitable; sheep are cheap as dirt. At Jebel Saur a\r\nMaghrabi magician raised a Kidr Dahab (\"golden pot\"); but, his\r\nincense failing at the critical moment, it sank before yielding\r\nits treasures.\r\n\r\nPointing north-eastwards to the majestic pile in the Shara\" or\r\nSeir Mountains, the Jebel el-Yitm,[EN#129] a corruption of\r\nEl-Yatim, the Shaykh told us a tale that greatly interested us.\r\nIt appears, I have said, a remarkable formation from whose group\r\nof terminal domes and pinnacles the tomb of Aaron on Mount Hor\r\nis,[EN#130] they say, visible; and it is certainly the highest\r\nvisible peak of the grand wall that forms the right bank of the\r\nWady Yitm. Thus it is but one of a long range; and the Bedawin\r\nvisit it, to make sacrifice, according to universal custom, at\r\nthe tomb of a certain Shaykh Bákir. Here, some years ago, came an\r\nold man and a young man in a steamer (Erin) belonging to his\r\nHighness the Khediv: the former told the Arabs that in his books\r\nthe height was called the Jebel el-Núr (\"Mountain of Light\"), a\r\ntitle which apparently he had first applied to the Jebel el-Lauz;\r\nand the latter climbed to the mountain-top. After that they went\r\ntheir way.\r\n\r\nI quite agree with my lamented friend, Dr. Beke, that it is an\r\nenormous blunder to transfer Midian, the \"East Country,\" to the\r\nwest of El-'Arabah, and to place it south of the South Country\r\n(El-Negeb, Gen. xx. I). I own that it is ridiculous to make the\r\nLawgiver lead his fugitives into a veritable cul-de-sac, then a\r\ncentre of Egyptian conquest. Evidently we have still to find the\r\n\"true Mount Sinai,\" if at least it be not a myth, pure and\r\nsimple. The profound Egyptologist, Dr. Heinrich Brugsch-Bey,\r\nobserves that the vulgar official site lies to the south of and\r\nfar from the line taken by the Beni Israil, and that the papyri\r\nshow no route leading to it; whilst many have remarked that the\r\nSinai of the Exodus is described as a single isolated mountain or\r\nhill, not as one projection from a range of heights.[EN#131] I\r\nwould also suggest that the best proof of how empirical is the\r\nactual identification, will be found in the fact that the\r\nJews--except only the Rev. Jos. Wolff (1821)--have never visited,\r\nnor made pilgrimages to, what ought to be one of their holiest of\r\nholy places. This crucial point has been utterly neglected by the\r\nofficers of the Ordnance Survey of Sinai. It is evident that\r\nJebel Serbal dates only from the early days of Koptic\r\nChristianity; that Jebel Musá, its Greek rival, rose after the\r\nvisions of Helena in the fourth century; whilst the building of\r\nthe convent by Justinian belongs to A.D. 527. Ras Sufsafah, its\r\nrival to the north, is an affair of yesterday, and may be called\r\nthe invention of Robinson; and Jebel Katerina, to the south, is\r\nthe property of Ruppell. Thus the oft-quoted legends of the\r\nSinaitic Arabs are mere monkish traditions, adopted by\r\nIshmaelitic ignorance. The great Lawgiver probably led his horde\r\nof fugitive slaves over the plains of El-Negeb and El-Tih, north\r\nof the so-called Sinaitic mountain-blocks, marching in small\r\ndivisions like those of a modern Bedawi tribe; and we know from\r\nthe latest surveys that the land, now alternately a fiery or\r\nfrozen wilderness, was once well supplied with wood and water.\r\nThe \"true Mount Sinai\" is probably some unimportant elevation in\r\nthe Desert named by moderns after the Wanderings.\r\n\r\nDr. Beke, I am persuaded, is right in denying that Mount Sinai\r\noccupies the site at present assigned to it; but I cannot believe\r\nthat he has found it in the Jebel el-Yitm, near El-'Akabah. His\r\n\"Mount Bárghir\" is evidently a corruption of the \"Wali\" on the\r\nsummit, Shaykh Bákir--a common Arab name. His \"Mountain of Light\"\r\nis a term wholly unknown to the Arabs, except so far as they\r\nwould assign the term to any saintly place. The \"sounds heard in\r\nthe mountain like the firing of a cannon,\" is a legend applied to\r\ntwo other neighbouring places. All the Bedawin still sacrifice at\r\nthe tombs of their Santons: at the little white building which\r\ncovers the reputed tomb of Aaron, sheep are slaughtered and\r\nboiled in a huge black cauldron. The \"pile of large rounded\r\nboulders\" bearing \"cut Sinaitic inscriptions\" (p. 423) are\r\nclearly Wusúm: these tribal-marks, which the highly imaginative\r\nM. de Saulcy calls \"planetary signs,\" are found throughout\r\nMidian. The name of the Wady is, I have said, not El-Ithem, but\r\nEl-Yitm, a very different word. Lastly, the \"Mountain Eretówa,\"\r\nor \"Ertówa\" (p. 404), is probably a corruption of El-Taur\r\n(El-Hismá), the \"inaccessible wall\" of the plateau, which Dr.\r\nBeke calls Jebel Hismá. My old friend, with his usual candour and\r\nstraightforwardness, honestly admitted that he had been\r\n\"egregiously mistaken with respect to the volcanic character of\r\n(the true) 'Mount Sinai.\"' But without the eruption, the \"fire\r\nand smoke theory,\" what becomes of his whole argument?[EN#132]\r\nSave for the death of my friend, I should have greatly enjoyed\r\nthe comical side of his subject; the horror and disgust with\r\nwhich he, one of the greatest of geographical innovators, regards\r\na younger rival theory, the exodist innovation of Dr. Heinrich\r\nBrugsch-Bey. The latter is the first who has rescued the \"March\r\nof the Children of Israel\" from the condition of mere guesswork\r\ndescribed by the Rev. Mr. Holland.\r\n\r\nUnder the guidance of our new acquaintances, we rowed to the site\r\nof Elath, which evidently extended all round the Gulf-head from\r\nnorth-east to north-west. Linant and Laborde (\"Voyage de l'Arabie\r\nPetrée,\" etc., Paris, 1830) confine it to the western shore, near\r\nthe mouth of the Wady el-'Arabah, and make Ezion-geber to face it\r\nas suggested by the writings of the Hebrews. Disembarking at the\r\nnorthern palm-clump, we inspected El-Dár, the old halting-place\r\nof the pilgrim-caravan before New 'Akabah was founded. The only\r\nruins[EN#133] are large blocks under the clearest water, and off\r\na beach of the softest sand, which would make the fortune of a\r\nbathing-place in Europe. Further eastward lies an enclosed\r\ndate-orchard called El-Hammám: the two pits in it are said to be\r\nwells, but I suspect the treasure-seeker. Inland and to the north\r\nrise the mounds and tumuli, the sole remains of ancient Elath,\r\nonce the port of Petra, which is distant only two dromedary\r\nmarches. During rain-floods the site is an island: to the west\r\nflows the surface-water of the Wady el-'Arabah, and eastward the\r\ndrainage of the Wady Yitm has dug a well-defined bed. A line of\r\nlarger heaps to the north shows where, according to the people,\r\nran the city wall: finding it thickly strewed with scoriae, old\r\nand new, I decided that this was the Siyághah or \"smiths'\r\nquarter.\" Between it and the sea the surface is scattered with\r\nglass, shards, and slag: I inquired in vain for \"written stones,\"\r\nand for the petroleum reported to exist in the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nShaykh Mohammed declared that of old a chain stretched from the\r\nPharaohnic island-castle to the Jebel el-Burayj or Kasr el-Bedawi\r\non the Midianite shore: this chain is a lieu commun of Eastern\r\nlegends. The \"Bedawi's Castle\" is mentioned by Robinson and\r\nBurckhardt (\"Syria,\" p. 510), as lying one hour south of\r\nEl-'Akabah. Moreover, the Wady Yitm, whose upper bed shows two\r\nruins, was closed, at the narrow above the mouth, by a fortified\r\nwall of stone and lime, thus cutting off all intercourse with the\r\ninterior. The Bedawin declare it to be the work of King Hadíd\r\n(Iron), who thus kept out the Bení Hilál of El-Nejd. We were\r\nshown large earth-dams, thrown across the embouchure of the\r\ntorrent to prevent the floods injuring the palm-groves of New\r\n'Akabah. These may date from ancient days, when the old city here\r\nextended its south-eastern suburb; as usual, they have become a\r\ncemetery, modern and Moslem; and on the summit of the largest the\r\nholy Shaykh el-Girmí (Jirmí) still names his ruined tomb.\r\n\r\nWalking round the eastern bay, where the ubiquitous black sand\r\nstriped the yellow shore, we observed that the tide here rises\r\nonly one foot,[EN#134] whereas at Suez it may reach a metre and a\r\nhalf to seven feet. According to the chart, the springs attain\r\nfour feet at \"Omeider\" (El-Humayzah), some nineteen direct knots\r\nto the south; and in the Sharm Yáhárr we found them about one\r\nmetre. Presently we entered, by wooden doors with locks and keys,\r\nthe carefully kept palm-groves, walled with pisé and dry stone.\r\nWells were being sunk; and a depth of nine to ten feet gave\r\ntolerably sweet water. Striking the broad northern trail which\r\nleads to the Wady Yitm and to the upper El-'Arabah, still a\r\nfavourite camping-ground of the tribes,[EN#135] we reached the\r\nmodern settlement, which has something of the aspect of a\r\ntownlet, not composed, like El-Muwaylah, of a single house. The\r\nwomen fled at our approach, as we threaded the alleys formed by\r\nthe mud tenements.\r\n\r\nThe fort[EN#136] is usually supposed to have been built by\r\nSulta'n Selim I., in A.D. 1517, or three years before his death,\r\nafter he had subdued the military aristocracy of the Mamlúks, who\r\nhad ruled Egypt for three centuries. Much smaller than that of\r\nEl-Muwaylah, it is the normal affair: an enceinte once striped\r\nred and white; curtains flanked by four Burj, all circular,\r\nexcept the new polygon to the north-west; and a huge, gloomy\r\nmain-gateway fronting north, and flanked by two bastions. On the\r\nproper right side is a circle of stone bearing, without date, the\r\nname of \"Sultán Selim Khan el-Fátih,\" who first laid out the\r\npilgrim-route along the Red Sea shore. Inside the dark cool porch\r\na large inscription bears the name \"El-Ashraf Kansúr\r\n(sic)[EN#137] El-Ghori,\" the last but one of the Circassian\r\nMamlúk kings of Egypt, who was defeated and slain by the Turkish\r\nconqueror near Aleppo in A.D. 1501. Above it stand two stone\r\nshields dated A.H. 992 (= A.D. 1583--1584). In the southern wall\r\nof the courtyard is the mosque, fronted by a large deep well dug,\r\nthey say, during the building of the fort: it still supplies the\r\nwhole Hajj-caravan with warmish sweet water. On the ground lies a\r\ngood brass gun with Arabic inscription and numerals; and the\r\ntowers, commanding the little kitchen-gardens outside the\r\nfort-wall, are armed with old iron carronades. The garrison,\r\nconsisting of half a dozen gunners and a few Ba'sh-Buzuks, looks\r\npale, bloodless, and unwholesome: the heats of summer are almost\r\nunsupportable; and 'Akabah has the name of a \"little hell.\"\r\nMoreover, they eat, drink, smoke, sleep, chat, quarrel, and never\r\ntake exercise: the officers complained sadly that I had made them\r\nwalk perhaps a mile round the bay-head. And yet they have, within\r\ntwo days of sharp ride, that finest of sanitaria, the Hismá,\r\nwhich extends as far north and south as they please to go.\r\n\r\nI at once made arrangements for a dromedary-post to Suez, and\r\nwrote officially to Prince Husayn Pasha, requesting that his\r\nHighness would exchange the Mukhbir for a steamer less likely to\r\ndrown herself. Moreover, the delay at Magháir Shu'ayb had\r\nexhausted our resources; and the Expedition required a month's\r\nadditional rations for men and mules. The application was, it\r\nwill appear, granted in the most gracious manner, with as little\r\ndelay as possible; and my wife, who had reached Cairo, saw that\r\nthe execution of the order was not put off till the end of March.\r\nMessrs. Voltéra Brothers were also requested to forward another\r\ninstalment of necessaries and comforts; and they were as punctual\r\nand satisfactory as before. For this postal service, and by way\r\nof propitiatory present, Shaykh Mohammed received ten dollars, of\r\nwhich probably two were disbursed. We therefore parted fast\r\nfriends, he giving me an especial invitation to his home in the\r\nHismá, and I accepting it with the firm intention of visiting him\r\nas soon as possible.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Mr. Clarke and Ali Marie were busy with buying up such\r\nstores as El-'Akabah contains; and the officers of the fort, who\r\nstayed with us to the last, were profuse in kind expressions and\r\nin little gifts which, as usual, cost us double their worth. In\r\nthese lands one must expect to be \"done\" as surely as in Italy.\r\nWhat the process will be, no one knows till it discloses itself;\r\nbut all experts feel that it is in preparation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE ON THE SUPPLIES TO BE BOUGHT AT EL-'AKABAH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following is a list of the stores with their prices. It must\r\nbe borne in mind that the Hajj-caravan was passing at the time we\r\nvisited El-'Akabah.\r\n\r\nA large sheep cost half a napoleon; the same was the price of a\r\nsmall sheep, with a kid.\r\n\r\nFowls (seventy-one bought), thirteen pence each; pigeons,\r\nsixpence a head.\r\n\r\nEggs (sixty), two for threepence.\r\n\r\nTobacco (8 lbs.), coarse and uncut, but welcome to the Bedawin,\r\none shilling per pound.\r\n\r\nSamn (\"liquefied butter\" for the kitchen) also one shilling per\r\npound. This article is always dear in Arabia, but much cheaper\r\nthan in Egypt.\r\n\r\nPomegranates (fifty), four shillings a hundred.\r\n\r\nOnions (one kanta'r or cwt.), one sovereign.\r\n\r\nThin-skinned Syrian raisins, fivepence per pound.\r\n\r\nDried figs, twopence halfpenny per pound.\r\n\r\nMatches (sixteen boxes), three halfpence per box.\r\n\r\nA small quantity of grain may be bought. Lentils (Revalenta\r\nArabica) are to be had in any quantity, and they make an\r\nadmirable travelling soup. Unfortunately it is supposed to be a\r\nfood for Fellahs, and the cook shirks it--the same is the case\r\nwith junk, salt pork, and pease-pudding on board an English\r\ncruiser. Sour limes are not yet in season; they will be plentiful\r\nin April. A little garden stuff may be had for salads. The list\r\nof deficiencies is great; including bread and beef, potatoes,\r\n'Ráki, and all forms of \"diffusable stimulants.\"\r\n\r\nHere, as at Cairo, the piastre is of two kinds, metallic (debased\r\nsilver) and non-metallic. Government pays in the former, which is\r\ncalled Ságh (\"coin\"); and the same is the term throughout Egypt.\r\nThe value fluctuates, but 97-1/2 may be assumed = one sovereign\r\n(English), and one hundred to the Egyptian \"lira.\" The second\r\nkind, used for small purchases, is not quite half the value of\r\nthe former (205:100); in North-Western Arabia it is called Abyas\r\n(\"white\"), and Tarífá (\"tariff\"); the latter term in Cairo always\r\nsignifying the Ságh or metallic. The dodges of the Shroffs, or\r\n\"money-changers,\" make housekeeping throughout Egypt a study of\r\narithmetic. They cannot change the value of gold, but they \"rush\"\r\nthe silver as they please; and thus the \"dollar-sinko\" (i.e. the\r\nfive-franc piece), formerly fetching 19.10, has been reduced to\r\n18.30. The Khurdah, or \"copper-piastre,\" was once worth a\r\npiastre; now this \"coin of the realm\" has been so debased, that\r\nit has gradually declined through 195 to 500 and even 650 for the\r\nsovereign. Moreover, not being a legal tender, it is almost\r\nuseless in the market.\r\n\r\nAs regards the money to be carried by such expeditions, anything\r\ncurrent in Egypt will do. The Bedawin prefer sovereigns when\r\noffered five-franc pieces, and vice versa. The Egyptian sovereign\r\nof 100 piastres (metallic) or 250 \"current\" must not be\r\nconfounded with the Turkish = 87.30 (curr. 175.20 to 180). The\r\nnapoleon averages 77.6 (curr. 160); the dollar varies according\r\nto its kind; the shilling is 3.35 (curr. 10), and the franc 3.35\r\n(curr. 8). It is necessary to lay in a large quantity of small\r\nchange by way of \"bakhshísh,\" such as ten and twenty parah bits\r\n(40 = 1 piastre).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Chapter VIII.\r\n      Cruise from El-'Akabah to El-Muwaylah--the Shipwreck\r\n            EscapedRésumé of the Northern Journey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI resolved upon hastening back with all speed to El-Muwaylah,\r\nfinishing, by the way, our work of quartz-prospecting on the\r\n'Akabah Gulf. Thus far it had been a success; we heard of \"Marú\"\r\nin all directions. But all had not gone equally well. We had\r\nalready on two occasions been prevented by circumstances from\r\nvisiting the mysterious Hismá, and we now determined to devote\r\nall our energies to its exploration.\r\n\r\nTwo heavy showers having fallen during the dark hours, on\r\nFebruary 8th Aurora looked as if she had passed a very bad night\r\nindeed. The mist-rack trailed along the rock slopes, and rested\r\nupon the Wady-sands; the mountains veiled their heads in clouds,\r\nand--\r\n\r\n     \"Above them lightnings to and fro ran coursing evermore,\r\n          Till, like a red, bewildered map, the skies were\r\nscribbled o'er.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in the north-west and south-west we saw--rare thing in\r\nArabia!--Iris holding two perfect bows at the same time, not to\r\nspeak of \"wind dogs.\" Zephyrus, the wester, here a noted bad\r\ncharacter, rose from his rocky couch strong and rough, beating\r\ndown the mercury to 56 degrees F.: after an hour he made way for\r\nEurus; and the latter was presently greeted by Boreas in one of\r\nhis most boisterous and blustering moods.\r\n\r\nWe steamed off, with only a single stoppage for half an hour to\r\ncool the engine-bearings, at 7.30 a.m.; and, after one mile we\r\npassed, on the Arabian side, a ruin called Kasr el-Bint--\"the\r\nGirl's Palace.\" Beyond it lies the Kasr el-Bedawi, alias\r\nEl-Burayj (\"of the Little Tower or Bastion\"), the traditional\r\nholding-pier of the great chain. When Wellsted (ii. 146) says,\r\n\"Here (i.e. at the Kasr el-Bedawi), I am told, there is a chain\r\nextending from the shore to a pier built in the sea\"--he\r\nevidently misunderstood the Arabs. The eastern coast of\r\nEl-'Akabah begins with an abrupt mountain-wall, like that which\r\nsubtends the whole of the Sinai shore, till it trends south of\r\nthe Mí'nat el-Dahab. After three miles the heights fall into a\r\nstony, sandy plain, which rises regularly as a \"rake,\" or\r\nstage-slope, to the Shará' (Seir) range, which closes the\r\nhorizon. After two hours and forty five minutes we passed into\r\nthe fine, open, treacherous Bay of \"Hagul\" (El-Hakl), distant\r\nthirteen knots from El-'Akabah Fort, to which it is the nearest\r\ncaravan-station. On the north-east, and stretching eastward, are\r\nthe high \"horse,\" or dorsum, and the big buttresses of the long,\r\nbroad Wady, which comes winding from the south-east. They appear\r\nto be a body of sand; but, as usual on this coast, the\r\nsuperficial sheet, the skin, hardly covers the syenite and\r\nporphyritic trap that form the charpente. Between west and south,\r\na long spit, high inland, and falling low till where its\r\nsandstone blufflet meets the sea, proves to be the base of a\r\nlarge and formidable reef, which extends in verdigris patches\r\nover the blue waters of the bay. It is not mentioned by Wellsted\r\n(ii. 149), who describes \"Ha'gool on the Arabian shore,\" as \"a\r\nsmall boat-harbour much exposed to the northerly winds.\" The\r\nembouchure of the Wady nourishes four distinct clumps of\r\ndate-trees, well walled round; a few charred and burnt, the most\r\nof them green and luxuriant. These lines are broken by the\r\nchannels which drain the surface water; and between the two\r\nwestern sections appear the ragged frond-huts. Not a soul was\r\nseen on shore.\r\n\r\nThe wind blew great guns outside the bay, and the inside proved\r\nanything but calm. As the water was fifty-eight fathoms deep near\r\nthe coast, our captain found no moorings for his ship, except to\r\nthe dangerous reef; and we kept drifting about in a way which\r\nwould have distracted sensitive nerves. I had been told of ruins\r\nand tumuli at El-Hakl, which denote, according to most\r\nauthorities, the Mesogeian town <Greek>(Ancale): Ptolemy\r\n(vi. 7, 27) places this oppidum Mediterraneum between Mákna or\r\nMaína (Madyan), and Madiáma (Magháir Shu'ayb), the old capital.\r\n\r\nUnwilling, however, to risk the safety of the gunboat, where\r\nnothing was to be expected beyond what we had seen at El-'Akabah,\r\nI resolved, after waiting half an hour, not to land. The Sambúk\r\nreceived a cargo of quarrymen and sacks, in order to ship at\r\nMakná the \"argentiferous galena\" and other rocks left by\r\nLieutenant Yusuf and M. Philipin upon the shore; and, that done,\r\nshe was directed to rejoin us at Tírán Island. As long as the\r\nnorther coursed high, she beat us hollow; in the afternoon,\r\nhowever, when the gale, as usual, abated, she fell off, perhaps\r\npurposely, not wishing to pass a night in the open. By sunset her\r\nwhite sail had clean disappeared, having slipped into some snug\r\ncove.\r\n\r\nThe Arabian shore is here of simpler construction than that of\r\nSinai; consequently the chart has had a better chance. The\r\nMukhbir resumed her way southwards in glorious weather, a fresh\r\nbreath blowing from the north; and fleecy clouds variegating the\r\nsky, which was almost as blue as the waves After six miles and a\r\nhalf from El-Hakl and nearly twenty from El-Akabah, she ran to\r\nthe west of El-Humayzah Island, the \"Omasír\" of Wellsted (ii.\r\n149), between which and the mainland is a well sheltered berth.\r\nIt is a great contrast with the \"Hill of the Fort,\" the\r\nPharaohnic rock, this lump some eighty feet high, built of\r\nSecondary gypsum and yellow serpentine like the coast behind it.\r\nGleaming deadly white, pale as a corpse in the gorgeous sunshine,\r\nand utterly bare, except for a single shrub, it is based upon a\r\nbroad, dark-coloured barrier-reef. Local tradition here places\r\nthe Kasr el-Bedawíyyah, \"Palace of the Bedawi Woman (or Girl),\"\r\nbut we saw neither sign of building nor trace of population in\r\nthe second island which the Gulf el-'Akabah owns.\r\n\r\nWe then passed sundry uninteresting features, and night fell upon\r\nus off Jebel Tayyib Ism, where familiar scenes began to present\r\nthemselves. The captain had already reduced speed from four and a\r\nhalf to three knots, his object being to reach the Bugház or\r\n\"Gulf-mouth\" after dawn. But as midnight drew near it became\r\nnecessary to ride out the furious gale with the gunboat's head\r\nturned northwards. M. Lacaze, a stout-hearted little man, worked\r\nhalf the night at the engine, assisting Mr. Duguid. About four\r\na.m. (February 8th) a lull in the storm allowed her to resume her\r\nsoutherly course; but two hours afterwards, an attempt to make\r\nthe Makná shore, placing her broadside on to the wind, created\r\nmuch confusion in the crockery and commotion among the men.\r\nAlways a lively craft, she now showed a Vokes-like agility; for,\r\nas is ever the case, she had no ballast, and who would take the\r\ntrouble to ship a few tons of sand? At such moments the engine\r\nwas our sole stand-by: had it played one of its usual tricks, the\r\nMukhbir, humanly speaking, was lost; that is, she would have been\r\nswamped and water-logged. As for setting sail, it was not till\r\nour narrow escape that I could get the canvas out of stowage in\r\nthe hold.\r\n\r\nAs the morning wore on the Gulf became even rougher, with its\r\ndeep and hollow waves; they seemed to come from below, as if bent\r\nupon hoisting us in the air. The surface-water shivered; and the\r\nupper spray was swept off by the north wind, which waxed colder\r\nand more biting as we steered sunwards. The Sinaitic side now\r\nshowed its long slopes; and at 9.45 a.m. we passed the palms of\r\nthe Nebíkí anchorage, some six miles from the \"Gate.\" On the\r\nshore of Midian, south of the dark Fahísát Mountains, four\r\nseveral buttresses of gypsum, decreasing in size as they followed\r\none another eastwards, trended diagonally away from the sea. This\r\npart of the Arabian coast ends in a thin point: the maps call it\r\n\"Ras Fartak;\" and the pilots \"Shaykh Hamí,\"[EN#138] from a holy\r\nman's tomb to which pious visitation is made. The other\r\nland-tongue, adjoining to the south, is known as the Umm Ruús, or\r\n\"Mother of Heads.\" I cannot find out whence Ruppell borrowed his\r\n\"Omel Hassanie\" (Umm el-Hassání?).\r\n\r\nAs we approached the ugly gape of the formidable Gulf, the waves\r\nincreased in size, and coursed to all directions, as if distorted\r\nby the sunken reefs. The eastern jamb is formed by Tírán Island;\r\nthe western by the sandy Ras Nasráni, whose glaring tawny slope\r\nis dotted with dark basaltic cones, detached and disposed like\r\ngreat ninepins. Beyond this cape the Sinaitic coast, as far as\r\nRas Mohammed, the apex of the triangle, is fretted with little\r\nindentations; hence its name, El-Shurúm--\"the Creeks.\" Near one\r\nof these baylets, Wellsted chanced upon \"volcanic rocks which are\r\nnot found in any other part of the peninsula:\" this sporadic\r\noutbreak gives credibility to the little \"Harrah\" reported to be\r\nfound upon the bank of the Midianitish \"Wady Sukk.\" A hideous,\r\nhorrid reef, dirty brown and muddy green, with white horses madly\r\ncharging the black diabolitos, whose ugly heads form chevaux de\r\nfrise, a stony tongue based upon Tírán Island, and apparently\r\nconnected from the eastern coast behind, extends its tip to\r\nmid-channel. The clear way of the dreaded Bugház is easily found\r\nin the daytime: at night it would be almost impossible; and when\r\nMidian shall be \"rehabilitated,\" this reef will require a Pharos.\r\n\r\nAdieu, small spitfire of a Gulf! The change from the inside to\r\nthe outside of the Birkat el-Akabah was magical. We at once\r\nglided into summer seas, a mosaic of turquoise and amethyst,\r\nfanned by the softest of breezes, the thermometer showing on deck\r\n63 deg F. Perhaps the natural joy at our lucky escape from\r\n\"making a hole in the water\" caused the beauties of the weather\r\nand the glories of the scenery to appear doubly charming. Our\r\ncaptain might have saved fifteen miles by taking the short cut\r\nnorth of Tírán Island, under whose shelter we required a day for\r\nboiler-tinkering. His pilot, however, would not risk it, and we\r\nwere compelled, nothing loth and little knowing what we did, to\r\nround for a second time the western and southern shores.\r\n\r\nThe \"Hill of Birds,\" which some have identified with the\r\nclassical Island of Isis,[EN#139] shows a triune profile, what\r\nthe Brazilians call a Moela or \"gizzard.\" Of its three peaks the\r\nlowest is the eastern; and the central is the highest, reaching\r\nseven hundred, not a thousand, feet. Viewed from within the Gulf,\r\nit is a slope of sand which has been blown in sheets up the\r\nbacking hills. The ground plan, as seen from a balloon, would\r\nrepresent a round head to the north, a thin neck, and a body\r\nrudely triangular, the whole measuring a maximum of five miles in\r\nlength: the sandy northern circlet, connected by the narrowest of\r\nisthmuses, sweeping eastward, forms the noted port. The material\r\nis the normal Secondary formation, sulphates and carbonates of\r\nlime supporting modern corallines and conglomerates of shell.\r\nHorizontal lines of harder stone are disposed in huge steps or\r\nroads that number three to six on the flank of the western peak:\r\nthe manganese-coloured strata which appeared at Magháir Shu'ayb,\r\nand in the rent bowels of the Rughámat Makná, are conspicuous\r\nfrom the south. The whole has been upheaved by syenite, which,\r\nagain, has been cut by dykes of plutonic stone, trap and\r\nporphyry.\r\n\r\nAt two p.m. we anchored in a roadstead to the south-east of the\r\nisland, open to every wind except the norther. I had sent\r\nLieutenant Amir and sundry quarrymen ashore, to inspect what\r\nlooked like a vein of sulphur. They delayed two hours, instead of\r\na few minutes; the boiler was grumbling for rest, and, not\r\nwishing to leave them adrift in an open boat, I imprudently\r\nconsented to await them in a roadstead where the coast was\r\ndangerous, instead of proceeding, as had been intended, to the\r\nfine land-locked port, nature-hollowed in the eastern side of the\r\nisland. The old captain pitifully represented to me that his crew\r\ncould not row; and this I found to be generally the case: ten\r\nmiles with the oar would be considered a terrible corvée by the\r\nEgyptian man-o'-war's man.\r\n\r\nAfter blowing off steam, we at once went a-fishing. The only\r\nremarkable result was the discovery that this corner of the Red\r\nSea is a breeding-ground for sharks: we had not seen one in the\r\nGulf of El-'Akabah, where last April they swarmed. Here, however,\r\nthe school contained all sizes and every age, and they regarded\r\nus curiously with their cat's eyes, large, dark, and\r\nyellow-striped down the middle. A small specimen, that had just\r\ncut its teeth, was handed over to the cook, despite his loudly\r\nexpressed disgust. The meat was somewhat mealy and shortfibred;\r\nbut we pronounced in committee the seadog to be thoroughly\r\neatable when corrected by pepper, garlic, and Worcester sauce.\r\nThe corallines near the shore were finely developed: each bunch,\r\nlike a tropical tree, formed a small zoological museum; and they\r\nsupplied a variety of animalculae, including a tiny shrimp. The\r\nevening saw a well-defined halo encircling the moon at a\r\nconsiderable distance; and Mr. Duguid quoted the Scotch saw--\r\n\r\n     \"A far-awa' bruch's a near-awa' blast.\"\r\n\r\nThe blast was nearer than we expected; and, during the rest of\r\nthe journey, the \"bruch\" rarely if ever deceived us. Yet the\r\nnight was not much disturbed by the furious northerly gusts,\r\nshowing that the storm which we had escaped was raging in the\r\nstill-vexed 'Akabah.\r\n\r\nNext morning we landed to the south-west of Tírán's easternmost\r\npeak, with a view of prospecting and adding to our collections.\r\nOn the shore, about three hundred feet from the sea, is a bank of\r\ndead shells which are not found on the northern or sandy end of\r\nthe island: near the water most of them are tenanted by paguri\r\n(\"hermits\"). We caught a number of crabs and small fish, and we\r\ncarried off a single rock-oyster: as yet we had not found out\r\nthat the Ustrída--the vulgar form of the Hellenic and classical\r\n\"Istiridiyá\"--abounds in these seas. After thirty minutes' walk\r\nup the southern plane of the prism, composed of gypseous and\r\ncoralline rocks, veins of white petrosilex resembling broken\r\ncolumels, streaks of magnetic black sand, and scatters of grit\r\nand harder stones, we reached the summit of the little ridge. It\r\nafforded a fine bird's-eye view of the splendid middle port; of\r\nthe false harbour; of the real shoal to its south-east, and of\r\nthe basin which seems to form Sináfir Island.\r\n\r\nWe now bent to the south-west. Here the surface is much cut and\r\nbroken by sandy Wadys, dotted with a few straggling plants: to\r\nour right was a Goz or inclined arenaceous bank, where the south\r\nwind had sifted the sand from the gravel, disposing the former in\r\nthe hollows, and the latter on the crest of the ripples.\r\nPresently we reached a strange formation which, seen from the\r\neast, appears a huge vein, red and rusty, beginning close to the\r\nsea, and crossing the body of the island from south to north,\r\nwhile a black cone is so disposed that its southern front\r\nsimulates a crater. A narrow gorge opens upon a semicircular\r\nhollow lined with ochraceous or ferruginous matter; in fact, part\r\nof the filon, which sends off fibrils in all directions. The\r\nconfusion of formations was startling. The floor was here of\r\nwhite petrosilex, there of grey granite, variegated with squares\r\nand lozenges, drops and pineapples, red, green, neutral tinted,\r\nand disposed by oxides of iron and copper in natural designs that\r\nlooked artificial. Scattered over the bed of the upper ravine\r\nbeyond the hollow, were carbonates of lime, ruddy brown and\r\nchocolate-hued, here a pudding-stone, there porous like basalt:\r\nthe calcareous sulphates were both amorphous and crystalline, the\r\nlatter affected by contact with plutonic matter. The walls of the\r\ngash showed a medley of clay breccias, disposed in every\r\nimaginable way; and divided by horizontal veins of heat-altered\r\nquartz. A few paces further led to the head of the ravine, where\r\na tumble of huge rocks, choking the bed, showed that the\r\nrain-torrents must at times be violent.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Mr. Clarke and Lieutenant Amir had walked to the large\r\ncentral harbour, hoping there to hit upon sweet water and some\r\nstray Hutaym fishermen, who would show us what we wanted. They\r\ndid not find even the vestige of a hut. The two exploring parties\r\nsaw only three birds in the \"Isle of Birds,\" and not one of the\r\nvenomous snakes mentioned at \"Tehran\" by Wellsted (II. ix.), and\r\ndescribed as \"measuring about thirty inches, of a slender form,\r\nwith black and white spots.\" We also utterly failed to discover\r\nthe sulphur which was once abundant and the naphtha which,\r\naccording to the same authority, was produced here in\r\nconsiderable quantities, and was used \"by the Arab mariners to\r\npay their boats.\"\r\n\r\nThe evening was exceptionally fine and calm; and we expected on\r\nthe morrow (February 11th) a quiet return to El-Muwaylah. Yet a\r\nmanner of presentiment induced me to summon the engineer and his\r\nnative assistants, and to promise the latter a liberal\r\n\"bakhshísh,\" if by hard work at the boiler all night, and by\r\nrigging up the ship's pump instead of a donkey-engine, they could\r\nsteam off at dawn.\r\n\r\nUnexpectedly, about four a.m., a violent sandy and misty wester\r\nbegan to blow; and all fancied that we had set sail to the south.\r\nQuite the contrary! The engine was still under repair. The\r\nMukhbir was being tossed and rolled by the inshore set, and the\r\nsequel is quickest told by an extract from my \"Penny\":--\r\n\r\n\"Written in sight of Death. Wind roaring furiously for victims:\r\nwaves worse. No chain can stand these sledge-hammer shocks. Chain\r\nparts,[EN#140] and best sheet-anchor with it. Bower and kedge\r\nanchors thrown out and drag. Fast stranding broadside on: sharp\r\ncoralline reef to leeward, distant 150 yards. Sharks! Packed up\r\nnecessaries. Sambúk has bolted, and quite right too! Engine\r\nstarts some ten minutes before the bump. Engineer admirably cool;\r\nnever left his post for a moment, even to look at the sea. Giorgi\r\n(cook) skinning a sheep: he has been wrecked four times, and\r\ndon't care. Deck-pump acting poorly. Off in very nick of time,\r\n9.15 a.m. General joy, damped by broadside turned to huge\r\nbillows. Lashed down boxes of specimens on deck, and wore round\r\nsafely. Made for Sináfir, followed by waves threatening to poop\r\nus. Howling wind tears mist to shreds. Second danger worse than\r\nfirst. Run into green water: fangs of naked rock on both sides\r\nwithin biscuit-throw; stumps show when the waves yawn. Nice\r\nposition for a band-box of old iron! With much difficulty slipped\r\ninto blue water. Rounded south end of spit, and turned north into\r\nglorious Sináfir Bay. Safe anchorage in eight fathoms. Anchor\r\ndown at 10:15 a.m., after one hour of cold sweat. Distance seven\r\nmiles on chart, nine by course: Mukhbir never went so fast; blown\r\nlike chaff before wind. Faces cleared up. All-round shaking of\r\nhands; El-Hamdu li'lláhi,' followed by a drink. Some wept for\r\njoy.\"\r\n\r\nThe engine, or rather the engineer, had saved us: as the saying\r\nis, it was touch and go--the nearest thing I ever did see. Had\r\nthe rotten old boiler struck work for five minutes when we were\r\nclearing out of Tírán, or steaming along Sináfir shore, nothing\r\ncould have kept the ship afloat. Those who behaved best, a\r\nfireman, a boy who crept into the combustion-chamber to clear it,\r\nand helmsman who, having been at Liverpool, spoke a little\r\nEnglish, were duly \"bakhshísh'd.\" The same reward was given by\r\nmistake to the boilermaker, Mohammed Sa'íd Haddád, who had\r\nmalingered, instead of working, through the night. At Suez he had\r\nthe impudence to ask me for a Shahádah (\"testimony\") to his good\r\ncharacter. On the whole the conduct of the crew was worthy of all\r\npraise.\r\n\r\nIn a decently equipped English steamer we should have laughed at\r\nthis storm, and whistled for more wind; but the condition of the\r\nMukhbir quite changed the case. The masts might have rolled out,\r\nor she might have sprung a leak at any moment. And supposing that\r\nwe had escaped the crash upon the reef, the huge waves, and the\r\nschools of sharks, our situation would have been anything but\r\npleasant. The Island of Tírán, as has been shown, is a grisly\r\nscrap of desert: it has no sweet water; and its three birds would\r\nnot long have satisfied thirty hungry men. It is far from the\r\nmainland; the storm, which lasted through two days, was too\r\nviolent for raft or boat to live, and at so early a season native\r\ncraft are never seen on these seas. Briefly, a week might have\r\nelapsed before our friends at El-Muwaylah, who were startled by\r\nthe wildness of the wind, could have learned our plight, or could\r\nhave taken measures to relieve the castaways.\r\n\r\nSináfir Island, which we have to thank for giving us hospitality\r\non two occasions, consists mainly of a bay. Viewed by the norma\r\nverticalis, it is shaped like an ugly duckling, with an oval\r\n(Wellsted says a circular) body of high ground disposed\r\nnorth-east to south-west; and with head and neck drooping\r\nwestward so as to form a mighty pier or breakwater. The watery\r\nplain within is out of all proportion to the amount of terra\r\nfirma. The body-profile shows straight-backed heaps of gypsum,\r\nsome two hundred feet high, which become quoin-shaped about the\r\nmiddle of the isle: these hillocks are connected by low strips of\r\nsand growing the usual vegetation, especially the pink Statice\r\npruinosa.\r\n\r\nPresently our Sambúk, which had also lost chain and anchor before\r\nshe could run out of the storm, appeared to the north-west of the\r\nbay; and a pilgrim-craft, bound for Suez, was our companion in\r\ngood fortune. A party landed to examine Sináfir, which still\r\nshows signs of a junction with Tírán. In days when the Secondary\r\nformation was an unbroken street, the whole segment of a circle,\r\nextending from Sharm Yáhárr to northern Sinai, must have been dry\r\nland; these reefs and islands are now the only remnants. The\r\nislet itself seems lately to have been two: the neck and head are\r\none, and the body is another; an evident sea-cliff marks the\r\njunction, and what appears like a Wady below it, is the upraised\r\nsea-bed of coralline. To the north-west, and outside this strip,\r\nlies the little port defended by a network of reefs, in which our\r\nSambúk had first taken refuge. The bay-shore bears traces of more\r\nthan one wreck; and in the graveyard used by the native sailor,\r\nan open awning of flotsam and jetsam looks from afar like a\r\ntumble-down log-hut. The number of reefs and shoals shown by\r\nstripes of vivid green water promised excellent fishing, and\r\nfailed to keep its promise.\r\n\r\nAt length, after a third wasted day, we managed, despite a new\r\nhole in the old boiler, to steam out of hospitable Sináfir at\r\n6:30 a.m. on the auspicious Wednesday, February 13. The\r\nappearance of the Mukhbir must have been originale enough: her\r\ncanvas had been fished out of the hold, but in the place of a\r\nmainsail she had hoisted a topsail. We passed as close as\r\npossible to the islet-line of Secondary formation, beginning with\r\nShu'shu', the wedge bluff-faced to south: the Palinurus anchored\r\nhere in a small bight on the north-east side, between two reefs,\r\nand narrowly escaped being wrecked by a northerly gale. At 10:45\r\na.m. we were alongside of Baráhkán, a double feature, lumpy and\r\ncliffy, connected by a low sandy isthmus: the eastern flank gives\r\ngood shelter to native crafts. Lastly came Yubá', the compound\r\nquoin, the loftiest of the group, upwards of 350 feet high, with\r\nits low-lying neighbour Wálih. These islets have classical names,\r\nas I have before mentioned,[EN#141] and appear once to have been\r\ninhabited: even at Yubú', the least likely of all, we heard from\r\nseveral authorities of a deep rock-cut well, covered with a stone\r\nwhich the Arabs could not raise.\r\n\r\nAnd now we were able to cast an intelligent glance in review of\r\nthe scenes made familiar by our first or northern march. The\r\nsurpassing purity of the transparent atmosphere, especially at\r\nthis season, causes the land to look as near at twenty as at ten\r\nmiles; and thus both distances, showing the horizon with the\r\nutmost distinctness, appear equally close to the ship. Beginning\r\ntowards El-Akabah, the Jebel el-Zánah behind Magháir Shu'ayb,\r\nand its mighty neighbour, the Jebel el-Lauz, form the horizon of\r\nmountains which are not the least amongst the giants. Southwards\r\nappear the Jibál el-Tihámah, the noble forms of the seaboard, the\r\nparallel chains noting the eastern boundary of Madyan (Proper);\r\nwhile behind them the Jibál el-Shafah, reduced to blue heads and\r\nfragments of purple wall, are evidently disposed on a far more\r\ndistant plane.\r\n\r\nAs regards the Jibál el-Tihámah, I have registered ad nauseam the\r\nnames of the eight several blocks into which, between El-Zahd\r\nnorth and El-Shárr south, the curtain, rising from a sea-horizon,\r\nseems to divide itself. Every one consulted gave me a new or a\r\ndifferent term; and apparently seamen and landsmen have their\r\nseparate nomenclature. Thus, the pilots call the Fás, Harb and\r\nDibbagh blocks, Jibál el-Musaybah, Tiryam, and Dámah, after the\r\nWadys and main valleys that drain them. The Bedawin, again, will\r\nname the whole block after the part most interesting to them:\r\nthus the tower-like formation characterizing Jebel Dibbagh was\r\noften called \"Jebel el-Jimm,\" and even this, as will afterwards\r\nappear, was not quite exact.[EN#142]\r\n\r\nWe fired a gun off El-Muwaylah, where our camp, ranged in long\r\nline, looked clean and natty. At five p.m. we were once more at\r\nhome in our old quarters, the Sharm Yáhárr: the day's work had\r\nnumbered fifty direct geographical miles between Sina'fir and\r\nEl-Muwaylah, with five more to our dock.\r\n\r\n                             Résumé\r\n\r\nOur journey through Madyan Proper (North Midian) had lasted\r\nfifty-four days (December 19, 1877, to February 13, 1878). During\r\nnearly two months the Expedition had covered only 105 to 107\r\nmiles of ground: this, however, does not include the various\r\nby-trips made by the members, which would more than double the\r\ntotal; nor the cruise of two hundred miles round the Gulf of\r\nAkabah, ending at El-Muwaylah. The total of camels employed\r\nvaried from 106 to 61, and their hire, including \"bakhshísh\" and\r\nall minor charges, amounted, according to Mr. Clarke, to £316\r\n14s. 3d.\r\n\r\nThis section of North Midian may be described as essentially a\r\nmining country, which, strange to say of a province so near\r\nEgypt, has been little worked by the Ancients. The first\r\nKhedivial Expedition brought back specimens of free gold found in\r\nbasalt, apparently eruptive, and in corundophyllite, which the\r\nengineer called greenstone porphyry: silver appeared in the red\r\nsands, in the chloritic quartz, and in the titaniferous iron of\r\nthe Jebel el-Abayz; the value being 265 to 300 francs per ton,\r\nwith traces in the scoriæ. The second Expedition failed to find\r\ngold, but brought back argentiferous galena in copper-stained\r\nquartz, and possibly in the ochraceous red veins seaming the\r\nSecondary gypsum; with silicates and carbonates of copper: select\r\nspecimens of the latter yielding the enormous proportion of forty\r\nper cent. In this northern region the great focus of metallic\r\ndeposit appears to lie between north lat. 28° 40' and 27° 50';\r\nthat is, from the Jebel Tayyib Ism, north of Makná, to the\r\nsouthern basin which contains the Jebel el-Abyaz or \"White\r\nMountain.\" Its characteristics are the argentiferous and\r\ncupriferous ores, whereas in South Midian gold and silver were\r\nworked; and the parallelogram whose limits are assigned above,\r\nmight be converted into a Northern Grant. Concerning the immense\r\nabundance of gypsum, and the sulphur which is suspected to be\r\ndiffused throughout the Secondary formation, ample details have\r\nbeen given in the preceding pages.\r\n\r\nThe principal ruins of ancient settlements, and the ateliers, all\r\nof them showing vestiges of metal-working, numbered eight: these\r\nare, beginning from the south, Tiryam, Sharmá, Aynúnah, the\r\nJebel el-Abyaz, Magháir Shu'ayb, Makná', Tayyib Ism, and\r\nEl-Akabah. Magháir Shu'ayb, the Madiáma of Ptolemy, is evidently\r\nthe ancient capital of the district. It was the only place which\r\nsupplied Midianitish (Nabathæan) coins. Moreover, it yielded\r\ngraffiti from the catacombs; fragments of bronze which it will be\r\ninteresting to compare by assay with the metal of the European\r\nprehistoric age; and, finally, stone implements, worked as well\r\nas rude.\r\n\r\nI will end with a few words concerning the future industry of\r\nNorth Midian.\r\n\r\nFor the success of these mines the greatest economy will be\r\nnecessary. The poorest ore can be treated on the spot by crushing\r\nand washing, where no expenditure of fuel is required. The richer\r\nstone, that wants roasting and smelting, would be shipped, when\r\nworth the while, from North Midian to Suez: there coal is\r\nabundant, and the deserted premises of Dussaud-Bey, belonging to\r\nthe Egyptian Government, would form an excellent site for a great\r\nusine centrale. Finally, the richest specimens--especially those\r\ncontaining, as many do, a medley of metals--would be treated with\r\nthe least expenditure, and the greatest advantage, at Swansea or\r\nin other parts of England, where there are large establishments\r\nwhich make such work their specialty.\r\n\r\nThe following analyses of the specimens brought home by the first\r\nKhedivial Expedition, were made at the Citadel, Cairo, by the\r\nwell-known chemist, Gastinel-Bey, in conjunction with M. George\r\nMarie, the engineer attached to the Expedition:--\r\n\r\nAnalyses (Mm. Gastinel-bey and George Marie of Cairo) of Rocks\r\n     Brought Home by the First Khedivial Expedition.\r\n\r\n(All by Voie Sèche.)\r\n\r\nGold (assay on 100 grammes)--\r\n\r\n     1. In basalt (lava?).\r\n\r\n     2. In serpentine.\r\n     (None in white quartz.)\r\n\r\nSilver--\r\n\r\n     1. In Filon Husayn, 1/1000 = 265 to 300 francs per ton (very\r\ngood).\r\n\r\n     2. In red sands, 1/10,000 (= 20 francs per ton).\r\n\r\n     3. In scoriæ, traces.\r\n     (None in white quartz or in the black sands.)\r\n\r\nCopper--\r\n\r\n     1. In Aynúnah quartz, 4 1/2 per 100.\r\n\r\n     2. In Filon Husayn, 2 1/2 to 3.40 per cent.\r\n           Filon Husayn = Titaniferous iron, 86.50\r\n                       Silica, 10.10\r\n                       Copper, 3.40.\r\n\r\n     3. In chloritic slate, 1.40 per cent.\r\n          (Chloritic slate of Makná' =\r\n               Silica, 90.50\r\n               Carbonate of lime, 5.60\r\n               Oxide of iron, 2.30\r\n               Copper, 1.40.)\r\n\r\nSulphur (Jebel el-Kibri't of El-Muwaylah)--\r\n     4 per cent. above. 9 ditto below.\r\n\r\nLead everywhere.\r\n\r\nCalamine (zinc) very rich.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Part II.\r\n\r\n         The March Through Central and Eastern Midian.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Chapter IX.\r\n\r\n                Work in and Around El-Muwaylah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe arrived at El-Muwaylah too late to meet the Hajj-caravan,\r\nwhich, home returning, had passed hurriedly through the station\r\non February 9th. This institution has sadly fallen off from its\r\nhigh estate of a quarter of a century ago. Then commanded by an\r\nAmir el-Hajj--\"Lord of the Pilgrimage\"--in the shape of two\r\nPashas (generals), it is now under the direction of a single Bey\r\n(colonel). The \"True Believers,\" once numbering thousands, were\r\nreduced in 1877-78 to some eight hundred souls, of whom only\r\neighty appeared at El-Muwaylah; and the peculiar modification of\r\nmodern days is that the Mahmal is escorted only by paupers. Yet\r\nthe actual number of the Hájis who stand upon Jebel Arafát,\r\ninstead of diminishing, has greatly increased. The majority\r\nprefer voyaging to travelling; the rich hire state-cabins on\r\nboard well-appointed \"Infidel\" steamers, and the poor content\r\nthemselves with \"Faithful\" Sambúks. Indeed, it would seem that\r\nall the present measures, quarantines of sixty days (!) and\r\ndetention at wretched Tor, comfortless enough to make the\r\nhealthiest lose health, are intended to discourage and deter\r\n\"palmers\" from proceeding by land. If this course be continued, a\r\nvery few years will see the venerable institution represented by\r\nonly the Mahmal and its guard. The late Sa'id Pasha of Egypt once\r\nconsigned the memorial litter per steam-frigate to Jeddah: the\r\ninnovation saved Ghafr (\"blackmail\") to the Bedawin; but it was\r\nnot approved of by the Moslem world.\r\n\r\nThe Hájis were so poor that they had nothing for barter or for\r\nsale. Happily, however, there was a farrier amongst them, and\r\nLieutenant Yusuf took care that our mules were properly shod. M.\r\nPhilipin had been a maréchal ferrant, but a kick or two had left\r\nhim no stomach for the craft. Our two fellow-travellers, with the\r\nwhole camp, had set out from Makná on February 6th, and marched\r\nup the great Wady el-Kharaj. Along the eastern flank of the Jebel\r\nel-Fahísát, the \"Iron Mountain,\" they found many outcrops of\r\nquartz, a rock which appears sporadically all the way to the\r\nnorthern soufrière. In two places it was green-stained, showing\r\ncopper, while in another hydrated oxide and chromate of iron\r\n(hematite)[EN#143] abounded. After a stage of four hours and\r\ntwenty minutes they left the caravan, struck off to the west,\r\naccompanied by Shaykh Furayj, and reached their destination.\r\nHere, however, they met with accidents: the mules bolted,\r\nfollowed by the Shaykh's dromedary, and they were obliged to\r\nhurry off for fear of losing the caravan, now well ahead of them.\r\nThus, when I had ordered Lieutenant Yusuf to make a detailed plan\r\nof the formation, he had spent exactly ten minutes on the spot,\r\nand he appeared not a little proud of his work.\r\n\r\nThis young officer was not a pleasant companion. He had doubtless\r\nreceived his orders, but he carried them out in a peculiarly\r\ndisagreeable way, taking notes of all our proceedings under our\r\neyes. Together with Lieutenant Amir, he began to make a\r\ncollection of geology: both, being utterly innocent of all\r\nknowledge, imitated us in picking up specimens; mixed them\r\ntogether without notes or labels; and, on return to Cairo, duly\r\npresented them at the Citadel. This was all that was required.\r\nThe papers were \"written to\" and reported as follows: \"Closer\r\nexamination has shown that the turquoises' brought to Cairo are\r\nmerely malachite (!); and that the existence of any such quantity\r\nof gold as would pay for the working is, to say the least of it,\r\nvery doubtful.\"[EN#144]\r\n\r\nThe whole camp, indeed, was seized with a mania for collecting:\r\nold Háji Wali again gathered bits of quartz, which he once more\r\npresented as gold-stone to his friends and acquaintances at\r\nZagázig; and Anton, the dragoman, triumphantly bore away\r\nfragments bristling with mica-slate, whose glitter he fondly\r\nconceived to be silver.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Yusuf was presently despatched with three soldiers,\r\nthree quarrymen, Jází, the Arab guide of a former visit, and\r\neight camels, to bring back specimens of the copper silicate to\r\nthe south of Aynánah, and to make a regular survey of the\r\nnorthern solfatara. He set out early on February 18th, and after\r\ntwenty-one hours of caravan-marching reached the Jebel el-Fara'.\r\nHere the outcrop is bounded north by the Wady el-Fara', and south\r\nby the Wadys el-Maríkhah and Umm Nírán, the latter forming the\r\ngeneral recipient of these Nullahs. The Jebel is about 120 feet\r\nhigh, of oval form, stretching 1750 metres from north-north-west\r\nto south-south-east. The rich silicate (not carbonate) of copper,\r\nwhich disdains a streak and affects the file, is found, as usual\r\nwith this ore, only in one part of the valley to the south-west,\r\nsome thirty-five feet above the sole: it is a pocket, a\r\n\"circumscribed deposit,\" as opposed to a \"true vein\" or a\r\n\"vein-fissure.\" The adjoining rocks contain carbonates of iron\r\nand copper, and the ore-mass is apparently carbonate of lime.\r\nThis second visit generally confirmed the report of Ahmed Kaptán,\r\nexcept that there were no signs of working, as he had supposed.\r\nThe travellers passed the whole of February 20th at the diggings,\r\nmade a plan, and sent back two camel-loads (four sacks) of the\r\ngangue, in charge of a soldier, to the Fort of El-Muwaylah.\r\n\r\nOn the next day the little party made for the Wady Aynúnah, and,\r\nstriking to the left of the straight line, crossed the maritime\r\ncountry, here a mass of Wadys, including our old friend the\r\nAfál. This highway to the northern Hismá falls, I have said,\r\ninto the Mínat el-Ayánát, a portlet useful to Sambúks: its\r\nsickle-shaped natural breakwater, curving from west to south,\r\nresembles that of Sinaitic Marsá el-Ginái, and those which are so\r\ncommon in Western Iceland. On February 22nd, a very devious path,\r\nnarrow and rocky, lasting for one hour, led them, about noon, to\r\nthe northern Jebel el-Kibrít. The distance from El-Muwaylah is\r\nabout sixty-six miles; and the country west of a line drawn from\r\nAynúnah to Makná was, before this march, utterly unknown to us,\r\nconsequently to all the civilized world.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Yusuf's two journals checking each other, his plan and\r\nhis specimens enable me to describe the northern deposit with\r\nmore or less accuracy. The Sulphur-hill is a long oval of four\r\nhundred metres (east-west), by a maximum of one hundred and\r\neighty (north-south); but it extends branches in all directions:\r\nthe mineral was also found in a rounded piton, a knob on the Wady\r\nMusayr, attached to the north-eastern side. The flattened dome is\r\nfrom fifty to sixty feet high, and the piton one hundred and\r\nforty. The metal underlying a dark crust, some twelve to fifteen\r\ncentimetres thick, appears in regular crystals and amorphous\r\nfragments of pure brimstone pitting the chalky sulphate of lime:\r\nblasting was not required; the soft material yielded readily to\r\nthe pick. This gypseous or Secondary formation was found to\r\nextend, not only over the adjacent hills, but everywhere along\r\nthe road to Makná. The important point which now remains to be\r\ndetermined is, I repeat, whether sulphur-veins can be found\r\ndiffused throughout these non-plutonic rocks.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Yusuf fixed his position by climbing the adjacent\r\nhills, whence Sina'fir bore 190°, and Shu'shu' 150° (both\r\nmagnetic); while greater elevations to the west shut out the view\r\nof lofty Ti'ra'n, and even of the Sinaitic range. The nearest\r\nwater in the Wady el-Nakhil to the north-east was reported to be\r\na two hours' march with loaded camels (= five miles) Several\r\nlittle ports, quite unknown to the Hydrographic Chart, were\r\nvisited. These are, beginning from the north, the Mínat Hamdán,\r\nlying between Makná and Dabbah; a refuge for Sambúks defended,\r\nlike that of old \"Madyan,\" by rising ground to the north. About\r\nthree miles and a quarter further south is the Sharm Dabbah, the\r\n\"Sherm Dhaba, good anchorage\" of the Chart: this mass of reefs\r\nand shoals may have been one of the \"excellent harbours\"\r\nmentioned by Procopius. It receives the Wady Sha'b el-Gánn\r\n(Jánn), \"the Watercourse of the Demons' (Ja'nn) Ravine,\" flowing\r\nfrom a haunted hill of red stone, near which no Arab dares to\r\nsleep. From that point the travellers struck nine miles and a\r\nhalf to south-east of Ghubbat Suwayhil: this roadstead, used only\r\nby native craft, lies eastward of the long point forming the\r\nArabian staple of the Gulf el-Akabah's gate, where the\r\ncoast-line of Midian bends at a right angle towards the rising\r\nsun. Adjoining it to the east, and separated by a long thin spit,\r\nis the Ghubbat el-Wagab (Wajb), the mouth of the watercourse\r\nsimilarly named: it is also known to the Katírah or \"smaller\r\nvessel,\" and about a mile up its bed, which comes from the\r\nnorth-east, there is a well. According to Jázi, the guide, this\r\nGhubbah (\"gulf\"), distant only four to five hours of slow\r\nmarching from the Sulphur-hill, will be the properest place for\r\nshipping produce. In another eastern feature, the Wady Giyál\r\n(Jiyál), distant some eleven miles and a half from Aynúnah and\r\nending in a kind of sink, there is a fine growth of palms, about\r\na quarter of a mile long, and a supply of \"wild\" (brackish) water\r\nin wells and rain-pools. These uninteresting details will become\r\nvaluable when the sulphur-mines of North Midian are ripe for\r\nworking.\r\n\r\nFrom the Ghubbat el-Wagab, the path, easy travelling over flat\r\nground, strikes to the north-east; and, fourteen miles and a half\r\nbeyond, joins the Aynúnah highway. On February 26th, at the end\r\nof nine days' work, Lieutenant Yusuf returned to El-Muwaylah with\r\ntwo sacks of sulphur-bearing chalk which justified his previous\r\nreport. As will appear, the Expedition was still travelling\r\nthrough the interior: after a halt for rest at head-quarters, he\r\nrejoined us on our northward route from Zibá, and I again found\r\nuseful occupation for his energies.\r\n\r\nUpon our happy return \"home,\" i.e. Sharm Yáhárr, preparations for\r\na march upon the Hismá were at once begun. My heart was firmly\r\nfixed upon this project, hoping to find an \"unworked California\"\r\nto the east of the Harrah volcanoes; but the Shaykhs and\r\ncamel-men, who did not like the prospect of a rough reception by\r\nthe Ma'ázah bandits, threw sundry small stumbling-blocks in our\r\npath. It was evidently useless to notice them so far from the\r\nspot; they would develop themselves only too well as we\r\napproached the tribal frontier. While these obstacles were being\r\ncleared away, we carefully examined the little dock that had so\r\noften given us shelter in the hour of need; and I set a small\r\nparty to work at the central Jebel el-Kibri't, which had been\r\nexplored by the first Expedition.\r\n\r\nSharm Yáhárr is the usual distorted T, a long channel heading in\r\na shorter cross-piece: it is formed by the confluence of four\r\nvalleys, all composed of corallines and conglomerates of new\r\nsandstone. Those to the north and the north-west show distinct\r\nsigns of upheaval; the two eastern features, known as the Wady\r\nel-Hárr (\"the Hot Watercourse\"), of which Yáhárr appears to be a\r\ncorruption, bear marks of man's hand. The dock is divided into an\r\nouter and inner \"port\" by a projecting northern point which is\r\nnot sufficiently marked in the Chart (enlarged plan). At this\r\nplace, where the tide rises a full metre, the crew of the Mukhbir\r\nhad built a jetty of rough boulders, by way of passe-temps and to\r\nprevent wading. Native craft lie inside, opposite the ruins of a\r\nstone house: the existence of a former population is shown by the\r\nmany graves on the upper plateau. In the northern Wady el-Hárr,\r\nalso, we picked up specimens of obsidian, oligistic iron, and\r\nadmirably treated modern (?) slags showing copper and iron;\r\nevidently some Gypsy-like atelier must once have worked upon the\r\nWady Yáhárr. The obsidian also has apparently been subjected to\r\nthe artificial fire; and a splinter of it contains a paillette of\r\nfree copper.\r\n\r\nWhat concerned us most, however, was the discovery of oysters,\r\nwhich, adhering to the reefs projected under water from the rocky\r\nnorthern cliff, formed a live conglomerate; and from the present\r\ntime forwards we found the succulent molluscs in almost every\r\nbay. Those to the south, where the shallows overlie sand and mud,\r\nare not so good. At this season the Ustrída is flat, fleshy, and\r\nfull sized; the shell has a purple border, and the hinge muscle\r\nof the savage, far stronger than that of the civilized animal,\r\ntogether with its exceeding irregularity of shape, giving no\r\npurchase to the knife, makes oyster-opening a sore trouble. We\r\ntried fire, but the thick-skinned things resisted it for a long\r\ntime; and, when they did gape, the liquor had disappeared,\r\nthereby spoiling the flavour. The \"beard\" was neither black, like\r\nthat of the Irish, nor colourless, as in the English oyster. The\r\nBedawin, who ignore the delicacy, could not answer any questions\r\nabout the \"spatting season\"--probably it is earlier than ours,\r\nwhich extends through June; whether also a close time is\r\nrequired, as in England to August 4th, we could not guess. The\r\nyoung probably find a natural \"culch\" in the many shells, cockle\r\nand others, that strew the rock, sand, and clay.\r\n\r\nKnowing that my gallant friend, Admiral McKillop (Pasha) of\r\nAlexandria, takes great interest in \"ostreoculture,\" I sent him\r\nfrom Suez a barrel of the best Midianites The water had escaped\r\nby the carelessness of the magazine-man: enough, however,\r\nremained alive to be thrown into the harbour Eunostos, where they\r\nwill, I hope, become the parents of a fine large progeny of\r\n\"natives.\" Similarly we had laid in a store of forty-two\r\nlangoustes (crayfish) for presentation at Court, and to gladden\r\nthe hearts of Cairéne friends: our Greeks placed the tubs in the\r\nsun and so close to the funnel, that, after about three hours,\r\nall the fine collection perished ignobly.\r\n\r\nWe will now proceed to the central Jebel el-Kibri't; a\r\nsuperficial examination of which by the first Expedition[EN#145]\r\nproved that the upper rock yielded four, and the lower nine, per\r\ncent. of tolerably pure brimstone. The shortest cut from the\r\ndock-harbour lies up the southern Wady Ha'rr, with its strangely\r\nweathered sandstone rocks, soft modern grits that look\r\nworm-eaten. Amongst them is a ledge-like block with undermined\r\nbase projecting from the left bank: both the upper and the lower\r\nparts are scattered over with Wasm, or Arab tribal marks. On our\r\nreturn from El-Wijh we found this sandstone tongue broken in two:\r\nthe massive root remained in situ, but the terminal half had\r\nfallen on the ground. This was probably the work of an earthquake\r\nwhich we felt at Sharm Dumayghah on March 22nd.[EN#146] The track\r\nthen strikes the modern Hajj-road, which runs west of and close\r\nto the Sulphur-hill; the line is a succession of\r\nwatercourses,[EN#147] and in Wady Khirgah we found blocks of the\r\nhydrous silicate, corundophyllite which may be Serpentine: it is\r\ncomposed of a multitude of elements, especially pyrites. After an\r\nhour and a quarter's sharp walking, we hit the broad Wady\r\nel-Kibrít, which rounds its Jebel to the south-east, and which\r\nfeeds the Wady el-Jibbah, itself a feeder of the Sharm Jibbah.\r\nThe latter, which gave us shelter in the corvette Sinnár (Captain\r\nAli Bey), is a long blue line of water bounding the western base\r\nof the Sulphur-hill.\r\n\r\nThis central Tuwayyil el-Kibrít is an isolated knob, rising\r\nabruptly from Wady-ground; measuring some 240 feet in height, and\r\nabout 880 metres in diameter, not including its tail of four\r\nvertebræ which sets off from north-west to south-east. Viewed\r\nfrom the north it is, as the Egyptian officers remarked, a\r\nregular Haram (\"pyramid\"), with a kidney-formed capping of\r\nprecipitous rock. Drinkable water, like that of the Wady el-Ghál,\r\nis said to be found in the Wady el-Kibrít to the north-east; and\r\nthe country is everywhere tolerably wooded. The Bedawin brought\r\nus small specimens of rock-crystal and fragments of Negro-quartz,\r\napparently rich in metal, from a neighbouring \"Maru.\" They placed\r\nit amongst the hill-masses to the east and south; and we\r\nafterwards found it for ourselves.[EN#148]\r\n\r\nOur middle Sulphur-hill differs essentially from the other two\r\ndeposits, the northern near Makná, and the southern near El-Wijh,\r\nin being plutonic and not sedimentary. One would almost say that\r\nit smokes, and the heat-altered condition of the granite, the\r\ngreenstone, and other rocks, looking as if fresh from a fire,\r\nsuggests that it may be one of the igneous veins, thrown westward\r\nby the great volcanic region, El-Harrah. In parts it is a\r\nconglomerate, where a quantity of quartz takes the place of chalk\r\nand gypsum. Other deposits are iron-stained and have the\r\nappearance of the decomposed iron pyrites which abounds in this\r\nneighbourhood. Usually the yield is the normal brimstone-yellow,\r\nyet some of the beds are deep red, as if coloured by ochre or\r\noxide of iron: this variety is very common in the solfataras of\r\nIceland; and I have heard of it in the Jebel Mokattam, near\r\nCairo. The colour is probably due to molecular changes, and\r\npossibly shows greater age than the yellow.\r\n\r\nM. Philipin was directed to take charge of Sergeant Mabrúk, the\r\nnine quarrymen, and the Bedawi owners of two camels to carry his\r\nboring-irons, forge, and water from El-Muwaylah. I advised him to\r\ndig at least forty feet down all round the pyramid, wherever\r\nsurface-indications attracted notice: old experience had taught\r\nme that such depth is necessary before one can expect to find\r\nbrimstone beds like those of Sicily. The borings brought up\r\nsulphur from fourteen metres; beyond these, six were pierced, but\r\nthey yielded nothing. In and around the pyramid M. Philipin sank\r\nfive pits; the northernmost shaft, half-way up the hill, gave\r\ncrystals of the purest sulphur.\r\n\r\nIf the depth of the deposit be not great, the surface extent is.\r\nThe pyramid evidently forms the apex of a large vein which\r\nstrikes north-south. The field consists of this cone with its\r\ndependencies, especially the yellow cliffs to the north and the\r\nsouth, facing, in the latter direction, a large plain cut by the\r\nWady el-Kibrít. Moreover, a vein of the red variety, about three\r\nkilometres long by twenty-five to thirty metres broad, lies to\r\nthe south-east near a gypsum hill: the latter also yields the\r\ncrystallized salt which so often accompanies sulphur, and heaps\r\nof gigantic half-fossilized oyster-shells are strewed about it.\r\n\r\nM. Philipin here remained sixteen days (February 18--March 5),\r\nduring our absence in the East Country; on return we found our\r\ngood blacksmith much changed for the worse. Whilst in hard work\r\nhe had been half-starved, the Jeráfín Bedawin of the\r\nneighbourhood having disappeared with their flocks; he had been\r\nterribly worried by the cameleers, and he had been at perpetual\r\nfeud with the miserable quarrymen. I never saw a man less fitted\r\nto deal with (two-legged) \"natives.\" The latter instinctively\r\ndivined that he would rather work himself than force others to\r\nwork; and they acted accordingly.\r\n\r\nThe Expedition was thus divided into four, three working parties\r\nand one of idlers. Anton and Petros were left behind to do\r\nnothing as magazine-men.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Darwaysh (the linesman) who was too weak to ride, and\r\nSub-Lieutenant Mohammed (the miner) who was too old to travel,\r\nhad charge of the sick; both found the far niente equally sweet.\r\nOn February 17th I again bade adieu to the gunboat Mukhbir, and\r\nmarched with the largest party upon our camp at El-Muwaylah,\r\ndistant about six miles (=one hour and forty-five minutes). The\r\npath from Sharm Yáhárr crosses the hard sands of the maritime\r\nplain, metalled with the natural macadam of the Desert. The stone\r\nis mostly dark silex, the \"hen's liver\" of the Brazil, and its\r\nsurface is kept finely polished, and free from \"patina,\" by the\r\nfriction of the dust-laden winds. The line is deeply gashed by\r\nshort, broad gullies: the Hajj-road, running further east, heads\r\nthese ugly Nullahs. The third and largest channel is Wady Surr,\r\nthe great valley of El-Muwaylah, which may be regarded as the\r\nsouthern frontier of \"Madyan\" (Proper): we shall trace it to its\r\nhead in the Hismá.\r\n\r\nI had left the camp-pitching at El-Muwaylah to the Egyptian\r\nofficers, who naturally chose the site nearest the two northern\r\nwells; a wave of ground hot by day, cold at night, windy and\r\ndusty at all times; moreover, the water was near enough to be\r\nhorribly fouled. No wonder that in such a place many of the men\r\nfell ill, and that one subsequently died--our only loss during\r\nthe four months' march.\r\n\r\nOn February 18th we proceeded, under the misguidance of a\r\nBásh-Buzúk of the fort, Ahmed Sálih el-Mal'ún, to inspect a\r\nneighbouring ruin called Abá Hawáwít--\"the Father of (Dwelling-)\r\nWalls.\" Wallin (p. 30) declares that, \"finding no mention made of\r\nMuweilih in Arab manuscripts, nor traces or traditions among the\r\nexisting generation in the land, pointing to a high antiquity,\"\r\nhe is inclined to consider it a town of modern origin, in fact\r\nthe growth of the Egyptian pilgrimage. His error is excusable. He\r\nwas a passing traveller; and I well remember that for a whole\r\nyear the true name of a hill immediately behind our house at\r\nDamascus remained unknown to me: we had called it after our own\r\nfashion, and the term had at once been adopted by all our\r\nover-polite native friends. Indeed, this is one of the serious\r\ndifficulties to be encountered, throughout the East, by the\r\nscrupulous traveller whose greatest fear is that of misleading\r\nothers. The Expedition had paid four several visits to\r\nEl-Muwaylah, and had never heard a word about ruins, when I\r\nhappened to read out before the Shaykhs assembled at Magháir\r\nShu'ayb a passage from El-Makrízi treating of the destroyed\r\ncities of Madyan. They at once mentioned half a dozen names lying\r\nwithin short distances of the \"little salt.\" Amongst them was Abú\r\nHawáwít, literally meaning \"tenement walls,\" but here applied, in\r\nthe short form Hawáwít, to ruins in general.\r\n\r\nHad \"Wali Háji,\" as Wallin was called by the Bedawin, looked only\r\nten feet beyond the north-eastern tower of the fort, near the ruins\r\nof a modern Mastabah (\"masonry bench\"), he would have found long-\r\nforgotten vestiges of ovens and slags containing copper and iron.\r\nThe same will prove to be the case about the inland defence of El-\r\nWijh; in fact, all these works seem for obvious reasons to have been\r\nbuilt upon sites that have been utilized long before their modern\r\nday. El-Muwaylah was probably a more important place than it is at\r\npresent, when the reef-harbour, which now admits native craft only\r\nby a gap to the south-west, had not been choked by shoals. The sandy\r\nsoil wants only water to produce a luxuriant perennial growth, and\r\nevery garden can have its well. But more life is wanting; a man\r\nheaps up a thorn-hedge, or builds a swish-wall of the brick-clay\r\nunderlying the Wady, and he forgets only to lay out the field\r\nwithin. Local history does not, it is true, extend beyond two\r\nhundred years or so, the probable date of Shaykh Abdullah's\r\nvenerated sepulchre, a truncated parallelogram of cut coralline on\r\nthe Wady Sughayyir to the north of the settlement. Yet this \"little\r\nsalt\" is too remarkable a site to have remained unoccupied. Possibly\r\nit is the \"<Greek>,\" the Horse Village (and fort ?), which Ptolemy\r\n(vi. II) places in north lat. 26° 40' (true 27° 40'), whilst his\r\n\"<Greek>\" would be the glorious Shárr, correctly consigned to north\r\nlat. 27° 20'. This argues an error of nearly sixty miles by the\r\ngeographer or his copyists. But Chapter XII. will attempt to show\r\nthat the latitude of <Greek>, the modern Shuwák, is also one degree\r\ntoo low. So on the East African coast Ptolemy places his Aromata\r\nPromontorium, which can only be \"Guardafui,\" between north lat. 5°\r\nand 7°, whereas it lies in north lat. 11° 41' 4\".\r\n\r\nThe Awwal Hawáwít, or first ruins, begin on the right bank of the\r\nSurr after one mile and three quarters from camp; and bear\r\nnorth-east (55° mag.) from the minaret of El-Muwaylah Fort. The\r\nposition is a sandy basin, containing old Bedawi graves, bounded\r\nby a low ridge forming a boulder-clad buttress to the Wady, while\r\nthe circuit of the two may be a mile and a half. A crumbling\r\nmodern tower, crowning the right bank, and two Mahrákah\r\n(\"rub-stones\") were the principal remains. The situation must\r\nhave been well chosen in the days when the heights were wooded,\r\nand the Wady was a river. We afterwards mapped the body of the\r\nplace, lying about three miles from the fort, showing the Yubú'\r\nbank to north-west (298° mag.); and nearly due west (260° mag.)\r\nEl-Muwaylah's only house, the Sayyid's. The site is a holm or\r\nisland in the Wady Surr, which here runs east-west, and splits:\r\nthe main line is the southern, and a small branch, a mere gully,\r\noccupies the northern bed-side.\r\n\r\nThe chief ruin is an oblong of twenty metres by sixteen, the\r\nshort ends facing 195° (mag.); the whole built of huge pebbles.\r\nThe interior is composed of one large room to the north, with\r\nsundry smaller divisions to the south, east, and west. Defence\r\nwas secured by a wall, distant 142 metres, thrown across the\r\nwhole eastern part of the islet: outside it are three large pits,\r\nevidently the site of cisterns. The people also told us of a\r\nwell, the Bir el-Ashgham, which has long been mysteriously\r\nhidden. Immense labour has also been expended in revetting the\r\nnorthern and southern banks, both of the islet and the smaller\r\nbranch-bed, for many hundreds of yards with round and\r\nwater-rolled boulders, even on a larger scale than at Magháir\r\nShu'ayb. What all this work meant we were unable to divine.\r\nPerhaps it belonged to the days when the seaboard of Midian was\r\nagricultural; and it was intended as a protection against the two\r\ntorrents, the Wadys el-Zila' and Abú Zabah, which here fall into\r\nthe northern bank.\r\n\r\nThe 18th of February also made itself memorable to the second\r\nExpedition. M. Marie was strolling near the old furnaces to the\r\nnorth-east of the fort where, in 1877, he had picked up an\r\nauriferous specimen, unfortunately lost before it reached Cairo.\r\nHere he again found a fragment of serpentine, broken and\r\nwater-rolled into the semblance of half a globe; it showed crust\r\nand stains of iron, filets of white quartz, and a curve (~) of\r\nbright yellow dots, disposed like the chainlet of an aneroid.\r\nThereupon, we gravely debated whether these were the remains of a\r\nvein, or had been brought to the surface by the rubbing and\r\npolishing of the stone in water.\r\n\r\nI could not but remark that the interior, which appeared\r\npyritiferous, did not show the slightest trace of precious metal.\r\nStill the discovery gave fresh courage to all our people. The\r\ntrophy was shown to every Bedawi, far and near, with the promise\r\nof a large reward (fifty dollars) to the lucky wight who could\r\nlead us to the rock in situ. The general voice declared that the\r\n\"gold-stone\" was the produce of Jebel Malayh (Malíh): we\r\nafterwards ascertained by marching up the Wady Surr that it was\r\nnot. In fact, the whole neighbourhood was thoroughly well\r\nscoured; but the results were nil. In due course of time the\r\ntarnishing and the disappearance of the metal reduced my\r\nscepticism to a certainty: the \"gold dots\" were the trace of some\r\npilgrim or soldier's copper-nailed boot. It was the first time\r\nthat this ludicrous mistake arose, but not the last--our native\r\nfriends were ever falling into the same trap.\r\n\r\nAmongst the minor industries of the Fort el-Muwaylah must be\r\nreckoned selling gazelles. The Bedawin bring them in, and so\r\nsucceed in taming the timid things that they will follow their\r\nowner like dogs, and amuse themselves with hopping upon his\r\nshoulders. When thus trained, \"Ariel\" is supposed to be worth\r\nhalf a napoleon. The wild ones may be bought at almost every\r\nfort, as Zibá or El-Wijh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Chapter X.\r\n\r\n               Through East Midian to the Hismá.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Land of Midian is by no means one of the late Prince\r\nMetternich's \"geographical expressions.\" The present tenants of\r\nthe soil give a precise and practical definition of its limits.\r\nTheir Arz Madyan extends from El-Akabah north (north lat. 29°\r\n28') to El-Muwaylah with its Wady, El-Surr (north lat. 27° 40').\r\nIt has thus a total latitudinal length of 108 direct geographical\r\nmiles.[EN#149] South of this line, the seaboard of North-Western\r\nArabia, as far as El-Hejaz, has no generic name. The Bedawin are\r\ncontented with such vague terms, derived from some striking\r\nfeature, as \"the Lands of Zibá,\" \"of Wady Salmá,\" \"of Wady\r\nDámah,\" \"of El-Wijh,\" to denote the tract lying between the\r\nparallels of El-Muwaylah and of Wady Hamz (<Arabic>) in north\r\nlat. 25° 55' 15. Thus the north-south length of the southern\r\nmoiety would be 105 direct geographical miles, or a little less\r\nthan the northern; and the grand total would be 213 miles.\r\n\r\nThe breadth of this Egyptian province is determined by the\r\ndistance from the sea to the maritime mountains. In Madyan\r\nProper, or North Midian, the extremes would be twenty-four and\r\nthirty-five miles. For the southern half these figures may be\r\ndoubled. Here, again, the Bedawin are definitive as regards\r\nlimits. All the Tihámah or \"lowlands\" and their ranges belong to\r\nEgypt; east of it the Daulat Shám, or Government of Syria, claims\r\npossession.\r\n\r\nI have taken the liberty of calling the whole tract Midian; the\r\nsection above El-Muwaylah (Madyan Proper) I would term \"North\r\nMidian,\" and that below it \"South Midian.\" In the days of the\r\nancient Midianites the frontiers were so elastic that, at times,\r\nbut never for a continuity, they embraced Sinai, and were pushed\r\nforward even into Central Palestine. Moreover, I would prolong\r\nthe limits eastward as far as the Damascus-Medínah road. This\r\nwould be politically and ethnologically correct. With the\r\nexception of the Ma'ázah country, the whole belongs to Egypt; and\r\nall the tribes, formerly Nabathæan, are now more or less\r\nEgypto-Arab, never questioning the rights of his Highness the\r\nViceroy, who garrisons the seaboard forts. Of the other points,\r\nhistorical and geographical, I am not so sure. My learned friend,\r\nAloys Sprenger, remarks: \"Let me observe that your extending the\r\nname Midian' over the whole country, as far south as the\r\ndominions of the Porte, appears to me an innovation by which the\r\nidentity of the race along the shore of the Gulf of Akabah,\r\ncoast down to Wajh and Hawrá, is prejudged. Would it not be\r\nbetter to leave Midian where it always has been, and to consider\r\nBadá[EN#150] the centre of Thamûditis, as it was at the time of\r\nPliny and Ptolemy, and as it continued to be until the Balee\r\n(Baliyy), and other Qodhâ' (Kudá') tribes, came from Southern\r\nArabia, and exterminated the Thamûdites?\" This is, doubtless, a\r\nvalid objection: its only weak point is that it goes too far\r\nback. We cannot be Conservatives in geography and ethnology; nor\r\ncan we attach much importance, in the nineteenth century, to a\r\nrace, the Beni Tamúd, which had wholly disappeared before the\r\nseventh. On the whole, it still appears to me that by adopting my\r\ninnovation we gain more than we lose; but the question must be\r\nleft for others to decide.\r\n\r\nIn our days, two great Sultánis or \"highways\" bound Madyan the\r\nLess and Midian the Greater. The western, followed by the Hajj\r\nel-Misri (Egyptian caravan), dates from the age of Sultán Selim\r\nKhán the Conqueror; who, before making over the province to the\r\nlater Mamlúk Beys, levelled rocks, cut through ridges, dug wells,\r\nlaid out the track, and defended the line by forts. Before that\r\ntime the road ran, for convenience of water, to the east or\r\ninland: it was, in fact, the old Nabathaean highway which,\r\naccording to Strabo, connected Leukè Kóme with the western\r\ncapital, Petra. Further east, and far beyond the double chain of\r\nmaritime mountains, is the highway followed by the Hajj el-Shámi\r\n(Syrian or Damascus caravan), which sets out from Constantinople,\r\nmusters at Damascus, and represents the Sultan. On both these\r\nmain lines water is procurable at almost every station; and to\r\nthem military expeditions are perforce limited. The parallelogram\r\nbetween the two, varying in breadth, according to Wallin, from 90\r\nto 120 miles (direct and geographical), is irregularly supplied\r\nin places with springs, wells, and rain-pits, which can always be\r\nfilled up or salted by the Bedawin.\r\n\r\nThe main body of the Expedition, Mr. Clarke, MM. Marie and\r\nLacaze, Ahmed Kaptán, and Lieutenant Amir, set out from\r\nEl-Muwaylah at 6.30 a.m. (February 19th), escorted by the Sayyid\r\nand the three salaried Shaykhs, including our friend Furayj. The\r\nRemingtons numbered ten, and there were also ten picks, of whom\r\nfive waited upon the mules; of the sixty-one camels six were\r\ndromedaries, and as the road grew lighter our beasts of burden\r\nincreased, somehow or other, to sixty-four. The caravan now loads\r\nin twenty minutes instead of five hours; and when politiké, or\r\nfear of danger, does not delay us, we start in a quarter of an\r\nhour after the last bugle-sound. This operation is under charge\r\nof Lieutenant Amir, who does his best to introduce Dar-Forian\r\ndiscipline: the camels being first charged with the Finátís\r\n(\"metal water-barrels\"), then with the boxes, and lastly with the\r\ntents.\r\n\r\nAfter passing the ruins of Abú Hawáwit, we began at 9:15 a.m. to\r\nexchange the broad Wady Surr of the flat seaboard, with its tall\r\nbanks of stiff drab clay, for a gorge walled with old\r\nconglomerates, and threading the ruddy and dark-green foot-hills\r\nof the main Ghát. As in the Wady el-Maka'dah and other\r\n\"winter-brooks,\" the red porphyritic trap, heat-altered argil,\r\neasily distinguished by its fracture from the syenites of the\r\nsame hue, appeared to be iron-clad, coated with a thin crust of\r\nshiny black or brown peroxide (?). This peculiarity was noticed\r\nby Tuckey in the Congo, by Humboldt in the Orinoco, and by myself\r\nin the São Francisco river; I also saw it upon the sandstones of\r\nthe wild mountains east of Jerusalem, where, as here, air and not\r\nwater must affect the oxide of iron. In both cases, however, the\r\ncause would be the same, and the polish would be a burnishing of\r\nNature on a grand scale.\r\n\r\nAfter six very slow miles we halted, for rest and refection, at a\r\nthread of water in the section of the Surr which receives the\r\nWady el-Najil. The sides were crowded with sheep and goats, the\r\nlatter, as in the Syrian lowlands, almost invariably black; and\r\nthe adjoining rocks had peculiar attractions for hares, hawks,\r\nand partridge. In these upland regions water is almost\r\neverywhere, and generally it is drinkable; hence the Bedawin\r\nnaturally prefer them to the coast. An umbrella-shaped\r\nthorn-tree, actually growing on a hill-top, and defined by the\r\nsky-line, excited our wonder and admiration; for here, as in\r\nPontus--\r\n\r\n     \"Rara, nec hæc felix, in apertis eminet arvis\r\n           Arbor, et in terra est altera forma maris.\"\r\n\r\nIndeed, throughout our journey this spectacle always retained its\r\ncharms, aiding Fancy to restore the barrens to what they had been\r\nin the prosperous days of yore.\r\n\r\nThe Wady Surr now began to widen out, and to become more riant,\r\nwhilst porphyry was almost the only visible rock. After a total\r\nof ten \"dawdling\" miles, marching almost due east, we found our\r\ntents pitched in a broad and quasi-circular basin, called El-Safh\r\n(\"the level ground of\") Jebel Malíh (\"Mount Pleasant\"?), which\r\nthe broad-speaking Bedawin lengthen to Malayh. Our camel-men had\r\nhalted exactly between two waters, and equally distant from both,\r\nso as to force upon us the hire of extra animals. We did not\r\ngrumble, however, as we were anxious to inspect the Afrán\r\n(\"furnaces\") said to be found upon the upper heights of the\r\nShárr--of these apocryphal features more hereafter. Fresh\r\ndifficulties! The Jeráfín-Huwaytát tribe, that owns the country\r\nsouth of the Surr, could not be reached under a whole day of\r\ndromedary-riding: in reality they were camped a few furlongs off,\r\nbut anything to gain £8 per diem for doing nothing! Two Bedawi\r\nshepherd-lads promised to act guides next morning, and duly\r\nfailed to appear, or, more probably, were forbidden to appear.\r\nThey had also romanced about ruins, fountains, palms, and rushes\r\nin the Wady el-Kusayb, the south-eastern influent. At night Ahmed\r\nel-Ukbi, surnamed Abú Khartúm, arrived in camp: he had travelled\r\nmore than once to Tabúk, carrying grain, and though he had failed\r\nas a merchant, he retained his reputation as a guide. As regards\r\nthe furnaces, he also, like Furayj, could speak only from\r\nhearsay. Opinions were divided in camp: I saw clearly that a\r\nstand was being made to delay us for four or five days; and,\r\ndespite grumbling, I resolved upon deferring the visit till our\r\nreturn from the interior.\r\n\r\nThe first march had led us eastward, instead of north-eastward,\r\nin order to inspect the Wady Surr. From the seaboard, this line,\r\nwhich drains the northern flank of the Shárr Mountains, appears\r\nthe directest road into the interior. We shall presently see,\r\nhowever, why the devious northern way of the Wady Sadr has become\r\nthe main commercial route connecting El-Muwaylah with\r\nTabúk.[EN#151] During the evening we walked up the Wady Surr,\r\nfinding, in its precipitous walls, immense veins of serpentine\r\nand porphyritic greenstone, but not a speck of gold. The upper\r\npart of the Fiumara also showed abundant scatters of water-rolled\r\nstones, serpentines, and hard felspars, whose dove-coloured\r\nsurface was streaked with fibrils and at times with regular veins\r\nof silvery lustre, as if brought out by friction of the surface.\r\nI offered a considerable sum to a Jeráfín Bedawi if he would show\r\nthe rock in situ; he was evidently ignorant of it, but, like\r\nothers, he referred us to Jebel Malíh.\r\n\r\nThe whole of the next day (February 20th) was spent in northing.\r\nLeaving the noisy braying caravan to march straight on its\r\ndestination, we set out (6.15 a.m.) up the Wady Guwaymarah,\r\nguided by Hasan el-Ukbí, who declared that he well knew the\r\nsites of the ruined settlements El-Khulasah and El-Zibayyib.\r\nAfter walking half an hour we turned eastward into a feeder of\r\nthe Surr, the Wady el-Khulasah, whose aspect charmed me: this\r\ndrain of the inner Jedayl block was the replica of a Fiumara in\r\nSomali-land, a broad tree-dotted flat of golden sand, bordered on\r\neither side by an emerald avenue of dense Mimosas, forming line\r\nunder the green-stone hills to the right, and the red-stone\r\nheights to the left. The interior, we again remarked, is\r\nevidently more rained upon, and therefore less sterile and\r\ndesolate, than the coast and the sub-maritime regions; and here\r\none can well imagine large towns being built. At last, after\r\nwalking about an hour and a half (= four miles and a half)\r\ntowards the Shárr, with our backs turned upon our goal, the\r\nrat-faced little intriguer, Hasan, declared that he knew nothing\r\nabout El-Khulasah, but that Zibayyib lay there! pointing to a\r\nbright-red cliffy peak, \"Abá'l-bárid,\" on the left bank of the\r\nWady, and to others whose heads were blue enough and low enough\r\nto argue considerable distance. He had intended his cousin Gabr\r\nto be the real guide, and to take to himself all the credit; but\r\nI had sent off the parlous \"judge\" in another direction.\r\n\r\nMr. Clarke, whose cantering mule had no objection to leave its\r\nfellows, rode off with the recreant Hasan, whilst we awaited his\r\nreturn under a tree.\r\n\r\nInstead of hugging Abá'l-bárid, behind which a watercourse would\r\nhave taken him straight to his destination, he struck away from\r\nthe Wady el-Khulasah. Then crossing on foot, and hauling his\r\nanimal over, a rough divide, he fell, after six miles instead of\r\ntwo, into the upper course of the Wady Surr, which he reported to\r\nbe choked with stones, and refusing passage to loaded camels--as\r\nwill afterwards appear, the reverse is the case. The ruins of\r\nEl-Zibayyib lie at a junction of three, or rather four,\r\nwatercourses. The eastern is the Surr, here about five hundred\r\nyards broad, forming a bulge in the bed, and then bending\r\nabruptly to the south; a short line from the south-west, the Wady\r\nZibayyib, drains the Aba'l-bárid peak; and the northernmost is\r\nthe Wady el-Safrá,[EN#152] upon which the old place stands à\r\ncheval. The western part is the larger and the more ruinous. The\r\nthin line, three hundred yards long by thirty broad, never shows\r\nmore than two tenements deep, owing to the hill that rises behind\r\nit: here the only furnace was found. The eastern block measures\r\none hundred yards by forty; both are razed to their basements,\r\nresembling the miners' settlement on the Sharmá cliff. They\r\nattract attention only by their material, red boulders being used\r\ninstead of the green porphyries of the hills; and the now\r\ndesolate spot shows no signs of water or of palm-groves.\r\n\r\nMr. Clarke rejoined us after a couple of hours, having lost the\r\ndog Brahim: under a sudden change of diet it had become too\r\nconfident of its strength, and thus it is that dogs and men come\r\nto grief. We retraced our steps down the Wady el-Khulasah, whose\r\nJebel is the crupper of the little block Umm Jedayl. The lower\r\nvalley shows a few broken walls, old Arab graves, and other signs\r\nof ancient habitation; but I am convinced that we missed the\r\nruins which lay somewhere in the neighbourhood. One Sulaymán, a\r\nBedawi of the Selálimah-Huwaytát tribe, who had been rascalized\r\nby residence at El-Muwaylah, was hunted up by the energetic\r\nSayyid; hoping, as usual, that no action would be taken upon mere\r\nwords, he declared that El-Khulasah stood on the top of a\r\ntrap-lump. We halted to inspect it, and Lieutenant Amir rode the\r\nShaytánah, his vicious little she-mule, up and down steeps fit\r\nonly for a goat. Again all was in vain.\r\n\r\nWe then travelled over granite gravel along the western\r\nfoot-hills of Umm Jedayl, in which a human figure or statue had\r\nbeen reported to me: now, however, it became a Sarbút, or\r\n\"upright stone.\" Along the flanks of the chief outlier, the Jebel\r\nel-Ramzah, distinguished by its red crest and veins, the slope\r\nwas one strew of quartz, whole and broken; like that which we had\r\nseen to the north, and which we were to see on our southern\r\njourney. Despising the \"rotten water\" offered in two places by\r\nthe Umm Jedayl, we pitched camp on the fine gravel of the Sayl\r\nWady el-Jimm. Here I heard for the first time, after sighting it\r\nfor many weeks, that the latter is the name, not of a\r\nmountain,[EN#153] but of a Sha'b or \"gully\" in the Jebel Dibbagh\r\nwhere waters \"meet.\" The Wady Kh'shabriyyah, separating the Umm\r\nJedayl from its northern neighbour, the Dibbagh, looks like a\r\nhighway; but all declare that it is closed to camels by Wa'r, or\r\n\"stony ground.\" Of its ruins more when we travel to the Shárr.\r\nThis day's march of four hours (= ten miles and a half) had been\r\na series of zigzags--north, north-east, west, and again north.\r\n\r\nAfter a cool, pleasant night we set out at 6.30 a.m. (February\r\n21st), across the broad Sayl, towards a bay in the mountains\r\nbearing north-north-west, the mouth of the Wady Zennárah.\r\nEntering the block, we made two short cuts to save great bends in\r\nthe bed. The first was the Sha'b el-Liwéwi', the Weiwî of Wallin\r\n(p. 304)--wild riding enough; the path often winding almost due\r\neast, when the general direction was north-north-east. We saw,\r\nfor the first time, pure greenish-yellow chlorite outcropping\r\nfrom the granite. The animals were apparently hibernating, and\r\nplants were rare; we remarked chiefly the sorrel and the blue\r\nthistle, or rather wild artichoke, the Shauk el-Jemel, a thorn\r\nloved by camels (Blepharis edulis), which recalled to mind the\r\nhighlands of Syria. The second short-cut, the Wady el-Ga'agah,\r\nalias Sawáwín, was the worse of the two: the deep drops and\r\nnarrow gutters in the quartz-veined granite induced even the\r\nShaykhs to dismount before attacking the descents. This is rarely\r\ndone when ascending, for their beasts climb like Iceland ponies.\r\nOne of M. Lacaze's most effective croquis is that showing monture\r\nand man disappearing in the black depths of a crevice. Some of\r\nthe hill-crests were weathered with forms resembling the\r\nartificial. At the mid-day halting-ground we saw a stone-mother\r\nnursing a rock-child, which might still be utilized in lands\r\nwhere \"thaumaturgy\" is not yet obsolete.\r\n\r\nOur course thence lay eastward up the easy bed of the Fiumara, an\r\neastern section of an old friend, the Wady Tiryam; it now takes\r\nthe well-known name \"Wady Sadr,\" and we shall follow it to its\r\nhead in the Hismá. The scene is rocky enough for Scotland or\r\nScandinavia, with its huge walls bristling in broken rocks and\r\nblocks, its blue slides, and its polished sheets of dry\r\nwatercourse which, from afar, flash in the sun like living\r\ncataracts. On the northern or right bank rises the mighty Harb,\r\nwhose dome, single when seen from the west, here becomes a\r\nTridactylon, splitting into three several heads. Facing it, the\r\nnorthernmost end of the Dibbagh range forms a truncated tower,\r\nconspicuous far out at sea: having no name, it was called by us\r\nBurj Jebel Dibbagh. A little further to the east it will prove to\r\nbe the monstrous pommel of a dwarf saddleback, everywhere a\r\nfavourite shape with the granite outcrop.\r\n\r\nMM. Clarke and Lacaze, who had never before seen anything higher\r\nthat the hillocks of the Isle of Wight or the Buttes de\r\nMontmartre were hot upon ascending the almost perpendicular sides\r\nof the Burj, relying upon the parallel and horizontal fissures in\r\nthe face, which were at least ten to twenty feet apart. These\r\ndark marks, probably stained by oxide of iron, reminded me of\r\nthose which wrinkle the granitic peaks about Rio de Janeiro, and\r\nwhich have been mistaken for \"hieroglyphs.\"\r\n\r\nThe valley-sole is parti-coloured; the sands of the deeper line\r\nto the right are tinctured a pale and sickly green by the\r\ndegradation of the porphyritic traps, here towering in the\r\nlargest masses yet seen; while the gravel of the left bank is\r\nwarm, and lively with red grit and syenitic granite. Looking down\r\nthe long and gently waving line, we feel still connected with the\r\ncivilized world by the blue and purple screen of Sinai forming\r\nthe splendid back-ground. Everything around us appears deserted;\r\nthe Ma'ázah are up country, and the Beni Ukbah have temporarily\r\nquitted these grazing-grounds for the Surr of El-Muwaylah. We\r\ncamped for the night, after a total march of eleven miles, at the\r\nSayl el-Nagwah, a short Nullah at the foot of a granite block\r\nsimilarly named; and a gap supplied us with tolerable rain-water.\r\n\r\nOn the next day (February 22nd) we left the \"Nagwah\" at seven\r\ninstead of six a.m., and passed to the right a granitic outcrop\r\nin the Wady bed, a reduced edition of the Burj. After an hour's\r\nslow walking we were led by a Bedawi lad, Hasan bin Husayn, to a\r\nrock-spur projected northwards from the left side and separating\r\ntwo adjacent Sayls or \"torrent-beds,\" mere bays in the bank of\r\nmountains. A cut road runs to the top of the granite tongue,\r\nwhich faces the westernmost or down-stream outbreaks of the huge\r\nporphyritic masses on the other side of the Wady Sadr. The ridge\r\nitself is strewed with spalled stone, quartz broken from the\r\nveins that seam the granite, and with slag as usual admirably\r\nworked. Not a trace of human habitation appears, nor is there any\r\ntradition of a settlement having existed here; consequently we\r\nconcluded that this was another atelier of wandering workmen.\r\nBelow the rock-tongue we found for the first time oxydulated iron\r\nand copper, either free or engaged in trap and basaltic dykes:\r\nthe former metal, also attached in layers to dark-red vermeilled\r\njasper, here appears streaked with white quartz.\r\n\r\nResuming our ride, we dismounted, after four miles, at the\r\nhalf-way Mahattah (\"halting-place\"): it is a rond-point in the\r\nWady Sadr, marked from afar by a tall blue pyramid, the Jebel\r\nel-Ga'lah (Jálah). We spent some time examining this interesting\r\nbulge. Here the Jibál el-Tihámah end, and the eastern parallel\r\nrange, the Jibál el-Shafah, begins. The former belong to the\r\nHuwaytát and to Egypt; the latter, partly to the Ma'ázah and to\r\nSyria. The geographical frontier is well marked by two large\r\nwatercourses disposed upon a meridian, and both feeding the main\r\ndrain, the Sadr-Tiryam. To the north the Wady Sawádah divides the\r\ngranitic Harb from the porphyritic Jebel Sawádah; while the\r\nsouthern Wady Aylán separates the Dibbagh from the Jebel Aylán, a\r\ntall form distinctly visible from the Upper Shárr. The rest of\r\nour eastward march will now be through the Shafah massif. It\r\nresembles on a lower scale the Tihámah Gháts; but it wholly wants\r\ntheir variety, their beauty, and their grandeur. The granites\r\nwhich before pierced the porphyritic traps in all directions, now\r\nappear only at intervals; and this, I am told, is the case\r\nthroughout the northern, as we found it to be in the southern,\r\nprolongation of the \"Lip\"-range. At the same time there is no\r\ndistinct geographical separation between the two parallels; and\r\nboth appear, not as if parted by neutral ground, but rather as\r\ntopographical continuations of each other.\r\n\r\nWhile breaking our fast and resting the mules, a few shots\r\nringing ahead caused general excitement: we were now on the edge\r\nof the enemy's country. Presently three of the Ma'ázah came in\r\nand explained, with their barking voices, that their people had\r\nbeen practicing at the Níshán (\"target\"); which meant \"We have\r\npowder in abundance.\" One of them, at once dubbed El-Nasnás (\"the\r\nSatyr\") from his exceeding monstrous ugliness--a baboon's muzzle\r\nwith a scatter of beard--kindly volunteered to guide us, with the\r\nintention of losing the way. The dialogue that took place was\r\nsomething as follows:--\r\n\r\nWhat are your names ?\r\n\r\nA. Na'akal wa nashrab! Our names are \"We eat and We drink!\"\r\n\r\nWhere do we find water to-day?\r\n\r\nFurayj ejaculates, \"The water of the Rikáb!\"\r\n\r\nA. No, by Allah! The Arabs will never allow you to drink! You\r\nshould be killed for carrying off in Dumús (\"skins\") the sand of\r\nthe Wady Jahd (alluding to Lieutenant Amir's trip).\r\n\r\nWe did not pay much heed to these evil signs. Ahmed el-Ukbí had\r\nbeen sent forward to obtain a free pass from the chiefs, and we\r\nhardly expected that the outlying thieves would be daring enough\r\nto attack us.\r\n\r\nResuming our way, in a cold wind and a warm sun, up the upper\r\nWady Sadr, we threaded the various bends to the south and\r\nsouth-east, with a general south-south-eastern direction. The\r\nnormal dark-green traps and burnished red porphyries and grits\r\nwere sparsely clad with the Shauhat and the Yasár trees,\r\nresembling the Salvadora and the Tamarix. The country began to\r\nshow a few donkeys and large flocks of sheep and goats; the\r\nmuttons have a fine \"tog,\" and sell for three dollars and a half.\r\nThe women in charge, whose complexions appeared notably lighter\r\nthan those of the seaboard, barked like the men. They were much\r\npuzzled by a curious bleating which came from the mules; and\r\nhurriedly counted their kids, suspecting that one had been\r\npurloined, whilst they had some trouble to prevent the whole\r\nflock following us. All roared with laughter when they found that\r\nMr. Clarke was the performer.\r\n\r\nWe crossed two short cuts over long bends in the Wady; and at the\r\nsecond found a pot-hole of rain-water by no means fragrant,\r\nexcept to nostrils that love impure ammonia. It has a grand name,\r\nMuwah (for Miyáh) el-Rikáb (\"the Waters of the Caravan\"); and we\r\nmade free with it, despite the morning's threats. We again camped\r\nin the valley at an altitude of 2200 feet (aner. 27.80); and,\r\nthough the thermometer showed 66° F. at five p.m., fires inside\r\nand outside the mess-tent were required. A wester or sea-breeze,\r\ndeflected by the ravines to a norther, was blowing; and in these\r\nregions, as in the sub-frigid zones of Europe, wind makes all the\r\ndifference of temperature. During the evening we were visited by\r\nthe Ma'ázah Bedawin of a neighbouring encampment: they began to\r\nnotice stolen camels and to wrangle over past times--another bad\r\nsign.\r\n\r\nSetting out on a splendidly lucent morning (6:45 a.m., February\r\n23rd), when the towering heads of Harb and Dibbagh looked only a\r\nfew furlongs distant, we committed the imprudence of preceding,\r\nas usual, the escort. Our men had become so timid, starting at\r\nthe sight of every wretched Bedawi, that they made one long for a\r\n\"rash act.\" After walking about a mile and a half, we passed some\r\nblack tents on the left bank, where the Sadr enters a narrow\r\nrocky gorge; and suddenly about a dozen varlets were seen\r\nscampering over the walls, manning the Pass, and with lighted\r\nmatches threatening to fire. Then loud rang the war-song--\r\n\r\n     \"Hill el-Zawáib, hilla-há;\r\n     W'abdi Nuhúdak kulla-há!\"\r\n\r\n     \"Loose thy top-locks with a loosing (like a lion's mane);\r\n     And advance thy breast, all of it (opponite pectora without\r\nshrinking).\"\r\n\r\nOther varieties of the slogan are:--\r\n\r\n     \"O man of small mouth (un misérable)!\r\n     If we fail, who shall win?\"\r\n\r\nAnd--\r\n\r\n     \"By thy eyes (I swear), O she-camel, if we go (to the\r\nattack) and gird (the sword),\r\n     We will make it a day of sorrow to them, and avert from\r\nourselves every ill.\"\r\n\r\nWe dismounted, looked to our weapons, and began to parley. The\r\nragged ruffians, some of them mere boys, and these always the\r\nreadiest to blow the matches of guns longer than themselves,\r\nbegan with high pretensions. They declared that they would be\r\nsatisfied with nothing less than plundering us; they flouted\r\nShaykh Furayj, and they insulted the Sayyid, threatening to take\r\naway his sword.\r\n\r\nPresently the escort and the Arab camel-men were seen coming up\r\nat the double. The Ma'ázah at once became abject; kissed our\r\nheads and declared \"there was some mistake.\" I had already\r\nremarked, whilst the matchlock-men were swarming up the\r\nWady-sides, that the women and children remained in camp, and the\r\nsheep and goats were not driven off. This convinced me that\r\nnothing serious had been intended: probably the demonstration was\r\nordered from head-quarters in order to strike us with a wholesome\r\nawe.\r\n\r\nThe fellows gently reproached us with travelling through their\r\ncountry without engaging (and paying) Ghafír--\"guides and\r\nprotectors.\" So far, as owners of the soil, they were \"in their\r\nright;\" and manning a pass is here the popular way of levying\r\ntransit dues. On this occasion the number of our Remingtons\r\nsufficed to punish their insolence by putting the men to flight,\r\nand by carrying off their camels and flocks; but such a step\r\nwould have stopped the journey, and what would not the\r\n\"Aborigines Protection Society\" have said and done? I therefore\r\nhired one of the varlets, and both parties went their ways\r\nrejoicing that the peace had not been broken.\r\n\r\nThe valley, winding through the red and green hills, was dull and\r\nwarm till the cool morning easter, which usually set about eight\r\na.m., began to blow. The effect of increasing altitude showed\r\nitself in the vegetation. We now saw for the first time the Kidád\r\n(Astragalus), with horrid thorns and a flower resembling from\r\nafar the gooseberry: it is common on the Hismá and in the South\r\nCountry. The Kahlá (Echium), a bugloss, a borage-like plant, with\r\nviscous leaves and flowers of two colours,--the young light-pink\r\nand the old dark-blue,--everywhere beautified the sands, and\r\nreminded me of the Istrian hills, where it is plentiful as in the\r\nNile Valley. The Jarad-thorn was not in bloom; and the same was\r\nthe case with the hyacinth (Dipcadi erythraeum), so abundant in\r\nthe Hisma', which some of us mistook for a \"wild onion.\" The\r\nZayti (Lavandula) had just donned its pretty azure bloom. There\r\nwere Reseda, wild indigo, Tribulus (terrestris), the blue\r\nAristida, the pale Stipa, and the Bromus grass, red and yellow.\r\nThe Ratam (spartium), with delicate white and pink blossoms, was\r\na reminiscence of Tenerife and its glorious crater; whilst a\r\nlittle higher up, the amene Cytisus, flowering with gold, carried\r\nour thoughts back to the far past.\r\n\r\nPresently the great Fiumara opened upon a large basin denoting\r\nthe Ras (\"head\") Wady Sadr: native travellers consider this their\r\nsecond stage from El-Muwaylah. In front the Jibál Sadr extended\r\nfar to the right and left, a slight depression showing the\r\nKhuraytah, or \"Pass,\" which we were to ascend on the morrow.\r\nButtressing the left bank of the broad watercourse was the dwarf\r\nhill of which we had been told so many tales. By day its red\r\nsands gleam and glisten like burnished copper; during the night\r\nfire flashes from the summit: in truth, its sole peculiarity is\r\nthat of being yellow amongst the gloomy heights around it; whilst\r\nthe Wady el-Safrá, higher up to the left, discharges from its\r\nJebel a torrent of quartz and syenite, gravel and sand. Abú\r\nKhartám, the author of the romance, was among the party: he only\r\nsmiled when complimented upon the power of his imagination.\r\n\r\nThis was a day of excitement: even the mules kept their ears\r\npricked up. After a short nine miles we had camped below the\r\nJebel Kibár, and we had remounted our animals to ascend a\r\nneighbouring hill commanding a bird's-eye view of the Hismá\r\nplain. There was evidently much excitement amongst the Bedawi\r\nshepherds around us; and presently Ahmed el-Ukbí, our messenger,\r\nappeared in sight, officially heading the five chiefs of the\r\nMa'ázah, who were followed by a tail of some thirty clansmen.\r\nOnly two rode horses, wretched garrons stolen from the Ruwalá,\r\nthe great branch of the Anezah, which holds the eastern regions;\r\nthe rest rode fine sturdy and long-coated camels, which looked\r\nSyrian rather than Midianite.[EN#154] We returned hurriedly to\r\nmake arrangements for the reception: our Shaykhs could not,\r\nwithout derogating, go forth to meet the strangers; but the\r\nlatter were saluted with due ceremony by the bugler and the\r\nescort, drawn up in line before the mess-tent.\r\n\r\nAfter the usual half-hour's delay, the \"palaver,\" to speak\r\nAfricanicè, \"came up,\" and M. Lacaze had a good opportunity of\r\nprivily sketching the scene. The Shaykh, Mohammed bin Atíyyah,\r\nwho boasts (falsely) that he commands more than half the two\r\nthousand males composing the tribe, is a tall, sinewy man of\r\nabout fifty, straight-featured, full-bearded, and gruff-voiced:\r\nhis official style of speaking from the throat, a kind of vaccine\r\nlow, imitated in camp for many a day, never failed to cause\r\nmerriment. His costume rose to the height of Desert-fashion,\r\ndescribed when pourtraying Shaykh Khizr the Imráni; his manners\r\nwere those of a gentleman below the Pass, and above it he became\r\nan unmitigated ruffian, who merited his soubriquet El-Kalb (\"the\r\nHound\"). On one side sat his son Sálim, a large, beardless lad,\r\nwho had begun work by presenting us with a sheep--Giorgi (cook)\r\nsaid it cost us £40. On the other was his eldest brother and\r\nalter ego: the wrinkled Sagr (Sakr) has been a resident at Cairo,\r\nand still boasts that he received the \"tribute\" of a horse from\r\nthe Viceroy, whom he affects to treat as an equal or rather an\r\ninferior. The others were old Sagr's ill-visaged son Ali, and,\r\nlastly, a cunning-eyed villain, Abayd bin Sálim, the rightful\r\nheir to the chieftainship, which, however, he had been unable to\r\nkeep. All the Shaykhs were dressed in brand-new garments and\r\nglaring glossy Kúfíyahs (\"head-kerchiefs\"); they trade chiefly\r\nwith Mezáríb in the Haurán; and, during the annual passage to and\r\nfro of the Damascus caravan, they await it at Tabúk, and threaten\r\nto cut off the road unless liberally propitiated with presents of\r\nraiment and rations. The Murátibah (honorarium) contributed by\r\nEl-Shám would be about one hundred dollars in ready money to the\r\nheadman, diminishing with degree to one dollar per annum: this\r\nwould not include \"free gifts\" by pilgrims. The Ma'ázah are under\r\nSyria, that is, under no rule at all; and they are supposed to be\r\ntributary to, when in reality they demand tribute from, the\r\nPorte. In fact, nothing can be more pronounced than the contrast\r\nof the Bedawin who are subject to Egypt, and those supposed to be\r\ngoverned by the wretched Ottoman.\r\n\r\nDuring the palaver all outside was sweet as honey, to use the\r\nArab phrase, and bitter as gall inside. The Ma'ázah, many of whom\r\nnow saw Europeans for the first time, eyed the barnetá (hat)\r\ncuriously, with a certain facial movement which meant, \"This is\r\nthe first time we have let Christian dogs into our land!\" They\r\nwere minute in observing the escort, and not a little astonished\r\nto find that all were negroes--in the old day Egyptian soldiers,\r\nunder the great Mohammed Ali Pasha and his stepson, Ibrahim\r\nPasha, had made themselves a terror to the Wild Man. \"What had\r\nnow become of them?\" was the mental question. When asked whence\r\nthey had procured the two horses, they answered curtly, Min\r\nRabbiná--\"From our Lord,\" thus signifying stolen goods; and, like\r\nmediaeval knights, they took a pride in avowing that not one of\r\ntheir number could read or write. Finally a tent was assigned to\r\nthem; food was ordered, and they promised us escort to their dens\r\non the morrow.\r\n\r\nDuring the raw and gusty night the mercury sank to 38° F., the\r\naneroid (26.91) showing about three thousand feet above\r\nsea-level; and blazing fires kept up within and without the\r\ntents, hardly sufficed for comfort. On the morning of February\r\n24th\r\n\r\n     \"Over the wold the wind blew cold;\"\r\n\r\nand the Egyptian officers all donned their gloves. The early\r\nhours were spent in a last struggle with our Shaykhs, who now\r\nfelt themselves and their camels hopelessly entering the lion's\r\nlair. The sole available pretext for delay was that their animals\r\ncould never carry the boxes and tents up the Pass; but, though\r\nvery ugly reports prevailed concerning the reception of Ahmed\r\nel-Ukbí, and the observations that had been made last night, not\r\na word was suffered to reach my ears until our retreat had been\r\nresolved upon. Such concealment would have been inexcusable in a\r\nEuropean; in the East it is the rule.\r\n\r\nAt 7.15 a.m. we struck the camp at Jebel Kibár, and moved due\r\neastward towards the Pass. This north-eastern Khuraytah (Col) is\r\ntermed the Khuraytat el-Hismá or el-Jils, after a hillock on the\r\nplateau-summit, to distinguish it from the similar feature to the\r\nsouth-west: the latter is known as the Khuraytat el-Zibá; or\r\nel-T h m , the local pronunciation of Tihámah. About two miles of\r\nrough and broken ground lead to the foot of the ladder. The\r\nzigzags then follow the line of a mountain torrent, the natural\r\nPass, crossing its bed from left to right and from right again to\r\nleft: the path is the rudest of corniches, worn by the feet of\r\nman and beast; and showing some ugly abrupt turns. The absolute\r\nheight of the ascent is about 450 feet (aner. 26.70--26.25) and\r\nthe length half a mile. The ground, composed mostly of irregular\r\nrock-steps, has little difficulty for horses and mules; but\r\ncamels laden with boards (the mess-table) and long tent-poles\r\nmust have had a queer time--I should almost expect after this to\r\nsee an oyster walking up stairs. Of course, they took their\r\nleisure, feeling each stone before they trusted it, but they all\r\narrived without the shadow of an accident; and the same was the\r\ncase during the two subsequent descents.\r\n\r\nWe halted on the Sath el-Nakb (\"the Passtop\") to expect the\r\ncaravan, and to prospect the surrounding novelties. Heaps and\r\npiles of dark trap dotted the summit like old graves; many of the\r\nstones were inscribed with tribal marks, and not a few were\r\ncapped with snowy lumps of quartz detached from their veins in\r\nthe porphyry. This custom, which appears universal throughout\r\nMidian, has many interpretations. According to some it denotes\r\nthe terminus of a successful raid; others make it show where a\r\ndispute was settled without bloodshed; whilst as a rule it is an\r\nexpression of gratitude: the Bedawi erects it in honour of the\r\nman who protected or who did a service to him, saying at the same\r\ntime, Abyaz alayk yá Fula'n--\"White (or happy) be it to thee!\"\r\nnaming the person. Amongst these votive stones we picked up\r\ncopper-stained quartz like that of Aynúnah, fine specimens of\r\niron, and the dove-coloured serpentine, with silvery threads, so\r\nplentiful in the Wady Surr. The Wasm in most cases showed some\r\nform of a cross, which is held to be a potent charm by the\r\nSinaitic Bedawin; and on two detached water-rolled pebbles were\r\ndistinctly inscribed lH and Vl, which looked exceedingly like\r\nEurope. Apparently the custom is dying out: the modern Midianites\r\nhave forgotten the art and mystery of tribal signs (Wusúm). In\r\nmany places the people cannot distinguish between inscriptions\r\nand \"Bill Snooks his mark,\" and they can interpret very few of\r\nthe latter.\r\n\r\nLooking westward through the inverted arch formed by the two\r\nhill-staples of the Khuraytah, and down the long valley which had\r\ngiven us passage, the eye distinguishes a dozen distances whose\r\nseveral planes are marked by all the shades of colour that the\r\nmost varied vegetation can show. There are black-browns,\r\nchocolate-browns, and light umber-browns; bright-reds and\r\ndull-reds; grass-greens and cypress-greens; neutral tints and\r\nFrench greys contrasting with the rosy pinks, the azures, the\r\npurples, and the golden yellows with which distance paints the\r\nhorizon. From a few feet above the Col-floor appear the eastern\r\nfaces of the giants of the coast-range; and our altitude, some\r\n3800 feet, gave us to a certain extent a measure of their grand\r\nproportions.\r\n\r\nWe now stand upon the westernmost edge of the great central\r\nArabian plateau, known as El-Nejd (\"the Highlands\"), opposed to\r\nEl-Tihámah, the lowland regions. In Africa we should call it the\r\n\"true\" subtending the \"false\" coast; delightful Dahome compared\r\nwith leprous Lagos. This upland, running parallel with the\r\n\"Lip\"-range and with the maritime Gháts, is the far-famed Hismá.\r\nIt probably represents a remnant of the old terrace which, like\r\nthe Secondary gypseous formation, has been torn to pieces by the\r\nvolcanic region to the east, and by the plutonic upheavals to the\r\nwest. The length may be 170 miles; the northern limit is either\r\nclose to or a little south of Fort Ma'án; and we shall see its\r\nsouthern terminus sharply defined on a parallel with the central\r\nShárr, not including \"El-Jaww.\"[EN#155] An inaccessible fortress\r\nto the south, it is approached on the south-west by difficult\r\npasses, easily defended against man and beast. Further north,\r\nhowever, the Wadys Afál near El-Sharaf, El-Hakl (Hagul), and\r\nEl-Yitm at El-Akabah, are easy lines without Wa'r (\"stony\r\nground\") or Nakb (\"ravines\").\r\n\r\nThe Hismá material is a loose modern sandstone, showing every hue\r\nbetween blood-red, rose pink, and dead, dull white: again and\r\nagain fragments had been pointed out to us near the coast, in\r\nruined buildings and in the remains of handmills and rub-stones.\r\nPossibly the true coal-measures may underlie it, especially if\r\nthe rocks east of Petra be, as some travellers state, a region of\r\nthe Old, not the New Red. According to my informants, the Hismá\r\nhas no hills of quartz, a rock which appears everywhere except\r\nhere; nor should I expect the region to be metalliferous.\r\n\r\nWe ascended the Jebel el-Khuraytah, a trap hillock some 120 feet\r\nhigh, the southern jamb of the Khuraytah gate: the summit, where\r\nstands a ruined Burj measuring fourteen metres in diameter, gives\r\na striking and suggestive view. After hard dry living on grisly\r\nmountain and unlovely Wady, this fine open plain, slightly\r\nconcave in the centre, was a delightful change of diet to the\r\neye--the first enjoyable sensation of the kind, since we had\r\ngazed lovingly upon the broad bosom of the Wady el-Arabah. The\r\ngeneral appearance is that of Eastern Syria, especially the\r\nHaurán: at the present season all is a sheet of pinkish red,\r\nwhich in later March will turn to lively green. On this parallel\r\nthe diameter does not exceed a day's march, but we see it\r\nbroadening to the north. Looking in that direction over the\r\ngloomy-metalled porphyritic slopes upon which we stand, the\r\nglance extends to a manner of sea-horizon; while the several\r\nplanes below it are dotted with hills and hill-ranges, white,\r\nred, and black, all dwarfed by distance to the size of thimbles\r\nand pincushions. The guides especially pointed out the ridge\r\nEl-Mukaykam, a red block upon red sands, and a far-famed\r\nrendezvous for raid and razzia. Nearer, the dark lumps of\r\nEl-Khayráni rise from a similar surface; nearer still lie the two\r\nwhite dots, El-Rakhamatayn; and nearest is the ruddy ridge Jebel\r\nand Jils el-Rawiyán, containing, they say, ruins and inscriptions\r\nof which Wallin did not even hear.\r\n\r\nThe eastern versant of the Hismá is marked by long chaplets of\r\ntree and shrub, disposed along the selvage of the watercourses;\r\nand the latter are pitted with wells sunk after the fashion of\r\nthe Bedawin. In this rhumb the horizon is bounded by El-Harrah,\r\nthe volcanic region whose black porous lavas and honey-combed\r\nbasalts, often charged with white zeolite, are still brought down\r\neven to the coast to serve as mortars and handmills. The profile\r\nis a long straight and regular line, as if formed under water,\r\ncapped here and there by a tiny head like the Syrian Kulayb\r\nHaurán: its peculiar dorsum makes it distinguishable from afar,\r\nand we could easily trace it from the upper heights of the Shárr.\r\nIt is evidently a section of the mighty plutonic outburst which\r\nhas done so much to change the aspect of the parallel Midian\r\nseaboard. Wallin's account of it (p. 307) is confined to the\r\nplace where he crossed the lava-flood; and he rendered El-Harrah,\r\nwhich in Arabic always applies to a burnt region, by\r\n\"red-coloured sandstone.\"\r\n\r\nThe Bedawin far more reasonably declare that this Harrah is not a\r\nmere patch as it appears in Wallin's map, a narrow oblong not\r\nexceeding sixty miles (north lat. 27°--28°), disposed diagonally\r\nfrom north-west to south-east. According to them, it is a region\r\nat least as large as the Hismá; and it extends southwards not\r\nonly to the parallel of El-Medínah, but to the neighbourhood of\r\nYambú'. The upper region has two great divisions: the\r\nHarrat-Hismá or the Harrah par excellence, which belongs to the\r\nMa'ázah, and which extends southwards through El-Sulaysilah as\r\nfar as the Jaww. The latter region, a tract of yellow sand,\r\ndotted with ruddy hills, apparently a prolongation of the Hismá,\r\nseparates it from the Harrat el-Awayraz, in which the Jebel\r\nel-Muharrak lies.[EN#156] This line of volcanism is continued\r\nsouth by the Harrat el-Mushrif (P.N. of a man); by the Harrat\r\nSutúh Jaydá; and, finally, by the Harrat el-Buhayri. the latter\r\nshows close behind the shore at El-Haurá, in nearly the same\r\nlatitude as El-Medínah, where we shall presently sight it. There\r\nis great interest and a general importance in this large\r\ncoast-subtending eruptive range, whose eastern counterslope\r\ndemands long and careful study.\r\n\r\nSweeping the glance round to south, we see the southern of the\r\ntwo Jilsayn, tall mounds of horizontal strata, with ironstone in\r\nharder lines and finial blocks. This is the Jils el-Dáim, so\r\ndistinguished from the northern Jils el-Rawiyán. The lower edge\r\nof the Hismá swells up in red and quoin-like masses, the Jibál\r\nel-Záwiyah, and then falls suddenly, with a succession of great\r\nbreaks, into the sub-maritime levels. During our next ten days'\r\ntravel we shall be almost in continuous sight of its southern\r\nramparts and buttresses. Far over the precipices lie the low\r\nyellow sands of the Rahabah, alias the Wady Dámah; and behind it\r\nrises the sky-blue mountain block, which takes a name from the\r\nruins of Shaghab and Shuwák.\r\n\r\nWe breakfasted upon the Khuraytah crest; and Mr. Clarke set out\r\nto shoot the fine red-legged \"Greek\" partridges (caccabis) that\r\nhaunt the hilltops, whilst the rest of us marched with the\r\ncaravan to the nearest camping-ground. About a mile from the Col,\r\nand lying to the west of the Jils el-Rawiyán, it is supplied with\r\nexcellent drinking-water by the Miyáh el-Jedayd, lying nine\r\nhundred to a thousand metres to the south-east. On the other\r\nhand, fuel, here a necessary of life, was wanting; nor could the\r\ncamels find forage. Thus we were camped upon the western edge of\r\nthe Hismá. The Ma'ázah Shaykhs, who vainly urged us forwards,\r\nshowed a suspicious disappointment at our not reaching their\r\nquarters on the far side, where, they said, a camel was awaiting\r\nto be slaughtered for our reception.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, we were enjoying the reverse of hospitality. The\r\nBedawin evidently now held that all which was ours had become\r\ntheirs. Their excessive greed made them imprudent. Not satisfied\r\nwith \"eating us up,\" with a coffee-pot ever on the fire, with\r\ndemanding endless tobacco, and with making their two garrons\r\ndevour more barley than our eight mules, they began to debate,\r\naloud as usual, how much ready money they should demand. This was\r\nat last settled at four hundred dollars; and the talk was\r\nreported to me by the Básh-Buzúk Husayn, whom they had compelled\r\nto cook for them. At the same time unpleasant discussions were\r\nbeginning: \"This man stole my camel!\" \"That man killed my\r\nfather,\" already took the form of threats; in fact, I almost\r\nrepented having brought the Huwaytát and their camels into the\r\ntrap. Still they all respected Furayj, as might be seen by their\r\nrising and making room for him whenever he approached the fire.\r\n\r\nAt last an evil rumour arose that the Ma'ázah had determined to\r\nsupply us with transport, and had sent messengers in all\r\ndirections to collect the animals. This step looked uncommonly\r\nlike a gathering of war-men. I was sorely disappointed, for more\r\nreasons than one. The state of affairs rendered a distant march\r\nto the east highly unadvisable. The principal object of this\r\njourney had been to investigate the inland depth of the\r\nmetalliferous deposits; in fact, their extent from west to east.\r\nTheir north-south length would be easily ascertained, but the\r\nwidth would still remain unknown. The \"Land of Midian,\" through\r\nwhich we have been travelling, has evidently been worked, and in\r\nplaces well worked; thus the only chance of finding a virgin\r\nCalifornia would be in the unknown tracts lying to the east of\r\nthe \"Harrahs.\" Too bad to be thwarted in such a project by the\r\nexorbitant demands of a handful of thieves!\r\n\r\nThe disappointment was aggravated by other considerations. From\r\nall that I had heard, the Hismá is a region full of archæological\r\ninterest. Already we were almost in sight of the ruins of Ruáfá,\r\nlying to the north between the two white dots El-Rakhamatayn.\r\nFurther eastward, and north of the pilgrim-station Zát-Hajj, are\r\nthe remains of Karáyyá, still unvisited by Europeans. Finally, I\r\nhad been shown, when too late to inspect the place, a fragment of\r\na Nabathæan inscription, finely cut in soft white\r\nsandstone:[EN#157] it had been barbarously broken, and two other\r\npieces were en route. The stone is said to be ten feet long (?),\r\nall covered with \"writings,\" from which annalistic information\r\nmight be expected: it lies, or is said to lie, about two hours'\r\nride north of our camp, and beyond the Jils el-Rawiyán famed for\r\nHawáwít. At first I thought of having it cut to portable size;\r\nbut second thoughts determined me to leave it for another visit\r\nor for some more fortunate visitor. Lastly, we were informed, a\r\nfew weeks afterwards, that the Ma'ázah Shaykhs had carried it off\r\nto their tents--I fear piecemeal.\r\n\r\nIt was not pleasant to beat a retreat; but, under the\r\ncircumstances, what else could be done? No one was to be relied\r\nupon but the Europeans, and not all even of them. The black\r\nescort, emancipated slaves, would have run away at the first\r\nshot; except only Acting-Corporal Khayr. And when I told the\r\nofficers assembled at mess that we should march back early next\r\nmorning, the general joy showed how little they relished the\r\nprospect of an advance. Then came out in mass the details--many\r\ndoubtless apocryphal--which should have been reported to me, and\r\nwhich had carefully been kept secret. The Ma'ázah, when our\r\nmessenger first notified our visit, had declared that they would\r\nhave no Nazarenes in their mountains; that they did not care a\r\nfico for Egypt. Why had not \"Effendíná\" written to them? they\r\nwere his equals, not his subjects! It was then debated whether\r\nthey should not raise a force of dromedary-men to fall upon us.\r\nSome of them proposed to summon to their aid the rival chief, Ibn\r\nHermás; but the majority thought it would be better to reserve\r\nfor themselves the hundred dollars per diem, of which they\r\nproposed to fleece us.\r\n\r\nOf course, everything around us was intrigue; the Máyat taht\r\nel-Tibn (\"water under the straw\") of the Arab saying. Furayj, it\r\nis true, looked serene, and privately offered me to fight the\r\naffair out; but he was alone in the idea. The Sayyid was\r\ntranquil, as usual; Hasan the Ukbi wore an unpleasant appearance\r\nof satisfaction, as if he had been offered a share in the plunder\r\nof the Huwaytát; and Alayán, a brave man on his own ground,\r\ncould hardly conceal his dejection. I might, it is evident, have\r\nseized Shaykh Mohammed, placed a pistol to his ear, and carried\r\nhim off a prisoner; but such grands moyens must be reserved for\r\ngreat occasions. The worst symptoms in camp were that the Ma'ázah\r\nat once knew the whole of my project; while the Egyptian officers\r\nwere ever going to their tents, and one stayed talking with them\r\ntill near midnight.\r\n\r\nFebruary 25th was a day of humiliation. I aroused the camp at\r\n4.30 a.m., and at once gave orders to strike the tents and load.\r\nThe command was obeyed in double quick time; but not before\r\nShaykh Mohammed had visited us to propose a march to his home in\r\nthe east. He was not comfortable; probably his reinforcements had\r\nstill to arrive: his face was calm, as the Eastern's generally\r\nis; but his feet trembled, and his toes twitched. I drily told\r\nhim of our changed plans, and he left us in high dudgeon. The\r\ntragi-comedy which followed may be divided into six acts:--\r\n\r\n1. The Ma'ázah mount their horses and camels: I walk up to them,\r\nand expostulate about so abrupt a departure without even drinking\r\na friendly cup of coffee.\r\n\r\n2. They dismount, and squat in council round the fire, sending on\r\nthree dromedary-riders to crown a hill commanding the pass. The\r\n\"burning question\" is now whether armed clansmen are or are not\r\nlurking behind the heights.\r\n\r\n3. Shaykh Mohammed comes forward, and demands blackmail to the\r\nextent of two hundred dollars. I offer one hundred dollars.\r\n\r\n4. Our hosts break off the debate in a towering rage; refuse\r\ncoffee, and declare that the caravan of \"Effendíná\" (the Viceroy)\r\nshall not be loaded. Mohammed's feet twitch more violently as the\r\ncamels are made to kneel.\r\n\r\n5. The caravan shows too much emotion. I pay the two hundred\r\ndollars into the chief's hands. He at once demands his Sharaf\r\n(\"honour\") in the shape of a Kiswah, or handsome dress, and, that\r\nfailing, an additional twenty-five dollars for each of the five\r\nheadmen. I promise that a robe shall be sent from\r\nEl-Muwaylah.[EN#158]\r\n\r\n6. The caravan sets out for the Pass, when the three\r\ndromedary-riders open with the war-cry: it is stopped with much\r\napparatus by the Shaykhs, who affect to look upon it as\r\ndangerous.\r\n\r\n                           * * * * *\r\n\r\nWe now marched without delay upon the Col, which was reached at\r\n8:15 a.m.; Mohammed bin Atíyyah having meanwhile disappeared. We\r\ndescended the Khuraytat el-Jils in twenty-six minutes, and\r\ndismissed the remainder of our Ma'ázah escort at the foot. I\r\nvainly offered them safeguard to El-Muwaylah, which they have not\r\nvisited for the last dozen years; all refused absolutely to pass\r\ntheir own frontiers.\r\n\r\nAu revoir Mohammed ibn Atíyyah and company!\r\n\r\nHaving broken our fast and sent forward the caravan, we at once\r\nbegan to descend the southern Pass, the Khuraytat el-Zibá. Here\r\nthe watershed of the Wady Surr heads; and merchants object to\r\ntravel by its shorter line, because their camels must ascend two\r\nladders of rocks, instead of one at the top of the Wady Sadr. The\r\nCol was much longer and but little less troublesome than its\r\nnorthern neighbour; the formation was the same, and forty-five\r\nminutes placed us in a gully, that presently widened to a big\r\nvalley, the Wady Dahal or El-Khuraytah. We reached it at 12:30\r\np.m., and laid down the distance from the summit of the northern\r\nCol at about five miles and a quarter. The air felt tepid, the\r\nsun waxed hot; drinking-water was found on the left of the bed,\r\nand a hole in the sole represented a spring, which the people say\r\nis perennial: we were dismounting to quench our thirst at the\r\nlatter, when Juno plunged into it, and stood quietly eyeing us\r\nwith an air of intense satisfaction.\r\n\r\nWe spent that night at a place lower down the Wady Dahal, known\r\nas the Jayb el-Khuraytah (\"Collar of the Col\"). The term \"Jayb\"\r\nis locally applied to two places only; the other being the Jayb\r\nel-Sa'lúwwah, which we shall presently visit. A larger feature\r\nthan a Wady, it reminds us of a Norfolk \"broad,\" but it is of\r\ncourse waterless. Guards were placed around the camp; and a\r\nwholesome dread of the Ma'ázah kept them wide awake. The only\r\nevil which resulted was that none dared to lead our mules to\r\nwater; and the poor animals were hardly rideable on the next day.\r\n\r\nOf the Hismá in its present state, we may say as of Ushant, Qui\r\nvoit Ouessant, voit la mort. Nothing can be done towards working\r\nthe mines of Midian until this den of thieves is cleared out. It\r\nis an asylum for every murderer and bandit who can make his way\r\nthere--a centre of turbulence which spreads trouble all around\r\nit. Under the sham rule of miserable Shám (Syria), with its\r\nTurkish Wális, men like the late Ráshid Pasha, matters can only\r\nwax worse. Subject to Egypt, the people will learn discipline and\r\ncease to torment the land.\r\n\r\nHappily for their neighbours there will be no difficulty in\r\nreducing the Ma'ázah. They are surrounded by enemies, and they\r\nhave lately been obliged to pay \"brother-tax\" to the Ruwalá as a\r\ndefence against being plundered: the tribute consists of one\r\npiece of hair-cloth about twenty cubits long. On the north, as\r\nfar as El-Ma'án, they meet the hostile Beni Sakr (Jawázi), under\r\nthe Shaykh Mohammed ibn Jázi; southwards the Baliyy, commanded by\r\nShaykh Afnán, are on terms of \"blood\" with them; eastward stand\r\nthe Anezah and the warlike Sharárát-Hutaym, who ever covet their\r\ntwo thousand camels: westward lie in wait their hereditary foes,\r\nthe Huwaytát. Shaykh Furayj, the tactician, has long ago proposed\r\na general onslaught of his tribesmen by a simultaneous movement\r\nup the Wadys Surr, Sadr, Urnub, and Afál: they seemed to have\r\nsome inkling of his intentions, as they hastened to conclude with\r\nhim a five months' Altwah or \"truce.\" Finally, a small\r\ndisciplined force, marching down the Damascus-Medínah\r\npilgrimage-road to the east, and co-operating with the Huwayta't\r\non the west would place this vermin between two fires.\r\n\r\nThe tale of my disappointment may conclude with an ethnological\r\nnotice of those who caused it.\r\n\r\nThe Ma'ázah is a Syro-Egypto-Bedawi clan, originally Arab, or\r\nrather Syrian, but migratory, as are all Arabs. It now extends\r\nhigh up the valley of the Nile, and it is still found in the Wady\r\nMusá (of Suez) and on the Za'faránah block. Even in Egypt it is\r\nturbulent and dangerous: the men are professional robbers; and\r\ntheir treachery is uncontrolled by the Bedawi law of honour--they\r\nwill eat bread and salt with the traveller whom they intend to\r\nmurder. For many years it was unsafe to visit the camps within\r\nsight of Suez, until a compulsory residence at head-quarters\r\ntaught the Shaykhs manners. The habitat in Arabia stretches from\r\nthe Wady Musá of Petra, where they are kinsmen of the Tiyáhah,\r\nthe Bedawin of the Tíh-desert; and through Ma'án as far as the\r\nBirkat el-Mu'azzamah, south of Tabúk. Finally, they occupy the\r\ngreater part of the Hismá and the northern Harrah.\r\n\r\nAccording to Mohammed el-Kalb, these bandits own the bluest of\r\nblue blood. Their forefather was one Wáíl, who left by his\r\ndescendants two great tribes. The first and the eldest took a\r\nname from their Ma'áz (\"he-goats\"); while the junior called\r\nthemselves after the Annáz (\"she-goats\"): from the latter sprung\r\nthe great Anezah family, which occupies the largest and the\r\nchoicest provinces of the Arabian peninsula. Meanwhile\r\ngenealogists ignore the Ma'ázah.\r\n\r\nWallin would divide the tribe into two, the Ma'ázah and the \"Beni\r\nAtiyá:\" of the latter in Midian I could hear nothing except that\r\nthey represent the kinsmen of the Shaykh's family. We find \"Benoo\r\nAteeyah\" in maps like that of Crichton's (1834), where the\r\nMa'ázah are laid down further south; and northwards the Beni\r\nAtiyyah are a powerful clan who push their razzias as far as the\r\nfrontiers of Moab. My informants declare that the numbers of\r\nfighting men in the Midianite division of the race may be two\r\nthousand (two hundred?), and that they are separated only by\r\nallegiance to two rival Shaykhs. The greater half, under Ibn\r\nHermás, is distributed into five clans, of whom the first, Orbán\r\nKhumaysah, contain two septs. Under Mohammed ibn Atíyyah\r\n(El-Kalb) they number also five divisions. Amongst them are the\r\nSubút or Beni Sabt, \"Sons of the Sabbath,\" that is, Saturday;\r\nwhom Wallin suspects to be of Jewish origin, relying, it would\r\nappear, principally upon their name. The ringing of the large\r\nbell suspended to the middle pole of the tents at sunset, \"to\r\nhail the return of the camels and the mystic hour of descending\r\nnight,\" is an old custom still maintained, because it confers a\r\nBarakat (\"blessing\") upon the flocks and herds. Certainly there\r\nis nothing of the Bedawi in this practice, and it is distinctly\r\ncontrary to the tradition of El-Islam; yet many such survivals\r\nhold their ground amongst the highly conservative Wild Men, and\r\nthey must be looked upon only as local and tribal peculiarities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Vol. I.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Endnotes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[EN#1] My collection dates from between the first century B.C.\r\nand the first century A.D.; this can be gathered from comparison\r\nwith the coins of Alexander Jannaeus and his successor, Alexander\r\nII. The tetradrachm may belong to the reign of Alexander the\r\nGreat, or the ages preceding it.\r\n\r\n[EN#2] Here probably disappeared some fine specimens of silicate\r\nof copper which caused a delay of three months in the report.--R.\r\nF. B.\r\n\r\n[EN#3] Messrs. Edgar Jackson found in the same box:--\r\n\r\nSilver (per statute ton)...............2 oz. 17 dwts. 11 grs.\r\n\r\n[EN#4] \"Box No. 37\" yielded silver....13 dwts. 1.6 grs.\r\n\r\n[EN#5] \"Box. No. 47\" yielded silver...12 dwts. 1.6 grms.\r\n\r\n[EN#6] In boxes Nos. 48 and 51 Mr. Jenken found silver 2 oz. 13\r\ndwts. 8 grs.; and 4 oz. 5 dwts. 12 grms.\r\n\r\n[EN#7] In a fragment of similar \"turquoise rock,\" from the same\r\nsite (Ziba), Dr. L. Karl Moser, of Trieste, found silver.\r\n\r\n[EN#8] In a fragment of similar chalcedony, from the same site\r\n(Aba'l-Maru), Dr. Moser found specks of \"free gold.\"\r\n\r\n[EN#9] This was the \"splendid button\" smelted at Makna.\r\n\r\n[EN#10] The \"button\" was pronounced to be almost pure antimony in\r\nthe Government Establishment of Mines, Trieste.\r\n\r\n[EN#11] In \"box No. 4\" Messrs. Jackson found rough crystals of\r\ncorundum; and a qualitative analysis of this sample and \"box No.\r\n7\" yielded quartz, carbonate of lime, alumina, and oxide of iron.\r\n\r\n[EN#12] The italics are mine. Mr. Mathey remarks of the specimen\r\ncontaining 48 grains of gold per ton, \"It would be worthless in\r\nits present condition; if however, it could be enriched by proper\r\nwashing and dressing, and the cost in labour, etc., be not too\r\ngreat, it might be made to give fair returns.\"\r\n\r\n[EN#13] \"Little health\" at Cairo prevented my choosing the\r\ninstruments; and the result was that at last I had to depend upon\r\nmy pocket-set by Casella. Even this excellent maker's maxima and\r\nminima failed to stand the camel-jolting. The barometer, lent by\r\nthe Chief of Staff (Elliott Brothers, 24), contained amalgam, not\r\nmercury. The patent messrad, or odometer (Wittmann, Wien), with\r\nits works of soft brass instead of steel, was fit only to measure\r\na drawing-room carpet. M. Ebner sold us, at the highest prices,\r\nabsolutely useless maxima and minima, plus a baromètre aneroide,\r\nwhose chain was unhooked when it left the box. M. Sussmann, of\r\nthe Muski, supplied, for fifty francs, a good and useful\r\nmicroscope magnifying seventy-five times. The watches from M.\r\nMeyer (\"Dent and Co.!\") were cheap and nasty Swiss articles; but\r\nthey were also subjected to terrible treatment:--I once saw the\r\nwearers opening them with table-knives. Fortunately M. Lacaze,\r\nthe artist, had a good practical knowledge of instruments; and\r\nthis did us many a good turn.\r\n\r\n[EN#14] For Arabian travel I should advise aconite, instead of\r\nDover's powder; Cockle's pills, in lieu of blue mass; Warburg's\r\nDrops, in addition to quinine; pyretic saline and Karlsbad,\r\nbesides Epsom salts; and chloral, together with chlorodyne. \"Pain\r\nKiller\" is useful amongst wild people, and Oxley's ginger, with\r\nthe simple root, is equally prized. A little borax serves for\r\neye-water and alum for sore mouth. I need not mention special\r\nmedicines like the liqueur Laville, and the invaluable Waldöl\r\n(oil of the maritime pine), which each traveller must choose for\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n[EN#15] It is Lane's \"Kiyakh, vulgó Kiyák,\" and Michell's \"Kyhak,\r\nthe ancient Khoiak,\" or fourth month. The Copts begin their solar\r\nyear on our September 10-11; and date from the 2nd of Diocletian,\r\nor the Era of the \"Martyrs\" (A.D. 284). It is the old Sothic, or\r\nannus quadratus, which became the Alexandrine under the\r\nPtolemies; and which Sosigenes, the Egyptian, converted into the\r\nJulian, by assuming the Urbs condita as a point de départ, and by\r\ntransferring New Year's Day from the equinox to the solstice.\r\n\r\nThus Kayhák I, 1594, would correspond with December 9, A.D. 1877,\r\nand with Zúl-Hijjah 4, A.H. 1294. On the evening of Kayhák 14\r\n(December 22nd) winter is supposed to set in. The fifth month,\r\nTubá--Lane's \"Toobeh,\" and Michell's \"Toubeh, the ancient\r\nTobi\"--is the coldest of the year at Suez, on the isthmus and in\r\nthe adjacent parts of Arabia; rigorous weather generally lasts\r\nfrom January 20th to February 20th. In Amshír, about early March,\r\ntorrents of rain are expected to fall for a few hours. The people\r\nsay of it, in their rhyming way, Amshír, Za'bíb\r\nel-kathir--\"Amshír hath many a blast;\" and\r\n\r\n          \"Amshir\r\n     Yakul li'l-Zará 'Sir!\r\n     Wa yalhak bi'l-tawi'l el-kasi'r.\"'\r\n\r\n\"Amshír saith to the plants, 'Go (forth), and the little shall\r\nreach the big.\"' It is divided into three 'Asharát or tens--1.\r\n'Asharat el-'Ajúz (\"of the old man\"), from the cold and killing\r\nwind El-Husúm; 2. 'Asharat el-'Anzah (\"of the she-goat\"), from\r\nthe blasts and gales; and 3. 'Asharat el-Rá'í' (\"of the\r\nshepherd\"), from its change to genial warmth. Concerning Barmahát\r\n(vulgó Barambát), of old Phamenoth (seventh month), the popular\r\njingle is, Ruh el-Ghayt wa hát--\"Go to the field and bring (what\r\nit yields);\" this being the month of flowers, when the world is\r\ngreen. Barmúdah (Pharmuthi)! dukh bi'l-'amúdah (\"April! pound\r\nwith the pestle!\") alludes to the ripening of the spring crops;\r\nand so forth almost ad infinitum. For more information see the\r\n\"Egyptian Calendar,\" etc. (Alexandria: Mourès, 1878), a valuable\r\ncompilation by our friend Mr. Roland L. N. Michell, who will, let\r\nus hope, prefix his name to a future edition, enlarged and\r\nenriched with more copious quotations from the weather-rhymes and\r\nthe folk-lore of Egypt.\r\n\r\n[EN#16] This is a most interesting feature. According to Forskâl\r\n(Descriptiones xxix.), \"Suénsia litora, a recedente mari serius\r\norta, nesciunt corallia;\" and he makes the submaritime\r\n\"Cryptogama regio animalis\" begin at Tor (Raitha) and extend to\r\n(Gonfoda). Near Suez is the Newport Shoal, which could be sailed\r\nover with impunity twenty years ago, and which is now dangerous:\r\nit resembles, in fact, the other reef at the entrance of the\r\nGulf, where tile soundings have changed, in late years, from 7-7\r\n1/2 fathoms to 3-3 1/2. Geologists differ as to the\r\ncause--elevation or accretion by current-borne drift.\r\n\r\n[EN#17] In Chap. XIV, we will return to this subject.\r\n\r\n[EN#18] \"The Gold-Mines of Midian,\" etc. (London: C. Kegan Paul &\r\nCo., 1878).\r\n\r\n[EN#19] Assuming the sovereign at 97 piastres 40 parahs, this\r\nhire would be in round numbers one and two shillings; the\r\nshilling being exactly 4 piastres 24 parahs. See Chap. VII. for\r\nfurther details.\r\n\r\n[EN#20] Besides a popular account of the stages in \"The Gold\r\nMines of Midian,\" a geographical itinerary has been offered to\r\nthe Journal of the Royal Geographical Society.\r\n\r\n[EN#21] They were, perhaps, a trifle too long for small beasts:\r\nseventy-seven centimètres (better seventy); and too deep, sixty,\r\ninstead of fifty-eight. The width (forty-six) was all right. The\r\nbest were painted, and defended from wet by an upper plate of\r\nzinc; the angles and the bottoms were strengthened with iron\r\nbands in pairs; and they were closed with hasps. At each end was\r\na small block, carrying a strong looped rope for slinging the\r\nload to the pack-saddle; of these, duplicates should be provided.\r\nIn order to defend our delicate apparatus from excessive shaking,\r\nwe divided the inside, by battens, into several compartments. The\r\nsmaller cases of bottles and breakables should have been cut to\r\nfit into the larger, but this had been neglected at Cairo.\r\nFinally, not a single box gave way on the march: that was\r\nreserved for the Suez-Cairo Railway, and for landing at the\r\nLondon Docks.\r\n\r\n[EN#22] MM. Gastinel (Bey) and Marie give it per cent.:--\r\n\r\nTitaniferous iron . . . .. . . . . . . 86.50\r\nSilica . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 10.10\r\nCopper . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . . 3.40 (2 1/2 per cent.)\r\nSilver . . . . . . . . .  . . . . . . 100.0\r\n\r\n[EN#23] Hence, evidently, the derivation of the \"Marwah\" hill\r\nnear Meccah, and the famous \"Marwah\" gold mine which we shall\r\nvisit in South Midian. The Arabs here use Jebel el-Mará and Jebel\r\nel-Abyaz (plur. Jibál el-Bayzá) synonymously.\r\n\r\n[EN#24] Spon: London, 1875. A book opening a new epoch, and duly\r\nneglected.\r\n\r\n[EN#25] So said the engineer. He relied chiefly upon M. Amedée\r\nBurat, p. 229, \"Géologic Appliquáe\" (Paris: Garnier, 1870), who\r\nquotes the compte rendu of M. Guillemin, C.E. to the Exposition\r\nof 1867. The latter gentleman, who probably did not, like the\r\nformer, place Mexico in South America, makes the metalliferous\r\nlands measure four-fifths of the total surface. I am much\r\nmistaken if the same is not the case with Midian.\r\n\r\n[EN#26] In \"The Gold-Mines of Midian,\" p. 171, I erroneously\r\nasserted that the Beden does not extend to these mountains. The\r\nsecond Expedition could learn nothing about the stag with large\r\nbranches vaguely spoken of by the Bedawin.\r\n\r\n[EN#27] When \"miles\" are given, I mean the statute of 1760 yards\r\nas opposed to the geographical; the latter equals 1 minute (of a\r\ndegree) = 1 Italian or Arab = 1/4 German = 1 1/4 Roman = 10\r\nstadia.\r\n\r\n[EN#28] Were I a wealthy man, nothing would delight me more than\r\nto introduce London to La Zarzuela, the Spanish and Portuguese\r\nopera bouffe. Sir Julius Benedict tells me that it has reached\r\nParis.\r\n\r\n[EN#29] See Le Pionnier, Chemin de Fer Abyssinien d'apré's les\r\ndesseins de M. J. L. Haddan. Another valuable form is \"The\r\nEconomical\" (Mr. Russell Shaw).\r\n\r\n[EN#30] Chloritic slate is the matrix of gold in the Brazil and\r\nin Upper Styria.\r\n\r\n[EN#31] Chap. IX.\r\n\r\n[EN#32] Not Tayyibat Ism, as I wrongly wrote in \"The Gold Mines\r\nof Midian,\" misled by the Hydrographic Chart. None of the Bedawin\r\ncould explain the origin of the flattering title.\r\n\r\n[EN#33] \"The Gold-Mines of Midian.\" Chap. XII.\r\n\r\n[EN#34] The so-called Oriental, stalactitic, or variegated\r\nalabaster of Upper Egypt was nowhere hit upon.\r\n\r\n[EN#35] The Ptolemeian parallel is nearly right; the place must\r\nnot be confounded with Modi'ana or Modouna (ibid.), a\r\ncoast-settlement in north lat. 27 degrees 45', between Onne and\r\nthe Hippos Mons, Monte Cavallo.\r\n\r\n[EN#36] I have no wish to criticize my able predecessor. His map,\r\nall things considered, is a marvel of accuracy; and the high\r\npraise of Wellsted (ii. 148) only does it justice.\r\n\r\n[EN#37] The \"Muttali\" (high town) when small is termed a Burj,\r\npyrgos, tower, Pergamus (?)\r\n\r\n[EN#38] The Masháb or \"camel-stick\" of all Arabia is that\r\ncarried by the Osiris (mummy), and its crook is originally the\r\njackal-headed Anubis.\r\n\r\n[EN#39] The collection has been submitted to Mr. R. Stanley\r\nPoole, who kindly offered them for inspection to the Numismatic\r\nSociety of London (Nov. 21, 1878).\r\n\r\n[EN#40] \"Ægypten,\" etc., p. 269, et seq.\r\n\r\n[EN#41] \"Les Inscriptions des Mines d'Or,\" etc. Paris, 1862.\r\n\r\n[EN#42] In Tafel viii.

Dr. Badger tells me that he looked through his Jarídat\r\nel-'Ajáib, wa Farídat el-Gharáib, by Siráj el-Din Umar ibn\r\nel-Wardí, A.H. 940 (= A.D. 1533--1534), where he expected to\r\nfind, but did not find, notices of Madyan.\r\n\r\n[EN#45] Geschichte Ægyptens unter den Pharaonen. Nach den\r\nDenkmählern bearbeitet, von Dr. Heinrich Brugsch-Bey. Erste\r\ndeutsche Ausgabe. Leipzig: Hinrichs'sche Buchhandlung, 1877.\r\nAlready the Première Partie had appeared in French, \"Histoire\r\nd'Égypte, Introduction--Histoire des Dynasties i.--xvii.;\"\r\npublished by the same house with a second edition in 1875. An\r\nEnglish translation of this most valuable compendium, whose\r\nGerman is of the hardest, is now being printed in London.\r\n\r\n[EN#46] Pun, or Punt, the region on both sides of the Red\r\nSeamouth, including El-Yemen and Cape Guardafui, was made holy by\r\nthe birth of Osiris, Isis, and Horus. Dr. Brugsch-Bey shows that\r\none of the titles of the he-god was Bass, the cat or the leopard\r\n(whence our \"Puss\"); whilst his wife, Bast (the bissat or\r\ntabby-cat of modern Arabic), gave her name to Bubastis (Pi-Bast,\r\nthe city of Bast). From the Osiric term (Bass) the learned\r\nEgyptologist would derive Bacchus and his priests, the Bacchoi\r\nand the Bacchantes, whose dress was the leopard's skin. Could\r\nOsiris have belonged to the race whose degenerate descendants are\r\nthe murderous Somal of modern days?\r\n\r\n[EN#47] Vulg. Snefrou, \"he who makes it good;\" the ninth of the\r\nthird Dynasty; the twenty-fourth successor of Mena (Menes) in the\r\npapyri, and the twenty-sixth according to Manetho the priest. He\r\nconquered the \"Mafka-land,\" as the Sinaitic Peninsula was then\r\ncalled; and Wady Maghárah still shows his statue, habited in\r\nwarrior garb, with the proud inscription, \"Vanquisher of Stranger\r\nRaces.\" This campaign lends some colour to my suspicion that\r\nSináfir Island, at the mouth of the Gulf el-'Akabah, may preserve\r\nhis name.\r\n\r\n[EN#48] The German Türkis, and the English and French Turquoise,\r\nare both evidently derived from Gemma Turcica, Western Turkistan\r\nbeing considered tile source of the finest stones.\r\n\r\n[EN#49] The accompanying lithograph gives a list of the letters\r\nand the syllabic signs which occur in the inscription. {not\r\nincluded in this e-text}\r\n\r\n[EN#50] The article \"Ná\" is emphatic, the with the sense of that\r\nor those.\r\n\r\n[EN#51] \"Khomet\" signifies, 1. Copper, 2. Metal generally, as\r\nargent, etc.\r\n\r\n[EN#52] \"Mensh\" is always applied to sea-going ships, as opposed\r\nto Bari, Uáu, Kerer, etc., riverine craft.\r\n\r\n[EN#53] \"Kemi\" signifies, 1. Found, 2. Found out, discovered.\r\n\r\n[EN#54] That is, the royal pavilion at Thebes.\r\n\r\n[EN#55] The word \"Deb\" (brick) still survives in the Arabic Tob,\r\nand, perverted to the Iberian Adobe (Et-tob) it has travelled to\r\nMexico.\r\n\r\n[EN#56] \"Hefennu,\" as is shown by the ideograph to the right over\r\nthe three perpendiculars denoting plurality, may be either a frog\r\nor a lakh (one hundred thousand).\r\n\r\n[EN#57] The Egyptians divided gold into four qualities--1, 2, 3,\r\nand two-thirds. But it is not known whether No. 1 was the best,\r\nand we can only guess that two-thirds alluded to some alloy.\r\n\r\n[EN#58] The same as the Shu'ayb of my pages.\r\n\r\n[EN#59] For a notice of \"Moses' Well,\" now quite forgotten by the\r\nArabs, see Chapter VI.\r\n\r\n[EN#60] For an account of these diggings, see \"The Gold-Mines of\r\nMidian,\" Chap. IX.\r\n\r\n[EN#61] This strange legend will be found copied into many\r\nsubsequent authors.\r\n\r\n[EN#62] El-Abjad, the oldest existing form of the Arabic\r\nalphabet; to judge from its being identical with the Hebrew. It\r\nis supposed to date from after the beginning of the Christian\r\nera, when the Himyaritic form fell into disuse, and it is now\r\nused in chronograms only.\r\n\r\n[EN#63] L'auteur est doublement inexact en avanc, ant que\r\nl'Aboudjed se compose de vingt-quatre lettres seulement, d'abord\r\nparce que les six mots qu'il énumère ne renferment que vingt-deux\r\nlettres, et en second lieu, parce qu'il oublie de citer les deux\r\nderniers mots techniques, <Arabic> et <Arabic>, lesquels\r\ncomplétent les vingt-huit lettres prises comme valeurs\r\nnume'riques (\"Voyez l'Exposé des signes de numération chez les\r\nOrientaux,\" par M. Pihan, p. 199 et suiv.). To this I may add\r\nthat the French translators have sadly corrupted the words which\r\nshould be Abjad, Hawwaz, Hutti, Kalaman, Sa'fas, and Karashat;\r\nwhilst Sakhiz and Zuzigh are not found in the Hebrew and cognate\r\ndialects.\r\n\r\n[EN#64] The \"Gate of Lamentation,\" vulgarly and most erroneously\r\nwritten, \"Babelmandel.\"\r\n\r\n[EN#65] That is, \"spoiled,\" dry; instead of \"honoured,\"\r\nrespected. The difference of the words is in the \"pointing\" of\r\nthe third letter, and the change of m and l.\r\n\r\n[EN#66] Not to be confounded with a cosmography of the same name\r\nby Ahmed ibn Yahyá el-Shá'ir. Cf. Journal of the Royal\r\nGeographical Society, vol. xx. of 1850, p. 343.\r\n\r\n[EN#67] This route, from Suez to El-'Akabah, probably one of the\r\noldest in this world, has been traversed perfunctorily by\r\nBurckhardt and by Beke. It still wants a detailed survey, and\r\neven hieroglyphic inscriptions may be expected. Beke's map marks\r\nHawáwit (\"ruins\") near one of his nighting-places, but apparently\r\nthe remains were not visited.\r\n\r\n[EN#68] The Syrian Hajj no longer pass through El-'Akabah to\r\nMakná, but inland or eastward of it. The reason is made evident\r\nin Chap. VII.\r\n\r\n[EN#69] Thus the Khálú or Khárú of the old Egyptians, meaning a\r\n\"mixed multitude,\" were originally Phoenicians and domiciled from\r\nearliest ages about Lake Menzálah. So the \"mixed multitude,\" or\r\nmingled people, which followed Israel from Egypt would be a\r\nriff-raff of strangers. D'Herbelot says (sub voce Midian):\r\n\"Quoyque les Madianites soient reputez pour Arabes, neanmoins ils\r\nne sont pas du nombre des Tribus qui partageoient l'Arabie, et\r\ndont les Auteurs nous ont rendu un compte exact dans leur\r\nHistoire et dans leurs Genealogies; de sorte qu'il passe pour un\r\npeuple étranger qui s'est établi parmi eux.\" Yet, as we have seen\r\nby the foregoing extracts, Madyan was reckoned within the\r\nterritory of El-Medi'nah, i.e. the Hejaz.\r\n\r\nCaussin de Perceval (\"Essai sur l'Histoire des Arabs avant\r\nl'Islamisme\") regards the old Midianites as one of the \"Races\r\néteintes;\" and he makes them (vol. i. p. 23) descendants of\r\nCéthura, Abraham's second wife. In vol. ii. p. 232, he brings the\r\nBanu-Djodha'm (Juzám) from El-Yemen, and settles them in the\r\ncountry of the ancient Midianites. He adds: \"La region sur\r\nlaquelle ils étaient répandus avec leurs frères les Benou-Lakhm,\r\net, je crois aussi, avec les families Codhaites, de Bali (Baliyy)\r\net de Cayn, touchait par l'ouest à la Mer Rouge, par le nord au\r\npays que les Romains appelaient troisième Palestine, par le sud\r\naux déserts . . . par l'est, enfin, au territoire de\r\nDaumat-Djandal sur laquelle campaient les Benou-Kelb, tribu\r\nCodhaïte, alors Chrétienne, et alliée ou sujette des Romains.\" In\r\nvol. iii. p. 159, he recounts from the Táríkh el-Khamísí, and the\r\nSírat el-Rasúl, how Zayd made an expedition against the \"Djodhám\r\n(Juzám) established at Madyan on the coast of the Red Sea.\" The\r\nwarrior captured a number of women and children who were exposed\r\nfor sale, but the \"Prophet,\" hearing the wails of the mothers,\r\nordered that the young ones should not be sold apart from the\r\nparents.\r\n\r\n[EN#70] The \"Burd,\" or \"Burdah,\" was worn by Mohammed, as we know\r\nfrom a celebrated poem, for which see D'Herbelot, sub voce\r\n\"Bordah.\"\r\n\r\n[EN#71] Michaud (\"Hist. des Croisades,\" ii. 27) says: \"Une fois\r\nqu'il (Saladin) fût maitre de la capitale (Damascus); son armée\r\nvictorieuse et l'or pur appelé Obreysum (Ubraysun ou Hubraysum)\r\nqu'il tirait de l'E'gypte, lui soumirent les autres cités de la\r\nSyrie.\" The question is whether this gold was not from Midian: my\r\nfriend Yacoub Artin Bey, who supplied me with the quotation,\r\nthinks that it was.\r\n\r\n[EN#72] The most curious form, perhaps, which the ancient\r\nMidianitic tradition has assumed, was in the thirteenth century,\r\nwhen the Russians believed that the Tartars, \"with their\r\nfour-cornered faces,\" were the ancient Midianites coming in the\r\nlatter days to conquer the world. Lieutenant C. R. Conder, R.E.\r\n(\"Tentwork in Palestine,\" Bentley, 1878), has done his best to\r\nrival this style of ethnology by declaring that \"the hosts of\r\nMidian\" were, no doubt, the ancestors of the modern Bedawin.\r\n\r\n[EN#73] Alluding to the legend that the shepherds, after watering\r\ntheir flocks, rolled a great stone over the mouth of the well, so\r\nthat the contents might not be used by Jethro's daughters. Musá\r\nwaxed wroth, and, weak as he was with travel, gave the stone such\r\na kick that it went flying full forty cubits from the spot. See\r\n\"Desert of the Exodus,\" Appendix, p. 539.\r\n\r\n[EN#74] A name now unknown to the Bedawin of Madyan. The\r\nculminating peak is now supposed to be either the Shárr, the\r\nJebel el-Lauz, or the Jebel Zánah.\r\n\r\n[EN#75] The Badais of Ptolemy, which we shall presently visit.\r\n\r\n[EN#76] A large ruin east of Zibá, also visited.\r\n\r\n[EN#77] For a notice of El-Khalasah, also called El-Khulusah,\r\nEl-Khulsah, or Zu'l-Khalasah, consult the art. \"Midian,\" Smith's\r\n\"Dict. of the Bible,\" by E. S. Poole, vol. ii. p. 356. For the\r\nKhalasah of the Negeb, \"where Venus was worshipped with all the\r\nlicentious pomp of the Pagan ritual,\" see Professor Palmer's\r\n\"Desert of the Exodus,\" p. 385. The text, however, alludes to a\r\nruin called El-Khulasah, one march from El-Muwaylah to the east\r\n(Chap. VIII.).\r\n\r\n[EN#78] El-Mederah is possibly Hasíyat el-Madrá, which, like\r\nEl-A'waj, El-Bírayn, and Ma'ín, is now included in Syria.\r\nEl-Mu'allak may be Jebel Yalak,--at least, so say the Bedawin.\r\n\r\n[EN#79] In the last remark, also found in El-Kazwíní, the Madyan\r\nof El-Shu'ayb is referred to the district of Tiberias. Thus it\r\nwould belong to Syria, whilst the majority of geographers refer\r\nit to the Hejaz, and a minority to El-Yemen.\r\n\r\n[EN#80] Alluded to in a note to p. 331 of \"The Gold Mines of\r\nMidian,\" etc.\r\n\r\n[EN#81] This means only according to Hebrew and Arabic tradition,\r\nneither of them being, in this case, of much value. As I remarked\r\nbefore (\"The Gold-Mines of Midian,\" p. 177), the hieroglyphic\r\nname of the land is Mádí, in the plural Mádí-án or Mádí-ná; on\r\nthe other hand, we have no information concerning the origin and\r\nderivation of Mádí, except that it is not Egyptian.\r\n\r\n[EN#82] None of the tribes or families now inhabiting Midian\r\nrepresent the ancient Midianites; and all speak the vulgar\r\nhalf-Fellah Arabic, without any difference of accent or\r\nvocabulary from their neighbours.\r\n\r\n[EN#83] See the preceding notes on El-Makrízi.\r\n\r\n[EN#84] The Ma'ázah spoke of Kanátir (arches, i.e. aqueducts) and\r\nBibán (doors or catacombs).\r\n\r\n[EN#85] I inquired in vain concerning the ruins near Sharm\r\nBurayttah, south of Yambú' in the Harb country. Wellsted, who\r\nvisited the site (11. xi.), conjectures them to be Niebuhr's\r\n\"El-Jár.\" He makes that near the point \"as large as Yembo,\r\nextending about a mile in length, and half that space in breadth,\r\nwith a square fort in the vicinity, the remains of which have\r\ntowers at the corners and gates.\" Near the middle on either side,\r\nthe tall walls are six feet thick, strong enough where artillery\r\nis unknown. At the landing-place are a quay paved with large hewn\r\nstones, and a jetty of solid masonry in ruins. The sailors dug\r\nand found only shapeless fragments of corroded copper and brass;\r\ncoloured glass, as usual more opaque than the modern, and\r\nearthenware of the kind scattered about Egyptian ruins. About one\r\nmile from the fort were other remains, built of coral, now much\r\nblackened by exposure; and similar constructions on the further\r\nside of the Sharm could not be examined, as the Harb Bedawin were\r\njealous and hostile.\r\n\r\n[EN#86] The name is from Gen. xx. 1, and it signifies the country\r\nlying to the south of Palestine. See \"The Negeb,\" by the late\r\nRev. E. Wilton (London, 1863), and vol. ii. \"The Desert of the\r\nExodus,\" so often alluded to in these pages.\r\n\r\n[EN#87] \"The Gold-Mines of Midian,\" Chap. IX.\r\n\r\n[EN#88] Kúfah <Arabic> or <Arabic> in Persian means a basket or\r\na coffin.\r\n\r\n[EN#89] Roaring when the rider mounts, halts, or dismounts, is\r\nconsidered a proof of snobbish blood among the Bisha'ri'n: for\r\nsome months the camel-colt is generally muzzled on such occasions\r\ntill it learns the sterling worth of silence.\r\n\r\nFor an admirable description, far too detailed to place before\r\nthe general public, of the likeness and the difference between\r\nthe dromedary of the Bishárín and the Númaní and Maskatí, the\r\npurest blood of the Arabs, see pp. 145--154, \"L' Etbaye, etc.,\r\nMines d Or,\" by my old friend Linant de Bellefonds Bey, now\r\nSulayman Pasha. Paris: Arthus Bertrand (no date).\r\n\r\n[EN#90] The contents worked into shape by Mr. William J. Turner,\r\nof the Royal Geographical Society, appear in the Appendix.\r\n\r\n[EN#91] \"Desert of the Exodus,\" p. 347.\r\n\r\n[EN#92] \"The Gold-Mines of Midian,\" Chap. VI.\r\n\r\n[EN#93] In \"The Gold-Mines of Midian\" (passim) this \"Spring of\r\nthe She-Cook\" appeared as the \"She-Cork!\"\r\n\r\n[EN#94] A region to the north-west of 'Aynúnah, afterwards\r\nvisited by Lieutenant Yusuf. See Chap. IX.\r\n\r\n[EN#95] Such an act would disgrace an Arab tribe, and of course\r\nit is denied by the Beni 'Ukbah. We visited this valley, which is\r\none of the influents of the Wady 'Aynúnah, during the first\r\nExpedition (\"The Gold-Mines of Midian,\" p. 165).\r\n\r\n[EN#96] The modern Beni 'Ukbah ignore the story of Abú Rísh, not\r\nwishing to confess their obligations to the Huwaytát.\r\n\r\n[EN#97] The tomb on the hillock north of El-Muwaylah.\r\n\r\n[EN#98] South-east of EI-Muwaylah.\r\n\r\n[EN#99] These hard conditions were actually renewed some\r\ntwenty-five years ago.\r\n\r\n[EN#100] For ample notices on this subject, see \"The Gold-Mines\r\nof Midian,\" Chap. XII. In p. 337, however, I made the mistake of\r\nsupposing Makná to be the capital, instead of the port of the\r\ncapital. The true position is north lat. 28 degrees 24'.\r\n\r\n[EN#101] For historical notices of the diamond in North-Western\r\nArabia, see \"The Gold-Mines of Midian,\" p. 168.\r\n\r\n[EN#102] Dr. Beke's artist made a plan of this rude affair (p.\r\n349), and nothing can be worse. The Egyptian Staff-officers drew\r\nthe ruin correctly; but the poor remains by no means deserve the\r\nhonour of a wood-cut.\r\n\r\n[EN#103]. The word is corrupted from Jamb, \"the side,\" alluding\r\nto the animal's gait; we did not find the true lobster (Homarus\r\nvulgaris), the astica of the Adriatic, whose northern waters\r\nproduce such noble specimens.\r\n\r\n[EN#104] The spirit-tins, prepared for me at Trieste, were as\r\nmost things there are, very dear and very bad; after a short use\r\nthey became full of holes. So the bowie-knives, expressly made to\r\norder at old Tergeste, proved to be of iron not of steel.\r\n\r\n[EN#105] \"Travels,\" Vol. II. Chap. IV.\r\n\r\n[EN#106] Confirmed by Dr. Beke, p. 533.\r\n\r\n[EN#107] P. 351.\r\n\r\n[EN#108] I am doubtful about this name, which the Bedawi apply to\r\nmore than one place.\r\n\r\n[EN#109] Strictly speaking, the dust of the Nevada country was\r\noxide of silver.\r\n\r\n[EN#110] M. Burat (\"Géologie Appliqée,\" i. 8) gives the following\r\nminima proportions in which metal may be worked on a grand scale,\r\nof course under the most favourable circumstances. The extremes\r\nare 0.25 (iron), and 0.00001 (gold); and antimony, bismuth,\r\ncobalt, and nickel are neglected, because the proportions vary so\r\nmuch.\r\n\r\n          Iron,               0.25\r\n          Zinc,               0.20\r\n          Lead,               0.02 (two per cent.)\r\n          Copper and mercury,      0.01\r\n          Tin,                0.005 (1/2 per cent.)\r\n          Silver,        0.0005 (1/2 per 1000)\r\n          Gold,               0.00001 (1/100,000)\r\n\r\nThis table is recommended to the many \"profane\" who do not\r\nbelieve a rock to be auriferous or argentiferous, unless they can\r\nsee the gold and silver with the naked eye.\r\n\r\n[EN#111] The button, when assayed by the official mining office\r\nat Trieste, was pronounced to be antimony! It was extracted from\r\nruddle (red ochre) and limonite (brown ochre or hydrous oxide of\r\niron): both are sesquioxides (Fe2O3) which become dark when\r\nheated and change to magnetic oxide (Fe3O4). M. Marie is probably\r\nthe first who ever \"ran down\" iron oxide with lead. No wonder\r\nthat Colonel Ross pronounced his culot a marvellous alloy.\r\n\r\n[EN#112] Kárún was a pauper cousin of Musá, who had learned\r\nalchemy from Kulsum, the Lawgiver's sister. The keys of his\r\ntreasure loaded forty mules; and his palace had doors and roof of\r\nfine gold. As he waxed fat he kicked against his chief, who as\r\nusual became exceeding wroth, and prayed that the earth might\r\nswallow him.\r\n\r\n[EN#113] Pp. 337--339.\r\n\r\n[EN#114] \"Tasbíh\" literally means uttering Subhán Allah!--\"Praise\r\nbe to Allah!\"\r\n\r\n[EN#115] It is curious how this goddess has extended, through the\r\nDalmatian \"Fortunale\" and the Slav \"Fortunja\" of the Bosnian\r\npeasants, to Turkey, Egypt, and even Arabia. Applied to a violent\r\nstorm, perhaps it is a euphuism for the Latin word in the sense\r\nof good sign or omen; so in Propertius--\"Nulla ne placatæ veniet\r\nfortuna procellæ.\"\r\n\r\n[EN#116] P. 341.\r\n\r\n[EN#117] The singular is Maknáwi, pronounced Magnáwi.\r\n\r\n[EN#118] Loc. cit. p. 79.\r\n\r\n[EN#119] The passage was brought to my notice by my excellent\r\nfriend, Mr. James Pincherle of Trieste. In the \"Atlante Storico e\r\nGeografico della Terra Santa, esposto in 14 Tavole e 14 Quadri\r\nstorici della Palestina,\" republished (without date) by Francesco\r\nPagnoni of Milan, appears an annexed commentary by Cornelius à\r\nLapide. The latter, Cornelius Van den Steen (Corneille de la\r\nPierre), born near Liege, a learned Jesuit, profound theologian,\r\nand accomplished historian, was famous as a Hebraist and lecturer\r\non Holy Writ. He died at Rome March 12, 1637; and a collected\r\nedition of his works in sixteen volumes, folio, appeared at\r\nVenice in 1711, and at Lyons in 1732. It is related of him that,\r\nbeing called to preach in the presence of the Pope, he began his\r\nsermon on his knees. The Holy Father commanded him to rise, and\r\nhe obeyed; but his stature was so short that he appeared to be\r\nstill kneeling. The order was reiterated; whereupon Zacchaeus,\r\nunderstanding its cause, said modestly, \"Beatissime Pater, ipse\r\nfecit nos, et non ipsi nos.\"\r\n\r\n[EN#120] The name and other points connected with it have been\r\nnoticed in \"The Gold-Mines of Midian,\" p. 338.\r\n\r\n[EN#121] See \"The Gold-Mines of Midian,\" p. 338.\r\n\r\n[EN#122] \"Travels in Syria, etc.,\" p. 524.\r\n\r\n[EN#123] In \"The Gold-Mines of Midian,\" p. 338, this name became,\r\nby virtue of the author's cacography, \"Beoche.\"\r\n\r\n[EN#124] \"Diario in Arabia Petrea\" (1865) di Visconte Giammartino\r\nArconati. Roma, 1872.\r\n\r\n[EN#125] Wellsted, ii. 143.\r\n\r\n[EN#126] \"Ghor\" is the whole depression including the Jordan and\r\nthe Dead Sea, while El-'Akabah is its southernmost section. In\r\nolder maps this gulf is made to fork at the north--a\r\ntopographical absurdity. I have also fallen into a notable\r\nblunder about the Jebel el-Shará', in \"The Gold-Mines of Midian,\"\r\nnote ?, p. 175.\r\n\r\n[EN#127] See Appendix, p. 537, \"Geological Notes,\" etc., in Dr.\r\nBeke's \"Sinai in Arabia.\"\r\n\r\n[EN#128] See \"The Gold-Mines of Midian,\" pp. 338, 339.\r\n\r\n[EN#129] This Yitm, which Burckhardt first wrote El-Ithem,\r\nunfortunately gave Dr. Beke an opportunity of finding, in his\r\n\"Wady el-Ithem,\" the \"Etham of the Exodus.\" (See \"The\r\nGold-Mines of Midian,\" pp. 359--361). The latter has been\r\nconclusively shown by Brugsch-Bey in his lecture, \"La Sortie des\r\nHébreux d'E'gypte\" (Alexandrie: Mourès, 1874), p. 31, to be the\r\ngreat fort of Khatom, on the highway to Phoenicia. The roots\r\nKhatam, Asham, Tam, like the Arabic \"Khatm\" (<Arabic>) signify to\r\nseal up, close; and thus Khatom in Egyptian, as Atham, Etham in\r\nHebrew, means a closed place, a fortress. Wallin calls the\r\n\"Yitm,\" which he never visited, \"Wâdî Lithm, a cross valley\r\nopening through the chain at about eight hours (twenty-four\r\nmiles) north of 'Akaba'\"--possibly Lithm is a misprint, but it is\r\nrepeated in more than one page.\r\n\r\n[EN#130] Dr. Beke, who afterwards changed his mind, would\r\nidentify Hor, the burial-place of Aaron, with Horeb of the Rock\r\n(\"Orig. Biblicae,\" 195). He then adopted (\"Sinai in Arabia,\" p.\r\n77) the opinion of St. Jerome (\"De Situ,\" etc., p. 191), \"Mihi\r\nautem videtur quod duplice nomine mons nunc Sina, nunc Choreb\r\nvocatur.\" Wellsted (ii. 103) also makes Horeb synonymous with\r\n\"Wilderness of Sinai.\" Professor Palmer (118) translates Horeb by\r\n\"ground that has been drained and left dry:\" he would include in\r\nit the whole Desert of Sinai, together with \"the Mountain;\"\r\nwhilst he warns us that the monks call the whole southern portion\r\nof their mountain \"Horeb.\" Others confine \"Horeb\" to Jebel Musá,\r\nand even to its eastern shoulder.\r\n\r\n[EN#131] For the Mount or Mountain see Exodus xix. 2, 12, 20, 23;\r\nalso xxxii. 19; Deut. iv. II, and v. 23; Heb. xii. 18. Josephus\r\n(\"Antiq.,\" II. ii. I) speaks of it similarly as a \"mountain,\" and\r\ndescribes it with all the apparatus of fable; while his\r\ncompatriot and contemporary, St. Paul (Epist. to the Galatians\r\niv. 25), calls it only \"Mount Sinai in Arabia,\" i.e. east of\r\nJordan.\r\n\r\n[EN#132] See Athenaeum, February 8th and 15th, 1873.\r\n\r\n[EN#133] They were heard of by Burckhardt (\"Syria,\" p. 510).\r\n\r\n[EN#134] Beke (p. 446), on February 6th, estimated the rise of\r\nthe tide at 'Akabah head to be three to four feet. This is\r\ngreatly in excess of actuality; but, then, he was finding out\r\nsome rational way of drowning \"Pharaoh and his host.\"\r\n\r\n[EN#135] Those living further north, the 'Ammárín and the\r\nLiyásinah, are unmitigated scoundrels and dangerous ruffians:\r\namongst the former Shaykh Sala'mah ibn 'Awwád with his brother,\r\nand among the latter Ibrahím el-Hasanát, simply deserve hanging.\r\nIn Edom, too, 'Abd el-Rahmán el-'Awar (\"the One-eyed\"), Shaykh of\r\nthe Fellahín, is \"wanted;\" and the 'Alawín-Huwaytát would be\r\ngreatly improved were they to be placed under Egyptian, instead\r\nof Syrian, rule.\r\n\r\n[EN#136] Dr. Beke's artist (p. 374) has produced a work of\r\nimagination, especially in the foreground and background of his\r\n\"Migdol or Castle of Akaba.\"\r\n\r\n[EN#137] Commonly written Kansúh (Kansooh) and corrupted by\r\nEuropeans to Campson (like Sampson) Goree.\r\n\r\n[EN#138] Not Hámid, as some mispronounce the word.\r\n\r\n[EN#139] \"The Gold-Mines of Midian,\" Chap. XII.\r\n\r\n[EN#140] The chain did not part. The anchor was afterwards fished\r\nup by divers from El-Muwaylah, and its shank was found broken\r\nclean across like a carrot. Yet there was no sign of a flaw. Mr.\r\nDuguid calculated the transverse breaking strain of average\r\nanchor-iron (8 1/2 inches x 4 = 22 square inches), at 83 1/10\r\ntons; and the tensile breaking strain at 484 tons, or 22 tons to\r\nthe square inch; while the stud-length cable of 1 1/8 inch chain,\r\n150 fathoms long, would carry, if proof, 24 tons. Captain\r\nMohammed was persevering enough, after the divers had failed, to\r\nrecover his chain when on his cruise homewards; and the Rais of\r\nthe Sambúk was equally lucky.\r\n\r\n[EN#141] \"The Gold-Mines of Midian,\" Ch.

The first, which was accompanied by\r\nquartz, resembled the produce of Orenburg. A Peruvian\r\nmine-proprietor had pronounced it to be \"Rosicler\" silver. The\r\nmagnetic sand bore a tantalizing resemblance to the highly\r\nauriferous black sand of Ekaterinburg.\r\n\r\n[EN#144] Correspondence of the Sheffield Telegraph (May 18),\r\ncopied into the Globe of May 25, etc., etc., etc.\r\n\r\n[EN#145] \"The Gold-Mines of Midian,\" Chap.

XII.\r\n\r\n[EN#149] Let me at once protest against the assertions contained\r\nin an able review of \"The Gold-Mines of Midian\" (Pall Mall\r\nGazette, June 7, 1878). The writer makes ancient Midian extend\r\nfrom the north of the Arabic Gulf (El-'Akabah?) and Arabia Felix\r\n(which? of the classics or of the moderns?) to the plains of\r\nMoab\"--exactly where it assuredly does not now extend.\r\n\r\n[EN#150] Described in Chap. XV.\r\n\r\n[EN#151] This place is noticed in \"The Gold-Mines of Midian,\"\r\nChap. X.\r\n\r\n[EN#152] I am not certain of this name, as several variants were\r\ngiven to me. For historical notices of the ruined town of\r\nKhulasah, see Chap. IV.\r\n\r\n[EN#153] In \"The Gold-Mines of Midian,\" Chap. V., occur several\r\ndifferences of nomenclature, which may or may not be mistakes.\r\nThey are corrected in my \"Itineraries,\" part ii. sect. 2.\r\n\r\n[EN#154] To this breed belonged the beast which carried me on the\r\nfirst Expedition.\r\n\r\n[EN#155] For a short notice of this region, hitherto unvisited by\r\nEuropeans, see Chap.
