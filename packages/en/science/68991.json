These\r\nnew machines are called sometimes mechanical brains and sometimes\r\nsequence-controlled calculators and sometimes by other names.\r\nEssentially, though, they are machines that can handle information with\r\ngreat skill and great speed. And that power is very similar to the\r\npower of a brain.\r\n\r\nThese new machines are important. They do the work of hundreds of human\r\nbeings for the wages of a dozen. They are powerful instruments for\r\nobtaining new knowledge. They apply in science, business, government,\r\nand other activities. They apply in reasoning and computing, and, the\r\nharder the problem, the more useful they are. Along with the release of\r\natomic energy, they are one of the great achievements of the present\r\ncentury. No one can afford to be unaware of their significance.\r\n\r\nIn this book I have sought to tell a part of the story of these new\r\nmachines that think. Perhaps you, as you start this book, may not agree\r\nwith me that a machine can think: the first chapter of this book is\r\ndevoted to the discussion of this question.\r\n\r\nMy purpose has been to tell enough about these machines so that we\r\ncan see in general how they work. I have sought to explain some\r\ngiant brains that have been built and to show how they do thinking\r\noperations. I have sought also to talk about what these machines can do\r\nin the future and to judge their significance for us. It seems to me\r\nthat they will take a load off men’s as great as the load that printing\r\ntook off men’s writing: a tremendous burden lifted.\r\n\r\nWe need to examine several of the new mechanical brains: Massachusetts\r\nInstitute of Technology’s differential analyzer, Harvard’s IBM\r\nautomatic sequence-controlled calculator, Moore School’s ENIAC\r\n(Electronic Numerical Integrator and Calculator), and Bell Laboratories’\r\ngeneral-purpose relay calculator. These are described in the sequence in\r\nwhich they were finished between the years 1942 and 1946.\r\n\r\nWe also have to go on some excursions—for instance, the nature of\r\nlanguage and of symbols, the meaning of thinking, the human brain and\r\nnervous system, the future design of machinery that can think, and a\r\nlittle algebra and logic. I have also sought to discuss the relations\r\nbetween machines that think and human society—what we can foresee as\r\nlikely to happen or be needed as a result of the remarkable invention\r\nof machines that can think.\r\n\r\n\r\nREADING THIS BOOK\r\n\r\nThis book is intended for everyone. I have sought to put it together in\r\nsuch a way that any reader can select from it what he wants.\r\n\r\nPerhaps at first reading you want only the main thread of the story.\r\nThen read only what seems interesting, and skip whatever seems\r\nuninteresting. The subheadings should help to tell you what to read and\r\nwhat to skip. Nearly all the chapters can be read with little reference\r\nto what goes before, although some reference to the supplements in the\r\nback may at times be useful.\r\n\r\nPerhaps your memory of physics is dim, like mine. The little knowledge\r\nof physics needed is explained here and there throughout the book, and\r\nthe index should tell where to find any explanation you may want.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it is a long time since you did any algebra. Then Supplement\r\n2 on mathematics may hold something of use to you. Two sections (one\r\nin Chapter 5 and one in Chapter 6) labeled as containing some rather\r\nmathematical details may be skipped with no great loss.\r\n\r\nPerhaps you are unacquainted with logic that uses symbols—the branch of\r\nlogic called mathematical logic. In fact, very few people are familiar\r\nwith it. No discussion in the book hinges on understanding this\r\nsubject, except for Chapter 9 where a machine that calculates logical\r\ntruth is described. In all other chapters you may freely skip all\r\nreferences to mathematical logic. But, if you are curious about the\r\nsubject and how it can be usefully applied in the field of mechanical\r\nbrains, then begin with the introduction to the subject in Chapter 9,\r\nand note the suggestions in the section entitled “Algebra of Logic” in\r\nSupplement 2.\r\n\r\nIn any case, glance at the table of contents, the chapter headings and\r\nsubheadings, and the supplements at the back. These should give an idea\r\nof how the book is put together and how you may select what may be\r\ninteresting to you.\r\n\r\nPlease do not read this book straight from beginning to end unless\r\nthat way proves to be congenial to you. If you are not interested in\r\ntechnical details, skip most of the middle chapters, which describe\r\nexisting mechanical brains. If, on the other hand, you want more\r\ndetails than this book contains, look up references in Supplement\r\n3. Here are listed, with a few comments, over 250 books, articles,\r\nand pamphlets related to the subject of machinery for computing and\r\nreasoning. These cover many parts of the field; some parts, however,\r\nare not yet covered by any published information.\r\n\r\nThere are no photographs in this book, although there are over 80\r\ndrawings. Photographs of these complicated machines can really show\r\nvery little: panels, lights, switches, wires, and other kinds of\r\nhardware. What is important is the way the machine works inside. This\r\ncannot be shown by a photograph but may be shown by schematic drawings.\r\nIn the same way, a photograph of a human being shows almost nothing\r\nabout how he thinks.\r\n\r\n\r\nUNDERSTANDING THIS BOOK\r\n\r\nI have tried to write this book so that it could be understood. I have\r\nattempted to explain machinery for computing and reasoning without\r\nusing technical words any more than necessary. To do this seemed to be\r\neasy in some places, much harder in others. As a test of this attempt,\r\na count has been made of all the different words in the book that have\r\ntwo syllables or more, that are used for explaining, and that are\r\nnot themselves defined. There are fewer than 1800 of these words. In\r\nSupplement 1, entitled “Words and Ideas,” I have digressed to discuss\r\nfurther the problem of explanation and understanding.\r\n\r\nEvery now and then in the book, along comes a word or a phrase that\r\nhas a special meaning, for example, the name of something new. When it\r\nfirst appears, it is put in italics and is explained or defined. In\r\naddition, all the words and phrases having special meaning appear again\r\nin the index, and next to each is the page number of its explanation or\r\ndefinition.\r\n\r\nIn many places, I have talked of mechanical brains as if they were\r\nliving. For example, instead of “capacity to store information” I have\r\nspoken of “memory.” Of course, the machines are not living; but they do\r\nhave individuality, responsiveness, and other traits of living beings,\r\njust as a political party pictured as a living elephant does. Besides,\r\nto treat things as persons is a help in making any subject vivid and\r\nunderstandable, as every song writer and cartoonist illustrates.\r\nWe speak of “Old Man River” and “Father Time”; we may speak of a\r\nship or a locomotive as “she”; and the crew on the first Harvard\r\nsequence-controlled calculator has often called her “Bessy, the Bessel\r\nengine.”\r\n\r\nLet us pause a little longer on the subject of understanding. What\r\nis the understanding of something new? It is a state of knowing, a\r\nprocess of knowing more and more. The more we know about something\r\nnew, the better we understand it. It is possible for almost anybody to\r\nunderstand almost anything, I believe. What is mainly needed in order\r\nto grasp an idea is a good collection of true statements about it and\r\nsome practice in using those statements in situations. For example,\r\nno one has ever seen or touched the separate scraps of electricity\r\ncalled electrons. But electrons have been described and measured;\r\nhundreds of thousands of people work with electrons; they know and use\r\ntrue statements about electrons. In effect, these people understand\r\nelectrons.\r\n\r\nProbably the hardest task of an author is to make his statements\r\nunderstandable yet accurate. It is too much to hope for complete\r\nsuccess. I shall be very grateful to any reader who points out to me\r\nthe statements that he has not understood or that are in error.\r\n\r\nAs to the views I have expressed, I do not expect every reader to agree\r\nwith me. In fact, I shall be glad if many a reader disagrees with\r\nme. For then someone else may say to both of us, “You’re both right\r\nand both wrong—the truth lies atwixt and atween you.” Thoughtful and\r\ntolerant disagreement is the finest climate for scientific progress.\r\n\r\n\r\nBASIC FACTS\r\n\r\nMany of the mechanical brains described in this book will do good work\r\nfor years; but their design is already out of date. Many organizations\r\nare hard at work finding new tricks in electronics, materials, and\r\nengineering and making new mechanical brains that are better and faster.\r\n\r\nIn spite of future developments, though, the basic facts about\r\nmechanical brains will endure. These basic facts are drawn from the\r\nprinciples of thinking, of mathematics, of science, of engineering,\r\netc. These facts govern all handling of information. They do not depend\r\nvery much on human or mechanical energy. They do not depend very much\r\non signs. They do not depend very much on the century, or the language,\r\nor the country. For example, “II et III V sunt,” the Romans may have\r\nsaid; “deux et trois font cinq,” say the French; “2 + 3 = 5,” say the\r\nmathematicians; and we say, “two and three make five.” The main effort\r\nin this book has been to make clear the basic facts about mechanical\r\nbrains, for they are now a masterly instrument for obtaining new\r\nknowledge.\r\n\r\n                                    EDMUND CALLIS BERKELEY\r\n\r\n    New York 11, N.

It springs essentially\r\nfrom the desire to see human beings use their knowledge better: we\r\nknow enough, but how are we to use what we know? Machines that handle\r\ninformation, that make knowledge accessible, are a long step in the\r\ndirection of using what we know.\r\n\r\nFor help in causing this desire to come to fruition, I should like\r\nto express my indebtedness especially to Professor (then Commander,\r\nU.S.N.R.) Howard H. Aiken of Harvard University, whose stimulus, while\r\nI was stationed for ten months in 1945-46 in his laboratory, was very\r\ngreat.\r\n\r\nI should also like to express my appreciation to Mr. Harry J. Volk,\r\nwhose vision and enthusiasm greatly encouraged me in the writing of\r\nthis book.\r\n\r\nFor careful reviews and helpful comments on the chapters dealing with\r\nexisting mechanical brains, I am especially grateful to Dr. Franz\r\nL. Alt, Mr. E. G. Andrews, Professor Samuel H. Caldwell, Dr. Grace\r\nM. Hopper, Mr. Theodore A. Kalin, and Dr. John W. Mauchly, who are\r\nexperts in their fields. Dr. Ruth P. Berkeley, Dr. Rudolf Flesch, Mr.\r\nJ. Ross Macdonald, Dr. Z. I. Mosesson, Mr. Irving Rosenthal, Mr. Max\r\nS. Weinstein, and many others have been true friends in reading and\r\ncommenting upon many parts of the manuscript. Mr. Frank W. Keller\r\ndevoted much time and skill to converting my rough sketches into\r\nillustrations. Mr. Murray B. Ritterman has been of invaluable help in\r\npreparing and checking much of the bibliography. Miss Marjorie L. Black\r\nhas helped very greatly in turning scraps of paper bearing sentences\r\ninto an excellent manuscript for the printer.\r\n\r\nFor permission to use the quotations on various pages in Chapters 11\r\nand 12, I am indebted to the kindness of:\r\n\r\n    E.

They\r\ncalculate and they reason. Some of them are cleverer than others—able\r\nto do more kinds of problems. Some are extremely fast: one of them does\r\n5000 additions a second for hours or days, as may be needed. Where they\r\napply, they find answers to problems much faster and more accurately\r\nthan human beings can; and so they can solve problems that a man’s life\r\nis far too short to permit him to do. That is why they were built.\r\n\r\nThese machines are similar to what a brain would be if it were made of\r\nhardware and wire instead of flesh and nerves. It is therefore natural\r\nto call these machines _mechanical brains_. Also, since their powers\r\nare like those of a giant, we may call them _giant brains_.\r\n\r\nSeveral giant mechanical brains are now at work finding out\r\nanswers never before known. Two are in Cambridge, Mass.; one is\r\nat Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and one at Harvard\r\nUniversity. Two are in Aberdeen, Md., at the Army’s Ballistic Research\r\nLaboratories. These four machines were finished in the period 1942\r\nto 1946 and are described in later chapters of this book. More giant\r\nbrains are being constructed.\r\n\r\nCan we say that these machines really think? What do we mean by\r\nthinking, and how does the human brain think?\r\n\r\n\r\nHUMAN THINKING\r\n\r\nWe do not know very much about the physical process of thinking in the\r\nhuman brain. If you ask a scientist how flesh and blood in a human\r\nbrain can think, he will talk to you a little about nerves and about\r\nelectrical and chemical changes, but he will not be able to tell you\r\nvery much about how we add 2 and 3 and make 5. What men know about the\r\nway in which a human brain thinks can be put down in a few pages, and\r\nwhat men do not know would fill many libraries.\r\n\r\nInjuries to brains have shown some things of importance; for example,\r\nthey have shown that certain parts of the brain have certain duties.\r\nThere is a part of the brain, for instance, where sights are recorded\r\nand compared. If an accident damages the part of the brain where\r\ncertain information is stored, the human being has to relearn—haltingly\r\nand badly—the information destroyed.\r\n\r\nWe know also that thinking in the human brain is done essentially by a\r\nprocess of storing information and then referring to it, by a process\r\nof learning and remembering. We know that there are no little wheels\r\nin the brain so that a wheel standing at 2 can be turned 3 more steps\r\nand the result of 5 read. Instead, you and I store the information that\r\n2 and 3 are 5, and store it in such a way that we can give the answer\r\nwhen questioned. But we do not know the register in our brain where\r\nthis particular piece of information is stored. Nor do we know how,\r\nwhen we are questioned, we are able automatically to pick up the nerve\r\nchannels that lead into this register, get the answer, and report it.\r\n\r\nSince there are many nerves in the brain, about 10 billion of them, in\r\nfact, we are certain that the network of connecting nerves is a main\r\npart of the puzzle. We are therefore much interested in nerves and\r\ntheir properties.\r\n\r\n\r\nNERVES AND THEIR PROPERTIES\r\n\r\nA single nerve, or _nerve cell_, consists of a _cell nucleus_ and\r\na _fiber_. This fiber may have a length of anything from a small\r\nfraction of an inch up to several feet. In the laboratory, successive\r\nimpulses can be sent along a nerve fiber as often as 1000 a second.\r\nImpulses can travel along a nerve fiber in either direction at a rate\r\nfrom 3 feet to 300 feet a second. Because the speed of the impulse\r\nis far less than 186,000 miles a second—the speed of an electric\r\ncurrent—the impulse in the nerve is thought by some investigators to be\r\nmore chemical than electrical.\r\n\r\nWe know that a nerve cell has what is called an _all-or-none response_,\r\nlike the trigger of a gun. If you stimulate the nerve up to a certain\r\npoint, nothing will happen; if you reach that point, or cross\r\nit,—bang!—the nerve responds and sends out an impulse. The strength of\r\nthe impulse, like the shot of the gun, has no relation whatever to the\r\namount of the stimulation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1. Scheme of a nerve cell.]\r\n\r\nThe structure between the end of one nerve and the beginning of the\r\nnext is called a _synapse_ (see Fig. 1). No one really knows very much\r\nabout synapses, for they are extremely small and it is not easy to tell\r\nwhere a synapse stops and other stuff begins. Impulses travel through\r\nsynapses in from ½ to 3 thousandths of a second. An impulse travels\r\nthrough a synapse only in one direction, from the head (or _axon_) of\r\none nerve fiber to the foot (or _dendrite_) of another. It seems clear\r\nthat the activity in a synapse is chemical. When the head of a nerve\r\nfiber brings in an impulse to a synapse, apparently a chemical called\r\n_acetylcholine_ is released and may affect the foot of another fiber,\r\nthus transmitting the impulse; but the process and the conditions for\r\nit are still not well understood.\r\n\r\nIt is thought that nearly all information is handled in the brain\r\nby groups of nerves in parallel paths. For example, the eye is\r\nestimated to have about 100 million nerves sensitive to light, and the\r\ninformation that they gather is reported by about 1 million nerves to\r\nthe part of the brain that stores sights.\r\n\r\nNot much more is yet known, however, about the operation of handling\r\ninformation in a human brain. We do not yet know how the nerves are\r\nconnected so that we can do what we do. Probably the greatest obstacle\r\nto knowledge is that so far we cannot observe the detailed structure of\r\na living human brain while it performs, without hurting or killing it.\r\n\r\n\r\nBEHAVIOR THAT IS THINKING\r\n\r\nTherefore, we cannot yet tell what thinking is by observing precisely\r\nhow a human brain does it. Instead, we have to define thinking by\r\ndescribing the kind of behavior that we call thinking. Let us consider\r\nsome examples.\r\n\r\nWhen you and I add 12 and 8 and make 20, we are thinking. We use our\r\nminds and our understanding to count 8 places forward from 12, for\r\nexample, and finish with 20. If we could find a dog or a horse that\r\ncould add numbers and tell answers, we would certainly say that the\r\nanimal could think.\r\n\r\nWith no trouble a machine can do this. An ordinary 10-column adding\r\nmachine can be given two numbers like 1,378,917,766 and 2,355,799,867\r\nand the instruction to add them. The machine will then give the answer,\r\n3,734,717,633, much faster than a man. In fact, the mechanical brain at\r\nHarvard can add a number of 23 digits to another number of 23 digits\r\nand get the right answer in ³/₁₀ of a second.\r\n\r\nOr, suppose that you are walking along a road and come to a fork. If\r\nyou stop, read the signpost, and then choose left or right, you are\r\nthinking. You know beforehand where you want to go, you compare your\r\ndestination with what the signpost says, and you decide on your route.\r\nThis is an operation of logical choice.\r\n\r\nA machine can do this. The mechanical brain now at Aberdeen which was\r\nbuilt at Bell Laboratories can examine any number that comes up in the\r\nprocess of a calculation and tell whether it is bigger than 3 (or any\r\nstated number) or smaller. If the number is bigger than 3, the machine\r\nwill choose one process; if the number is smaller than 3, the machine\r\nwill choose another process.\r\n\r\nNow suppose that we consider the basic operation of all thinking: in\r\nthe human brain it is called learning and remembering, and in a machine\r\nit is called storing information and then referring to it. For example,\r\nsuppose you want to find 305 Main Street in Kalamazoo. You look up a\r\nmap of Kalamazoo; the map is information kindly stored by other people\r\nfor your use. When you study the map, notice the streets and the\r\nnumbering, and then find where the house should be, you are thinking.\r\n\r\nA machine can do this. In the Bell Laboratories’ mechanical brain, for\r\nexample, the map could be stored as a long list of the blocks of the\r\ncity and the streets and numbers that apply to each block. The machine\r\nwill then hunt for the city block that contains 305 Main Street and\r\nreport it when found.\r\n\r\nA machine can handle information; it can calculate, conclude, and\r\nchoose; it can perform reasonable operations with information. A\r\nmachine, therefore, can think.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DEFINITION OF A MECHANICAL BRAIN\r\n\r\nNow when we speak of a machine that thinks, or a mechanical brain, what\r\ndo we mean? Essentially, a _mechanical brain_ is a machine that handles\r\ninformation, transfers information automatically from one part of the\r\nmachine to another, and has a flexible control over the sequence of its\r\noperations. No human being is needed around such a machine to pick up\r\na physical piece of information produced in one part of the machine,\r\npersonally move it to another part of the machine, and there put it in\r\nagain. Nor is any human being needed to give the machine instructions\r\nfrom minute to minute. Instead, we can write out the whole program to\r\nsolve a problem, translate the program into machine language, and put\r\nthe program into the machine. Then we press the “start” button; the\r\nmachine starts whirring; and it prints out the answers as it obtains\r\nthem. Machines that handle information have existed for more than 2000\r\nyears. These two properties are new, however, and make a deep break\r\nwith the past.\r\n\r\nHow should we imagine a mechanical brain? One way to think of a\r\nmechanical brain is shown in Fig. 2. We see here a railroad line with\r\nfour stations, marked _input_, _storage_, _computer_, and _output_.\r\nThese stations are joined by little gates or switches to the main\r\nrailroad line. We can imagine that numbers and other information move\r\nalong this railroad line, loaded in freight cars. _Input_ and _output_\r\nare stations where numbers or other information go in and come out,\r\nrespectively. _Storage_ is a station where there are many platforms and\r\nwhere information can be stored. The _computer_ is a special station\r\nsomewhat like a factory; when two numbers are loaded on platforms 1 and\r\n2 of this station and an order is loaded on platform 3, then another\r\nnumber is produced on platform 4.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2. Scheme of a mechanical brain.]\r\n\r\nWe see also a tower, marked _control_. This tower runs a telegraph line\r\nto each of its little watchmen standing by the gates. The tower tells\r\nthem when to open and when to shut which gates.\r\n\r\nNow we can see that, just as soon as the right gates are shut, freight\r\ncars of information can move between stations. Actually the freight\r\ncars move at the speed of electric current, thousands of miles a\r\nsecond. So, by closing the right gates each fraction of a second,\r\nwe can flash numbers and information through the system and perform\r\noperations of reasoning. Thus we obtain a mechanical brain.\r\n\r\nIn general, a mechanical brain is made up of:\r\n\r\n    1. A quantity of registers where information (numbers and\r\n       instructions) can be stored.\r\n\r\n    2. Channels along which information can be sent.\r\n\r\n    3. Mechanisms that can carry out arithmetical and logical\r\n       operations.\r\n\r\n    4. A control, which guides the machine to perform a sequence\r\n       of operations.\r\n\r\n    5. Input and output devices, whereby information can go\r\n       into the machine and come out of it.\r\n\r\n    6. Motors or electricity, which provide energy.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE KINDS OF THINKING A MECHANICAL BRAIN CAN DO\r\n\r\nThere are many kinds of thinking that mechanical brains can do. Among\r\nother things, they can:\r\n\r\n     1. Learn what you tell them.\r\n     2. Apply the instructions when needed.\r\n     3. Read and remember numbers.\r\n     4. Add, subtract, multiply, divide, and round off.\r\n     5. Look up numbers in tables.\r\n     6. Look at a result, and make a choice.\r\n     7. Do long chains of these operations one after another.\r\n     8. Write out an answer.\r\n     9. Make sure the answer is right.\r\n    10. Know that one problem is finished, and turn to another.\r\n    11. Determine _most_ of their own instructions.\r\n    12. Work unattended.\r\n\r\nThey do these things much better than you or I. They are fast. The\r\nmechanical brain built at the Moore School of Electrical Engineering at\r\nthe University of Pennsylvania does 5000 additions a second. They are\r\nreliable. Even with hundreds of thousands of parts, the existing giant\r\nbrains have worked successfully. They have remarkably few mechanical\r\ntroubles; in fact, for one of the giant brains, a mechanical failure\r\nis of the order of once a month. They are powerful. The big machine\r\nat Harvard can remember 72 numbers each of 23 digits at one time and\r\ncan do 3 operations with these numbers every second. The mechanical\r\nbrains that have been finished are able to solve problems that have\r\nbaffled men for many, many years, and they think in ways never open to\r\nmen before. Mechanical brains have removed the limits on complexity of\r\nroutine: the machine can carry out a complicated routine as easily as\r\na simple one. Already, processes for solving problems are being worked\r\nout so that the mechanical brain will itself determine more than 99 per\r\ncent of all the routine orders that it is to carry out.\r\n\r\nBut, you may ask, can they do any kind of thinking? The answer is no.\r\nNo mechanical brain so far built can:\r\n\r\n    1. Do intuitive thinking.\r\n    2. Make bright guesses, and leap to conclusions.\r\n    3. Determine _all_ its own instructions.\r\n    4. Perceive complex situations outside itself and interpret them.\r\n\r\nA clever wild animal, for example, a fox, can do all these things; a\r\nmechanical brain, not yet. There is, however, good reason to believe\r\nthat most, if not all, of these operations will in the future be\r\nperformed not only by animals but also by machines. Men have only just\r\nbegun to construct mechanical brains. All those finished are children;\r\nthey have all been born since 1940. Soon there will be much more\r\nremarkable giant brains.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHY ARE THESE GIANT BRAINS IMPORTANT?\r\n\r\nMost of the thinking so far done by these machines is with numbers.\r\nThey have already solved problems in airplane design, astronomy,\r\nphysics, mathematics, engineering, and many other sciences, that\r\npreviously could not be solved. To find the solutions of these\r\nproblems, mathematicians would have had to work for years and years,\r\nusing the best known methods and large staffs of human computers.\r\n\r\nThese mechanical brains not only calculate, however. They also remember\r\nand reason, and thus they promise to solve some very important human\r\nproblems. For example, one of these problems is the application of what\r\nmankind knows. It takes too long to find understandable information\r\non a subject. The libraries are full of books: most of them we can\r\nnever hope to read in our lifetime. The technical journals are full of\r\ncondensed scientific information: they can hardly be understood by you\r\nand me. There is a big gap between somebody’s knowing something and\r\nemployment of that knowledge by you or me when we need it. But these\r\nnew mechanical brains handle information very swiftly. In a few years\r\nmachines will probably be made that will know what is in libraries and\r\nthat will tell very swiftly where to find certain information. Thus\r\nwe can see that mechanical brains are one of the great new tools for\r\nfinding out what we do not know and applying what we do know.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 2\r\n\r\nLANGUAGES:\r\n\r\nSYSTEMS FOR HANDLING INFORMATION\r\n\r\n\r\nAs everyone knows, it is not always easy to think. By _thinking_,\r\nwe mean computing, reasoning, and other handling of information. By\r\n_information_ we mean collections of ideas—physically, collections of\r\nmarks that have meaning. By _handling_ information, we mean proceeding\r\nlogically from some ideas to other ideas—physically, changing from\r\nsome marks to other marks in ways that have meaning. For example, one\r\nof your hands can express an idea: it can store the number 3 for a\r\nshort while by turning 3 fingers up and 2 down. In the same way, a\r\nmachine can express an idea: it can store information by arranging some\r\nequipment. The Harvard mechanical brain can store 132 numbers between\r\n0 and 99,999,999,999,999,999,999,999 for days. When you want to change\r\nthe number stored by your fingers, you move them: perhaps you need a\r\nhalf second to change the number stored by your fingers from 3 to 2,\r\nfor example. In the same way, a machine can change a stored number by\r\nchanging the arrangement of some equipment: the electronic brain Eniac\r\ncan change a stored number in ¹/₅₀₀₀ of a second.\r\n\r\n\r\nLANGUAGES\r\n\r\nSince it is not always easy to think, men have given much attention to\r\ndevices for making thinking easier. They have worked out many _systems\r\nfor handling information_, which we often call _languages_. Some\r\nlanguages are very complete and versatile and of great importance.\r\nOthers cover only a narrow field—such as numbers alone—but in this\r\nfield they may be remarkably efficient. Just what is a language?\r\n\r\nEvery language is both a _scheme for expressing meanings_ and _physical\r\nequipment_ that can be handled. For example, let us take _spoken\r\nEnglish_. The scheme of spoken English consists of more than 150,000\r\nwords expressing meanings, and some rules for putting words together\r\nmeaningfully. The physical equipment of spoken English consists of\r\n(1) sounds in the air, and (2) the ears of millions of people, and\r\ntheir mouths and voices, by which they can hear and speak the sounds\r\nof English. For another example, let us take numbers expressed in\r\nthe _Arabic numerals_ and the rules of arithmetic. The scheme of\r\nthis language contains only ten digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\r\nor their equivalents, and some rules for combining them. Sufficient\r\nphysical equipment for this language might very well be a ten-column\r\ndesk calculating machine with its counter wheels, gears, keys, etc. If\r\nwe tried to exchange the physical equipment of these two languages, we\r\nwould be blocked: the desk calculating machine cannot possibly express\r\nthe meaningful combinations of 150,000 words, and sounds in the air\r\nare not permanent enough to express the steps of division of one large\r\nnumber by another.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCHEMES FOR EXPRESSING MEANINGS\r\n\r\nIf we examine languages that have existed, we can observe a number of\r\nschemes for expressing meanings. In the table on pp. 12-13 is a rough\r\nlist of a dozen of them. From among these we can choose the schemes\r\nthat are likely to be useful in mechanical brains. Schemes 11 and 12\r\nare the schemes that have been predominantly used in machinery for\r\ncomputing. Scheme 12 consisting of combinations of just two marks,\r\n✓, ✕, provides one of the best codes for mechanical handling of\r\ninformation. This scheme, called _binary coding_ (see Supplement 2), is\r\nalso useful for measuring the quantity of information.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUANTITY OF INFORMATION\r\n\r\nHow should we measure the quantity of information? The smallest unit\r\nof information is a “yes” or a “no,” a check mark (✓) or a cross (✕),\r\nan impulse in a nerve or no impulse, a 1 or a 0, black or white,\r\ngood or bad, etc. This twofold difference is called a _binary digit_\r\nof information (see Supplement 2). It is the convenient _unit of\r\ninformation_.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCHEMES FOR EXPRESSING MEANINGS\r\n\r\n                                      EXAMPLE:\r\n                        /————————————————^—————————————————\\\r\n         PRINCIPLE      SIGN       USED IN      SIGNIFICANCE    NAME OF\r\n    NO.

For example, we\r\nmay have:\r\n\r\n    0 0000      5 0101\r\n    1 0001      6 0110\r\n    2 0010      7 0111\r\n    3 0011      8 1000\r\n    4 0100      9 1001\r\n\r\nWe say, therefore, that a decimal digit 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 is\r\n_equivalent_ to 4 units of information. Thus a table containing 10,000\r\nnumbers, each of 10 decimal digits, is equivalent to 400,000 units of\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\nOne of the 26 letters of the alphabet is equivalent to 5 units\r\nof information, for, 5 binary digits (1 or 0) have 32 possible\r\narrangements, and these are enough to provide for the 26 letters. Any\r\nprinted information in English can be expressed in about 80 characters\r\nconsisting of 10 numerals, 52 capital and small letters, and some 18\r\npunctuation marks and other types of marks; 6 binary digits (1 or 0)\r\nhave 64 possible arrangements, and 7 binary digits (1 or 0) have 128\r\npossible arrangements. Each character in a printed book, therefore, is\r\nroughly equivalent to 7 units of information.\r\n\r\nIt can be determined that a big telephone book or a big reference\r\ndictionary stores printed information at the rate of about 1 billion\r\nunits of information per cubic foot. If the 10 billion nerves in the\r\nhuman brain could independently be impulsed or not impulsed, then the\r\nhuman brain could conceivably store 10 billion units of information.\r\nThe largest library in the world is the Library of Congress, containing\r\n7 million volumes including pamphlets. It stores about 100 trillion\r\nunits of information.\r\n\r\nWe can thus see the significance of a _quantity of information_ from\r\n1 unit to 100 trillion units. No distinction is here made between\r\ninformation that reports facts and information that does not. For\r\nexample, a book of fiction about persons who never existed is\r\nstill counted as information, and, of course, much instruction and\r\nentertainment may be found in such a source.\r\n\r\n\r\nPHYSICAL EQUIPMENT FOR HANDLING INFORMATION\r\n\r\nThe first thing we want to do with information is _store_ it. The\r\nsecond thing we want to do is _combine_ it. We want equipment that\r\nmakes these two processes easy and efficient. We want equipment for\r\nhandling information that:\r\n\r\n    1. Costs little.\r\n\r\n    2. Holds much information in little space.\r\n\r\n    3. Is _permanent_, when we want to keep the information.\r\n\r\n    4. Is _erasable_, when we want to remove information.\r\n\r\n    5. Is _versatile_, holds easily any kind of information,\r\n       and allows operations to be done easily.\r\n\r\nThe amount of human effort needed to handle information correctly\r\ndepends very much on the properties of the physical equipment\r\nexpressing the information, although the laws of correct reasoning are\r\nindependent of the equipment. For example, the great difficulty with\r\nspoken sounds as physical equipment for handling information is the\r\ntrouble of storing them. The technique for doing so was mastered only\r\nabout 1877 when Thomas A. Edison made the first phonograph. Even with\r\nthis advance, no one can glance at a soundtrack and tell quickly what\r\nsounds are stored there; only by turning back the machine and listening\r\nto a groove can we determine this. It was not possible for the men of\r\n2000 B.C. to wait thousands of years for the storing of spoken sounds.\r\nThe problem of storing information was accordingly taken to other types\r\nof physical equipment.\r\n\r\n\r\nPHYSICAL EQUIPMENT FOR HANDLING INFORMATION\r\n\r\n        PHYSICAL  ARRANGED   OPERATED OR  LOW   LITTLE PERM-  ERAS- VERS-\r\n    NO.

In the table on pp. 16-17 is a rough list of\r\n25 types of physical equipment for handling information. ✓✓ means “yes,\r\nvery;” ✓ means “yes, adequately;” ✕ means “not generally;” ✕✕ means\r\n“not at all.”\r\n\r\nFor example, our _fingers_ (see No. 13) as a device for handling\r\ninformation are very expensive for most cases. They take up a good deal\r\nof space. Certainly they are very temporary storage; any information\r\nthey may express is very erasable; and what we can express with them\r\nalone is very limited. Yet, with a _typewriter_ (see No. 11), our\r\nfingers become versatile and efficient. In fact, our fingers can make\r\n4 strokes a second; we can select any one of about 38 keys; and, since\r\neach key is equivalent to 5 or 6 units of information, the effective\r\nspeed of our fingers may be about 800 units of information a second.\r\n\r\n\r\nLANGUAGES OF PHYSICAL OBJECTS\r\n\r\nThe use of pebbles (see No. 14) for keeping track of numerical\r\ninformation is shown in the history of the words containing the\r\nroot _calc_-of the word _calculate_. The Latin word _calcis_ meant\r\npertaining to lime or limestone, and the Latin word _calculus_ derived\r\nfrom it meant first a small piece of limestone, and later any small\r\nstone, particularly a pebble used in counting. All three of these\r\nmeanings have left descendants: “chalk,” “calcite,” “calcium,” relating\r\nin one way or another to lime; in medicine, “calculus,” referring to\r\nstones in the kidneys or elsewhere in the body; and in mathematics,\r\n“calculate,” “calculus,” referring to computations, once done with\r\npebbles.\r\n\r\nThe pebbles, and the slab (for which the ancient Greek word is _abax_)\r\non which they were arranged and counted, were later replaced, for ease\r\nin handling, by groups of beads strung on rods and placed in a frame\r\n(see No. 17). These constituted the _abacus_ (see Supplement 2 and the\r\nfigure there). This was the first calculating machine. It is still\r\nused all over Asia; in fact, even today more people use the abacus for\r\naccounting than use pencil and paper. The skill with which the abacus\r\ncan be used was shown in November 1946 in a well-publicized contest\r\nin Japan. Kiyoshi Mastuzaki, a clerk in the Japanese communications\r\ndepartment, using the abacus, challenged Private Thomas Wood of the U.\r\nS. Army, using a modern desk calculating machine, and defeated him in a\r\nspeed contest involving additions, subtractions, multiplications, and\r\ndivisions.\r\n\r\nThe heaps of small pebbles, the notches in sticks, and the abacus had\r\nthe advantage of being visible and comparatively permanent. Storing\r\nand reading were relatively easy. They were rather compact and easy\r\nto manipulate, certainly much easier than spoken words. But they were\r\nsubject to disadvantages also. Moving correctly from one arrangement\r\nto another was difficult, since there was no good way for storing\r\nintermediate steps so that the process could be easily verified.\r\nFurthermore, these devices applied to specified numbers only. Also,\r\nthere was no natural provision for recording what the several numbers\r\nbelonged to. This had to be recorded with the help of another language,\r\nwriting.\r\n\r\nThe language of physical objects was picked up from obscurity by\r\nthe invention of motors and the demands of commerce and business.\r\nCommencing in the late 1800’s, _desk calculating machines_ (see No. 19)\r\nwere constructed to meet mass calculation requirements. They would add,\r\nsubtract, multiply, and divide specific numbers with great accuracy\r\nand speed. But until recently they still were adjuncts to the other\r\nlanguages, for they provided figures one at a time for insertion in the\r\nspaces on the ledger pages or calculation sheets where figures were\r\ncalled for.\r\n\r\nBeginning in the 1920’s, a remarkable change has taken place. Instead\r\nof performing single operations, machines have been developed to\r\nperform chains of operations with many kinds of information. One\r\nof these machines is the _dial telephone_: it can select one of 7\r\nmillion telephones by successive sorting according to the letters\r\nand digits of a telephone number. Another of these machines is a\r\n_fire-control instrument_, a mechanism for controlling the firing\r\nof a gun. For example, in a modern anti-aircraft gun the mechanism\r\nwill observe an enemy plane flying at several hundred miles an hour,\r\nconvert the observations into gun-aiming directions, and determine the\r\naiming directions fast enough to shoot down the plane. _Punch-card\r\nmachinery_, machines handling information expressed as punched holes\r\nin cards, enable the fulfillment of social security legislation, the\r\nproduction of the census, and countless operations of banks, insurance\r\ncompanies, department stores, and factories. And, finally, in 1942 the\r\nfirst _mechanical brain_ was finished at Massachusetts Institute of\r\nTechnology.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CRUCIAL DEVICES FOR MECHANICAL BRAINS\r\n\r\nLet us consider the two modern physical devices for handling\r\ninformation which make mechanical brains possible. These are _relays_\r\nand _electronic tubes_ (Nos. 21 and 22). The last three kinds of\r\nequipment listed in the table (_magnetic surfaces_, No. 23; _delay\r\nlines_, No. 24; and _electrostatic storage tubes_, No. 25) were not\r\nincluded in any mechanical brains functioning by the middle of 1948.\r\nThe discussion of them is therefore put off to Chapter 10, where we\r\ntalk about the future design of mechanical brains.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1. Relay]\r\n\r\nFigure 1 shows a simple relay. There are two electrical circuits\r\nhere. One has two terminals—Pickup and Ground. The other has three\r\nterminals—Common, Normally Open, and Normally Closed. When current\r\nflows through the coil of wire around the iron, it makes the iron\r\na magnet; the magnet pulls down the flap of iron above, overcoming\r\nthe force of the spring. When there is no current through the coil,\r\nthe iron is not a magnet, and the flap is held up by the spring. Now\r\nsuppose that there is current in Common. When there is no current in\r\nPickup, the current from Common will flow through the upper contact, to\r\nthe terminal marked Normally Closed. When there is current in Pickup,\r\nthe current from Common will flow through the lower contact, to the\r\nterminal marked Normally Open. Thus we see that a relay expresses a\r\n“yes” or a “no,” a 1 or 0, a binary digit, a unit of information. A\r\nrelay costs $5 to $10. It is rather expensive for storing a single unit\r\nof information. The fastest it can be changed from 1 to 0, or vice\r\nversa, is about ¹/₁₀₀ of a second.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2. Electronic tube.]\r\n\r\nFigure 2 shows a simple electronic tube. It has three parts—the\r\nCathode, the Grid, and the Plate. The Grid actually is a coarse net\r\nof metal wires. Electrons can flow from the Cathode to the Plate,\r\nprovided the voltage on the Grid is such as to permit them to flow.\r\nSo we can see that an electronic tube is a very simple on-off device\r\nand expresses a “yes” or a “no,” a 1 or 0, a binary digit, a unit of\r\ninformation. A simple electronic tube suitable for calculating purposes\r\ncosts 50 cents to a $1, only ⅒ the cost of a relay. It can be changed\r\nfrom 1 to 0, or back again, in 1 millionth of a second.\r\n\r\nRelays have been widely used in the mechanical brains so far built, and\r\nelectronic tubes are the essence of Eniac.\r\n\r\nIn the next chapter, we shall see how physical equipment for handling\r\ninformation can be put together to make a simple mechanical brain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 3\r\n\r\nA MACHINE THAT WILL THINK:\r\n\r\nTHE DESIGN OF A VERY SIMPLE MECHANICAL BRAIN\r\n\r\n\r\nWe shall now consider how we can design a very simple machine that will\r\nthink. Let us call it Simon, because of its predecessor, Simple Simon.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIMON, THE VERY SIMPLE MECHANICAL BRAIN\r\n\r\nBy designing Simon, we shall see how we can put together physical\r\nequipment for handling information in such a way as to get a very\r\nsimple mechanical brain. At every point in the design of Simon, we\r\nshall make the simplest possible choice that will still give us a\r\nmachine that: handles information, transfers information automatically\r\nfrom one part of the machine to another, and has control over the\r\nsequence of operations. Simon is so simple and so small, in fact, that\r\nit could be built to fill up less space than a grocery-store box, about\r\n4 cubic feet. If we know a little about electrical work, we will find\r\nit rather easy to make Simon.\r\n\r\nWhat do we do first to design the very simple mechanical brain, Simon?\r\n\r\n\r\nSIMON’S FLESH AND NERVES—REPRESENTING INFORMATION\r\n\r\nThe first thing we have to decide about Simon is how information will\r\nbe represented: as we put it into Simon, as it is moved around inside\r\nof Simon, and as it comes out of Simon. We need to decide what physical\r\nequipment we shall use to make Simon’s flesh and nerves. Since we are\r\ntaking the simplest convenient solution to each problem, let us decide\r\nto use: _punched paper tape_ for putting information in, _relays_ (see\r\nChapter 2) and wires for storing and transferring information, and\r\n_lights_ for putting information out.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TWO-HOLED TAPE READER: Simon’s left ear that listens to\r\nnumbers and operations.\r\n\r\nFOUR-HOLED TAPE READER: Simon’s right ear that listens to instructions.\r\n\r\nLIGHT BULBS: Simon’s eyes that wink answers.\r\n\r\nFIG. 1. Simon, the very simple mechanical brain.]\r\n\r\nFor the equipment inside Simon, we could choose either electronic tubes\r\nor relays. We choose relays, although they are slower, because it is\r\neasier to explain circuits using relays. We can look at a relay circuit\r\nlaid out on paper and tell how it works, just by seeing whether or not\r\ncurrent will flow. Examples will be given below. When we look at a\r\ncircuit using electronic tubes laid out on paper, we still need to know\r\na good deal in order to calculate just how it will work.\r\n\r\nHow will Simon perceive a number or other information by means of\r\npunched tape, or relays, or lights? With punched paper tape having, for\r\nexample, 2 spaces where holes may be, Simon can be told 4 numbers—00,\r\n01, 10, 11. Here the binary digit 1 means a hole punched; the binary\r\ndigit 0 means no hole punched. With 2 relays together in a register,\r\nSimon can remember any one of the 4 numbers 00, 01, 10, and 11. Here\r\nthe binary digit 1 means the relay picked up or energized or closed; 0\r\nmeans the relay not picked up or not energized or open. With 2 lights,\r\nSimon can give as an answer any one of the 4 numbers 00, 01, 10, 11. In\r\nthis case the binary digit 1 means the light glowing; 0 means the light\r\noff. (See Fig. 1.)\r\n\r\nWe can say that the two lights by which Simon puts out the answer\r\nare his _eyes_ and say that he tells his answer by _winking_. We can\r\nsay also that the two mechanisms for reading punched paper tape are\r\nSimon’s _ears_. One tape, called the _input tape_, takes in numbers\r\nor operations. The other tape takes in instructions and is called the\r\n_program tape_.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIMON’S MENTALITY—POSSIBLE RANGE OF INFORMATION\r\n\r\nWe can say that Simon has a _mentality_ of 4. We mean not age 4 but\r\njust the simple fact that Simon knows only 4 numbers and can do only 4\r\noperations with them. But Simon can keep on doing these operations in\r\nall sorts of routines as long as Simon has instructions. We decide that\r\nSimon will know just 4 numbers, 0, 1, 2, 3, in order to keep our model\r\nmechanical brain very simple. Then, for any register, we need only 2\r\nrelays; for any answer, we need only 2 lights.\r\n\r\nAny calculating machine has a _mentality_, consisting of the whole\r\ncollection of different ideas that the machine can ever actually\r\nexpress in one way or another. For example, a 10-place desk calculating\r\nmachine can handle numbers up to 10 decimal digits without additional\r\ncapacity. It cannot handle bigger numbers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2. Four directions.]\r\n\r\nWhat are the 4 _operations with numbers_ which Simon can carry out?\r\nLet us consider some simple operations that we can perform with just 4\r\nnumbers. Suppose that they stood for 4 directions in the order east,\r\nnorth, west, south (see Fig. 2). Or suppose that they stood for a turn\r\ncounterclockwise through some right angles as follows:\r\n\r\n    0: Turn through   0°, or no right angles.\r\n    1: Turn through  90°, or  1 right angle.\r\n    2: Turn through 180°, or  2 right angles.\r\n    3: Turn through 270°, or  3 right angles.\r\n\r\nThen we could have the operations of _addition_ and _negation_, defined\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n        ADDITION           NEGATION\r\n    _c_ = _a_ + _b_       _c_ = -_a_\r\n\r\n     _b_: 0 1 2 3          _a_|_c_\r\n    _a_ +—————————        ————+————\r\n     0  | 0 1 2 3           0 | 0\r\n     1  | 1 2 3 0           1 | 3\r\n     2  | 2 3 0 1           2 | 2\r\n     3  | 3 0 1 2           3 | 1\r\n\r\nFor example, the first table says, “1 plus 3 equals 0.” This means\r\nthat, if we turn 1 right angle and then turn in the same direction 3\r\nmore right angles, we face in exactly the same way as we did at the\r\nstart. This statement is clearly true. For another example, the second\r\ntable says, “2 is the negative of 2.” This means that, if we turn to\r\nthe left 2 right angles, we face in exactly the same way as if we turn\r\nto the right 2 right angles, and this statement also is, of course,\r\ntrue.\r\n\r\nWith only these two operations in Simon, we should probably find him a\r\nlittle too dull to tell us much. Let us, therefore, put into Simon two\r\nmore operations. Let us choose two operations involving both numbers\r\nand logic: in particular, (1) finding which of two numbers is greater\r\nand (2) selecting. In this way we shall make Simon a little cleverer.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to teach Simon how to find which of two numbers is the\r\ngreater when all the numbers that Simon has to know are 0, 1, 2, 3. We\r\nput all possible cases of two numbers _a_ and _b_ into a table:\r\n\r\n     _b_: 0 1 2 3\r\n    _a_+—————————\r\n     0 |\r\n     1 |\r\n     2 |\r\n     3 |\r\n\r\nThen we tell Simon that we shall mark with 1 the cases where _a_ is\r\ngreater than _b_ and mark with 0 the cases where _a_ is not greater\r\nthan _b_:\r\n\r\n    GREATER THAN\r\n\r\n     _b_: 0 1 2 3\r\n    _a_+—————————\r\n     0 |  0 0 0 0\r\n     1 |  1 0 0 0\r\n     2 |  1 1 0 0\r\n     3 |  1 1 1 0\r\nFor example, “2 is greater than 3” is false, so we put 0 in the table\r\non the 2 line in the 3 column. We see that, for the 16 possible cases,\r\n_a_ is greater than _b_ in 6 cases and _a_ is not greater than _b_ in\r\n10 cases.\r\n\r\nThere is a neat way of saying what we have just said, using the\r\nlanguage of _mathematical logic_ (see Chapter 9 and Supplement 2).\r\nSuppose that we consider the statement “_a_ is greater than _b_” where\r\n_a_ and _b_ may be any of the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3. We can say that the\r\n_truth value p_ of a _statement P_ is 1 if the statement is true and\r\nthat it is 0 if the statement is false:\r\n\r\n    _p_ = 1 if _P_ is true, 0 if _P_ is false\r\n\r\nThe truth value of a statement _P_ is conveniently denoted as _T_(_P_)\r\n(see Supplement 2):\r\n\r\n    _p_ = _T_(_P_)\r\n\r\nNow we can say that the table for the operation _greater than_ shows\r\nthe truth value of the statement “_a_ is greater than _b_”:\r\n\r\n    _p_ = _T_(_a_ > _b_)\r\n\r\nLet us turn now to the operation _selection_. By _selecting_ we mean\r\nchoosing one number _a_ if some statement _P_ is true and choosing\r\nanother number _b_ if that statement is not true. As before, let _p_\r\nbe the truth value of that statement _P_, and let it be equal to 1 if\r\n_P_ is true and to 0 if _P_ is false. Then the operation of selection\r\nis fully expressed in the following table and logical formula (see\r\nSupplement 2):\r\n\r\n    SELECTION _c_ = _a_·_p_ + _b_·(1 - _p_)\r\n\r\n     _p_: 0 0 0 0  1 1 1 1\r\n     _b_: 0 1 2 3  0 1 2 3\r\n    _a_+——————————————————\r\n     0 |  0 1 2 3  0 0 0 0\r\n     1 |  0 1 2 3  1 1 1 1\r\n     2 |  0 1 2 3  2 2 2 2\r\n     3 |  0 1 2 3  3 3 3 3\r\n\r\nFor example, suppose that _a_ is 2 and _b_ is 3 and the statement _P_\r\nis the statement “2 is greater than 0.” Since this statement is true,\r\n_p_ is 1, and\r\n\r\n    _a_·_p_ + _b_·(1 - _p_) = 2(1) + 3(0) = 2\r\nThis result is the same as selecting 2 if 2 is greater than 0 and\r\nselecting 3 if 2 is not greater than 0.\r\n\r\nThus we have four operations for Simon that do not overstrain his\r\nmentality; that is, they do not require him to go to any numbers other\r\nthan 0, 1, 2, and 3. These four operations are: addition, negation,\r\ngreater than, selection. We label these operations also with the\r\nnumbers 00 to 11 as follows: addition, 00; negation, 01; greater than,\r\n10; selection, 11.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIMON’S MEMORY—STORING INFORMATION\r\n\r\nThe _memory_ of a mechanical brain consists of physical equipment\r\nin which information can be stored. Usually, each section of the\r\nphysical equipment which can store one piece of information is called\r\na _register._ Each register in Simon will consist of 2 relays. Each\r\nregister will hold any of 00, 01, 10, 11. The information stored in\r\na register 00, 01, 10, 11 may express a number or may express an\r\noperation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: S1-2 Relay energized]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: S1-1 Relay not energized\r\n\r\nFIG. 3. Register _S_1 storing 10.]\r\n\r\nHow many registers will we need to put into Simon to store information?\r\nWe shall need one register to read the input tape and to store the\r\nnumber or operation recorded on it. We shall call this register the\r\n_input register I_. We shall need another register to store the number\r\nor operation that Simon says is the answer and to give it to the output\r\nlights. We shall call this register the _output register O_. We shall\r\nneed 5 registers for the part of Simon which does the computing, which\r\nwe shall call the _computer_: we shall need 3 to store numbers put into\r\nthe computer (_C_1, _C_2, _C_3), 1 to store the operation governing the\r\ncomputer (_C_4), and 1 to store the result (_C_5). Suppose that we\r\ndecide to have 8 registers for storing information, so as to provide\r\nsome flexibility for doing problems. We shall call these registers\r\n_storage registers_ and name them _S_1, _S_2, _S_3, ··· _S_8. Then\r\nSimon will have 15 registers: a memory that at one time can hold 15\r\npieces of information.\r\n\r\nHow will one of these registers hold information? For example, how\r\nwill register _S_1 hold the number 2 (see Fig. 3)? The number 2 in\r\nmachine language is 10. Register _S_1 consists of two relays, _S_1-2\r\nand _S_1-1. 10 stored in register _S_1 means that relay _S_1-2 will be\r\nenergized and that relay _S_1-1 will not be energized.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CONTROL OF SIMON\r\n\r\nSo far we have said nothing about the control of Simon. Is he docile?\r\nIs he stubborn? We know what his capacity is, but we do not know how to\r\ntell him to do anything. How do we connect our desires to his behavior?\r\nHow do we tell him a problem? How do we get him to solve it and tell\r\nus the answer? How do we arrange control over the sequence of his\r\noperations? For example, how do we get Simon to add 1 and 2 and tell us\r\nthe answer 3?\r\n\r\nOn the outside of Simon, we have said, there are two ears: little\r\nmechanisms for reading punched paper tape. Also there are two eyes\r\nthat can wink: light bulbs that by shining or not shining can put out\r\ninformation (see Fig. 1). One of the ears—let us call it the _left\r\near_—takes in information about a particular problem: numbers and\r\noperations. Here the _problem tape_ or _input tape_ is listened to.\r\nEach line on the input tape contains space for 2 punched holes. So, the\r\ninformation on the input tape may be 00, 01, 10, or 11—either a number\r\nor an operation. The other ear—let us call it the _right ear_—takes in\r\ninformation about the sequence of operations, the program or routine\r\nto be followed. Here the _program tape_ or _routine tape_ or _control\r\ntape_ is listened to. Each line on the program tape contains space for\r\n4 punched holes. We tell Simon by _instructions_ on the program tape\r\nwhat he is to do with the information that we give him on the input\r\ntape. The information on the program tape, therefore, may be 0000,\r\n0001, 0010, ···, 1111, or any number from 0 to 15 expressed in binary\r\nnotation (see Supplement 2).\r\n\r\nHow is this accomplished? In the first place, Simon is a machine, and\r\nhe behaves during time. He does different things from time to time.\r\nHis behavior is organized in _cycles_. He repeats a cycle of behavior\r\nevery second or so. In each cycle of Simon, he listens to or reads the\r\ninput tape once and he listens to or reads the program tape twice.\r\nEvery complete instruction that goes on the program tape tells Simon a\r\nregister from which information is to be sent and a register in which\r\ninformation is to be received. The first time that he reads the program\r\ntape he gets the name of the register that is to receive certain\r\ninformation, the _receiving register_. The second time he reads the\r\nprogram tape he gets the name of the register from which information is\r\nto be sent, the _sending register_. He finishes each cycle of behavior\r\nby transferring information from the sending register to the receiving\r\nregister.\r\n\r\nFor example, suppose that we want to get an answer out of Simon’s\r\ncomputer into Simon’s output lights. We put down the instruction\r\n\r\n    Send information from _C_5 into _O_\r\n\r\nor, more briefly,\r\n\r\n    _C_5 → _O_\r\n\r\nBut he does not understand this language. We must translate into\r\nmachine language, in this case punched holes in the program tape.\r\nNaturally, the punched holes in the program tape must be able to\r\nspecify any sending register and any receiving register. There are 15\r\nregisters, and so we give them punched hole _codes_ as follows:\r\n\r\n    REGISTER     CODE             REGISTER      CODE\r\n      _I_        0001               _C_1        1010\r\n      _S_1       0010               _C_2        1011\r\n      _S_2       0011               _C_3        1100\r\n      _S_3       0100               _C_4        1101\r\n      _S_4       0101               _C_5        1110\r\n      _S_5       0110               _O_         1111\r\n      _S_6       0111\r\n      _S_7       1000\r\n      _S_8       1001\r\n\r\nTo translate the direction of transfer of information, which we showed\r\nas an arrow, we put on the program tape the code for the receiving\r\nregister first—in this case, output, _O_, 1111—and the code for the\r\nsending register second—in this case, _C_5, 1110. The instruction\r\nbecomes 1111, 1110. The first time in any cycle that Simon listens with\r\nhis right ear, he knows that what he hears is the name of the receiving\r\nregister; and the second time that he listens, he knows that what he\r\nhears is the name of the sending register. One reason for this sequence\r\nis that any person or machine has to be prepared beforehand to absorb\r\nor take in any information.\r\n\r\nNow how do we tell Simon to add 1 and 2? On the input tape, we put:\r\n\r\n    Add   00\r\n     1    01\r\n     2    10\r\n\r\nOn the program tape, we need to put:\r\n\r\n      _I_  →  _C_4\r\n      _I_  →  _C_1\r\n      _I_  →  _C_2\r\n    _C_5   →  _O_\r\n\r\nwhich becomes:\r\n\r\n    1101, 0001;\r\n    1010, 0001;\r\n    1011, 0001;\r\n    1111, 1110\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE USEFULNESS OF SIMON\r\n\r\nThus we can see that Simon can do such a problem as:\r\n\r\n    Add 0 and 3. Add 2 and the negative of 1.\r\n    Find which result is greater.\r\n    Select 3 if this result equals 2; otherwise select 2.\r\n\r\nTo work out the coding for this and like problems would be a good\r\nexercise. Simon, in fact, is a rather clever little mechanical brain,\r\neven if he has only a mentality of 4.\r\n\r\nIt may seem that a simple model of a mechanical brain like Simon\r\nis of no great practical use. On the contrary, Simon has the same\r\nuse in instruction as a set of simple chemical experiments has: to\r\nstimulate thinking and understanding and to produce training and skill.\r\nA training course on mechanical brains could very well include the\r\nconstruction of a simple model mechanical brain as an exercise. In this\r\nbook, the properties of Simon may be a good introduction to the various\r\ntypes of more complicated mechanical brains described in later chapters.\r\n\r\nThe rest of this chapter is devoted to such questions as:\r\n\r\n    How do transfers of information actually take place\r\n      in Simon?\r\n\r\n    How does the computer in Simon work so that calculation\r\n      actually occurs?\r\n\r\n    How could Simon actually be constructed?\r\n\r\nWhat follows should be skipped unless you are interested in these\r\nquestions and the burdensome details needed for answering them.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIMON’S THINKING—TRANSFERRING INFORMATION\r\n\r\nThe first basic thinking operation for any mechanical brain is\r\ntransferring information automatically. Let us see how this is done in\r\nSimon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4. Scheme of Simon.]\r\n\r\nLet us first take a look at the scheme of Simon as a mechanical brain\r\n(see Fig. 4). We have 1 input, 8 storage, 5 computer, and 1 output\r\nregisters, which are connected by means of transfer wires or a transfer\r\nline along which numbers or operations can travel as electrical\r\nimpulses. This transfer line is often called the _bus_, perhaps because\r\nit is always busy carrying something. In Simon the bus will consist of\r\n2 wires, one for carrying the right-hand digit and one for carrying the\r\nleft-hand digit of any number 00, 01, 10, 11. Simon also has a number\r\nof neat little devices that will do the following:\r\n\r\n    When any number goes into a register, the coils of the\r\n      relays of the register will be connected with the bus.\r\n\r\n    When any number goes out of a register, the contacts of\r\n      the relays of the register will be connected with the bus.\r\n\r\nFor example, suppose that in register _C_5 the number 2 is stored. In\r\nmachine language this is 10. That means the left-hand relay (_C_5-2) is\r\nenergized and the right-hand relay (_C_5-1) is not energized. Suppose\r\nthat we want to transfer this number 2 into the output register _O_,\r\nwhich has been cleared. What do we do?\r\n\r\nLet us take a look at a circuit that will transfer the number (see\r\nFig. 5). First we see two relays in this circuit. They belong to the\r\n_C_5 register. The _C_5-2 relay is energized since it holds 1; current\r\nis flowing through its coil, the iron core becomes a magnet, and the\r\ncontact above it is pulled down. The _C_5-1 relay is not energized\r\nsince it holds 0; its contact is not pulled down. The next thing we\r\nsee is two _rectifiers_. The sign for these is a triangle. These are\r\nsome modern electrical equipment that allow electrical current to\r\nflow in only one direction. In the diagram, the direction is shown by\r\nthe pointing of the triangle along the wire. Rectifiers are needed to\r\nprevent undesired circuits. Next, we see the bus, consisting of two\r\nwires. One carries the impulses for left-hand or 2 relays, and the\r\nother carries impulses for the right-hand or 1 relays. Next, we see\r\ntwo relays, called the _entrance relays_ for the _O_ register. Current\r\nfrom Source 1 may flow to these relays, energize them, and close their\r\ncontacts. When the first line of the program tape is read, specifying\r\nthe receiving register, the code 1111 causes Source 1 to be energized.\r\nThis fact is shown schematically by the arrow running from the program\r\ntape code 1111 to Source 1. Finally, we see the coils of the two\r\nrelays for the Output or _O_ register. We thus see that we have a\r\ncircuit from the contacts of the _C_5 register through the bus to the\r\ncoils of the _O_ register.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5. Transfer circuit.]\r\n\r\nWe are now ready to transfer information when the second line of the\r\nprogram tape is read. This line holds 1110 and designates _C_5 as the\r\nsending register and causes Source 2 to be energized. This fact is\r\nshown schematically by the arrow running from the second line of the\r\nprogram tape to Source 2. When the second line is read, current flows:\r\n\r\n    1. From Source 2.\r\n\r\n    2. Through the contacts of the _C_5 register if closed.\r\n\r\n    3. Through the rectifiers.\r\n\r\n    4. Through the bus.\r\n\r\n    5. Through the entrance relay contacts of the _O_ register.\r\n\r\n    6. Through the coils of the _O_ register relays, energizing\r\n       such of them as match with the _C_5 closed contacts; and\r\n       finally\r\n\r\n    7. Into the ground.\r\n\r\nThus relay _O_-2 is energized; it receives current because contact\r\n_C_5-2 is closed. And relay _O_-1 is not energized; it receives no\r\ncurrent since contact _C_5-1 is open. So we have actually transferred\r\ninformation from the _C_5 register to the _O_ register.\r\n\r\nThe same process in principle applies to all transfers:\r\n\r\n    The pattern of electrical impulses, formed by the positioning\r\n    of one register, is produced in the positioning of another\r\n    register.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIMON’S COMPUTING AND REASONING\r\n\r\nNow so far the computing registers in Simon are a mystery. We have said\r\nthat _C_1, _C_2, and _C_3 take in numbers 00, 01, 10, 11, that _C_4\r\ntakes in an operation 00, 01, 10, 11, and that _C_5 holds the result.\r\nWhat process does Simon use so that he has the correct result in\r\nregister _C_5?\r\n\r\nLet us take the simplest computing operation first and see what sort of\r\na circuit using relays will give us the result. The simplest computing\r\noperation is _negation_. In negation, a number 00, 01, 10, 11 goes into\r\nthe _C_1 register, and the operation 01 meaning negation goes into the\r\n_C_4 register, and the correct result must be in the _C_5 register. So,\r\nfirst, we note the fact that the _C_4-2 relay must not be energized,\r\nsince it contains 0, and that the _C_4-1 relay must be energized, since\r\nit contains 1.\r\n\r\nNow the table for negation, with _c_ =-_a_, is:\r\n\r\n    _a_ | _c_\r\n    ————+————\r\n     0  |  0\r\n     1  |  3\r\n     2  |  2\r\n     3  |  1\r\n\r\nNegation in machine language will be:\r\n\r\n    _a_ | _c_\r\n    ————+————\r\n     00 | 00\r\n     01 | 11\r\n     10 | 10\r\n     11 | 01\r\n\r\nNow if _a_ is in the _C_1 register and if _c_ is in the _C_5 register,\r\nthen negation will be:\r\n\r\n    _C_1 | _C_5\r\n    —————+—————\r\n     00  |  00\r\n     01  |  11\r\n     10  |  10\r\n     11  |  01\r\n\r\nBut each of these registers _C_1, _C_5 will be made up of two relays,\r\nthe left-hand or 2 relay and the right-hand or 1 relay. So, in terms of\r\nthese relays, negation will be:\r\n\r\n    _C_1-2 _C_1-1 | _C_5-2 _C_5-1\r\n    ——————————————+——————————————\r\n      0      0    |   0      0\r\n      0      1    |   1      1\r\n      1      0    |   1      0\r\n      1      1    |   0      1\r\n\r\nNow, on examining the table, we see that the _C_5-1 relay is energized\r\nif and only if the _C_1-1 relay is energized. So, in order to energize\r\nthe _C_5-1 relay, all we have to do is transfer the information from\r\n_C_1-1 to _C_5-1. This we can do by the circuit shown in Fig. 6. (In\r\nthis and later diagrams, we have taken one more step in streamlining\r\nthe drawing of relay contacts: the contacts are drawn, but the coils\r\nthat energize them are represented only by their names.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6. Negation—right-hand digit.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7. Negation—left-hand digit.]\r\n\r\nTaking another look at the table, we see also that the _C_5-2 relay\r\nmust be energized if and only if:\r\n\r\n    _C_1-2     AND     _C_1-1\r\n     HOLDS:             HOLDS:\r\n       0                  1\r\n       1                  0\r\n\r\nA circuit that will do this is the one shown in Fig. 7. In Fig. 8 is a\r\ncircuit that will do all the desired things together: give the right\r\ninformation to the _C_5 relay coils if and only if the _C_4 relays hold\r\n01.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8. Negation circuit.]\r\n\r\nLet us check this circuit. First, if there is any operation other than\r\n01 stored in the _C_4 relays, then no current will be able to get\r\nthrough the _C_4 contacts shown and into the _C_5 relay coils, and the\r\nresult is blank. Second, if we have the operation 01 stored in the _C_4\r\nrelays, then the _C_4-2 contacts will not be energized—a condition\r\nwhich passes current—and the _C_4-1 contacts will be energized—another\r\ncondition which passes current—and:\r\n\r\n    IF THE NUMBER                                  AND THE _C_5 RELAYS\r\n     IN _C_1 IS:    THEN _C_1-1:    AND _C_1-2:      ENERGIZED ARE:\r\n          0        does not close  does not close     neither\r\n          1        closes          does not close    _C_5-2, _C_5-1\r\n          2        does not close  closes            _C_5-2 only\r\n          3        closes          closes            _C_5-1 only\r\n\r\nThus we have shown that this circuit is correct.\r\n\r\nWe see that this circuit uses more than one set of contacts for several\r\nrelays (_C_1-2, _C_4-1, _C_4-2); relays are regularly made with 4, 6,\r\nor 12 sets of contacts arranged side by side, all controlled by the\r\nsame pickup coil. These are called 4-, 6-, or 12-_pole_ relays.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9. Addition circuit.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10. Greater-than circuit.]\r\n\r\nCircuits for _addition_, _greater than_, and _selection_ can also be\r\ndetermined rather easily (see Figs. 9, 10, 11). (_Note_: By means of\r\nthe _algebra of logic_, referred to in Chapter 9 and Supplement 2, the\r\nconditions for many relay circuits, as well as the circuit itself, may\r\nbe expressed algebraically, and the two expressions may be checked by\r\na mathematical process.) For example, let us check that the addition\r\ncircuit in Fig. 9 will enable us to add 1 and 2 and obtain 3. We take\r\na colored pencil and draw closed the contacts for _C_1-1 (since _C_1\r\nholds 01) and for _C_2-2 (since _C_2 holds 10). Then, when we trace\r\nthrough the circuit, remembering that addition is stored as 00 in the\r\n_C_4 relays, we find that both the _C_5 relays are energized. Hence\r\n_C_5 holds 11, which is 3. Thus Simon can add 1 and 2 and make 3!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11. Selection Circuit.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPUTTING SIMON TOGETHER\r\n\r\nIn order to put Simon together and make him work, not very much is\r\nneeded. On the outside of Simon we shall need two small mechanisms for\r\nreading punched paper tape. Inside Simon, there will be about 50 relays\r\nand perhaps 100 feet of wire for connecting them. In addition to the 15\r\nregisters (_I_, _S_1 to _S_8, _C_1 to _C_5, and _O_), we shall need a\r\nregister of 4 relays, which we shall call the _program register_. This\r\nregister will store the successive instructions read off the program\r\ntape. We can call the 4 relays of this register _P_8, _P_4, _P_2, _P_1.\r\nFor example, if the _P_8 and _P_2 relays are energized, the register\r\nholds 1010, and this is the program instruction that calls for the 8th\r\nplus 2nd, or 10th, register, which is _C_1.\r\n\r\nFor connecting receiving registers to the bus, we shall need a relay\r\nwith 2 poles, one for the 2-line and one for the 1-line, for each\r\nregister that can receive a number from the bus. For example, for\r\nentering the output register, we actually need only one 2-pole relay\r\ninstead of the two 1-pole relays drawn for simplicity in Fig. 5. There\r\nwill be 13 2-pole relays for this purpose, since only 13 registers\r\nreceive numbers from the bus; registers _I_ and _C_5 do not receive\r\nnumbers from the bus. We call these 13 relays the _entrance relays_ or\r\n_E relays_, since _E_ is the initial letter of the word entrance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12. Select-Receiving-Register circuit.]\r\n\r\nThe circuit for selecting and energizing the _E_ relays is shown in\r\nFig. 12. We call this circuit the _Select-Receiving-Register_ circuit.\r\nFor example, suppose that the _P_8 and _P_2 relays are energized. Then\r\nthis circuit energizes the _E_10 relay. The _E_10 relay closes the\r\ncontacts between the _C_1 relay coils and the bus; and so it connects\r\nthe _C_1 register to receive the next number that is sent into the bus.\r\nThis kind of circuit expresses a classification and is sometimes called\r\na _pyramid circuit_ since it spreads out like a pyramid. A similar\r\npyramid circuit is used to select the sending register.\r\n\r\nWe shall need a relay for moving the input tape a step at a time. We\r\nshall call this relay the _MI relay_, for _m_oving _i_nput tape. We\r\nalso need a relay for moving the program tape a step at a time. We\r\nshall call this relay the _MP relay_ for _m_oving _p_rogram tape. Here\r\nthen is approximately the total number of relays required:\r\n\r\n          RELAYS                        NAME                NUMBER\r\n    _I_, _S_, _C_, _O_    Input, Storage, Computer, Output    30\r\n    _P_                   Program                              4\r\n    _E_                   Entrance                            13\r\n    _MI_                  Move Input Tape                      1\r\n    _MP_                  Move Program Tape                    1\r\n                                                             ————\r\n                              Total                           49\r\n\r\nA few more relays may be needed to provide more contacts or poles. For\r\nexample, a single _P_1 relay will probably not have enough poles to\r\nmeet all the need for its contacts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13. Latch relay.]\r\n\r\nEach cycle of the machine will be divided into 5 equal _time intervals_\r\nor _times_ 1 to 5. The timing of the machine will be about as follows:\r\n\r\n    TIME                                ACTION\r\n     1  Move program tape. Move input tape if read out of in last\r\n        cycle.\r\n     2  Read program tape, determining the receiving register.\r\n        Read through the computing circuit setting up the\r\n        _C_5 register.\r\n     3  Move program tape. Energize the _E_ relay belonging\r\n        to the receiving register.\r\n     4  Read program tape again, determining the sending register.\r\n     5  Transfer information by reading through the\r\n        Select-Sending-Register circuit and the\r\n        Select-Receiving-Register circuit.\r\n\r\nIn order that information may remain in storage until wanted, register\r\nrelays should hold their information until just before the next\r\ninformation is received. This can be accomplished by keeping current in\r\ntheir coils or in other ways. There is a type of relay called a _latch\r\nrelay_, which is made with two coils and a latch. This type of relay\r\nhas the property of staying or latching in either position until the\r\nopposite coil is impulsed (see Fig. 13). This type of relay would be\r\nespecially good for the registers of Simon.\r\n\r\nIf any reader sets to work to construct Simon, and if questions arise,\r\nthe author will be glad to try to answer them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 4\r\n\r\nCOUNTING HOLES:\r\n\r\nPUNCH-CARD CALCULATING MACHINES\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen we think of counting, we usually think of saying softly to\r\nourselves “one, two, three, four, ···.” This is a good way to find the\r\ntotal of a small group of objects. But when we have a large group of\r\nobjects or a great many groups of objects to be counted, a much faster\r\nway of counting is needed. A very fast way of sorting and counting is\r\n_punch-card calculating machinery_. This is machinery which handles\r\ninformation expressed as holes in cards. _Punch-card machines_ can:\r\n\r\n    Sort, count, file, select, and copy information,\r\n    Make comparisons, and choose according to instructions,\r\n    Add, subtract, multiply, and divide,\r\n    List information, and print totals.\r\n\r\nFor example, in a life insurance company, much routine handling of\r\ninformation about insurance policies is necessary:\r\n\r\n    Writing information on newly issued policies.\r\n\r\n    Setting up policy-history cards.\r\n\r\n    Making out notices of premiums due.\r\n\r\n    Making registers of policies in force, lapsed, died, etc.,\r\n      for purposes of valuation as required by law or good\r\n      management.\r\n\r\n    Calculating and tabulating premium rates, dividend rates,\r\n      reserve factors, etc.\r\n\r\n    Computing and tabulating expected and actual death rates;\r\n      and much more.\r\n\r\nAll these operations can be done almost automatically by punch-card\r\nmachines.\r\n\r\n\r\nORIGIN AND DEVELOPMENT\r\n\r\nWhen a census of the people of a country is taken, a great quantity of\r\nsorting and counting is needed: by village, county, city, and state;\r\nby sex; by age; by occupation; etc. In 1886, the census of the people\r\nof the United States which had been taken in 1880 was still being\r\nsorted and counted. Among the men then studying census problems was\r\na statistician and inventor, Herman Hollerith. He saw that existing\r\nmethods were so slow that the next census (1890) would not be finished\r\nbefore the following census (1900) would have to be begun. He knew\r\nthat cards with patterns of holes had been used in weaving patterns\r\nin cloth. He realized that the presence or absence of a property, for\r\nexample employed or unemployed, could be represented by the presence\r\nor absence of a hole in a piece of paper. An electrical device could\r\ndetect the hole, he believed, since it would allow current to flow\r\nthrough, whereas the absence of the hole would stop the current. He\r\nexperimented with sorting and counting, using punched holes in cards,\r\nand with electrical devices to detect the holes and count them. A\r\ndefinite meaning was given to each place in the card where a hole might\r\nbe punched. Then electrical devices handled the particular information\r\nthat the punches represented. These devices either counted or added,\r\nsingly or in various combinations, as might be desired.\r\n\r\nMore than 50 years of development of punch-card calculating machinery\r\nhave since then taken place. Several large companies have made\r\nquantities of punch-card machines. A great degree of development has\r\ntaken place in the punch-card machines of International Business\r\nMachines Corporation (IBM), and for this reason these machines will\r\nbe the ones described in this chapter. What is said here, however,\r\nmay also in many ways apply to punch-card machines made by other\r\nmanufacturers—Remington-Rand, Powers, Control Instrument, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL PRINCIPLES\r\n\r\nTo use punch-card machines, we first convert the original information\r\ninto patterns of holes in cards. Then we feed the cards into the\r\nmachines. Electrical impulses read the pattern of holes and convert\r\nthem into a pattern of timed electrical currents. Actually, the\r\nreading of a hole in a column of a punch card is done by a brush of\r\nseveral strands of copper wire pressed against a metal roller (Fig.\r\n1). The machine feeds the card (the bottom edge first, where the 9’s\r\nare printed) with very careful timing over the roller; and, when the\r\npunched hole is between the brush and the roller, an electrical circuit\r\nbelonging to that column of the card is completed. The machine responds\r\naccording to its general design and its wiring for the particular\r\nproblem: it punches new cards, or it prints new marks, or it puts\r\ninformation into new storage places. Clerks, however, move the cards\r\nfrom one machine to another. They wait on the machines, keep the card\r\nfeeds full, and empty the card hoppers as they fill up. A human error\r\nof putting the wrong block of cards into a machine may from time to\r\ntime cause a little trouble, especially in sorting. Actually, in a\r\nyear, billions of punch cards are handled precisely.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1. Reading of punch cards.]\r\n\r\nThe _punch card_ is a masterpiece of engineering and standardization.\r\nIts exact thickness matches the knife-blade edges that feed the cards\r\ninto slots in the machines, and matches the channels whereby these\r\ncards travel through the machines. The standard card is 7⅜ inches long\r\nand 3¼ inches wide, and it has a standard thickness of 0.0065 inch and\r\nother standard properties with respect to stiffness, finish, etc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2. Scheme of standard punch card. (Note: Positions\r\n11 and 12 are not usually marked by printed numbers or letters.)]\r\n\r\nThe standard IBM punch card of today has 80 _columns_ and 12\r\n_positions_ for punching in each column (Fig. 2). A single punched\r\nhole in each of the positions known as 0 to 9 stands for each of the\r\ndigits 0 to 9 respectively. The remaining 2 single punch positions\r\navailable in any column are usually called the _11 position_ and _12\r\nposition_ (though sometimes called the numerical _X position_ and _Y\r\nposition_). These two positions do not behave arithmetically as 11 and\r\n12. Actually, in the space between one card and the next card as they\r\nare fed through the machines, more positions occur. For example, there\r\nmay be 4 more: a 10 position preceding the 9, and a 13, a 14, and a\r\n15 position following the 12. The 16 positions in total correspond to\r\na full turn, 360°, of the roller under the brush, and to a complete\r\n_cycle_ in the machine; and a single position corresponds to ¹/₁₆ of\r\n360°, or 22½°. In some machines, the total number of positions may be\r\n20. A pair of punches stands for each of the letters of the alphabet,\r\naccording to the scheme shown.\r\n\r\n    A    12-1        J    11-1     Unused  0-1\r\n    B    12-2        K    11-2        S    0-2\r\n    C    12-3        L    11-3        T    0-3\r\n    D    12-4        M    11-4        U    0-4\r\n    E    12-5        N    11-5        V    0-5\r\n    F    12-6        O    11-6        W    0-6\r\n    G    12-7        P    11-7        X    0-7\r\n    H    12-8        Q    11-8        Y    0-8\r\n    I    12-9        R    11-9        Z    0-9\r\n\r\nFor example, the word MASON is shown punched in Fig. 3.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3. Alphabetic punching.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4. Single-panel plugboard.]\r\n\r\nTo increase the versatility of the machines and provide them with\r\ninstructions, many of them have _plugboards_ (Fig. 4). These are\r\nstandard interchangeable boards filled with prongs on one side and\r\nholes or terminals called _hubs_ on the other side. The side with the\r\nprongs connects to the ends of electrical circuits in the punch-card\r\nmachine, which are brought together in one place for the purpose.\r\nOn the other side of the board, using plugwires, we can connect the\r\nhubs to each other in different ways to produce different results.\r\nThe single-panel plugboard is 10 inches long and 5¾ inches wide. It\r\ncontains 660 hubs in front and 660 corresponding prongs in the back.\r\nA double-panel plugboard or a triple-panel plugboard applies to some\r\nmachines. In less time than it takes to describe it, we can take one\r\nwired-up plugboard out of a machine and put in a new wired-up plugboard\r\nand thus change completely the instructions under which the machine\r\noperates. Many of the machines have a number of different switches that\r\nwe must also change, when going from one kind of problem to another.\r\n\r\nThe numbers that are stored or sorted in punch-card machines may be\r\nof any size up to 80 digits, one in each column of the punch card. In\r\ndoing arithmetic (adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing),\r\nhowever, the largest number of digits is usually 10. Beyond 10 digits,\r\nwe can work out tricks in many cases.\r\n\r\n\r\nTYPES OF PUNCH-CARD MACHINES\r\n\r\nThe chief IBM punch-card machines are: the _key punch_, the _verifier_,\r\nthe _sorter_, the _interpreter_, the _reproducer_, the _collator_, the\r\n_multiplying punch_, the _calculating punch_, and the _tabulator_. Of\r\nthese 9 machines, the last 6 have plugboards and can do many different\r\noperations as a result.\r\n\r\nThere is a flow of punch cards through each of these machines. The\r\nmachines differ from each other in the number and relation of the\r\npaths of flow, or _card channels_, and in the number and relation of\r\nthe momentary stopping places, or _card stations_, at which cards are\r\nread, punched, or otherwise acted on. We can get a good idea of what a\r\nmachine is from a picture of these card channels.\r\n\r\n\r\nKey Punch\r\n\r\nWe use a key punch (Fig. 5) to punch original information into\r\nblank cards. In the key punch there is one card channel; it has one\r\nentrance, one station, and one exit. At the card station, there are\r\n12 _punching dies_, one for each position in the card column, and\r\neach card column is presented one by one for punching. The numeric\r\n_keyboard_ (Fig. 6) for the key punch has 14 keys:\r\n\r\n    One key for each of the\r\n      punches 0 to 9, 11, and 12,\r\n\r\n    A _space key_, which allows a\r\n      column of the punch card to\r\n      go by with no punch in it,\r\n\r\n    A _release key_, which ejects the\r\n      card and feeds another card.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5. Key punch.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6. Keyboard of key punch.]\r\n\r\nOf course, in using a key punch, we must punch the same kind of\r\ninformation in the same group of columns. For example, if these cards\r\nare to contain employees’ social security numbers, we must punch that\r\nnumber always in the same card columns, numbered, say, 15 to 23, or 70\r\nto 78, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nVerifier\r\n\r\nThe verifier is really the same machine as the key punch, but it has\r\ndull punching dies moving gently instead of sharp ones moving with\r\nforce. It turns on a red light and stops when there is no punched hole\r\nin the right spot to match with a pressed key.\r\n\r\n\r\nSorter\r\n\r\nThe sorter is a machine for sorting cards, one column at a time (Fig.\r\n7). The sorter has a card channel that forks; it has one entrance,\r\none station, and 13 exits. Each exit corresponds to: one of the 12\r\npunch positions 0 to 9, 11, and 12; or _reject_, which applies when the\r\ncolumn is nowhere punched. It has one card station where a brush reads\r\na single column of the card. We can turn a handle and move the brush to\r\nany column.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7. Sorter.]\r\n\r\n\r\nInterpreter\r\n\r\nThe interpreter takes in a card, reads its punches, prints on the card\r\nthe marks indicated by the punches, and stacks the card. We call this\r\nprocess _interpreting_ the card, since it translates the punched holes\r\ninto printed marks. The interpreter (Fig. 8) has one card channel, with\r\none entrance, 2 card stations, and one exit. What the machine does at\r\nthe second card station depends on what the machine reads at the first\r\ncard station and on what we have told the machine by switches and\r\nplugboard wiring to do.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8. Interpreter.]\r\n\r\n\r\nReproducer\r\n\r\nThe reproducer or reproducing punch can:\r\n\r\n    _Reproduce_, or copy the punches in one group of\r\n        cards into another group of cards (in the same or\r\n        different columns).\r\n\r\n    _Compare_, or make sure that the punches in two\r\n         groups of cards agree (and shine a red light if\r\n         they do not).\r\n\r\n    _Gang punch_, or copy the punches in a _master card_\r\n         into a group of _detail cards_.\r\n\r\n    _Summary punch_, or copy totals or summaries obtained\r\n         in the tabulator into blank cards in the reproducer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9. Reproducer.]\r\n\r\nThe reproducer (Fig. 9) has 2 independent card channels, the cards not\r\nmingling in any way, called the _reading channel_ and the _punching\r\nchannel_. We can run the machine with only the punching channel\r\nworking; in fact, IBM equips some models only with the punching\r\nchannel, particularly for “summary punch” operation. The machine\r\nis timed so that, when any card is at the middle station in either\r\nchannel, then the next preceding card is at the latest station, and\r\nthe next following card is at the earliest station. At 5 stations, the\r\nmachine reads a card. At the middle station of the punching channel,\r\nthe machine punches a card. Using a many-wire cable, we can connect\r\nthe tabulator to the reproducer and so cause the tabulator to give\r\ninformation electrically to the reproducer. This connection makes\r\npossible the “summary punch” operation. Here is an instance with\r\npunch-card machines where, in order to transfer information from one\r\nmachine to another, we are not required to move cards physically from\r\none machine to another.\r\n\r\n\r\nCollator\r\n\r\nThe collator is a machine that arranges or _collates_ cards. It is\r\nparticularly useful in selecting, matching, and merging cards. The\r\ncollator (Fig. 10) has 2 card channels which join and then fork into 4\r\nchannels ending in pockets called _Hoppers_ 1, 2, 3, and 4. The 2 card\r\nfeeds are called the _Primary Feed_ and the _Secondary Feed_. Cards\r\nfrom the Primary Feed may fall only into the first and second hoppers.\r\nCards from the Secondary Feed may fall only into the second, third, and\r\nfourth hoppers. The collator has 3 stations at which cards may be read.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: No.1--Selected primaries\r\n\r\nNo.2--Merged cards and unselected primaries\r\n\r\nNo.3--Separate secondaries not selected\r\n\r\nNo.4--Selected secondaries\r\n\r\nFIG. 10. Collator.]\r\n\r\nIBM can supply additional wiring called the _collator counting device_.\r\nWith this we can make the collator count cards as well as compare them.\r\nFor example, we could put 12 blank cards from the Secondary Feed behind\r\neach punched-card from the Primary Feed in order to prepare for some\r\nother operation.\r\n\r\n\r\nCalculating Punch\r\n\r\nThe calculating punch was introduced in 1946. It is a versatile machine\r\nof considerable capacity. It adds, subtracts, multiplies, and divides.\r\nIt also has a control over a sequence of operations, in some cases up\r\nto half a dozen steps.\r\n\r\nThis machine (Fig. 11) has one card channel with 4 stations called,\r\nrespectively, _control brushes_, _reading brushes_, _punch feed_, and\r\n_punching dies_. At station 1, there are 20 brushes; we can set these\r\nby hand to read any 20 of the 80 card columns. At station 2 there are\r\n80 regular reading brushes. At station 3 the card waits for a part\r\nof a second while the machine calculates, and, when that is done,\r\nthe card is fed into station 4, where it is punched or verified. The\r\nmultiplying punch is an earlier model of the calculating punch, without\r\nthe capacity for division.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11. Calculating punch.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTabulator\r\n\r\nThe tabulator can select and list information from cards. Also, it can\r\ntotal information from groups of cards in _counters_ of the tabulator\r\nand can print the totals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12. Tabulator.]\r\n\r\nThe tabulator (Fig. 12) has one card channel with two stations where\r\ncards may be read, called the _Upper Brushes_ and _Lower Brushes_.\r\nWhen the Lower Brush station is reading one card, the Upper Brush\r\nstation is reading the next card. The tabulator also has another\r\nchannel, which is for endless paper (and sometimes separate sheets or\r\ncards). This channel has one station; here printing takes place. Unlike\r\nthe typewriter, the tabulator prints a whole row at a time. It can\r\nprint up to 88 numerals or letters across the sheet in one stroke. The\r\ncards flowing through the card channel and the paper flowing through\r\nthe paper channel do not have to move in step; in fact, we need many\r\ndifferent time relations between them, and the number of rows printed\r\non the paper may have almost any relation to the number of punch cards\r\nflowing through the card channel.\r\n\r\nAt the station where paper is printed, we can put on the machine a\r\nmechanism called the _automatic carriage_. This is like a typewriter\r\ncarriage, which holds the paper for a typewriter, but we can control\r\nthe movement of paper through the automatic carriage by plugboard\r\nwiring, switch settings, and holes in punch cards. Thus we can arrange\r\nfor headings, spacing, and feeding of new sheets to be controlled by\r\nthe information and the instructions, with a great deal of versatility.\r\n\r\n\r\nHANDLING INFORMATION\r\n\r\nWe have now described briefly the chief available punch-card machines\r\nas of the middle of 1948. The next question is: How do we actually get\r\nsomething done by means of punch cards? Let us go back to the census\r\nexample, even though it may not be a very typical example, and see what\r\nwould be done if we wished to compile a census by punch cards.\r\n\r\nThe first thing we do is plan which columns of the punch card will\r\ncontain what information about the people being counted. For example,\r\nthe following might be part of the plan:\r\n\r\n                         NO. OF\r\n     INFORMATION      POSSIBILITIES   COLUMNS\r\n    State                    60          1- 2\r\n    County                1,000          3- 5\r\n    Township             10,000          6- 9\r\n    City or village      10,000         10-13\r\n    Sex                       2            14\r\n    Age last birthday       100         15-16\r\n    Occupation          100,000         17-21\r\n    ...                   ...            ...\r\n\r\nUnder the heading state, we know that there are 48 states, the District\r\nof Columbia, and several territories and possessions—all told, perhaps\r\n60 possibilities. So, 2 punch-card columns are enough: they will allow\r\n100 different sets of punches from 00 to 99 to be put in them. We then\r\nassign the _code_ 00 to Maine, 01 to New Hampshire, 02 to Vermont,\r\netc., or we might assign the code 00 to Alabama, 01 to Arizona, 02\r\nto Arkansas, etc.—whichever would be more useful. Under the other\r\nheadings, we do the same thing: count the possibilities; assign codes.\r\nIn this case, it will be reasonable to use numeric codes 0 to 9 in each\r\ncolumn in all places because we shall have millions of cards to deal\r\nwith and numeric codes can be sorted faster than alphabetic codes.\r\nAlphabetic codes require 2 punched holes in each column, and sorting\r\nany column takes 2 operations.\r\n\r\nThe punch cards are printed with the chosen headings. We set up\r\nthe codes in charts and give them to clerks. Using key punches and\r\nverifiers, they punch up the cards and check them. They work from the\r\noriginal information collected by the census-taker in the field. Since\r\nthe original information will come in geographically, probably only one\r\ngeographic code at a time will be needed, and it will be simple to keep\r\ntrack of. As to occupation, however, it may be useful to assign other\r\nclerks full-time to examining the original information and specifying\r\nthe right code for the occupation. Then the clerks who do the punching\r\nwill have only copying to do.\r\n\r\nThe great bulk of the work with the census will be sorting, counting,\r\nand totaling. The original punch cards will be summarized into larger\r\nand larger groups. For example, the cards for all males age 23 last\r\nbirthday living in the state of Massachusetts are sorted together. This\r\ngroup of cards may be put into a tabulator wired to a summary punch.\r\nWhen the tabulator has counted the last card of this group, the summary\r\npunch punches one card, showing the total number in this group. Some\r\ntime later a card like this will be ready for every state. Then the\r\nwhole group of state cards may be fed into the tabulator wired to the\r\nreproducer acting as summary punch. When totaled, the number of males\r\nage 23 last birthday in the United States will be punched into a single\r\ncard. After more compiling, a card like this will be ready for all\r\nmales in the United States at each age. Then this group of cards may\r\nbe fed into the tabulator wired to the summary punch. Each card may\r\nbe listed by the tabulator on the paper flowing through it, showing\r\nthe age and the number of males living at that age. At the end of the\r\nlisting, the tabulator will print the total number of all males in the\r\nlist, and the summary punch will punch a card containing this total.\r\n\r\n\r\nARITHMETICAL OPERATIONS\r\n\r\nPunch-card machines can perform the arithmetical operations of\r\ncounting, adding, subtracting, multiplying, dividing, and rounding off.\r\n\r\n\r\nCounting\r\n\r\nCounting can be done by the sorter, the tabulator, and the collator.\r\nThe tabulator can print the total count. The tabulator and summary\r\npunch wired together can put the total count automatically into another\r\npunch card. The sorter shows the count in dials.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdding and Subtracting\r\n\r\nAdding and subtracting can be done by the tabulator, the calculating\r\npunch, and the multiplying punch. In the calculating and multiplying\r\npunches, the sum or difference is usually punched into the same card\r\nfrom which the numbers were first obtained. The tabulator, however,\r\nobtains the result first in a counter; from the counter, it can be\r\nprinted on paper or punched into a blank card with the aid of the\r\nsummary punch.\r\n\r\nNumbers are handled as groups of decimal digits, and the machines\r\nmirror the properties of digits in the decimal system. Negative numbers\r\nare usually handled as _complements_ (see Supplement 2). For example,\r\nif we have in the tabulator a counter with a capacity of six digits,\r\nthe number-000013 is stored in the counter as the complement 999987.\r\nWe cannot store in the counter the number +999987, since we cannot\r\ndistinguish it from-000013. In other words, if a counter is to be used\r\nfor both positive and negative numbers, its capacity is actually one\r\ndigit less, since in the last decimal place on the left 0 will mean\r\npositive and 9 will mean negative.\r\n\r\n\r\nMultiplying and Dividing\r\n\r\nMultiplying is done in the calculating and multiplying punches. In\r\nboth cases, the multiplication table is built into the circuits of\r\nthe machine, and the system of _left-hand components_ and _right-hand\r\ncomponents_ is used (see Supplement 2).\r\n\r\nDividing is done in the calculating punch and is carried out in that\r\nmachine much as in ordinary arithmetic. By means of an estimating\r\ncircuit the calculating punch guesses what multiple of the divisor will\r\ngo into the dividend. Then it determines that multiple and tries it.\r\n\r\n\r\nRounding Off\r\n\r\nRounding off may be done in 3 punch-card machines, the calculating\r\nand multiplying punches, and the tabulator. For example, suppose we\r\nhave the numbers 49.1476, 68.5327, and we wish to round them off to\r\n2 decimal places. The results will be 49.15 and 68.53. For the first\r\nnumber, we raise the .0076, turning .1476 into .15, since .0076 is more\r\nthan .005. For the second number, we drop the .0027 since it is less\r\nthan .005.\r\n\r\nEach of these punch-card machines provides what is called a _5 impulse_\r\nin each machine cycle. When the number is to be rounded off, the 5\r\nimpulse is plugged into the first decimal place that is to be dropped,\r\nand it is there added. If the figure in the decimal place to be dropped\r\nis 0 to 4, the added 5 makes no difference in the last decimal place\r\nthat is to be kept. But, if the figure in the decimal place to be\r\ndropped is 5 to 9, then the added 5 makes a carry into the last decimal\r\nplace that is to be kept, increasing it by 1, and this is just what is\r\nwanted for rounding off.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOGICAL OPERATIONS\r\n\r\nPunch-card machines do many operations of reasoning or logic that do\r\nnot involve addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division. Just\r\nas we can write equations for arithmetical operations, so we can write\r\nequations for these logical operations using mathematical logic (see\r\nChapter 9 and Supplement 2). If any reader, however, is not interested\r\nin these logical equations, he should skip each paragraph that begins\r\nwith “in the language of logic,” or a similar phrase.\r\n\r\n\r\nTranslating\r\n\r\nReading and writing are operations perhaps not strictly of reasoning\r\nbut of _translating_ from one language to another. Basically these\r\noperations take in a mark in one language and give out a mark with the\r\nsame meaning in another language. For example, the interpreter takes in\r\npunched holes and gives out printed marks, but the holes and the marks\r\nhave the same meaning.\r\n\r\nThe major part of sorting is done by a punch-card sorting machine and\r\ncan be considered an operation of translating. In sorting a card, the\r\nmachine takes in a mark in the form of a punched hole on a punch card\r\nand specifies a place bearing the same mark where the card is put. The\r\nremaining part of sorting is done by human beings. This part consists\r\nof picking up blocks of cards from the pockets of the sorter and\r\nputting the blocks together in the right sequence.\r\n\r\n\r\nComparing\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13. Comparer.]\r\n\r\nThe first operation of reasoning done by punch-card machines is\r\n_comparing_. For an example of comparing in the operation of the\r\ntabulator, let us take instructing the machine when to pick up a total\r\nand print it. As an illustration, suppose that we are making a table\r\nby state, county, and township of the number of persons counted in a\r\ncensus. Suppose that for each township we have one punch card telling\r\nthe total number of persons. If all the cards are in sequence, then,\r\nwhenever the county changes, we want a minor total, and, whenever the\r\nstate changes, we want a major total. What does the machine do?\r\n\r\nThe tabulator has a mechanism that we shall call a _comparer_ (Fig.\r\n13). A comparer has 2 inputs that may be called _Previous_ and\r\n_Current_ and one output that may be called _Unequal_. The comparer\r\nhas the property of giving out an impulse if and only if there is a\r\ndifference between the 2 inputs.\r\n\r\nIn the language of the algebra of logic (see Supplement 2 and Chapter\r\n9), let the pieces of information coming into the comparer be _a_ and\r\n_b_, and let the information coming out of the comparer be _p_. Then\r\nthe equation of the comparer is:\r\n\r\n    _p_ = _T_(_a_ ≠ _b_)\r\n\r\nwhere “_T_ (···)” is “the truth value of ···” and “···” is a statement,\r\nand where the truth value is 1 if true and 0 if false.\r\n\r\nIn wiring the tabulator so that it can tell when to total, we use the\r\ncomparer. We feed into it the county from the current card and the\r\ncounty from the previous card. Out of the comparer we get an impulse if\r\nand only if these two pieces of information are different. This is just\r\nwhat happens when the county changes. The impulse from the comparer is\r\nthen used in further wiring of the tabulator: it makes the counter that\r\nis busy totaling the number of persons in the county print its total\r\nand then clear. In the same way, another comparer, which watches state\r\ninstead of county, takes care of major totals when the state changes.\r\n\r\n\r\nSelecting\r\n\r\nThe next operation of reasoning which punch-card machines can do\r\nis _selecting_. The tabulator, collator, interpreter, reproducer,\r\nand calculating punch all may contain mechanisms that can select\r\ninformation. These mechanisms are called _selectors_.\r\n\r\nFor example, suppose that we are using the tabulator to make a table\r\nshowing for each city the number of males and the number of females.\r\nIn the table we shall have three columns: first, city; second, males;\r\nthird, females. Suppose that each punch card in columns 30 to 36 shows\r\nthe total of males or females in a city. Suppose that, if and only if\r\nthe card is for females, it has an X punch (or 11 punch) in column 79.\r\nWhat do we want to have happen? We want the number in columns 30 to 36\r\nto go into the second column of the table if there is no X in column\r\n79, and we want it to go into the third column of the table if there is\r\nan X in column 79. This is just another way of saying that we want the\r\nnumber to go into the males column if it is a number of males, and into\r\nthe females column if it is a number of females. We make this happen by\r\nusing a selector.\r\n\r\nA selector (Fig. 14) is a mechanism with 2 inputs and 2 outputs. The\r\n2 inputs are called _X Pickup_ and _Common_. The 2 outputs are called\r\n_X_ and _No X_. The X Pickup, as its name implies, watches for X’s.\r\nThe Common takes in information. What comes out of X is what goes into\r\nCommon if and only if an X punch is picked up; otherwise nothing comes\r\nout. What comes out of No X is what goes into Common if and only if an\r\nX punch is not picked up; otherwise nothing comes out. From the point\r\nof view of ordering punch-card equipment, we should note that there are\r\ntwo types of selectors: _X selectors_ or _X distributors_, which have a\r\nselecting capacity of one column—that is, one decimal digit—and _class\r\nselectors_, which ordinarily have a selecting capacity of 10 columns or\r\n10 decimal digits. But we shall disregard this difference here, as we\r\nhave disregarded most other questions of capacity in multiplication,\r\ndivision, etc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14. Selector.]\r\n\r\nIn the language of logic (see Chapter 9 and Supplement 2), if _p_,\r\n_a_, _b_, _c_ are the information in X Pickup, Common, X, and No X,\r\nrespectively, then the equations for a selector are:\r\n\r\n    _b_ = _a_·_p_\r\n\r\n    _c_ = _a_·(1 - _p_)\r\n\r\nReturning now to the table we wish to make, we connect columns 30 to\r\n36 of the punch card to Common. We connect column 79 of the punch card\r\nto the X Pickup. We connect the output No X to the males column of the\r\ntable. We connect the output X to the females column of the table. In\r\nthis way we make the number in the punch card appear in either one of\r\ntwo places in the table according to whether the number counts males or\r\nfemales.\r\n\r\nWe might mention several more properties of selectors. A selector can\r\nbe used in the reverse way, with X Pickup, X, and No X as inputs and\r\nCommon as output (Fig. 15). What will come out of Common is (1) what\r\ngoes into input No X if there is no X punch in the column to which\r\ninput X Pickup is wired, and (2) what goes into input X if there is an\r\nX punch in the column to which input X Pickup is wired.\r\n\r\nIn this case the logical equation for the selector is:\r\n\r\n    _a_ = _bp_ + _c_(1 - _p_)\r\n\r\nAlso, selectors can be used one after another, so that selecting based\r\non 2 or 3 X punches can be made.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15. Selector.]\r\n\r\nIn the language of logic, if _p_, _q_, _r_ are the truth values of\r\n“there is an X punch in column _i_, _j_, _k_,” respectively, then by\r\nmeans of selectors we can get such a function as:\r\n\r\n    _c_ = _apq_ + _b_(1 - _q_)(1 - _r_)\r\n\r\nAlso, a selector may often be energized not only by an X punch but\r\nalso by a punch 0, 1, 2, ···, 9 and 12. In this case, the selector is\r\nequipped with an additional input that can respond to any digit. This\r\ninput is called the Digit Pickup.\r\n\r\n\r\nDigit Selector\r\n\r\nSomething like an ordinary selector is another mechanism called a\r\n_digit selector_ (Fig. 16). This has one input, Common, and 12 outputs,\r\n0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12. This mechanism is often included\r\nin the tabulator and may be included in other punch-card machines. For\r\nexample, suppose that we want to do something if and only if column 62\r\nof a punch card contains a 3 or a 4 or a 9. Then we connect a brush\r\nthat reads column 62 of the punch card to the Common input of the digit\r\nselector. And we connect out from the digit selector jointly from\r\noutputs 3, 4, and 9.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16. Digit selector.]\r\n\r\nIn the language of logic, if _a_ is the digit going into Common, and if\r\n_p_ is the impulse coming out of the digit selector, then the equation\r\nof the mechanism in this case is:\r\n\r\n    _p_ = _T_(_a_ = 3, 4, 9)\r\n\r\n\r\nSequencer\r\n\r\nA fourth operation of reasoning done by punch-card machines is finding\r\nthat one number is greater than, or equal to, or less than another.\r\nThis operation is done in the collator and may be called _sequencing_.\r\nFor example, suppose that we have a file of punch cards for cities,\r\nshowing in columns 41 to 48 the number of people. Suppose that we wish\r\nto pick out the cards for cities over 125,000 in population. Now the\r\ncollator has a mechanism that has 2 inputs and 3 outputs (Fig. 17). We\r\nmay call this mechanism a _sequencer_, since it can tell the sequence\r\nof two numbers. What goes into the _Primary_ input is a number: let us\r\ncall it _a_. What goes into _Secondary_ is another number: let us call\r\nit _b_. An impulse comes out of _Low Primary_ if _a_ is less than _b_.\r\nAn impulse comes out of _Equal_ if _a_ equals _b_. An impulse comes out\r\nof _Low Secondary_ if _a_ is greater than _b_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17. Sequencer.]\r\n\r\nIn the language of logic, if _p_, _q_, _r_ are the three indications in\r\nLow Primary, Equal, and Low Secondary, then:\r\n\r\n    _p_ = _T_(_a_ < _b_)\r\n\r\n    _q_ = _T_(_a_ = _b_)\r\n\r\n    _r_ = _T_(_a_ > _b_)\r\n\r\nReturning to our example, we punch up a card with 125,000 in columns 43\r\nto 48, and we put this card into the Secondary Feed. We take the punch\r\ncards for cities and put them into the Primary Feed. In the plugboard,\r\nwe connect the hubs of the Secondary Brushes (that read the card in\r\nthe Secondary Feed), columns 43 to 48, to the Secondary input of the\r\nSequencer. We connect the hubs of the Primary Brushes (that read the\r\ncard in the Primary Feed), columns 41 to 48, to the Primary input of\r\nthe Sequencer. Then we connect the Low Primary output of the Sequencer\r\nto a device that causes the city card being examined to fall into\r\npocket 1. We connect Equal output and Low Secondary output to a device\r\nthat causes the city card being examined to fall into pocket 2. Then,\r\nwhen the card for any city comes along, the machine compares the number\r\nof people in the city with 125,000. If the number is greater than\r\n125,000, the card will fall into pocket 1; otherwise the card will fall\r\ninto pocket 2. At the end of the run, we shall find in pocket 1 all the\r\ncards we want.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW DEVELOPMENTS\r\n\r\nWe may expect to see over the next few years major developments in\r\npunch-card machinery. It would seem likely that types of punch-card\r\nmachines like the following might be constructed:\r\n\r\n    A punch-card machine that performs any arithmetical or\r\n      logical operation at high speed and may perform a dozen\r\n      such operations in sequence during the time that a punch\r\n      card passes through the machine.\r\n\r\n    A punch-card machine that uses loops of punched paper\r\n      tape, which express either a sequence of values in a table\r\n      that the machine can consult or a sequence of instructions\r\n      that govern the operations of the machine.\r\n\r\n    Punch-card machinery that uses a larger card than the\r\n      80-column card.\r\n\r\n    A punch-card machine that may have a fairly large amount\r\n      of internal memory, perhaps 30 or 40 registers where\r\n      numbers or words may be stored and referred to.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPEED\r\n\r\nThe speed of various operations with present IBM punch-card machines is\r\nabout as shown in the table.\r\n\r\n       MACHINE             OPERATION                     TIME IN SECONDS\r\n    Key punch          Punch 80 columns                   About 20 to 40\r\n    Verifier           Check 80 columns                   About 20 to 40\r\n    Sorter             Sort 1 card on 1 column                 0.15\r\n    Interpreter        Print 1 line                            0.8\r\n    Reproducer         Reproduce a card, all 80 columns        0.6\r\n    Collator           Merge 2 cards                           0.25\r\n    Multiplying punch  Multiply by 8 digits                    5.6\r\n    Calculating punch  Add                                     0.3\r\n    Calculating punch  Multiply by 8 digits                    3.6\r\n    Calculating punch  Divide, obtaining 8 quotient digits     9.0\r\n    Tabulator          Print 1 line, numbers only              0.4\r\n    Tabulator          Print 1 line, letters included          0.75\r\n    Tabulator          Add numbers from 1 card                 0.4\r\n\r\n\r\nCOST\r\n\r\nPunch-card machines may be either rented or purchased from some\r\nmanufacturers but only rented from others. If we take the cost of a\r\nclerk as $120 to $150 a month, the monthly rent of most punch-card\r\nmachines ranges from ⅒ of the cost of a clerk for the simplest type\r\nof machine, such as a key punch, to 3 times the cost of a clerk for a\r\ncomplicated and versatile type of machine, such as a tabulator with\r\nmany attachments. The rental basis is naturally convenient for many\r\nkinds of jobs.\r\n\r\n\r\nRELIABILITY\r\n\r\nThe reliability of work with punch cards and punch-card machines is\r\noften much better than 99 per cent: in 10,000 operations, failures\r\nshould be less than 2 or 3. This is, of course, much better than with\r\nclerical operations.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of causes for machine or card failures. Sometimes\r\ncards may be warped and may not feed into the machines properly. Or,\r\nthe air in the room may be very dry, and static electricity may make\r\nthe cards stick together. Or, the air may be too humid; the cards may\r\nswell slightly and may jam in the machine. A punch may get slightly\r\nout of true alignment, and punches in the cards may be slightly off. A\r\nrelay may get dust on its contact points and, from time to time, fail\r\nto perform in the right way. Considerable engineering effort has been\r\nput into remedying these and other troubles, with much success.\r\n\r\nTo make sure that we have correct results from human beings working\r\nwith punch-card machines, we may verify each process. Information\r\nthat is punched on the key punch may be verified on the verifier.\r\nMultiplications done with multiplicand _a_ and multiplier _b_ may be\r\nrepeated and compared with multiplications done with multiplicand _b_\r\nand multiplier _a_. Cards that are sorted on the sorter may be put\r\nthrough the collator to make sure that their sequence is correct. It\r\nis often good to plan every operation so that we have a proof that the\r\nresult is right.\r\n\r\nIt is standard practice to have the machines inspected regularly in\r\norder to keep them operating properly. On the average, for every 50 to\r\n75 machines, there will be one full-time service man maintaining them\r\nand taking care of calls for repairs. Of course, as with any machinery,\r\nsome service calls will be a result of the human element; for example,\r\na problem may have been set up wrongly on a machine.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL USEFULNESS\r\n\r\nPunch-card calculations are much faster and more accurate than hand\r\ncalculations. With punch cards, work is organized so that all cases\r\nare handled at the same time in the same way. This process is very\r\ndifferent from handling each case separately from start to finish. As\r\nsoon as the number of cases to be handled is more than a hundred and\r\neach item of information is to be used five or more times, punch cards\r\nare likely to be advantageous, provided other factors are favorable.\r\nVast quantities of information have been handled very successfully by\r\npunch-card machines. Over 30 scientific and engineering laboratories in\r\nthe United States are doing computation by punch cards. Over a billion\r\npunch cards, in fact, are used annually in this country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 5\r\n\r\nMEASURING:\r\n\r\nMASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY’S\r\n\r\nDIFFERENTIAL ANALYZER NO. 2\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the previous chapter we talked about machines that move information\r\nexpressed as holes in cards. In this chapter we shall talk about\r\nmachines that move information expressed as measurements.\r\n\r\n\r\nANALOGUE MACHINES\r\n\r\nA simple example of a device that uses a measurement to handle\r\ninformation is a doorpost. Here the height of a child may be marked\r\nfrom year to year as he grows (Fig. 1). Or, suppose that we have a\r\nglobe of the world and wish to find the shortest path between Chicago\r\nand Moscow. We may lay a piece of string on the globe, pull it tight\r\nbetween those points, and then measure the string on a scale to see\r\nabout what distance it shows (Fig. 2).\r\n\r\nMachines that handle information as measurements of physical quantities\r\nare called _analogue_ machines, because the measurement is _analogous_\r\nto, or like, the information. A common example of analogue machine\r\nis the _slide rule_. With this we calculate by noting the positions\r\nof ruled lines on strips that slide by each other. These strips are\r\nmade of fine wood, or of plastic, or of steel, in such fashion that\r\nthe ruled lines will hold true positions and not warp. If we space\r\nthe rulings so that 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 ··· are equally spaced, then the\r\nslide rule is useful for addition (Fig. 3). But if we space the rulings\r\nso that _powers_ (for example, powers of two—1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 ···)\r\n(Fig. 4) are equally spaced, we can do multiplication. The spacings\r\nare then according to the _logarithms_ of numbers (see Supplement 2).\r\nMultiplication is more troublesome than addition, and so more slide\r\nrules are made for multiplication than for addition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1. Measurement by doorpost.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2. Measurement by string.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3. Slide Rule for adding.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4. Slide Rule for multiplying.]\r\n\r\nDuring World War II, the aiming and firing of guns against hostile\r\nplanes was done by machine. After sighting a plane, these machines\r\nautomatically calculated how to direct fire against it. They were\r\nmuch better and faster than any man. These _fire-control instruments_\r\nwere analogue machines with steel and electrical parts built to fine\r\ntolerances. With care we can get accuracy of 1 part in 10,000 with\r\nanalogue machines, but greater accuracy is very hard to get.\r\n\r\n\r\nPHYSICAL QUANTITIES\r\n\r\nSuppose that we wish to make an analogue machine. We need to represent\r\ninformation by a measurement of something. What should we select?\r\nWhat physical thing to be measured should we choose to put into the\r\nmachine? Different amounts of this _physical quantity_ will match with\r\ndifferent amounts of the measurement being expressed. In the case of\r\nthe doorpost, the string, and the slide rule, the physical quantity\r\nis distance. In many fire-control instruments, the physical quantity\r\nis the _amount of turning of a shaft_ (Fig. 5). Many other physical\r\nquantities have from time to time been used in analogue machines,\r\nsuch as electrical measurements. The speedometer of an automobile\r\ntells distance traveled and speed. It is an analogue machine. It uses\r\nthe amount of turning of a wheel, and some electrical properties.\r\nIt handles information by means of measurements. The basic physical\r\nquantity that it measures is the amount of turning of a shaft.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5. Measurement by amount of turning of a shaft.]\r\n\r\n\r\nDIFFERENTIAL ANALYZER\r\n\r\nThe biggest and cleverest mechanical brain of the analogue type which\r\nhas yet been built is the _differential analyzer_ finished in 1942\r\nat Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, Mass. The\r\nfundamental physical quantity used in this machine is the amount of\r\nturning of a shaft. The name _analyzer_ means an apparatus or machine\r\nfor analyzing or solving problems. It happens that the word “analyzer”\r\nhas been used rather more often in connection with analogue machines,\r\nand so in many cases the word “analyzer” carries the meaning “analogue”\r\nas well. The word “differential” in the phrase “differential analyzer”\r\nrefers to the main purpose of the machine: it is specially adapted for\r\nsolving problems involving _differential equations_. Now what is a\r\ndifferential equation?\r\n\r\n\r\nDIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS\r\n\r\nIn order to explain what a differential equation is, we need to use\r\ncertain ideas. These ideas are: _equation_; _formula_; _function_;\r\n_rate of change_; _interval_; _derivative_; and _integral_. In the\r\nnext few paragraphs, we shall introduce these ideas briefly, with\r\nsome explanation and examples. It is entirely possible for anyone to\r\nunderstand these ideas rather easily, by collecting true statements\r\nabout them; no one should feel that because these ideas may be new they\r\ncannot be understood readily.\r\n\r\n\r\nPHYSICAL PROBLEMS\r\n\r\nIn physics, chemistry, mechanics, and other sciences there are many\r\nproblems in which the behavior of distance, of time, of speed, heat,\r\nvolume, electrical current, weight, acceleration, pressure, and many\r\nother _physical quantities_ are related to each other. Examples of such\r\nproblems are:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6. Paths of a shot from a gun, trajectories.]\r\n\r\n    What are the various angles to which a gun should be raised\r\n    in order that it may shoot various distances? (See Fig. 6.)\r\n    (The paths of a shot from a gun are called _trajectories_.)\r\n\r\n    If a plane flies in a direction always at the same angle from\r\n    the north, how much farther will it travel than if it flew\r\n    along the shortest path? (See Fig. 7.) (A path always at the same\r\n    angle from the north is called a _loxodrome_, and a shortest\r\n    path on a globe is called a _great circle_.)\r\n\r\n    How should an engine be designed so that it will have the least\r\n    vibration when it moves fast?\r\n\r\nIn _physical problems_ like these, the answer is not a single number\r\nbut a _formula_. What we want to do in any one of these problems is\r\nfind a formula so that any one of the quantities may be calculated,\r\ngiven the behavior of the others. For example, here is a familiar\r\nproblem in which the answer is a formula and not a number:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7. Paths of a flight.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8. Room formulas.]\r\n\r\n    How are the floor area of a room, its length,\r\n    and its width related to each other? (See Fig. 8.)\r\n\r\nThe answer is told in any one of three _equations_:\r\n\r\n\r\n    (_floor area_) EQUALS (_length_) TIMES (_width_)\r\n\r\n    (_length_) EQUALS (_floor area_) DIVIDED BY (_width_)\r\n\r\n    (_width_) EQUALS (_floor area_) DIVIDED BY (_length_)\r\n\r\nThe first equation shows that the floor area depends on the length of\r\nthe room and also on the width of the room. So we say floor area is a\r\n_function_ of length and width. This particular function happens to be\r\n_product_, the result of multiplication. In other words, floor area is\r\nequal to the product of length and width.\r\n\r\nNow there is another kind of function called a _differential function_\r\nor _derivative_. A _differential function_ or _derivative_ is an\r\n_instantaneous rate of change_. An instantaneous rate of change\r\nis the result of two steps: (1) finding a rate of change over an\r\n_interval_ and then (2) letting the interval become smaller and smaller\r\nindefinitely. For example, suppose that we have the problem:\r\n\r\n    How are speed, distance, and time related to each other?\r\n\r\nOne of the answers is:\r\n\r\n    (_speed_) EQUALS THE INSTANTANEOUS RATE OF CHANGE OF (_distance_)\r\n              WITH RESPECT TO (_time_)\r\n\r\nOr we can say, and it is just the same thing in other words:\r\n\r\n    (_speed_) EQUALS THE DERIVATIVE OF (_distance_)\r\n              WITH RESPECT TO (_time_)\r\n\r\nNow we can tell what a differential equation is. It is simply an\r\nequation in which a derivative occurs, such as the last example.\r\nPerhaps the commonest kind of equation in physical problems is the\r\ndifferential equation.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLVING PHYSICAL PROBLEMS\r\n\r\nNow we were able to change the equation about floor area into other\r\nforms, if we wanted to find length or width instead of floor area. When\r\nwe did this, we ran into the _inverse_ or opposite of multiplication:\r\ndivision.\r\n\r\nIn the same way, we can change the equation about speed into other\r\nforms, if we want to find distance or time instead of speed. If we\r\ndo this, we run into a new idea, the inverse or opposite of the\r\nderivative, called _integral_. The two new equations are:\r\n\r\n    (_distance_) EQUALS THE INTEGRAL OF (_speed_)\r\n                 WITH RESPECT TO (_time_)\r\n\r\n    (_time_) EQUALS THE INTEGRAL OF [ONE DIVIDED BY (_speed_)]\r\n             WITH RESPECT TO (_distance_)\r\n\r\nThese equations may also be called differential equations.\r\n\r\nAn integral is the result of a process called _integrating_. To\r\nintegrate speed and get distance is the result of three steps: (1)\r\nbreaking up an interval of time into a large number of small bits, (2)\r\nadding up all the small distances that we get by taking each bit of\r\ntime and multiplying by the speed which applied in that bit of time,\r\nand (3) letting the bits of time get smaller and smaller, and letting\r\nthe number of them get larger and larger, indefinitely.\r\n\r\nIn other words,\r\n\r\n    (_total distance_) EQUALS THE SUM OF ALL THE SMALL (_distances_),\r\n       EACH EQUAL TO: A BIT OF (_time_)\r\n       MULTIPLIED BY THE (_speed_) APPLYING TO THAT BIT\r\n\r\nThis is another way of saying as before,\r\n\r\n    (_distance_) EQUALS THE INTEGRAL OF (_speed_)\r\n                 WITH RESPECT TO (_time_)\r\n\r\nTo solve a differential equation, we almost always need to integrate\r\none or more quantities.\r\n\r\n\r\nORIGIN AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE DIFFERENTIAL ANALYZER\r\n\r\nFor at least two centuries, solving differential equations to answer\r\nphysical problems has been a main job for mathematicians. Mathematics\r\nis supposed to be logical, and perhaps you would think this would\r\nbe easy. But mathematicians have been unable to solve a great many\r\ndifferential equations; only here and there, as if by accident, could\r\nthey solve one. So they often wished for better methods in order to\r\nmake the job easier.\r\n\r\nA British mathematician and physicist, William Thomson (Lord Kelvin),\r\nin 1879 suggested solving differential equations by a machine. He went\r\nfurther: he described mechanisms for integrating and other mathematical\r\nprocesses, and how these mechanisms could be connected together in a\r\nmachine. No such machine was then built; engineering in those years\r\nwas not equal to it. In 1923, a machine of this type for solving the\r\ndifferential equations of trajectories was proposed by L. Wainwright.\r\n\r\nIn 1925, at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the problem of a\r\nmachine to solve differential equations was again being studied by Dr.\r\nVannevar Bush and his associates. Dr. Bush experimented with mechanisms\r\nthat would integrate, add, multiply, etc., and methods of connecting\r\nthem together in a machine. A major part of the success of the machine\r\ndepended on a device whereby a very small turning force would do a\r\nrather large amount of work. He developed a way in which the small\r\nturning force, about as small as a puff of breath, could be used to\r\ntighten a string around a drum already turning with a considerable\r\nforce, and thus clutch the drum, bring in that force, and do the work\r\nthat needed to be done. You may have watched a ship being loaded, seen\r\na man coil a rope around a _winch_, and watched him swing a heavy load\r\ninto the air by a slight pull on the rope (Fig. 9). If so, you have\r\nseen this same principle at work. The turning force (or _torque_) that\r\npulls on the rope is greatly increased (or _amplified_) by such a\r\nmechanism, and so we call it a _torque amplifier_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9. Increasing turning force; winch, or torque\r\namplifier.]\r\n\r\nBy 1930, Dr. Bush and his group had finished the first differential\r\nanalyzer. It was entirely mechanical, having no electrical parts except\r\nthe motors. It was so successful that a number of engineering schools\r\nand manufacturing businesses have since then built other machines of\r\nthe Bush type. Each time, some improvements were made in accuracy and\r\ncapacity for solving problems. But, if you changed from one problem\r\nto another on this type of machine, you had to do a lot of work with\r\nscrewdrivers and wrenches. You had to undo old mechanical connections\r\nbetween shafts and set up new ones. Accordingly, in 1935, the men at\r\nMIT started designing a second differential analyzer. In this one you\r\ncould make all the connections electrically.\r\n\r\nMIT finished its second differential analyzer in 1942, but the fact\r\nwas not published during World War II, for the machine was put to work\r\non important military problems. In fact, a rumor spread and was never\r\ndenied that the machine was a white elephant and would not work. The\r\nmachine was officially announced in October 1945. It was the most\r\nadvanced and efficient differential analyzer ever built. We shall\r\ntalk chiefly about it for the rest of this chapter. A good technical\r\ndescription of this machine is in a paper, “A New Type of Differential\r\nAnalyzer,” by Vannevar Bush and Samuel H. Caldwell, published in the\r\n_Journal of the Franklin Institute_ for October 1945.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL ORGANIZATION OF MIT DIFFERENTIAL ANALYZER NO. 2\r\n\r\nA differential analyzer is basically made up of shafts that turn.\r\nWhen we set up the machine to solve a differential equation, we\r\nassign one shaft in the machine to each quantity referred to in the\r\nequation. It is the job of that shaft to keep track of that quantity.\r\nThe total amount of turning of that shaft at any time while the\r\nproblem is running measures the size of that quantity at that time.\r\nIf the quantity decreases, the shaft turns in the opposite direction.\r\nFor example, if we have speed, time, and distance in a differential\r\nequation, we label one shaft “speed,” another shaft “time,” and another\r\nshaft “distance.” If we wish, we may assign 10 turns of the “time”\r\nshaft to mean “one second,” 2 turns of the “distance” shaft to mean\r\n“one foot,” and 4 turns of the “speed” shaft to mean “one foot per\r\nsecond.” These are called _scale factors_. We could, however, use any\r\nother convenient units that we wished.\r\n\r\nBy just looking at a shaft or a wheel, we can tell what part of a\r\nfull turn it has made—a half, or a quarter, or some other part—but we\r\ncannot tell by looking how many full turns it has made. In the machine,\r\ntherefore, there are mechanisms that record not only full turns but\r\nalso tenths of turns. These are called _counters_. We can connect a\r\ncounter to any shaft. When we want to know some quantity that a shaft\r\nand counter are keeping track of, we read the counting mechanism.\r\n\r\nThe second differential analyzer, which MIT finished in 1942, went a\r\nstep further than any previous one. In this machine, a varying number\r\ncan be expressed either (1) mechanically as the amount of turning of\r\na shaft, or (2) electrically as the amount of two _voltages_ in a\r\npair of wires. The MIT men did this by means of a mechanism called an\r\n_angle-indicator_.\r\n\r\nAngle indicators have essentially three parts: a _transmitter_, a\r\n_receiver_, and switches. The transmitter (Fig. 10) can sense the exact\r\namount that a shaft has turned and give out a voltage in each of two\r\nwires which tells exactly how much the shaft has turned (Fig. 11). The\r\nreceiving device (Fig. 12), which has a motor, can take in the voltages\r\nin the two wires and drive a second shaft, making it turn in step with\r\nthe first shaft. By means of the switchboard (Fig. 13), the two wires\r\nfrom the transmitter of any angle-indicator can lead anywhere in the\r\nmachine and be connected to the receiver of any other angle indicator.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10. Scheme of angle-indicator transmitter.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11. Indication of angle.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12. Scheme of angle-indicator receiver.]\r\n\r\nIn a differential analyzer, we can connect the shafts together in many\r\ndifferent ways. For example, suppose that we want one shaft _b_ to\r\nturn twice as much as another shaft _a_. For this to happen we must\r\nhave a mechanism that will connect shaft _a_ to shaft _b_ and make\r\nshaft _b_ turn twice as much as shaft _a_. We can draw the scheme of\r\nthis mechanism in Fig. 14: a box, standing for any kind of simple or\r\ncomplicated mechanism; a line going into it, standing for input of\r\nthe quantity _a_; a line going out of it, standing for output of the\r\nquantity _b_; and a statement saying that _b_ equals 2_a_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13. Switchboard.]\r\n\r\nOne mechanism that will make shaft _b_ turn twice as much as shaft _a_\r\nis a _pair of gears_ such that: (1) they mesh together and (2) the gear\r\non shaft _a_ has twice as many teeth as the gear on shaft _b_ (Fig.\r\n15). On the mechanical differential analyzer that MIT finished in 1930,\r\na pair of gears was the mechanism actually used for doubling. To make\r\none shaft turn twice as much as another by this device, we would: go\r\nover to the machine with a screwdriver; pick out from a box two gears,\r\none with twice as many teeth as the other; slide them onto the shafts\r\nthat are to be connected; make the gears mesh together; and screw them\r\ntight on their shafts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14. Scheme of a doubling mechanism.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15. Example of a doubling mechanism.]\r\n\r\nOn the MIT differential analyzer No. 2, however, we are better off. A\r\nmuch more convenient device for doubling is used. We make use of: a\r\n_gearbox_ in whichthere are two shafts that may be geared so that one\r\nturns twice as much as the other, and two angle-indicator transmitters\r\nand receivers. Looking at the drawing (Fig. 16), we can see that: shaft\r\n_a_ drives shaft _c_ to turn in step, shaft _c_ drives shaft _d_ to\r\nturn twice as much, and shaft _d_ drives shaft _b_ to turn in step.\r\nHere we can accomplish doubling by closing the pairs of switches that\r\nconnect to the gearbox shafts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Angle indicators: T, transmitters, and R, receivers\r\n\r\nFIG. 16. Another example of a doubling mechanism.]\r\n\r\nAbove, we have talked about a mechanism with gears that would multiply\r\nthe amount of turning by the _constant ratio_ 2. But, of course, in a\r\ncalculation, any ratio, say 7.65, 3.142, ···, might be needed, not only\r\n2. In order to handle various constant ratios, gearboxes of two kinds\r\nare in differential analyzer No. 2. The first kind is a _one-digit\r\ngearbox_. It can be set to give any of 10 ratios, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, ···,\r\n1.0. The second kind is a _four-digit gearbox_. It can be set to give\r\nany one of more than 11 thousand ratios, 0.0000, 0.0001, 0.0002, ···,\r\n1.1109, 1.1110. We can thus multiply by constant ratios.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdders\r\n\r\nWe come now to a new mechanism, whose purpose is to add or subtract the\r\namount of turning of two shafts. It is called an _adder_. The scheme\r\nof it is shown in Fig. 17: an input shaft with amount of turning _a_,\r\nanother input shaft with amount of turning _b_, and an output shaft\r\nwith amount of turning _a_ + _b_. The adder essentially is another\r\nkind of gearbox, called a _differential gear assembly_. This name is\r\nconfusing: the word “differential” here has nothing to do with the\r\nword “differential” in “differential analyzer.” This mechanism is very\r\nclosely related to the “differential” in the rear axle of a motor car,\r\nwhich distributes a driving thrust from the motor to the two rear\r\nwheels of the car.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17. Scheme of an adder mechanism.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18. Example of an adding mechanism (differential\r\ngear assembly).]\r\n\r\nA type of differential gear assembly that will add is shown in Fig. 18.\r\nThis is a set of 5 gears _A_ to _E_. The 2 gears _A_ and _B_ are input\r\ngears. The amount of their turning is _a_ and _b_, respectively. They\r\nboth mesh with a third gear, _C_, free to turn, but the axis of _C_\r\nis fastened to the inside rim of a fourth, larger gear, _D_. Thus _D_\r\nis driven, and the amount of its turning is (_a_ + _b_)/2. This gear\r\nmeshes with a gear _E_ with half the number of teeth, and so the amount\r\nof turning of _E_ is _a_ + _b_.\r\n\r\nWe can subtract the turning of one shaft from the turning of another\r\nsimply by turning one of the input shafts in the opposite direction.\r\n\r\n\r\nIntegrators\r\n\r\nAnother mechanism in a differential analyzer, and the one that makes\r\nit worth while to build the machine, is called an _integrator_. This\r\nmechanism carries out the process of integrating, of adding up a very\r\nlarge number of small changing quantities. Figure 19 shows what an\r\nintegrator is. It has three chief parts: a _disc_, a little _wheel_,\r\nand a _screw_. The round disc turns horizontally on its vertical shaft.\r\nThe wheel rests on the disc and turns vertically on its horizontal\r\nshaft. The screw goes through the support of the disc; when the screw\r\nturns, it changes the distance between the edge of the wheel and the\r\ncenter of the disc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19. Mechanism of integrator.]\r\n\r\nNow let us watch this mechanism move. If the disc turns a little bit,\r\nthe wheel pressing on it must turn a little bit. If the screw turns a\r\nsmall amount, the distance between the edge of the wheel and the center\r\nof the disc changes. The amount that the wheel turns is doubled if its\r\ndistance from the center of the disc is doubled, and halved if that\r\ndistance is halved. So we see that:\r\n\r\n    (_the total amount that the wheel turns_) EQUALS\r\n       THE SUM OF ALL THE SMALL (_amounts of turning_),\r\n       EACH EQUAL TO: A BIT OF (_disc turning_)\r\n       MULTIPLIED BY THE (_distance from the center\r\n       of the disc to the edge of the wheel_) APPLYING\r\n       TO THAT BIT\r\n\r\nIf we look back at our discussion of integrating (p. 72), we see that\r\nthe capital words here are just the same as those used there. Thus we\r\nhave a mechanism that expresses integration:\r\n\r\n    (_the total amount that the wheel turns_) EQUALS THE INTEGRAL OF\r\n         (_the distance from the center of the disc to the wheel_)\r\n         WITH RESPECT TO (_the amount that the disc turns_)\r\n\r\nThe scheme of this mechanism is shown in Fig. 20.\r\n\r\nFor example, suppose that the screw measures the speed at which a car\r\ntravels and that the disc measures time. The wheel, consequently, will\r\nmeasure distance traveled by the car. The mechanism INTEGRATES speed\r\nwith respect to time and gives distance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20. Scheme of integrator.]\r\n\r\nThis mechanism is the device that Lord Kelvin talked about in 1879 and\r\nthat Dr. Bush made practical in 1925. The mechanical difficulty is to\r\nmake the friction between the disc and the wheel turn the wheel with\r\nenough force to do other work. In the second differential analyzer, the\r\nangle indicator set on the shaft of the wheel solves the problem very\r\nneatly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 21. Graph of air resistance coefficient.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFunction Tables\r\n\r\nThe behavior of some physical quantities can be described only by a\r\nseries of numbers or a graphic curve. For example, the _resistance_ or\r\n_drag_ of the air against a passing object is related to the speed of\r\nthe object in a rather complicated way. Part of the relation is called\r\nthe _drag coefficient_ or _resistance coefficient_; a rough graph of\r\nthis is shown in Fig. 21. This graph shows several interesting facts:\r\n(1) when the object is still, there is no air resistance; (2) as it\r\ntravels faster and faster, air resistance rapidly increases; (3) when\r\nthe object travels with the speed of sound, resistance is very great\r\nand increases enormously; (4) but, when the object starts traveling\r\nwith a speed about 20 per cent faster than sound, the drag coefficient\r\nbegins to decrease. This drawing or _graph_ shows in part how air\r\nresistance depends on speed of object; in other words, it shows the\r\ndrag coefficient as a _function_ of speed (see Supplement 2).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 22. Pointer following graph.]\r\n\r\nNow we need a way of putting any function we wish into a differential\r\nanalyzer. To do this, we use a mechanism called a _function table_. We\r\ndraw a careful graph of the function according to the scale we wish to\r\nuse, and we set the graph on the outside of a large drum (Fig. 22).\r\nFor example, we can put the resistance coefficient graph on the drum;\r\nthe speed (or _independent variable_) goes around the drum, and the\r\nresistance coefficient (or _dependent variable_) goes along the drum.\r\nThe machine slowly turns the drum, as may be called for by the problem.\r\nA girl sits at the function table and watches, turning a handwheel\r\nthat keeps the sighting circle of a pointer right over the graph. The\r\nturning of the handwheel puts the graphed function into the machine.\r\nInstead of employing a person, we can make one side of the graph black,\r\nleaving the other side white, and put in a _phototube_ (an electronic\r\ntube sensitive to amount of light) that will steer from pure black or\r\npure white to half and half (see Fig. 23).\r\n\r\nWe do not need many function tables to put in information, because we\r\ncan often use integrators in neat combinations to avoid them. We shall\r\nsay more about this possibility later.\r\n\r\nWe can also use a function table to put out information and to draw a\r\ngraph. To do so, we disconnect the handwheel; we connect the shaft of\r\nthe handwheel to the shaft that records the function we are interested\r\nin; we take out the pointer and put in a pen; and we put a blank sheet\r\nof graph paper around the drum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 23. Phototube following graph.]\r\n\r\nWe have now described the main parts of the second MIT differential\r\nanalyzer. They are the parts that handle numbers. We can now tell the\r\ncapacity of the differential analyzer by telling the number of main\r\nparts that it holds:\r\n\r\n    Shafts                About 130\r\n    One-digit gearboxes          12\r\n    Four-digit gearboxes         16\r\n    Adders                About  16\r\n    Integrators                  18\r\n    Function tables               3\r\n\r\nOn a simpler level, we can say that the machine holds these physical\r\nparts:\r\n\r\n    Miles of wire        About  200\r\n    Relays               About 3000\r\n    Motors               About  150\r\n    Electronic tubes     About 2000\r\n\r\n\r\nINSTRUCTING THE MIT DIFFERENTIAL ANALYZER NO. 2\r\n\r\nBesides the function tables for putting information into the machine,\r\nthere are three mechanisms that read punched paper tape. The three\r\ntapes are called the _A tape_, the _B tape_, and the _C tape_. From\r\nthese tapes the machine is set up to solve a problem.\r\n\r\nSuppose that we have decided how the machine is to solve a problem.\r\nSuppose that we know the number of integrators, adders, gearboxes,\r\netc., that must be used, and know how their inputs and outputs are\r\nto be connected. To carry out the solution, we now have to put the\r\ninstructions and numbers into the machine.\r\n\r\nThe _A_ tape contains instructions for connecting shafts in the\r\nmachine. Each instruction connects a certain output of one type\r\nof mechanism (adder, etc.) to a certain input of another type of\r\nmechanism. When the machine reads an instruction on this tape, it\r\nconnects electrically the transmitting angle-indicator of an output\r\nshaft to the receiving angle-indicator of another input shaft.\r\n\r\nNow the connecting part of the differential analyzer behaves as if\r\nit were very intelligent: it assigns an adder or an integrator or a\r\ngearbox, etc., to a new problem only if that mechanism is not busy. For\r\nexample, if a problem tape calls for adder 3 (in the list belonging to\r\nthe problem), the machine will assign the first adder that is not busy,\r\nperhaps adder 14 (in the machine), to do the work. Each time that adder\r\n3 (in the problem list) is called for in the _A_ tape, the machine\r\nremembers that adder 14 was chosen and assigns it over again. This\r\nability, of course, is very useful.\r\n\r\nThe _B_ tape contains the ratios at which the gearboxes are to be set.\r\nFor example, suppose that we want gearbox 4 (in the problem list) to\r\nchange its input by the ratio of 0.2573. The machine, after reading the\r\n_A_ tape, has assigned gearbox 11 (in the machine list). Then, when the\r\nmachine reads the _B_ tape, it sets the ratio in gearbox 11 to 0.2573.\r\n\r\nThe answer to a differential equation is different for different\r\nstarting conditions. For example, when we know speed and time and wish\r\nto find distance traveled and where we have arrived, we must know the\r\npoint at which we started. We therefore need to arrange the machine so\r\nthat we can put in different starting conditions (or different _initial\r\nconditions_, as the mathematician calls them).\r\n\r\nThe _C_ tape puts the initial conditions into the machine. For example,\r\nreading the _C_ tape for the problem, the machine finds that 3000\r\nshould, at the start of the problem, stand in counter 4. The machine\r\nthen reads the number at which counter 4 actually stands, say 6728.3.\r\nIt subtracts the two numbers and remembers the difference, -3728.3.\r\nAnd whenever the machine reads that counter later, finding, say, 9468.4\r\nin it, first the 3728.3 is subtracted, and then the answer 5740.1 is\r\nprinted.\r\n\r\n\r\nANSWERS\r\n\r\nInformation may come out of the machine in either one of two ways: in\r\nprinted numbers or in a graph. In fact, the same quantity may come out\r\nof the machine in both ways at the same time. To obtain a graph, we\r\nchange a function table from input to output, put a pen on it, and have\r\nit draw the graph.\r\n\r\nThe machine has 3 electric typewriters. The machine will take numerical\r\ninformation out of the counters at high speed even while they are\r\nturning, and it will put the information into relays. Then it will read\r\nfrom the relays into the typewriter keys one by one while they type\r\nfrom left to right across the page.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW THE DIFFERENTIAL ANALYZER CALCULATES\r\n\r\nUp to this point in this chapter, the author has tried to tell the\r\nstory of the differential analyzer in plain words. But for reading\r\nthis section, a little knowledge of calculus is necessary. (See also\r\nSupplement 2.) If you wish, skip this section, and go on to the next\r\none.\r\n\r\nWe have described how varying quantities, or _variables_, are operated\r\non in the machine in one way or another: adding, subtracting,\r\nmultiplying by a constant, referring to a table, and integrating. What\r\ndo we do if we wish to multiply 2 variables together? A neat trick is\r\nto use the formula:\r\n\r\n    _xy_ = ⌠_x dy_ + ⌠_y dx_\r\n           ⌡         ⌡\r\n\r\nTo multiply in this way requires 2 integrators and 1 adder. The\r\nconnections that are made between them are as follows:\r\n\r\n    Shaft _x_           To Integrator 1, Screw\r\n    Shaft _x_           To Integrator 2, Disc\r\n    Shaft _y_           To Integrator 1, Disc\r\n    Shaft _y_           To Integrator 2, Screw\r\n    Integrator 1, Wheel      To Adder 1, Input 1\r\n    Integrator 2, Wheel      To Adder 1, Input 2\r\n    Adder 1, Output          To Shaft expressing _xy_\r\n\r\nA product of 2 variables _under the integral sign_ can be obtained a\r\nlittle more easily, because of the curious powers of the differential\r\nanalyzer. Thus, if it is desired to obtain ∫_xy dt_, we can use the\r\nformula:\r\n\r\n                      ┌          ┐\r\n    ⌠           ⌠     │ ⌠        │\r\n    │_xy dt_ =  │_x d_│ │ _y dt_ │\r\n    ⌡           ⌡     │ ⌡        │\r\n                      └          ┘\r\n\r\nand this operation does not require an adder. The connections are as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    Shaft _t_               To Integrator 1, Disc\r\n    Shaft _y_               To Integrator 1, Screw\r\n    Integrator 1, Wheel          To Integrator 2, Disc\r\n    Shaft _x_               To Integrator 2, Screw\r\n    Integrator 2, Wheel     To Shaft expressing ∫_xy dt_\r\n\r\nIn order to get the quotient of 2 variables, _x_/_y_, we can use some\r\nmore tricks. First, the _reciprocal_ 1/_y_ can be obtained by using the\r\ntwo _simultaneous equations_:\r\n\r\n    ⌠   1                  ⌠     1\r\n    │ ———— _dy_ = log _y_, │ - ———— _d_(log _y_) = _y_\r\n    ⌡  _y_                 ⌡    _y_\r\n\r\nThe connections are as follows:\r\n\r\n    Shaft _y_       To Integrator 1, Disc AND TO Integrator 2, Wheel\r\n    Shaft log _y_   To Integrator 1, Wheel AND TO Integrator 2, Disc\r\n    Shaft 1/_y_     To Integrator 1, Screw, AND NEGATIVELY\r\n                                            TO Integrator 2, Screw\r\n\r\nIn order to get _x_/_y_, we can then multiply _x_ by 1/_y_. We see that\r\nthis setup gives us log _y_ for nothing, that is, without needing more\r\nintegrators or other equipment. Clearly, other tricks like this will\r\ngive sin _x_, cos _x_, _eˣ_, _x²_, and other functions that satisfy\r\nsimple differential equations.\r\n\r\nAn integral of a reciprocal can be obtained even more directly. Suppose\r\nthat\r\n\r\n          ⌠   1\r\n    _y_ = │ ————— _dt_\r\n          ⌡  _x_\r\n\r\n                  1\r\n    Then _Dₜy_ = —————, _D{_y} t_ = _x_,\r\n                 _x_\r\n\r\n              ⌠\r\n    and _t_ = │_x dy_\r\n              ⌡\r\n\r\nThe connections therefore are:\r\n\r\n    Shaft _t_   To Integrator, Wheel\r\n    Shaft _x_   To Integrator, Screw\r\n    Shaft _y_   To Integrator, Disc\r\n\r\nThe light wheel then drives the heavy disc. Clearly only the\r\nangle-indicator device makes this possible at all. Naturally, the\r\ncloser the wheel gets to the center of the disc, that is, _x_\r\napproaching zero, the greater the strain on the mechanism, and the more\r\nlikely the result is to be off. Mathematically, of course, the limit of\r\n1/_x_ as _x_ approaches zero equals infinity, and this gives trouble in\r\nthe machine.\r\n\r\nThere is no standard mathematical method for solving any differential\r\nequation. But the machine provides a standard direct method for\r\nsolving all differential equations with only one independent variable.\r\nFirst: assign a shaft for each _term_ that appears in the equation.\r\nFor example, the highest derivative that appears and the independent\r\nvariable are both assigned shafts. The integral of the highest\r\nderivative is easily obtained, and the integral of that integral, etc.\r\nSecond: connect the shafts so that all the mathematical relations are\r\nexpressed. Both _explicit_ and _implicit_ equations may be expressed.\r\nThird: for any shaft there must be just one _drive_, or source of\r\ntorque. A shaft may, however, drive more than one other shaft. Fourth:\r\nchoose _scale factors_ so that the limits of the machine are not\r\nexceeded yet at the same time are well used. For example, the most\r\nthat an integrator or a function table can move is 1 or 2 feet. Also,\r\nthe number of full turns made by a shaft in representing its variable\r\nshould be large, often between 1000 and 10,000.\r\n\r\nOf course, as with all these large machines, anyone would need some\r\nmonths of actual practice before he could put on a problem and get an\r\nanswer efficiently.\r\n\r\n\r\nAN APPRAISAL OF THE MACHINE\r\n\r\nThe second MIT differential analyzer is probably the best machine\r\never built for solving most differential equations. It regularly has\r\nan accuracy of 1 part in 10,000. This is enough for most engineering\r\nproblems. If greater accuracy is needed, the second differential\r\nanalyzer cannot provide it. Once in a while the machine can reach an\r\naccuracy of 1 part in 50,000; but, to balance this, it is sometimes\r\nless accurate than 1 part in 10,000.\r\n\r\nThe MIT differential analyzer No. 2 can find answers to problems very\r\nquickly. The time for setting up a problem to be run on the machine\r\nranges from 5 to 15 minutes. The time for preparing the tapes that\r\nset up the problem is, of course, longer; but the punch for preparing\r\nthe tape is a separate machine and does not delay the differential\r\nanalyzer. The time for the machine to produce a single solution to a\r\nproblem ranges usually from 3 minutes to a half-hour. It is easy to\r\nput on a problem, run a few solutions, take the problem off, study the\r\nresults, change a few numbers, and then put the problem back on again.\r\nThis virtue is a great help in a search in a new field. While the study\r\nis going on, time is not wasted, for the machine can be busy with a\r\ndifferent problem.\r\n\r\nRunning a problem a second time is a good check on the reliability of\r\nan answer. For, when the problem is run the second time, we can arrange\r\nthat the machine will route the problem to other mechanisms.\r\n\r\nThe machine has a control panel. Here the operator watching the machine\r\ncan tell what units are doing what parts of what problems. If a unit\r\ngives trouble or needs to be inspected, the clerk can throw a “busy”\r\nswitch. Then the machine cannot choose that unit for work to be done.\r\nThe machine contains many protecting signals and alarms. It is idle for\r\nrepairs less than 5 per cent of the time.\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to determine the total cost of the machine, for it was\r\npartially financed by several large gifts. Also, much of the labor\r\nwas done by graduate students in return for the instruction that they\r\ngained. The actual out-of-pocket cost was about $125,000. If the\r\nmachine were to be built by industry, the cost would likely be more\r\nthan 4 times as much. A simple differential analyzer, however, can be\r\ncheap. Small scale differential analyzers have been built for less than\r\n$1000; their accuracy has been about 1 part in 100.\r\n\r\nThere are many things that this machine cannot do; it was not built\r\nto do them. (1) It cannot choose methods of solution. (2) It cannot\r\nperform steps in solving a problem that depend on results as they\r\nare found. (3) It cannot solve differential equations containing two\r\nor more independent variables. Such equations are called _partial\r\ndifferential equations_; they appear in connection with the flow of\r\nheat or air or electricity in 2 or 3 dimensions, and elsewhere. (4)\r\nIt cannot solve problems requiring 6 or more digits of accuracy. (5)\r\nThe machine, while running, can store numbers only for an instant,\r\nsince it operates on the principle of smoothly changing quantities;\r\nhowever, when the machine stops, the number last held by each device is\r\npermanently stored.\r\n\r\nNone of these comments, however, are criticisms of the machine.\r\nInstead they show avenues of development for future machines. As was\r\nsaid before, for solving most differential equations, this machine\r\nhas no equal to date. The range of problems which any differential\r\nanalyzer can do depends mostly on the number of its integrators. The\r\nsecond differential analyzer has 18 and provides for expansion to 30.\r\nThe machine is constructed, also, so that it can be operated in 3\r\nindependent sections, each working to solve a different problem. The\r\ndifferential analyzer can operate unattended. After it has been set up\r\nand the first few results examined, it can be left alone to grind out\r\nlarge blocks of answers.\r\n\r\nAn interesting example of the experimental use of a differential\r\nanalyzer in a commercial business is the following: In Great Britain,\r\nR. E. Beard of the Pearl Assurance Company built a differential\r\nanalyzer with 6 integrators. He applied this machine to compute to 3\r\nfigures certain insurance values known as _continuous annuities_ and\r\n_continuous contingent insurances_. He has described the machine and\r\nthe application he made in a paper published in the _Journal of the\r\nInstitute of Actuaries_, Vol. 71, 1942, pp. 193-227.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 6\r\n\r\nACCURACY TO 23 DIGITS:\r\n\r\nHARVARD’S IBM AUTOMATIC\r\n\r\nSEQUENCE-CONTROLLED CALCULATOR\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the first giant brains to be finished was the machine in the\r\nComputation Laboratory at Harvard University called the _IBM Automatic\r\nSequence-Controlled Calculator_. This great mechanical brain started\r\nwork in April 1944 and has been running 24 hours a day almost all the\r\ntime ever since. It has produced quantities of information for the\r\nUnited States Navy. Although many problems that have been placed on it\r\nhave been classified by the Navy as confidential, the machine itself\r\nis fully public. The way it was working on Sept. 1, 1945, has been\r\nthoroughly described in a 540-page book published in 1946, Volume I of\r\nthe Annals of the Harvard Computation Laboratory, entitled _Manual of\r\nOperation of the Automatic Sequence-Controlled Calculator_. Since then\r\nthe machine has been improved in many ways.\r\n\r\nThis machine does thousands of calculating steps, one after another,\r\naccording to a scheme fixed ahead of time. This property is what gives\r\nthe machine its name: _automatic_, since the individual operations are\r\nautomatic, once the punched tape fixing the chain of operations has\r\nbeen put on the machine, and _sequence-controlled_, since control over\r\nthe sequence of its operations has been built into the machine.\r\n\r\n\r\nORIGIN AND DEVELOPMENT\r\n\r\nMore than a hundred years ago, an English mathematician and actuary,\r\nCharles Babbage (1792-1871), designed a machine—or _engine_ as\r\nhe called it—that would carry out the sequences of mathematical\r\noperations. In the 1830’s he received a government grant to build\r\nan _analytical engine_ whereby long chains of calculations could be\r\nperformed. But he was unsuccessful, because the refined physical\r\ndevices necessary for quantities of digital calculation were not\r\nyet developed. Only in the 1930’s did these physical devices become\r\nsufficiently versatile and reliable for a calculator of hundreds of\r\nthousands of parts to be successful.\r\n\r\nThe Automatic Sequence-Controlled Calculator at Harvard was largely the\r\nconcept of Professor Howard H. Aiken of Harvard. It was built through\r\na partnership of efforts, ideas, and engineering between him and the\r\nInternational Business Machines Corporation, in the years 1937 to\r\n1944. The calculator was a gift from IBM to Harvard University. Some\r\nvery useful additional control units, named the _Subsidiary Sequence\r\nMechanism_, were built at the Harvard Computation Laboratory in 1947\r\nand joined to the machine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1. Scheme of Harvard IBM Automatic\r\nSequence-Controlled Calculator.]\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL ORGANIZATION\r\n\r\nThe machine (see Fig. 1) is about 50 feet long, 8 feet high, and about\r\n2 feet wide. It consists of 22 panels; 17 of them are set in a straight\r\nline, and the last 5 are at the rear of the machine. In the scheme of\r\nthe machine shown in Fig. 1, the details you would see in a photograph\r\nhave been left out. Instead you see the sections of the machine that\r\nare important because of what they do: _input_, _memory_, _control_,\r\nand _output_. Why do we not see a section labeled “computer”? Because\r\nin this mechanical brain the computing part of the machine is closely\r\njoined to the memory: every storage register can add and subtract. We\r\nshall soon discuss these sections of the machine more fully.\r\n\r\n\r\nPHYSICAL DEVICES\r\n\r\nNow in order for any brain to work, _physical devices_ must be used.\r\nFor example, in the human body, a nerve is the physical device that\r\ncarries information from one part of the body to another. In the\r\nHarvard machine, an insulated _wire_ is the physical device that\r\ncarries information from one part of the machine to another. One side\r\nof every panel in the Harvard machine is heavily laden with a great\r\nnetwork of wires. Between the panels, you can see in many places cables\r\nas thick as your arm and containing hundreds of wires. More than 500\r\nmiles of wire are used.\r\n\r\nThe physical devices in the Harvard machine are numerous, as we would\r\nexpect. It is perhaps not surprising that this machine has more than\r\n760,000 parts. But, curiously enough, there are only 7 main kinds of\r\nphysical devices in the major part of the machine. They are: wire,\r\n_two-position switches_, _two-position relays_ (see Chapter 2),\r\n_ten-position switches_, _ten-position relays_, _buttons_, and _cam\r\ncontacts_ (see below). These are the devices that handle information\r\nin the form of electrical impulses. They can be combined by electrical\r\ncircuits in a great variety of ways. There are, of course, other kinds\r\nof physical devices that are important, but they are not numerous,\r\nand they have rather simple duties. Looking at the machine, you can\r\nsee three examples easily. Physical devices of the first kind convert\r\npunched holes into electrical impulses: 2 _card feeds_, 4 _tape feeds_.\r\nThose of the second kind convert electrical impulses into punched\r\nholes: 1 _card punch_, 1 _tape punch_. Those of the third kind convert\r\nelectrical impulses into printed characters: 2 _electric typewriters_.\r\nWe can think of a fourth kind of physical device that would be a help,\r\nbut, at present writing, it does not yet exist: a device that converts\r\nprinted characters into electrical impulses.\r\n\r\nThe Harvard machine, of course, is complicated. But it is complicated\r\nbecause of the variety of ways in which relatively simple devices have\r\nbeen connected together to make a machine that thinks.\r\n\r\n\r\nSwitches\r\n\r\nA _two-position switch_ (see Fig. 2) turned by hand connects a wire to\r\neither one of 2 others. These 2 positions may stand for “yes” and “no,”\r\n0 and 1, etc. There are many two-position switches in the machine. A\r\n_ten-position switch_ or _dial switch_ (see Fig. 3) turned by hand\r\nconnects the wire running into the center of the switch with a wire at\r\nany one of ten positions 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 around the edge.\r\nThere are over 1400 dial switches in the machine. How does turning the\r\npointer on the top of the dial make connection between the center wire\r\nand the edge wire? Under the face of the dial is the part that works, a\r\nshort rod of metal fastened to the pointer (shown with dashes in Fig.\r\n3). When the pointer turns, this rod also turns, making the desired\r\nconnection.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2. Two-position switch.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3. Dial switch.]\r\n\r\n\r\nRelays\r\n\r\n_Two-position relays_—more often called just _relays_ (see Chapter\r\n2)—do the automatic routing of the electrical impulses that cause\r\ncomputing to take place. Each relay may take 2 positions, open or\r\nclosed, and these positions may stand for 0 and 1. There are more than\r\n3000 relays in the Harvard machine.\r\n\r\nA magnet pulling one way and a spring pulling the other way are\r\nsufficient in an ordinary relay to give 2 positions, “on” and “off,”\r\n“yes” and “no,” 0 and 1. But how do we make a relay that can hold any\r\none of 10 positions? Figure 4 shows one scheme for a _ten-position\r\nrelay_. The _arm_ can take any one of 10 positions, connecting the\r\ncontact _Common_ to any one of the contacts O, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,\r\nand 9 so that current can flow. The _gear_ turns all the time. When\r\nan impulse comes in on the _Pickup_ line, the _clutch_ connects the\r\narm to the gear. When an impulse comes in on the _Drop-out_ line, the\r\nclutch disconnects the arm from the gear. For example, suppose that the\r\nten-position relay is stopped at contact 2, as shown. Suppose that we\r\nnow pick up the relay, hold it just long enough to turn 3 steps, and\r\nthen drop it out. The relay will now rest at contact 5.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4. Scheme of a ten-position relay, or counter\r\nposition.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5. Scheme of a counter wheel.]\r\n\r\nIn the Harvard machine, the ten-position relays, much like the scheme\r\nshown, do the same work as _counter wheels_ (Fig. 5) in an ordinary\r\ndesk calculating machine, and so they are often spoken of as _counter\r\npositions_ in the Harvard machine. They are very useful in the machine\r\nnot only because they express the 10 decimal digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4,\r\n5, 6, 7, 8, 9 but also because adding and subtracting numbers is\r\naccomplished by turning them through the proper number of steps. In\r\nfact, an additional impulse is provided when the counter position turns\r\nfrom 9 to 0, for purposes of carry. A group of 24 counter positions\r\nmakes up each _storage counter_—or _storage register_—in the machine.\r\nThere are 2200 of these counter positions. Each is connected to a\r\ncontinuously running gear on a small shaft (Fig. 6). All these shafts\r\nare connected by other gears and shafts to a main drive shaft, and they\r\nare driven by a 5-horsepower motor at the back of the machine. When\r\na counter position is supposed to step, a clutch connects the drive\r\nto the running gear, and the counter position steps. When the counter\r\nposition is supposed to stay unchanged, the clutch is disconnected\r\nand the driving gear runs free. In fact, when you first approach the\r\nHarvard machine, about the first thing you are aware of is the running\r\nof these gears and the intermittent whirring and clicking of the\r\ncounter positions as they step. The machine gives a fine impression of\r\nbeing busy!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6. Scheme of counter 16.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTiming Contacts\r\n\r\nA _button_ (see Fig. 7) is a device for closing an electric circuit\r\nwhen and only when you push it. A simple example is the button for\r\nringing a bell: you push the button, a circuit is closed, and something\r\nhappens. When you let go, the circuit is opened. The Harvard machine\r\nhas a button for starting, a button for stopping, and many others.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7. Button.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8. Cam, with 5 lobes and contact.]\r\n\r\nA _cam contact_ (see Fig. 8) is an automatic device for closing an\r\nelectric circuit for just a short interval of time. When the lobes\r\non the cam strike the contact, it closes and current flows. When the\r\nlobes have gone by, the spring pushes open the contact, and no current\r\nflows. Just as a two-position relay is the automatic equivalent of\r\na two-position switch, and a ten-position relay is the automatic\r\nequivalent of a ten-position switch, so a cam contact is the automatic\r\nequivalent of a button.\r\n\r\nAll the cams in the machine have 20 pockets where small round metal\r\nlobes may or may not be inserted. Each cam makes a full turn once in\r\n³/₁₀ of a second and is in time with all the others. Thus we can time\r\nall the electrical circuits in the machine in units of ³/₂₀₀ of a\r\nsecond.\r\n\r\n\r\nNUMBERS\r\n\r\nNumbers in the machine regularly consist of 23 decimal digits. The 24th\r\nnumerical position at the left in any register contains only 0 for a\r\npositive number and only 9 for a negative number. _Nines complements_\r\n(see Supplement 2) are used for negative numbers. For example,-00284 is\r\nrepresented as 999715, supposing that we had 5-digit numbers instead\r\nof 23-digit numbers. The sum of two nines complements is automatically\r\ncorrected so that it is still a correct nines complement. The device\r\nthat accomplishes this is called _end-around-carry_ (see Supplement 2).\r\nThe decimal point is fixed for each problem; in other words, in any\r\nproblem, the decimal point is consistently kept in one place, usually\r\nbetween the 15th and 16th decimal columns from the right.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW INFORMATION GOES INTO THE MACHINE\r\n\r\nNumerical information may go into the machine in any one of 3 ways: (1)\r\nby regular IBM punch cards, using standard IBM card feeds (panel 16);\r\n(2) by hand-set dial switches (panels 1, 2); and (3) by long loops of\r\npunched tape placed on the value tape feeds (panels 12 to 14). Three\r\nsets of 24 columns each punched on a regular IBM punch card can be\r\nused to send 3 numbers and their signs into the machine in one machine\r\ncycle. This is the fastest way for giving numbers to the machine, but\r\nthe most limited; for the cards must be referred to in order and can\r\nbe referred to automatically only once. Also, there is the risk that\r\nthey may be out of order. A card may be passed through the machine\r\nwithout reading; this saves some sorting in preparing cards for the\r\nmachine. Machines for preparing the cards are regular IBM key punches,\r\nand machines for sorting them after preparation are regular IBM card\r\nsorters.\r\n\r\nIn panels 1 and 2 there are 60 registers by which unchanging numbers\r\nlike 1, or 3.14159265···, or 7.65 may be put into the machine. These\r\nare called the _constant registers_. Each constant register consists of\r\n24 dial switches and contains 23 digits and a sign, 0 if positive and\r\n9 if negative. Whenever the mathematician says a certain constant is\r\nneeded for a problem, the operator of the machine walks over to these\r\npanels, and, while the machine is turned off, sets the dial switches\r\nfor the number, one by one, by hand. If we need 40 constants of 10\r\ndigits each for a problem, then the operator sets 400 dial switches by\r\nhand and makes certain that the remaining 14 switches in each of the 40\r\nconstant registers used are either at 0 or 9, depending on the sign of\r\nthe number. Only then can he return to start the machine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9. Value tape code.]\r\n\r\nThe third means by which numerical information can be put into the\r\nmachine is the _value tape feeds_, in panels 12, 13, and 14. Here the\r\nmachine can consult tables of numbers. The numbers are punched on paper\r\ntape 24 holes wide, made of punch-card stock. Tapes for the value tape\r\nfeeds may be prepared by hand or by the machine itself using punch\r\ncards or machine calculation. The tapes use equally spaced _arguments_\r\n(see Supplement 2). The tape punch changes the decimal digits in its\r\nkeyboard into the following punching code (see Fig. 9):\r\n\r\n    0  0000      5  1100\r\n    1  1000      6  1010\r\n    2  0100      7  1001\r\n    3  0010      8  0110\r\n    4  0001      9  0101\r\n\r\nHere the 1 denotes a punched hole and 0 no punched hole, and the 4\r\ncolumns from left to right of the code correspond to 4 rows of the\r\npaper tape from bottom to top. To make sure the value tape is correct,\r\nthe machine itself can read the value tape and check it mathematically\r\nor compare it with punch-card values.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW INFORMATION COMES OUT OF THE MACHINE\r\n\r\nInformation comes out of the machine in any one of three ways: (1) by\r\npunching on IBM cards with a regular IBM card punch that is built into\r\nthe machine (panel 17), (2) by typing on paper sheets with electric\r\ntypewriters (panels 16 and 17), and (3) by punching paper tape 24 holes\r\nwide of the same kind as is fed into the machine.\r\n\r\nUsually, one of the electric typewriters is used to print a result for\r\na visual check and to print it before the machine makes a specified\r\ncheck of the value. Then, about 10 seconds later, after the result has\r\nbeen checked as specified in the machine, the checked result is printed\r\nby the second typewriter. In the second typewriter, a special one-use\r\ncarbon ribbon of paper is used to produce copy for publication by a\r\nphotographic process.\r\n\r\nThe card punch writes a number more rapidly than an electric\r\ntypewriter. This extra speed is sometimes very useful. However, the\r\npunch’s chief purpose is to record intermediate results on punch cards.\r\nThen, if there is a machine failure, and if the problem has been well\r\norganized, the problem may be run over from these intermediate results,\r\ninstead of requiring a return to the original starting information.\r\nThe tape punch used for preparing tape by hand can also be operated by\r\ncable from the machine.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW INFORMATION IS HANDLED IN THE MACHINE\r\n\r\nThe machine is a mechanical brain. So, between taking in information\r\nand putting out information, the machine does some “thinking.” It\r\ndoes this thinking according to instructions. The instructions go\r\ninto the machine as: (1) the setting of switches, or (2) the pressing\r\nof buttons, or (3) the wiring of plugboards, or (4) feeding in tape\r\npunched with holes. The instructions are remembered in the machine in\r\nthese 4 ways, and we can call these sets of devices the control of the\r\nmachine.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate: One of the buttons pressed for every problem is the\r\nStart Key: when you press it, the machine starts to work on the\r\nproblem. One of the switches with which you give instructions is\r\na switch that turns electric typewriter 1 on or off. One of the\r\nplugboards contains some hubs by which you can tell the machine how\r\nmany figures to choose in the quotient when dividing, for clearly you\r\ndo not need a quotient of 23 figures every time the machine divides.\r\nYou can have 5 choices in any one problem; you can specify them by\r\nplugging, and you can call for any one of 5 choices of quotient size\r\nfrom time to time during the problem. In many cases, when we wish\r\nthe machine to do the same thing for all of a single problem and do\r\nit whenever the occasion arises, we can put the instruction into the\r\nwiring of a plugboard. We use plugboard wiring, for example, in fixing\r\nthe decimal point in multiplication, so that the product will read out\r\nproperly, and in guiding the operation of the typewriters, so that\r\nprinting will take place in the columns where we want it.\r\n\r\n\r\nSequence of Steps\r\n\r\nThe most important part of the control of the machine is the\r\n_sequence-tape feed_ and its _sequence-control tape_. These tell the\r\nmachine a great part of what operations are to be performed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10. Sequence-control tape code.]\r\n\r\nAt the end of the room where the machine is, there is the special tape\r\npunch mentioned above. It holds a big spool of card stock that is thin,\r\nflexible, smooth, and tough. With one keyboard we may prepare value\r\ntape. With another keyboard we prepare the sequence-control tape.\r\nThe tape (see Fig. 10) contains places for 24 round punched holes in\r\neach row. Some and only some of these holes are punched. Each row of\r\npunched holes is equivalent to an instruction to the machine and is\r\ncalled a _line of coding_ or _coding line_. In general, the instruction\r\nhas the form:\r\n\r\n    Take a number out of Register _A_; put the number\r\n      into Register _B_; and perform operation _C_.\r\n\r\nThe first group of 8 holes at the left is called the _A field_ or the\r\n_out-field_. Here we tell the machine where a number is to be taken\r\nfrom. The middle group of 8 holes is called the _B field_ or the\r\n_in-field_. Here we tell the machine where a number is to be put. The\r\nlast group of 8 holes is called the _C field_ or the _miscellaneous\r\nfield_. Here we tell the machine part or all of the operation that is\r\nto be performed.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate (see Fig. 10), we have holes 3, 2, 1 punched in the _A_\r\nfield, holes 3, 2 punched in the _B_ field, and hole 7 punched in the\r\n_C_ field. Now 321 is the _code_—or machine language, or machine call\r\nnumber—for storage counter 7; 32 is the code for storage counter 6;\r\nand 7 in the _C_ field is the code (in this case, and generally) for\r\n“Add, and read the next line of coding.” So, if we punch out this line\r\nof coding and put the tape on the machine, we tell the machine to read\r\nthe number in counter 7, add it into counter 6, and proceed to the next\r\nline of coding and read that.\r\n\r\nThe holes in each group of 8 holes from left to right are numbered: 8,\r\n7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. The code 631, for example, means that holes 6, 3,\r\n1 are punched and that no holes are punched at 8, 7, 5, 4, 2. Since it\r\nis more natural, the code is read from left to right, or 631, instead\r\nof from right to left in the sequence 136.\r\n\r\nThe devices in the machine have _in-codes_, used in the in-field, and\r\n_out-codes_, used in the out-field. For each of the 72 regular storage\r\ncounters, the in-code and the out-code are the same. The first 8\r\nstorage counters have the codes 1, 2, 21, 3, 31, 32, 321, 4, 41; the\r\nlast 2 storage counters, the 71st and the 72nd, have the codes 7321, 74.\r\n\r\nThe constant registers—often called _constant switches_, or just\r\n_switches_—naturally have only out-codes, since numbers can be entered\r\ninto the constant registers only by setting dial switches by hand.\r\nThe first 8 constant registers have the out-codes 741, 742, 7421, 743,\r\n7431, 7432, 74321, 75, and the 59th and 60th constant registers have\r\nthe out-codes 821, 83.\r\n\r\n\r\nTransferring, Adding, and Clearing\r\n\r\nEach storage counter has the property that any number transferred into\r\nit is added into it. For example, the instruction\r\n\r\n    Take the number in switch 741; transfer it into storage register 321\r\n\r\nis coded:\r\n\r\n    741, 321, 7\r\n\r\nThe 7 in the third column is an instruction to the sequence-tape feed\r\nto turn up to the next coding line and read it. If any number is\r\nalready stored in register 321, the content of 741 will be added to it,\r\nand the total will then be stored in 321.\r\n\r\nResetting or clearing a regular storage register is accomplished by a\r\ncoding that is a departure from the usual scheme of “out” and “in.” The\r\ninstruction\r\n\r\n    Clear register 321; read the next coding line\r\n\r\nis coded:\r\n\r\n    321, 321, 7\r\n\r\nSimilarly, you can clear any other regular storage register if you\r\nrepeat its code in the out-and in-fields. However, a few of the storage\r\nregisters in the machine have special reset codes, and these may occur\r\nin any of the three fields _A_, _B_, _C_.\r\n\r\nAs the result of a recent modification of the machine, you can easily\r\ndouble the number in any storage register. For example, the instruction\r\n\r\n    Double the number in register 321; read the next coding line\r\n\r\nis coded:\r\n\r\n    321, 321, 743\r\n\r\n\r\nSubtracting\r\n\r\nIf the number in switch 741 is to be subtracted from the number in\r\nstorage counter 321, the instruction is changed into:\r\n\r\n    Take the negative of the number in switch 741; transfer\r\n      it into storage register 321; read the next line of coding\r\n\r\nThe coding line becomes:\r\n\r\n    741, 321, 732\r\n\r\nBy putting 32 in the _C_ field, we cause the number in switch 741 to be\r\nsubtracted from whatever number is in register 321.\r\n\r\nWe have 2 more choices in adding and subtracting. The value of the\r\nnumber without regard to sign—in other words, its _absolute value_ (see\r\nSupplement 2)—may be added or subtracted. The instruction\r\n\r\n    Add the absolute value of\r\n\r\nis expressed by a _C_ field code 2, and the instruction\r\n\r\n    Add the negative of the absolute value of\r\n\r\nis expressed by a _C_ field code 1.\r\n\r\n\r\nMultiplying\r\n\r\nWhen we wish to multiply one number by another and get a product, we\r\nhave 3 numbers. We tell the machine about each of these numbers on\r\na separate line of coding. Multiplication is signaled by sending a\r\nnumber into the _multiplicand counter_. The multiplicand counter has an\r\nin-code 761. If the multiplicand is in 321, the instruction is:\r\n\r\n    Take the number in 321; enter it as multiplicand; read the\r\n    next coding line\r\n\r\nThe coding is:\r\n\r\n    321, 761, 7\r\n\r\nOn the third following coding line, the multiplier is sent into\r\nthe _multiplier counter_. If the multiplier is in switch 741, the\r\ninstruction is:\r\n\r\nTake the number in 741; enter it as multiplier; read the next coding\r\nline\r\n\r\nThe coding is:\r\n\r\n    741, ——, 7\r\n\r\nWe do not punch anything in the middle field: the machine is “educated”\r\nand “knows” that it has started a multiplication and needs a\r\nmultiplier, and it expects this multiplier in the third coding line. To\r\nhave no code for the multiplier counter is, of course, a departure from\r\nthe general rule, but it saves some punching and permits the use of\r\nthis space for certain other codes, thus saving some operating time.\r\n\r\nWe need not confuse the 761 in-code for the multiplicand counter with\r\nthe 761 out-code, which happens to be the out-code of the 25th constant\r\nregister, because neither can occur in the other’s field. We may, of\r\ncourse, use other registers besides 321 and 741 for supplying the\r\nmultiplicand and multiplier.\r\n\r\nTo get the product and put it into any storage counter _D_, we use two\r\nlines of coding one right after the other:\r\n\r\n     ——    ——   6421\r\n    8761   _D_   ——\r\n\r\nThe _product counter_ has the out-code 8761. When the product is\r\ndesired, it is called for, transferred into counter _D_, and the\r\nmultiplication unit is automatically cleared. It takes time, however,\r\nfor the machine to perform a multiplication. That is the reason for\r\nthe preceding coding line and the 6421 in the _C_ field. While the\r\nmultiplication is going on, we can instruct the machine to do other\r\nthings that we want done. We can insert or _interpose_ coding lines in\r\nbetween the multiplier line and the product line. For example, if we\r\nhave a multiplier of 10 digits, we can insert 8 coding lines and maybe\r\nmore. The 6421 code essentially tells the machine to finish both the\r\nmultiplication and the interposed instructions, and, as soon as the\r\nlater one of these two tasks is finished, to transfer out the product\r\nto counter _D_.\r\n\r\nUp to the middle of 1946, the wiring of the machine was a little\r\ndifferent and less convenient. When the product was obtained by the\r\nmultiplication unit, it had to be accepted and transferred at once into\r\none of the 72 storage registers.\r\n\r\n\r\nDividing\r\n\r\nDivision is called for by first sending the divisor into the _divisor\r\ncounter_, and this has a code 76 in the _B_ field. If the divisor is in\r\ncounter 321, the instruction may be:\r\n\r\n    Take the number in 321; enter it as divisor; read the next\r\n      coding line\r\n\r\nThe coding will then be:\r\n\r\n    321, 76, 7\r\n\r\nThree coding lines later, the dividend is called for, and the coding,\r\nif the dividend is in switch 7431, is:\r\n\r\n    7431, ——, 7\r\n\r\nWe can send the quotient, when ready, into any desired counter _Q_ by\r\nthe following two lines of coding:\r\n\r\n    ——    ——   642\r\n    876   _Q_   ——\r\n\r\nIn the same way as with multiplication, we can insert a number of\r\ncoding lines in between the dividend line and the first quotient line.\r\n\r\nBoth multiplication and division are carried out in the same unit of\r\nthe machine, the _multiply-divide unit_. The machine first constructs\r\na table of the multiples of the multiplicand or divisor: 1 times, 2\r\ntimes, 3 times, ···, 9 times. In multiplication this table is then used\r\nby selecting multiples according to the digits of the multiplier one\r\nafter another. In division the table is used by comparing multiples of\r\nthe divisor against the dividend and successive remainders, finding\r\nwhich will go and which will not. Since the numbers in the machine are\r\nnormally of 15 to 23 digits, any particular multiple will be used,\r\non the average, several times, and so this process is relatively\r\nefficient. Actually the multiplicand and the divisor go into the same\r\ncounter. Division, however, has the code 76 and multiplication the code\r\n761, and so the difference is essentially an operation code not in the\r\nthird or _C_ field.\r\n\r\n\r\nConsulting a Table\r\n\r\nWhen we desire the machine to consult a table of values (i.e., a\r\n_function_—see Supplement 2), we punch the table with its arguments and\r\nfunction values on a tape, and we put the tape on a value tape feed\r\nmechanism. The instruction to the machine may be:\r\n\r\n    Take the number in register _A_; find the value of the\r\n      function for this number, and enter it in register _B_.\r\n\r\nThe coding is:\r\n\r\n    ——       ——       73\r\n    _A_     7654      61\r\n    ——       ——      762\r\n    ——       ——      543\r\n    ——       ——    75431\r\n    841     7654     ——\r\n    _A_      763    6421\r\n    8762      _B_     73\r\n    ——      8763       7\r\n\r\nWithout explaining this coding line by line, we can say that this is\r\nwhat happens:\r\n\r\n    The machine reads the argument in register _A_.\r\n      The machine reads the argument in the table at which\r\n      the value tape feed is resting.\r\n\r\n    It subtracts them, and thereby determines how far away\r\n      the desired argument is.\r\n\r\n    The machine then turns the tape that required distance.\r\n\r\n    It checks that the new argument is the wanted argument.\r\n\r\n    It reads the value of the function entered at that\r\n      point on the function tape.\r\n\r\n\r\nSelecting\r\n\r\nThere is a storage counter in the machine that is called the _selection\r\ncounter_. The selection counter is counter 70 and has the code 732. It\r\nhas all the properties of an ordinary storage counter and, in addition,\r\none extra property: depending on the sign of the number stored in the\r\nselection counter, it is possible to select whether some other number\r\nshall be treated positively or negatively. In other words, addition of\r\na number anywhere in the machine may take place either positively or\r\nnegatively, if the number stored in the selection counter is positive\r\nor negative, respectively.\r\n\r\nFor example, suppose that _x_ is the number in the selection counter.\r\nSuppose that _y_ is the number in some other counter _A_. Suppose that\r\n_z_ is the number in counter _B_. Suppose that we use the coding:\r\n\r\n    _A_, _B_, 7432\r\n\r\nWhat we get in _B_, because of the 7432 in the third or _C_ field, is\r\n_z_ plus _y_ if _x_ is positive or zero, and _z_ minus _y_ if _x_ is\r\nnegative. In the language of the algebra of logic (see Chapter 9 and\r\nSupplement 2), where _T_( ...) is “the truth value of ...,” the number\r\nin _b_ equals:\r\n\r\n    _z_ + _y_·_T_(_x_ ≥ 0) - _y_·_T_(_x_ < 0)\r\n\r\n(The nines complement of 0, namely 999···9 to 24 digits, is treated by\r\nthe machine as negative.)\r\n\r\nWhy do we need an operation like this in a mechanical brain? Among\r\nother reasons, what we want to do with a number, in mathematics, often\r\ndepends on its sign. It may happen that a table is, for negative\r\narguments, the negative of what it is for positive arguments; in\r\nother words, _F_(-_x_) =-_F_(_x_). This is true, for instance, for a\r\ntable of _cubes_ {_F_(_x_) = _x_³} or for a table of _trigonometric\r\ntangents_ (see Supplement 2). If so, we certainly do not want to take\r\nthe time and trouble to list the whole table. We put down only half\r\nthe table and then, if _x_ is negative, use the negative of the value\r\nin the table. In order to apply such a time-saving rule when using the\r\nmachine, we need the selection counter or its equivalent.\r\n\r\n\r\nChecking\r\n\r\nThere is another special counter in the machine that is called the\r\n_check counter_. It also has all the properties of an ordinary storage\r\ncounter and, in addition, one extra property: If the sign of the number\r\nstored in the check counter on a certain coding line is negative, then\r\non the next coding line the machine may be stopped. In other words,\r\nsuppose that the check counter stores a certain tolerance _t_. Suppose,\r\nunder the instructions we give the machine, that it calculates a\r\npositive number _x_ that ought to be less than this tolerance. Suppose\r\nthat something may go wrong and that _x_ actually may be greater than\r\n_t_. Then we put a check into our instructions. We tell the machine:\r\n\r\n    When you have found _x_, subtract it from _t_.\r\n\r\n    If the result is positive, go ahead.\r\n\r\n    If the result is negative or zero, _stop_!\r\n\r\nHere is the coding. Suppose that the tolerance _t_ is in switch 751.\r\nSuppose that the number _x_ to be checked is in counter 4321. Then the\r\ninstructions and coding are:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Clear the check counter                                   —    —    7\r\n    Put in the tolerance, from switch 751                     751  74   7\r\n    Subtract the absolute value of the number to be checked  4321  74  71\r\n    Stop, O Mechanical Brain, if your result be negative!      —    —  64\r\n\r\nAn operation like this is very useful in a mechanical brain. It\r\nenables the calculation to be interrupted if something has gone\r\nwrong. Of course, other operations of checking besides this one are\r\nused—for example, inspecting for reasonableness the results printed on\r\ntypewriter 1.\r\n\r\n\r\nOther Operations\r\n\r\nThere are other operations in the machine. There are two pairs of\r\nstorage registers that can be _coupled_ together so that we can handle\r\nproblems requiring numbers of 46 digits instead of 23. Registers 64\r\nand 65 can be coupled, and registers 68 and 69 can be coupled. There\r\nis another storage counter, No. 71, that has an extra property. We can\r\nread out the number it holds times 1, or times 10¹², or times 10⁻¹²,\r\nas may be called for. As a result of this counter, we can do problems\r\nrequiring 144 registers storing numbers of 11 digits each, instead of\r\n72 registers storing 23 digits each. Bigger statistical problems can be\r\nhandled, for example.\r\n\r\nThere are some minor sequences of operations, or _subroutines_, that\r\ncan be called for by a single code. The subroutine may be a whole set\r\nof additions, subtractions, multiplications, divisions, and choices,\r\nhaving a single purpose: to compute some number by a _process of rapid\r\napproximation_ (see Supplement 2). There are built-in subroutines for\r\nsome special mathematical functions: the _logarithm_ of a number to the\r\nbase 10, the _exponential_ of a number to the base 10, and the _sine_\r\nof a number. (See Supplement 2.)\r\n\r\nThere are also 10 changeable subroutines, each of 22 coding lines,\r\nwhich can be called in, when wanted, by the main sequence-control tape\r\nor by each other. These subroutines constitute the Subsidiary Sequence\r\nMechanism, and are extremely useful. They have _A_, _B_, and _C_ fields\r\njust like the main sequence-control, but they are given information by\r\nplugging with short lengths of wire instead of by feeding punched paper\r\ntape.\r\n\r\n\r\nRAPID APPROXIMATION FOR A LOGARITHM\r\n\r\nUp to this point in this chapter the author has tried to tell the facts\r\nabout the Harvard machine in plain words. But for reading this section,\r\na little knowledge of calculus is necessary. (See also Supplement 2.)\r\nIf you wish, skip this section and go on to the next one.\r\n\r\nWhat is the process that the machine uses to compute any desired\r\nlogarithm to 23 digits? Suppose that we take for an example the process\r\nby which the machine computes log_{10} 49.3724. We choose a 6-digit\r\nnumber for simplicity; the machine would handle a 23-digit number in\r\nthe same way. The process uses 2 fundamental equations involving the\r\nlogarithm: the sum relation\r\n\r\n    log (_a_·_b_·_c_···) = log _a_ + log _b_ + log _c_···\r\n\r\nand the series relation\r\n\r\n                          _h_²   _h_³   _h_⁴\r\n    logₑ(1 + _h_) = _h_ - ———— + ———— - ———— + ···, │_h_│ < 1\r\n                           2      3      4\r\n\r\nThe error in this series is less than the first neglected term. Now,\r\nthe machine stores the base 10 logarithms (to 23 decimal places) of the\r\nfollowing 36 numbers:\r\n\r\n     1   1.1  1.01  1.001\r\n     2   1.2  1.02  1.002\r\n    ...  ...   ...   ...\r\n     9   1.9  1.09  1.009\r\n\r\nFirst, the number 49.3724 is examined in a counter called the\r\n_Logarithm-In-Out counter_, and the position of the decimal point is\r\ndetermined, giving the _characteristic_ of the logarithm. The number\r\n49.3724 has the characteristic 1. Next, 4 successive divisions are\r\nperformed, in which the 4 divisors are (1) the first digit of the\r\nnumber, (2) the first 2 digits of the quotient, (3) the first 3 digits\r\nof the next quotient, and (4) the first 4 digits of the subsequent\r\nquotient; thus,\r\n\r\n    4.93724/4 = 1.23431\r\n\r\n    1.23431/1.2 = 1.02860\r\n\r\n    1.02860/1.02 = 1.00843\r\n\r\n    1.00843/1.008 = 1.00043\r\n\r\nFor simplicity we have kept only 6 digits, although the machine, of\r\ncourse, would keep 23. It is interesting to note that the machine is\r\nable to sense digits and thus determine the 4 divisors; this is an\r\narithmetical and numerical process and one that cannot be done in\r\nordinary algebra. We now have:\r\n\r\n    log₁₀ 49.3724 = 1 + log₁₀ 4 + log₁₀ 1.2 + log₁₀ 1.02\r\n                      + log₁₀ 1.008 + log₁₀ 1.00043\r\n\r\nTo compute log₁₀ 1.00043 to 21 decimals we use\r\n\r\n               (      _h_²    _h_³     _h_⁴    _h_⁵   _h_⁶ )\r\n    log₁₀_e_ · (_h_ - ————— + —————  - ———— + ————— - —————)\r\n               (       2       3         4      5      6   )\r\n\r\nwith _h_ = 0.00043. Only 6 terms of the series relation are needed.\r\nFor, the error is less than _h_⁷/7, which is less than 10⁻²¹/7, since\r\n_h_ < ¹/₁₀₀₀. The machine uses the series relation in the form\r\n\r\n    log₁₀ (1 + _h_) = {([{(_c_₆_h_ + _c_₅)_h_ + _c_₄}_h_\r\n\r\n                        + _c_₃]_h_ + _c_₂)_h_ + _c_₁}_h_\r\n    where\r\n\r\n    _c_₁ = _M_, _c_₂ = -_M_/2, _c_₃ = _M_/3, ···,\r\n\r\n    and _M_ = log₁₀__e_= 0.434294···.\r\n\r\nThe 6 values of the _c_’s are also stored in the machine. When any\r\nlogarithm is to be computed, the sum of the characteristic, of the 4\r\nlogarithms of the successive divisors, and of the first 6 terms of the\r\nseries relation gives the logarithm. The maximum time required is 90\r\nseconds.\r\n\r\n\r\nAN APPRAISAL OF THE CALCULATOR\r\n\r\nThe IBM Automatic Sequence-Controlled Calculator at Harvard is a\r\nlandmark in the development of machines that think. Its capacity for\r\nmany problems for which it is suited is far beyond the capacity of a\r\nhundred human computers.\r\n\r\n\r\nSpeed\r\n\r\nThe time required in the machine for adding, subtracting, transferring,\r\nor clearing numbers is ³/₁₀ of a second. This is the time of one\r\nmachine cycle or of reading one coding line. Multiplication takes at\r\nthe most 6 seconds, and an average of 4 seconds. Division takes at the\r\nmost 16 seconds, and an average of 11 seconds. Each, however, requires\r\nonly 3 lines of coding, or ⁹/₁₀ of a second’s attention from the\r\nsequence mechanism; interposed operations fill the rest of the time.\r\nTo calculate a logarithm, an exponential, or a sine to the full number\r\nof digits obtainable by means of the automatic subroutine takes at\r\nthe most 90, 66, and 60 seconds, respectively. To get three 24-digit\r\nnumbers from feeding a punch card takes ⅓ second. To punch a number\r\ntakes from ½ second up to 3 seconds. To print a number takes from 1½\r\nseconds up to 7 seconds.\r\n\r\n\r\nCost and Value\r\n\r\nThe cost of the machine was somewhere near 3 or 4 hundred thousand\r\ndollars, if we leave out some of the cost of research and development,\r\nwhich would have been done whether or not this particular machine had\r\never been built. A staff of 10 men, consisting of 4 mathematicians,\r\n4 operators, and 2 maintenance men, are needed to keep the machine\r\nrunning 24 hours a day. This might represent, if capitalized, another\r\n1 or 2 hundred thousand dollars. If a capital value of $500,000 is\r\ntaken as equivalent to $50,000 a year, then the cost of the machine in\r\noperation 24 hours a day is in the neighborhood of $150 a day or $6 an\r\nhour.\r\n\r\nThe value of the machine, however, is very much greater. If 100 human\r\nbeings with desk calculators were set to work 8 hours a day at $1.50 an\r\nhour, the cost would be $1200 a day, or 8 times as much. Yet it is very\r\ndoubtful that the work they could produce would equal that turned out\r\nby the machine, either in quality or quantity, when the machine is well\r\nsuited to the problem.\r\n\r\n\r\nReliability\r\n\r\nBy reliability we mean the extent to which the results produced by the\r\nmachine can be relied on to be right. The machine contains no built-in\r\ndevice for making its operations reliable. So, if we wish to check a\r\nmultiplication, for example, we can do the multiplication a second\r\ntime, interchanging the multiplier and the multiplicand. But if, say,\r\ndigit 16 of the product were not transferring correctly, we would get\r\nthe same wrong result both ways and we would not have a sufficient\r\ncheck. Thus, when we set up a problem for the machine to do, one of the\r\nbig tasks we have is checking. We have to work out ways of making sure\r\nthat the result, when we get it, is right and ways of instructing the\r\nmachine to make the tests we want. This is not a new task. Whenever\r\nyou or I set out to solve a problem, we have to make sure—usually by\r\ndoing the problem twice, and preferably by doing it a different way the\r\nsecond time—that our answer, when we get it, is correct. One of the\r\nchief tasks for the mathematician, in making a sequence-control tape\r\nfor the machine, is to put into it sufficient checks to make sure that\r\nthe results are correct.\r\n\r\nWe can use a number of different kinds of partial checks: the check\r\ncounter; _differences_, and _smoothness_ (see Supplement 2); watching\r\nthe results printed on typewriter 1; mathematical checks; comparison\r\nwith known specific values; etc.\r\n\r\nIn actual experience on the machine, human failures, such as failure\r\nto state the problem exactly or failure to put it on the machine\r\ncorrectly, have given about as much trouble as mechanical failures. The\r\nmachine operates without mechanical failure about 90 to 95 per cent\r\nof the time. The balance of the time the machine is idle while being\r\nserviced or repaired. The machine is serviced by mechanics trained and\r\nsupervised at Harvard.\r\n\r\nOften when we change the machine from one problem to another problem,\r\nwe find some kind of trouble. Consequently, we need to work out in\r\ndetail the first part of any calculation placed on the machine. We\r\nthen compare the results step by step with the results produced by the\r\nmachine. Any mathematician working with the machine needs considerable\r\ntraining in order to diagnose trouble quickly and guide the maintenance\r\nmen to the place where repair or replacement is needed. Once you find\r\nthe trouble, you can fix it easily. Without disturbing the soldered\r\nconnections, you can easily pull out from its socket a relay that is\r\nmisbehaving and plug in a new relay. With a screwdriver you can change\r\na counter position—detach it from its socket and replace it by another\r\none that is working correctly.\r\n\r\nOne “bug” that will long be remembered around the Laboratory was a case\r\ninvolving a 5 that would incorrectly come in to a number every now\r\nand then. It did not happen often—only once in a while. After a week\r\nof search the bug was finally located: the insulation on a wire that\r\ncarried a 5 had worn through in one spot, and once in a while this wire\r\nwould shake against a post that could carry current and took in the 5!\r\n\r\n\r\nEfficiency\r\n\r\nIn many respects, this machine is efficient and well-balanced. Its\r\nreading and writing speed is close to its calculating speed. We can\r\npunch or print a result on the average for every 10 additions or 1½\r\nmultiplications. The memory of 72 numbers in the machine is extremely\r\nuseful; a smaller memory is a serious limitation on the achievements of\r\na computing machine. The machine can do many kinds of arithmetic and\r\nlogic. It is well educated and can compute automatically some rather\r\ncomplicated mathematical functions, like logarithm or sine. It has done\r\ndifficult and important problems. It has computed and tabulated (see\r\nSupplement 2) _Bessel functions_, _definite integrals_, etc. It can\r\nsolve _differential equations_ (see Chapter 5) and many other problems\r\nin mathematics, physics, and engineering.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, no calculator will ever again be built just like\r\nthis one, useful though it is. Electronic computing is easily 100 times\r\nas fast as relay computing; nearly every future calculator will do\r\nits computing electronically. Many other improvements will be made.\r\nFor example, in this calculator, there are 72 addition-subtraction\r\nmechanisms, yet only one of these can be used at a time. Also, the\r\nmachine has only one combined multiply-divide unit. So we have to\r\norganize any computation with few multiplications, and with still fewer\r\ndivisions, for they take longer still.\r\n\r\nUntil 1947, we had to organize any computation in this calculator into\r\none single fixed sequence of operations. In other words, there was\r\nno way to move from one subroutine to another subroutine depending\r\non some indication that turned up in our computation. Recently, the\r\nHarvard Computation Laboratory decided to remedy this condition and\r\nprovided the Subsidiary Sequence Mechanism equivalent to 10 subroutines\r\nof 22 lines of coding each. These are on relays and plug wires and\r\nmay be called for by the sequence-control tape or by each other. This\r\nprovision has added greatly to the efficiency of the calculator.\r\n\r\nWhatever else can be said about the Harvard IBM Automatic\r\nSequence-Controlled Calculator, it must be said that this was the first\r\ngeneral-purpose mechanical brain using numbers in digit form and able\r\nto do arithmetic and logic in hundreds of thousands of steps one after\r\nanother. And great credit must go to Professor Howard H. Aiken of\r\nHarvard and the men of International Business Machines Corporation who\r\nmade this great mechanical brain come into existence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 7\r\n\r\nSPEED—5000 ADDITIONS A SECOND:\r\n\r\nMOORE SCHOOL’S ENIAC\r\n\r\n(ELECTRONIC NUMERICAL INTEGRATOR AND CALCULATOR)\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother of the giant brains that has begun to work is named _ENIAC_.\r\nThis name comes from the initial letters of the full name, _Electronic\r\nNumerical Integrator and Calculator_. Eniac was born in 1942 at\r\nthe Moore School of Electrical Engineering, of the University of\r\nPennsylvania, in Philadelphia. Eniac’s father was the Ordnance\r\nDepartment of the U. S. Army, which provided the funds to feed and rear\r\nthe prodigy.\r\n\r\nIn the short space of four years, Eniac grew to maturity, and in\r\nFebruary 1946 he began to earn his own living by electronic thinking.\r\nEniac promptly set several world’s records. He was the first giant\r\nbrain to use electronic tubes for calculating. He was the first one to\r\nreach the speed of 5000 additions a second. He was the first piece of\r\nelectronic apparatus containing as many as 18,000 electronic tubes all\r\nfunctioning together successfully. As soon as Eniac started thinking,\r\nhe promptly made relay calculators obsolete from the scientific point\r\nof view, for they have a top speed of perhaps 10 additions a second.\r\n\r\nAt the age of 5, he moved to Maryland at a cost of about $90,000, and\r\nhis permanent home is now the Ballistic Research Laboratories at the U.\r\nS. Army’s Proving Ground at Aberdeen, Md.\r\n\r\n\r\nORIGIN AND DEVELOPMENT\r\n\r\nIn the Department of Terrestrial Magnetism in the Carnegie Institution\r\nof Washington, a great deal of information about the earth is studied.\r\nMany kinds of physical observations are there gathered and analyzed:\r\nelectricity in the atmosphere, magnetism in the earth, and the weather,\r\nfor example. In 1941, a physicist, Dr. John W. Mauchly, was thinking\r\nabout the great mass of numerical information they had to handle. He\r\nbecame convinced that much swifter ways of handling these numbers were\r\nneeded. He was certain electronic devices could be used for computing\r\nat very high speeds, yet he found no one busy applying electronics in\r\nthis field. With hopes of finding some way of developing electronic\r\ncomputing, he joined the staff of the Moore School of Electrical\r\nEngineering in the autumn of 1941.\r\n\r\nThe Moore School in 1934 and 1935 had built a differential analyzer;\r\nand, from that time on, the school had made a number of improvements\r\nin it. In 1941, with war imminent, the differential analyzer was put\r\nhard at work calculating tables for the Army’s Ballistic Research\r\nLaboratories. These tables were mostly firing tables, tables of the\r\npaths along which projectiles travel when fired—_trajectories_;\r\nobviously, you cannot fire a gun usefully, unless you know how to aim\r\nit. The amount of calculation of trajectories was so huge that Dr.\r\nMauchly suggested that a machine using electronic tubes be constructed\r\nto calculate them. A good deal of discussion took place between men at\r\nthe Moore School, men at the Ballistic Research Laboratories, and men\r\nfrom the Ordnance Department in Washington. A contract for research\r\ninto an electronic trajectory computer was concluded with the Ordnance\r\nDepartment of the U. S. Army. Mauchly and one of the young electronics\r\nengineers studying at Moore School, J. Presper Eckert, Jr., set to work\r\non the design.\r\n\r\nGradually the design of a machine took form, and the crucial\r\nexperiments on equipment were completed. In 1943, the design was\r\nsettled as a special-purpose machine to calculate trajectories. Later\r\non, the group modified the plans here and there to enable the machine\r\nto calculate a very wide class of problems. A group of Moore School\r\nelectronics engineers and technicians during 1944 and 1945 built the\r\nmachine, using as much as possible standard radio tubes and parts.\r\nHere, again, in spite of the successful progress of the electronic\r\nmachine, the rumor that it was a “white elephant” was allowed to spread\r\nin order to protect the work from prying enemy ears.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL ORGANIZATION\r\n\r\nThe main part of Eniac consists of 42 _panels_, which are placed along\r\nthe sides of a square U. Each of these panels is 9 feet high, 2 feet\r\nwide, and 1 foot thick. They are of sheet steel, painted black, with\r\nswitches, lights, etc., mounted on them. At the tops of all the panels\r\nare air ducts for drawing off the hot air around the tubes. Large\r\nmotors and fans above the machine suck the heated air away through the\r\nducts. There are also 5 pieces of equipment which can be rolled from\r\nplace to place and are called _portable_, but there is no choice as to\r\nwhere they can be plugged in. We shall call this equipment panels 43 to\r\n47.\r\n\r\n\r\nPanels\r\n\r\nNow what are these panels, and what do they do? Each panel is an\r\nassembly of some equipment. The names of the panels are shown in the\r\naccompanying table. The arrangement of Eniac at the Ballistic Research\r\nLaboratories as shown in the table is slightly different from the\r\narrangement of Eniac at Moore School.\r\n\r\nNAMES OF PANELS OF ENIAC\r\n\r\n     PANEL NO.

Some of the explanation we can give in the summary of the\r\nunits of Eniac:\r\n\r\nSUMMARY OF UNITS OF ENIAC\r\n\r\n    QUANTITY       DEVICE                        SIGNIFICANCE\r\n\r\n    20  Accumulators           Store, add, and subtract numbers\r\n    1   Multiplier             Multiplies\r\n    1   Divider-Square-Rooter  Divides, and obtains twice the _square\r\n                                 root_ of a number (see Supplement 2)\r\n    3   Function Tables        Part of the memory, for referring to\r\n                                 tables of numbers\r\n    1   Constant Transmitter   Stores numbers from the card reader and\r\n                                 from hand-set switches\r\n    1   Printer                Punches machine results into cards\r\n    1   Cycling Unit           Controls the timing of the various parts\r\n                                 of the machine\r\n    1   Initiating Unit        Has controls for starting a calculation,\r\n                                 for clearing, etc.\r\n    1   Master Programmer      Holds the chief controls for coordinating\r\n                                  the various parts of the machine\r\n\r\nAn _accumulator_ is a storage counter. It can hold a number; it\r\ncan clear a number; it can transmit a number either positively or\r\nnegatively; and it can receive a number by adding the number in and\r\nthus holding the sum of what it held before and the number received.\r\nEniac when first built had only 20 accumulators, and so it could\r\nremember only 20 numbers at one time (except for constant numbers set\r\nin switches). This small memory was the most serious drawback of Eniac;\r\npanel 26 was designed, therefore, to provide a great additional memory\r\ncapacity.\r\n\r\nThe _divider-square-rooter_, as its name tells, is a mechanism that\r\ncan divide and that can find twice the square root of a number. Eniac\r\nis one of the several giant brains that have had square root capacity\r\nbuilt into them, particularly since square root is needed for solving\r\ntrajectories.\r\n\r\nMany panels of Eniac have double duty and some have triple duty.\r\nFor example, panel 24 is an accumulator, but it also (1) stores the\r\nright-hand partial products (see Supplement 2) of the multiplier\r\nand (2) was a register, when Eniac was at Moore School, from which\r\ninformation to be punched in the printer could be obtained. Clearly, if\r\nwe have a multiplication to do, we cannot also use this accumulator for\r\nstoring a number that is to remain unchanged during the multiplication.\r\n\r\n\r\nParts\r\n\r\nThe total number of parts in Eniac is near half a million, even if\r\nwe count electronic tubes as single parts. There are over 18,800\r\nelectronic tubes in the machine. It is interesting to note that only 10\r\nkinds of electronic tubes are used in the calculating circuits and only\r\nabout 60 kinds of _resistors_ and 30 kinds of _capacitors_. A resistor\r\nis a device that opposes the steady flow of electric current through\r\nit to a certain extent (called _resistance_ and measured in _ohms_). A\r\ncapacitor is a device that can store electrical energy up to a certain\r\nextent (called _capacitance_ and measured in _farads_). All these tubes\r\nand parts are standard parts in radios. All types are identified by the\r\ncolor labels established in standard radio manufacturing. It is the\r\ncombinations of these parts, like the combinations of pieces in a chess\r\ngame, that give rise to the marvelous powers of Eniac.\r\n\r\nThe combinations of parts at the first level are called _plug-in\r\nunits_. A plug-in unit is a standard box or tray or chassis made\r\nof sheet steel containing a standard assembly of tubes, wires, and\r\nother parts. It can be pushed in or pulled out of a standard socket\r\nwith many connections. An example of a plug-in unit is a _decade_,\r\nor, more exactly, an _accumulator decade_. This is just a counter\r\nwheel or decimal position expressed in Eniac language: it can express\r\nsuccessively all the digits from 0 to 9 and then pass from 9 to 0,\r\ngiving rise to a carry impulse. It is striking that a mechanical\r\ncounter to hold 10 digits can be made up of 10 little wheels, ¼ inch\r\nwide and an inch high. But an accumulator in Eniac, to hold 10 digits,\r\nis a set of 10 decades each 2 inches wide and 2½ feet high.\r\n\r\nThere are only about 20 kinds of plug-in units altogether. Each plug-in\r\nunit is interchangeable with any other of the same kind. So, if a\r\ndecade, for example, shows trouble, you can pull it out of its socket\r\nand plug in a spare decade instead.\r\n\r\n\r\nNumbers\r\n\r\nNumbers in Eniac are of 10 decimal digits with a sign that may be plus\r\nor minus. The decimal point is fixed. However, when you are connecting\r\none accumulator with another, you can shift the decimal point if you\r\nwant to. Also, 2 accumulators may be coupled together so as to handle\r\nnumbers of 20 digits.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW INFORMATION GOES INTO THE MACHINE\r\n\r\nThere are three ways by which information—numbers or instructions—can\r\ngo into the Eniac. Numbers can be put into the machine by means of\r\npunch cards fed into the Card Reader, panel 46, or switches on the\r\nConstant Transmitter, panels 37 to 39. Numbers or instructions can\r\nalso go into the machine by means of the Function Tables, panels 43 to\r\n45. Here there are dial switches, which are set by hand. Instructions\r\ncan also go into the machine by setting the switches, plugging the\r\ninputs and outputs, etc., of the wires or lines along which numbers and\r\ninstructions travel.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW INFORMATION COMES OUT OF THE MACHINE\r\n\r\nThere are two ways by which numerical information can come out of\r\nthe machine. Numbers can come out of the machine punched on cards by\r\nthe Summary Punch, panel 47. They are then printed in another room by\r\nmeans of a separate IBM tabulator. Also, numbers can be read out of\r\nthe machine by means of the lights in the _neon bulbs_ mounted on each\r\naccumulator. You can read in the lights of a panel the number held by\r\nthe accumulator, if the panel is not computing.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW INFORMATION IS MANIPULATED IN THE MACHINE\r\n\r\nEniac handles information rather differently from any other of the big\r\nbrains. Instead of having only one bus or “railroad line” along which\r\nnumbers can be sent, Eniac has more than 10 such lines. They are called\r\n_digit trays_ and labeled A, B, C, ···. Each contains 11 _digit trunk\r\nlines_ or _digit trunks_—10 to carry the digits of a number, and the\r\n11th to carry the sign. Instead of having only one telegraph line along\r\nwhich instructions can be sent, Eniac has more than 100 such lines.\r\nThey are called _program trunk lines_ or _program trunks_ and labeled\r\nA1, A2, ···, A11, B1, B2, ···, B11, ···, etc. They are assembled in\r\ngroups of 11 to a tray; the _program trays_, in fact, look just like\r\nthe digit trays, except for their connectors and their purpose, which\r\nare different. Below, we shall make clear how the program trays carry\r\ncontrol information.\r\n\r\nNow, actually, Eniac has many more trunk lines than we have just\r\nstated, for each of the lines we have mentioned can be divided into\r\nnumerous separate sections by the removal of plug connections. How\r\nwe choose to do this depends on the needs of the problem, the space\r\nbetween the panels, the time when the line is used, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nTransferring Numbers, Adding, and Subtracting\r\n\r\nBasically, a number is represented in Eniac by an arrangement of on\r\nand off electronic tube elements in pairs, called _flip-flops_. There\r\nis one flip-flop enclosed in a single tube (type 6SN7) for each value\r\n0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 for each of the 10 digits stored in an\r\naccumulator. So we have at least 100 flip-flops for each accumulator,\r\nand thus at least 100 electronic tubes are required to store 10 digits.\r\nActually, an accumulator needs 550 electronic tubes. So we see that\r\nthere is not very much of a future in this type of arrangement. The\r\nnewer electronic brains use different devices for storage of numbers.\r\n\r\nIn order to show what number is stored in an accumulator, there are 100\r\nlittle neon bulbs mounted on the face of each accumulator panel. Each\r\nbulb glows when the flip-flop that belongs to it is on. For example,\r\nsuppose that the 4th decade in Accumulator 11 holds the digit 7. Then\r\nthe 7th flip-flop in that decade will be on, and all the others will be\r\noff. The 7th neon bulb for that decade will glow.\r\n\r\nNow suppose that the number 7 is in the 4th decade in Accumulator 11\r\nand is to be added into, say, the 4th decade in Accumulator 13. And\r\nsuppose that it is to be subtracted from the 4th decade in Accumulator\r\n16. What do we do, and what will Eniac do?\r\n\r\nFirst, we pick out 2 digit trays, say B and D. Accumulator 11 has 2\r\noutputs, called the _add output_ and the _subtract output_. We plug B\r\ninto the add output and D into the subtract output. Then we go over to\r\nAccumulators 13 and 16. They have 5 inputs, that is, 5 ways of being\r\nplugged to receive numbers from digit trunks. These inputs are named\r\nwith _Greek letters_, α, β, γ, δ, ε. We choose one input, say γ, for\r\nAccumulator 13, and we plug B into that input. We choose one input, say\r\nε, for Accumulator 16, and we plug D into that input.\r\n\r\nNow we have the “railroad” switching for numbers accomplished. We\r\nhave set up a channel whereby the number in Accumulator 11 will be\r\nrouted positively into Accumulator 13 and negatively into Accumulator\r\n16. Now let us suppose that, at some definite time fixed by the\r\ncontrol, Accumulator 11 is stimulated to transmit and Accumulators\r\n13 and 16 are conditioned to receive. When this happens, a group of\r\n10 _pulses_ comes along a direct trunk from the cycling unit, and a\r\ngroup of 9 pulses comes along another trunk. We can think of each\r\npulse as a little surge of electricity lasting about 2 millionths\r\nof a second. The _ten-pulses_, as the first group is called, are 10\r\nmillionths of a second apart. The _nine-pulses_, as the second group\r\nis called, are also 10 millionths of a second apart but are sandwiched\r\nbetween the ten-pulses. When the 1st ten-pulse comes along, the 7th\r\nflip-flop in Accumulator 11 goes off, the 8th flip-flop goes on, the\r\nfollowing nine-pulse goes through and goes out on the subtract line to\r\nAccumulator 16. Then the 2nd ten-pulse comes along, the 8th flip-flop\r\ngoes off, the 9th flip-flop goes on, and the next nine-pulse goes out\r\non the subtract line to Accumulator 16. Now the decade sits at 9,\r\nand for this reason the next ten-pulse changes an electronic switch\r\n(actually another flip-flop) so that all later nine-pulses will go\r\nout on the add line. This ten-pulse also turns off the 9th flip-flop\r\nand turns on the 0th flip-flop without causing any carry. Now the 4th\r\nof the ten-pulses comes along, turns the 0th flip-flop off, and turns\r\nthe 1st flip-flop on, and the next nine-pulse goes out on the add line\r\nto Accumulator 13. The next 6 of the ten-pulses then come along and\r\nchange Accumulator 11 back to the digit 7 as before, and the next 6\r\nof the nine-pulses go out to Accumulator 13. Thus Eniac has added 7\r\ninto Accumulator 13, has added 2, the _nines complement_ of 7 (see\r\nSupplement 2), into Accumulator 16, and has left Accumulator 11 holding\r\nthe same number as before. This is just the result that we wanted.\r\n\r\nIn this way, the nines complement of any digit in a decade is\r\ntransferred out along the subtract line, and the digit unchanged is\r\ntransmitted out along the add line. As the pulses arrive at any other\r\naccumulator, they add into that accumulator.\r\n\r\n\r\nMultiplying and Dividing\r\n\r\nEniac performs multiplication by a built-in table of the products in\r\nthe 10-by-10 multiplication table, using the method of _left-hand\r\ncomponents_ and _right-hand components_ (see Supplement 2). For\r\nexample, suppose that the 3rd digit of the multiplier is 7 and that the\r\n5th digit of the multiplicand is 6. Then, when Eniac attends to the\r\n3rd digit of the multiplier, the right-hand digit of the 42 = 6 × 7 is\r\ngathered in one accumulator, and the left-hand digit 4 is gathered in\r\nanother accumulator. After Eniac has attended to all the digits of the\r\nmultiplier, then Eniac performs one more addition and transfers the sum\r\nof the left-hand digits into the right-hand digits accumulator.\r\n\r\nEniac does division in rather a novel way. First, the divisor is\r\nsubtracted over and over until the result becomes negative or 0. Then\r\nthe machine shifts to the next column and adds the divisor until the\r\nresult becomes positive or 0. It continues this process, alternating\r\nfrom column to column. For example, suppose that we divide 3 into 84 in\r\nthis way. We have:\r\n\r\n      ______  _\r\n    3 ) 84 ( 32\r\n       -3\r\n       ——\r\n       +54\r\n       -3\r\n       ——\r\n       +24\r\n       -3\r\n       ——\r\n        -6\r\n        +3\r\n        ——\r\n        -3\r\n        +3\r\n        ——\r\n         0\r\n\r\nAfter we subtract 3 the third time, the result becomes negative,-6;\r\nin the next column, after we add 3 twice, the result becomes 0. The\r\nquotient is\r\n\r\n     _\r\n    32, which is the same as 30 - 2, or 28;\r\n\r\nand 3 × 28 is 84. Thus the process checks.\r\n\r\n\r\nConsulting a Table\r\n\r\nEniac has three Function Tables. Here you can store numbers or\r\ninstructions for the machine to refer to. Each Function Table has\r\n104 _arguments_ (see Supplement 2). For each argument, you can store\r\n12 digits and 2 signs that may be plus or minus. This capacity can\r\nbe devoted to one 12-digit number with a sign, or to two 6-digit\r\nnumbers each with a sign, or to six 2-digit instructions. The three\r\nFunction Tables are panels 43, 44, and 45. To put in the numbers or\r\ninstructions, you have to go over to these panels and set the numbers\r\nor instructions, digit by digit, turning dial switches by hand. It is\r\nslow and hard to do this right, but once it is done, Eniac can refer\r\nto any number or instruction in any table in ¹/₁₀₀₀ of a second. This\r\nis much faster than the table reference time in any other of the giant\r\nbrains built up to 1948.\r\n\r\n\r\nProgramming\r\n\r\nWe said above that Eniac has over 100 control lines or program trunks\r\nalong which instructions can be sent. These instructions are expressed\r\nas pulses called _program pulses_. Now how do we make these pulses do\r\nwhat we want them to do? For example, how can we instruct Accumulator\r\n11 to add what it holds into Accumulator 13?\r\n\r\nOn each unit of Eniac there are plug hubs or sockets (called\r\n_program-pulse input terminals_) to which a program trunk may be\r\nconnected. A program pulse received here can make the unit act in some\r\ndesired way. On each accumulator of Eniac, we find 12 program-pulse\r\ninput hubs. Corresponding to each of these hubs, there is a nine-way\r\nswitch, called a _program-control switch_. The setting of this switch\r\ndetermines what the accumulator will do when the program-pulse input\r\nhub belonging to the switch receives a program pulse. For instance,\r\nthere are switch settings for: receive input on the α line, receive\r\ninput on the β line, etc.; and transmit output on the add line, etc.\r\nThere is even a switch setting that instructs the accumulator to do\r\nnothing, and this instruction may be both useful and important.\r\n\r\nNow, in order that Accumulator 11 may transfer a number to Accumulator\r\n13, we need: (1) a digit tray, say B, for the number to travel along;\r\n(2) a program trunk line, say G3, to tell Accumulator 11 when to send\r\nthe number and Accumulator 13 when to receive it; and (3) certain\r\nplugging as follows:\r\n\r\n    1. We plug from program trunk G3 into a program-pulse\r\n       input hub, say No. 5, of Accumulator 11;\r\n\r\n    2. We plug from the same program trunk G3 into a\r\n       program-pulse input hub, say No. 7, of Accumulator 13;\r\n\r\n    3. We set program-control switch No. 5 of Accumulator\r\n       11 to “add”;\r\n\r\n    4. We set program-control switch No. 7 of Accumulator\r\n       13 to some input, say γ.\r\n\r\n    5. We plug from digit tray B into the add output of\r\n       Accumulator 11.\r\n\r\n    6. We plug from digit tray B into the γ input of\r\n       Accumulator 13.\r\n\r\nNow, when the program pulse comes along line G3, it makes Accumulator\r\n13 transmit additively along digit tray B into Accumulator 13. And that\r\nis the result that we wanted.\r\n\r\nAs each mechanism of Eniac finishes what it is instructed to do, it\r\nmay or may not put out a program pulse. This pulse in turn may be\r\nplugged into any other program trunk line and may stimulate another\r\nmechanism to act. Then, when this mechanism finishes, it too may or may\r\nnot put out a program pulse, and so on.\r\n\r\nIn general, there are two different ways to instruct Eniac to do a\r\nproblem. One way is to set all the switches, plug all the connections,\r\netc., for the specific problem. This is a long and hard task. Very\r\noften, even with great care, it is done not quite correctly, and\r\nthen the settings must be carefully checked all over again. A second\r\nmethod (called the _von Neumann programming method_) is to store all\r\nthe instructions for a problem in one or two function tables of Eniac\r\nand then tell Eniac to read the function tables in sequence and to do\r\nwhat they say. The rest of the machine is then wired up in a standard\r\nfashion. This method of instructing Eniac was proposed by Dr. John von\r\nNeumann of the Institute of Advanced Study at Princeton, N. J. Eniac\r\nhas been modified to the slight extent needed so that this method can\r\nbe used when desired. In this method, each instruction is a selected\r\none of 60 different standard instructions or orders—one of them, for\r\nexample, being “multiplication.” Each standard order is expressed by\r\n2 decimal digits. The 60 standard orders are sufficient so that Eniac\r\ncan do any mathematical problem that does not overstrain its capacity.\r\nSince each of the 3 Function Tables can hold 600 2-digit instructions,\r\nthe machine can hold a program of 1800 instructions under the von\r\nNeumann programming method.\r\n\r\n\r\nAN APPRAISAL OF ENIAC AS A COMPUTER\r\n\r\nAs a general-purpose calculating machine, Eniac suffers from unbalance.\r\nThat is to say, Eniac operates rapidly and successfully in some\r\nrespects, and slowly and troublesomely in other respects. This is\r\naltogether to be expected, however, in a calculator as novel as Eniac\r\nand made to so large an extent out of standard radio parts. It was\r\ncertainly better to finish a calculator like this one and then start\r\non a new one, as the Moore School of Electrical Engineering did, than\r\nto prolong design and construction indefinitely in order to make\r\nimprovements.\r\n\r\n\r\nSpeed\r\n\r\nEniac adds or subtracts very swiftly at the rate of 5000 a second.\r\nEniac multiplies at the rate of 360 to 500 a second. Division,\r\nhowever, is slow, relatively; the rate is about 50 a second. Reading\r\nnumbers from punched cards, 12 a second for 10-digit numbers, is even\r\nslower. As a result of these rates, you find, when you put a problem\r\non Eniac, that one division delays you as long as 100 additions or\r\n8 multiplications. Division might have been speeded somewhat by\r\n(1) _rapidly convergent approximation_ (see Supplement 2) to the\r\n_reciprocal_ of the divisor and (2) multiplying by the dividend; this\r\nmight have taken 5 or 6 multiplication times instead of 8. Also, the\r\nuse of a standard IBM punch-card feed and card punch slows the machine\r\ngreatly. One way to overcome this drawback might be to install one or\r\ntwo additional sets of such equipment, which might increase input and\r\noutput speed.\r\n\r\n\r\nEase of Programming\r\n\r\nEniac has a very rapid and flexible automatic control over the\r\nprogramming of operations. Eniac has more than 10 channels along which\r\nnumbers can be transferred and more than 100 channels along which\r\nprogram-control pulses can be transferred. There are many ways for\r\nproviding subroutines. Eniac has the additional advantage that there\r\nis no delay in giving the machine successive instructions: all the\r\ninstructions the machine may need at any time are ready at the start of\r\nthe problem, and indications occurring in the calculation can change\r\nthe routine completely.\r\n\r\nAll these advantages, however, are paid for rather heavily by the\r\nslow methods for changing programming. You have to plug large numbers\r\nof program trunk lines and digit trunk lines, or you have to set\r\nlarge numbers of switches, or both. Also, when you wish to return to\r\na previous problem, you must do all the plugging and switch setting\r\nover again. Many delays in the operation of the machine are due to\r\nhuman errors in setting the machine for a new problem. Here again, we\r\nmust remember that Eniac was originally designed as a special-purpose\r\nmachine for solving trajectories. To calculate a large family of\r\ntrajectories very little changing of wires and switches would be\r\nneeded.\r\n\r\n\r\nMemory\r\n\r\nThe most severe limitation on the usefulness of Eniac was, at the\r\noutset, the fact that it had only 20 registers for storing numbers.\r\nThere are large numbers of problems that cannot be simply handled with\r\nso small an internal memory. Even the Harvard IBM calculator (see\r\nChapter 6) is often strained during a problem because of the number of\r\nintermediate results that must be stored for a time before combining.\r\nThe Ballistic Research Laboratories, however, contracted for extensions\r\nto Eniac to provide more memory and easier changing of instructions.\r\n\r\n\r\nReliability\r\n\r\nChecking results with Eniac is not easy. There is no built-in guarantee\r\nthat Eniac’s results are correct. A large calculator can and does make\r\nboth constant and intermittent errors. Ways for checking with Eniac are:\r\n\r\n    Mathematical, if and when available, and this will be\r\n      seldom.\r\n\r\n    Running the problem a second time, and this will, at\r\n      most, prove consistency.\r\n\r\n    Deliberate testing of small parts of the problem,\r\n      which is very useful and is standard practice but\r\n      leads only to a probability that the final result is\r\n      correct.\r\n\r\nYou can operate Eniac one addition at a time, and even one pulse at a\r\ntime, and see what the machine shows in its little neon bulbs. This is\r\na very useful partial check.\r\n\r\n\r\nCost\r\n\r\nThe cost of Eniac is higher than that of some of the other large\r\nmechanical brains—over half a million dollars. Because some of the\r\nwork was done at the Moore School by students, the cost was probably\r\nless than it otherwise would have been. The largest part of the cost\r\nwas the designing of the machine and the construction of the panels;\r\nthe tubes were only a small portion of the cost. The tubes used in\r\nthe calculating circuits cost only 20 to 90 cents. However, no later\r\nelectronic calculator need cost as much, for many improvements can now\r\nbe seen.\r\n\r\nThe power required for Eniac is about 150 kilowatts or about 200\r\nhorsepower, most of which is used for the heaters of the electronic\r\ntubes. The largest number of electronic tubes mentioned for future\r\nelectronic calculators is about 3000, so we can see that they are\r\nlikely to use less than a quarter of the power needed for Eniac.\r\n\r\nEniac will doubtless give a number of years of successful operation\r\nand be extremely useful for problems that employ its assets and are\r\nnot excluded by its limitations. In fact, at the Ballistic Research\r\nLaboratories, for a typical week of actual work, Eniac has already\r\nproved to be equal to 500 human computers working 40 hours with desk\r\ncalculating machines, and it appears that soon two or three times as\r\nmuch work may be obtained from Eniac.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 8\r\n\r\nRELIABILITY—NO WRONG RESULTS:\r\n\r\nBELL LABORATORIES’ GENERAL-PURPOSE RELAY CALCULATOR\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1946, Bell Telephone Laboratories in New York finished two\r\n_general-purpose relay calculators_—mechanical brains. They were twins.\r\nOne was shipped in July 1946 to the National Advisory Committee for\r\nAeronautics at Langley Field, Virginia. The other, after some months of\r\ntrial operation, was shipped in February 1947 to the Ballistic Research\r\nLaboratories at the U. S. Army’s Proving Ground, Aberdeen, Md.\r\n\r\nEach machine is remarkably reliable and versatile. It can do a wide\r\nvariety of calculations in a great many different ways. Yet the machine\r\nnever takes a new step without a check that the old step was correctly\r\nperformed. There is, therefore, a chance of better than 99.999,999,999\r\nper cent that the machine will not let a wrong result come out. The\r\nautomatic checking, of course, does not prevent (1) human mistakes—for\r\nexample, instructing the machine incorrectly—or (2) mechanical\r\nfailures, in which the machine stops dead in its tracks, letting no\r\nresult at all come out.\r\n\r\n\r\nORIGIN AND DEVELOPMENT\r\n\r\nIn Bell Telephone Laboratories the telephone system of the country is\r\ncontinually studied. Their research produced the common type of dial\r\ntelephone system: a masterly machine for selecting information.\r\n\r\nNow when a telephone engineer studies an electric circuit, he often\r\nfinds it very convenient to use numbers in pairs: like 2, 5 or-4,-1.\r\nHere the comma is a separation sign to keep the two numbers in the pair\r\nseparate and in sequence. Mathematicians call numbers of this kind, for\r\nno very good reason, _complex numbers_; of course, they are far less\r\ncomplex than why the sun shines or why plants grow.\r\n\r\nWhen Bell Laboratories test the design of new circuits, girl computers\r\ndo arithmetic with complex numbers. Addition and subtraction are\r\neasy: each means two operations of addition or subtraction of\r\nordinary numbers. For example, 2, 5, plus-4,-1 equals 2-4, 5-1, which\r\nequals-2, 4. And 2, 5 minus-4,-1 is the same as 2, 5 plus 4, 1; and\r\nthis equals 2 + 4, 5 + 1, which equals 6, 6. Multiplication of two\r\ncomplex numbers, however, is more work. If _a_, _b_ and _c_, _d_ are\r\ntwo complex numbers, then the formula for their product is (_a_ ×\r\n_c_)-(_b_ × _d_), (_a_ × _d_) + (_b_ × _c_). To get the answer, we\r\nneed 4 multiplications, 1 subtraction, and 1 addition. Division of two\r\ncomplex numbers requires even more work. If _a_, _b_ and _c_, _d_ are\r\ntwo complex numbers, the formula for the quotient of _a_, _b_ divided\r\nby _c_, _d_ is:\r\n\r\n    [(_a_ × _c_) + (_b_ × _d_)] ÷ [(_c_ × _c_) + (_d_ × _d_)],\r\n\r\n    [(_b_ × _c_) - (_a_ × _d_)] ÷ [(_c_ × _c_) + (_d_ × _d_)]\r\n\r\nFor example,\r\n\r\n    (2, 5) ÷ (-4, -1) = [(2 × -4 = -8) + (5 × -1 = -5)]\r\n           ÷ [(-4 × -4 = 16) + (-1 × -1 = 1)],\r\n\r\n    [(5 × -4 = -20) - (2 × -1 = -2)] ÷ [16 + 1] = -(¹³/₁₇), -(¹⁸/₁₇)\r\n\r\nThus, division of one complex number by another needs 6\r\nmultiplications, 2 additions, 1 subtraction, and 2 divisions of\r\nordinary numbers—and always in the same pattern or sequence.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Complex Computer\r\n\r\nAbout 1939, an engineer at Bell Telephone Laboratories in New York, Dr.\r\nGeorge R. Stibitz, noticed the great volume of this pattern arithmetic.\r\nHe began to wonder why telephone switching equipment could not be used\r\nto do the multiplications and divisions automatically. He decided it\r\ncould. All that was necessary was that the _relays_ (see Chapter 2)\r\nused in regular telephone equipment should have a way of remembering\r\nand calculating with numbers. Regular telephone equipment would take\r\ncare of the proper sequence of operations. Regular equipment known as\r\n_teletypewriters_ would print the numbers of the answer when it was\r\nobtained. A teletypewriter consists essentially of a typewriter that\r\nmay be operated by electrical impulses. It has a keyboard that may\r\nproduce electrical impulses in sets corresponding to letters; and it\r\ncan receive or transmit over wires.\r\n\r\nDr. Stibitz _coded_ the numbers: each decimal digit was matched up with\r\na group of four relays in sequence, and each of these relays could be\r\nopen or closed. If 0 means open and 1 means closed, here is the pattern\r\nor code that he used:\r\n\r\n    DECIMAL DIGIT   RELAY CODE\r\n          0          0 0 1 1\r\n          1          0 1 0 0\r\n          2          0 1 0 1\r\n          3          0 1 1 0\r\n          4          0 1 1 1\r\n\r\n          5          1 0 0 0\r\n          6          1 0 0 1\r\n          7          1 0 1 0\r\n          8          1 0 1 1\r\n          9          1 1 0 0\r\n\r\nWith regular telephone relays and regular telephone company techniques,\r\nDr. Stibitz and Bell Telephone Laboratories designed and constructed\r\nthe machine. It was called the _Complex Computer_ and was built just\r\nfor multiplying and dividing complex numbers. Six or eight panels of\r\nrelays and wires were in one room. Two floors away, some of the girl\r\ncomputers sat in another room, where one of the teletypewriters of\r\nthe machine was located. When they wished, they could type into the\r\nmachine’s teletypewriter the numbers to be multiplied or divided. In a\r\nfew seconds back would come the answer. In fact, there were two more\r\ncomputing rooms where teletypewriters of the machine were stationed. To\r\nprevent conflicts between stations, the machine had a circuit like the\r\nbusy signal from a telephone.\r\n\r\nIn 1940, a demonstration of the Complex Computer took place: the\r\ncomputing panels remained in New York, but the teletypewriter\r\ninput-output station was set up at Dartmouth College in Hanover, N. H.\r\nMathematicians gave problems to the machine in Dartmouth, it solved\r\nthem in New York, and it reported the answers in Dartmouth.\r\n\r\n\r\nSpecial-Purpose Computers\r\n\r\nWith this as a beginning, Bell Laboratories developed another machine\r\nfor a wide variety of mathematical processes called _interpolating_\r\n(see Supplement 2). Then, during World War II, Bell Laboratories made\r\nmore special-purpose computing machines. They were used in military\r\nlaboratories charged with testing the accuracy of instruments for\r\ncontrolling the fire of guns. These computers took in a set of\r\ngun-aiming directions put out by the _fire-control instrument_ in\r\nsome test. They also took in the set of observations that went into\r\nthe fire-control instrument on that test. Then they computed the\r\ndifferences between the gun-aiming produced by the fire-control\r\ninstrument and the gun-aiming really required by the observations.\r\nUsing these differences, the fire-control instrument could be adjusted\r\nand corrected. These special-purpose computers were also useful in\r\nchecking the design of new fire-control instruments and in checking\r\nchanges due to new types of guns or explosives.\r\n\r\nRegularly, after each of these special-purpose computers was finished,\r\npeople began to put other problems on it. It seemed to be fated that,\r\nas soon as you had made a machine for one purpose, you wanted to use\r\nit for something else. Accordingly, in 1944, two agencies of the U. S.\r\nGovernment together made a contract with Bell Telephone Laboratories\r\nfor two general-purpose relay computers. These two machines were\r\nfinished in 1946 and are twins.\r\n\r\n\r\nORGANIZATION OF THE GENERAL-PURPOSE COMPUTER\r\n\r\nWhen a man sits down at a desk to work on a computation, he has six\r\nthings on his desk to work with: a work sheet; a desk calculator, to\r\nadd, subtract, multiply, and divide; some rules to be followed; the\r\ntables of numbers he will need; the data for the problem; and an answer\r\nsheet. In his head, he has the capacity to make decisions and to do\r\nhis work in a certain sequence of steps. These seven subdivisions of\r\ncalculation are all found in the Bell Laboratories’ general-purpose\r\nrelay computer. The general-purpose computer is a computing system, in\r\nfact, more than it is a single machine. The part of the system which\r\ndoes the actual calculating is called, in the following paragraphs,\r\nthe _computer_, or else, since it is in two halves, _Computer 1_ and\r\n_Computer 2_.\r\n\r\n\r\nPhysical Units\r\n\r\nThe computing system delivered to the Ballistic Research Laboratories\r\nfills a room about 30 by 40 feet and consists of the following:\r\n\r\n    2 _computers_: panels of relays, wiring, etc.,\r\n      which add, subtract, multiply, divide, select,\r\n      decide, control, etc.\r\n\r\n    4 _problem positions_: tables each holding 12\r\n      mechanisms for feeding paper tape, which read numbers\r\n      and instructions punched on tape and convert them\r\n      into electrical impulses.\r\n\r\n    2 _hand perforators_: keyboard devices for\r\n      punching instructions and numbers on paper tape.\r\n\r\n    1 _processor_: a table holding mechanisms for\r\n      feeding 2 paper tapes and punching a third paper\r\n      tape, used for checking numbers and instructions\r\n      punched on tape.\r\n\r\n    2 _recorders_: each a table holding a\r\n      teletypewriter, a tape punch, and a tape feed, used\r\n      for recording answers and, if necessary, consulting\r\n      them again.\r\n\r\nThe 2 computers correspond to the work sheet, the desk calculator,\r\nand the man’s capacity to make decisions and to carry out a sequence\r\nof steps. The 4 problem positions correspond to the problem data, the\r\nrules, and the tables of numbers. The 2 recorders correspond to the\r\nanswer sheet. The 2 hand perforators and the processor are auxiliary\r\nmachines: they translate the ordinary language of arithmetic into the\r\nmachine language of punched holes in paper tape.\r\n\r\nThis is the computing system as organized for the Ballistic Research\r\nLaboratories at Aberdeen. The one for the National Advisory Committee\r\nfor Aeronautics has only 3 problem positions. The computer system may,\r\nin fact, be organized with 1 to 10 computers and with 1 to 20 problem\r\npositions.\r\n\r\nThe great bulk of this computing system, like the mechanical brains\r\ndescribed in previous chapters, is made up of large numbers of\r\nidentical parts of only a few kinds. These are: standard telephone\r\nrelays; wire; and standard _teletype transmitters_, mechanisms that\r\nread punched paper tape and produce electrical impulses.\r\n\r\n\r\nNumbers\r\n\r\nThe numbers that the Bell machine contains range from 0.1000000 to\r\n0.9999999 times a _power_ of 10 varying from 10,000,000,000,000,000,000\r\nto 0.000,000,000,000,000,000,1, or, in other words, from 10¹⁹ to 10⁻¹⁹.\r\nThe machine also contains zero and _infinity_: zero arises when the\r\nnumber is smaller than 10⁻¹⁹, and infinity arises when the number is\r\nequal to or greater than 9,999,999,000,000,000,000. (See Supplement 2.)\r\n\r\nThe system used in the machine to represent numbers on relays is called\r\n_biquinary_—the _bi_-, because it is partly twofold like the hands, and\r\nthe -_quinary_ because it is partly fivefold like the fingers. This\r\nsystem is used in the abacus (see Chapter 2 and Supplement 2). In the\r\nmachine, for each decimal digit, 7 relays are used. These relays are\r\ncalled the 00 and 5 relays, and the 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 relays. If, as\r\nbefore, 0 indicates a relay that is not energized and 1 indicates a\r\nrelay that is energized, then each decimal digit is represented by the\r\npositioning of the 7 relays as follows:\r\n\r\n    DECIMAL DIGIT        RELAYS\r\n\r\n                    00 5   0 1 2 3 4\r\n\r\n          0          1 0   1 0 0 0 0\r\n          1          1 0   0 1 0 0 0\r\n          2          1 0   0 0 1 0 0\r\n          3          1 0   0 0 0 1 0\r\n          4          1 0   0 0 0 0 1\r\n\r\n          5          0 1   1 0 0 0 0\r\n          6          0 1   0 1 0 0 0\r\n          7          0 1   0 0 1 0 0\r\n          8          0 1   0 0 0 1 0\r\n          9          0 1   0 0 0 0 1\r\n\r\nThen, for any decimal digit, one and only one of the 00 and 5 relays\r\nis energized, and one and only one of the 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 relays\r\nis energized. If more or less than exactly one relay in each set is\r\nenergized, then the machine knows that it has made a mistake, and it\r\nstops dead in its tracks. Thus any accidental failure of a relay is at\r\nonce caught, and the chance of two compensating failures occurring at\r\nthe same time is extremely small.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW INFORMATION GOES INTO THE MACHINE\r\n\r\nIn order to put a problem into this machine—just as with the other\r\nmachines—first a mathematician who knows how the problem is to be\r\nsolved, and who knows how to organize it for the machine, lays out\r\nthe scheme of calculation. Then, a girl goes to one of the hand\r\nperforators. Sitting at the keyboard, she presses keys and punches out\r\nfeet or yards of paper tape expressing the instructions and numbers\r\nfor the calculation. Each character punched—digit, letter, or sign—has\r\none or more of a maximum of 6 holes across the tape. Another girl,\r\nusing the other hand perforator, also punches out the instructions and\r\nnumbers for the calculation. If she wishes to erase a wrong character,\r\nshe can press an _erase key_ that punches all 6 holes, and then the\r\nmachine will pass by this row as if it were not there.\r\n\r\nThree kinds of tapes are produced for the machine:\r\n\r\n    _Problem tapes_, which contain information\r\n       belonging to the particular problem.\r\n\r\n    _Table tapes_, which contain tables of numbers to\r\n       be referred to from time to time.\r\n\r\n    _Routine tapes_, which contain the program, or\r\n       routine, or sequence of steps that the machine is to\r\n       carry out.\r\n\r\nIn each of these tapes one character takes up ⅒ of an inch along the\r\ntape. In the case of a table tape, however, an ordinary 1-digit number\r\nrequires 4 characters on the tape, and a 7-digit number requires 11\r\ncharacters on the tape. On a table tape there will be on the average\r\nabout 1 inch of tape per number.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Processor\r\n\r\nThe two paper tapes prepared on the perforator should agree. But\r\nwhether or not they agree, a girl takes them over to the processor and\r\nputs them both in. The processor has two tape feeds, and she puts one\r\ntape on each and starts the machine. The processor compares them row by\r\nrow, making sure that they agree, and punches a new tape row by row.\r\nIf the two input tapes disagree, the processor stops. You can look to\r\nsee which tape is right, and then you can put the correct punch into\r\nthe new tape with a keyboard mounted on the processor. As the processor\r\ncompares the two input tapes, it also converts any number written in\r\nthe usual way into machine language. For example, the processor will\r\nautomatically translate 23,188 into +.231 8800 × 10⁺⁵. The processor\r\nalso puts in certain safeguards. If you want it to, the processor will\r\nalso make a printed record of a tape. Also, when a tape becomes worn\r\nfrom use in the machine, you can put it into the processor and make a\r\nfresh copy.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Problem Positions\r\n\r\nNext, the girl takes the punched tape made by the processor over to a\r\nproblem position that is idle. Two of the problem positions are always\r\nbusy guiding the two computers. The other two problem positions stand\r\nby, ready to be loaded with problems.\r\n\r\nA problem position looks like a large covered-over table. Under\r\nthe covers are 12 tape feeds, or _tape transmitters_. All these\r\ntransmitters look exactly alike except for their labels and consist\r\nof regular teletype transmitters. Six-hole paper tape can be fed into\r\nany transmitter. Six metal fingers sense the holes in the paper tape\r\nand give out electrical impulses at proper times. At the front of the\r\nproblem position is a small group of switches that provide complete\r\ncontrol over the problem while it is on the machine. These are switches\r\nfor starting, disconnecting, momentary stop, etc.\r\n\r\nOne tape transmitter is the problem tape transmitter. It takes in\r\nall the data for the problem such as the starting numbers. The first\r\nthing it does at the start of a problem is to check (by comparing tape\r\nnumbers) that the right tapes are in the right feeds.\r\n\r\nFive transmitters are routine tape transmitters. Each of these takes\r\nin the sequence of computing steps. The routine tapes also contain\r\ninformation for referring to table tapes and instructions for printing\r\nand punching tape. The machine can choose according to instructions\r\nbetween the five routine tapes and can choose between many different\r\nsections on each tape. Therefore, we can use a large number of\r\ndifferent routines in a calculation, and this capacity makes the\r\nmachine versatile and powerful.\r\n\r\nSix transmitters are table tape transmitters. They read tables of\r\nnumbers when directed to. A table tape can be as long as 100 feet and\r\nwill hold numbers at the rate of 1 inch per number, so that about 1200\r\nnumbers of seven decimal digits can be stored on a table tape.\r\n\r\nWhen we look up a number in a table, such as the following,\r\n\r\n          2½       3      3½   ···\r\n       +————————————————————————————\r\n     1 |1.02500 1.03000 1.03500\r\n     2 |1.05063 1.06090 1.07123\r\n     3 |1.07689 1.09273          ···\r\n     4 |1.10381   ···     ···\r\n     5 |1.13141   ···\r\n     6 |1.15969\r\n     7 |                  ···\r\n     8 |          ···\r\n     9 |  ···\r\n    10 |\r\n    ···|  ···\r\n\r\nwe look along the top and down the side until we find the column and\r\nrow of the number we are looking for. These are called the _arguments_\r\nof the _tabular value_ that we are looking for (see Supplement 2).\r\nNow when we put this table on a tape to go into the Bell Laboratories\r\nmachine, we write it all on one line, one figure after another, and we\r\npunch it as follows:\r\n\r\n    2-½   1-5     1.02500    1.05063    1.07689   1.10381    1.13141\r\n      6-10    1.15969      ···      11-15   ···    ···      ···    3\r\n      1-5   1.03000    1.06090    ···    ···    3½     1-5   1.03500\r\n    ···\r\n\r\nYou will notice that the column labels 2½, 3, 3½ have been put on the\r\ntape, each in front of the group of numbers they apply to. The row\r\nlabels 1 to 5, 6 to 10, ··· have also been put on the tape, each in\r\nfront of the group of numbers they apply to. The appropriate column\r\nand row numbers, or arguments, must be put often on every table tape,\r\nso that it is easy for the machine to tell what part of the table tape\r\nit is reading.\r\n\r\nIn the Bell Laboratories machine, we do not need to put equal _blocks_\r\nof arguments like 1-5, 6-10 ··· on the table tape. Instead we can put\r\nindividual arguments like 1, 2, 3, 4 ···, or, if we wish, we can use\r\nblocks of different sizes, like 1-3, 4-15, 16-30···. For some tables,\r\nsuch as income tax tables, it is very useful to have varying-sized\r\nblocks of arguments. The machine, when hunting for a certain value in\r\nthe table, makes a comparison at each block of arguments.\r\n\r\nThe machine needs about 6 seconds to search a foot of tape. If we want\r\nto set up a table economically, therefore, we need to consider the\r\naverage length of time needed for searching.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1. Scheme of a recorder.]\r\n\r\nHOW INFORMATION COMES OUT OF THE MACHINE\r\n\r\nAt either one of the two recorders (Fig. 1), information comes out of\r\nthe machine, either in the form of printed characters or as punched\r\ntape. The recorder consists of a _printer_, a _reperforator_, and\r\na tape transmitter. One recorder table belongs to each computer\r\nand records the results it computes. The printer is a regular\r\nteletypewriter connected to the machine. It translates information\r\nproduced by the machine as electrical impulses and prints the\r\ninformation in letters and digits on paper. The reperforator is an\r\nautomatic tape punch. It translates information produced by the machine\r\nin the form of electrical impulses and punches the information on\r\npaper tape. Next to the tape punch is a tape transmitter. After the\r\ntape comes through the punch, it is fed into the transmitter. Here the\r\nmachine can hunt for a previous result punched in the tape, read that\r\nresult, and use it again.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW INFORMATION IS MANIPULATED IN THE MACHINE\r\n\r\nThe main part of the computing system consists of 27 large frames\r\nloaded with relays and wiring, called the _computer_, or _Computer 1_\r\nand _Computer 2_. In this “telephone central station,” all the “phone\r\ncalls” from one number to another are attended to. There are 8 types of\r\nthese frames in the computer:\r\n\r\n     FRAMES             NUMBER\r\n\r\n    Storing register frames         6\r\n    Printer frames                  2\r\n    Problem frames                  2\r\n    Position frames                 2\r\n    Calculator frames               6\r\n    Control frames                  2\r\n    Routine frames                  4\r\n    BTL (Block-Trig-Log) frames     2\r\n    Permanent table frames          1\r\n                                   ——\r\n      Total                        27\r\n\r\nIn most but not quite all respects, the two halves, _Computer 1_ and\r\n_Computer 2_, can compute independently. The _storing register frames_\r\nhold enough relays to store 30 numbers. The registers for these\r\nnumbers are named _A, B, C, D_, ···, _M, N, O_ in two groups of 15\r\neach. One group belongs to Computer 1 and the other to Computer 2. In\r\neach Computer, the _calculator frames_ hold enough relays for storing\r\ntwo numbers (held in the _X_ and _Y_ registers) and for performing\r\naddition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and square root. In\r\neach Computer, the _problem frame_ stores the numbers that are read off\r\nthe problem tape and the table tapes, and the _printer frame_ stores\r\nthe numbers that are read into the printer. The printer frame also\r\nstores indications, for example, the signs of numbers, plus or minus,\r\nfor purposes of combining them. These frames also hold the relays that\r\ncontrol the printer, the problem tape, and the table tapes. Jointly for\r\nboth Computers, the _position frames_ connect a problem in some problem\r\nposition to a Computer that becomes idle. For example, one problem\r\nmay finish in the middle of the night; the machine automatically and\r\nunattended switches to another problem position and proceeds with the\r\ninstructions there contained. A backlog of computing on hand can be\r\nstored in two of the problem positions, while the other two control the\r\ntwo Computers. In each Computer, the _routine frames_ hold the relays\r\nthat make the Computer follow the routine instructions. Jointly for\r\nboth Computers, the remaining frames—the _control frames_, the _BTL\r\nframes_, and the _permanent table frames_—hold the relays that control:\r\nthe alarms and lights for indicating failures; some circuits called the\r\nBTL controls; the tape processor; and the mathematical tables that are\r\npermanently wired into the machine. The permanent table frames hold the\r\nfollowing mathematical functions (see Supplement 2): _sine_, _cosine_,\r\n_antitangent_, _logarithm_, and _antilogarithm_.\r\n\r\n\r\nStoring\r\n\r\nNumbers can be stored in the machine in the 30 regular storing\r\nregisters of both Computers together. They can also be stored, at the\r\ncost of tying up some machine capacity, in the other registers: the 4\r\ncalculator registers, the 2 problem registers, the 2 table registers,\r\nand the 2 printer registers. Numbers can also be punched out on tape,\r\nin either of the two printers, and later read again from the tape.\r\nLabels identifying the numbers can also be punched and read again from\r\nthe tape.\r\n\r\nEach register in the machine stores a number in the biquinary notation,\r\nas explained above. In programming the machine, after mentioning a\r\nregister it is necessary—as a part of the scheme for checking—to tell\r\nthe machine specifically whether to hold the number in the register or\r\nto clear it.\r\n\r\n\r\nAddition and Subtraction\r\n\r\nThe calculator frames can add two numbers together, if so instructed in\r\nthe routine tape. Suppose that the two numbers are in the registers\r\n_B_ and _D_ and that we wish to put the sum in register _F_. Suppose\r\nthat we wish to clear the _D_ number but hold the _B_ number after\r\nusing them. The code on the routine tape is _B H_ + _D C_ = _F_. _H_\r\nand _C_ coming right after the names of the registers always designate\r\n“hold” and “clear,” respectively.\r\n\r\nThe calculator frames can, likewise, subtract a number. The routine\r\ninstruction _B H_-_D C_ = _F_ means:\r\n\r\n    Take the number in register _B_ (hold it); subtract the\r\n      number in _D_ (clear it); put the result in _F_\r\n\r\n\r\nMultiplication and Division\r\n\r\nThe calculator frames perform multiplication by storing the digits of\r\nthe multiplier, adding the multiplicand over and over, and shifting,\r\nuntil the product is obtained. However, if the multiplier is 1989, for\r\nexample, the calculator treats it as 2000-11. This short-cut applies\r\nto digits 6, 7, 8, 9 and cuts the time required for multiplying. The\r\nroutine instruction is _B H_ × _D C_ = _F_.\r\n\r\nThe calculator performs division by repeated subtraction. The routine\r\ninstruction is _B H_ ÷ _D C_ = _F_. The operation signs +,-, ×, ÷\r\nactually appear on the keyboard of the perforator and on the printed\r\ntape produced by the printer.\r\n\r\n\r\nDiscrimination\r\n\r\n_Discrimination_ is the term used in the Bell Laboratories computer for\r\nwhat we have previously called selection, or comparison, or sequencing.\r\nThe _discriminator_ is a part of the calculator that compares or\r\nselects or decides—“discriminates.” The discriminator can decide\r\nwhether a number is zero or not zero. In the language of the _algebra\r\nof logic_ (see Chapter 9 and Supplement 2), if _a_ is a number, the\r\ndiscriminator can find _T_(_a_ = 0). The discriminator can also decide\r\nwhether a number is positive or negative. In the language of logic, it\r\ncan find _T_(_a_ > 0) or _T_(_a_ < 0). The actions that a discriminator\r\ncan cause to be taken are:\r\n\r\n    Stop the machine.\r\n    Stop the problem, and proceed to another problem.\r\n    Stop the routine going on, and proceed with a new routine.\r\n    Permit printing, or prevent printing; etc.\r\n\r\nIn this way the discriminator can:\r\n\r\n    Distinguish between right and wrong results.\r\n    Tell that a certain result is impossible.\r\n    Recognize a certain result to be the answer.\r\n    Control the number of repetitions of a formula.\r\n    Change from one formula to another formula.\r\n    Check a number against a tolerance; etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROBLEMS\r\n\r\nAmong the problems that have been placed on the machine successfully\r\nare: solving the _differential equation_ of a _trajectory_ (see Chapter\r\n5) and solving 32 _linear simultaneous equations_ in 32 _unknowns_ (see\r\nSupplement 2). In the second case, the routine tapes were designed to\r\napply equally well to 11 to 100 linear equations in 11 to 100 unknowns.\r\nHowever, the machine can do a very broad class of problems, including,\r\nfor example, computing a personal income tax. This calculation with all\r\nits complexity of choices cannot be placed on any of the mechanical\r\nbrains described in previous chapters. The machine can, of course, be\r\nused to calculate any tables that we may wish to refer to.\r\n\r\n\r\nAN APPRAISAL OF THE CALCULATOR\r\n\r\nThe Bell Telephone Laboratories general-purpose relay computer is\r\nprobably the best mechanical brain made up to the end of 1947, in\r\nregard to the two important factors of reliability and versatility.\r\n\r\n\r\nReliability\r\n\r\nThe machine produces results that are practically 100 per cent\r\nreliable, for the machine checks each step before taking the next\r\none. The checking principle is that exactly a certain number of\r\nrelays must be energized. For example, as we said before, for each\r\ndecimal digit there are 7 relays. Exactly 2 of these relays must be\r\nenergized—no more, no less. If this does not happen, the machine stops\r\nat once without losing any numbers. Lights shine for many circuits\r\nin the control panel, and, if you compare what they ought to show\r\nwith what they do show, you can usually find at once the location of\r\nthe mistake. The trouble may be a speck of dirt between two contact\r\npoints on a relay, and, when it is brushed away, the machine can go\r\nright ahead from where it stopped. According to a statement by Franz\r\nL. Alt, director of the computing laboratory at the Ballistic Research\r\nLaboratories, in December 1947, “the Bell machine had not given a\r\nsingle wrong result in eight months of operation, except when operators\r\ninterfered with its normal running.”\r\n\r\nTo guard against the risk of putting tapes in the wrong transmitters,\r\nthe machine will check by the instructions contained in the tapes that\r\nthe right tapes are in the right places.\r\n\r\n\r\nTime Required\r\n\r\nThe time required to do problems on this mechanical brain is perhaps\r\nlonger than on the others. The numbers are handled digit by digit on\r\nthe input tapes, and the typewriter in the recorder moves space by\r\nspace in order to get to the proper writing point. These are slow\r\nprocedures. The speeds of numerical operation are: addition, ³/₁₀\r\nsecond; multiplication, 1 second on the average; division, 2.7 seconds\r\non the average; square root, 4.5 seconds on the average; logarithm,\r\nabout 15 seconds.\r\n\r\n\r\nStaff\r\n\r\nIn order to operate the machine, the staff required is: one maintenance\r\nman; one mathematical engineer; about six girls for punching tape,\r\netc., depending on the number of problems to be handled at the rate of\r\nabout one problem per week per girl. Unlike any of the other mechanical\r\nbrains built by the end of 1947, this machine will run unattended.\r\n\r\n\r\nMaintenance\r\n\r\nThe relays in the machine will operate for years with no failure; they\r\nhave the experience of standard telephone techniques built into them.\r\nUnder laboratory conditions this type of relay had by 1946 operated\r\nsuccessfully much more than 100 million times. The tape feeding and\r\nreading equipment in the machine may be maintained by periodic\r\ninspection and service. The total number of teletype transmitters in\r\nthe machine is 38. If one fails, it is easy to plug in a spare.\r\n\r\nThe total power required for the machine is about 28 horsepower.\r\nBatteries are furnished so that, if the power supply should be\r\ninterrupted, the machine can still operate for as long as a half-hour.\r\n\r\n\r\nCost\r\n\r\nThe cost of production of this machine in the size of 4 problem\r\npositions and 2 computers has been roughly estimated as half a million\r\ndollars. This cost includes material, manufacture, installation, and\r\ntesting. No development cost is included in this figure. Instead, the\r\ncost of development has been reckoned as squaring with patents and\r\nother contributions of the work to the telephone switching art.\r\n\r\nIt is unlikely that the general-purpose relay computer will be\r\nmanufactured generally. The pressure of orders for telephones, the\r\nneed to catch up with the backlog of demand, and the development of\r\nelectronic computers—all indicate that the Bell system will hardly\r\ngo further with this type of computer. In an emergency, however, the\r\nBell system would probably construct such machines for the government,\r\nif requested. In the meantime, many principles first used in the\r\ngeneral-purpose relay computer are likely to find applications in\r\ntelephone system work. In fact, a present major development being\r\npursued in the telephone sections of Bell Laboratories is the\r\napplication of the computer principles to the automatic computation of\r\ntelephone bills.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 9\r\n\r\nREASONING:\r\n\r\nTHE KALIN-BURKHART LOGICAL-TRUTH CALCULATOR\r\n\r\n\r\nSo far we have talked about mechanical brains that are mathematicians.\r\nThey are fond of numbers; their main work is with numbers; and the\r\nother kinds of thinking they do are secondary. We now come to a\r\nmechanical brain that is a logician. It is fond of reasoning—logic; its\r\nmain work is with what is logically true and what is logically false;\r\nand it does not handle numbers. This mechanical brain was finished in\r\nJune 1947. It is called the _Kalin-Burkhart Logical-Truth Calculator_.\r\nAs its name tells, it calculates _logical truth_. Now what do we mean\r\nby that?\r\n\r\n\r\nTRUTH\r\n\r\nTo be true or false is a property of a statement. Usually we say that\r\na statement is true when it expresses a fact. For example, take the\r\nstatement “Salt dissolves in water.” We consider this statement to be\r\ntrue because it expresses a fact. Actually, in this case we can roughly\r\nprove the fact ourselves. We take a bowl, put some water in it, and put\r\nin a little salt. After a while we look into the water and notice that\r\nno salt whatever is to be seen.\r\n\r\nOf course, this statement, like many another, occurs in a _context_\r\nwhere certain things are understood. One of the understandings here,\r\nfor example, is “a small amount of salt in a much larger amount of\r\nwater.” For if we put a whole bag full of salt in just a little water,\r\nnot all the salt will dissolve. Nearly every statement occurs in a\r\ncontext that we must know if we are to decide whether the statement is\r\ntrue or false.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOGICAL TRUTH\r\n\r\nLogical truth is different from ordinary truth. With logical truth\r\nwe appeal not to facts but to suppositions. Usually we say that a\r\nstatement is logically true when it follows logically from certain\r\nsuppositions. In other words, we play a game that has useful, even\r\nwonderful, results. The game starts with “if” or “suppose” or “let us\r\nassume.” While the game lasts, any statement is logically true if it\r\nfollows logically from the suppositions.\r\n\r\nFor example, let us take five statements:\r\n\r\n    1. “The earth is flat like a sheet of paper.”\r\n\r\n    2. “The earth is round like a ball.”\r\n\r\n    3. “John Doe travels as fast as he can, without turning\r\n        to left or to right, for many days.”\r\n\r\n    4. “John Doe will fall off the earth.”\r\n\r\n    5. “John Doe will arrive back at his starting point.”\r\n\r\nLet us also take a certain context in which: We know what we mean\r\nby such words as “earth,” “flat,” “falling,” etc.; we have other\r\nstatements and understandings such as “if John Doe walks off the edge\r\nof a cliff, he will fall,” “a flat sheet of paper has an edge,” etc.\r\nIn this context, if statements 1 and 3 are supposed, then statement\r\n4 is logically true. On the other hand, if statements 2 and 3 are\r\nsupposed, then statement 5 is logically true. Of course, for many\r\ncenturies, nearly all men believed statement 1; and the importance of\r\nthe years 1492 to 1521 (Columbus to Magellan) is linked with the final\r\nproof that statement 2 expresses a fact. So, depending on the game, or\r\nthe context, whichever we wish to call it, almost any statement can\r\nbe logically true. What we become interested in, therefore, is the\r\nconnections between statements which make them _follow logically_.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOGICAL PATTERNS\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most familiar example of “following logically” is a pattern\r\nof words like the following:\r\n\r\n    1. All igs are ows.\r\n    2. All ows are umphs.\r\n    3. Therefore, all igs are umphs.\r\n\r\nIf statements 1 and 2 are supposed, then statement 3 is logically true.\r\nIn other words, statement 3 logically follows from statements 1 and 2.\r\nThis word pattern is logically true, no matter what substitutions we\r\nmake for igs, ows, and umphs. For example, we can replace igs by men,\r\nows by animals, and umphs by mortals, and obtain:\r\n\r\n    4. All men are animals.\r\n    5. All animals are mortals.\r\n    6. Therefore, all men are mortals.\r\n\r\nThe invented words “igs,” “ows,” “umphs” mark places in the _logical\r\npattern_ where we can insert any names we are interested in. The words\r\n“all,” “are,” “therefore” and the ending s mark the logical pattern. Of\r\ncourse, instead of using invented words like “igs,” “ows,” “umphs” we\r\nwould usually put _A_’s, _B_’s, _C_’s. This logical pattern is called a\r\n_syllogism_ and is one of the most familiar. But there are even simpler\r\nlogical patterns that are also familiar.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SIMPLEST LOGICAL PATTERNS\r\n\r\nMany simple logical patterns are so familiar that we often use them\r\nwithout being conscious of doing so. The simple logical patterns are\r\nmarked by words like “and,” “or,” “else,” “not,” “if,” “then,” “only.”\r\nIn the same way, simple arithmetical patterns are marked by words like\r\n“plus,” “minus,” “times,” “divided by.”\r\n\r\nLet us see what some of these simple logical patterns are. Suppose that\r\nwe take two statements about which we have no factual information that\r\nmight interfere with logical supposing:\r\n\r\n1. John Doe is eligible for insurance.\r\n\r\n2. John Doe requires a medical examination.\r\n\r\nIn practice, we might be concerned with such statements when writing\r\nthe rules governing a plan of insurance for a group of employees. Here,\r\nwe shall play a game:\r\n\r\n    (1) We shall make up some new statements from\r\n        statements 1 and 2, using the words “and,”\r\n         “or,” “else,” “not,” “if,” “then,” “only.”\r\n\r\n    (2) We shall examine the logical patterns that we can make.\r\n\r\n    (3) We shall see what we can find out about their\r\n        logical truth.\r\n\r\nSuppose we make up the following statements:\r\n\r\n    3. John Doe is not eligible for insurance.\r\n\r\n    4. John Doe does not require a medical examination.\r\n\r\n    5. John Doe is eligible for insurance and requires a medical\r\n       examination.\r\n\r\n    6. John Doe is eligible for insurance, and John Doe is eligible\r\n       for insurance.\r\n\r\n    7. John Doe is eligible for insurance, or John Doe requires\r\n       a medical examination.\r\n\r\n    8. If John Doe is eligible for insurance, then he requires\r\n       a medical examination.\r\n\r\n    9. John Doe requires a medical examination if and only if\r\n       he is eligible for insurance.\r\n\r\n    10. John Doe is eligible for insurance or else he requires\r\n        a medical examination.\r\n\r\nNow clearly it is troublesome to repeat quantities of words when we\r\nare interested only in the way that “and,” “or,” “else,” “not,” “if,”\r\n“then,” “only” occur. So, let us use just 1 and 2 for the two original\r\nstatements, remembering that “1 AND 2” means here “statement 1 AND\r\nstatement 2” and does not mean 1 plus 2. Then we have:\r\n\r\n     3: NOT-1\r\n     4: NOT-2\r\n     5: 1 AND 2\r\n     6: 1 AND 1\r\n     7: 1 OR 2\r\n     8: IF 1, THEN 2\r\n     9: 1 IF AND ONLY IF 2\r\n    10: 1 OR ELSE 2\r\n\r\nHere then are some simple logical patterns that we can make.\r\n\r\n\r\nCALCULATION OF LOGICAL TRUTH\r\n\r\nNow what can we find out about the logical truth of statements 3 to\r\n10? If we know something about the truth or falsity of statements\r\n1 and 2, what will logically follow about the truth or falsity of\r\nstatements 3 to 10? In other words, how can we calculate the logical\r\ntruth of statements 3 to 10, given the truth or falsity of statements 1\r\nand 2?\r\n\r\nFor example, 3 is NOT-1; that is, statement 3 is the negative or the\r\n_denial_ of statement 1. It follows logically that, if 1 is true, 3 is\r\nfalse; if 1 is false, 3 is true. Suppose that we use _T_ for logically\r\ntrue and _F_ for logically false. Then we can show our calculation of\r\nthe logical truth of statement 3 in Table 1.\r\n\r\n       Table 1         Table 2\r\n\r\n     1  | NOT-1 = 3    2  | NOT-2 = 4\r\n        |                 |\r\n    _T_ |    _F_      _T_ |    _F_\r\n    _F_ |    _T_      _F_ |    _T_\r\n\r\nOur rule for calculation is: For _T_ put _F_; for _F_ put _T_. Of\r\ncourse, exactly the same rule applies to statements 2 and 4 (see Table\r\n2). The _T_ and _F_ are called _truth values_. Any meaningful statement\r\ncan have truth values. This type of table is called a _truth table_.\r\nFor any logical pattern, we can make up a truth table.\r\n\r\nLet us take another example, “AND.” Statement 5 is the same as\r\nstatement 1 AND statement 2. How can we calculate the logical truth of\r\nstatement 5? We can make up the same sort of a table as before. On the\r\nleft-hand side of this table, there will be 4 cases:\r\n\r\n    1. Statement 1 true, statement 2 true.\r\n    2. Statement 1 false, statement 2 true.\r\n    3. Statement 1 true, statement 2 false.\r\n    4. Statement 1 false, statement 2 false.\r\n\r\nOn the right-hand side of this table, we shall put down the truth\r\nvalue of statement 5. Statement 5 is true if both statements 1 and\r\n2 are true; statement 5 is false in the other cases. We know this\r\nfrom our common everyday experience with the meaning of “AND” between\r\nstatements. So we can set up the truth table, and our rule for\r\ncalculation of logical truth, in the case of AND, is shown on Table 3.\r\n\r\n          Table 3\r\n\r\n     1   2  | 1 AND 2 = 5\r\n            |\r\n    _T_ _T_ |     _T_\r\n    _F_ _T_ |     _F_\r\n    _T_ _F_ |     _F_\r\n    _F_ _F_ |     _F_\r\n\r\n“AND” and the other words and phrases joining together the original two\r\nstatements to make new statements are called _connectives_, or _logical\r\nconnectives_. The connectives that we have illustrated in statements 7\r\nto 10 are: OR, IF ··· THEN, IF AND ONLY IF, OR ELSE.\r\n\r\nTable 4 shows the truth table that applies to statements 7, 8, 9, and\r\n10. This truth table expresses the calculation of the logical truth or\r\nfalsity of these statements.\r\n\r\n                            Table 4\r\n\r\n                                     1 IF AND\r\n             1 OR 2   IF 1, THEN 2   ONLY IF 2   1 OR ELSE 2\r\n     1   2  |  = 7         = 8           = 9         = 10\r\n            |\r\n    _T_ _T_ |  _T_         _T_           _T_          _F_\r\n    _F_ _T_ |  _T_         _T_           _F_          _T_\r\n    _T_ _F_ |  _T_         _F_           _F_          _T_\r\n    _F_ _F_ |  _F_         _T_           _T_          _F_\r\n\r\nThe “OR” (as in statement 7) that is defined in the truth table is\r\noften called the _inclusive “or”_ and means “AND/OR.” Statement 7,\r\n“1 OR 2,” is considered to be the same as “1 OR 2 OR BOTH.” There is\r\nanother “OR” in common use, often called the _exclusive “or,”_ meaning\r\n“OR ELSE” (as in statement 10). Statement 10, “1 OR ELSE 2,” is the\r\nsame as “1 OR 2 BUT NOT BOTH” or “EITHER 1 OR 2.” In ordinary English,\r\nthere is some confusion over these two “OR’s.” Usually we rely on\r\nthe context to tell which one is intended. Of course, such reliance\r\nis not safe. Sometimes we rely on a necessary conflict between the\r\ntwo statements connected by “OR” which prevents the “both” case from\r\nbeing possible. In Latin the two kinds of “OR” were distinguished by\r\ndifferent words, _vel_ meaning “AND/OR,” and _aut_ meaning “OR ELSE.”\r\n\r\nThe “IF ··· THEN” that is defined in the truth table agrees with our\r\nusual understanding that (1) when the “IF clause” is true, the “THEN\r\nclause” must be true; and (2) when the “IF clause” is false, the “THEN\r\nclause” may be either true or false. The “IF AND ONLY IF” that is\r\ndefined in the truth table agrees with our usual understanding that (1)\r\nif either clause is true, the other is true; and (2) if either clause\r\nis false, the other is false.\r\n\r\nIn statement 6, there are only two possible cases, and the truth table\r\nis shown in Table 5.\r\n\r\n        Table 5\r\n\r\n     1  | 1 AND 1 = 6\r\n        |\r\n    _T_ |      _T_\r\n    _F_ |      _F_\r\n\r\nWe know that 6 is true if and only if 1 is true. In other words, the\r\nstatement “1 AND 1 IF AND ONLY IF 1” is true, no matter what statement\r\n1 may refer to. It is because of this fact that we never use a\r\nstatement in the form “1 and 1”: it can always be replaced by the plain\r\nstatement “1.”\r\n\r\n\r\nLOGICAL-TRUTH CALCULATION BY EXAMINING CASES AND REASONING\r\n\r\nNow you may say that this is all very well, but what good is it? Almost\r\nanybody can use these connectives correctly and certainly has had a\r\ngreat deal of practice using them. Why do we need to go into truth\r\nvalues and truth tables?\r\n\r\nWhen we draft a contract or a set of rules, we often have to consider\r\nseveral conditions that give rise to a number of cases. We must avoid:\r\n\r\n    1. All _conflicts_, in which two statements that disagree\r\n       apply to the same case.\r\n\r\n    2. All _loopholes_, in which there is a case not covered\r\n       by any statement.\r\n\r\nIf we have one statement or condition only, we have to consider 2\r\npossible cases: the condition satisfied or the statement true;\r\nthe condition not satisfied or the statement false. If we have 2\r\nconditions, we have to consider 4 possible cases: true, true; false,\r\ntrue; true, false; false, false. If we have 3 conditions, we have to\r\nconsider 8 possible cases one after the other (see Table 6).\r\n\r\n\r\nTable 6\r\n\r\n    CASE   1ST CONDITION   2ND CONDITION   3RD CONDITION\r\n\r\n     1          _T_             _T_             _T_\r\n     2          _F_             _T_             _T_\r\n     3          _T_             _F_             _T_\r\n     4          _F_             _F_             _T_\r\n\r\n     5          _T_             _T_             _F_\r\n     6          _F_             _T_             _F_\r\n     7          _T_             _F_             _F_\r\n     8          _F_             _F_             _F_\r\n\r\nInstead of _T_’s and _F_’s, we would ordinarily use _check-marks_ (✓)\r\nand _crosses_ (✕), which, of course, have the same meaning. We may\r\nconsider and study each case individually. In any event, we must make\r\nsure that the proposed contract or set of rules covers all the cases\r\nwithout conflicts or loopholes.\r\n\r\nThe number of possible cases that we have to consider doubles whenever\r\none more condition is added. Clearly, it soon becomes too much work\r\nto consider each case individually, and so we must turn to a second\r\nmethod, thoughtful classifying and reasoning about classes of cases.\r\n\r\nNow suppose that the number of conditions increases: 4 conditions give\r\nrise to 16 possible cases; 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, ··· conditions give rise\r\nto 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, ··· cases respectively. Because of the\r\nlarge number of cases, we soon begin to make mistakes while reasoning\r\nabout classes of cases. We need a more efficient way of knowing whether\r\nall cases are covered properly.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOGICAL-TRUTH CALCULATION BY ALGEBRA\r\n\r\nOne of the more efficient ways of reasoning is often called the\r\n_algebra of logic_. This algebra is a part of a new science called\r\n_mathematical logic_. Mathematical logic is a science that has the\r\nfollowing characteristics:\r\n\r\n    It studies chiefly nonnumerical reasoning.\r\n\r\n    It seeks accurate meanings and necessary consequences.\r\n\r\n    Its chief instruments are efficient symbols.\r\n\r\nMathematical logic studies especially the logical relations expressed\r\nin such words as “or,” “and,” “not,” “else,” “if,” “then,” “only,”\r\n“the,” “of,” “is,” “every,” “all,” “none,” “some,” “same,” “different,”\r\netc. The algebra of logic studies especially only the first seven of\r\nthese words.\r\n\r\nThe great thinkers of ancient Greece first studied the problems\r\nof logical reasoning as these problems turned up in philosophy,\r\npsychology, and debate. Aristotle originated what was called _formal\r\nlogic_. This was devoted mainly to variations of the logical pattern\r\nshown above called the syllogism. In the last 150 years, the fine\r\nsymbolic techniques developed by mathematicians were applied to\r\nthe problems of the calculation of logical truth, and the result\r\nwas mathematical logic, much broader and much more powerful than\r\nformal logic. A milestone in the development of mathematical logic\r\nwas _The Laws of Thought_, written by George Boole, a great English\r\nmathematician, and published in 1854. Boole introduced the branch of\r\nmathematical logic called the algebra of logic, also called _Boolean\r\nalgebra_. In late years, all the branches of mathematical logic have\r\nbeen improved and made easier to use.\r\n\r\nWe can give a simple numerical example of Boolean algebra and how it\r\ncan calculate logical truth. Suppose that we take the truth value of a\r\nstatement as 1 if it is true and 0 if it is false. Now we have numbers\r\n1 and 0 instead of letters _T_ and _F_. Since they are numbers, we can\r\nadd them, subtract them, and multiply them. We can also make up simple\r\nnumerical formulas that will let us calculate logical truth. If _P_\r\nand _Q_ are statements, and if _p_ and _q_ are their truth values,\r\nrespectively, we have Table 7.\r\n\r\n\r\nTable 7\r\n\r\n        STATEMENT             TRUTH VALUE\r\n    NOT-_P_                   1 - _p_\r\n    _P_ AND _Q_               _pq_\r\n    _P_ OR _Q_                _p_ + _q_ - _pq_\r\n    IF _P_, THEN _Q_          1 - _p_ + _pq_\r\n    _P_ IF AND ONLY IF _Q_    1 - _p_ - _q_ + 2_pq_\r\n    _P_ OR ELSE _Q_           _p_ + _q_ - 2_pq_\r\n\r\nFor example, suppose that we have two statements _P_ and _Q_:\r\n\r\n    _P_: John Doe is eligible for insurance.\r\n\r\n    _Q_: John Doe requires a medical examination.\r\n\r\nTo test that the truth value of “_P_ OR _Q_” is _p_ + _q_-_pq_, let us\r\nput down the four cases, and calculate the result (see Table 8).\r\n\r\n\r\nTable 8\r\n\r\n    _p_ _q_ | _p_ + _q_ - _pq_\r\n                      |\r\n     1   1  | 1 + 1 - 1 = 1\r\n     0   1  | 0 + 1 - 0 = 1\r\n     1   0  | 1 + 0 - 0 = 1\r\n     0   0  | 0 + 0 - 0 = 0\r\n\r\nNow we know that _P_ or _Q_ is true if and only if either one or both\r\nof _P_ and _Q_ are true, and thus we see that the calculation is\r\ncorrect.\r\n\r\nThe algebra of logic (see also Supplement 2) is a more efficient way of\r\ncalculating logical truth. But it is still a good deal of work to use\r\nthe algebra. For example, if we have 10 conditions, we shall have 10\r\nletters like _p_, _q_ to handle in calculations. Thus we need a still\r\nmore efficient way.\r\n\r\n\r\nCALCULATION OF CIRCUITS BY THE ALGEBRA OF LOGIC\r\n\r\nIn 1937 a research assistant at Massachusetts Institute of Technology,\r\nClaude E. Shannon, was studying for his degree of master of science.\r\nHe was enrolled in the Department of Electrical Engineering. He was\r\ninterested in automatic switching circuits and wondered why an algebra\r\nshould not apply to them. He wrote his thesis on the answer to this\r\nquestion and showed that:\r\n\r\n    (1) There is an algebra that applies to switching circuits.\r\n\r\n    (2) It is the algebra of logic.\r\n\r\nA paper, based on his thesis, was published in 1938 in the\r\n_Transactions of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers_ with\r\nthe title “A Symbolic Analysis of Relay and Switching Circuits.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1. Switches in series.]\r\n\r\nFor a simple example of what Shannon found out, suppose that we have\r\ntwo switches, 1, 2, in series (see Fig. 1). When do we get current\r\nflowing from the source to the sink? There are 4 possible cases and\r\nresults (see Table 9).\r\n\r\n\r\nTable 9\r\n\r\n    SWITCH 1 IS CLOSED   SWITCH 2 IS CLOSED   CURRENT FLOWS\r\n           Yes                  Yes                Yes\r\n           No                   Yes                No\r\n           Yes                  No                 No\r\n           No                   No                 No\r\n\r\nNow what does this table remind us of? It is precisely the truth table\r\nfor “AND.” It is just what we would have if we wrote down the truth\r\ntable of the statement “Switch 1 is closed AND switch 2 is closed.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2. Switches in parallel.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3. Switch open—current flowing.]\r\n\r\nSuppose that we have two switches 1, 2 in parallel (see Fig. 2). When\r\ndo we get current flowing from the source to the sink? Answer: when\r\neither one or both of the switches are closed. Therefore, this circuit\r\nis an exact representation of the statement “Switch 1 is closed or\r\nswitch 2 is closed.”\r\n\r\nSuppose that we have a switch that has two positions, and at any time\r\nmust be at one and only one of these two positions (see Fig. 3).\r\nSuppose that current flows only when the switch is open. There are two\r\npossible cases and results (see Table 10).\r\n\r\n\r\nTable 10\r\n\r\n    SWITCH 1 IS CLOSED   CURRENT FLOWS\r\n\r\n           Yes                No\r\n           No                 Yes\r\n\r\nThis is like the truth table for “NOT”; and this circuit is an exact\r\nrepresentation of the statement “Switch 1 is NOT closed.” (_Note_:\r\nThese examples are in substantial agreement with Shannon’s paper,\r\nalthough Shannon uses different conventions.)\r\n\r\nWe see, therefore, that there is a very neat correspondence between the\r\nalgebra of logic and automatic switching circuits. Thus it happens that:\r\n\r\n    1. The algebra of logic can be used in the calculation of\r\n       some electrical circuits.\r\n\r\n    2. Some electrical circuits can be used in the calculations\r\n       of the algebra of logic.\r\n\r\nThis fact is what led to the next step.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOGICAL-TRUTH CALCULATION BY MACHINE\r\n\r\nIn 1946 two undergraduates at Harvard University, Theodore A. Kalin\r\nand William Burkhart, were taking a course in mathematical logic.\r\nThey noticed that there were a large number of truth tables to be\r\nworked out. To work them out took time and effort and yet was a rather\r\ntiresome automatic process not requiring much thinking. They had had\r\nsome experience with electrical circuits. Knowing of Shannon’s work,\r\nthey said to each other, “Why not build an electrical machine to\r\ncalculate truth tables?”\r\n\r\nThey took about two months to decide on the essential design of the\r\nmachine:\r\n\r\n    1. The machine would have dial switches in which logical\r\n       connectives would be entered.\r\n\r\n    2. It would have dial switches in which the numbers of\r\n       statements like 1, 2, 3 ··· would be entered.\r\n\r\n    3. It would scan the proper truth table line by line by\r\n       sending electrical pulses through the dial switches.\r\n\r\n    4. It would compute the truth or falsehood of the whole\r\n       expression.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONSTRUCTION AND COMPLETION OF THE KALIN-BURKHART LOGICAL-TRUTH\r\nCALCULATOR\r\n\r\nWith the designs in mind, Kalin and Burkhart bought some war surplus\r\nmaterials, including relays, switches, wires, lights, and a metal\r\nbox about 30 inches long by 16 inches tall, and 13 inches deep. From\r\nMarch to June, 1947, they constructed a machine in their spare time,\r\nassembling and mounting the parts inside the box. The total cost of\r\nmaterials was about $150. In June the machine was demonstrated in\r\nCambridge, Mass., before several logicians and engineers, and in August\r\nit was moved for some months to the office of a life insurance company.\r\nThere some study was made of the possible application of the machine in\r\ndrafting contracts and rules.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL ORGANIZATION OF THE MACHINE\r\n\r\nThe logical-truth calculator built by Kalin and Burkhart is not giant\r\nin size, although giant in capacity. Like other mechanical brains,\r\nthe machine is made up of many pieces of a rather small number of\r\ndifferent kinds of parts. The machine contains about 45 dial switches,\r\n23 snap switches (or two-position switches), 85 relays, 6 push buttons,\r\nless than a mile of wire, etc. The lid of the metal box is the front,\r\nvertical panel of the machine.\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITS OF THE MACHINE\r\n\r\nThe machine contains 16 units. These units are listed in Table 11, in\r\napproximately the order in which they appear on the front panel of the\r\nmachine—row by row from top to bottom, and from left to right in each\r\nrow.\r\n\r\n\r\nTable 11\r\n\r\nUNITS, THEIR NAMES, AND SIGNIFICANCE\r\n\r\n    UNIT ROW   PART       NO.

The symbols used for these connectives\r\nin mathematical logic are ∧, ∨, ▲, ▼. These signs serve as labels\r\nfor the connective switch points. In this machine, when there is a\r\nconnective between two statements, the statement that comes before is\r\ncalled the _antecedent_ and the statement that comes after is called\r\nthe _consequent_.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW INFORMATION GOES INTO THE MACHINE\r\n\r\nOf the 16 units 13 are input units. They control the setup of the\r\nmachine so that it can solve a problem. Of the 13 input units, those\r\nthat have the most to do with taking in the problem are shown in Table\r\n12.\r\n\r\n\r\nTable 12\r\n\r\n          Name of                               KIND OF\r\n    UNIT  SWITCHES   MARK   SWITCH          SWITCH SETTINGS\r\n\r\n     3   Statement  _V_₁ to  Dial    Statements 1 to 12 or constant\r\n                     _V_₁₂                 _T_ or _F_\r\n     2   Statement     ~     Snap     Affirmative (down) or negative\r\n           denial                               (up)\r\n     4   Connective _k_₁ to  Dial    ∧ (AND),\r\n                     _k_₁₁           ∨ (OR),\r\n                                      ▲ (IF-THEN),\r\n                                      ▼ (IF AND ONLY IF)\r\n     8   Connective      ~   Snap     Affirmative (down) or negative\r\n           denial                              (up)\r\n     5   Antecedent _A_₁ to  Dial     _V_ or various _k_’s\r\n                     _A_₁₁\r\n     6   Consequent _C_₁ to  Dial     _V_ or various _k_’s\r\n                     _C_₁₁\r\n     7   Stop       _S_₁ to  Snap     Not connected (down) or\r\n                     _S_₁₁               connected (up)\r\n\r\nThe first step in putting a problem on the machine is to express the\r\nwhole problem as a single compound statement that we want to know the\r\ntruth or falsity of. We express the single compound statement in a form\r\nsuch as the following:\r\n\r\n    _V k V k V k V k V k V k V k V k V k V k V k V_\r\n\r\nwhere each _V_ represents a statement, each _k_ represents a\r\nconnective, and we know the grouping, or in other words, we know the\r\nantecedent and consequent of each connective.\r\n\r\nFor example, let us choose a problem with an obvious answer:\r\n\r\n    PROBLEM. Given: statement 1 is true; and if statement 1 is true,\r\n    then statement 2 is true; and if statement 2 is true, then statement\r\n    3 is true; and if statement 3 is true, then statement 4 is true.\r\n    Is statement 4 true?\r\n\r\nHow do we express this whole problem in a form that will go on the\r\nmachine? We express the whole problem as a single compound statement\r\nthat we want to know the truth or falsity of:\r\n\r\nIf [1 and (if 1 then 2) and (if 2 then 3) and (if 3 then 4)], then 4\r\n\r\nThe 8 statements occurring in this problem are, respectively: 1 1 2 2\r\n3 3 4 4. These are the values at which the _V_ switches (the statement\r\ndial switches, Unit 2) from _V_₁ to _V_₈ are set. The 7 connectives\r\noccurring in this problem are, respectively: AND, IF-THEN, AND,\r\nIF-THEN, AND, IF-THEN, IF-THEN. These are the values at which the _k_\r\nswitches (the connective dial switches, Unit 4) from _k_₁ to _k_₇ are\r\nset.\r\n\r\nA grouping (one of several possible groupings) that specifies the\r\nantecedent and consequent of each connective is the following:\r\n\r\n    1 AND 1 IF-THEN 2 AND 2 IF-THEN 3 AND 3 IF-THEN 4 IF-THEN 4\r\n          |         |     |         |     |         |\r\n          +—————————+     +—————————+     +—————————+\r\n             _k_₂            _k_₄            _k_₆\r\n    |               |     |                         |\r\n    +———————————————+     +—————————————————————————+\r\n     _k_₁                            _k_₅\r\n    |                                               |\r\n    +———————————————————————————————————————————————+\r\n                     _k_₃\r\n    |                                                         |\r\n    +—————————————————————————————————————————————————————————+\r\n                                                        _k_₇\r\n\r\nThe grouping has here been expressed graphically with lines but may be\r\nexpressed in the normal mathematical way with parentheses and brackets\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n    {[1 AND (1 IF-THEN 2)] AND [(2 IF-THEN 3) AND\r\n       (3 IF-THEN 4)]} IF-THEN 4.\r\n\r\nSo the values at which the antecedent and consequent dial switches are\r\nset are as shown in Table 13.\r\n\r\n\r\nTable 13\r\n\r\n                ANTECEDENT          CONSEQUENT\r\n    CONNECTIVE    SWITCH    SET AT    SWITCH     SET AT\r\n       _k_₁        _A_₁       _V_      _C_₁        _k_₂\r\n       _k_₂        _A_₂       _V_      _C_₂        _V_\r\n       _k_₃        _A_₃       _k_₁     _C_₃        _k_₅\r\n       _k_₄        _A_₄       _V_      _C_₄        _V_\r\n       _k_₅        _A_₅       _k_₄     _C_₅        _k_₆\r\n       _k_₆        _A_₆       _V_      _C_₆        _V_\r\n       _k_₇        _A_₇       _k_₃     _C_₇        _V_\r\n\r\nIn any problem, statements that are different are numbered one after\r\nanother 1, 2, 3, 4 ···. A statement that is repeated bears always the\r\nsame number. In nearly all cases that are interesting, there will be\r\nrepetitions of the statements. If any statement appeared with a “NOT”\r\nin it, we would turn up the denial switch for that statement (Unit 2).\r\n\r\nThe different connectives available on the machine are “AND,” “OR,” “IF\r\n··· THEN,” “IF AND ONLY IF.” If a “NOT” affected the compound statement\r\nproduced by any connective, we would turn up the denial switch for that\r\nconnective (Unit 8).\r\n\r\nThe last step in putting the problem on the machine is to connect the\r\nmain connective of the whole compound statement to the yellow light\r\noutput (Unit 12). In this problem the last “IF-THEN,” _k_₇, is the\r\nmain connective, the one that produces the whole compound statement.\r\nSo we turn Stop Switch 7 (in Unit 7) that belongs to _k_₇ into the\r\nup position. There are a few more things to do, naturally, but the\r\nessential part of putting the information of the problem into the\r\nmachine has now been described.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW INFORMATION COMES OUT OF THE MACHINE\r\n\r\nOf the 16 units listed in Table 11, 3 are output units, and only 2 of\r\nthese are really important, as shown in Table 14.\r\n\r\n\r\nTable 14\r\n\r\n    UNIT       NAME OF LIGHT          MARK       KIND OF LIGHT\r\n      1     Statement truth value  _V_₁ to _V_₁₂   Small, red\r\n     13     Main truth value                       Large, yellow\r\n\r\nThe answer to a problem is shown by a pattern of the lights of Units\r\n1 and 13. The pattern of lights is equivalent to a row of the truth\r\ntable. Each little red light (Unit 1) glows when its statement is\r\nassumed to be true, and it is dark when its statement is assumed to\r\nbe false. The yellow light (Unit 13) glows when the whole compound\r\nstatement is calculated to be logically true, and it is dark when the\r\nwhole compound statement is calculated to be logically false.\r\n\r\nThe machine turns its “attention” automatically to each line of the\r\ntruth table one after the other, and pulses are fed in according to the\r\npattern of assumed true statements. We can set the machine to stop on\r\ntrue cases or on false cases or on every case, so as to give us time\r\nto copy down whichever kind of results we are interested in. When we\r\nhave noted the case, we can press a button and the machine will then go\r\nahead searching for more cases.\r\n\r\n\r\nA COMPLETE AND CONCRETE EXAMPLE\r\n\r\nThe reader may still be wondering when he will see a complete and\r\nconcrete example of the application of the logical-truth calculator. So\r\nfar we have given only pieces of examples in order to illustrate some\r\nexplanation. Therefore, let us consider now the following problem:\r\n\r\n    PROBLEM. The A. A. Adams Co., Inc., has about\r\n    1000 employees. About 600 of them are insured under a\r\n    contract for group insurance with the I. I. Insurance\r\n    Co. Mr. Adams decides that more of his employees ought\r\n    to be insured. As a part of his study of the change, he\r\n    asks his manager in charge of the group insurance plan,\r\n    “What are the possible statuses of my employees who are\r\n    not insured?”\r\n\r\n    The manager replies, “I can tell you the names of the\r\n    men who are not insured, and all the data you may want\r\n    to know about them.”\r\n\r\n    Mr. Adams says, “No, John, that won’t be enough, for I\r\n    need to know whether there are any groups or classes\r\n    that for some basic reason I should exclude from the\r\n    change I am considering.”\r\n\r\n    So the manager goes to work with the following 5 statuses and\r\n    the following 5 rules, and he produces the following answer.\r\n    Our question is, “Is he right, or has he made a mistake?”\r\n\r\n    _Statuses._ A status for any employee is a report about\r\n    that employee, answering all the following 5 questions with\r\n    “yes” or “no.”\r\n\r\n    1. Is the employee eligible for insurance?\r\n\r\n    2. Has the employee applied for insurance?\r\n\r\n    3. Has the employee’s application for insurance been approved?\r\n\r\n    4. Does the employee require a medical examination for insurance?\r\n\r\n    5. Is the employee insured?\r\n\r\n_Rules._ The rules applying to employees are:\r\n\r\n    _A._ Any employee, to be insured, must be eligible\r\n      for insurance, must make application for insurance,\r\n      and must have such application for insurance approved.\r\n\r\n    _B._ Only eligible employees may apply for\r\n      insurance.\r\n\r\n    _C._ The application of any person eligible\r\n      for insurance without medical examination is\r\n      automatically approved.\r\n\r\n    _D._ (Naturally) an application can be approved\r\n      only if the application is made.\r\n\r\n    _E._ (Naturally) a medical examination will not be\r\n      required from any person not eligible for insurance.\r\n\r\n    _Answer by the Manager._ There are 5 possible\r\n      combinations of statuses for employees who are not\r\n      insured, as shown in Table 15.\r\n\r\n\r\nTable 15\r\n\r\n\r\n     POSSIBLE                         STATUS 3,   STATUS 4,\r\n    COMBINATION  STATUS 1, STATUS 2, APPLICATION EXAMINATION  STATUS 5,\r\n    OF STATUSES  ELIGIBLE   APPLIED   APPROVED    REQUIRED     INSURED\r\n\r\n          1        Yes       Yes        Yes          Yes         No\r\n          2        Yes       Yes        Yes          No          No\r\n          3        Yes       Yes        No           Yes         No\r\n          4        Yes       No         Yes          No          No\r\n          5        No        No         No           No          No\r\n\r\nThe question may be asked why employees who are eligible, who have\r\napplied for insurance, who have had their applications approved, and\r\nwho require no medical examination (combination 2) are yet not insured.\r\nThe answer is that the rules given do not logically lead to this\r\nconclusion. As a matter of fact, there might be additional rules, such\r\nas: any sick employee must first return to work; or any period from\r\ndate of approval of application to the first of the following month\r\nmust first pass.\r\n\r\nThe first step in putting this problem on the Kalin-Burkhart\r\nLogical-Truth Calculator is to rephrase the rules, using the language\r\nof the connectives that we have on the machine. The rules rephrased are:\r\n\r\n    _A._ If an employee is insured, then he is\r\n      eligible, he has applied for insurance, and his\r\n      application has been approved.\r\n\r\n    IF 5, THEN 1 AND 2\r\n      AND 3\r\n\r\n    _B._ If an employee has applied (under these\r\n      rules) for insurance, then he is eligible.\r\n\r\n    IF 2, THEN 1\r\n\r\n    _C._ If an employee is eligible for insurance, has\r\n      applied, and requires no medical examination, his\r\n      application is automatically approved.\r\n\r\n    IF 1 AND 2 AND\r\n      NOT-4, THEN 3\r\n\r\n    _D._ If an employee’s application has been\r\n      approved, then he has applied.\r\n\r\n    IF 3, THEN 2\r\n\r\n    _E._ If an employee is not eligible, then he does\r\n      not require a medical examination (under these rules).\r\n\r\n    IF NOT-1, THEN NOT-4\r\n\r\nTo get the answer we seek, we must add one more rule _for this answer\r\nonly_:\r\n\r\n    _F._ The employee is not insured.\r\n          NOT-5\r\n\r\nWe now have a total of 4 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 2 + 1 occurrences of statements,\r\nor 15 occurrences. This is beyond the capacity of the existing machine.\r\nBut fortunately Rule _F_ and Rule _A_ cancel each other; they may both\r\nbe omitted; and this gives us 10 occurrences instead of 15. In other\r\nwords, all the possible statuses under “Rule _B_ AND Rule _C_ AND Rule\r\n_D_ AND Rule _E_” will give us the answer we seek.\r\n\r\nThe rephrasing and reasoning we have done here is perhaps not easy. For\r\nexample, going from the logical pattern\r\n\r\nOnly igs may be ows to the logical pattern\r\n\r\n    If it is an ow, then it is an ig\r\n\r\nas we did in rephrasing Rule _B_, deserves rather more thought and\r\ndiscussion than we can give to the subject here. A person who is\r\nresponsible for preparing problems for the Logical-Truth Calculator\r\nshould know the algebra of logic.\r\n\r\nChoosing an appropriate grouping, we now set on the machine:\r\n\r\n    {(IF 2, THEN 1) AND [IF (1 AND 2) AND NOT-4, THEN 3]} AND\r\n    [(IF 3, THEN 2) AND (IF NOT-1, THEN NOT-4)]\r\n\r\nThe setting is as shown in Table 16. After this setting, the machine is\r\nturned on and set to stop on the “true” cases.

Thus, when we compare the manager’s result with the machine\r\nresult, we find an additional possible combination to be reported to\r\nMr. Adams, combination 7:\r\n\r\n    Employee eligible, employee has not applied, employee’s\r\n      application not approved, employee requires a medical\r\n      examination, employee not insured.\r\n\r\n\r\nTable 17\r\n\r\nSOLUTION OF THE PROBLEM BY THE CALCULATOR\r\n\r\n      LEGEND:\r\n      {A} THE EMPLOYEE IS ELIGIBLE FOR INSURANCE\r\n      {B} THE EMPLOYEE HAS APPLIED FOR INSURANCE\r\n      {C} THE EMPLOYEE’S APPLICATION FOR INSURANCE HAS BEEN APPROVED\r\n      {D} THE EMPLOYEE REQUIRES A MEDICAL EXAMINATION\r\n      {E} THE EMPLOYEE IS INSURED\r\n      {F} CASE, OR COMBINATION NO.\r\n      {G} THE COMBINATION DOES NOT CONTRADICT THE RULES,\r\n             I.E., THE YELLOW LIGHT IS ON\r\n\r\n             {A}   {B}   {C}   {D}   {E}   {F}   {G}\r\n    _Status_: 1     2     3     4     5\r\n             _T_   _T_   _T_   _T_   _F_    1    _T_\r\n             _F_   _T_   _T_   _T_   _F_    2    _F_\r\n             _T_   _F_   _T_   _T_   _F_    3    _F_\r\n             _F_   _F_   _T_   _T_   _F_    4    _F_\r\n\r\n             _T_   _T_   _F_   _T_   _F_    5    _T_\r\n             _F_   _T_   _F_   _T_   _F_    6    _F_\r\n             _T_   _F_   _F_   _T_   _F_    7    _T_\r\n             _F_   _F_   _F_   _T_   _F_    8    _F_\r\n\r\n             _T_   _T_   _T_   _F_   _F_    9    _T_\r\n             _F_   _T_   _T_   _F_   _F_   10    _F_\r\n             _T_   _F_   _T_   _F_   _F_   11    _F_\r\n             _F_   _F_   _T_   _F_   _F_   12    _F_\r\n\r\n             _T_   _T_   _F_   _F_   _F_   13    _F_\r\n             _F_   _T_   _F_   _F_   _F_   14    _F_\r\n             _T_   _F_   _F_   _F_   _F_   15    _T_\r\n             _F_   _F_   _F_   _F_   _F_   16    _T_\r\n\r\nBecause of the medical examination, this additional class of employee\r\nwould need to be considered rather carefully in any change of the group\r\ninsurance plan.\r\n\r\n\r\nAN APPRAISAL OF THE CALCULATOR\r\n\r\nIn appraising the Kalin-Burkhart Logical-Truth Calculator, we must\r\nremember that this is a first model. It was the only machine of its\r\nkind up to the end of 1948; and it worked.\r\n\r\nThe cost of the machine, as stated before, was about $150 of parts and\r\nperhaps $1000 of labor. This is less than ¹/₁₀₀ of the cost of the\r\nother giant brains described in previous chapters. Yet we can properly\r\ncall this machine a mechanical brain because it transfers information\r\nautomatically from one part to another of the machine, has automatic\r\ncontrol over the sequence of operations, and does certain kinds of\r\nreasoning.\r\n\r\nThe machine is swift. It can check up to a 100 cases against a set of\r\nrules in less than 1 minute. It can check: 128 cases for 7 conditions\r\nin 1¼ minutes, 256 cases for 8 conditions in 2½ minutes, and 4096 cases\r\nfor 12 conditions in 38 minutes. That is the limit of the present\r\nmachine. Of course, setting up the machine to do a problem takes some\r\nmore time.\r\n\r\nThe programming of this machine to do a problem is less complicated\r\nthan the programming of most of the big machines previously described.\r\nOf course, in order to prepare a problem for the machine, the preparer\r\nneeds to know a fair amount of the algebra of logic. This, however, is\r\nnot very hard. As to reliability, the machine has in practice been out\r\nof order less than 2 per cent of operating time.\r\n\r\nThe big barrier to wide use of the machine, of course, is lack of\r\nunderstanding of the field of problems in which it can be applied.\r\nEven in this modern world of ours, we are in rather a primitive stage\r\nin regard to recognizing problems in logical truth and knowing how to\r\ncalculate it. Here, however, is an electrical instrument for logical\r\nreasoning, and it seems likely that its applications will multiply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 10\r\n\r\nAN EXCURSION:\r\n\r\nTHE FUTURE DESIGN OF MACHINES THAT THINK\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the previous chapters we have described four giant mechanical\r\nbrains finished by the end of 1946: Massachusetts Institute of\r\nTechnology’s Differential Analyzer No. 2, Harvard’s IBM Automatic\r\nSequence-Controlled Calculator, Moore School of Electrical\r\nEngineering’s Electronic Numerical Integrator and Calculator (Eniac),\r\nand Bell Telephone Laboratories’ General-Purpose Relay Computer. All\r\nthese brains have actually worked long enough to have demonstrated\r\nthoroughly some facts of great importance.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT EXISTING MACHINES HAVE PROVED\r\n\r\nThe existing mechanical brains have proved that information can be\r\nautomatically transferred between any two registers of a machine.\r\nNo human being is needed to pick up a physical piece of information\r\nproduced in one part of the machine, personally move it to another part\r\nof the machine, and there put it in again. We can think of a mechanical\r\nbrain as something like a battery of desk calculators or punch-card\r\nmachines all cabled together and communicating automatically.\r\n\r\nThe existing mechanical brains have also proved that flexible,\r\nautomatic control over long sequences of operations is possible. We can\r\nlay out the whole routine to solve a problem, translate it into machine\r\nlanguage, and put it into the machine. Then we press the “start”\r\nbutton; the machine starts whirring and prints out the answers as it\r\nobtains them. Mechanical brains have removed the limits on complexity\r\nof routine: the machine can carry out a complicated routine as easily\r\nas a simple one.\r\n\r\nThe existing giant brains have shown that a machine with hundreds of\r\nthousands of parts will work successfully. It will operate accurately,\r\nit will run unattended, and it will have remarkably few mechanical\r\ntroubles.\r\n\r\nThese machines have shown that enormous speeds can be realized: 5000\r\nadditions a second is Eniac’s record. High speed is needed for many\r\nproblems in science, government, and business. In fact, there are\r\neconomic and statistical problems, now settled by armchair methods,\r\nfor which high-speed mechanical brains may make it possible to compute\r\nanswers rather than guess them.\r\n\r\nAlso, these machines have been shown to be reasonable in cost. The cost\r\nof each of the large calculators is in the neighborhood of $250,000 to\r\n$500,000. If we assume a ten-year life, which is conservative, the cost\r\nis about $3 to $6 an hour for 24-hour operation. Since each mechanical\r\nbrain can, for problems for which it is suited, do the work of a\r\nhundred human computers, such a machine can save its cost half a dozen\r\ntimes. And these machines are only engineers’ models, built without the\r\nadvantages of production-line assembly.\r\n\r\nThe cost of giant mechanical brains under design in 1947 and 1948\r\nis in the neighborhood of $100,000 to $200,000. The main reason for\r\nthe reduction from the previous cost is the use of cheaper automatic\r\nmemory. As designs improve and charges for research and development are\r\npaid off, the cost should continue to go down.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW DEVICES FOR HANDLING INFORMATION\r\n\r\nIn the laboratories working on new mechanical and electronic brains,\r\nscientists are doing a lot of thinking about new devices for handling\r\ninformation. Research into devices for storing information shows that\r\n_magnetic wire_ as used in sound recording is a rather good storage\r\nmedium.\r\n\r\n\r\nMagnetic Wire\r\n\r\nFor example, on a hundredth of an inch of fine steel wire we\r\ncan “write” a _magnetized spot_ by means of a small “writing”\r\n_electromagnet_. The electromagnet is simply some copper wire coiled\r\naround some soft iron shaped in a U. When current flows through the\r\ncoil, the iron becomes a magnet, and the tips of the U magnetize the\r\nlittle section of the wire between them. The magnetized spot can be of\r\ntwo kinds, say north-south or south-north, depending on which way the\r\ncurrent flows. We can “read” this difference by means of another small\r\n“reading” electromagnet. We can erase the spot by means of a stronger\r\n“erasing” magnet that produces a uniform magnetic state throughout the\r\nwire. The difference between north-south and south-north corresponds\r\nto the difference between 1 and 0, or “yes” and “no,” etc., and is\r\na _unit of information_ (see Chapter 2). Many other variations are\r\npossible. For example, the presence or absence of a magnetized spot may\r\nbe the unit of information, or the “writing,” “reading,” and “erasing”\r\nelectromagnets all may be the same.\r\n\r\nMagnetic wire sound recordings made in the 1890’s are still good.\r\nThis fact shows that magnetic wire may be a more permanent medium for\r\nstoring information than is paper. Stray magnetic forces are likely\r\nto have no harmful effect on information stored on magnetic wire, for\r\nthese forces would not be strong enough or detailed enough to change\r\ngreatly the difference between the magnetized spot and its neighboring\r\nneutral area.\r\n\r\nA reel of magnetic wire a mile long and ³/₁₀₀₀ of an inch thick costs\r\nabout $5. At 80 magnetized spots to the inch, a mile of wire can store\r\nabout 5 million units of information. Hence, the cost of storing one\r\nunit of information is about ¹/₁₀₀₀₀ of a cent. The time needed for\r\nchanging a magnetized spot from 1 to 0 or from 0 to 1 is about ¹/₁₀₀₀₀\r\nof a second.\r\n\r\n\r\nMagnetic Tape\r\n\r\nThere is, however, a storage device that may be even more useful, and\r\nthis is _magnetic tape_ (see Fig. 1). The usual size of such tape is ¼\r\ninch wide and 2 or 3 thousandths of an inch thick. Magnetic tape may be\r\nmade of plastic with magnetic powder all through it, or it may be of\r\npaper coated with magnetic powder, or it may be of stainless steel or\r\na magnetic alloy, or it may be of brass or a nonmagnetic alloy coated\r\nwith a magnetic plating.\r\n\r\nMagnetic tape has the added advantage that from 4 to 20 channels across\r\nthe tape can be filled with magnetized spots, and the cost then becomes\r\nabout ¹/₁₀₀₀₀₀ of a cent per spot. It seems possible that 1000 units\r\nof information can be stored in a quarter of a square inch of magnetic\r\ntape. This means that more than 1 million units of information can be\r\nstored in a cubic inch of space filled with magnetic tape, and about 2\r\nbillion units of information in a cubic foot, except that some of the\r\nspace should be allotted to the reels and other equipment that hold\r\nthe tape (see Fig. 2). This is closer packing than printed information\r\nin the telephone book, and yet with magnetic tape we can get to the\r\ninformation automatically.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1. Magnetic tape.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2. Tape reels.]\r\n\r\nThink of the enormous files in libraries, government, and business.\r\nThink of the problems of space and cost and access which these files\r\nimply. We can then see that this new development may well be of\r\nextraordinary importance.\r\n\r\n\r\nMercury Tanks\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3. Mercury tank.]\r\n\r\nScientists are investigating other storage devices having still more\r\nremarkable properties, but these have the disadvantage that, when the\r\npower goes off, the information vanishes. One of these new storage\r\ndevices is called a _mercury tank_ (see Fig. 3). It consists mainly\r\nof a section of iron or steel pipe filled with mercury. At each end\r\nof this pipe, touching the mercury, is a thin slab of a crystal of\r\n_quartz_. Quartz, which is a common stone, and which nearly all sand\r\nis made of, changes its shape when pulsed with electricity. We put a\r\npattern of electrical pulses into the quartz slab at one end of the\r\nmercury tank; for example, we could have the pattern 1101 meaning\r\n“pulse, pulse, no pulse, pulse.” The electrical pulses going into the\r\nquartz slab make the quartz vibrate. Thus ripples are produced in the\r\nmercury, and waves in the pattern 1101 meaning “wave, wave, no wave,\r\nwave” travel down the tank and strike the quartz slab at the far end.\r\nThe quartz slab there changes its shape in the rhythm 1101, and it\r\nconverts the waves back into electrical pulses in the same pattern.\r\nThen we take the pulses out of the far end along a wire, make them\r\nstronger again with an amplifier, give them the right form again, and\r\nfeed them back into the front end of the mercury tank. The mercury tank\r\nis a clever use of the principle of an _echo_, as when you call across\r\na valley and the rocks answer you back. We can store a pattern of 400\r\npulses (each a unit of information, a 1 or a 0, and each a millionth\r\nof a second in duration), in a mercury tank about 20 inches long. A\r\nmercury tank and an echo are examples of _delay lines_—“lines” along\r\nwhich waves are “delayed.”\r\n\r\n\r\nElectrostatic Storage Tube\r\n\r\nAnother of the memory devices being developed is called an\r\n_electrostatic storage tube_ (see Fig. 4). This is a big electronic\r\ntube with a _screen_ across one end. The screen may be of two layers:\r\none of copper, which conducts electricity, and one of _mica_, a\r\nmaterial that does not. In the other end of the tube is a _beam_ of\r\nelectrons, which we can turn on and off and shoot at any of 2 or 3\r\nthousand specific points or _spots_ on the screen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4. Electrostatic storage tube.]\r\n\r\nThere are two sizes of _electric charge_ or quantity of electrons; we\r\ncan call these 1 and 0. In about a millionth of a second, we can put\r\neither size of charge on one of the spots of the screen. With other\r\ncircuits we can keep it there as long as we want, if the power does\r\nnot flicker off. We can “remember” perhaps 2 or 3 thousand units of\r\ninformation in one of these electronic tubes. We can read, write, or\r\nerase any unit of information in a few millionths of a second.\r\n\r\nNeither the mercury tank nor the electrostatic storage tube had, by the\r\nend of 1947, been put into a working mechanical brain. But there is\r\ngood reason to believe that they will be successful devices and will\r\nopen up a new era of speed in storing and referring to information.\r\nIn fact, several laboratories are developing electronic calculating\r\ncircuits using these devices which will perform up to 100,000 additions\r\na second or 10,000 multiplications a second. Our minds certainly\r\nstagger at the thought of such speeds.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW OPERATIONS\r\n\r\nMany kinds of combining operations have already been built into one or\r\nmore mechanical brains. The operations may be arithmetical: addition,\r\nsubtraction, multiplication, division, looking up numbers in tables,\r\netc. Or the operations may be logical: comparing, selecting, checking,\r\netc. Additional logical operations will be built into some of the\r\nmechanical brains now being constructed: sorting, collating, matching,\r\nmerging, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW IDEAS IN PROGRAMMING\r\n\r\n_Programming_—the way to give instructions to machines—is also being\r\nstudied in the laboratories. Several new ideas of importance have\r\ndeveloped as a result.\r\n\r\nOne idea is that the machine should be able to store its instructions\r\nor _program_ or _routine_ in its memory in just the same physical ways\r\nas it stores numbers. There is basically no reason why numbers only\r\nshould be stored in some registers, and instructions only stored in\r\nother registers.\r\n\r\nAnother idea is that the machine should have in its permanent memory\r\nany subroutine it may need. For example, a subroutine should always be\r\navailable in the machine for finding _square root_. At any time when a\r\nsquare root was needed, we would only have to call on the machine for\r\nthe subroutine of square root. The machine would then consult the right\r\npart of its memory and carry out the subroutine for square root.\r\n\r\nA third idea, and one of the most interesting, is that the machine\r\nshould be able to compute its own instructions. For example, consider a\r\nprogram for finding the product of two _matrices_ (see Supplement 2),\r\neach of 100 terms in an array of 10 columns and 10 rows, resulting in a\r\nnew _matrix_ of 100 terms. The whole program can be made to consist of\r\nabout 50 orders. Only one of them is “multiply,” and only one of them\r\nis “add”; the other orders consist of how to choose expressions to be\r\nmultiplied or added, etc.\r\n\r\nSuch problems as these are often fascinating to mathematicians, who\r\nlove to play with the intricate ideas needed.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW IDEAS IN RELIABILITY\r\n\r\nReliability has a number of aspects:\r\n\r\n    1. No wrong results allowed out of the machine.\r\n\r\n    2. Few failures.\r\n\r\n    3. Rapid location of failures.\r\n\r\n    4. Quick repair or replacement of parts that fail.\r\n\r\n    5. Easy maintenance.\r\n\r\n    6. Unattended operation overnight.\r\n\r\nFor example, Bell Laboratories proved that mechanical brains can be\r\nbuilt so that no wrong results are allowed to come out. In other words,\r\nthe machine checks itself all the time as it goes along and stops at\r\nonce if the check shows that something is wrong. This is likely to be a\r\nstandard feature of new automatic thinking machinery.\r\n\r\nThe frequency of failures in the machinery being designed in the\r\nlaboratories may be of the order of one or two mechanical failures\r\na week. For any type of failure an alarm circuit and trouble lights\r\nwill show what part of the machine needs attention. Plug-in parts for\r\nreplacement are already in use in at least two of the four mechanical\r\nbrains described and should be available in all the new machines. It is\r\npossible to build a machine that will automatically change from failing\r\nequipment to properly functioning equipment. For some years though,\r\nthis may be too expensive to be reasonable.\r\n\r\nThe use of magnetic tape for storage reduces greatly the number of\r\nparts and so increases reliability. For example, instead of 18,000\r\nelectronic tubes in an electronic brain, there may be less than 3000.\r\n\r\nA final degree of reliability is gained when most of the time the\r\nmachine operates unattended. Then, there is no human operator standing\r\nby who may fail to do the correct thing at the moment when the machine\r\nneeds some attention. In fact, the motto for the room housing a\r\nmechanical brain should become, “Don’t think; let the machine do it\r\nfor you.” Unattended operation from the end of one working day to\r\nthe beginning of the next, with the machine changing itself from one\r\nproblem to another problem, has already been proved possible on the\r\nBell Laboratories machine.\r\n\r\n\r\nAUXILIARY DEVICES\r\n\r\nIn order to use a mechanical brain, we have to give it and take from it\r\nlanguage that it understands, _machine language_. A mechanical brain\r\nthat can do 10,000 additions a second can very easily finish almost\r\nall its work at once. How can we, slow as we are, keep our friend,\r\nthe giant brain, busy? We have found so far several answers to this\r\nquestion, none of them yet very good.\r\n\r\nDevices for preparing input will be very important. For each brain, we\r\nshall need a great many of these devices. For, at best, we type at a\r\nrate, say, of 4 characters a second, selecting any one of some 38 keys,\r\neach of which is equivalent to about 6 units of information. This is\r\nabout 800 units of information per second. The machine, however, is\r\nlikely to be able to gulp information from its input mechanism at the\r\namazing rate of 60,000 units of information per second, equal to 75\r\npeople typing with no mistakes and no resting. Fortunately, at least\r\nsome of the time the machine will be busy computing!\r\n\r\nFor an input-preparation device, we may get something that can be\r\nfastened to an ordinary typewriter and that will produce magnetic\r\ntape agreeing with what is printed by the typewriter. Since the input\r\ninformation must be carefully verified, we shall need a second magnetic\r\ntape device such as exists for paper tape on the Bell Laboratories\r\nmachine: the _processor_. The processor takes two hand-prepared tapes,\r\ncompares them, reports any differences, and produces a third tape. The\r\nthird tape copies the two original tapes if they agree, and it receives\r\ncorrected information as furnished by a girl at a keyboard if the two\r\noriginal tapes disagree.\r\n\r\nFor information already on punch cards, we need an input device that\r\nwill read punch cards and write on magnetic tape. Where information is\r\non punched paper tape, we need a machine that will read punched paper\r\ntape and write on magnetic tape.\r\n\r\nProblem data, tables of numbers, and routine instructions will go\r\ninto the mechanical brain. They will all be prepared on regular input\r\ndevices. The machine will accept information in the form in which it is\r\nmost convenient for you and me to prepare it. Then, the machine will\r\nbe instructed to change the information into the form with which it is\r\nmost convenient for the machine to operate.\r\n\r\nMany output devices will also be needed, since the machine will be able\r\nto produce information very swiftly. These output devices might be\r\ncabled to the machine. A kind of traffic control system would govern\r\nthem. Each will have a magnetic tape that will be loaded up swiftly\r\nwith information. Then the output device will unload its information\r\nmore slowly, in any form that we may desire: printing, graphs, film,\r\npunch cards, or punched paper tape.\r\n\r\nThe machine is likely to be able to put out information on magnetic\r\ntape at the same high speed of 60,000 units of information per\r\nsecond or 10,000 characters per second. But the best printing speed\r\nof an electric typewriter is about 10 or 12 characters a second.\r\nCard-punching speed is about 130 characters a second. Punch-card\r\ntabulator speed can reach a maximum of about 200 characters a second.\r\nThus we see that here, too, we may be snowed under with the information\r\nthat the giant brain puts out, if we fail to ask the giant only for\r\nwhat we really want.\r\n\r\n\r\nMECHANICAL BRAINS UNDER CONSTRUCTION\r\n\r\nThis chapter would not be complete without mention of the great\r\nmechanical brains that were actually under construction at the end of\r\n1947. In power they are intermediate between the machinery now being\r\ndesigned, described in this chapter, and the earlier machines described\r\nin the previous chapters of this book.\r\n\r\nThe mechanical brains under construction on December 31, 1947, were:\r\n\r\n    Harvard’s Sequence-Controlled Relay Calculator _Mark\r\n      II_, constructed at the Harvard Computation\r\n      Laboratory, tested there July 1947 to January 1948,\r\n      and delivered to the Naval Proving Ground, Dahlgren,\r\n      Va., in 1948.\r\n\r\n    The _IBM Selective-Sequence Electronic\r\n      Calculator_, constructed in the IBM laboratories,\r\n      Endicott, N. Y., and installed in 1947 at the office\r\n      of International Business Machines, 590 Madison Ave.,\r\n      New York, N. Y.\r\n\r\n    Moore School of Electrical Engineering’s _EDVAC_\r\n      (Electronic Digital Variable Automatic Computer)\r\n      being constructed partly at Moore School and partly\r\n      elsewhere, and to be delivered to the Ballistic\r\n      Research Laboratories, Aberdeen, Md.\r\n\r\n    Harvard’s Sequence-Controlled Electronic Calculator\r\n      _Mark III_, being constructed at the Harvard\r\n      Computation Laboratory, and to be delivered to the\r\n      Naval Proving Ground, Dahlgren, Va.\r\n\r\nWe shall cover briefly (and perhaps a little technically) some of the\r\nmain features of the first two of these machines; for, during 1948,\r\nthey began to do problems. The other two had not been finished by\r\nthe end of 1948 and so would be difficult to describe correctly, for\r\nmechanical brains _grow_, and design changes go on until they are\r\nfinished—and even afterwards.\r\n\r\nSome information about these machines can be obtained from the\r\norganizations referred to above and from reports that should appear\r\nfrom time to time in some of the journals mentioned in Supplement\r\n3. There is also a regular section entitled “Automatic Computing\r\nMachinery” in the quarterly _Mathematical Tables and Other Aids to\r\nComputation_, where it is likely that current information may be found.\r\n\r\n\r\nHarvard’s Mark II\r\n\r\nThe Harvard Sequence-Controlled Calculator Mark II began to do problems\r\nunder test during July 1947. This machine is at least twelve times as\r\npowerful as Mark I (see Chapter 6) and was constructed entirely by\r\nthe Harvard Computation Laboratory. The machine contains about 13,000\r\nrelays of a new type that will operate reliably within ¹/₁₀₀ of a\r\nsecond.\r\n\r\nNumbers in the machine are regularly of 10 decimal digits between\r\n1.000,000,000 and 9.999,999,999, inclusive, multiplied by a power of 10\r\nbetween 1,000,000,000,000,000 and 0.000,000,000,000,001, inclusive.\r\n\r\nFor storage of numbers, the machine has 100 relay registers totaling\r\nabout 1200 decimal digits. Also, it can consult any one of 8 tape feeds\r\nfor numbers and any one of 4 tape feeds for instructions. Effectively,\r\nthe machine can read one number and one instruction from paper tape in\r\n¹/₃₀ of a second.\r\n\r\nThe machine performs all arithmetical and most logical operations.\r\nIn every second it can carry out 4 multiplications, 8 additions (or\r\nsubtractions), and 12 transfers. Division is performed by rapid\r\napproximation using the other operations.\r\n\r\nIn each second the machine can perform 30 instructions. An instruction\r\nis expressed by 6 digits between 0 and 7 which you can select and, in\r\neffect, by 3 more digits fixed by the time (within the second) when the\r\nmachine reads the instruction. For example, in the 9th instruction of\r\nthe 30 instructions in each second, we can specify a multiplicand. But,\r\nif we do not want to multiply right then—a rare event if we are coding\r\nwisely—we leave the 9th instruction empty. The machine may operate as a\r\nwhole, attending to one problem; or the machine may be separated into\r\nhalves, and each half will attend to its own problem.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe IBM Selective-Sequence Electronic Calculator\r\n\r\nThe IBM Selective-Sequence Electronic Calculator was announced publicly\r\non January 27, 1948, after some months of trial running. It is a large\r\nand powerful mechanical brain, and it is the intention of International\r\nBusiness Machines to devote it to solving scientific problems. The\r\nstaff of the Watson Scientific Computing Laboratory in New York will be\r\nmainly in charge of the machine.\r\n\r\nThe machine contains about 12,500 electronic tubes and about 21,500\r\nrelays. Numbers in the machine are regularly of either 14 or 19\r\ndecimal digits. Instructions are expressed as numbers. For storage of\r\ninformation, the machine has a capacity of 8 registers totaling 160\r\ndecimal digits of very rapid memory in electronic tubes. Also, it has\r\nabout 150 registers totaling 3000 decimal digits of less rapid memory\r\nin relays. Also, it can consult any one of 66 paper tape feeds; each\r\nrow on a paper tape can hold up to 78 punched holes or 19 decimal\r\ndigits, and the machine can consult 25 rows on one tape in one second.\r\nThese paper tapes together give the machine about 400,000 decimal\r\ndigits of memory.\r\n\r\nFor arithmetical and logical operations, the machine has an\r\narithmetical unit using electronic tubes. This unit can carry out about\r\n50 multiplications or about 250 additions per second, including the\r\ntransfers of numbers. In each second the machine can read and perform\r\n50 instructions, and each instruction consists, usually, of getting\r\ntwo numbers out of two relay registers, performing an operation, and\r\nputting the result into a third relay register.\r\n\r\n\r\nEckert-Mauchly’s Binac\r\n\r\nAs this book went to press, another mechanical brain, the Electronic\r\nBinary Automatic Computer, or BINAC, was announced on August 22,\r\n1949. This machine was constructed by the Eckert-Mauchly Computer\r\nCorporation, Philadelphia, Pa., for Northrop Aircraft, Inc., Hawthorne,\r\nCalif.\r\n\r\nThis machine has some remarkable properties. It does addition or\r\nsubtraction at the rate of 3500 per second. It does multiplication or\r\ndivision at the rate of 1000 per second. The input is from a keyboard\r\nor magnetic tape; the output is to magnetic tape or an electric\r\ntypewriter. Binac has 512 registers of very rapid memory in mercury\r\ntanks, and each register holds 30 binary digits. The machine actually\r\nis a pair of twins: the storage, the computing element, and the control\r\nare double, and each twin runs in step with the other and checks\r\nevery operation of the other. In tests in July the machine ran over\r\n10 consecutive hours with no error. Each twin has only 700 electronic\r\ntubes. Binac handles all numbers in binary notation, except that the\r\nkeyboard and the typewriter express numbers in _octal notation_ (see\r\nSupplement 2). Finally, Binac is only 5 feet high, 4 feet long, and one\r\nfoot wide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 11\r\n\r\nTHE FUTURE:\r\n\r\nMACHINES THAT THINK, AND WHAT THEY MIGHT DO FOR MEN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe pen is mightier than the sword, it is often said. And if this is\r\ntrue, then the pen with a motor may be mightier than the sword with a\r\nmotor.\r\n\r\nIn the Middle Ages, there were few kinds of weapons, and it was easy\r\nfor a man to protect himself against most of them by wearing armor.\r\nAs gunpowder came into use, a man could no longer carry the weight of\r\narmor that would protect him, and so armor was given up. But in 1917,\r\narmor, equipped with a motor and carrying the man and his weapons, came\r\nback into service—as the tank.\r\n\r\nIn much the same way, in the Middle Ages, there were few books, and it\r\nwas easy for a man to handle nearly all the information that was in\r\nbooks. As the printing press came into use, man’s brain could no longer\r\nhandle all recorded information, and the effort to do so was given\r\nup. But in 1944, a brain to handle information, equipped with a motor\r\nand supporting the man and his reasoning, came into existence—as the\r\nsequence-controlled calculator.\r\n\r\nIn previous chapters we have examined some of the giant mechanical\r\nbrains that have been finished; we have also considered the design\r\nof such machines. Now in this chapter we shall discuss the future\r\nsignificance of machines that think, of motorized information. We shall\r\ndiscuss what we can foresee if we look with imagination into the future.\r\n\r\nThere are two questions we need to ask: What types of machines that\r\nthink can we foresee? What types of problems to be solved by these\r\nmachines can we foresee?\r\n\r\n\r\nFUTURE TYPES OF MACHINES THAT THINK\r\n\r\nThe machines that already exist show that some processes of thinking\r\ncan already be performed very quickly:\r\n\r\n    Calculating: adding, subtracting,...\r\n    Reasoning: comparing, selecting,...\r\n    Referring: looking up information in lists,...\r\n\r\nWe can expect other processes of thinking to come up to high speed\r\nthrough the further development of thinking machines.\r\n\r\n\r\nAutomatic Address Book\r\n\r\nNowadays when we wish to send out announcements of an event, like going\r\nto South America for a year, we may copy the addresses of our friends\r\nonto the envelopes by hand. In the future, we can see our address book\r\nas a spool of magnetic tape. When we wish to send out announcements,\r\nwe put a stack of blank envelopes into the machine that will read the\r\nmagnetic tape, and we press a button. Out will come the envelopes\r\naddressed.\r\n\r\nIf we wish to select only those friends of ours whose last names we put\r\ndown on a list, we can write the list on another magnetic tape, place\r\nit also in the machine, and set a few switches. Then the machine will\r\nread the names on the list, find their addresses in the address-book\r\ntape, and prepare only the envelopes we want. If a friend’s address\r\nchanges, we can notify the machine. It will find his old address, erase\r\nit, and enter the new address.\r\n\r\n\r\nAutomatic Library\r\n\r\nWe can foresee the development of machinery that will make it possible\r\nto consult information in a library automatically. Suppose that you\r\ngo into the library of the future and wish to look up ways for making\r\nbiscuits. You will be able to dial into the catalogue machine “making\r\nbiscuits.” There will be a flutter of movie film in the machine. Soon\r\nit will stop, and, in front of you on the screen, will be projected\r\nthe part of the catalogue which shows the names of three or four books\r\ncontaining recipes for biscuits. If you are satisfied, you will press\r\na button; a copy of what you saw will be made for you and come out of\r\nthe machine.\r\n\r\nAfter further development, all the pages of all books will be available\r\nby machine. Then, when you press the right button, you will be able to\r\nget from the machine a copy of the exact recipe for biscuits that you\r\nchoose.\r\n\r\nWe are not yet at the end of foreseeable development. There will be\r\na third stage. You will then have in your home an automatic cooking\r\nmachine operated by program tapes. You will stock it with various\r\nsupplies, and it will put together and cook whatever dishes you desire.\r\nThen, what you will need from the library will be a program or routine\r\non magnetic tape to control your automatic cook. And the library,\r\ninstead of producing a pictorial copy of the recipe for you to read and\r\napply, will produce a routine on magnetic tape for controlling your\r\ncooking machine so that you will actually get excellent biscuits!\r\n\r\nOf course, you may have other kinds of automatic producing machinery in\r\nyour home or office. The furnishing of routines to control automatic\r\nmachinery will become a business of importance.\r\n\r\n\r\nAutomatic Translator\r\n\r\nAnother machine that we can foresee would be used for translating from\r\none language to any other. We can call it an _automatic translator_.\r\nSuppose that you want to say “How much?” in Swedish. You dial into the\r\nmachine “How much?” and press the button “Swedish,” and the machine\r\nwill promptly write out “Hur mycket?” for you. It also will pronounce\r\nit, if you wish, for there would be little difficulty in recording on\r\nmagnetic tape the pronunciation of the word as spoken by a good speaker\r\nof the language. The machine could be set to repeat the pronunciation\r\nseveral times so that the student could really learn the sound. He\r\ncould learn it better, probably, by hearing it and trying to say it\r\nthan he could by using any set of written symbols.\r\n\r\n\r\nAutomatic Typist\r\n\r\nWe now come to a possible machine that uses a new principle. This\r\nprinciple is that of being able to _recognize_ signs. This machine\r\nwould perceive writing on a piece of paper and recognize that all the\r\n_a_’s that appear on the paper are cases of _a_, and that all the _b_’s\r\nthat appear on it are instances of _b_, and so forth. The machine could\r\nthen control an electric typewriter and copy the marks that it sees.\r\nThe first stage of this machine would be one in which only printed\r\ncharacters of a high degree of likeness could be recognized. In later\r\nstages, handwriting, even rather illegible handwriting, might be\r\nrecognizable by the machine. We can call it an _automatic typist_.\r\n\r\nThe elements of the automatic typist would be the following:\r\n\r\n    1. _Phototubes_ (electronic tubes sensitive to\r\n        the brightness of light), which could sense the\r\n        difference between black and white (these already\r\n        exist).\r\n\r\n    2. A memory of the shapes of 52 letters, 10 digits,\r\n        and punctuation marks. Fine distinctions would be\r\n        required of this memory in some cases—like the\r\n        difference between the numeral 5 and the capital\r\n        letter S.\r\n\r\n    3. A control that would cause the machine to\r\n        _tune_ itself, so that a good matching between\r\n        the marks it observed and the shapes it remembered\r\n        would be reached.\r\n\r\n    4. A _triggering control_ so that, when the\r\n        machine had reached good enough matching between\r\n        its observations and its memory, the machine would\r\n        proceed to identify the marks, read them, and\r\n        transfer them.\r\n\r\n    5. An electric typewriter, which would respond to\r\n        the transferred instructions. (This also already\r\n        exists.)\r\n\r\nThis machine is perhaps not so farfetched as it might seem. During\r\nWorld War II, gun-aiming equipment using the new technique _radar_\r\nreached a high stage of development. Many shots that disabled and sank\r\nenemy ships were fired in total darkness by radar-controlled guns.\r\nOn the glowing screen in the control room, there were two spots, one\r\nthat marked the target and one that reported the point at which the\r\ngun was aimed. These two spots could be brought almost automatically\r\ninto agreement. In the same way, a report from a phototube telling\r\nthe shape of an observed mark and a report from the memory of the\r\nmachine telling the shape of a similar mark could be compared by the\r\nmachine for likeness and, if judged enough alike, could be approved as\r\nidentical.\r\n\r\nEven the phrase “enough alike” can be applied by a machine. During\r\nWorld War II, tremendous advances were made in machinery for\r\ndeciphering enemy messages. Machines observed various features and\r\npatterns in enemy messages, swiftly counted the frequency of these\r\nfeatures, and carried out statistical tests. Then the machines selected\r\nthose few cases in which the patterns showed meaning instead of\r\nrandomness.\r\n\r\nA machine like the automatic typist, if made flexible enough, would\r\nbe, of course, extremely useful. A great load of dull office work is\r\nnow being thrown on clerks whose task is to translate from writing and\r\ntyping into languages that machines can read, such as punch cards.\r\nAt the present time, if punch-card machines are widely used in a big\r\ncompany, the company must employ large numbers of girls whose sole\r\nduty is to read papers and punch up cards. A still bigger chore is the\r\nwork of typists in all kinds of businesses whose main duty is to read\r\nhandwriting, etc., and then copy the words on a typewriter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Each square in the grill is watched by a phototube.\r\n\r\nFIG. 1. Scheme for distinguishing _A_ and _H_ by 15\r\nphototubes.]\r\n\r\nResearch has already begun on various features of the automatic typist\r\nbecause of its obvious labor-saving value. For example, many patents\r\nhave been issued on schemes for dividing the area occupied by a letter\r\nor a digit into an array of spots, with a battery of phototubes\r\neach watching a spot. The reports from the phototubes together will\r\ndistinguish the letter or digit. For example, if we consider _A_ and\r\n_H_ placed in a grill of fifteen spots, 5 long by 3 wide (see Fig.\r\n1), then the phototubes can distinguish between _A_ and _H_ by sensing\r\nblack or white in the spot in the middle of the top row. When we\r\nconsider how easily and swiftly a human being does this, we can once\r\nmore marvel at the recognizing machine we all carry around with us in\r\nour heads.\r\n\r\n\r\nAutomatic Stenographer\r\n\r\nAnother development that we can foresee is one that we can call the\r\n_automatic stenographer_. This is a machine that will listen to sounds\r\nand write them down in properly spelled English words. The elements of\r\nthis machine can be outlined:\r\n\r\n        1. Microphones, which can sense spoken sounds (these\r\n            already exist).\r\n\r\n        2. A memory storing the 40 (more or less) phonetic\r\n            units or sounds that make up English, such as the\r\n            23 consonant sounds,\r\n\r\n        _p_    _b_    _l_    _ng_\r\n        _f_    _v_    _m_    _th_\r\n        _t_    _d_    _n_    _r_\r\n        _s_    _z_    _h_    _y_\r\n        _k_    _g_           _w_\r\n        _ch_   _j_\r\n        _sh_   _zh_ (heard in “pleasure”)\r\n\r\n    and the 17 vowel sounds,\r\n\r\n              LONG            SHORT           OTHER\r\n        _A_  (“ate”)    _a_  (“cat”)    _ar_ (“are”)\r\n        _E_  (“eat”)    _e_  (“end”)    _aw_ (“awe”)\r\n        _I_  (“isle”)   _i_  (“in”)     _er_ (“err”)\r\n        _O_  (“owe”)    _o_  (“on”)     _ow_ (“owl”)\r\n        _U_  (“cute”)   _u_  (“up”)     _oi_ (“oil”)\r\n        _OO_ (“roof”)   _oo_ (“book”)\r\n\r\n        3. A collection of the rules of spelling in English,\r\n            containing many statements like\r\n\r\n        The sound _b_ is always spelled _b_\r\n\r\n        The sound _sh_ may be spelled _sh_ (ship), _s_ (sugar),\r\n            _ti_ (station), _ci_ (physician), _ce_ (ocean) or\r\n            _tu_ (picture) and other statements based on context,\r\n            word lists, derivation, etc. These are the statements\r\n            by means of which a good English speller knows how to\r\n            spell even words that he hears for the first time.\r\n\r\n        4. A triggering control so that, when the machine\r\n            reaches good enough matching between its\r\n            observations of sounds, its memory of sounds, and\r\n            its knowledge of spelling rules, the machine will\r\n            identify groups of sounds as words, determine their\r\n            spelling, and report the letters determined.\r\n\r\n        5. An electric typewriter, which would type the\r\n            reported letters.\r\n\r\nWith this type of machine, you would dictate your letters into a\r\nmachine (now existing) that would record your voice. Then the record\r\nwould be placed on the automatic stenographer, and out would come your\r\nletters written and spaced as they should be.\r\n\r\n\r\nAutomatic Recognizer\r\n\r\nWe can foresee a recognizing machine with very general powers. Suppose\r\nthat we call it an _automatic recognizer_ (see Fig. 2). It will have\r\nthe following elements:\r\n\r\n    1. _Input._ This element will consist of a set\r\n        of observing instruments, capable of perceiving\r\n        sights, sounds, etc. There will be ways of\r\n        positioning or _tuning_ these instruments.\r\n\r\n    2. _Memory._ This element will store knowledge.\r\n        It may store the patterns of observations that we\r\n        are interested in; or it may store general rules on\r\n        how to find patterns of observations that we will\r\n        be interested in. It will contain knowledge about\r\n        acceptable groups of patterns, about actions to be\r\n        performed in response to patterns, etc.\r\n\r\n    3. _Program 1._ The element “Program 1” performs\r\n        a set of standard instructions. Under these\r\n        instructions, the machine:\r\n\r\n    Compares group after group of observations with the\r\n        information in the memory.\r\n\r\n    Compares these groups with patterns furnished, or seeks\r\n        to organize the observations into patterns.\r\n\r\n    Counts cases and tests frequencies.\r\n\r\n    Finds out how much matching with patterns there is.\r\n\r\n    Tunes the observing instruments in ways to increase\r\n        matching.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2. Scheme of an automatic recognizer.]\r\n\r\n    4. _Program 2._ The element “Program 2” performs\r\n        another set of standard instructions. Under these\r\n        instructions, the machine, if it is tuned well,\r\n        matches sets of observations one after another with\r\n        the patterns and so reads them.\r\n\r\n    5. _Triggering Control._ This element shifts the\r\n        control of the machine from Program 1 to Program\r\n        2. It does this when the machine reaches “good\r\n        matching.” We shall set the meaning of this into\r\n        the machine in much the same way as we set “warm”\r\n        into a thermostat.\r\n\r\n    6. _Output._ This element performs any action\r\n        that we want, depending on recognized patterns read\r\n        and any other knowledge or instructions stored in\r\n        the memory.\r\n\r\nThe automatic recognizer will be capable of extraordinary tasks. With\r\nmicrophones and a large memory, this type of machine would be able to\r\nhear a foreign language spoken and translate it into spoken or written\r\nEnglish. With phototubes and with an expanded filtering and decoding\r\ncapacity as in deciphering machines, the automatic recognizer should be\r\nable to read a dead language, even those (such as Minoan or Etruscan)\r\nthat have so far resisted efforts to read it. The machine would derive\r\nrules for the translation of the language and translate any sample.\r\n\r\nAn automatic recognizer could perhaps be equipped with many sensitive,\r\ntiny observing instruments that could be placed around or in the brain\r\nand nervous systems of animals. Then the machine might enable us to\r\nfind out what activity in the nervous system corresponds with what\r\nactivity in the animal.\r\n\r\n\r\nTYPES OF PROBLEMS THAT MACHINES WILL SOLVE IN THE FUTURE\r\n\r\nWe turn now to the second question regarding the future of machines\r\nthat think: What types of problems can we foresee as solved by these\r\nmachines?\r\n\r\n\r\nProblems of Control\r\n\r\nProbably the foremost problem which machines that think can solve is\r\nautomatic control over all sorts of other machines. This involves\r\ncontrolling a machine that is running so that it will do the right\r\nthing at the right time in response to information. For example,\r\nsuppose that you are mowing a lawn with a mowing machine. You watch\r\nthe preceding strip so as to stay next to it. You watch the ends of\r\nthe strips, where you turn around. If a stick is caught in the cutting\r\nblade, you stop and take it out. Now it is entirely possible to put\r\ndevices on the mowing machine so that all these things will be taken\r\ncare of automatically. In fact, in the case of plowing a large field,\r\na tractor-plow can be equipped with a device that guides it next to\r\nthe preceding furrow. Thus, once the first furrow around the edge has\r\nbeen made, riderless tractors will plow a whole field and stop in the\r\nmiddle.\r\n\r\nFor another example, take a gas furnace for heating steam to keep a\r\nhouse warm. Such a furnace has automatic controls, which respond to the\r\nfollowing information whenever reported:\r\n\r\n    House too warm.\r\n    House not warm enough.\r\n    Too much steam pressure.\r\n    Not enough water in boiler.\r\n    Gas flame not lit.\r\n    Daytime.\r\n    Nighttime.\r\n\r\nIn fact, your own meaning of “warm” can be put into the control system:\r\nyou set the dial on your thermostat at the temperature that “warm” is\r\nto be for you.\r\n\r\nIn the future many kinds of automatic control will be common. We shall\r\nhave automatic pilots for flying and landing airplanes. We shall\r\nhave automatic missiles for destructive purposes, such as bombing\r\nand killing, and for constructive purposes, such as delivering mail\r\nand fast freight. An article in the magazine _Fortune_ for November\r\n1946 described the automatic factory (see Supplement 3). This is a\r\nfactory in which there would be automatic arms for holding stuff being\r\nmanufactured, and automatic feed lines for supplying material just\r\nwhere it is needed. All this factory would be controlled by machines\r\nthat handle information automatically and produce actions that respond\r\nto information.\r\n\r\nThis prospect fills us with concern as well as with amazement. How\r\nshall we control these automatic machines, these robots, these\r\nFrankensteins? What will there be left for us to do to earn our living?\r\nBut more of this in the next chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\nProblems of Science\r\n\r\nOther problems for which we can foresee the use of machines that think\r\nare the understanding, and later the controlling, of nature. One of\r\nthese problems is weather forecasting and weather control.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Weather Brain\r\n\r\nWe can imagine the following type of machine—a _weather brain_. A\r\nthousand weather observatories all over the country observe the weather\r\nat 8 A.M. The observations are fed automatically through a countrywide\r\nnetwork of communication lines into a central station. Here a giant\r\nmachine, containing a great deal of scientific knowledge about the\r\nweather, takes in all the data reported to it. At 8:15 the weather\r\nbrain starts to calculate; in half an hour it has finished, having\r\nproduced an excellent forecast of the weather for the whole country.\r\nThen it proceeds to transmit its forecast all over the country. By 8:50\r\nevery weather station, newspaper, radio station, and airport in the\r\ncountry has the details. In October 1945, Dr. V. K. Zworykin of the\r\nPrinceton Laboratories of the Radio Corporation of America proposed\r\nsolving the problem of weather forecasting in this way by a giant brain.\r\n\r\nThe weather brain will have a second stage of application. From time to\r\ntime and here and there, the weather is unstable: it can be triggered\r\nto behave in one way or another. For example, recently, pellets of\r\n_frozen carbon dioxide_—often called Dry Ice—have been dropped from\r\nplanes and have caused rain. In fact, a few pounds of Dry Ice have\r\napparently caused several hundred tons of rain or snow. In similar\r\nways, we may, for example, turn away a hail storm so that hail will\r\nfall over a barren mountain instead of over a farming valley and\r\nthus protect crops. Or we may dispel conditions that would lead to a\r\ntornado, thus avoiding its damage. Both these examples involve local\r\nweather disturbances. However, even the greatest weather disturbances,\r\nlike hurricanes and blizzards, may eventually be directed to some\r\nextent. Thus the weather may become to some degree subject to man’s\r\ncontrol, and the weather brain will be able to tell men where and when\r\nto take action.\r\n\r\n\r\nPsychological Testing\r\n\r\nAnother scientific problem to which new machinery for handling\r\ninformation applies is the problem of understanding human beings and\r\ntheir behavior. This increased understanding may lead to much wiser\r\ndealing with human behavior.\r\n\r\nFor example, consider tests of aptitudes. If you take one of these\r\ntests, you may be asked to mark which word out of five suggested ones\r\nis nearest in meaning to a given word. Or your test may be 40 simple\r\narithmetical problems to be solved in 25 minutes. Or you may be given\r\na sheet with 20 circles, and be asked to put 3 dots in the first, 7\r\ndots in the second, 4 dots in the third, 11 dots in the fourth, and\r\nso on, irregularly; you may be given a total of 45 seconds to do this\r\nas well as you can. Now, if a vocational counselor gives you one of\r\nthese tests, and if you get 84 out of 100 on it, he needs to know just\r\nwhat he has measured about you. Also, he needs to know whether he can\r\nreasonably forecast that, as a result of your grade of 84, you will\r\nbe good at writing articles, or good at supervising the work of other\r\npeople, or good at designing in a machine shop. He needs to know the\r\nrecords of people with scores of about 84 on this test and to have\r\nevidence supporting his forecasts.\r\n\r\nIf we wish to make the most use of the tests, we need to carry out a\r\ngood deal of statistics, mathematics, and logic. For example, it will\r\nturn out that answers to some questions are much more significant\r\nthan answers to others, and so we can greatly improve the quality of\r\nthe tests by keeping only the more significant questions. Powerful\r\nmachinery for handling calculations will be very useful in the field of\r\naptitude testing.\r\n\r\nBut, you may ask, what if the person analyzing your answers has to use\r\ninterpretations and judgments? If the judgments and interpretations can\r\nbe expressed in words, and if the words can be translated into machine\r\nlanguage, then the machine can carry out the analysis. Usually the\r\ndifference between a rule and a judgment is simply this: a rule in a\r\ncase in which it is hard to express all the factors being considered is\r\ncalled a judgment.\r\n\r\n\r\nPsychological Trainer\r\n\r\nIt is conceivable that machines that think can eventually be applied\r\nin the actual treatment of mental illness and maladjustment. Consider\r\nwhat a physician does. In treating a psychiatric case, such as a\r\n_neurosis_, a physician uses words almost entirely. He asks questions.\r\nHe listens to the patient’s answers. Each answer takes the physician\r\nnearer and nearer to a diagnosis. By and by the physician knows what\r\nmost of the difficulty is. Then he must present his knowledge slowly\r\nto the patient, gradually guiding the patient to understanding. It is\r\na psychological truth that telling a man in ten minutes what is wrong\r\nwith him does not cure him. The physician seeks to free the patient\r\nfrom the tormenting circles of habit and worry in which he has been\r\ntrapped. Often the diagnosis is short and the treatment is long; the\r\nreasons for the neurosis may soon be clear to the physician, but they\r\nmay take months to become clear to the patient.\r\n\r\nNow let us consider the following kind of machine as an aid to the\r\nphysician. We might call this kind of machine a _psychological\r\ntrainer_, for in many ways it is like the training machines used in\r\nWorld War II for training a pilot to fly an airplane. The psychological\r\ntrainer would have the following properties:\r\n\r\n    1. The machine is able to show sound movies—produce\r\n        pictures and utter words.\r\n\r\n    2. It is able to put before the patient: situations,\r\n        problems, questions, experiences, etc.\r\n\r\n    3. It is able to take in responses from the patient.\r\n\r\n    4. It is able to receive a program of instructions\r\n        from the physician.\r\n\r\n    5. Depending on the responses of the patient and on\r\n        the program from the physician, the training\r\n        machine can select more material to put before the\r\n        patient.\r\n\r\n    6. The training machine produces a record of what it\r\n        presented and of how the patient responded, so that\r\n        the physician and the patient can study the record\r\n        later.\r\n\r\nWhat sort of films would the machine hold? The machine could be loaded\r\nwith a number of films which would help in the particular type of\r\nneurosis from which the patient was suffering.\r\n\r\nWhat sort of responses could the patient make? The patient might have\r\nbuttons in front of him which he could press to indicate such answers\r\nas:\r\n\r\n    Yes       I don’t know      Repeat\r\n    No        It depends        Go ahead\r\n\r\nAlso, the patient might hold a device—like a lie detector,\r\nperhaps—which would report his state of tenseness, etc., and so report\r\nwhat he really felt.\r\n\r\nWhere would the machine’s questions come from? From one or more\r\nphysicians very clever in the treatment of mental illness.\r\n\r\nSuppose that the patient is inconsistent in his answers? The machine,\r\ndiscovering the inconsistencies, could return to the subject and ask\r\nrelated questions in a different way. As soon as several questions\r\nrelated to the same point are answered consistently, the machine could\r\nexclude groups of questions that no longer apply and could proceed to\r\nother questions that would still apply.\r\n\r\nPatients would vary in their ability to go as fast as the machine\r\ncould. So from time to time the machine would ask questions to test\r\nthe effect of what it had presented; and, depending on the answers,\r\nthe machine would go faster or would bring in additional material to\r\nclarify some point.\r\n\r\nThis machine might have a few advantages over ordinary treatment. For\r\nexample, with the machine, treatment does not depend on the physician’s\r\nmaking the right answer in a split second, as it may in a personal\r\ninterview. Also, the patient might be franker with the machine than\r\nwith the physician, for it might be arranged that the patient could\r\nreview his record, and then decide whether to confess it to his\r\nphysician.\r\n\r\nSuch a machine would enable physicians to treat many more patients\r\nthan they now can. In fact, it is estimated that nearly 50 per cent of\r\npersons who consult physicians are suffering only from mental illness.\r\nSuch a machine would therefore be a great help.\r\n\r\n\r\nProblems of Business\r\n\r\nAnother large group of problems for which we can foresee the use of\r\nmachines that think is found in business and economics.\r\n\r\nFor example, consider production scheduling in a business or a factory.\r\nThe machine takes in a description of each order received by the\r\nbusiness and a description of its relative urgency. The machine knows\r\n(that is, has in its memory) how much of each kind of raw material is\r\nneeded to fill the order and what equipment and manpower are needed\r\nto produce it. The machine makes a schedule showing what particular\r\nmen and what particular equipment are to be set to work to produce the\r\norder. The machine turns out the best possible production schedule,\r\nshowing who should do what when, so that all the orders will be filled\r\nin the best sequence. What is the “best” sequence? We can decide what\r\nwe think is the best sequence, and we can set the machine for making\r\nthat kind of selection, in the same way as we decide what is “warm” and\r\nset the thermostat to produce it!\r\n\r\nOn a much larger scale, we can use mechanical brains to study economic\r\nrelations in a society. Everything produced in a society is made by\r\nconsuming some materials, labor, equipment, and skill. The output\r\nproduced by one man or factory or industry becomes the input for\r\nother men, factories, industries. In this way all economic units are\r\nlinked together by many different kinds and degrees of dependence. The\r\nsituation is, of course, complicated: it changes as time goes on and\r\nas people want different things produced. Economists have already set\r\nup simple models of economic societies and have studied them. But with\r\nmachines that think, it will be possible to set up and study far more\r\ncomplicated models—models that are very much like the society we live\r\nin. We can then answer questions of economics by calculation instead of\r\nby arguments and counting noses. We shall be able to solve definitely\r\nsuch problems as: “How will a rise in the price of steel affect the\r\nfarming industry?” “How much money must be paid out as wages and\r\nsalaries so that consumer purchasing power will buy back what industry\r\nproduces?”\r\n\r\n\r\nMachines and the Individual\r\n\r\nWhat about the ordinary everyday effects of these machines upon you\r\nand me as an individual? We can see that the new machinery will apply\r\non a small scale even to us. Small machines using a few electronic\r\ntubes—much like a radio set, for example—and containing spools of\r\nmagnetic wire or magnetic tape will doubtless be available to us. We\r\nshall be able to use them to keep addresses and telephone numbers, to\r\nfigure out the income tax we should pay, to help us keep accounts and\r\nmake ends meet, to remember many things we need to know, and perhaps\r\neven to give us more information. For there are a great many things\r\nthat all of us could do much better if we could only apply what the\r\nwisest of us knows.\r\n\r\nWe can even imagine what new machinery for handling information may\r\nsome day become: a small pocket instrument that we carry around with\r\nus, talking to it whenever we need to, and either storing information\r\nin it or receiving information from it. Thus the brain with a motor\r\nwill guide and advise the man just as the armor with a motor carries\r\nand protects him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 12\r\n\r\nSOCIAL CONTROL:\r\n\r\nMACHINES THAT THINK AND HOW SOCIETY MAY CONTROL THEM\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is often easier for men to create a device than to guide it well\r\nafterwards: it is often easier for a scientist to study his science\r\nthan to study the results for good or evil that his discoveries may\r\nlead to. But it is not right nor proper for a scientist, a man who is\r\nloyal to truth as an ideal, to have no regard for what his discoveries\r\nmay lead to.\r\n\r\nThis principle is now being widely recognized. Many scientists\r\ntoday—both as individuals and as groups, and especially the atomic\r\nscientists—are considering the results of their scientific discoveries;\r\nand they are sharing in the effort to render those results truly useful\r\nto humanity.\r\n\r\nIt would be easy to leave out of this book any discussion of how\r\nmachines that think may be controlled, any consideration of how they\r\nmay be made truly useful to humanity. But that would be hardly right\r\nor proper. In concluding a book such as this one, that touches on many\r\naspects of machines that think, we need to consider what can and should\r\nbe done to make such machines of true benefit to all of humanity.\r\n\r\nSo, we come to the most important of all our questions: What sort of\r\ncontrol over machines that think do we need in human society?\r\n\r\n\r\nMACHINE THAT BOTH THINKS AND ACTS\r\n\r\nFrom a narrow point of view, a machine that only thinks produces\r\nonly information. It takes in information in one state, and it puts\r\nout information in another state. From this viewpoint, information\r\nin itself is harmless; it is just an arrangement of marks; and\r\naccordingly, a machine that thinks is harmless, and no control is\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nAlthough it is true that the information produced only becomes good or\r\nevil after other machinery or human beings act on the information, in\r\nreality a machine with the power to produce information is constructed\r\nonly for the reason of its use. We want to know what such machines can\r\ntell us only because we can then proceed to act much more efficiently\r\nthan before. For example, a guided missile needs a mechanical brain\r\nonly because then it can reach its target. In all cases mechanical\r\nbrains are inseparable from their uses.\r\n\r\nFor the purposes of this chapter, the narrow view will be rejected\r\nbecause it dodges the issue. We shall be much concerned with the\r\ncombination of a machine that thinks with another machine that acts;\r\nand we shall often call this combination the _robot machine_.\r\n\r\n\r\nREADING THIS CHAPTER\r\n\r\nNow, before launching further into the discussion, we need to say\r\nthat the conclusions suggested in this chapter are not final. Even\r\nif they are expressed a little positively in places, they are\r\nnevertheless subject to change as more information is discovered and\r\nas the appraisal of information changes with time. Also, almost any\r\nconclusions about social control—including, certainly, the conclusions\r\nin this chapter—are subject to controversy. But controversy is good:\r\nit leads to thought. The more minds that go to work on solving the\r\nproblem of social control over robot machines and other products of\r\nthe new technology—which is rushing upon us from the discoveries of\r\nthe scientists—the better off we all will be. If, while stimulating\r\ndisagreement, the ideas expressed in this chapter should succeed in\r\nstimulating thought and deliberation, the purpose of this chapter will\r\nbe well fulfilled.\r\n\r\nUp to this point in this book, the emphasis has been on possibilities\r\nof benefits to humanity that may arise from machines that think. In\r\nthis chapter, devoted as it is to the subject of control, the emphasis\r\nis on possibilities for harm. Both possibilities are valid, and the\r\nhappening of either depends upon the actions of men. In much the same\r\nway, atomic energy is a great possibility for benefit and for harm. It\r\nis the nature of control to put a fence around danger; and so it is\r\nnatural in this chapter that the weight of attention should shift to\r\nthe dangerous aspects of machines that think.\r\n\r\nPerhaps a reader may feel that a chapter of this kind is rather out of\r\nplace in a book, such as this one, that seeks to be scientific. If so,\r\nhe is reminded that, in accordance with the general suggestions for\r\nreading this book stated in the preface, he should omit this chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANKENSTEIN\r\n\r\nPerhaps the first study of the consequences of a machine that thinks is\r\na prophetic novel called _Frankenstein_, written more than a hundred\r\nyears ago, in 1818. The author, then only 21 years old, was Mary W.\r\nGodwin, who became the wife of the poet Percy Bysshe Shelley.\r\n\r\nAccording to the story, a young Swiss, an ardent student of physiology\r\nand chemistry, Victor Frankenstein, finds the secret of life. He makes\r\nan extremely ugly, clever, and powerful monster, with human desires.\r\nFrankenstein promptly flees from his laboratory and handiwork. The\r\nmonster, after seeking under great hardships for a year or two to earn\r\nfair treatment among men, finds himself continually attacked and harmed\r\non account of his ugliness, and he becomes embittered. He begins to\r\nsearch for his creator for either revenge or a bargain. When they meet:\r\n\r\n    “I expected this reception,” said the daemon.\r\n\r\n    “All men hate the wretched; how then must I be hated\r\n    who am miserable beyond all living things! Yet you my\r\n    creator detest and spurn me, thy creature, to whom thou\r\n    art bound by ties only dissoluble by the annihilation\r\n    of one of us. You purpose to kill me. How dare you\r\n    sport thus with life? Do your duty towards me, and I\r\n    will do mine towards you and the rest of mankind. If\r\n    you will comply with my conditions, I will leave them\r\n    and you at peace; but if you refuse, I will glut the\r\n    maw of death, until it be satiated with the blood of\r\n    your remaining friends.”\r\n\r\nFrankenstein starts to comply with the main condition, which is to\r\nmake a mate for the monster; but Frankenstein cannot bring himself\r\nto do it. So the monster causes the death one after another of all\r\nFrankenstein’s family and closest friends; and the tale finally ends\r\nwith the death of Frankenstein and the disappearance of the monster.\r\n\r\nAs the dictionary says about Frankenstein, “The name has become a\r\nsynonym for one destroyed by his own works.”\r\n\r\n\r\nROSSUM’S UNIVERSAL ROBOTS\r\n\r\nPerhaps the next study of the consequences of a machine that thinks\r\nis a remarkable play called _R.U.R._ (for Rossum’s Universal Robots),\r\nfirst produced in Prague in 1921. Karel Čapek, the Czech dramatist who\r\nwrote it, was then only 31. The word “robot” comes from the Czech word\r\n“robota,” meaning compulsory service.\r\n\r\nAccording to the play, Rossum the elder, a scientist, discovered a\r\n“method of organizing living matter” that was “more simple, flexible,\r\nand rapid” than the method used by nature. Rossum the younger, an\r\nengineer, founded a factory for the mass production of artificial\r\nworkmen, robots. They had the form of human beings, intelligence,\r\nmemory, and strength; but they were without feelings.\r\n\r\nIn the first act, the factory under Harry Domin, General Manager, is\r\nbusy supplying robots to purchasers all over the world—for work, for\r\nfighting, for any purpose at all, to anyone who could pay for them.\r\nDomin declares:\r\n\r\n    “... in ten years, Rossum’s Universal Robots will\r\n    produce so much corn, so much cloth, so much everything\r\n    that things will be practically without price. There\r\n    will be no poverty. All work will be done by living\r\n    machines. Everybody will be free from worry and\r\n    liberated from the degradation of labor. Everybody will\r\n    live only to perfect himself.... It’s bound to happen.”\r\n\r\nIn the second act, ten years later, it turns out that Domin and the\r\nothers in charge of the factory have been making some robots with\r\nadditional human characteristics, such as the capacity to feel pain.\r\nThe newer types of robots, however, have united all the robots against\r\nman, for the robots declare that they are “more highly developed than\r\nman, stronger, and more intelligent, and man is their parasite.”\r\n\r\nIn the last act, the robots conquer and slay all men except one—an\r\narchitect, Alquist, who in the epilogue provides a final quirk to the\r\nplot.\r\n\r\n\r\nFACT AND FANCY\r\n\r\nNow what is fact and what is fancy in these two warnings given to us a\r\nhundred years apart?\r\n\r\nOf course, it is very doubtful that a Frankenstein monster or a Rossum\r\nrobot will soon be constructed with nerves, flesh, and blood like an\r\nanimal body. But we know that many types of robot machines can even now\r\nbe constructed out of hardware—wheels, motors, wires, electronic tubes,\r\netc. They can handle many kinds of information and are able to perform\r\nmany kinds of actions, and they are stronger and swifter than man.\r\n\r\nOf course, it is doubtful that the robot machines, by themselves and\r\nof their own “free will,” will be dangerous to human beings. But as\r\nsoon as antisocial human beings have access to the controls over robot\r\nmachines, the danger to society becomes great. We want to escape that\r\ndanger.\r\n\r\n\r\nEscape from Danger\r\n\r\nA natural longing of many of us is to escape to an earlier, simpler\r\nlife on this earth. Victor Frankenstein longed to undo the past. He\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n    “Learn from me, if not by my precepts, at least by my\r\n    example, how dangerous is the acquirement of knowledge,\r\n    and how much happier that man is who believes his\r\n    native town to be the world, than he who aspires to\r\n    become greater than his nature will allow.”\r\n\r\nAny sort of return to the past is, of course, impossible. It is\r\ndoubtful that men could, even if they wanted to, stop the great flood\r\nof technical knowledge that science is now producing. We all must\r\nnow face the fact that the kind of world we used to live in, even so\r\nrecently as 1939, is gone. There now exist weapons and machines so\r\npowerful and dangerous in the wrong hands that in a day or two most of\r\nthe people of the earth could be put to death. Giant brains are closely\r\nrelated to at least two of these weapons: scientists have already used\r\nmechanical brains for solving problems about atomic explosives and\r\nguided missiles. In addition, thinking mechanisms designed for the\r\nautomatic control of gunfire were an important part of the winning of\r\nWorld War II. They will be a still more important part of the fighting\r\nof any future war.\r\n\r\nNor can we escape to another part of the earth which the new weapons\r\nwill not reach. At 300 miles an hour, any spot on earth can be reached\r\nfrom any other in less than 48 hours. A modern plane exceeds this\r\nspeed; a rocket or guided missile doubles or trebles it.\r\n\r\nNor can we trust that some kind of good luck will pull us through and\r\nhelp men to escape the consequences of what men do. Both Frankenstein\r\nand Domin reaped in full the consequences of what they did. The history\r\nof life on this earth that is recorded in the rocks is full of evidence\r\nof races of living things that have populated the earth for a time\r\nand then become extinct, such as the dinosaurs. In that long history,\r\nrarely does a race survive. In our own day, insects and fungi rather\r\nthan men have shown fitness to survive and spread over the earth:\r\nwitness the blight that destroyed the chestnut trees of North America,\r\nin spite of the best efforts of scientists to stop it.\r\n\r\nThere seems to be no kind of escape possible. It is necessary to\r\ngrapple with the problem: How can we be safe against the threat of\r\nphysical harm from robot machines?\r\n\r\n\r\nUNEMPLOYMENT\r\n\r\nThe other chief threat from robot machines is against our economic\r\nlife. Harry Domin, in _R.U.R._, you remember, prophesied: “All work\r\nwill be done by living machines.” As an example, in the magazine\r\n_Modern Industry_ for Feb. 15, 1947, appeared a picture of a machine\r\nfor selling books, and under the picture were the words:\r\n\r\n    _Another new product in robot salesmen_—Latest in\r\n    the parade of mechanical vending machines is this book\r\n    salesman.... It is designed for use in hospitals, rail\r\n    terminals, and stores. It offers 15 different titles,\r\n    selected manually, and obtained by dropping quarter in\r\n    slot. Cabinet stores 96 books.\r\n\r\nCan you feel the breath of the robot salesman, workman, engineer,—--,\r\non the back of your neck?\r\n\r\nAt the moment when we combine automatic producing machinery and\r\nautomatic controlling machinery, we get a vast saving in labor and\r\na great increase in technological unemployment. In extreme cases,\r\nperhaps, the effect of robot machines will be the disappearance of men\r\nfrom a factory. Such a factory will be like a modern power plant that\r\nturns a waterfall into electricity: once the machinery is installed,\r\nonly one watchman is ordinarily needed. But, in most cases, this will\r\nbe the effect: in a great number of factories, mines, farms, etc., the\r\nlabor force needed will be cut by a great proportion. The effect is not\r\ndifferent in quality, because the new development is robot machinery;\r\nbut the amount of technological unemployment coming from robot machines\r\nis likely to be considerably greater than previously.\r\n\r\nThe robot machine raises the two questions that hang like swords over\r\na great many of us these days. The first one is for any employee: What\r\nshall I do when a robot machine renders worthless all the skill I have\r\nspent years in developing? The second question is for any businessman:\r\nHow shall I sell what I make if half the people to whom I sell lose\r\ntheir jobs to robot machines?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOCIAL CONTROL AND ITS TWO SIDES\r\n\r\nThe two chief harmful effects upon humanity which are to be expected\r\nfrom robot machines are physical danger and unemployment. These are\r\nserious risks, and some degree of social control is needed to guard\r\nagainst them.\r\n\r\nThere will also be very great advantages from robot machines. The\r\nmonster in _Frankenstein_ is right when he says, “Do your duty towards\r\nme, and I will do mine towards you and the rest of mankind.” And Harry\r\nDomin in _R.U.R._ is right as to possibility when he says, “There will\r\nbe no poverty.... Everybody will be free from worry.” Social control\r\nmust also be concerned with how the advantages from robot machines are\r\nto be shared.\r\n\r\nThe problem of social control over men and their devices has always had\r\ntwo sides. The first side deals with what we might plan for control\r\nif men were reasonable and tolerant. This part of the problem seems\r\nrelatively easy. The other side deals with what we must ordinarily\r\narrange, since most men are often unreasonable and prejudiced and, as a\r\nresult, often act in antisocial ways. This part of the problem is hard.\r\nLet us begin with the easier side first.\r\n\r\n\r\nTYPES OF CONTROL—IF MEN WERE REASONABLE\r\n\r\nIn seeking to fulfill wants and achieve safety, men have used hundreds\r\nof types of control. The main types are usually called political and\r\neconomic systems, but there are always great quantities of exceptions.\r\nThe more mature and freer the society, the greater the variety of types\r\nof control that can be found in it.\r\n\r\nProbably the most widely used type of control in this country is\r\nprivate and public control working together, as private ownership\r\nand public regulation—for example, railroads, banks, airlines, life\r\ninsurance companies, telephone systems, and many others. It would be\r\nreasonable to expect private ownership and public regulation of a\r\ngreat many classes of robot machines, to the end that they would never\r\nthreaten the safety of people.\r\n\r\nAnother common type of control is public ownership and operation;\r\nexamples are toll bridges, airports, city transit systems, and\r\nwater-supply systems. Atomic energy was so clearly fraught with\r\nserious implications that in 1946 the Congress of the United States\r\nplaced it entirely under public control expressed as the Atomic\r\nEnergy Commission. There is a class of robot machinery which has\r\nalready reached the stage of acute public concern: guided missiles and\r\nautomatic fire-control. It would be reasonable that in this country\r\nall activity in this subdivision should be under close control by the\r\nDepartment of Defense.\r\n\r\nIn the international arena, again, the problem becomes soluble if\r\nwe assume men to be reasonable. An international agency, such as an\r\norgan of the United Nations, would take over inspection and control of\r\nrobot machine activities closely affecting the public safety anywhere\r\nin the world. Particularly, this agency would concern itself with\r\nguided missiles, robot pilots for planes, automatic gunfire control,\r\netc. Much manufacturing skill is needed to make such products as\r\nthese: the factories where they could be manufactured would thereby\r\nbe determined. Also, a giant brain is a useful device for solving\r\nscientific problems about weapons of mass destruction. So the agency\r\nwould need to inspect the problems being solved on such machines. This\r\nagency would be responsible to a legislature or an executive body\r\nrepresenting all the people in the world—if men were reasonable.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the effects of robot machines on unemployment, again,\r\nif men were reasonable, the problem would be soluble. The problem is\r\nequivalent to the problem of abundance: how should men distribute the\r\nadvantages of a vast increase in production among all the members of\r\nsociety in a fair and sensible way? A vast increase in production is\r\nnot so impossible as it may seem. For example, in 1939, with 45 million\r\nemployed, the United States index of industrial production was at 109,\r\nand, in 1943, with 52½ million employed, the index of production was at\r\n239.\r\n\r\nIf men were reasonable, the net profits from robot machinery would\r\nbe divided among (1) those who had most to do with devising the new\r\nmachinery, and (2) all of society. A rule would be adopted (probably\r\nit could be less complicated than some existing tax rules) which would\r\ntake into account various factors such as rewards to the inventors,\r\nincentives to continue inventing, adequate assistance to those made\r\nunemployed by the robot machines, reduction of prices to benefit\r\nconsumers, and contributions to basic and applied scientific research.\r\n\r\nIn fact, under the assumption “if men were reasonable,” it would hardly\r\nbe necessary to devote a chapter to the problem of social control over\r\nrobot machines!\r\n\r\n\r\nOBSTACLES\r\n\r\nThe discussion above of how robot machines could be controlled\r\nsupposing that men were reasonable, seems, of course, to be glaringly\r\nimpractical. Men are not reasonable on most occasions most of the time.\r\nIf we stopped at this point, again we would be dodging the issue. What\r\nare the obstacles to reasonable control?\r\n\r\nThere are, it seems, two big obstacles and one smaller one to\r\nreasonable types of social control over robot machines. The smaller\r\none is ignorance, and the two big obstacles are prejudice and a narrow\r\npoint of view.\r\n\r\n\r\nIgnorance\r\n\r\nBy ignorance we mean lack of knowledge and information. Now mechanical\r\nbrains are a new and intricate subject. A great many people will,\r\nthrough no fault of their own, naturally remain uninformed about\r\nmechanical brains and robot machines for a long time. However, there is\r\na widespread thirst for knowledge these days: witness in magazines, for\r\nexample, the growth of the article and the decline of the essay. There\r\nis also a fairly steady surge of knowledge from the austere scientific\r\nfountain of new technology. We can thus see both a demand and a supply\r\nfor information in such fields as mechanical brains and robot machines.\r\nWe can expect, therefore, a fairly steady decline in ignorance.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrejudice\r\n\r\nPrejudice is a much more serious obstacle to reasonable control over\r\nrobot machines. It will be worth our while to examine it at length.\r\n\r\nPrejudice is frequent in human affairs. For example, in some countries,\r\nbut not in all, there is conflict among men, based on their religious\r\ndifferences. Again, in other countries, but not in all, there is\r\nwide discrimination among men, based on the color of their skin.\r\nOver the whole world today, there is a sharp lack of understanding\r\nbetween conservatives, grading over to reactionaries, on the one\r\nhand, and liberals, grading over to radicals, on the other hand. All\r\nthese differences are based on men’s attitudes, on strongly held\r\nsets of beliefs. These attitudes are not affected by “information”;\r\nthe “information” is not believed. The attitudes are not subject to\r\n“judgment”; they come “before judgment”: they are prejudices. Even\r\nin the midst of all the science of today, prejudice is widespread.\r\nIn Germany, from 1933 to 1939, we saw one of the most scientific of\r\ncountries become one of the most prejudiced.\r\n\r\nPrejudice is often difficult to detect. We find it hard to recognize\r\neven in ourselves. For a prejudice always seems, to the person who\r\nhas it, the most natural attitude in the world. As we listen to other\r\npeople, we are often uncertain how to separate information, guesses,\r\nhumor, prejudice, etc. Circumstances compel us to accept provisionally\r\nquantities of statements just on other people’s say-so. A good test\r\nof a statement for prejudice, however, is to compare it with the\r\nscientific view.\r\n\r\nPrejudice is most dangerous for society. Its more extreme\r\nmanifestations are aggressive war, intolerance (especially of strange\r\npeople and customs), violence, race hatred, etc. In the consuming\r\nhatred that a prejudiced man has towards the object of his prejudice,\r\nhe is likely to destroy himself and destroy many more people besides.\r\nIn former days, the handy weapon was a sword or a pistol; not too much\r\ndamage could be done when one man ran amuck. But nowadays a single use\r\nof a single weapon has slain 70,000 people (the atom bomb dropped at\r\nHiroshima), and so a great many people live anxious and afraid.\r\n\r\nWhat is prejudice? How does it arise? How can it be cured, and thus\r\nremoved from obstructing reasonable control over robot machines and the\r\nrest of today’s amazing scientific developments?\r\n\r\nPrejudice is a disease of men’s minds. It is infectious. The cause and\r\ndevelopment of the disease are about as follows: Deprive someone of\r\nsomething he deeply needs, such as affection, food, or opportunity.\r\nIn this way hurt him, make him resentful, hostile; but prevent him\r\nfrom expressing his resentments in a reasonable way, giving him\r\ninstead false outlets, such as other people to hurt, myths to believe,\r\nhostile behavior patterns to imitate. He will then break out with\r\nprejudices as if they were measles. The process of curing the disease\r\nof prejudice is about as follows: Make friends with the patient; win\r\nhis trust. Encourage him to pour out his half-forgotten hates. Help him\r\nto talk them over freely, by means of questions but not criticisms,\r\nuntil finally the patient achieves insight, sees through his former\r\nprejudices, and drops them.\r\n\r\nIn these days prejudice is a cardinal problem of society. It is\r\nperhaps conservative to say that a chief present requirement for the\r\nsurvival of human society—with the atom bomb, bacterial warfare, guided\r\nmissiles, etc., near at hand—is cure of prejudice and its consequences,\r\nirrational and unrestrained hate.\r\n\r\n\r\nNarrow Point of View\r\n\r\nA narrow point of view regarding what is desirable or good is the third\r\nobstacle to rational control over robot machines. What do we mean by\r\nthis?\r\n\r\nOur point of view as a two-year-old is based on pure self-interest.\r\nIf we see a toy, we grab it. There is no prejudice about this; it is\r\nentirely natural—for two-year-olds. As we grow older, our point of\r\nview concerning what is good or desirable rapidly broadens: we think\r\nof others and their advantage besides our own. For example, we may\r\nbecome interested in a conservation program to conserve birds, or soil,\r\nor forests, and our point of view expands, embraces these objectives,\r\nwhich become part of our personality and loyalties.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, it seems to be true that the expanding point of view,\r\nthe expanding loyalties, of most people as they grow up are arrested\r\nsomewhere along the line of: self, family, neighborhood, community,\r\nsection of country, nation. An honorable exception is the scientists’\r\nold and fine tradition of world-wide unity and loyalty in the search\r\nfor objective truth.\r\n\r\nNow the problem of rational control over robot machines and other\r\nparts of the new technology is no respecter of national boundaries. To\r\nbe solved it requires a world-wide point of view, a loyalty to human\r\nsociety and its best interests, a social point of view.\r\n\r\nAlmost all that you and I have and do and think is the result of a long\r\nhistory of human society on this earth. All men on the earth today are\r\ndescendants of other men who lived 1000, 2000, 3000 ... years ago,\r\nwhether they were Romans or Chinese or Babylonians or Mayas or members\r\nof any other race. To ride in a subway or an airplane, to talk on the\r\ntelephone, to speak a language, to calculate, to survive smallpox or\r\nthe black death, etc.—all these privileges are our inheritance from\r\ncountless thousands of other human beings, of many countries, and\r\nnearly all of whom are now dead. During our lives we pass on to our own\r\nchildren an inheritance in which our own contribution is remarkably\r\nsmall. Since each person is the child of two others, the number of\r\nour forefathers is huge, and we are all undoubtedly blood cousins.\r\nBecause of this relationship, and because we owe to the rest of\r\nsociety nearly all that we are, we have a social responsibility—we need\r\nto hold a social point of view. Each of us needs to accept and welcome\r\na world-wide social responsibility, as a member of human society, as\r\na beneficiary and trustee of our human inheritance. Otherwise we are\r\ndrones, part of the hive without earning our keep. The social point of\r\nview is equitable, it is inspiring, and it is probably required now in\r\norder for human beings to survive. We need to let go of a narrow point\r\nof view.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nWe have now outlined the problem of social control over robot machines,\r\nsupposing that human beings were reasonable. We have also discussed the\r\npractical obstacles that obstruct reasonable control.\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to think of any yet organized group of people anywhere\r\nthat would have both the strength and the vision needed to solve this\r\nproblem through its own efforts. For example, a part of the United\r\nNations might have some of the vision needed, but it does not have the\r\npower. Consequently, it is necessary and desirable for individuals\r\nand groups everywhere to take upon themselves an added load of social\r\nresponsibility—just as they tend to do in time of war. People often\r\n“want to do their share.” Through encouragement and education, the\r\nbasic attitude of a number of people can contain more of “This is our\r\nbusiness; we have a responsibility for helping to solve this problem.”\r\nWe also need public responsibility; we need a public body responsible\r\nfor study, education, advice, and some measure of control. It might\r\nbe something like an Atomic Energy Commission, Bacterial Defense\r\nCommission, Mental Health Commission, and Robot Machine Commission, all\r\nrolled into one.\r\n\r\nWhen, at last, there is an effective guarantee of the two elements\r\nphysical safety and adequate employment, then at last we shall all\r\nbe free from the threat of the robot machine. We can then welcome\r\nthe robot machine as our deliverer from the long hard chores of many\r\ncenturies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSupplement 1\r\n\r\nWORDS AND IDEAS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this book is to explain machines that think, without\r\nusing technical words any more than necessary. This supplement is a\r\ndigression. Its purposes are to consider how to explain in this way and\r\nto discuss the attempt made in this book to achieve simple explanation.\r\n\r\n\r\nWORDS AS INSTRUMENTS FOR EXPLAINING\r\n\r\nWords are the chief instruments we use for explaining. Of course, many\r\nother devices—pictures, numbers, charts, models, etc.—are also used;\r\nbut words are the prime tools. We do most of our explaining with them.\r\n\r\nWords, however, are not very good instruments. Like a stone arrow-head,\r\na word is a clumsy weapon. In the first place, words mean different\r\nthings on different occasions. The word “line,” for example, has more\r\nthan fifty meanings listed in a big dictionary. How do we handle the\r\npuzzle of many meanings? As we grow older we gather experience and we\r\ndevelop a truly marvelous capacity to listen to a sentence and then\r\nfit the words together into a pattern that makes sense. Sometimes we\r\nnotice the time lag while our brain hunts for the meaning of a word we\r\nhave heard but not grasped. Then suddenly we guess the needed meaning,\r\nwhereupon we grasp the meaning of the sentence as a whole in much the\r\nsame way as the parts of a puzzle click into place when solved.\r\n\r\nAnother trouble with words is that often there is no good way to tell\r\nsomeone what a word means. Of course, if the word denotes a physical\r\nobject, we can show several examples of the object and utter the word\r\neach time. In fact, several good illustrations of a word denoting a\r\nphysical thing often tell most of its meaning. But the rest of its\r\nmeaning we often do not learn for years, if ever. For instance, two\r\npeople would more likely disagree than agree about what should be\r\ncalled a “rock” and what should be called a “stone,” if we showed them\r\ntwo dozen examples.\r\n\r\nIn the case of words not denoting physical objects, like “and,” “heat,”\r\n“responsibility,” we are worse off. We cannot show something and say,\r\n“That is a ···.” The usual dictionary is of some help, but it has a\r\ntendency to tell us what some word _A_ means by using another word _B_,\r\nand when we look up the other word _B_ we find the word _A_ given as\r\nits meaning. Mainly, however, to determine the meanings of words, we\r\ngather experience: we soak up words in our brains and slowly establish\r\ntheir meanings. We seem to use an unconscious reasoning process: we\r\nnotice how words are used together in patterns, and we conclude what\r\nthey must mean. Clearly, then, words being clumsy instruments, the\r\nmore experience we have had with a word, the more likely we are to be\r\nable to use it, work with it, and understand it. Therefore explanation\r\nshould be based chiefly on words with which we have had the most\r\nexperience. What words are these? They will be the well-known words. A\r\ngreat many of them will be short.\r\n\r\n\r\nSET OF WORDS FOR EXPLAINING\r\n\r\nNow what is the set of all the words needed to explain simply a\r\ntechnical subject like machines that think? For we shall need more\r\nwords than just the well-known and short ones. This question doubtless\r\nhas many answers; but the answer used in this book was based on the\r\nfollowing reasoning. In a book devoted to explanation, there will be\r\na group of words (1) that are supposed to be known already or to be\r\nlearned while reading, and (2) that are used as building blocks in\r\nlater explanation and definitions. Suppose that we call these words the\r\n_words for explaining._ There are at least three groups of such words:\r\n\r\n    _Group 1._ Words not specially defined that are so\r\n        familiar that every reader will know all of them;\r\n        for example, “is,” “much,” “tell.”\r\n\r\n    _Group 2._ Words not specially defined that are\r\n        familiar, but perhaps some reader may not know some\r\n        of them; for example, “alternative,” “continuous,”\r\n        “indicator.”\r\n\r\n    _Group 3._ Words that are not familiar, that many\r\n        readers are not expected to know, and that are\r\n        specially defined and explained in the body of the\r\n        book; for example, “abacus,” “trajectory,” “torque.”\r\n\r\nIn writing this book, it was not hard to keep track of the words in the\r\nthird group. These words are now listed in the index, together with\r\nthe page where they are defined or explained. (The index, of course,\r\nalso lists phrases that are specially defined.)\r\n\r\nBut what division should be made between the other two groups? A\r\npractical, easy, and conservative way to separate most words between\r\nthe first and second groups seemed to be on the basis of number of\r\nsyllables. All words of one syllable—if not specially defined—were put\r\nin Group 1. Also, if a word became two syllables only because of the\r\naddition of one of the endings “-es,” “-ed,” “-ing,” it was kept in\r\nGroup 1, for these endings probably do not make a word any harder to\r\nunderstand. In addition, there were put into Group 1:\r\n\r\n    1. Numbers; for example, “186,000”; “³/₁₀”.\r\n\r\n    2. Places: “Philadelphia”; “Massachusetts”.\r\n\r\n    3. Nations, organizations, people, etc.: “Swedish”; “Bell”.\r\n\r\n    4. Years and dates: “February”; “1946”.\r\n\r\n    5. Names of current books or articles and their authors.\r\n\r\nOf course, not all these words would be familiar to every reader (for\r\nexample, “Maya”), but in the way they occur, they are usually not\r\npuzzling, for we can tell from the context just about what they must\r\nmean.\r\n\r\nAll remaining words for explaining—chiefly, words of two or more\r\nsyllables and not specially defined—were put in Group 2 and were\r\nlisted during the writing of this book. Many Group 2 words, of course,\r\nwould be entirely familiar to every reader; but the list had several\r\nvirtues. No hard words would suddenly be sprung like a trap. The\r\nsame word would be used for the same idea. Every word of two or more\r\nsyllables was continually checked: is it needed? can it be replaced by\r\na shorter word? It is perhaps remarkable that there were fewer than\r\n1800 different words allowed to stay in this list. This fact should be\r\na comfort to a reader, as it was to the author.\r\n\r\nNow there are more words in this book than _words for explaining_. So\r\nwe shall do well to recognize:\r\n\r\n    _Group 4._ Words that do not need to be known or learned\r\n       and that are not used in later explanation and definitions.\r\n\r\nThese words occur in the book in such a way that understanding them,\r\nthough helpful, is not essential. One subdivision of Group 4 are names\r\nthat appear just once in the book, as a kind of side remark, for\r\nexample, “a chemical, called _acetylcholine_.” Such a name will also\r\nappear in the index, but it is not a _word for explaining_. Another\r\nsubdivision of Group 4 are words occurring only in quotations. For\r\nexample, in the quotation from _Frankenstein_ on page 198, a dozen\r\nwords appear that occur nowhere else in the book, including “daemon,”\r\n“dissoluble,” “maw,” “satiate.” Clearly we would destroy the entire\r\nflavor of the quotation if we changed any of these words in any way.\r\nBut only the general drift of the quotation is needed for understanding\r\nthe book, and so these words are Group 4 words.\r\n\r\nIn this way the effort to achieve simple explanation in this book\r\nproceeded. But even supposing that we could reach the best set of words\r\nfor explaining, there is more to be done. How do we go from simple\r\nexplanation to understanding?\r\n\r\n\r\nUNDERSTANDING IDEAS\r\n\r\n_Understanding_ an idea is basically a standard process. First, we\r\nfind the name of the idea, a word or phrase that identifies it. Then,\r\nwe collect true statements about the idea. Finally, we practice using\r\nthem. The more true statements we have gathered, and the more practice\r\nwe have had in applying them, the more we understand the idea.\r\n\r\nFor example, do you understand zero? Here are some true statements\r\nabout zero.\r\n\r\n    1. Zero is a number.\r\n    2. It is the number that counts none or nothing.\r\n    3. It is marked 0 in our usual numeral writing.\r\n    4. The ancient Romans, however, had no numeral for it.\r\n        Apparently, they did not think of zero as a number.\r\n    5. 0 is what you get when you take away 17 from 17, or\r\n        when you subtract any number from itself.\r\n    6. If you add 0 to 23, you get 23; and if you add 0 to\r\n        any number, you get that number unchanged.\r\n    7. If you subtract 0 from 48, you get 48; and if you\r\n        subtract 0 from any number, you get that number\r\n        unchanged.\r\n    8. If you multiply 0 by 71, you get 0; and if you\r\n        multiply together 0 and any number, you get 0.\r\n    9. Usually you are not allowed to divide by 0: that is\r\n        against the rules of arithmetic.\r\n    10. But if you do, and if you divide 12 by 0, for\r\n        example—and there are times when this is not\r\n        wrong—the result is called _infinity_ and is\r\n        marked ∞, a sign that is like an 8 on its side.\r\n\r\nThis is not all the story of zero; it is one of the most important of\r\nnumbers. But, if you know these statements about zero, and have had\r\nsome practice in applying them, you have a good _understanding_ of\r\nzero. Incidentally, a mechanical brain knows all these statements about\r\nzero and a few more; they must be built into it.\r\n\r\nFor us to understand any idea, then, we pursue three aims:\r\n\r\n    1. We find out what it is called.\r\n    2. We collect true statements about it.\r\n    3. We apply those statements—we use them in situations.\r\n\r\nWe can do this about any idea. Therefore, we can understand any idea,\r\nand the degree of our understanding increases as the number of true\r\nstatements mastered increases.\r\n\r\nPerhaps this seems to be a rash claim. Of course, it may take a good\r\ndeal of time to collect true statements about many ideas. In fact, a\r\nscientist may spend thirty years of his life trying to find out from\r\nexperiment the truth or falsehood of one statement, though, when he has\r\nsucceeded, the fact can be swiftly told to others. Also, we all vary in\r\nthe speed, perseverance, skill, etc., with which we can collect true\r\nstatements and apply them. Besides, some of us have not been taught\r\nwell and have little faith in our ability to carry out this process:\r\nthis is the greatest obstacle of all. But, there is in reality no idea\r\nin the field of existing science and knowledge which you or I cannot\r\nunderstand. The road to understanding lies clear before us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSupplement 2\r\n\r\nMATHEMATICS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the course of our discussion of machines that think, we have had to\r\nrefer without much explanation to a number of mathematical ideas. The\r\npurpose of this supplement is to explain a few of these ideas a little\r\nmore carefully than seemed easy to do in the text and, at the end of\r\nthe supplement, to put down briefly some additional notes for reference.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEVICES FOR MULTIPLICATION\r\n\r\nSuppose that we have to multiply 372 by 465. With the ordinary school\r\nmethod, we write 465 under the 372 and proceed about as follows: 5\r\ntimes 2 is 10, put down the 0 and carry the 1; 5 times 7 is 35, 35 and\r\n1 is 36, put down the 6 and carry the 3; 5 times 3 is 15, 15 and 3 is\r\n18, put down the 8 and carry the 1; ... The method is based mainly on a\r\nwell-learned subroutine of continually changing steps:\r\n\r\n    1. Select a multiplicand digit.\r\n    2. Select a multiplier digit.\r\n    3. Refer to the multiplication table with these digits.\r\n    4. Obtain the value of their product, called a _partial product_.\r\n    5. Add the preceding carry.\r\n    6. Set down the right-hand digit.\r\n    7. Carry the left-hand digit.\r\n\r\nWe can, however, simplify this subroutine for a machine by delaying the\r\ncarrying. We collect in one place all the right-hand digits of partial\r\nproducts, collect in another place all the left-hand digits, and delay\r\nall addition until the end.\r\n\r\nFor example, let us multiply 372 by 465 with this method:\r\n\r\n\r\n    RIGHT-HAND      LEFT-HAND       USUAL METHOD,\r\n      DIGITS          DIGITS       FOR COMPARISON\r\n\r\n        372             372               372\r\n      × 465           × 465             × 465\r\n     ——————          ——————            ——————\r\n        550            131               1860\r\n       822            141               2232\r\n      288            120               1488\r\n      —————          —————             ——————\r\n      37570          13541             172980\r\n\r\n            FINAL ADDITION\r\n\r\n                   37570\r\n                + 13541\r\n                ————————\r\n                  172980\r\n\r\n\r\n37570 is called the _right-hand component_ of the product. It is\r\nconvenient to fill in with 0 the space at the end of 13541 and to call\r\n135410 the _left-hand component_ of the product.\r\n\r\nThis process is called _multiplying by right- and left-hand components_.\r\nIt has the great advantage that no carrying is necessary to complete\r\nany line of the original multiplications. Some computing machines\r\nuse this process. Built into the hardware of the machine is a\r\nmultiplication table up to 9 × 9. The machine, therefore, can find\r\nautomatically the right-hand digit and the left-hand digit of any\r\npartial product. In a computing machine that uses this process, all\r\nthe left-hand digits are automatically added in one register, and\r\nall the right-hand digits are added in another register. The only\r\ncarrying that is needed is the carrying as the right-hand digits are\r\naccumulated and as the left-hand digits are accumulated. At the end of\r\nthe multiplication, one of the registers is automatically added into\r\nthe other, giving the product.\r\n\r\nAnother device used in computing machines for multiplying is to change\r\nthe multiplier into a set of digits 0 to 5 that are either positive or\r\nnegative. For example, suppose that we want to multiply 897 by 182. We\r\nnote that 182 equals 200 minus 20 plus 2, and so we can write it as\r\n\r\n     _\r\n    222.\r\n\r\nThe minus over the 2 marks it as a _negative digit_ 2. Then to multiply\r\nwe have:\r\n\r\n        897\r\n         _\r\n        222\r\n       ————\r\n       1794\r\n    - 1794\r\n     1794\r\n     ——————\r\n     163254\r\n\r\nThe middle 1794 is subtracted. This process is usually called\r\n_short-cut multiplication_. Everybody discovers this trick when he\r\ndecides that multiplying by 99 is too much work, that it is easier to\r\nmultiply by 100 and subtract once.\r\n\r\n\r\nBINARY OR TWO NUMBERS\r\n\r\nWe are well accustomed to decimal notation in which we use 10 decimal\r\ndigits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and write them in combinations\r\nto designate decimal numbers. In _binary notation_ we use two binary\r\ndigits 0, 1 and write them in combinations to designate _binary\r\nnumbers_. For example, the first 17 numbers, from 0 to 16 in the\r\ndecimal notation, correspond with the following numbers in binary\r\nnotation:\r\n\r\n    DECIMAL   BINARY     DECIMAL  BINARY\r\n       0           0\r\n       1           1        9      1001\r\n       2          10       10      1010\r\n       3          11       11      1011\r\n       4         100       12      1100\r\n       5         101       13      1101\r\n       6         110       14      1110\r\n       7         111       15      1111\r\n       8        1000       16     10000\r\n\r\nIn decimal notation, 101 means one times a hundred, no tens, and one.\r\nIn binary notation, 101 means one times four, no twos, and one. The\r\nsuccessive digits in a decimal number from right to left count 1, 10,\r\n100, 1000, 10000, ...—successive _powers_ of 10 (for this term, see the\r\nend of this supplement). The successive digits in a binary number from\r\nright to left count 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ...—powers of 2.\r\n\r\nThe decimal notation is convenient when equipment for computing has ten\r\npositions, like the fingers of a man, or the positions of a counter\r\nwheel. The binary notation is convenient when equipment for computing\r\nhas just two positions, like “yes” or “no,” or current flowing or no\r\ncurrent flowing.\r\n\r\nAddition, subtraction, multiplication, and division can all be carried\r\nout unusually simply in binary notation. The addition table is simple\r\nand consists only of four entries.\r\n\r\n    +   0   1\r\n      +——————\r\n    0 | 0   1\r\n      |\r\n    1 | 1  10\r\n\r\nThe multiplication table is also simple and contains only four entries.\r\n\r\n    ×   0  1\r\n      +——————\r\n    0 | 0  0\r\n      |\r\n    1 | 0  1\r\n\r\nSuppose that we add in binary notation 101 and 1001:\r\n\r\n    BINARY ADDITION   CHECK\r\n\r\n           101          5\r\n        + 1001          9\r\n        ——————         ———\r\n          1110         14\r\n\r\nWe proceed: 1 and 1 is 10; write down 0 and carry 1; 0 and 0 is 0, and\r\n1 to carry is 1; and 1 and 0 is 1; and then we just copy the last 1. To\r\ncheck this we can convert to decimal and see that 101 is 5, 1001 is 9,\r\nand 1110 is 14, and we can verify that 5 and 9 is 14.\r\n\r\nOne of the easiest ways to subtract in binary notation is to add a\r\n_ones complement_ (that is, the analogue of the nines complement)\r\nand use end-around-carry (for these two terms, see the end of this\r\nsupplement). A ones complement can be written down at sight by just\r\nputting 1 for 0 and 0 for 1. For example, suppose that we subtract 101\r\nfrom 1110:\r\n\r\n                          SUBTRACTION BY\r\n      DIRECT               ADDING ONES\r\n    SUBTRACTION   CHECK     COMPLEMENT\r\n\r\n        1110        14          1110\r\n       - 101        -5        + 1010\r\n       —————       ————       ——————\r\n        1001         9       (1)1000\r\n                              ↓\r\n                               ⎯→  1\r\n                              ——————\r\n                                1001\r\n\r\nMultiplication in the binary notation is simple. It amounts to (1)\r\nadding if the multiplier digit is 1 and not adding if the multiplier\r\ndigit is 0, and (2) moving over or shifting. For example, let us\r\nmultiply 111 by 101:\r\n\r\n    BINARY MULTIPLICATION   CHECK\r\n\r\n              111              7\r\n            × 101            × 5\r\n            ——————\r\n              111\r\n            111\r\n           ——————            ———\r\n           100011             35\r\n\r\nThe digit 1 in the 6th (or _n_th) _binary_ place from the right in\r\n100011 stands for 1 times 2 to the 5th (or _n_-1 th) power, 2 × 2 × 2\r\n× 2 × 2 = 32. The result 100011 is translated into 32 plus 2 plus 1,\r\nwhich equals 35 and verifies.\r\n\r\nDivision in the binary notation is also simple. It amounts to (1)\r\nsubtracting (yielding a quotient digit 1) or not subtracting (yielding\r\na quotient digit 0), and (2) shifting. We never need to try multiples\r\nof the divisor to find the largest that can be subtracted yet leave a\r\npositive remainder. For example, let us divide 1010 (10 in decimal)\r\ninto 10001110 (142 in decimal):\r\n\r\n             1110 (14 in decimal)\r\n        ——————————\r\n    1010)10001110\r\n          1010\r\n         ——————\r\n           1111\r\n           1010\r\n           —————\r\n            1011\r\n            1010\r\n            —————\r\n               10 (remainder, 2 in decimal)\r\n\r\nIn decimal notation, digits to the right of the decimal point count\r\npowers of ⅒. In binary notation, digits to the right of the _binary\r\npoint_ count powers of ½: ½, ¼, ⅛, ¹/₁₆.... For example, 0.1011 equals\r\n½ + ⅛ + ¹/₁₆, or ¹¹/₁₆.\r\n\r\nIf we were accustomed to using binary numbers, all our arithmetic\r\nwould be very simple. Furthermore, binary numbers are in many ways\r\nmuch better for calculating machinery than any other numbers. The main\r\nproblem is converting numbers from decimal notation to binary. One\r\nmethod depends on storing the powers of 2 in decimal notation. The rule\r\nis: subtract successively smaller powers of 2; start with the largest\r\nthat can be subtracted, and count 1 for each power that goes and 0 for\r\neach power that does not. For example, 86 in decimal becomes 1010110 in\r\nbinary:\r\n\r\n    86\r\n    64   64 goes         1\r\n    ———\r\n    22   32 does not go  0\r\n    16   16 goes         1\r\n    ———\r\n     6    8 does not go  0\r\n     4    4 goes         1\r\n    ———\r\n     2    2 goes         1\r\n     2    1 does not go  0\r\n    ———\r\n     0\r\n\r\nIt is a little troublesome to remember long series of 1’s and 0’s; in\r\nfact, to write any number in binary notation takes about 3⅓ times as\r\nmuch space as decimal notation. For this reason we can separate binary\r\nnumbers into triples beginning at the right and label each triple as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    TRIPLE   LABEL\r\n     000       0\r\n     001       1\r\n     010       2\r\n     011       3\r\n     100       4\r\n     101       5\r\n     110       6\r\n     111       7\r\n\r\nFor example, 1010110 would become 1 010 110 or 126. This notation is\r\noften called _octal notation_, because it is notation in the scale of\r\neight.\r\n\r\n\r\nBIQUINARY OR _TWO-FIVE_ NUMBERS\r\n\r\nAnother kind of notation for numbers is _biquinary notation_, so called\r\nbecause it uses both 2’s and 5’s. Essentially this notation is very\r\nlike Roman numerals, ancient style. By ancient style we mean, for\r\nexample, VIIII instead of IX. In the following table we show the first\r\ntwo dozen numbers in decimal, biquinary, and ancient Roman notation:\r\n\r\n    DECIMAL   BIQUINARY   ROMAN\r\n       0           0\r\n       1           1      I\r\n       2           2      II\r\n       3           3      III\r\n       4           4      IIII\r\n       5          10      V\r\n       6          11      VI\r\n       7          12      VII\r\n       8          13      VIII\r\n       9          14      VIIII\r\n      10         100      X\r\n      11         101      XI\r\n      12         102      XII\r\n      13         103      XIII\r\n      14         104      XIIII\r\n      15         110      XV\r\n      16         111      XVI\r\n      17         112      XVII\r\n      18         113      XVIII\r\n      19         114      XVIIII\r\n      20         200      XX\r\n      21         201      XXI\r\n      22         202      XXII\r\n      23         203      XXIII\r\n\r\nThe biquinary columns alternate in going from 0 to 4 and from 0 to 1.\r\nThe digits from 0 to 4 are not changed. The digits from 5 to 9 are\r\nchanged into 10 to 14. We see that the _biquinary digits_ are 0 to 4 in\r\nodd columns and 0, 1 in even columns, counting from the right.\r\n\r\nThis is the notation actually expressed by the _abacus_. The beads of\r\nthe abacus show by their positions groups of 2 and 5 (see Fig. 1).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1. Abacus and notations.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME OPERATIONS OF ALGEBRA\r\n\r\nOne of the operations of algebra that is important for a mechanical\r\nbrain is _approximation_, the problem of getting close to the right\r\nvalue of a number. Take, for example, finding _square root_ (see the\r\nend of this supplement). The ordinary process taught in school is\r\nrather troublesome. We can set down another process, however, using a\r\ndesk calculator to do division, which gives us square root with great\r\nspeed.\r\n\r\nSuppose that we want to find the square root of a number _N_, and\r\nsuppose that we have _x_₀ as a guessed square root correct to one\r\nfigure. For example, _N_ might be 67.2 and _x_₀ might be 8, chosen\r\nbecause 8 × 8 is 64, and 9 × 9 is 81, and it seems as if 8 should be\r\nnear the square root of 67.2. Here is the process:\r\n\r\n    1. Divide _x_₀ into _N_, and obtain _N_/_x_₀.\r\n\r\n    2. Multiply _x_₀ + _N_/_x_₀ by 0.5 and call the result _x_₁.\r\n\r\nNow repeat:\r\n\r\n    1. Divide _x_₁ into _N_ and obtain _N_/_x_₁.\r\n\r\n    2. Multiply _x_₁ + _N_/_x_₁ by 0.5 and call the result _x_₂.\r\n\r\nEvery time this process is repeated, the new _x_ comes a great deal\r\ncloser to the correct square root. In fact it can be shown that, if\r\n_x_₀ is correct to one figure, then:\r\n\r\n    APPROXIMATION   IS CORRECT TO ··· FIGURES\r\n       _x_₁                  2\r\n       _x_₂                  4\r\n       _x_₃                  8\r\n       _x_₄                 16\r\n\r\nLet us see how this actually works out with 67.2 and a 10-column desk\r\ncalculator.\r\n\r\n    Round 1: 8 divided into 67.2 gives 8.4. One half of 8\r\n      plus 8.4 is 8.2. This is _x_₁.\r\n\r\n    Round 2: 8.2 divided into 67.2 gives 8.195122. One half\r\n      of 8.2 plus 8.195122 is 8.197561. This is _x_₂.\r\n\r\n    Round 3: 8.197561 divided into 67.2 gives 8.197560225.\r\n      One half of 8.197561 and 8.197560225 is 8.1975606125.\r\n      This is _x_₃.\r\n\r\n    Checking _x_₃, we find that 8.1975606125 divided\r\n      into 67.2 gives 8.1975606126 approximately.\r\n\r\nIn this case, then, _x_₃ is correct to more than 10 figures. In other\r\nwords, with a reasonable guess and two or three divisions we can\r\nobtain all the accuracy we can ordinarily use. This process is called\r\n_rapid approximation_, or _rapidly convergent approximation_, since it\r\n_converges_ (points or comes together) very quickly to the number we\r\nare seeking.\r\n\r\nAnother important operation of algebra is _interpolation_, the problem\r\nof putting values smoothly in between other values. For example,\r\nsuppose that we have the table:\r\n\r\n    _x        y_\r\n      5      26\r\n      6      37\r\n      7      50\r\n      8      65\r\n      9      82\r\n\r\nSuppose that we want to find the value that _y_ (or _yₓ_) ought to have\r\nwhen _x_ has the value of 7.2. This is the problem of _interpolating y_\r\nso as to find _y_ at the value of 7.2, _y_₇ˌ₂.\r\n\r\nOne way of doing this is to discover the formula that expresses _y_ and\r\nthen to put _x_ into that formula. This is not always easy. Another\r\nway is to take the difference between _y_₇ and _y_₈, 15, and share\r\nthe difference appropriately over the distance 7 to 7.2 and 7.2 to 8.\r\nWe can, for example, take ²/₁₀ of 15 = 3, add that to _y_₇ = 50, and\r\nobtain an estimated _y_₇ˌ₂ = 53. This is called _linear interpolation_,\r\nsince the difference 0.2 in the value of _x_ is used only to the first\r\npower. It is a good practical way to carry out most interpolation\r\nquickly and approximately.\r\n\r\nActually here _y_ = _x_² + 1, and so the true value of _y_₇ˌ₂ is (7.2 ×\r\n7.2) + 1, or 52.84, which is rather close to 53. Types of interpolation\r\nprocedures more accurate than linear interpolation will come much\r\nnearer still to the true value.\r\n\r\n\r\nALGEBRA OF LOGIC\r\n\r\nWe turn now to the _algebra of logic_. The first half of Chapter\r\n9, “Reasoning” (through the section “Logical-Truth Calculation by\r\nAlgebra”), introduces this subject. There the terms _truth values_,\r\n_truth tables_, _logical connectives_, and _algebra of logic_ are\r\nexplained. The part of Chapter 3, “A Machine That Will Think,” that\r\ndiscusses the operations _greater-than_ and _selection_, also explains\r\nsome of the algebra of logic. It introduces, for example, the formula\r\n\r\n    _p_ = _T_(_a_ > _b_) = 1, 0\r\n\r\nThis is a way of saying briefly that the truth value of the statement\r\n“_a_ is greater than _b_” equals _p_; _p_ is 1 if the statement is true\r\nand 0 if the statement is false. The truth value 1 corresponds with\r\n“yes.” The truth value 0 corresponds with “no.”\r\n\r\nWith mechanical brains we are especially interested in handling\r\nmathematics and logic without any sharp dividing line between them.\r\nFor example, suppose that we have a register in which a ten-digit\r\nnumber like 1,765,438,890 may be stored. We should be able to use\r\nthat register to store a number consisting of only 1’s and 0’s, like\r\n1,100,100,010. Such a number may designate the answers to 10 successive\r\nquestions: yes, yes, no, no, yes, no, no, no, yes, no. Or it may\r\ntell 10 successive binary digits. The register then is three times\r\nas useful: it can store either decimal numbers or truth values or\r\nbinary digits. We need, of course, a way to obtain from the register\r\nany desired digit. For this purpose we may have two instructions to\r\nthe machine: (1) read the left-hand end digit; (2) shift the number\r\naround in a circle. The second instruction is the same as multiplying\r\nby 10 and then putting the left-most digit at the right-hand end.\r\nFor example, suppose that we want the 3rd digit from the left in\r\n1,100,100,010. The result of the first circular shift is 1,001,000,101;\r\nthe result of the second circular shift is 0,010,001,011; and reading\r\nthe left-most digit gives 0. A process like this has been called\r\n_extraction_ and is being built into the newest mechanical brains.\r\n\r\nUsing truth values, we can put down very neatly some truths of ordinary\r\nalgebra. For example:\r\n\r\n    (the _absolute value_ of _a_) =\r\n        _a_ × (the truth of _a_ greater than or equal to 0)\r\n      - _a_ × (the truth of _a_ less than 0)\r\n\r\n    ⎮_a_⎮ = _a_ · _T_(_a_ ≥ 0) - _a_ · _T_(_a_ < 0)\r\n\r\nFor another example:\r\n\r\n    Either _a_ is greater than _b_,\r\n      or else _a_ equals _b_,\r\n      or else _a_ is less than _b_\r\n\r\n    _T_(_a_ > _b_) + _T_(_a_ = _b_) + _T_(_a_ < _b_) = 1\r\n\r\nMany common logical operations, like selecting and comparing, and\r\nthe behavior of many simple mechanisms, like a light or a lock, can\r\nbe expressed by truth values. Chapter 4, on punch-card mechanisms,\r\ncontains a number of examples.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\npronoun, variable\r\n\r\nIn ordinary language, a _pronoun_, like “he,” “she,” “it,” “the\r\nformer,” “the latter,” is a word that usually stands for a noun\r\npreviously referred to. A pronoun usually stands for the last preceding\r\nnoun that the grammar allows. In mathematics, a _variable_, like “_a_,”\r\n“_b_,” “_x_,” “_m₁_,” “_m₂_” closely resembles a pronoun in ordinary\r\nlanguage. A variable is a symbol that usually stands for a number\r\npreviously referred to, and usually it stands for the same number\r\nthroughout a particular discussion.\r\n\r\n\r\nmultiplicand, dividend, augend, etc.\r\n\r\n       IN THE           THE NAME       THE NAME    THE NAME\r\n      EQUATION:        OF _a_ IS:     OF _b_ IS:   OF _c_ IS:\r\n\r\n    _a_ + _b_ = _c_    augend         addend       sum\r\n    _a_ - _b_ = _c_    minuend        subtrahend   remainder\r\n    _a_ × _b_ = _c_    multiplicand   multiplier   product\r\n    _a_ ÷ _b_ = _c_    dividend       divisor      quotient\r\n\r\n\r\n_Augend_ and _addend_ are names of registers in the Harvard Mark II\r\ncalculator (see Chapter 10).\r\n\r\n\r\nsubtraction by adding, nines complement\r\n\r\nTwo digits that add to 9 (0 and 9, 1 and 8, 2 and 7, 3 and 6, 4 and 5)\r\nare called _nines complements_ of each other. The _nines complement_ of\r\na number _a_ is the number _b_ in which each digit of _b_ is the nines\r\ncomplement of the corresponding digit of _a_; for example, the nines\r\ncomplement of 173 is 826. Ordinary subtraction is the same as addition\r\nas of the nines complement, with a simple correction; for example, 562\r\nless 173 (equal to 389) is the same as 562 plus 826 (equal to 1388)\r\nless 1000 plus 1.\r\n\r\n\r\nend-around-carry\r\n\r\nThe correction “less 1000 plus 1” of the foregoing example may be\r\nthought of as carrying the 1 (in the result 1388) around from the\r\nleft-hand end to the right-hand end, where it is there added. So the 1\r\nis called _end-around-carry_.\r\n\r\n\r\ntens complement\r\n\r\nTwo digits that add to 10 are called _tens complements_ of each other.\r\nThe _tens complement_ of a number _a_, however, is equal to the nines\r\ncomplement of the number plus 1. For example, the tens complement of\r\n173 is 827. When subtracting by adding a tens complement, the left-most\r\ndigit 1 in the result is dropped. For example, 562 less 173 (equal to\r\n389) is the same as 562 plus 827 (equal to 1389) less 1000.\r\n\r\n\r\npower, square, cube, reciprocal, etc.\r\n\r\nA _power_ of any number _a_ is _a_ multiplied by itself some number\r\nof times. _a_ × _a_ × _a_ ... × _a_ where _a_ appears _b_ times is\r\nwritten _a_ᵇ and is read _a_ to the _b_th power. _a_², a to the 2nd\r\npower, is _a_ × _a_ and is called _a squared_ or the _square_ of _a_.\r\n_a_³, _a_ to the 3rd power, _a_ × _a_ × _a_, is called _a cubed_, or\r\nthe _cube_ of _a_. _a_⁰, _a_ to the zero power, is equal to 1 for every\r\n_a_. _a_¹, _a_ to the power 1, is _a_ itself. The first power is often\r\ncalled _linear_. _a_ to some negative power is the same as 1 divided\r\nby that power; that is, _a_⁻ᵇ = 1/_a_ᵇ. _a_⁻¹, _a_ to the power minus\r\n1, is 1/_a_, and is called the _reciprocal_ of _a_. _a_¹ᐟ², _a_ to\r\nthe one-half power, is a number _c_ such that _c_ × _c_ = _a_, and is\r\ncalled the _square root_ of _a_ and often denoted by √_a_.\r\n\r\n\r\ntable, tabular value, argument, etc.\r\n\r\nAn example of a _table_ is:\r\n\r\n        0.025     0.03\r\n      +——————————————————\r\n    1 | 1.02500   1.03000\r\n      |\r\n    2 | 1.05063   1.06090\r\n      |\r\n    3 | 1.07689   1.09273\r\n\r\nThe numbers in the body of the table, called _tabular values_, depend\r\non or are determined by the numbers along the edge of the table, called\r\n_arguments_. In this example, if 1, 2, 3 are choices of a number _n_,\r\nand if 0.025, 0.03 are choices of a number _i_, then each tabular value\r\n_y_ is equal to 1 plus _i_ raised to the _n_th power. _n_ and _i_ are\r\nalso called _independent variables_, and _y_ is called the _dependent\r\nvariable_. The table expresses a _function_ or _formula_ or _rule_. The\r\nrule could be stated as: add _i_ to 1; raise the result to the _n_th\r\npower.\r\n\r\n\r\nconstant\r\n\r\nA number is said to be a _constant_ if it has the same value under\r\nall conditions. For example, in the formula: (area of a circle) = π ×\r\n(radius)², π is a constant, equal to 3.14159 ..., applying equally well\r\nto all circles.\r\n\r\n\r\ninfinity\r\n\r\nMathematics recognizes several kinds of infinity. One of them occurs\r\nwhen numbers become very large. For example, the quotient of 12 divided\r\nby a number _x_, as _x_ becomes closer and closer to 0, becomes\r\nindefinitely large, and the limit is called _infinity_ and is denoted ∞.\r\n\r\n\r\nequation, simultaneous, linear\r\n\r\nAn example of two linear simultaneous _equations_ is:\r\n\r\n    7_x_ + 8_t_ = 22\r\n\r\n    3_x_ + 5_t_ = 11\r\n\r\n_x_ and _t_ are called _unknowns_—that is, unknown variables—because\r\nthe objective of solving the equations is to find them. These equations\r\nare called _simultaneous_ because they are to be solved together,\r\nat the same time, for values of _x_ and _t_ which will fit in both\r\nequations. The equations are called _linear_ because the only powers\r\nof the unknowns that appear are the first power. Values that solve\r\nequations are said to _satisfy_ them. It is easy to solve these two\r\nequations and find that _x_ = 2 and _t_ = 1 is their solution. But\r\nit is a long process to solve 10 linear simultaneous equations in 10\r\nunknowns, and it is almost impossible (without using a mechanical\r\nbrain) to solve 100 linear simultaneous equations in 100 unknowns.\r\n\r\n\r\nderivative, integral, differential equation, etc.\r\n\r\nSee the sections in Chapter 5 entitled “Differential Equations,”\r\n“Physical Problems,” and “Solving Physical Problems.” There these\r\nideas and, to some extent, also the following ideas were explained:\r\nformula, equation, function, differential function, instantaneous rate\r\nof change, interval, inverse, integrating. See also a textbook on\r\ncalculus. If _y_ is a function of _x_, then a mathematical symbol for\r\nthe derivative of _y_ with respect to _x_ is _Dₓ y_, and a symbol for\r\nthe integral of _y_ with respect to _x_, is ∫_y dx_. An integral with\r\ngiven initial conditions (see p. 83) is a _definite integral_.\r\n\r\n\r\nexponential\r\n\r\nA famous mathematical function is the _exponential_. It equals\r\nthe constant _e_ raised to the _x_ power, _eˣ_, where _e_ equals\r\n2.71828.... The exponential lies between the powers of 2 and the powers\r\nof 3. It can be computed from:\r\n\r\n                       _x_²      _x_³\r\n    _eˣ_ = 1 + _x_ + —————— + ————————— + ...\r\n                      1 · 2   1 · 2 · 3\r\n\r\nIt is a solution of the differential equation _Dₓy_ = _y_. See also a\r\ntextbook on calculus. The _exponential to the base 10_ is 10ˣ.\r\n\r\n\r\nlogarithm\r\n\r\nAnother important mathematical function is the _logarithm_. It is\r\nwritten log _x_ or logₑ _x_ and can be computed from the two equations:\r\n\r\n    log _uv_ = log _u_ + log _v_\r\n\r\n                          _x_²     _x_³\r\n    log(1 + _x_) = _x_ - —————— + —————— - ..., _x_² < 1\r\n                           2        3\r\n\r\nIt is a solution of the differential equation _Dₓy_ = 1/_y_. If _y_\r\nis the logarithm of _x_, then _x_ is the _antilogarithm_ of _y_. The\r\n_logarithm to the base 10_ of _x_, log₁₀ _x_, equals the _logarithm to\r\nthe base e_ of _x_, logₑ _x_, divided by logₑ 10. See also textbooks on\r\nalgebra and calculus.\r\n\r\n\r\nsine, cosine, tangent, antitangent\r\n\r\nThese also are important mathematical functions. The _sine_ and\r\n_cosine_ are solutions of the differential equation _Dₓ_(_Dₓy_) =-_y_\r\nand are written as sin _x_ and cos _x_. They can be computed from\r\n\r\n                     _x_³       _x_⁵\r\n    sin _x_ = _x_ - —————— + ————————— - ...\r\n                    1·2·3    1·2·3·4·5\r\n\r\n                   _x_²      _x_₄\r\n    cos _x_ = 1 - —————— + —————— - ...\r\n                   1·2     1·2·3·4\r\n\r\nThe _tangent_ of _x_ is simply sine of _x_ divided by cosine of _x_. If\r\n_y_ is the tangent of _x_, then _x_ is the _antitangent_ of _y_. See\r\nalso references on trigonometry and on calculus. _Trigonometric_ tables\r\ninclude sine, cosine, tangent, and related functions.\r\n\r\n\r\nBessel functions\r\n\r\nThese are mathematical functions that were named after Friedrich W.\r\nBessel, a Prussian astronomer who lived from 1784 to 1846. Bessel\r\nfunctions are found as some of the solutions of the differential\r\nequation\r\n\r\n    _x_² _Dₓ_(_Dₓy_) + x _Dₓy_ + (_x_² - _n_²)_y_ = O\r\n\r\nThis equation arises in a number of physical problems in the fields of\r\nelectricity, sound, heat flow, air flow, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nmatrix\r\n\r\nA _matrix_ is a table (or _array_) of numbers in rows and columns, for\r\nwhich addition, multiplication, etc., with similar tables is specially\r\ndefined. For example, the matrix\r\n\r\n          ⎮1  2⎮\r\n          ⎮    ⎮\r\n          ⎮3  4⎮\r\n\r\n    plus the matrix\r\n\r\n          ⎮5    20⎮\r\n          ⎮       ⎮\r\n          ⎮60  100⎮\r\n\r\n    equals the matrix\r\n\r\n          ⎮6    22⎮\r\n          ⎮       ⎮\r\n          ⎮63  104⎮.\r\n\r\n(Can you guess the rule defining addition?)\r\n\r\nCalculations using matrices are useful in physics, engineering,\r\npsychology, statistics, etc. To add a _square matrix_ of 100 terms in\r\nan array of 10 columns and 10 rows to another such matrix, 100 ordinary\r\nadditions of numbers are needed. To multiply one such matrix by\r\nanother, 1000 ordinary multiplications and 900 ordinary additions are\r\nneeded. See references on matrix algebra and matrix calculus.\r\n\r\n\r\ndifferences, smoothness, checking\r\n\r\nOn p. 221, a sequence of values of _y_ is shown: 26, 37, 50, 65, 82.\r\nSuppose, however, the second value of _y_ was reported as 47 instead\r\nof 37. Then the _differences_ of _y_ as we pass down the sequence\r\nwould not be 11, 13, 15, 17 (which is certainly regular or _smooth_)\r\nbut 21, 3, 15, 17 (which is certainly not smooth). The second set of\r\ndifferences would strongly suggest a mistake in the reporting of _y_.\r\nThe _smoothness_ of differences is often a useful check on a sequence\r\nof reported values.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSupplement 3\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\r\n\r\nA book like the present one can cover only a part of the subject of\r\nmachines that think. To obtain more information about these machines\r\nand other topics to which they are related there are many references\r\nthat may be consulted. There are still few books directly on the\r\nsubject of machines that think, but there are many articles and papers,\r\nmost of them rather specialized.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this supplement is to give a number of these references\r\nand to provide a brief, general introduction to some of them. The\r\nreferences are subdivided into groups, each dealing with a branch of\r\nthe subject. The references in each group are in alphabetical order\r\nby name of author (with “anonymous” last), and under each author they\r\nare in chronological order by publication date. Some publications,\r\nespecially a forum or symposium, are listed more than once, according\r\nas the topic discussed falls in different groups. In this supplement,\r\nthe sign three dots ( ...) next to the page numbers for an article\r\nindicates that the article is continued on later, nonconsecutive pages.\r\n\r\nIt seemed undesirable to try to make the group of references dealing\r\nwith a subject absolutely complete, so long as enough were given to\r\nprovide a good introduction to the subject. It proved impractical\r\nto try to make the citation of every single reference technically\r\ncomplete, so long as enough citation was given so that the reference\r\ncould certainly be found. Furthermore, in a list of more than 250\r\nreferences, errors are almost certain to occur. If any reader should\r\nsend me additions or corrections, I shall be more than grateful.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HUMAN BRAIN\r\n\r\nNo one yet knows specifically how particular ideas are thought about\r\nin the human brain.

A group of men, many of them in and near Chicago,\r\nhave been saying: “We know the properties of nerves, nerve impulses,\r\nand simple nerve networks. We know the activity of the brain. What\r\nmathematical model of nerve networks is necessary to account for the\r\nactivity of the brain?” These men have used mathematics, statistics,\r\nand mathematical logic in the effort to attack this problem, and they\r\nsupport a _Bulletin of Mathematical Biophysics_.\r\n\r\n    HOUSEHOLDER, ALSTON S., A Neural Mechanism for\r\n        Discrimination, _Psychometrika_, vol. 4, no.\r\n        1, Dec. 1939, pp. 45-58.\r\n\r\n    HOUSEHOLDER, ALSTON S., and Herbert D.\r\n        Landahl, _Mathematical Biophysics of the Central\r\n        Nervous System_, Bloomington, Ind.: Principia\r\n        Press, 1945.\r\n\r\n    LANDAHL, HERBERT D., Contributions to the\r\n        Mathematical Biophysics of the Central Nervous\r\n        System, _Bulletin of Mathematical Biophysics_,\r\n        vol. 1, no. 2, June 1939, pp. 95-118.\r\n\r\n    LANDAHL, HERBERT D., WARREN S.\r\n        MCCULLOCH, and WALTER PITTS, A\r\n        Statistical Consequence of the Logical Calculus\r\n        of Nervous Nets, _Bulletin of Mathematical\r\n        Biophysics_, vol. 5, no. 4, Dec. 1943,\r\n        pp. 135-137.\r\n\r\n    LANDAHL, HERBERT D., A Note on the\r\n        Mathematical Biophysics of Central Excitation\r\n        and Inhibition, _Bulletin of Mathematical\r\n        Biophysics_, vol. 7, no. 4, Dec. 1945,\r\n        pp. 219-221.\r\n\r\n    LETTVIN, JEROME Y., and WALTER PITTS,\r\n        A Mathematical Theory of the Affective Psychoses,\r\n        _Bulletin of Mathematical Biophysics_, vol. 5,\r\n        no. 4, Dec. 1943, pp. 139-148.\r\n\r\n    MCCULLOCH, WARREN S., and WALTER\r\n        PITTS, A Logical Calculus of the Ideas\r\n        Immanent in Nervous Activity, _Bulletin of\r\n        Mathematical Biophysics_, vol. 5, no. 4,\r\n        Dec. 1943, pp. 115-133.\r\n\r\n    RASHEVSKY, N., _Mathematical Biophysics_,\r\n        Chicago: University of Chicago Press.

The following list of references, of course, is short; it is\r\nmeant chiefly as an introduction pointing out a number of different\r\npaths into the field of language and languages.

Colleges with scholars\r\nwho write textbooks usually have not had a variety of expensive and\r\nversatile computing machinery. As a result, the main environment for\r\nstimulating possible authors has until recently been missing.

To solve problems, this machine uses the laws governing a\r\nnetwork of electrical circuits. For example, an electric power company\r\nwith a system of power lines over hundreds of miles may have a problem\r\nabout electrical power: will an accident or a sudden demand cause a\r\nbreakdown anywhere in the system? In the General Electric Company\r\nin Schenectady, N. Y., there is a machine called the A.C. Network\r\nAnalyzer. All the properties of the power company’s network of lines\r\ncan be fed on a small scale into the analyzer. Certain dials are turned\r\nand certain plugwires are connected. Then various kinds of “accidents”\r\nand “sudden demands” are fed into the machine, and the response of the\r\nsystem is noted. The answers given by the machine are multiplied by the\r\nproper scale factor, and in this way the problem of the power company\r\nis solved.\r\n\r\nThere are two kinds of problems that network analyzers are built to\r\nsolve: the steady state conditions and the transient conditions. For\r\nexample, you may not overload a fuse with an electric iron when it is\r\nplugged in and being used, but as you pull out the cord, you may blow\r\nthe fuse: the steady state does not overstrain the system, but the\r\ntransient does.\r\n\r\nSome articles on network analyzers are:\r\n\r\n    ENNS, W.
