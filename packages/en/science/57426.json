The family was originally French\r\nHuguenot—De la Trompe—which, upon the revocation of the Edict of Nantes\r\nin 1685, took refuge in Holland, where its head assumed the name of Van\r\nder Troomp, just as many other of the French Protestants rendered their\r\nnames into Dutch. Some years later, upon the invitation of the Elector\r\nof Brandenburg, Niklas Van der Troomp became a subject of that prince,\r\nand purchased a large estate in the province of Pomerania, again\r\nchanging his name, this time to Von Troomp.\r\n\r\nThe “Little Baron,” so called from his diminutive stature, was born some\r\ntime in the latter part of the seventeenth century. He was the last of\r\nhis race in the direct line, although cousins of his are to-day\r\nwell-known Pomeranian gentry. He began his travels at an incredibly\r\nearly age, and filled his castle with such strange objects picked up\r\nhere and there in the far away corners of the world, that the\r\nsimple-minded peasantry came to look upon him as half bigwig and half\r\nmagician—hence the growth of the many myths and fanciful stories\r\nconcerning this indefatigable globe-trotter. The date of his death\r\ncannot be fixed with any certainty; but this much may be said: Among the\r\nportraits of Pomeranian notables hanging in the Rathhaus at Stettin,\r\nthere is one picturing a man of low stature, and with a head much too\r\nlarge for his body. He is dressed in some outlandish costume, and holds\r\nin his left hand a grotesque image in ivory, most elaborately carved.\r\nThe broad face is full of intelligence, and the large gray eyes are\r\nlighted up with a good-natured but quizzical look that invariably\r\nattracts attention. The man’s right hand rests upon the back of a dog\r\nsitting on a table and looking straight out with an air of dignity that\r\nshows that he knew he was sitting for his portrait.\r\n\r\nIf a visitor asks the guide who this man is, he always gets for answer:—\r\n\r\n“Oh, that’s the Little Baron!”\r\n\r\nBut little Baron who, that’s the question?\r\n\r\nWhy may it not be the famous Wilhelm Heinrich Sebastian von Troomp,\r\ncommonly called “Little Baron Trump,” and his wonderful dog Bulger?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n                                                                    PAGE\r\n\r\n BULGER IS GREATLY ANNOYED BY THE FAMILIARITY OF THE VILLAGE DOGS\r\n   AND THE PRESUMPTION OF THE HOUSE CATS.—HIS HEALTH SUFFERS\r\n   THEREBY, AND HE IMPLORES ME TO SET OUT ON MY TRAVELS AGAIN.

I\r\n\r\n  BULGER IS GREATLY ANNOYED BY THE FAMILIARITY OF THE VILLAGE DOGS AND\r\n    THE PRESUMPTION OF THE HOUSE CATS.—HIS HEALTH SUFFERS THEREBY, AND\r\n    HE IMPLORES ME TO SET OUT ON MY TRAVELS AGAIN. I READILY CONSENT,\r\n    FOR I HAD BEEN READING OF THE WORLD WITHIN A WORLD IN A MUSTY OLD\r\n    MS. WRITTEN BY THE LEARNED DON FUM.—PARTING INTERVIEWS WITH THE\r\n    ELDER BARON AND THE GRACIOUS BARONESS MY MOTHER.—PREPARATIONS FOR\r\n    DEPARTURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nBulger was not himself at all, dear friends. There was a lack-lustre\r\nlook in his eyes, and his tail responded with only a half-hearted wag\r\nwhen I spoke to him. I say half-hearted, for I always had a notion that\r\nthe other end of Bulger’s tail was fastened to his heart. His appetite,\r\ntoo, had gone down with his spirits; and he rarely did anything more\r\nthan sniff at the dainty food which I set before him, although I tried\r\nto tempt him with fried chickens’ livers and toasted cocks’ combs—two of\r\nhis favorite dishes.\r\n\r\nThere was evidently something on his mind, and yet it never occurred to\r\nme what that something was; for to be honest about it, it was something\r\nwhich of all things I never should have dreamed of finding there.\r\n\r\nPossibly I might have discovered at an earlier day what it was all\r\nabout, had it not been that just at this time I was very busy, too busy,\r\nin fact, to pay much attention to any one, even to my dear four-footed\r\nfoster brother. As you may remember, dear friends, my brain is a very\r\nactive one; and when once I become interested in a subject, Castle Trump\r\nitself might take fire and burn until the legs of my chair had become\r\ncharred before I would hear the noise and confusion, or even smell the\r\nsmoke.\r\n\r\nIt so happened at the time of Bulger’s low spirits that the elder baron\r\nhad, through the kindness of an old school friend, come into possession\r\nof a fifteenth-century manuscript from the pen of a no less celebrated\r\nthinker and philosopher than the learned Spaniard, Don Constantino\r\nBartolomeo Strepholofidgeguaneriusfum, commonly known among scholars as\r\nDon Fum, entitled “A World within a World.” In this work Don Fum\r\nadvanced the wonderful theory that there is every reason to believe that\r\nthe interior of our world is inhabited; that, as is well known, this\r\nvast earth ball is not solid, on the contrary, being in many places\r\nquite hollow; that ages and ages ago terrible disturbances had taken\r\nplace on its surface and had driven the inhabitants to seek refuge in\r\nthese vast underground chambers, so vast, in fact, as well to merit the\r\nname of “World within a World.”\r\n\r\nThis book, with its crumpled, torn, and time-stained leaves exhaling the\r\nodors of vaulted crypt and worm-eaten chest, exercised a peculiar\r\nfascination upon me. All day long, and often far into the night, I sat\r\nporing over its musty and mildewed pages, quite forgetful of this\r\nsurface world, and with the plummet of thought sounding these\r\nsubterranean depths, and with the eye and ear of fancy visiting them,\r\nand gazing upon and listening to the dwellers therein.\r\n\r\nWhile I would be thus engaged, Bulger’s favorite position was on a\r\nquaintly embroidered leather cushion brought from the Orient by me on\r\none of my journeys, and now placed on the end of my work-table nearest\r\nthe window. From this point of vantage Bulger commanded a full view of\r\nthe park and the terrace and of the drive leading up to the\r\n_porte-cochère_. Nothing escaped his watchful eye. Here he sat hour by\r\nhour, amusing himself by noting the comings and goings of all sorts of\r\nfolk, from the hawkers of gewgaws to the noblest people in the shire.\r\nOne day my attention was attracted by his suddenly leaping down from his\r\ncushion and giving a low growl of displeasure. I paid little heed to it,\r\nbut to my surprise the next day about the same hour it occurred again.\r\n\r\nMy curiosity was now thoroughly aroused; and laying down Don Fum’s musty\r\nmanuscript, I hastened to the window to learn the cause of Bulger’s\r\nirritation.\r\n\r\nLo, the secret was out! There stood half a dozen mongrel curs belonging\r\nto the tenantry of the baronial lands, looking up to the window, and by\r\ntheir barking and antics endeavoring to entice Bulger out for a romp.\r\nDear friends, need I assure you that such familiarity was extremely\r\ndistasteful to Bulger? Their impudence was just a little more than he\r\ncould stand. Ringing my bell, I directed my servant to hunt them away.\r\nWhereupon Bulger consented to resume his seat by the window.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, just as I had settled myself down for a good long\r\nread, I was almost startled by Bulger bounding into the room with eyes\r\nflashing fire and teeth laid bare in anger. Laying hold of the skirt of\r\nmy dressing-gown, he gave it quite a savage tug, which meant, “Put thy\r\nbook aside, little master, and follow me.”\r\n\r\nI did so. He led me down-stairs across the hallway and into the\r\ndining-room, and then this new cause of discontent on his part became\r\nvery apparent to me. There grouped around his silver breakfast plate sat\r\nan ancient tabby cat and four kittens, all calmly licking or lapping\r\naway at his breakfast. Looking up into my face, he uttered a sharp,\r\ncomplaining howl, as much as to say, “There, little master, look at\r\nthat. Isn’t that enough to roil the patience of a saint? Canst thou\r\nwonder that I am not happy with all these disagreeable things happening\r\nto me? I tell thee, little master, it is too much for flesh and blood to\r\nput up with.”\r\n\r\nAnd I thought so too, and did all in my power to comfort my unhappy\r\nlittle friend; but judge of my surprise upon reaching my room and\r\ndirecting him to take his place on his cushion, to see him refuse to\r\nobey.\r\n\r\nIt was something extraordinary, and set me to thinking. He noticed this\r\nand gave a joyful bark, then dashed into my sleeping apartment. He was\r\ngone for several moments, and then returned bearing in his mouth a pair\r\nof Oriental shoes which he laid at my feet. Again and again he\r\ndisappeared, coming back each time with some article of clothing in his\r\nmouth. In a few moments he had laid a complete Oriental costume on the\r\nfloor before my eyes; and would you believe me, dear friends, it was the\r\nidentical suit which I had worn on my last travels in far-away lands,\r\nwhen he and I had been wrecked on the Island of Gogulah, the land of the\r\nRound Bodies. What did it all mean? Why, this, to be sure:—\r\n\r\n“Little master, canst thou not understand thy dear Bulger? He is weary\r\nof this dull and spiritless existence. He is tired of this increasing\r\nfamiliarity on the part of these mongrel curs of the neighborhood and of\r\nthe audacity of these kitchen tabbies and their families. He implores\r\nthee to break away from this life of revery and inaction, and for the\r\nhonor of the Trumps to be up and away again.” Stooping down and winding\r\nmy arms around my dear Bulger, I cried out,—\r\n\r\n“Yes, I understand thee now, faithful companion; and I promise thee that\r\nbefore this moon has filled her horns we shall once more turn our backs\r\non Castle Trump, up and away in search of the portals to Don Fum’s World\r\nwithin a World.” Upon hearing these words, Bulger broke out into the\r\nwildest, maddest barking, bounding hither and thither as if the very\r\nspirit of mischief had suddenly nestled in his heart. In the midst of\r\nthese mad gambols a low rap on my chamber door caused me to call out,—\r\n\r\n“Peace, peace, good Bulger, some one knocks. Peace, I say.”\r\n\r\nIt was the elder baron. With sombre mien and stately tread he advanced\r\nand took a seat beside me on the canopy.\r\n\r\n“Welcome, honored father!” I exclaimed as I took his hand and raised it\r\nto my lips. “I was upon the very point of seeking thee out.”\r\n\r\nHe smiled and then said,—\r\n\r\n“Well, little baron, what thinkest thou of Don Fum’s World within a\r\nWorld?”\r\n\r\n“I think, my lord,” was my reply, “that Don Fum is right: that such a\r\nworld must exist; and with thy consent it is my intention to set out in\r\nsearch of its portals with all safe haste and as soon as my dear mother,\r\nthe gracious baroness, may be able to bring her heart to part with me.”\r\n\r\nThe elder baron was silent for a moment, and then added: “Little baron,\r\nmuch as thy mother and I shall dread to think of thy being again out\r\nfrom under the safe protection of this venerable roof, the moss-grown\r\ntiles of which have sheltered so many generations of the Trumps, yet\r\nmust we not be selfish in this matter. Heaven forbid that such a thought\r\nshould move our souls to stay thee! The honor of our family, thy fame as\r\nan explorer of strange lands in far-away corners of the globe, call unto\r\nus to be strong hearted. Therefore, my dear boy, make ready and go forth\r\nonce more in search of new marvels. The learned Don Fum’s chart will\r\nstand thee by like a safe and trusty counsellor. Remember, little baron,\r\nthe motto of the Trumps, Per Ardua ad Astra—the pathway to glory is\r\nstrewn with pitfalls and dangers—but the comforting thought shall ever\r\nbe mine, that when thy keen intelligence fails, Bulger’s unerring\r\ninstinct will be there to guide thee.”\r\n\r\nAs I stooped to kiss the elder baron’s hand, the gracious baroness\r\nentered the room.\r\n\r\nBulger hastened to raise himself upon his hind legs and lick her hand in\r\ntoken of respectful greeting. The tears were pressing hard against her\r\neyelids, but she kept them back, and encircling my neck with her loving\r\narms, she pressed many and many a kiss upon my cheeks and brow.\r\n\r\n“I know what it all means, my dear son,” she murmured with the saddest\r\nof smiles; “but it never shall be said that Gertrude Baroness von Trump\r\nstood in the way of her son adding new glories to the family ’scutcheon.\r\nGo, go, little baron, and Heaven bring thee safely back to our arms and\r\nto our hearts in its own good time.”\r\n\r\nAt these words Bulger, who had been listening to the conversation with\r\npricked-up ears and glistening eyes, gave one long howl of joy, and then\r\nspringing into my lap, covered my face with kisses. This done, he vented\r\nhis happiness in a string of earsplitting barks and a series of the\r\nmaddest gambols. It was one of the happiest and proudest days of his\r\nlife, for he felt that he had exerted considerable influence in screwing\r\nto the sticking-point my resolution to set out on my travels once again.\r\n\r\nAnd now the patter of hurrying feet and the loud murmur of anxious\r\nvoices resounded through the castle corridors, while inside and out ever\r\nand anon I could hear the cry now whispered and now outspoken,—\r\n\r\n“The little baron is making ready to leave home again.”\r\n\r\nBulger ran hither and thither, surveying everything, taking note of all\r\nthe preparations, and I could hear his joyous bark ring out as some\r\nfamiliar article used by me on my former journeys was dragged from its\r\nhiding-place.\r\n\r\nTwenty times a day my gentle mother came to my room to repeat some good\r\ncounsel or reiterate some valuable caution. It seemed to me that I had\r\nnever seen her so calm, so stately, so lovable.\r\n\r\nShe was very proud of my great name and so, in fact, were every man,\r\nwoman, and child in the castle. Had I not gotten off as I did, I should\r\nhave been literally killed with kindness and Bulger slain with\r\nsweet-cake.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER II\r\n\r\n  DON FUM’S MYSTERIOUS DIRECTIONS.—BULGER AND I SET OUT FOR\r\n    PETERSBURG, AND THENCE PROCEED TO ARCHANGEL.—THE STORY OF OUR\r\n    JOURNEY AS FAR AS ILITCH ON THE ILITCH.—IVAN THE TEAMSTER.—HOW WE\r\n    MADE OUR WAY NORTHWARD IN SEARCH OF THE PORTALS TO THE WORLD\r\n    WITHIN A WORLD.—IVAN’S THREAT.—BULGER’S DISTRUST OF THE MAN AND\r\n    OTHER THINGS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to the learned Don Fum’s manuscript, the portals to the World\r\nwithin a World were situated somewhere in Northern Russia, possibly, so\r\nhe thought, from all indications, somewhere on the westerly slope of the\r\nupper Urals. But the great thinker could not locate them with any\r\naccuracy. “The people will tell thee” was the mysterious phrase that\r\noccurred again and again on the mildewed pages of this wonderful\r\nwriting. “The people will tell thee.” Ah, but what people will be\r\nlearned enough to tell me that? was the brain-racking question which I\r\nasked myself, sleeping and waking, at sunrise, at high noon, and at\r\nsunset; at the crowing of the cock, and in the silent hours of the\r\nnight.\r\n\r\n“The people will tell thee,” said learned Don Fum.\r\n\r\n“Ah, but what people will tell me where to find the portals to the World\r\nwithin a World?”\r\n\r\nHitherto on my travels I had made choice of a semi-Oriental garb, both\r\non account of its picturesqueness and its lightness and warmth, but now\r\nas I was about to pass quite across Russia for a number of months, I\r\nresolved to don the Russian national costume; for speaking Russian\r\nfluently, as I did a score or more of languages living and dead, I would\r\nthus be enabled to come and go without everlastingly displaying my\r\npassport, or having my trains of thought constantly disturbed by\r\ninquisitive travelling companions—a very important thing to me, for my\r\nmind possessed the extraordinary power of working out automatically any\r\ntask assigned to it by me, provided it was not suddenly thrown off its\r\ntrack by some ridiculous interruption. For instance, I was upon the very\r\npoint one day of discovering perpetual motion, when the gracious\r\nbaroness suddenly opened the door and asked me whether I had pared the\r\nnails of my great toes lately, as she had observed that I had worn holes\r\nin several pairs of my best stockings.\r\n\r\nIt was about the middle of February when I set out from the Castle\r\nTrump, and I journeyed night and day in order to reach Petersburg by the\r\nfirst of March, for I knew that the government trains would leave that\r\ncity for the White Sea during the first week of that month. Bulger and I\r\nwere both in the best of health and spirits, and the fatigue of the\r\njourney didn’t tell upon us in the least. The moment I arrived at the\r\nRussian capital I applied to the emperor for permission to join one of\r\nthe government trains, which was most graciously accorded. Our route lay\r\nalmost directly to the northward for several days, at the end of which\r\ntime we reached the shores of Lake Ladoga. This we crossed on the ice\r\nwith our sledges, as a few days later we did Lake Onega. Thence by land\r\nagain, we kept on our way until Onega Bay had been reached, crossing it,\r\ntoo, on the ice, and so reaching the station of the same name, where we\r\nhalted for a day to give our horses a well-deserved rest. From this\r\npoint we proceeded in a straight line over the snow fields to Archangel,\r\nan important trading-post on the White Sea.\r\n\r\nAs this was the destination of the government train, I parted with its\r\ncommandant after a few days’ pleasant sojourn at the government house,\r\nand set out, attended only by my faithful Bulger and two servants, who\r\nhad been assigned to me by the imperial commissioner.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DEPARTURE FROM CASTLE TRUMP.]\r\n\r\nMy course now carried me up the River Dwina as far as Solvitchegodsk;\r\nthence I proceeded on my way over the frozen waters of the Witchegda\r\nRiver until we had reached the government post of Yarensk, and from here\r\non we headed due East until our hardy little horses had dragged us into\r\nthe picturesque village of Ilitch on the Ilitch. Here we were obliged to\r\nabandon our sledges, for the snows had disappeared like magic,\r\nuncovering long vistas of green fields, which in a few days the May sun\r\ndotted with flowers and sweet shrubs. At Ilitch I was obliged to\r\nrelinquish from my service the two faithful government retainers who had\r\naccompanied me from Archangel, for they had now reached the most\r\nwesterly point which they had been commissioned to visit. I had become\r\nvery much attached to them, and so had Bulger, and after their departure\r\nwe both felt as if we were now, for the first time, among strangers in a\r\nstrange land; but I succeeded in engaging, as I thought, a trustworthy\r\nteamster, Ivan by name, who made a contract with me for a goodly wage to\r\ncarry me a hundred miles farther north.\r\n\r\n“But not another step farther, little baron!” said the fellow doggedly.\r\nI was now really at the foot hills of the Northern Urals, for the rocky\r\ncrests and snow-clad peaks were in full sight.\r\n\r\nI turned many a wistful look up toward the wild regions shut in by their\r\nsheer walls and parapets, shaggy and bristling with black pines, for a\r\nlow, mysterious voice came a-whispering in my inward ear that somewhere,\r\nah, somewhere in that awful wilderness, I should one day come upon the\r\nportals of the World within a World! In spite of all I could do Bulger\r\ntook a violent dislike to Ivan and Ivan to him; and if the bargain had\r\nnot been made and the money paid over, I should have looked about me for\r\nanother teamster. And yet it would have been a foolish thing to do, for\r\nIvan had two excellent horses, as I saw at a glance, and, what’s more,\r\nhe took the best of care of them, at every post rubbing them until they\r\nwere quite dry, and never thinking of his own supper until they had been\r\nwatered and fed.\r\n\r\nHis tarantass, too, was quite new and solidly built and well furnished\r\nwith soft blankets, all in all as comfortable as you can make a wagon\r\nwhich has no other springs than the two long wooden supports that reach\r\nfrom axle to axle. True, they were somewhat elastic; but I could notice\r\nthat Bulger was not overfond of riding in this curious vehicle with its\r\nrattlety-bang gait up and down these mountain roads, and often asked\r\npermission to leap out and follow on foot.\r\n\r\nAt length Ivan reported everything in readiness for the start; and\r\nalthough I would have fain taken my departure from Ilitch on the Ilitch\r\nin as quiet a manner as possible, yet the whole village turned out to\r\nsee us off—Ivan’s family, father, mother, sisters, and brothers, wife\r\nand children, uncles and aunts and cousins by dozens alone making up\r\npeople enough to stock a small town. They cheered and waved their\r\nkerchiefs, Bulger barked, and I smiled and raised my cap with all the\r\ndignity of a Trump. And so we got away at last from Ilitch on the\r\nIlitch, Ivan on the box, and Bulger and I at the back, sitting close\r\ntogether like two brothers that we were—two breasts with but a single\r\nheart-beat and two brains busy with the same thought—that come perils or\r\ncome sudden attacks, come covert danger or bold and open-faced\r\nonslaught, we should stand together and fall together! Many and many a\r\ntime as Ivan’s horses went crawling up the long stretches of mountain\r\nroad and I lay stretched upon the broad-cushioned seat of the tarantass\r\nwith a blanket rolled up for a pillow, I would find myself unconsciously\r\nrepeating those mysterious words of Don Fum:—\r\n\r\n“The people will tell thee! The people will tell thee!”\r\n\r\nSo steep were the roads that some days we would not make more than five\r\nmiles, and on others a halt of several hours would have to be made to\r\nenable Ivan to tighten his horses’ shoes, grease the axles, or do some\r\nneedful thing in or about his wagon. It was slow work, ay, it was very\r\nslow and tedious, but what matters it how many or great the\r\ndifficulties, to a man who has made up his mind to accomplish a certain\r\ntask? Do the storks or the wild geese stop to count the thousands of\r\nmiles between them and their far-away homes when the time comes to turn\r\ntheir heads southward? Do the brown ants pause to count the hundreds of\r\nthousands of grains of sand which they must carry through their long\r\ncorridors and winding passages before they have burrowed deep enough to\r\nescape the frost of midwinter?\r\n\r\nThere had been many Trumps, but never one that had thrown up his arms\r\nand cried, “I surrender!” and should I be the first to do it? “Never!\r\nNot even if it meant never to see dear old Castle Trump again!”\r\n\r\nOne morning as we went zigzagging up a particularly nasty bit of\r\nmountain road, Ivan suddenly wheeled about and without even taking off\r\nhis hat, cried out,—\r\n\r\n“Little baron, I cover the last mile of the hundred to-day. If thou\r\nwouldst go any farther north thou must hire thee another teamster; dost\r\nhear?”\r\n\r\n“Silence!” said I sternly, for the fellow had broken in upon a very\r\nimportant train of thought.\r\n\r\nBulger, too, resented the man’s insolence, and growled and showed his\r\nteeth.\r\n\r\n“But, little baron, listen to reason,” he continued in a more respectful\r\ntone, removing his cap: “my people will expect me back. I promised my\r\nfather—I’m a dutiful son—I—”\r\n\r\n“Nay, nay, Ivan,” I interrupted sharply, “curb that tongue of thine lest\r\nit harm thy soul. Know, then, that I spoke with thy father, and he\r\npromised me that thou shouldst go a second hundred miles with me if need\r\nwere, but on condition that I give thee double pay. It shall be done,\r\nand on top of that a goodly present for your _golubtchika_ (darling).”\r\n\r\n“Little baron, thou art a hard master,” whimpered the man. “If the whim\r\ntook thee thou wouldst bid me leap into the Giants’ Well just to see\r\nwhether it has a bottom or not. St. Nicholas, save me!”\r\n\r\n“Nay, Ivan,” said I kindly, “I know no such word as cruelty although I\r\ndo confess that right seems harsh at times, but thou wert born to serve\r\nand I to command. Providence hath made thee poor and me rich. We need\r\neach other. Do thou thy duty, and thou wilt find me just and\r\nconsiderate. Disobey me, and thou wilt find that this short arm may be\r\nstretched from Ilitch to Petersburg.”\r\n\r\nIvan turned pale at this hidden threat of mine; but I deemed it\r\nnecessary to make it, for I as well as Bulger had scented treachery and\r\nrebellion about this boorish fellow, whose good trait was his love of\r\nhis horses, and it has always been my rule in life to open my eyes wide\r\nto the good that there is in a man, and close them to his faults. But,\r\nin spite of kind words and kind treatment, Ivan grew surlier and moodier\r\nthe moment we had passed the hundredth milestone.\r\n\r\nBulger watched him with a gaze so steady and thoughtful that the man\r\nfairly quailed before it. Hour by hour he became more and more restive,\r\nand upon leaving a roadside tavern, for the very first time since we had\r\nleft Ilitch on the Ilitch, I noticed that the fellow had been drinking\r\ntoo much _kwass_. He let loose his tongue, and raised his hand against\r\nhis horses, which until that moment he had been wont to load down with\r\ncaresses and pet names.\r\n\r\n“Look out for that driver of thine, little baron,” whispered the\r\ntavern-keeper. “He’s in a reckless mood. He’d not pull up if the Giants’\r\nWell were gaping in front of him. St. Nicholas have thee in his safe\r\nkeeping!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III\r\n\r\n  IVAN MORE AND MORE TROUBLESOME.—BULGER WATCHES HIM CLOSELY.—HIS\r\n    COWARDLY ATTACK UPON ME.—MY FAITHFUL BULGER TO THE RESCUE.—A\r\n    DRIVER WORTH HAVING.—HOW I WAS CARRIED TO A PLACE OF SAFETY.—IN\r\n    THE HANDS OF OLD YULIANA.—THE GIANTS’ WELL.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen we halted for the night it was only by threatening the man with\r\nsevere punishment upon my return to Ilitch that I could bring him to rub\r\nhis horses dry and feed and water them properly; but I stood over him\r\nuntil he had done his work thoroughly, for I knew that no such horses\r\ncould be had for love or money in that country, and if they should go\r\nlame from standing with wet coats in the chill night air, it might mean\r\na week’s delay.\r\n\r\nScarcely had I thrown myself on the hard mattress which the\r\ntavern-keeper called the best bed in the house, when I was aroused by\r\nloud and boisterous talking in the next room. Ivan was drinking and\r\nquarrelling with the villagers. I strode into the room with the arrows\r\nof indignation shooting from my eyes, and the faithful Bulger close at\r\nmy heels.\r\n\r\nThe moment Ivan set eyes upon us he shrank away, half in earnest and\r\nhalf in jest, and called out,—\r\n\r\n“Hey, look at the _mazuntchick_! [Little Dandy!] How smart he looks! He\r\nfrightens me! See his eyes, how they shine in the dark! Look at the\r\nlittle demon on four legs beside him! Save me, brothers! Save me—he will\r\nthrow me down into the Giants’ Well! Marianka will never see me again!\r\nNever! Save me, brothers!”\r\n\r\n“Peace, fellow,” I called out sternly. “How darest thou exercise thy\r\ndull wit on thy master? Get thee to bed at once, or I’ll have thee\r\nwhipped by the village constable for thy drunkenness.”\r\n\r\nIvan clambered up upon the top of the bake oven, and stretched himself\r\nout on a sheepskin; then turning to the tavern-keeper, I forbade him\r\nunder any pretext whatever to give my servant any more liquor to drink.\r\n“_Akh, Vasha prevoskhoditelstvo_ [Ah, your Excellency!]” exclaimed the\r\ntavern-keeper with a gesture of disgust, “the fools never know when they\r\nhave had enough. It matters not what the tavern-keeper may say to them.\r\nThey tell us not to spoil our own trade. _Akh!_ [Ah!] they don’t know\r\nwhen to stop. They have throats as deep as the ‘Giants’ Well!’”\r\n\r\n“The Giants’ Well! The Giants’ Well!” I murmured to myself, as I again\r\nthrew myself down upon the bag of hay which did service as a mattress\r\nfor those who could afford to pay for it. It’s strange how those words\r\nseem to be in every peasant’s mouth, but I thought no more about it at\r\nthat time. Sleep got the better of me, and with my usual good-night to\r\nthe elder baron and the gracious baroness, my mother, I dropped off into\r\nsweet forgetfulness.\r\n\r\nIt is a good thing that I had the power of falling asleep almost at\r\nwill, for with my restless brain ever throbbing and pulsating with its\r\nown over-abundance of strength, ever tapping at the thin panels of bone\r\nwhich covered it, like an imprisoned inventor pounding on his cell door\r\nand pleading to be let out into the daylight with his plans and schemes,\r\nI should simply have become a lunatic.\r\n\r\nAs it was, with the mere power of thought I ordered sweet slumber to\r\ncome to my rescue, and so obedient was this good angel of mine, that all\r\nI had to do was simply to set the time when I wished to awaken, and the\r\nthing was done to the very minute.\r\n\r\nAs for Bulger, I never pretended to lay down any rules for him. He made\r\nit a practice of catching forty winks when he was persuaded that no\r\ndanger of any kind threatened me, and even then, I am half inclined to\r\nbelieve that, like an anxious mother over her babe, he never quite\r\nclosed both eyes at once.\r\n\r\nThough entirely sobered by daybreak, yet Ivan went about the task of\r\nharnessing up with such an ill grace that I was obliged to reprove him\r\nseveral times before we had left the tavern yard. He was like a vicious\r\nbut cowardly animal that quails before a strong and steady eye, but\r\nwatches its opportunity to spring upon you when your back is turned.\r\n\r\nI not only called Bulger’s attention to the fellow’s actions, and warned\r\nhim to be very watchful, but I also took the precaution to examine the\r\npriming of the brace of Spanish pistols which I carried thrust into my\r\nbelt.\r\n\r\nWe had scarcely pulled out into the highway when a low growl from Bulger\r\naroused me from a fit of meditation; and this growl was followed by such\r\nan anxious whine from my four-footed brother, as he raised his speaking\r\neyes to me, that I glanced hastily from one side of the road to the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nLo and behold! the treacherous Ivan was deliberately engaged in an\r\nattempt to overturn the tarantass and to get rid of his enforced task of\r\ntransporting us any farther on our journey.\r\n\r\n“Wretch!” I cried, springing up and laying my hand on his shoulder. “I\r\nperceive very plainly what thou hast in mind, but I warn thee most\r\nsolemnly that if thou makest another attempt to overturn thy wagon, I’ll\r\nslay thee where thou sittest.”\r\n\r\nFor only answer and with a lightning-like quickness he struck a\r\nback-hand blow at me with the loaded end of his whipstock.\r\n\r\nIt took me full in the right temple, and sent me to the bottom of the\r\ntarantass like a piece of lead.\r\n\r\nFor an instant the terrible blow robbed me of my senses, but then I saw\r\nthat the cowardly villain had turned in his seat and had swung the heavy\r\nhandled whip aloft with intent to despatch me with a second and a surer\r\nblow.\r\n\r\nPoor fool! he reckoned without his host; for with a shriek of rage,\r\nBulger leaped at his throat like a stone from a catapult, and struck his\r\nteeth deep into the fellow’s flesh.\r\n\r\nHe roared with agony and attempted to shake off this unexpected foe, but\r\nin vain.\r\n\r\nBy this time I had come to a full realizing sense of the terrible danger\r\nBulger and I were both in, for Ivan had dropped his whip and was\r\nreaching for his sheath-knife.\r\n\r\nBut he never gripped it, for a well-aimed shot from one of my pistols\r\nstruck him in the forearm, for I had no wish to take the man’s life, and\r\nbroke it.\r\n\r\nThe shock and the pain so paralyzed him that he fell over against the\r\ndashboard half in a faint, and then rolled completely out of the wagon,\r\ndragging Bulger with him. The horses now began to rear and plunge. I saw\r\nno more. There was a noise as of the roar of angry waters in my ears,\r\nand then the light of life went out of my eyes entirely. I had swooned\r\ndead away.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to me hours that I lay there on my back in the bottom of the\r\ntarantass with my head hanging over the side, but of course it was only\r\nminutes. I was aroused by a prickling sensation in my left cheek, and as\r\nI slowly came to myself I discovered that it proceeded from the gravel\r\nthrown up against it by one of the front wheels of the tarantass, for\r\nthe horses were galloping along at the top of their speed, and there on\r\nthe driver’s seat sat my faithful Bulger, the reins in his teeth,\r\nbracing himself so as to keep them taut over the horses’ backs; and as I\r\nsat up and pressed my hand against my poor hurt head, the whole truth\r\nbroke upon me:—\r\n\r\nThe moment Ivan had struck the ground Bulger had released his hold upon\r\nthe fellow’s throat, and ere he had had a chance to revive had leaped up\r\ninto the driver’s seat, and, catching up the reins in his teeth, had\r\ndrawn them taut and thus put an end to the rearing and plunging of the\r\nfrightened beasts and started them on their way, leaving the enraged\r\nIvan brandishing his knife and uttering imprecations upon mine and\r\nBulger’s heads as he saw his horses and wagon disappear in the distance.\r\nNow was it that a mad shouting assailed my ears and I caught a glimpse\r\nof half a dozen peasants who, seeing this, as they thought, empty\r\ntarantass come nearer and nearer with its galloping horses, had\r\nabandoned their work and rushed out to intercept it.\r\n\r\nJudge of their amazement, dear friends, as their eyes fell upon the calm\r\nand skilful driver bracing himself on the front seat, and with oft\r\nrepeated backward tosses of his head urging those horses to bear his\r\nbeloved master farther and farther away from the treacherous Ivan’s\r\nsheath-knife.\r\n\r\nAs the peasants seized the animals by the heads and brought them to a\r\nstandstill, I staggered to my feet, and threw my arms around my dear\r\nBulger. He was more than pleased with what he had done, and licked my\r\nbruised brow with many a piteous moan.\r\n\r\n“St. Nicholas, save us!” cried one of the peasants, devoutly making the\r\nsign of the cross; “but if I should live long enough to fill the Giants’\r\nWell with pebbles, I never would expect to see the like of this again.”\r\n\r\n“The Giants’ Well, the Giants’ Well!” I murmured to myself as I followed\r\none of the peasants to his cot, standing a little back from the highway,\r\nfor I stood sore in need of rest after the terrible experience I had\r\njust had. The blow of Ivan’s whip-handle had jarred my brain, and I was\r\nskilled enough in surgery to know that the hurt called for immediate\r\nattention. As good luck would have it, I found beneath the peasant’s\r\nroof one of those old women, half witches perhaps, who have recipes for\r\neverything and who know an herb for every ailment. After she had\r\nexamined the cut made by the loaded whip-handle, she muttered out,—\r\n\r\n“It is not as broad as the mountain, nor as deep as the Giants’ Well,\r\nbut it’s bad enough, little master.”\r\n\r\n“The Giants’ Well again,” thought I, as I laid me down on the best bed\r\nthey could make up for me. “I wonder where it may be, that Giants’ Well,\r\nand how deep it is, and who drinks the water that is drawn from it?”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n  MY WOUND HEALS.—YULIANA TALKS ABOUT THE GIANTS’ WELL.—I RESOLVE TO\r\n    VISIT IT.—PREPARATIONS TO ASCEND THE MOUNTAINS.—WHAT HAPPENED TO\r\n    YULIANA AND TO ME.—REFLECTION AND THEN ACTION.—HOW I CONTRIVED TO\r\n    CONTINUE THE ASCENT WITHOUT YULIANA FOR A GUIDE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a day or so before I could walk steadily, and meantime I made\r\nunusual efforts to keep my brain quiet, but in spite of all I could do\r\nevery mention of the Giants’ Well by one of the peasants sent a strange\r\nthrill through me, and I would find myself suddenly pacing up and down\r\nthe floor, and repeating over and over again the words, “Giants’ Well!\r\nGiants’ Well!”\r\n\r\nBulger was greatly troubled in his mind, and sat watching me with a most\r\nbewildered look in his loving eyes. He had half a suspicion, I think,\r\nthat that cruel blow from Ivan’s whip-handle had injured my reasoning\r\npowers, for at times he uttered a low, plaintive whine. The moment I\r\ntook notice of him, however, and acted more like myself, he gamboled\r\nabout me in the wildest delight. As I had directed the peasants to drive\r\nIvan’s horses back towards Ilitch on the Ilitch, until they should meet\r\nthat miscreant and deliver them to him, I was now without any means of\r\ncontinuing my journey northward, unless I set out, like many of my\r\nfamous predecessors, on foot. They had longer legs than I, however, and\r\nwere not loaded with so heavy a brain in proportion to their size, and a\r\nbrain, too, that scarcely ever slept, at least not soundly. I was too\r\nimpatient to reach the portals to the World within a World to go\r\ntrudging along a dusty highway. I must have horses and another\r\ntarantass, or at least a peasant’s cart. I must push on. My head was\r\nquite healed now, and my fever gone.\r\n\r\n“Hearken, little master,” whispered Yuliana; such was the name of the\r\nold woman who had taken care of me, “thou art not what thou seemst. I\r\nnever saw the like of thee before. If thou wouldst, I believe thou\r\ncouldst tell me how high the sky is, how thick through the mountains\r\nare, and how deep the Giants’ Well is.”\r\n\r\nI smiled, and then I said,—\r\n\r\n“Didst ever drink from the Giants’ Well, Yuliana?”\r\n\r\nAt which she wagged her head and sent forth a low chuckle.\r\n\r\n“Hearken, little master,” she then whispered, coming close to me, and\r\nholding up one of her long, bony fingers, “thou canst not trick me—thou\r\nknowest that the Giants’ Well hath no bottom.”\r\n\r\n“No bottom?” I repeated breathlessly, as Don Fum’s mysterious words,\r\n“The people will tell thee!” flashed through my mind. “No bottom,\r\nYuliana?”\r\n\r\n“Not unless thine eyes are better than mine, little master,” she\r\nmurmured, nodding her head slowly.\r\n\r\n“Listen, Yuliana,” I burst out impetuously, “where is this bottomless\r\nwell? Thou shalt lead me to it; I must see it. Come, let’s start at\r\nonce. Thou shalt be well paid for thy pains.”\r\n\r\n“Nay, nay, little master, not so fast,” she replied. “It’s far up the\r\nmountains. The way is steep and rugged, the paths are narrow and\r\nwinding, a false step might mean instant death, were there not some\r\nstrong hand to save thee. Give up such a mad thought as ever getting\r\nthere, except it be on the stout shoulders of some mountaineer.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, good woman,” was my reply, “thou hast just said that I am not what\r\nI seem, and thou saidst truly. Know, then, thou seest before thee the\r\nworld-renowned traveller, Wilhelm Heinrich Sebastian von Troomp,\r\ncommonly called ‘Little Baron Trump,’ that though short of stature and\r\nfrail of limb, yet what there is of me is of iron. There, Yuliana,\r\nthere’s gold for thee; now lead the way to the Giants’ Well.”\r\n\r\n“Gently, gently, little baron,” almost whispered the old peasant woman,\r\nas her shrivelled hand closed upon the gold piece. “I have not told thee\r\nall. For leagues about, I ween, no living being excepting me knows where\r\nthe Giants’ Well is. Ask them and they’ll say, “It’s up yonder in the\r\nmountains, away up under the eaves of the sky.” That’s all. That’s all\r\nthey can tell thee. But, little master, I know where it is, and the very\r\nherb that cured thy hurt head and saved thee from certain death by\r\ncooling thy blood, was plucked by me from the brink of the well!” These\r\nwords sent a thrill of joy through me, for now I felt that I was on the\r\nright road, that the words of the great master of all masters, Don Fum,\r\nhad come true.\r\n\r\n“The people will tell thee!”\r\n\r\nAy, the people had told me, for now there was not the faintest shadow of\r\ndoubt in my mind that I had found the portals to the World within a\r\nWorld! Yuliana should be my guide. She knew how to thread her way up the\r\nnarrow pass, to turn aside from overhanging rocks which a mere touch\r\nmight topple over, to find the steps which nature had hewn in the sides\r\nof the rocky parapets, and to pursue her way safely through clefts and\r\ngorges, even the entrance to which might be invisible to ordinary eyes.\r\nHowever, in order that the superstitious peasants might be kept friendly\r\nto me, I gave it out that I was about to betake myself to the mountains\r\nin search of curiosities for my cabinet, and begged them to furnish me\r\nwith ropes and tackle, with two good stout fellows to carry it for me,\r\npromising generous payment for the services.\r\n\r\nThey made haste to provide me with all I asked for, and we set out for\r\nthe mountain path at daybreak. Yuliana, in order not to seem to be of\r\nthe party, had gone on ahead by the light of the moon, telling her\r\npeople that she wished to gather certain herbs before the sun’s rays\r\nstruck them and dried the healing dew that beaded their leaves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ALONG A HIGHWAY OF THE UNDER WORLD.]\r\n\r\nAll went well until the sun was well up over our heads, when suddenly I\r\nheard a woman, who proved to be Yuliana, utter a piercing scream. In a\r\nmoment or so the mystery was solved. The old beldam came rushing down\r\nthe mountain, her thin wisp of gray hair fluttering in the wind. Her\r\nhands were tied behind her, and two young peasants with birchen rods\r\nwere beating her every chance they got.\r\n\r\n“Turn back, turn back, brothers,” they cried to my two men. “The little\r\nwizard there has struck hands with this old witch. They’re on their way\r\nto the Giants’ Well. They’ll loosen a band of black spirits about our\r\nears. We shall all be bewitched. Quick! Quick! Cast off the loads ye’re\r\nbearing and follow us.”\r\n\r\nThe two men didn’t wait for a second bidding, and throwing the tackle on\r\nthe ground, they all disappeared like a flash, but for several moments I\r\ncould hear the screams of poor Yuliana as these young wretches beat the\r\nold woman with their birchen rods.\r\n\r\nWell, dear readers, what say ye to this? Was I not in a pleasant\r\nposition truly? Alone with Bulger in that wild and gloomy mountain\r\nregion, the black rocks hanging like frowning giants and ogres over our\r\nheads, with the dwarf pines for hair, clumps of white moss for eyes,\r\nvast, gaping cracks for mouths, and gnarled and twisted roots for\r\nterrible fingers, ready to reach down for my poor little weazen frame.\r\n\r\nDid I fall a-trembling? Did I make haste to follow those craven spirits\r\ndown the mountain side? Did I shift the peg of my courage a single hole\r\nlower?\r\n\r\nNot I. If I had I wouldn’t have been worthy of the name I bore. What I\r\ndid do was to throw myself at full length on a bed of moss, call Bulger\r\nto my side, and close my eyes to the outer world.\r\n\r\nI have heard of great men going to bed at high noon to give themselves\r\nup to thought, and I had often done it myself before I had heard of\r\ntheir doing it.\r\n\r\nIn fifteen minutes, by nature’s watch—the sun on the face of the\r\nmountain—I had solved the problem. Now, there were two difficulties\r\nstaring me in the face; namely, to find somebody to show me the way up\r\nthe mountain, and if that body couldn’t carry my tackle, then to find\r\nsomebody else who could.\r\n\r\nIt suddenly occurred to me that I had noticed some cattle grazing at the\r\nfoot of the mountain, and, what’s more, that these cattle wore very\r\npeculiar yokes.\r\n\r\n“What are those yokes for?” I asked myself, for they were of a make\r\nquite different from any that I remembered ever having seen, and\r\nconsisted of a stout wooden collar from the bottom of which there\r\nprojected backward between the beast’s forelegs a straight piece of wood\r\narmed with an iron spike pointing toward the ground. At the top the yoke\r\nwas bound by a leather thong to the animal’s horns. So long, therefore,\r\nas the beast held his head naturally or even lowered it to graze, the\r\nyoke was drawn forward and the hook was kept free from the ground, but\r\nthe very moment the animal raised his head in the air, at once the hook\r\nwas thrown into the ground and he was prevented from taking another step\r\nforward. Now, dear readers, you may or may not know that when a\r\ncleft-hoofed animal starts to ascend a steep bank, unlike a solid-hoofed\r\nbeast, he throws his head into the air instead of lowering it, and\r\ntherefore it struck me at once that the purpose of this yoke was to keep\r\nthe cattle from making their way up the sides of the mountain and\r\ngetting lost.\r\n\r\nBut why should they want to clamber up the mountain sides? Simply\r\nbecause there was some kind of grass or herbage growing up there which\r\nwas a delicacy to them, and knowing, as I well did, what risks animals\r\nwill take and what fatigue they will undergo to reach a favorite\r\ngrazing-ground, it struck me at once that if I would make it possible\r\nfor them to reach this favorite food of theirs, they would be very glad\r\nto give me a lift on my way.\r\n\r\nNo sooner said than done. I forthwith retraced my steps until I fell in\r\nwith a group of these cattle; and it did not take me many minutes to\r\nloosen their yokes from their horns and tie the hooks up under their\r\nbodies so that their progress up hill would not be interfered with.\r\n\r\nThey were delighted to find themselves so unexpectedly freed from the\r\nhateful drawback which permitted them merely to view the coveted\r\ngrazing-grounds from afar, and then having cut me a suitable goad, I\r\nagain started up the mountain, driving my new friends leisurely on ahead\r\nof me.\r\n\r\nUpon reaching the spot where the superstitious peasants had thrown the\r\ntackle to the ground, I proceeded to load it upon the back of the\r\ngentlest beast of the lot, and was soon on my way again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V\r\n\r\n  UP AND STILL UP, AND THROUGH THE QUARRIES OF THE DEMONS.—HOW THE\r\n    CATTLE KEPT THE TRAIL, AND HOW WE CAME AT LAST UPON THE BRINK OF\r\n    THE GIANTS’ WELL.—THE TERRACES ARE SAFELY PASSED.—BEGINNING OF THE\r\n    DESCENT INTO THE WELL ITSELF.—ALL DIFFICULTIES OVERCOME.—WE REACH\r\n    THE EDGE OF POLYPHEMUS’ FUNNEL.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, people with very large heads are fitted out by\r\nnature with a pair of rather pipe-stemmy legs, but such was not my case.\r\nI was blest with legs of the sturdiest sort, and found no difficulty in\r\nkeeping pace with my new four-footed friends who, to my delight, were\r\nnot long in convincing me that they had been there before. Not for an\r\ninstant did they halt at any fork in the path, but kept continually on\r\nthe move, often passing over stretches of ground where there was no\r\ntrail visible, but coming upon it again with unfailing accuracy. Once\r\nonly they halted, and that was to slake their thirst at a mountain rill,\r\nBulger and I following their example.\r\n\r\nIt was only too evident to me that they had in mind a certain\r\ngrazing-ground, and were resolved to be satisfied with no other; so I\r\nlet them have their own way, for, as it was still up, up, up, I felt\r\nthat it was perfectly safe to follow their lead.\r\n\r\nAt last the mountain side began to take on quite another character. The\r\ngorges grew narrower, and at times overhanging rocks shut out the\r\nsunlight almost entirely. We were entering a region of peculiar\r\nwildness, of fantastic grandeur.\r\n\r\nI had often read of what travellers termed the “Quarries of the Demons”\r\nin the Northern Urals, but never till now had I the faintest notion of\r\nwhat the expression meant.\r\n\r\nImagine to yourself the usual look of ruin and devastation around and\r\nabout a quarry worked by human hands, then in your thoughts conceive\r\nevery chip to be a block, and every block a mass; add four times its\r\nsize to every slab and post and pediment, and then turn a mighty torrent\r\nthrough the place and roll and twist and lift them up in wild confusion,\r\nend on end and on each other piled, till these wild waters have builded\r\nfantastic portals to temples more fantastic, and arched wild gorges with\r\nroofs of rock which seem to hang so lightly that a breath or footfall\r\nmight bring them down with terrible crash, and then, dear friends, you\r\nmay succeed in getting a faint idea of the wild and awful grandeur of\r\nthe scene which now lay spread out before me.\r\n\r\nWould the cattle that had now led Bulger and me so safely up the\r\nmountain side know where to find an entrance to this wilderness of\r\nbroken rock, and what was more important still, would they, when once\r\nengaged within its winding courts and corridors, its darkened maze of\r\nwall and parapet, its streets and plazas roughly paved as if by demon\r\nhands impatient of the task, know how to find their way out again?\r\n\r\nDear friends, man has always been too distrustful of his four-footed\r\ncompanions. They have much that they might tell us had they but speech\r\nto tell it with. I have often trusted them when it would have seemed\r\nfoolhardy to you, and never once have I had cause to repent of doing so.\r\n\r\nSo Bulger and I, with stout hearts, followed straight after these silent\r\nguides, although I must confess my legs were beginning to feel the\r\nterrible strain I had put them to; but I resolved to push on ahead, at\r\nleast until we had cleared the Demons’ Quarry, and then to bring my\r\nlittle herd to a halt and pass the rest of the day and the night season\r\nin well-earned repose.\r\n\r\nOnce within the quarry, however, all sense of fatigue vanished, and my\r\nthankful mind, entranced and fascinated by the deep silence, the awful\r\ngrandeur, the mysterious lights and shadows of the place, lent me new\r\nstrength. At length we had traversed this city of silence and gloom, and\r\nonce again we emerged into the full glory of the afternoon sun.\r\n\r\nSuddenly my little drove of cattle, with playful tossing of their heads,\r\nbroke into a run, Bulger and I at their heels, however. It was a mad\r\nrace; but, dear friends, when it ended I took off my fur cap and tossed\r\nit high into the air with a wild cry of joy, and Bulger broke out in a\r\nstring of yelps and barks, for, look ye, the cattle were grazing away\r\nfor dear life there in front of me, and as their breath reached me my\r\nkeen nostrils recognized the odor of Yuliana’s herbs which she had bound\r\non my hurt head.\r\n\r\nYes, we stood almost upon the brink of the Giants’ Well, but I was too\r\ntired to take another step farther, too tired, in fact, to eat, although\r\nI had a stock of dried fruit in my pockets, and noticed that the nests\r\nof the wild fowl were well supplied with eggs. Having unloosened the\r\ntackle from the back of the good beast that had carried it up the\r\nmountain for me, I threw myself on the ground and was soon fast asleep,\r\nwith my faithful Bulger coiled up close against my breast.\r\n\r\nIn the morning the cattle were nowhere to be seen, but I didn’t trouble\r\nmyself about them, for I knew that old Yuliana would be sent up after\r\nthem the moment they were missed. After a hearty breakfast on half a\r\ndozen roasted eggs of the wild fowl, with some dried fruit and\r\nwintergreen berries, Bulger and I advanced to the edge of the Giants’\r\nWell, or, rather, to the edge of the vast terraces of rock leading down\r\nto it, each of which was from thirty to fifty feet in sheer height.\r\n\r\nBefore I go any farther, dear friends, I must beg you to remember that I\r\nam an expert in the use of tackle, there being no knot, noose, or splice\r\nknown to a sailor which I didn’t have at my fingers’ ends, a fact not to\r\nbe wondered at when you take into consideration the thousands of miles\r\nwhich I have travelled on water.\r\n\r\nNor would I have you shake your heads and look only half persuaded when\r\nI go on describing our descent into the Giants’ Well, for of course\r\nyou’ll be asking yourselves how I succeeded in getting the tackle down\r\nwhen there was no one left at the other end to untie it!\r\n\r\nKnow, then, that that was the smallest of my troubles; for, as any\r\nsailor will tell you, you only need to tie your line in what is known as\r\na “fool’s knot,” to one end of which you make fast a mere cord. The\r\nmoment you have reached the bottom, a sharp tug at the cord unties the\r\nfool’s knot, and your tackle falls down after you. My method was to\r\nlower Bulger down first, and then let myself down after him. In this way\r\nwe proceeded from parapet to parapet, until at last we stood upon the\r\nvery edge of the vast well, the existence of which had been so\r\nmysteriously hinted at in Don Fum’s manuscript. Its mouth was probably\r\nfifty feet in width, and by straining my eyes I satisfied myself of the\r\nexistence of a shelf of rock on one side, as nearly as I could judge\r\nabout seventy-five feet down. It was a goodly stretch, and would require\r\nevery foot of my rope. You will not smile, I’m sure, when I tell you\r\nthat I pressed Bulger to my breast, and kissed him fondly before\r\nlowering away. He returned my caresses, and by his joyous yelp gave me\r\nto understand that he had perfect faith in his little master.\r\n\r\nIn a few moments I had joined him on this narrow shelf of rock. Below us\r\nnow was darkness, but think you I hesitated? I knew that my eyes would\r\nsoon become accustomed to the gloom, and I also knew that when my eyes\r\nfailed Bulger’s keener ones were there to help me out.\r\n\r\nI rigged my tackle now with extra care, for I was really lowering my\r\nlittle brother on a sort of trip of discovery.\r\n\r\nHe was soon out of sight, and then, in spite of my calmness, I drew a\r\nquick breath, and my heart started upward a barleycorn or so. But hark!\r\nhis quick, sharp bark comes plainly up to me. It means that he has\r\nlanded upon a safe shelf or ledge, and the next moment my legs encircled\r\nthe rope, and I began to glide noiselessly down into the stilly depths,\r\nhis glad voice ringing in my ears.\r\n\r\nAgain and again did I send my wise and watchful little brother down\r\nahead of me, until at last, standing there and looking up, naught\r\nremained to me of the mighty outside world but a bright silver speck,\r\nlike a tiny ray of light streaming through a pin-hole in the curtains of\r\nyour chamber.\r\n\r\nBut stop, have we reached the bottom of the Giants’ Well? for with a\r\ntrial plummet I find that the walls are no longer sheer; they slope\r\ninward, and gently too, almost so much so that I hardly need a line to\r\ncontinue my descent. Lighting one of my little tapers, I make my way\r\ncautiously around the edge. In half an hour I find myself back at the\r\nstarting-place. The curve to the path has been always the same, while my\r\ntrial plummet at all times has indicated the same slope to the rocky\r\nbasin. And then for the first time, two certain words made use of by\r\nthat learned Master of Masters, Don Fum, till then a mystery to me,\r\nstood out before my eyes as if written with a pen of fire upon those\r\nblack walls thousands of feet below the great world of light which I had\r\nquitted a few hours before. Those words were Polyphemus’ Funnel! Yes,\r\nthere could be no doubt of it: I had reached the bottom of the Giants’\r\nWell. I stood upon the edge of Polyphemus’ Funnel!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n  MY DESPAIR UPON FINDING THE PIPE OF THE FUNNEL TOO SMALL FOR MY\r\n    BODY.—A RAY OF HOPE BREAKS IN UPON ME.—FULL ACCOUNT OF HOW I\r\n    SUCCEEDED IN ENTERING THE PIPE OF THE FUNNEL.—MY PASSAGE THROUGH\r\n    IT.—BULGER’S TIMELY AID.—THE MARBLE HIGHWAY AND SOME CURIOUS\r\n    THINGS CONCERNING THE ENTRANCE TO THE WORLD WITHIN A WORLD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rocky sides of Polyphemus’ Funnel were apparently as well polished\r\nas those of any tin funnel that I had ever seen hanging in the kitchen\r\nof Castle Trump, so making fast my tackle and taking Bulger in my arms,\r\naway we went sliding down the side with the line passed under my arm for\r\nsafety’s sake.\r\n\r\nIt was nearly a hundred feet to the bottom, for I had measured off the\r\nfull length of my line before I had come to the apex of this gigantic\r\ncone, and not caring to tumble headlong down its pipe, I proceeded to\r\nlight a taper and look about me.\r\n\r\nAh, dear friends, I can feel that shudder now, so terrible was it, and\r\nwhat wonder, too, for a glance at the pipe of the funnel told me that it\r\nwas too small to let my body pass through. The agonizing thought flashed\r\nthrough my mind that I had committed a terrible error—that I had\r\nmistaken some vast pit for the Giants’ Well, that I had thrown Bulger’s\r\nand my own life away in mad and unreasoning haste, that I should never\r\nreach the wonderful World within a World, that there in that thick gloom\r\nmust we lay our bodies and bones.\r\n\r\nOr, thought I, may not the learned Master of Masters, Don Fum, have made\r\nan error himself in holding out the idea that the pipe of Polyphemus’\r\nFunnel was large enough to admit the passage of a man’s body?\r\n\r\nIn my almost frenzy I advanced to the mouth of the pipe, and, lowering\r\nmyself into it, let my body sink as far as it would.\r\n\r\nIt caught at the shoulders, and after a careful examination I was forced\r\nto reach the brain-racking conclusion that my faithful Bulger and I had\r\ntravelled our last mile together.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing for us to do but to lie down and die.\r\n\r\nLie down and die? Never! I had noticed in making the descent into the\r\nGiants’ Well that its side had much the appearance of being walled\r\naround by blocks of stone. With Bulger strapped to my back I would\r\nslowly climb up from shelf to shelf until my strength failed me, and\r\nthen I would wait until I thought old Yuliana had come back to gather\r\nherbs, and possibly I might make her hear me.\r\n\r\nIn my despair I sighed and clutched my own arms, and as I did so one of\r\nmy hands came into contact with something cold and slippery having the\r\nfeel of tallow. Taking a pinch of the substance between my thumb and\r\nfinger, I rubbed it thoughtfully for a moment, and then a ray of hope\r\nbroke through the awful gloom that enshrouded me so pitilessly. It was\r\nblack lead—there could be no doubt of it. It had made its way through a\r\ncrack or crevice in Polyphemus’ Funnel, and I had rubbed it off in\r\nsliding down the side. With this greasy material to rub on the inside of\r\nthe pipe to the funnel, and also to besmear myself with, mayhap I might\r\nyet slip through into the World within a World!\r\n\r\nAt any rate, I determined to make the trial, even if I left some of my\r\nskin on the flinty rock.\r\n\r\nIn order to collect my thoughts thoroughly, and that I might proceed\r\nstep by step in that systematic order so characteristic of all my\r\nwonderful exploits, I sat down, and putting my arm around dear Bulger’s\r\nneck and drawing him up against me, I communed with myself for a good\r\nhalf-hour.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BEFORE HER MAJESTY GALAXA, QUEEN OF THE MIKKAMENKIES.]\r\n\r\nThen all was in readiness for action; and to prove to you, dear friends,\r\nhow careful Bulger was not to interrupt my train of thought, I have to\r\nreport to you that although a small animal of the rat family came out\r\nfrom a crevice in the rock while I sat there thinking, as I could see by\r\nthe light of my tiny wax taper, and had the temerity first to sniff at\r\nBulger’s tail and then to give it a playful nip, yet the sagacious\r\nanimal never budged a hair’s breadth.\r\n\r\n“Mind hath ordered, now let hands obey!” I exclaimed, as I sprang up and\r\nbegan stripping off my outer garments. This done, I clambered up on the\r\nside of the funnel, and began to collect a supply of the black lead,\r\nwhich I deposited near the opening of the pipe. The next thing to do was\r\nto get Bulger through the pipe ahead of me. To this end I tied him up in\r\nmy clothing, bag fashion, and began to lower away.\r\n\r\nAfter paying out sixty-five or seventy feet of the line, he struck\r\nbottom, and by his loud barking gave me to understand that it was all\r\nright, that I might make the descent myself. Upon hearing his voice, I\r\ngave the line a few sharp tugs. He was not slow to comprehend my\r\nmeaning, and in a moment or so had not only scrambled out of the bag\r\nhimself, but pulled my clothing loose, so that I might draw the line up\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nMy next step was to contrive a way to weight myself when the moment\r\narrived to begin the descent, for I felt sure that I never should be\r\nable to arrange it so as to slip through the pipe unless something was\r\npulling at my heels.\r\n\r\nCutting off about ten feet of the rope, I made fast one end of the piece\r\nto a long piece of rock, weighing about a hundred pounds. This I laid\r\nnear the mouth of the pipe ready for use. But now came the most\r\ndifficult thing of all—it was to draw my shoulders in on my breast and\r\nlash them securely in that position, by which plan I expected to reduce\r\nmy width by at least two good inches.\r\n\r\nThese two inches thus gained, or, rather, lost, might be the means by\r\nwhich I would be able to slip through the pipe of Polyphemus’ Funnel and\r\nreach the vast underground passage leading to the World within a World.\r\nPutting a noose around my chest, just below my collar bone, I drew my\r\nshoulders in as tight as I could bear, and changed the slip knot into a\r\nhard one; then having made the other end of the line fast to the side of\r\nthe funnel, I proceeded to wind myself up as the housewives often do a\r\nbig sausage to keep it from bursting. This done, I set about rolling in\r\nthe black lead until I was thoroughly smeared with it.\r\n\r\nThere was now but one thing more to do before dropping myself into the\r\npipe, and that was to make fast the weight to my feet. It was no easy\r\ntask, wound up as I was, with my arms lashed down against my body, but\r\nby the use of slip knots I finally accomplished the feat, and sitting\r\ndown put my legs into the pipe and drew a long breath, for I felt as if\r\nI was skewered up in a straight jacket.\r\n\r\nBending down, I called out to Bulger. He answered with a yelp of joy\r\nthat brought fresh vigor to my heart. Now was come the supreme moment\r\nwhich was to witness success or failure. Failure! Oh, what a dread word\r\nis that! and yet how often must human lips pronounce it, and in so doing\r\nbreathe out the sigh in which it ends! Quickly lowering the weight, I\r\nwriggled off the edge of the opening, and straightened myself out as I\r\nslipped into the pipe.\r\n\r\nHad I stopped it like a cork, or was I moving? Yes, down, down, gently,\r\nslowly, noiselessly, I went slipping through the pipe to Polyphemus’\r\nFunnel. What did I care how that weight caused the line to cut into my\r\nankles? I was moving, I was drawing nearer and nearer to Bulger, whose\r\njoyous bark I could hear now and then, nearer to the inner gates of the\r\nWorld within a World!\r\n\r\nBut woe is me! I suddenly stop, and in spite of all my efforts to start\r\nagain by twisting, turning, and shaking my body, it refused to sink\r\nanother inch, and there I stick.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Bulger, Bulger,” I moan, “faithful friend, if thou couldst but\r\nreach me, one tug from thee might save thy little master!”\r\n\r\nIn a sort of a wild and desperate way I now began to feel about me as\r\nwell as I could with my hands wedged in so close to my sides, but in a\r\nmoment or so I had discovered the cause of my coming to such a sudden\r\nstandstill.\r\n\r\nI had struck a portion of the pipe that had a thread to it, like that\r\nwhich encircles a bolt of iron and makes a screw of it, and the thought\r\ncame to me that if I could only succeed in giving a revolving motion to\r\nmy body, I would with every turn twist myself farther down toward the\r\nend of the pipe.\r\n\r\nI could feel that my knuckles and finger tips were being bruised and\r\nlacerated by this arduous work, but what cared I for the keen pain that\r\ndarted from hands to wrists, and wrists to elbows! It was like twisting\r\na screw slowly through a long nut, only the thread in this case was on\r\nthe nut and the grooves in the screw, and that screw was my poor bruised\r\nlittle body!\r\n\r\nAll of a sudden, by the swinging of the weight, I could tell that it had\r\npassed out at the lower end of the pipe. It was pulling cruelly hard on\r\nmy tender ankles, but I could twist myself no more; my strength was\r\ngone. I was at the point of swooning when I heard Bulger utter a loud\r\nyelp, and the next instant there was such a strong tug at my ankles that\r\nI sent forth a groan, but that tug saved me! It was Bulger who had\r\nleaped into the air, and catching the rope in his teeth had dragged his\r\nlittle master out of the pipe of Polyphemus’ Funnel!\r\n\r\nWe all fell into the same heap, Bulger, I, and the weight, fully ten\r\nfeet, and very serious might have been the consequences for me had my\r\nfall not been broken by my striking on the pile of my clothing placed\r\ndirectly under the opening; and, dear friends, if you talked until the\r\ncrack o’ doom you could not make me believe that my four-footed brother\r\nhadn’t placed those clothes there to catch me.\r\n\r\nThey weren’t thrown higgledy-piggledy into a heap either, but were laid\r\none upon the other, the heaviest at the bottom.\r\n\r\nHaving unwound myself and lighted one of my wax tapers, I made haste to\r\ncast away the undergarment with its coating of black lead and resume my\r\nclothing; then stooping down, I made an examination of the floor. It was\r\ncomposed of huge blocks of marble of various colors, polished almost as\r\nsmooth as if the hand of man had wrought the work; and then I knew that\r\nI was on Nature’s Marble Highway leading to the cities of the under\r\nworld which Don Fum had mentioned in his book, and I remembered, too,\r\nthat he had spoken of Nature’s Mighty Mosaics, huge fantastic figures on\r\nthe walls of these lofty corridors, made up of various colored blocks\r\nand fragments laid one upon the other as if with design, and not by the\r\nwild, tempestuous whims of upbursting forces thousands of years ago,\r\nwhen the earth was in its mad and wayward youth. After a rest of several\r\nhours, during which I nursed my torn hands and bruised fingers, Bulger\r\nand I were up and off again along this broad and glorious Marble\r\nHighway. Strange to say, it was not the inky darkness of the ordinary\r\ncavern which filled these magnificent chambers, through which the Marble\r\nHighway went winding in stately and massive grandeur; far from it. The\r\ngloom was tempered by a faint glow that met us on the way ever and anon,\r\nlike a ray of twilight gone astray. Anyway, Bulger, I noticed, could see\r\nperfectly well; so tying a bit of twine to his collar, I sent him on\r\nahead, convinced that I could have no surer guide.\r\n\r\nAt times our path would be lighted up for an instant by the bursting-out\r\nof a little tongue of flame either on the sides or from the roof of the\r\ngallery. I was puzzled for quite a while to tell what it proceeded from;\r\nbut at last I caught sight of the source, or rather the maker, of this\r\nwelcome illumination. It proceeded from a lizard-like animal, which, by\r\nsuddenly uncoiling its tail, had the power to emit this extremely bright\r\nflash of phosphorescent light, and in so doing he made a sharp crack,\r\nfor all the world like the noise of an electric spark. Bulger was\r\ndelighted with this performance; and on one occasion, not being able to\r\ncontrol his feeling, he uttered a sharp bark, whereupon apparently ten\r\nthousand of these little torch-bearers snapped their tails at me at the\r\nsame instant, and filled the vast place with a flash of light of almost\r\nlightning-like intensity.\r\n\r\nBulger was so frightened by the result of his applause that he took good\r\ncare to keep quiet after this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n  OUR FIRST NIGHT IN THE UNDER WORLD, AND HOW IT WAS FOLLOWED BY THE\r\n    FIRST BREAK OF DAY.—BULGER’S WARNING AND WHAT IT MEANT.—WE FALL IN\r\n    WITH AN INHABITANT OF THE WORLD WITHIN A WORLD.—HIS NAME AND\r\n    CALLING.—MYSTERIOUS RETURN OF NIGHT.—THE LAND OF BEDS, AND HOW OUR\r\n    NEW FRIEND PROVIDED ONE FOR US.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo heavy with sleep did my eyelids become at last that I knew that it\r\nmust be night in the outer world, and so we halted, and I stretched\r\nmyself at full length on that marble floor, which, by the way, was\r\npleasantly warm beneath us; and the air, too, was strangely comforting\r\nto the lungs, there being a complete absence of that smell of earth and\r\nodor of dampness so common in vast subterranean chambers.\r\n\r\nMy sleep was long-continued and most refreshing; Bulger was already\r\nawake, however, when I sat up and tried to look about me.\r\n\r\nHe began tugging at the string which I had fastened to his collar as if\r\nhe wanted to lead me somewhere, so I humored him and followed along\r\nafter. To my delight he led me straight to a pool of deliciously sweet\r\nand cold water. Here we drank our fill, and after a very frugal\r\nbreakfast on some dried figs set out again on our journey along the\r\nMarble Highway. Suddenly, to my more than joy, the faint and uncertain\r\nlight of the place began to strengthen. Why, it seemed almost as if the\r\nday of the upper world were about to break, so delicate were the various\r\nhues in which the ever-increasing light clothed itself: then, as if\r\naffrighted at its own increasing glory, it would fade away again to\r\nalmost gloom. Ere many moments again this faint and mysterious glow\r\nwould return, beginning with the softest yellow, then changing through a\r\ndozen different tints, and, like a fickle maid uncertain which to wear,\r\nput all aside and don the lily’s garb. Bulger and I wandered along the\r\nMarble Highway almost afraid to break a stillness so deep that it seemed\r\nto me as if I could hear those sportive rays of light in their play\r\nagainst the many-colored rocks arching this mighty corridor.\r\n\r\nNow, as the Marble Highway swept around in a graceful curve, a dazzling\r\nflood of light burst upon us.\r\n\r\nIt was sunrise in the World within a World.\r\n\r\nWhence came this flood of dazzling light which now caused the sides and\r\narching roof to glow and sparkle as if we had suddenly entered one of\r\nNature’s vast storehouses of polished gems? Shading my eyes with my hand\r\nI looked about me in order to try and solve the mystery.\r\n\r\nIt did not take me long to understand it all. Know then, dear friends,\r\nthat the ceilings, domes, and arched roofs of this underground world\r\nwere fretted with a metal of greater hardness than any known to us\r\nchildren of sunshine. Its seams ran hither and thither like the veins of\r\ngigantic leaves; and at certain hours currents of electricity from some\r\nvast internal reservoir of Nature’s own building, streamed through these\r\nmetal traceries until they glowed with a heat so white as to give off\r\nthe flood of dazzling light of which I have already spoken.\r\n\r\nThe current never came with a sudden rush or burst, but began gently and\r\ntimidly, so to speak, as if feeling its way along. Hence the beautiful\r\ntints that always preceded sunrise in this lower world, and made it so\r\nmuch like the coming and going of our glorious sunshine.\r\n\r\nThe Marble Highway now divided, and the two halves of the fork curving\r\naway to the right and left enclosed a small but exquisitely ornamented\r\npark, or pleasure ground I might call it, provided with seats of some\r\ndark wood beautifully polished and carved. This park was ornamented with\r\nfour fountains, each springing from a crystal basin and spreading out\r\ninto a feathery spray that glistened like whirling snow in the dazzling\r\nwhite light. As Bulger and I directed our steps toward one of the\r\nbenches with the intention of taking a good rest, a low growl from him\r\nwarned me to be on the alert. I gave a second look. A human being was\r\nseated on the bench. Beside myself, as I was, with curiosity to come\r\nface to face with this inhabitant of the under world, the first we had\r\nmet, I made a halt, determined to ascertain, if possible, whether he was\r\nquite harmless before accosting him.\r\n\r\nHe was small in stature, and clad entirely in black, a sort of loose,\r\nflowing robe much like a Roman toga. His head was bare, and what I could\r\nsee of it was round, smooth, and rosy, with about as much hair, or\r\nrather fuzz, upon it as the head of an infant six weeks old. His face\r\nwas hidden by a black fan which he carried in his right hand, and the\r\nuses of which you will learn later on. His eyes were shielded from the\r\nintense glare of the light by a pair of colored glass goggles. As he\r\nraised his hand between me and the light I couldn’t help catching my\r\nbreath. I could see right through it: the bones were as clear as amber.\r\nAnd his head, too, was only a little less opaque. Suddenly two words\r\nfrom Don Fum’s manuscript flashed through my mind, and I exclaimed\r\njoyously,—\r\n\r\n“Bulger, we’re in the Land of the Transparent Folk!”\r\n\r\nAt the sound of my voice the little man arose and made a low bow,\r\nlowering his fan to his breast where he held it. His baby face was\r\nludicrously sad and solemn.\r\n\r\n“Yes, Sir Stranger,” said he, in a low, musical voice, “thou art indeed\r\nin the Land of the Mikkamenkies (Mica Men), in the Land of the\r\nTransparent Folk, called also Goggle Land; but if I should show thee my\r\nheart thou wouldst see that I am deeply pained to think that I should\r\nhave been the first to bid thee welcome, for know, Sir Stranger, that\r\nthou speakest with Master Cold Soul the Court Depressor, the saddest man\r\nin all Goggle Land, and, by the way, sir, permit me to offer thee a pair\r\nof goggles for thyself, and also a pair for thy four-footed companion,\r\nfor our intense white light would blind thee both in a few days.”\r\n\r\nI thanked Master Cold Soul very warmly for the goggles, and proceeded to\r\nset one pair astride my nose and to tie the other in front of Bulger’s\r\neyes. I then in most courteous manner informed Master Cold Soul who I\r\nwas, and begged him to explain the cause of his great sadness. “Well,\r\nthou must know, little baron,” said he, after I had taken a seat beside\r\nhim on the bench, “that we, the loving subjects of Queen Galaxa, whose\r\nroyal heart is almost run down,—excuse these tears, living as we do in\r\nthis beautiful world so unlike the one you inhabit, which our wise men\r\ntell us is built, strange to say, on the very outside of the earth’s\r\ncrust where it is most exposed to the full sweep of blinding snow,\r\nfreezing blast, pelting hail, drowning rain, and choking dust,—living as\r\nwe do, I say, in this vast temple by Nature’s own hands builded, where\r\ndisease is unknown, and where our hearts run down like clocks that may\r\nhave but one winding, we are prone, alas, to be too happy; to laugh too\r\nmuch; to spend too much time in idle gayety, chattering the time away\r\nlike thoughtless children amused with baubles, delighted with tinsel\r\nnothings. Know then, little baron, that mine is the business to check\r\nthis gayety, to put an end to this childish glee, to depress our\r\npeople’s spirits, lest they run too high. Hence my garb of inky hue, my\r\nrueful countenance, my frequent outflowing of tears, my voice ever\r\nattuned to sadness. Excuse me, little baron, my fan slipped then; didst\r\nsee through me? I would not have thee see my heart to-day, for some way\r\nor other I cannot bring it to a slow pace; it is dreadfully unruly.”\r\n\r\nI assured him that I had not seen through him as yet.\r\n\r\nAnd now, dear friends, I must explain that by the laws of the\r\nMikkamenkies each man, woman, and child must wear in their garments a\r\nheart-shaped opening on their breast directly over their hearts, with a\r\ncorresponding one at the back, so that under certain conditions, when\r\nthe law allows it, each may have the right to take a look at his\r\nneighbor’s heart and see exactly how it is beating—whether fast or slow,\r\nwhether throbbing or leaping, or whether pulsating calmly and naturally.\r\nBut this privilege is only accorded, as I have said, under certain\r\nconditions, hence to shut off inquisitive glances each Mikkamenky is\r\nallowed to carry a black fan with which to cover the heart-shaped\r\nopening above described, and in this way conceal his or her feelings to\r\na degree. I say to a degree, for I may as well tell you right here that\r\nfalsehood is unknown, or, more correctly stated, impossible in the land\r\nof the Transparent Folk, for the reason that so wondrously clear,\r\nlimpid, and crystal-like are their eyes that the slightest attempt to\r\nsay one thing while they are thinking another roils and clouds them as\r\nif a drop of milk had fallen into a glass of the purest water.\r\n\r\nAs I sat gazing at this strange little being seated on the bench there\r\nbeside me, I recalled a conversation which I had had with a learned\r\nRussian at Solvitchegodsk. Said he, speaking of his people, “We are all\r\nborn with light hair, brilliant eyes, and pale faces, for we have sprung\r\nup under the snow.” And I thought to myself how delighted, how\r\nentranced, he would have been to look upon this curious being, born not\r\nunder the snow, but far under the surface of the earth, where in these\r\nvast chambers of this World within a World, this strange folk had, like\r\nplants grown in a dark, deep cellar, gradually parted with all their\r\ncoloring until their eyes glowed like orbs of pure crystal, until their\r\nbones had been bleached to amber clearness, and their blood coursed\r\ncolorless through colorless veins. While sitting there following out\r\nthis train of thought, the clear white light suddenly began to flicker\r\nand to play fantastic tricks upon the walls by dancing in garbs of\r\never-changing hues, now brightest yellow, now palest green, now glorious\r\npurple, now deepest crimson.\r\n\r\n“Ah, little baron!” exclaimed Master Cold Soul, “that was an uncommonly\r\nshort day. Rise, please.”\r\n\r\nI made haste to obey, whereupon he touched a spring and the bench opened\r\nin the centre, disclosing two very comfortable beds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A DINNER EASILY PROVIDED FOR.]\r\n\r\n“In a few moments night will be upon us,” continued the Mikkamenky, “but\r\nthou seest that we have not been taken by surprise. I should explain to\r\nthee, little baron, that owing to the capricious manner in which our\r\nRiver of Light is apt both to begin and to cease flowing, we are never\r\nable to tell how long a day or a night will prove to be. This is what we\r\ncall twilight. In thy world I suppose day goes out with a terrible bang,\r\nfor our wise men tell us that nothing can be done in the upper world\r\nwithout making a noise; that your people really love noise; and that the\r\nman who makes the greatest noise is considered the greatest man.\r\n\r\n“Owing to the fact, little baron, that no one in Goggle Land can tell\r\nhow long the day will last, or how long it may be necessary to sleep,\r\nour laws permit no one to set any exact time when a thing shall be done,\r\nor to exact any promise to do this or that on a certain day, for, bless\r\nthy soul, that day may not be ten minutes long. Hence we say, ‘If\r\nto-morrow be over five hours long, come to me at the beginning of the\r\nsixth hour;’ and we never wish each other a plain good-night, but say,\r\n‘Good-night, as long as it lasts.’\r\n\r\n“What’s more, little baron, as night is apt to come upon us this way\r\nunawares, by law all the beds belong to the state; no one is allowed to\r\nown his own bed, for when night overtakes him he may be at the other end\r\nof the city, and some other subject of Queen Galaxa may be in front of\r\nhis door, and no matter where night may overtake a Mikkamenky, he is\r\nsure to find a bed. There are beds everywhere. By touching a spring they\r\ndrop from the walls, they pull out like drawers, they are under the\r\ntables and divans, in the parks, in the market-place, by the roadside;\r\nbenches, bins, boxes, barrows, and barrels by pressing a spring may in\r\nan instant be transformed into beds. It is the Land of Beds, little\r\nbaron. But ah! behold, the twilight goes to its end. Good-night as long\r\nas it lasts!” and with this Master Cold Soul stretched himself out and\r\nbegan to snore, having first carefully covered up the two holes in the\r\nfront and back of his garment, so that I shouldn’t have a chance to take\r\na peep through him in case I should wake up first. Bulger and I were\r\nright glad to lay our limbs on a real bed, although from the way my\r\nfour-footed brother followed his tail around and around, I could see\r\nthat he wasn’t particularly delighted with the softness of the couch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n  “GOOD-MORNING AS LONG AS IT LASTS.”—PLAIN TALK FROM MASTER COLD\r\n    SOUL.—WONDERS OF GOGGLE LAND.—WE ENTER THE CITY OF THE\r\n    MIKKAMENKIES.—BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF IT.—OUR APPROACH TO THE ROYAL\r\n    PALACE.—QUEEN GALAXA AND HER CRYSTAL THRONE.—MASTER COLD SOUL’S\r\n    TEARS.\r\n\r\n\r\nI don’t think the darkness lasted over three hours, perhaps it was\r\nlonger; but Master Cold Soul was obliged to shake me gently ere he could\r\nrouse me.\r\n\r\n“Now, little baron,” said he, after he had wished me a good-morning with\r\nthe usual “as long as it lasts” tacked to it, “if thou art quite\r\nwilling, I’ll conduct thee to the court of our gracious mistress, Queen\r\nGalaxa. Our wise men have often discoursed to her concerning the upper\r\nworld and the terrible sufferings of its people, exposed as they are to\r\nbe first frozen by the pitiless cold and then burned by the scorching\r\nrays of what they call their sun, and she will no doubt deign to be\r\npleased at sight of thee, although I must warn thee that thou art most\r\nuncomely, that thou seemst so black and hard to me as scarcely to be\r\nhuman, but rather a bit of living earth or rock. I greatly fear me that\r\nthou wilt make our people extremely vain by comparison. Thy four-footed\r\ncompanion we know well by sight, having often seen his petrified image\r\nin the rocks of the dark chambers of our world.”\r\n\r\n“Master Cold Soul,” said I, as we walked along, “when thou gettest to\r\nknow me better thou wilt find me more comely, and although I shall not\r\nbe able to show thee my heart, I hope to be able to prove to thee and\r\nthine that I have such a thing.”\r\n\r\n“No doubt, no doubt, little baron,” exclaimed Master Cold Soul, “but be\r\nnot offended. It is not more pleasant for me to tell thee these\r\ndisagreeable things than it is for thee to hear them, but I am paid to\r\ndo it and I must earn my wage. Vanity grows apace in our world, and I\r\nprick its bubbles whenever I see them.”\r\n\r\nTo my great wonder I now discovered that the world of the Mikkamenkies\r\nhad its lakes and rivers like our own, only of course they were smaller\r\nand mirror-faced, being never visited by the faintest zephyr. To my\r\nquestion as to whether they were peopled with living things, Master Cold\r\nSoul informed me that they literally swarmed with the most delicious\r\nfish, both in scales and shells.\r\n\r\n“But think not, little baron,” he added, “that we of Goggle Land have no\r\nother food than such as we draw from the water; for in our gardens grow\r\nmany kinds of delicate vegetables, springing up in a single night almost\r\nas light as foam and just as white. But we are small eaters, little\r\nbaron, and rarely find it necessary to put to death a large shellfish.\r\nWe merely lay hold of his great claw, which he obligingly drops into our\r\nhand, and forthwith sets about growing another.”\r\n\r\n“But tell me, I pray thee, Master Cold Soul,” said I, “where ye find the\r\nsilk to weave such soft and beautiful stuff as that thy garment is\r\nfashioned from?”\r\n\r\n“In this under world of ours, little baron,” replied Master Cold Soul,\r\n“there are many vast recesses not reached by the River of Light, and in\r\nthese dark chambers flit about huge night moths, like restless spirits\r\nforever on the wing, but of course they are not, for we find their eggs\r\nglued against the rocky sides of these caverns and collect them\r\ncarefully. The worms that are hatched from them spin huge cocoons so\r\nlarge that one may not be hidden in my hand, and these unwound give unto\r\nour looms all the thread they need.”\r\n\r\n“And the beautiful wood,” I continued, “which I see about me carved and\r\nfashioned into so many articles, whence comes it?”\r\n\r\n“From the quarries,” answered Master Cold Soul.\r\n\r\n“Quarries?” I repeated wonderingly.\r\n\r\n“Why, yes, little baron,” said he, “for we have quarries of wood as no\r\ndoubt thou hast quarries of stone. Our wise men tell us that thousands\r\nand thousands of years ago vast forests grown in your world were in the\r\nupheavals and fallings-in of the earth’s crust thrust down into ours,\r\nthe gigantic trunks wedged closely together, and standing bolt upright\r\njust as they grew. At least, so we find them when we have dug away the\r\nhardened clay that has shut them in these many ages. But see, little\r\nbaron, we are now entering the city. Yonder is the royal palace—wilt\r\nwalk with me thither?”\r\n\r\nAh, dear friends, would that I could make you see this beautiful city of\r\nthe under world just as it showed itself to me then, spread out so\r\ngloriously beneath the glittering domes and vaulted corridors, from\r\nwhich poured down upon the exquisitely carved and polished entrances to\r\nthe living chambers of this happy folk, a flood of white light\r\napparently more dazzling than our noonday sun!\r\n\r\nIt was a sight so strangely beautiful that many times I paused to gaze\r\nupon it. Young and old, all clad in the same gracefully flowing garbs of\r\nsilk, now purple, now royal blue, and now rich vermilion, were hurrying\r\nhither and thither, each armed with the inevitable black fan, and the\r\nbaby face of each aglow with life and sweet content, while a hundred\r\nfountains springing from crystal basins glistened in the dazzling white\r\nlight, and ten times a hundred flags and gonfalons hung listless but\r\nrich in splendor from invisible wires. Strange music came floating along\r\nfrom the gracefully shaped barges with silken awnings, which were\r\ngliding noiselessly over the surface of the winding river, the oars\r\nstirring the waters until the wake seemed a path through molten silver.\r\n\r\nAs Bulger and I followed Master Cold Soul along the streets of polished\r\nmarble, it was not long before a crowd of Mikkamenkies was at our heels,\r\nwhispering all sorts of uncomplimentary things about us, mingled with\r\nnot a few fits of suppressed laughter.\r\n\r\nThe Court Depressor reproved them sternly.\r\n\r\n“Cease your ill-timed mirth,” said he, “and go about your business. Must\r\nI pause and tell you a grewsome tale to check your foolish gayety? Know\r\nye not that all this silly mirth doth quicken your hearts and make them\r\nrun down just so much sooner?”\r\n\r\nAt these words of Master Cold Soul they fell back, and put an end to\r\ntheir giggling, but it was only for a moment, and by the time we reached\r\nthe portal of the royal palace, a still louder and noisier crowd was\r\nclose behind us.\r\n\r\nMaster Cold Soul suddenly halted, and drawing forth a huge\r\npocket-handkerchief, began to weep furiously. It was not without its\r\neffect, and from that moment I could see that the Mikkamenkies were\r\ninclined to take a more serious view of my arrival in their city,\r\nalthough it was only Cold Soul’s presence that kept them from bursting\r\nout into fits of violent laughter.\r\n\r\nAbove the portals of the queen’s palace there were large openings hewn\r\nin the rock for the purpose of admitting light into the royal\r\napartments; but these windows, if they may be called such, were hung\r\nwith silken curtains of delicate colors, so that the light which entered\r\nthe throne room was tempered and softened. The room itself was likewise\r\nhung with silken stuffs, which gave it a look of Oriental splendor; but\r\nnever in my travels among strange peoples of far-away lands had my eyes\r\never rested upon any work of art that equalled the crystal throne upon\r\nwhich sat Galaxa, Queen of the Mikkamenkies.\r\n\r\nIn the upper world most diligent search had never been able to unearth a\r\npiece of rock crystal more than about three feet in diameter; but here\r\nin Queen Galaxa’s throne four glorious columns at least fifteen feet in\r\nheight, and at their base three feet in diameter, shot up in matchless\r\nsplendor. Their lower parts shut in spangles of gold that glittered with\r\never-varying hues as a different light fell upon them. The cross pieces\r\nand pieces making up the back and arms had been chosen on account of the\r\nexquisitely beautiful hair and needle-shaped crystals of other metals\r\nwhich they enclosed. A silken baldachin of rare beauty covered in the\r\nthrone, and from its edges dropped heavy cords and tassels of rich color\r\nand the perfection of human handicraft as to fineness and finish.\r\n\r\nAt the foot of the throne sat the young princess Crystallina; and\r\nstanding behind her, and engaged in combing her long silken tresses, was\r\nher favorite waiting-maid, Damozel Glow Stone, while around and about,\r\nin files and group-wise, stood lords and ladies, courtiers and\r\ncounsellors, by the dozen.\r\n\r\nAs Master Cold Soul advanced to salute the queen, a throng of the idlers\r\nwho had followed at our heels crowded into the anteroom with loud\r\noutbursts of laughter. The Court Depressor was greatly incensed, and\r\nturning upon the throng he began weeping again with wonderful energy;\r\nbut I noticed that it was nothing but sound: not a tear fell to obscure\r\nthe crystal clearness of his eyes. Then he began chanting a sort of song\r\nwhich was intended to have a depressing influence on the wild mirth of\r\nthe Mikkamenkies. I can only recollect one verse of this solemn chant of\r\nthe Court Depressor. It ran as follows:—\r\n\r\n           “Weep, Mikkamenkies, weep, O weep,\r\n             For the eyeless man in the City of Light,\r\n             For the mouthless man in Plenty’s bowers,\r\n             For the earless man in Music’s realm,\r\n             For the noseless man in the Kingdom of flowers,\r\n           Weep, Mikkamenkies, weep, O weep!”\r\n\r\nBut they only laughed the louder, crying out,—\r\n\r\n“Nay, Master Cold Soul, we will not weep for them; weep for them\r\nthyself.” At last Queen Galaxa raised the slender golden wand, tipped\r\nwith a diamond point, that lay within her hand, and instantly a hush\r\ncame upon the whole place, while every eye was riveted upon Bulger and\r\nme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n  BULGER AND I ARE PRESENTED TO QUEEN GALAXA, THE LADY OF THE CRYSTAL\r\n    THRONE.—HOW SHE RECEIVED US.—HER DELIGHT OVER BULGER, WHO GIVES\r\n    PROOF OF HIS WONDERFUL INTELLIGENCE IN MANY WAYS.—HOW THE QUEEN\r\n    CREATES HIM LORD BULGER.—ALL ABOUT THE THREE WISE MEN IN WHOSE\r\n    CARE WE ARE PLACED BY QUEEN GALAXA.\r\n\r\n\r\nOwing to the soft air, the never-varying temperature, and the absence of\r\nall noise and dust, the Mikkamenkies, although they die in the end like\r\nother folk, yet do they never seem to grow old. Their skin remains soft\r\nand free from wrinkles, and their eyes as clear and bright as the\r\ncrystal of Queen Galaxa’s throne.\r\n\r\nAt the time of our arrival in the Land of the Transparent Folk, Queen\r\nGalaxa’s heart had almost run down. In about two weeks more it would\r\ncome quietly and gently to a stop; for, as I have already told you, dear\r\nfriends, the heart of a Mikkamenky being perfectly visible when the\r\ndazzling white light in its full strength was allowed to shine through\r\nhis body, why, it was a very easy matter for a physician to take a look\r\nat the organ of life, and tell almost to the hour when it would exhaust\r\nitself—in other words, run down. Galaxa looked every inch a real queen\r\nas she half-reclined upon her glorious crystal throne. She was clad in\r\nlong, flowing silk garments of a right royal purple, and the gems which\r\nencircled her neck and wrists would have put to shame the crown jewels\r\nof any monarch of the upper world. Her garb had very much the cut and\r\nstyle of the ancient Greek costume, and the gold sandals worn by her\r\nadded to the resemblance; but the one thing that excited my wonder more\r\nthan all the others put together was her hair, so long, so fine and\r\nsilken was it, such a mass of it was there, and so dazzling white was\r\nit—not the blue or yellow white that comes of age in our world, but a\r\nmilk white, a cotton white. And as we drew near, to Bulger’s but not to\r\nmy amazement, her hair began to quiver and rustle and rise, until it\r\nburied her whole throne completely out of sight. Of course I knew that,\r\nseated as she was upon a throne of glass, it was only necessary to send\r\na gentle current of electricity through her to make her wonderful head\r\nof hair stand up in this manner, like the white and filmy tentacles of\r\nsome gigantic creature of the sea, half-plant, half-animal.\r\n\r\n“Rise, little baron,” said Queen Galaxa, as I dropped upon my right knee\r\non the lowest step of the throne, “and be welcome to our kingdom. Whilst\r\nthou may be pleased to tarry here, my people shall bestir themselves to\r\nshow thee all that may seem wonderful in thine eyes; for although our\r\nwise men have often discussed to us of the upper world, yet art thou its\r\nfirst inhabitant to visit us, and thy wonderful companion is right\r\nwelcome too. Can he talk, little baron?”\r\n\r\n“Not exactly, Queen Galaxa,” said I with low obeisance, “yet he can\r\nunderstand me and I him.”\r\n\r\n“He is quite harmless, is he not?” asked the queen.\r\n\r\nYou may try to imagine how I felt, dear friends, when as I was about to\r\nsay, “Perfectly so, royal lady,” to my amazement I saw Bulger advance\r\nand sniff at the Princess Crystallina and then draw back and show his\r\nteeth as she stretched out her hand to caress him.\r\n\r\nBending over him I reproved him in a whisper, and bade him kneel before\r\nthe queen. This he proceeded to do, saluting her with three very stately\r\nbows, at which everybody laughed heartily.\r\n\r\n“I would have him come nearer,” said the queen, “so that I may lay my\r\nhand upon him.”\r\n\r\nAt a sign from me Bulger began to lick his fore-paws very carefully, and\r\nthen having wiped them on the rug, sprang up the steps of the throne and\r\nplaced his front feet upon Queen Galaxa’s lap.\r\n\r\nThe fair ruler of the Mikkamenkies was delighted with this sample of\r\nBulger’s fine manners, and in order to amuse her still further I\r\nproceeded to put Bulger through many of his quaint tricks and curious\r\nfeats, bidding him “say his prayers,” “feign death,” “weep for his\r\nsweetheart,” “count ten,” “walk upright,” “go lame and cry to tell how\r\nit hurts.”\r\n\r\nScarcely had he gone half around the circle, feigning lameness, when the\r\ndamozel Glow Stone began to weep herself, and stooping down commenced to\r\ncaress Bulger and to kiss his lame foot, caresses which, to my more than\r\nsurprise, Bulger was not slow in returning, and later too when I bade\r\nhim choose the maiden he loved best and kiss her hand, he bounded\r\nstraight toward Glow Stone and bestowed not one but twenty kisses upon\r\nher outstretched hands, while the princess Crystallina shrank away in\r\nfear and disgust from the “ugly beast,” as she termed him.\r\n\r\n“Bid him bring my handkerchief to me, little baron,” cried Galaxa,\r\nthrowing it on the floor. I did as the queen commanded, but Bulger\r\nrefused to obey.\r\n\r\n“Thou seest, Queen Galaxa,” said I with a low bow, “he refuses to lift\r\nthe handkerchief without a command from thy royal self,” which delicate\r\ncompliment pleased the lady mightily.\r\n\r\n“How comes it, little baron,” she asked, “that thou shouldst be of noble\r\nlineage and thy brother, as thou callest him, plain Bulger?”\r\n\r\n“It comes, royal lady,” said I right humbly, “as it often comes in the\r\nworld which I inhabit, that honors go to them that least deserve them.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then, little baron,” cried Galaxa gayly, “though I be but a petty\r\nsovereign compared with thine, yet may small rulers do acts of great\r\njustice. Bid thy four-footed brother kneel before us.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PRINCESS CRYSTALLINA UNCOVERS HER HEART.]\r\n\r\nAt a word from me, Bulger prostrated himself on the steps of Galaxa’s\r\ncrystal throne, and laid his head at her very feet.\r\n\r\nLeaning forward she touched him lightly with her golden wand, and\r\nexclaimed, “Rise, Lord Bulger, rise! Queen Galaxa seated on her crystal\r\nthrone bids Lord Bulger rise!”\r\n\r\nIn an instant Bulger raised himself on his hind feet and laid his head\r\nin the queen’s lap, while the whole room rang with loud huzzas, and\r\nevery lady gently clapped her frail and glass-like hands, save the\r\nprincess Crystallina who feigned to be asleep.\r\n\r\nQueen Galaxa now undid a string of pearls from her neck and tied them\r\nwith her own hands around Lord Bulger’s—and so it was that my\r\nfour-footed brother ceased to be plain Bulger. Then turning to her\r\ncounsellors of state, Queen Galaxa bade them assign a royal apartment to\r\nLord Bulger and me, and gave strict orders that the severest punishment\r\nbe at once visited upon any Mikkamenky who should dare to laugh at us or\r\nto make disrespectful remarks concerning our dark eyes and skins and\r\nweather-beaten appearance, for, as the royal lady said to her people,\r\n“Ye might look worse than they were ye compelled to live on the outside\r\ninstead of the inside of the world, exposed to biting blasts, piercing\r\ncold, and clouds of suffocating dust.”\r\n\r\nBy the queen’s orders three of the wisest of the Mikkamenkies were\r\nselected to attend Bulger and me, look after our wants, explain\r\neverything to us—in a word, do all in their power to make our stay in\r\nGoggle Land as pleasant as possible.\r\n\r\nTheir names, as nearly as I can translate them, were Doctor Nebulosus,\r\nSir Amber O’Pake, and Lord Cornucore. I should explain to you, dear\r\nfriends, the meaning of these names, for you might be inclined to think\r\nthat Doctor Somewhat Cloudy, Sir Clear-as-Amber; and Lord Heart-of-Horn\r\nmight indicate that they were more or less muddled in their intellects.\r\nFar from it: I have already stated to you they were three of the very\r\nwisest men in the Land of the Transparent Folk, and the lack of\r\nclearness indicated by their names had reference solely to their eyes.\r\n\r\nNow, as you know, the learned men of our upper world have a different\r\nlook from ordinary folk. They are stoop-shouldered, shaggy-eyebrowed,\r\nlong-haired, pursed-lipped, near-sighted, shambling-gaited. Well, the\r\nonly effect that long years of deep study had upon the Mikkamenkies was\r\nto rob their beautiful crystal-like eyes of more or less of their\r\nclearness.\r\n\r\nNow I think you’ll understand why these three learned Mikkamenkies were\r\nnamed as they were.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, they were, in spite of their strange names, three most\r\ncharming gentlemen; and no matter how many times I might ask the same\r\nquestion over again, they were always ready with an answer quite as\r\npolite as the one first given me. They did everything that I had a right\r\npossibly to expect them to do. Indeed, there was but one single thing\r\nwhich I would have fain had them do, and that was to let me look through\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThis they most carefully avoided doing; and no matter how warmed up they\r\nmight become in their descriptions, and no matter how on the alert I was\r\nto catch the coveted peep, the inevitable black fan was always in the\r\nway.\r\n\r\nNaturally, not only they, but all the Transparent Folk, felt a\r\nrepugnance to have a perfect stranger look through them, and I couldn’t\r\nblame them for it either. I despaired of ever getting a chance of seeing\r\na human heart beating away for dear life, for all the world just like\r\nthe swing of a pendulum or the vibration of a balance wheel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER X\r\n\r\n  A BRIEF ACCOUNT OF MY CONVERSATIONS WITH DOCTOR NEBULOSUS, SIR AMBER\r\n    O’PAKE, AND LORD CORNUCORE, WHO TELL ME MANY THINGS THAT I NEVER\r\n    KNEW BEFORE, FOR WHICH I WAS VERY GRATEFUL.\r\n\r\n\r\nLord Bulger and I were more than pleased with our new friends, Doctor\r\nNebulosus, Sir Amber O’Pake, and Lord Cornucore, although so eager were\r\nthey to make us thoroughly comfortable, that they overdid the matter at\r\ntimes, and left me scarcely a moment to myself in which to make an entry\r\nin my notebook. They were extremely solicitous lest in my ignorance I\r\nshould set down something wrong about them.\r\n\r\n“For,” said Sir Amber O’Pake, “now that thou hast found the way to this\r\nunder world of ours, little baron, I feel assured that we shall have a\r\nnumber of visitors from thy people every year or so, and I have already\r\nissued orders to have extra beds made as soon as the wood can be\r\nquarried.”\r\n\r\nDoctor Nebulosus gave me a very interesting account of the various\r\nailments which the Mikkamenkies suffer from. “All sickness among our\r\npeople, little baron,” said he, “is purely mental or emotional; that is,\r\nof the mind or feelings. There is no such thing as bodily infirmity\r\namong us. Wine and strong drink are unknown in our world, and the food\r\nwe eat is light and easily digested. We are never exposed to the danger\r\nof breathing a dust-laden atmosphere, and while we are an active and\r\nindustrious people, yet we sleep a great deal; for, as our laws forbid\r\nthe use of lamps or torches, except for the use of those toiling in the\r\ndark chambers, it is not possible for us to ruin our health by turning\r\nnight into day. We go to bed the very moment the River of Light ceases\r\nto flow. The only ailment that ever gives me the least trouble is\r\n_iburyufrosnia_.”\r\n\r\n“Pray, what is the nature of that ailment?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“It is an inclination to be too happy,” replied Doctor Nebulosus\r\ngravely, “and I regret to say that several of our people attacked with\r\nthis ailment have shortened their lives by refusing to take my remedies.\r\nIt usually develops very slowly, beginning with an inclination to\r\ngiggle, which, after a while, is succeeded by violent fits of laughter.\r\n\r\n“For instance, little baron, when thou camest among us, many of our\r\npeople were attacked with a violent form of _iburyufrosnia_; and\r\nalthough Master Cold Soul, the Court Depressor, made great efforts to\r\ncheck it, yet he was quite powerless to do so. It spread over the city\r\nwith remarkable rapidity. Without knowing why, our workmen at their\r\nwork, our children at their play, our people in doors and out, began to\r\nlaugh and to be dangerously happy. I made examinations of several of the\r\nworst cases, and discovered that at the rate they were beating the\r\nhearts of most of them would run down in a single week. It was terrible.\r\nA council was hastily held, and it was determined to conceal thee and\r\nLord Bulger from the public view, but happily my skill got the upper\r\nhand of the attack.”\r\n\r\n“Didst increase the number of pills to be taken?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“No, little baron,” said Doctor Nebulosus; “I increased their size and\r\ncovered them with a dry powder, which made them extremely difficult to\r\nswallow, and in this way compelled those taking them to cease their\r\nlaughing. But there were a number of cases so violent that they could\r\nnot be cured in this way. These I ordered to be strapped in at the waist\r\nwith broad belts, and to have their mouths held pried open with wooden\r\nwedges. As thou mayst understand, this made laughing so difficult that\r\nthey speedily gave it up altogether.\r\n\r\n“Ah, little baron,” continued the wise doctor with a sigh, “that was a\r\nsorry day for the human race when it learned how to laugh. It is my\r\nopinion that we owe this useless agitation of our bodies to you people\r\nof the upper world. Exposed as ye were to piercing winds and biting\r\nfrosts, ye contracted the habit of shivering to keep warm, and, little\r\nby little, this shivering habit so grew upon you, that ye kept up the\r\nshivering whether ye were cold or not; only ye called it by another\r\nname. Now, my knowledge of the human body teaches me that this quivering\r\nof the flesh is a very wise provision of nature to keep the blood in\r\nmotion, and in this way to save the human body from perishing from the\r\ncold; but why should we quiver when we are happy, little baron? All\r\npleasure is the thought, and yet at the very moment when we should keep\r\nour bodies in as perfect repose as possible, we begin this ridiculous\r\nshivering. Do we shiver when we look upon the beauties of the River of\r\nLight, or listen to sweet music, or gaze upon the loving countenance of\r\nour gracious Queen Galaxa? But worse than all, little baron, this\r\nsenseless quivering and shivering which we call laughter, unlike good,\r\ndeep, long-drawn, wholesome sighs, empty the lungs of air without\r\nfilling them again, and thus do we often see these gigglers and laughers\r\nfall over in fainting fits, absolutely choked by their own wild and\r\nunreasoning action. I have always contended, little baron, that we alone\r\nof all animals had the laughing habit, and I am now delighted to have my\r\nopinion confirmed by my acquaintance with the wise and dignified Lord\r\nBulger. Observe him. He knows quite as well as we what it is to be\r\npleased, to be amused, to be delighted, but he doesn’t think it\r\nnecessary to have recourse to fits of shivering and shuddering. Through\r\nthe brightened eye—true window of the soul—I can see how happy he is. I\r\ncan measure his joy; I can take note of his contentment.”\r\n\r\nI was delighted with this learned discourse of the gentle Doctor\r\nNebulosus, and made notes of it lest the points of his argument might\r\nescape my memory, the more pleased was I in that he proved my faithful\r\nBulger to be so wisely constructed and regulated by nature.\r\n\r\nI made particular inquiry of my friends, Sir Amber O’Pake and Lord\r\nCornucore, as to whether Queen Galaxa ever had any trouble in governing\r\nher people.\r\n\r\n“None whatever,” was the answer. “In many a long year has it only been\r\nnecessary on one or two occasions to summon a Mikkamenky before the\r\nmagistrate and examine his heart under a strong light. The only\r\npunishment allowed by our laws is confinement for a shorter or longer\r\ntime in one of the dark chambers. The severest sentence ever known to\r\nhave been passed by one of our magistrates was twelve hours in length.\r\nBut in all honesty, we must admit, little baron, that falsehood and\r\ndeception are unknown amongst us for the simple reason that, being\r\ntransparent, it is impossible for a Mikkamenky to deceive a brother\r\nwithout being caught in the act. Therefore why make the attempt? The\r\nvery moment one of us begins to say one thing while he is thinking\r\nanother, his eyes cloud up and betray him, just as the crystal-clear\r\nweather glass clouds up at the approach of a storm in the upper world.\r\nBut this, of course, little baron, is only true of our thoughts. Our\r\nlaws allow us to hide our feelings by the use of the black fan. No one\r\nmay look upon another’s heart unless its owner wills it. It is a very\r\ngrave offence for one Mikkamenky to look through another without that\r\none’s permission. But as thou wilt readily understand, inasmuch as we\r\nare by nature transparent, it is utterly impossible for a marriage to\r\nprove an unhappy one, for the reason that when a youth declares his love\r\nfor a maiden, they both have the right by law to look upon each other’s\r\nhearts, and in this way they can tell exactly the strength of the love\r\nthey have for each other.” This and many other strange and interesting\r\nthings did my new friends, Doctor Nebulosus, Sir Amber O’Pake, and Lord\r\nCornucore impart unto me, and right grateful was I to good Queen Galaxa\r\nfor having chosen them for me. Good friends are better than gold,\r\nalthough we may not think it at the time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n  PLEASANT DAYS PASSED AMONG THE MIKKAMENKIES, AND WONDERFUL THINGS\r\n    SEEN BY US.—THE SPECTRAL GARDEN, AND A DESCRIPTION OF IT.—OUR\r\n    MEETING WITH DAMOZEL GLOW STONE, AND WHAT CAME OF IT.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom now on Lord Bulger and I made ourselves perfectly at home among the\r\nMikkamenkies. One of the royal barges was placed at our disposal, and\r\nwhen we grew tired of walking about and gazing at the wonders of this\r\nbeautiful city of the under world, we stepped aboard our barge and were\r\nrowed hither and thither on the glassy river; and if I had not seen it\r\nmyself I never would have believed that any kind of shellfish could ever\r\nbe taught to be so obliging as to swim to the surface and offer one of\r\ntheir huge claws for our dinner, politely dropping it in our hand the\r\nmoment we had laid hold of it. On one of the river banks I noticed a\r\nlong row of wooden compartments looking very much like a grocer’s bins;\r\nbut you may think how amused Bulger and I were upon coming closer to\r\nthis long row of little houses to find that they were turtle nests, and\r\nthat quite a number of the turtles were sitting comfortably in their\r\nnests busy laying their eggs—which, let me assure you, were the most\r\ndainty tidbits I ever tasted.\r\n\r\nI think I informed you that the river flowing through Goggle Land was\r\nfairly swarming with delicious fish, the carp and sole being\r\nparticularly delicate in flavor; and knowing, as I did, what a\r\ntender-hearted folk the Mikkamenkies are, I had been not a little\r\npuzzled in my mind as to how they had ever been able to summon up\r\ncourage enough to drive a spear into one of these fish, which were as\r\ntame and playful as a lot of kittens or puppies, and followed our barge\r\nhither and thither, snapping up the food we tossed to them, and leaping\r\ninto the air, where they glistened like burnished silver as the white\r\nlight sparkled on their scales.\r\n\r\nBut the mystery was solved one day when I saw one of the fishermen\r\ndecoying a score or more of fish into a sort of pen shut off from the\r\nriver by a wire netting. Scarcely had he closed the gates when, to my\r\namazement, I saw the fish one after the other come to the surface and\r\nfloat about on their sides, stone dead.\r\n\r\n“This, little baron,” explained the man in charge, “is the death\r\nchamber. Hidden at the bottom of this dark pool lie several electric\r\neels of great size and power, and when our people want a fresh supper of\r\nfish we simply open these gates and decoy a shoal of them inside by\r\ntossing their favorite food into the water. The executioners are\r\nawaiting them, and in a few instants the fish, while enjoying their\r\nrepast and suspecting no harm, are painlessly put to death, as thou hast\r\nseen.”\r\n\r\nOne part of the city of the Transparent Folk which attracted Bulger and\r\nme very much was the royal gardens. It was a weird and uncanny place,\r\nand upon my first visit I walked through its paths and beneath its\r\narbors upon my toes and with bated breath, as you might steal into some\r\nbit of fairy-land, looking anxiously from side to side as if at every\r\nstep you expected some sprite or goblin to trip you up with a tough\r\nspider-web, or brush your cheeks with their cold and satiny wings.\r\n\r\nNow, dear friends, you must first be told that with the loss of sunshine\r\nand the open air, the flowers and shrubs and vines of this underground\r\nworld gradually parted with their perfumes and colors, their leaves and\r\npetals and stems and tendrils growing paler and paler in hue, like\r\nlovelorn maids whose sweethearts had never come back from the war. Month\r\nby month the dark greens, the blush pinks, the golden yellows, and the\r\ndeep blues pined away, longing for the lost sunshine and the wooing\r\nbreeze they loved so dearly, until at last the transformation was\r\ncomplete, and there they all stood or hung bleached to utter whiteness,\r\nlike those fantastic clumps of flowers and wreaths of vines which the\r\nfeathery snow of April builds in the leafless shrubs and trees.\r\n\r\nI cannot tell you, dear friends, what a strange feeling came over me as\r\nI stepped within this spectral garden where ghost-like vines clung in\r\nfantastic forms and figures to the dark trellises, and where tall\r\nlilies, whiter than the down of eider, stood bolt upright like spirits\r\ndoomed to eternal silence, denied even the speech of perfume, and where\r\nhuge clusters of snowy chrysanthemums, fluffy feathery forms, seemed\r\npressing their soft bodies together like groups of banished celestials\r\nin a sort of silent despair as they felt the warmth and glow of sunlight\r\nslowly and gradually quitting their souls; where lower down, great roses\r\nwith snowy petals whiter than the sea-shells hung motionless, bursting\r\nopen with eager effort, as if listening for some signal that would\r\ndissolve the spell put upon them, and give them back the sunshine, and\r\nwith it their color and their perfume; where lower still beds of violets\r\nbleached white as fleecy clouds seemed wrapt in silent sorrow at loss of\r\nthe heavenly perfume which had been theirs on earth; where, above the\r\nlilies’ heads shot long, slender, spectral stalks of sunflowers almost\r\ninvisible, loaded at their ends with clusters of snowy flowers thus\r\nsuspended like white faces looking down through the silent air, and\r\nwaiting, waiting for the sunshine that never came; and higher still all\r\nover and above these spectral flowers, intwining and inwrapping and\r\nfalling festoon and garland-wise, crept and ran like unto long lines of\r\nescaping phantoms, ghostly vines with ghostly blossoms, bent and twisted\r\nand wrapped and coiled into a thousand strange and fantastic forms and\r\nfigures which the white light with its inky shadows made alive and half\r\nhuman, so that movement and voice alone were needful to make this garden\r\nseem peopled with sorrowing sprites banished to these subterranean\r\nchambers for strange misdeeds done on earth and condemned to wait ten\r\nthousand years ere sunlight and their color and their perfume should be\r\ngiven back to them again.\r\n\r\nWhile strolling through the royal gardens one day, Bulger suddenly gave\r\na low cry and bounded on ahead, as if his eyes had fallen upon the\r\nfamiliar form of some dear friend.\r\n\r\nWhen I came up with him he was crouching beside the damozel Glow Stone\r\nwho, seated on one of the garden benches, was caressing Bulger’s head\r\nand ears with one of her soft hands with its filmy-like skin, while the\r\nother held its black fan pressed tightly against her bosom.\r\n\r\nShe looked up at me with her crystal eyes, and smiled faintly as I drew\r\nnear.\r\n\r\n“Thou seest, little baron,” she murmured, “Lord Bulger and I have not\r\nforgotten each other.” Since our presentation at court I had been going\r\nthrough and through my mind in search of some reason for Bulger’s sudden\r\naffection for damozel Glow Stone, but had found none.\r\n\r\nI was the more perplexed as she was but the maid of honor, while the\r\nfair princess Crystallina sat on the very steps of the throne.\r\n\r\nBut I said nothing save to reply that I was greatly pleased to see it\r\nand to add that where Bulger’s love went, mine was sure to follow.\r\n\r\n“Oh, little baron, if I could but believe that!” sighed the fair\r\ndamozel.\r\n\r\n“Thou mayst,” said I, “indeed thou mayst.”\r\n\r\n“Then, if I may, little baron,” she replied, “I will, and prithee come\r\nand sit beside me here, only till I bid thee, look not through me. Dost\r\npromise?”\r\n\r\n“I do, fair damozel,” was my answer.\r\n\r\n“And thou, Lord Bulger, lie there at my feet,” she continued, “and keep\r\nthy wise eyes fixed upon me and thy keen ears wide open.”\r\n\r\n“Little baron, if both thine and our worlds were filled with sorrowing\r\nhearts, mine would be the heaviest of them all. List! oh, list to the\r\nsad, sad tale of the sorrowing maid with the speck in her heart, and,\r\nwhen thou knowest all, give me of thy wisdom.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CRYSTALLINA’S HEART ON A SCREEN.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n  THE SAD, SAD TALE OF THE SORROWING PRINCESS WITH A SPECK IN HER\r\n    HEART, AND WHAT ALL HAPPENED WHEN SHE HAD ENDED IT, WHICH THE\r\n    READER MUST READ FOR HIMSELF IF HE WOULD KNOW.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Little baron and dear Lord Bulger,” began the crystal-eyed damozel,\r\nafter she had eased her soul of its load of woe by three long and deep,\r\ndeep sighs, “know then that I am not the damozel Glow Stone, but none\r\nother than the royal princess Crystallina herself; that she whose hair I\r\ncomb should comb mine; that she whom I have served for ten long years\r\nshould have served me!”\r\n\r\n“And to think, O princess,” I burst out joyfully, “that my beloved\r\nBulger should have been the first to discover that she who was seated on\r\nthe steps of the crystal throne was not entitled to the seat; to think\r\nthat his subtle intellect should have been the first to scent out the\r\nwrong that had been done thee; his keen eye the first to go to the\r\nbottom of truth’s well; but, fair princess, I am bursting with\r\nimpatience to know how thou thyself didst ever discover the wrong that\r\nhas been done thee.”\r\n\r\n“That thou shalt speedily know, little baron,” answered Crystallina,\r\n“and that thou mayst know all that I know I’ll begin at the very\r\nbeginning: The day I was born there was great rejoicing in the land of\r\nthe Mikkamenkies, and the people gathered in front of the royal palace\r\nand laughed and cried by turns, so happy were they to think they were to\r\nbe governed by another princess after Queen Galaxa’s heart should run\r\ndown; for, many years ago, a bad king had made them very unhappy, and\r\nthey had hoped and prayed that no more such would come to reign over\r\nthem. And pretty soon one of them began to tell the others what he\r\nthought the little princess would be like.\r\n\r\n“‘She will be the fairest that ever sat upon the crystal throne. Her\r\nhands and feet will be like pearls tipped with coral; her hair whiter\r\nthan the river’s foam; and from her beautiful eyes will burst the\r\nradiance of her pure soul, and her heart, Oh, her heart will be like a\r\nlittle lump of frozen water so clear and so transparent will it be, so\r\nlike a bit of purest crystal, bright and flawless as a diamond of the\r\nfirst water, and therefore let her be called the princess Crystallina,\r\nor the Maid with the Crystal Heart.’\r\n\r\n“Forthwith the cry went up: ‘Ay, let her be called Crystallina, or the\r\nMaid with the Crystal Heart,’ and Queen Galaxa heard the cry of her\r\npeople and sent them word that it should be as they wished—that I should\r\nbe the Princess Crystallina.\r\n\r\n“But, ah me, that I should have lived to tell it! after a few days the\r\nnurse came to my royal mother wringing her hands and pouring down a\r\nflood of tears.\r\n\r\n“Throwing herself on her knees, she whispered to the queen, ‘Royal\r\nmistress, bid me die rather than tell thee what I know.’\r\n\r\n“Being ordered to speak, the nurse informed Queen Galaxa that she had\r\nthat day for the first time held me up to the light and had discovered\r\nthat there was a speck in my heart.\r\n\r\n“The queen uttered a cry of horror and swooned. When she came to herself\r\nshe directed that I should be brought to her and held up to the light so\r\nthat she might see for herself. Alas, too true! there was the speck in\r\nmy heart sure enough. I was not worthy of the sweet name which her\r\nloving people had bestowed upon me. They would turn from me with horror;\r\nthey would never consent to have me for their queen when the truth\r\nshould become known. They would not be moved by a mother’s prayers: they\r\nwould turn a deaf ear to every one who should be bold enough to advise\r\nthem to accept a princess with a speck in her heart, when they had\r\nthought they were getting one well deserving of the title they had\r\nbestowed upon her.\r\n\r\n“Queen Galaxa knew that something must be done at once; that it would be\r\ntime and labor lost to attempt to reason with the disappointed people,\r\nso she set to work thinking up some way out of her trouble. Now, it so\r\nhappened, little baron, that the very day I had come into the world a\r\nbabe had been born to one of Queen Galaxa’s serving women; and so\r\nhastily summoning the woman she ordered her to bring her babe into the\r\nroyal bed-chamber and leave it there, promising that it should be\r\nbrought up as my foster-sister. But no sooner had the serving woman gone\r\nher way rejoicing than the nurse was ordered to change the children in\r\nthe cradle, and in a few moments Glow Stone was wrapt in my richly\r\nembroidered blanket and I swathed up in her plain coverlets.\r\n\r\n“How things went for several years I know not, but one day, ah, how well\r\nI recollect it! my little mind was puzzled by hearing Crystallina cry\r\nout: ‘Nay, nay, dear mamma, ’tis not fair; I like it not. Each day when\r\nthou comest to us thou givest Glow Stone ten kisses and me but a single\r\none.’ Then would Queen Galaxa smile a sad smile and bestow some bauble\r\nupon Crystallina to coax her back to contentment again.\r\n\r\n“And so we went on, Crystallina and I, from one year to another until we\r\nwere little maids well grown, and she sat on the throne and wore royal\r\npurple stitched with gold, and I plain white; but still most of the\r\nkisses fell to my share. And I marvelled not a little at it, but dared\r\nnot ask why it was. However, once when I was alone with Queen Galaxa,\r\nseated on my cushion in the corner plying my needle and thinking of the\r\nsail we were to have on the river that day, suddenly I was startled to\r\nsee the queen throw herself on her knees in front of me, and to feel her\r\nclasp me in her arms and cover my face and head with tears and kisses,\r\nas she sobbed and moaned,—\r\n\r\n“‘O my babe, my lost babe, my blessing and my joy, wilt never, never,\r\nnever come back to me? Art gone forever? Must I give thee up, oh, must\r\nI?’”\r\n\r\n“‘Nay, Royal Lady,’ I stammered in my more than wonder at her words and\r\nactions. ‘Thou art in a dream. Awake, and see clearly; I am not\r\nCrystallina. I am Glow Stone, thy foster-child. I’ll hie me straight and\r\nbring my royal sister to thee.’\r\n\r\n“But she would not let me loose, and for all answer showered more kisses\r\non me till I was well-nigh smothered, so tight she held me pressed\r\nagainst her bosom, while around and over me her long thick tresses fell\r\nlike a woven mantle.\r\n\r\n“And then she told me all—all that I have told thee, little baron, and\r\ncharged me never to impart it unto any soul in Goggle Land; and I made a\r\nsolemn promise unto her that I never would.”\r\n\r\n“And thou hast kept thy word like a true princess as thou art,” said I\r\ncheerily, “for I am not of thy world, fair Crystallina.”\r\n\r\n“Now that I have told thee the sad tale of the sorrowing princess with\r\nthe speck in her heart, little baron,” murmured Crystallina, fixing her\r\nlarge and radiant eyes upon me, “there is but one thing more for me to\r\ndo, and it is to let thee look through me, so that thou mayst know\r\nexactly what counsel to give.” And so saying the fair princess rose from\r\nher seat, and having placed herself in front of me with a flood of white\r\nlight falling full upon her back, she lowered her black fan and bade me\r\ngaze upon the heavy heart which she had carried about with her all these\r\nyears, and tell her exactly how large the speck was and where it lay,\r\nand what color it was.\r\n\r\nI was overjoyed to get an opportunity at last to look through one of the\r\nMikkamenkies, and my own heart bounded with satisfaction as I looked and\r\nlooked upon that mysterious little thing, nay, rather a tiny being,\r\nliving, breathing, palpitating within her breast; now slow and measured\r\nas she dwelt in thought upon her sad fate, now beating faster and faster\r\nas the hope bubbled up in her mind that possibly I might be able to\r\ncounsel her so wisely that an end would come to all her sorrow.\r\n\r\n“Well, wise little baron,” she murmured anxiously, “what seest thou? Is\r\nit very large? In what part is it? Is it black as night or some color\r\nless fatal?”\r\n\r\n“Take courage, fair princess,” said I, “it is very small and lies just\r\nbeneath the bow on the left side. Nor is it black, but reddish rather,\r\nas if a single drop of blood from the veins of thy far distant ancestors\r\nhad outlived them these thousands of years and hardened there to tell\r\nwhence thy people came.” The princess wept tears of joy upon hearing\r\nthese comforting words.\r\n\r\n“If it had been black,” she whispered “I would have lain me down in this\r\nbed of violets and never risen more till my people had come to bear me\r\nto my grave in the silent burial chamber—unvisited by the River of\r\nLight.”\r\n\r\nAt this sad outbreak Bulger whined piteously and licked the princess’s\r\nhands as he looked up at her with his dark eyes radiant with sympathy.\r\n\r\nShe was greatly cheered by this message of comfort, and it moved me,\r\ntoo, by its heartiness.\r\n\r\n“List, fair princess,” said I gravely. “I own the task is not a light\r\none, but hope for the best. I would that we had more time, but as thou\r\nknowest Queen Galaxa’s heart will soon run down, therefore must we act\r\nwith despatch as well as wisdom. But first of all must I speak with the\r\nqueen and gain her consent to act for thee in this matter.”\r\n\r\n“That, I fear me, she will never grant,” moaned Crystallina. “However,\r\nthou art so much wiser than I—do as best seems to thee.”\r\n\r\n“The next thing to be done, fair princess,” I added solemnly, “is to\r\nshow thy heart boldly and fearlessly to thy people.”\r\n\r\n“Nay, little baron,” she exclaimed, rising to her feet, “that may not\r\nbe, that may not be, for know that our law doth make it treason itself\r\nfor one of our people to look through a person of royal blood. Oh, no,\r\noh, no, little baron, that may never be!”\r\n\r\n“Stay, sweet princess,” I urged in gentlest tones, “not so fast. Thou\r\ndost not know what I mean by showing thy heart boldly to thy people.\r\nNever fear. I will not break the law of the land, and yet they shall\r\nlook upon the speck within thy heart, and see how small it is and hear\r\nwhat I have to say about it, and thou shalt not even be visible to\r\nthem.”\r\n\r\n“O little baron,” murmured Crystallina, “if this may only be! I feel\r\nthey will forgive me. Thou art so wise and thy words carry such strong\r\nhope to my poor, heavy heart that I almost”—\r\n\r\n“Nay, fair princess,” I interrupted, “hope for the best, no more. I am\r\nnot wise enough to read the future, and from what I know of thy people\r\nthey seem but little different from mine own. Perchance I may be able to\r\nsway them toward my views, and make them cry, ‘Long live princess\r\nCrystallina!’ but I can only promise thee to do my best. Betake thee now\r\nto the palace, and scorn not for yet a day or so to take up the golden\r\ncomb and play the damozel Glow Stone in all humility.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n  HOW I SET TO WORK TO UNDO A WRONG THAT HAD BEEN DONE IN THE KINGDOM\r\n    OF THE MIKKAMENKIES, AND HOW BULGER HELPED.—QUEEN GALAXA’S\r\n    CONFESSION.—I AM CREATED PRIME MINISTER AS LONG AS SHE LIVES.—WHAT\r\n    TOOK PLACE IN THE THRONE ROOM.—MY SPEECH TO THE MEN OF GOGGLE LAND\r\n    AFTER WHICH I SHOW THEM SOMETHING WORTH SEEING.—HOW I WAS PULLED\r\n    IN TWO DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS AND WHAT CAME OF IT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first thing I did after the genuine princess Crystallina had left me\r\nwas to seek out Doctor Nebulosus and learn from him the exact number of\r\nhours before the queen’s heart would run down.\r\n\r\nAs he had just been making an examination, he was able to tell the very\r\nminute: it was seventeen hours and thirteen minutes, rather a short time\r\nyou must confess, dear friends, in which to accomplish such an important\r\npiece of business as I had in mind. I then made my way directly to the\r\nroyal palace and demanded a private audience with the Lady of the\r\nCrystal Throne.\r\n\r\nWith the advice of Sir Amber O’Pake and Lord Cornucore she firmly but\r\ngraciously refused to receive me, giving as an excuse that the\r\nexcitement that would be sure to follow an interview with the “Man of\r\nCoal”—so the Mikkamenkies had named me—would shorten her life at least\r\nthirteen minutes.\r\n\r\nBut I was not to be put off in so unceremonious a manner. Sitting down,\r\nI seized a pen and wrote the following words upon a piece of glazed\r\nsilk:—\r\n\r\n“_To Galaxa, Queen of the Mikkamenkies, Lady of the Crystal Throne._\r\n\r\n“I, Lord Bulger, a Mikkamenkian Noble, Bearer of this, who was the first\r\nto discover that the real princess was not sitting on the steps of the\r\nCrystal Throne, demand an audience for my Master Baron Sebastian von\r\nTroomp, commonly known as ‘Little Baron Trump,’ and prompted by him I\r\nask, What are thirteen minutes of thy life, O Queen Galaxa, to the long\r\nyears of sorrow and disappointment in store for thy royal child?”\r\n\r\nTaking this letter in his mouth, Bulger sprang away with long and rapid\r\nbounds. In a few minutes he was in the presence of the queen, for the\r\nguards had fallen back affrighted as they saw him draw near with his\r\ndark eyes flashing indignation. Raising himself upon his hind feet, he\r\nlaid the letter in Galaxa’s hands. The moment she had read it she fell\r\ninto a swoon, and all was stir and commotion in and round about the\r\npalace. I was hastily summoned and the audience chamber cleared of every\r\nattendant save Doctor Nebulosus, Sir Amber O’Pake, Lord Cornucore, Lord\r\nBulger, and me.\r\n\r\n“Send for the damozel Glow Stone,” commanded the queen, and when she had\r\nappeared, to the amazement of all saving Bulger and me, Galaxa bade her\r\nmount the steps of the Crystal Throne, then, having embraced her most\r\ntenderly, the queen spoke these words:—\r\n\r\n“O faithful Councillors and wise friends from the upper world, this is\r\nthe real princess Crystallina, whom I have for all these years wickedly\r\nand wrongfully kept from her high state and royal privileges. She was\r\nborn with a speck in her heart, and I feared that it would be useless to\r\nask my people to accept her as my successor.”\r\n\r\n“Ay, Lady of the Crystal Throne,” exclaimed Lord Cornucore, “thou hast\r\nwisely done. Thy people would never have received her as Princess\r\nCrystallina, for, being by the laws of our land denied the privilege to\r\nlook for themselves, they never would have believed that this spot in\r\nthe princess’s heart was but a tiny speck like a single hair crystal in\r\nthe arm of thy magnificent throne. Therefore, O queen, we counsel thee\r\nnot to imbitter thy last hours by differences with thy loving subjects.”\r\n\r\n“My Lord Cornucore,” said I with a low bow, “I make bold to raise my\r\nvoice against thine, and I crave permission from Queen Galaxa to parley\r\nwith her people.”\r\n\r\n“Forbid it, royal lady!” cried Sir Amber O’Pake savagely, at which\r\nBulger gave a low growl and showed his teeth.\r\n\r\n“Queen Galaxa,” I added gravely, “a wrong confessed is half redressed.\r\nThis fair princess, ’tis true, hath a speck in her heart which ill\r\naccords with the name bestowed upon her by thy people. Bid me be master\r\nuntil thy heart runs down, and by the Knighthood of all the Trumps I\r\npromise thee that thou shalt have three hours of happiness ere thy royal\r\nheart has ceased to beat!”\r\n\r\n“Be it so, little baron,” exclaimed Galaxa joyfully. “I proclaim thee\r\nprime minister for the rest of my life.” At these words Bulger broke out\r\ninto a series of glad barks, and, raising upon his hind legs, licked the\r\nqueen’s hand in token of his gratitude, while the fair princess looked a\r\nlove at me that was too deep to put into words.\r\n\r\n“I had now but a few hours to act. The excitement, so Doctor Nebulosus\r\nassured me, would shorten the queen’s life a full hour.”\r\n\r\nIt had always been my custom to carry about with me a small but\r\nexcellent magnifying-glass, a double convex lens, for the purpose of\r\nmaking examinations of minute objects, and also for reading inscriptions\r\ntoo fine to be seen with the naked eye. Hastily summoning a skilful\r\nmetal worker, I instructed him to set the lens in a short tube and to\r\nenclose that tube within another, so that I could lengthen it at my\r\npleasure. Then having called together as many of the head men of the\r\nnation as the throne room would hold, I requested Lord Cornucore to\r\ninform them of the confession which Queen Galaxa had made; namely, that\r\nin reality damozel Glow Stone was princess Crystallina and princess\r\nCrystallina was damozel Glow Stone.\r\n\r\nThey were stricken speechless by this piece of information, but when\r\nLord Cornucore went on to tell the whole story and to explain to them\r\nwhy the queen had practised this deception upon them, they broke out\r\ninto the wildest lamentation, repeating over and over again in piteous\r\ntones,—\r\n\r\n“A speck in her heart! A speck in her heart! O dire misfortune! O woful\r\nday! She never can be our princess if she hath a speck in her heart!” By\r\nthis time my arrangements were complete. I had placed the princess\r\nCrystallina just outside the door of the throne room where she stood\r\nconcealed behind the thick hangings, and near her I had stationed Doctor\r\nNebulosus with a large circular mirror of burnished silver in his hand.\r\nCalling out in a loud voice for silence, I thus addressed the weeping\r\nsubjects of Queen Galaxa:—\r\n\r\n“O Mikkamenkies, Men of Goggle Land, Transparent Folk, I count myself\r\nmost happy to be among you at this hour and to be permitted, by your\r\ngracious queen, to raise my voice in defence of the unfortunate princess\r\nwith the speck in her heart. Being of noble birth and an inhabitant of\r\nanother world, it was lawful for me to look through the sorrowing\r\nprincess, and I have done it. Yes, Mikkamenkies, I have gazed upon her\r\nheart; I have seen the speck within it! Give ear, Men of Goggle Land,\r\nand you shall know how that speck came there; for it is not, as you\r\ndoubtless think, a coal-black spot within that fair enclosure, clearer\r\nthan the columns of Galaxa’s throne. Oh, no, Mikkamenkies, a thousand\r\ntimes no: it is a tiny blemish of reddish hue, a drop of princely blood\r\nfrom the upper world, which I inhabit, and this drop in all these\r\ncountless centuries has coursed through the veins of a thousand kings,\r\nand still kept its roseate glow, still remembered the glorious sunshine\r\nwhich called it into being; and now, Men of Goggle Land, lest you think\r\nthat for some dark purpose of mine own I speak other than the pure and\r\nsober truth, behold, I show you the fair Crystallina’s heart, in its\r\nvery life and being as it is, beating and throbbing with hope and fear\r\ncomingled. Look and judge for yourselves!” And with this I signalled to\r\nthose on the outside of the palace to carry out my instructions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BULGER PARTS HIS MASTER FROM PRINCESS CRYSTALLINA.]\r\n\r\nIn an instant the thick curtains were drawn and the throne room was\r\nwrapped in darkness, and at the same moment Doctor Nebulosus, with his\r\nmirror, caught the strong, white rays of light and threw them upon\r\nCrystallina’s body, while I through an opening in the hangings made\r\nhaste to apply the tube to which the lens had been fitted, and, catching\r\nthe reflected image of her heart, threw it up in plain and startling\r\nview upon the opposite wall of the throne room. Upon seeing how small\r\nthe speck was and how truthfully I had described it, the Mikkamenkies\r\nfell a-weeping for purest joy, and then, as if with one voice, they\r\nburst out,—\r\n\r\n“Long live the fair princess Crystallina with the ruby speck in her\r\nheart! and ten thousand blessings on the head of little Baron Trump and\r\nLord Bulger for saving our land from cruel dissensions!” The people on\r\nthe outside took up the cry, and in a few moments the whole city was\r\nthronged with bands of Queen Galaxa’s subjects, singing and dancing and\r\ntelling of their love for the fair princess with the ruby speck in her\r\nheart. I had kept my word—Queen Galaxa would have at least three hours\r\nof complete happiness ere her heart ran down.\r\n\r\nBut suddenly the River of Light began to flicker and dim its flood of\r\nbrilliant white rays.\r\n\r\nNight was coming. Noiselessly, as if by magic, the Mikkamenkies faded\r\nfrom my sight, stealing away in search of beds, and as the gloom crept\r\ninto the great throne room, some one plucked me gently by the hand and a\r\nsoft voice whispered,—\r\n\r\n“I love! I love thee! Oh, who other than I can tell how I love thee!”\r\nand then a grip stronger than that gentle hand seized me by the skirt of\r\nmy coat and dragged me away slowly, but surely, away, through the\r\ndarkness, through the gloom, out into the silent streets, ever away\r\nuntil at last that soft voice, choking with a sob, ceased its pleading\r\nand gasped, “Farewell, oh, farewell! I dare go no farther!” And so\r\nBulger, in his wisdom, led me on and ever on out of the City of the\r\nMikkamenkies, out upon the Marble Highway!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n  BULGER AND I TURN OUR BACKS ON THE FAIR DOMAIN OF QUEEN\r\n    CRYSTALLINA.—NATURE’S WONDERFUL SPEAKING-TUBE.—CRYSTALLINA’S\r\n    ATTEMPT TO TURN US BACK.—HOW I KEPT BULGER FROM YIELDING.—SOME\r\n    INCIDENTS OF OUR JOURNEY ALONG THE MARBLE HIGHWAY, AND HOW WE CAME\r\n    TO THE GLORIOUS GATEWAY OF SOLID SILVER.\r\n\r\n\r\nMe, the sorrowing Sebastian, loaded with as heavy a heart as ever a\r\nmortal of my size had borne away with him, did the wise Bulger lead\r\nalong the broad and silent highway, farther and yet farther from the\r\ncity of the Mikkamenkies, until at last the music of the fountains\r\npattering in their crystal basins died away in the distance and the\r\ndarkness far behind me. I felt that my wise little brother was right,\r\nand so I followed on after, with not a sigh or a syllable to stay him.\r\n\r\nBut he halted at last, and, as I felt about me, I discovered that I was\r\nstanding beside one of the richly carved seats that one so often meets\r\nwith along the Marble Highway. I was quite as foot-weary as I was\r\nheart-heavy, and reaching out I touched the spring which I knew would\r\ntransform the seat into a bed, and clambering upon it with my wise\r\nBulger nestled beside me, I soon fell into a deep and refreshing sleep.\r\n\r\nWhen I awoke and, sitting up, looked back toward Queen Crystallina’s\r\ncapital, I could see the River of Light pouring down its flood of white\r\nrays far away in the distance; but only a faint reflection came out to\r\nwhere we had passed the night, and then I knew that my faithful\r\ncompanion had led me to the very uttermost limit of the Mikkamenky\r\ndomain before he had halted. Yes, sure enough, for, as I raised my eyes,\r\nthere towering above the bed stood the slender crystal column which\r\nmarked the end of Goggle Land, and upon its face I read the extract from\r\na royal decree forbidding a Mikkamenky to overstep this limit under pain\r\nof incurring the queen’s most serious displeasure.\r\n\r\nBefore me was darkness and uncertainty; behind me lay the fair Kingdom\r\nof the Transparent Folk yet in sight, lighted up like a long line of\r\nhappy homes in which the fires were blazing bright and warm on the\r\nhearthstones.\r\n\r\nDid I turn back? Did I hesitate? No. I could see a pair of speaking eyes\r\nfixed upon me, and could hear a low whine of impatience coaxing me\r\nalong.\r\n\r\nStooping down, I fastened a bit of silken cord taken from the bed to\r\nBulger’s collar and bade him lead the way.\r\n\r\nIt was a long while before the light of Queen Crystallina’s city faded\r\naway entirely, and even when it ceased to be of any service in making\r\nknown to me the grandeur and beauty of the vast underground passage, I\r\ncould still see it glitter like a silver star away, away behind me.\r\n\r\nBut it disappeared at last, and then I felt that I had parted forever\r\nwith the dear little princess with the speck in her heart.\r\n\r\nBulger didn’t seem to have the slightest difficulty in keeping in the\r\ncentre of the Marble Highway, and never allowed the leading string to\r\nslack up for a moment. However, it was by no means a tramp through utter\r\ndarkness, for the lizards of which I have already spoken, aroused by the\r\nsound of my footfalls, snapped their tails and lighted up their tiny\r\nflash torches in eager attempts to discover whence the noise proceeded,\r\nand what sort of a being it was that had invaded their silent domains.\r\nWe had covered possibly two leagues when suddenly a low and mysterious\r\nvoice, as soft and gentle as if it had dropped from the clear, starry\r\nheavens of my own beautiful world, reached my ear.\r\n\r\n“Sebastian! Sebastian!” it murmured. Before I could stop to think, I\r\nuttered a cry of wonder, and the noise of my voice seemed to awaken ten\r\nthousand of the tiny living flash lights inhabiting the cracks and\r\ncrevices of the vast arched corridor, flooding it for a moment or so\r\nwith a soft and roseate radiance.\r\n\r\n“Sebastian! Sebastian!” again murmured the mellow and echo-like voice,\r\ncoming from the very walls of rock beside me.\r\n\r\nHastily drawing near to the spot whence the words seemed to come, I laid\r\nmy ear against the smooth face of the rock. Again the same soft-sighing\r\nvoice pronounced my name so clearly and so close beside me that I\r\nreached out to grasp Crystallina’s hand, for hers was the voice,—the\r\nsame low, sweet voice that had told me of her sorrow in the Spectral\r\nGarden; but there was no one there. In reaching out, however, I had\r\npassed my left hand along the face of the wall, and it had marked the\r\npresence of a round smooth opening in its rocky face, an opening about\r\nthe size of a rain-water pipe in the upper world.\r\n\r\nInstantly it flashed upon my mind that through some whim of nature this\r\nopening extended for leagues back towards the city of the Mikkamenkies\r\nthrough the miles of solid rock, and opened in the very Throne Room of\r\nthe Princess Crystallina.\r\n\r\nYes, I was right, for after a moment or so again the same low, sweet\r\nvoice came through the speaking-tube of nature’s own making and fell\r\nupon my eager ear.\r\n\r\nI waited until it had ceased, and setting my mouth in front of the\r\nopening I murmured in strong but gentle tones,—\r\n\r\n“Farewell, dear Princess Crystallina. Bulger and the little baron both\r\nbid thee a long farewell!” and then raising Bulger in my arms, I bade\r\nhim weep for his royal friend whom he would never see again.\r\n\r\nHe gave a long, low, piteous cry, half-whine, half-howl, and then I\r\nlistened for Crystallina’s voice. It was not long in coming.\r\n\r\n“Farewell, dear Bulger; farewell, dear Sebastian! Crystallina will never\r\nforget you until her poor heart with the speck in it runs down and the\r\nCrystal Throne knows her no more.” Poor Bulger! It now became my turn to\r\ntear him from this spot, for Crystallina’s voice, sounding thus\r\nunexpectedly in his ears, had aroused all the deep affection which he\r\nhad so ruthlessly smothered in order to bring his little master to his\r\nsenses and free him from the charm of Crystallina’s grace and beauty.\r\nBut in vain. All my strength, all my entreaties, were powerless to move\r\nhim from the place.\r\n\r\nEvidently Crystallina had heard me pleading with Bulger and had imagined\r\nthat now I would waver and stand irresolute.\r\n\r\n“Heed dear Bulger’s prayer, O beloved,” she pleaded, “and turn back,\r\nturn back to thy disconsolate Crystallina, whom thou madest so happy for\r\na brief moment! Turn back! Oh, turn back!” Bulger now began to whine and\r\ncry most piteously. I felt that something must be done at once, or the\r\nmost direful consequences might ensue—that Bulger, crazed by the sweet\r\ntones of Crystallina’s voice, might break away from me and dart away in\r\nmad race back to the city of the Mikkamenkies, back to the fair young\r\nqueen of the Crystal Throne.\r\n\r\nIt became necessary for me to resort to trick and artifice to save my\r\ndear little brother from his own loving heart. Drawing his head up\r\nagainst my body and covering his eyes with my left arm, I quickly\r\nunloosened my neckerchief, and thrusting it into this wonderful\r\nspeaking-tube closed it effectively.\r\n\r\nAnd thus I saved my faithful Bulger from himself, thus I closed his ears\r\nto the music of Crystallina’s voice; but it was not until after a good\r\nhour’s waiting that he could bring himself to believe that his beloved\r\nfriend would speak no more.\r\n\r\nAfter several hours more of journeying along the Marble Highway a speck\r\nof light caught my eye, far on ahead, and I redoubled my pace to reach\r\nit quickly. I was soon rewarded for my trouble by entering a wonderful\r\nchamber, circular in form, with a domed roof. In the centre of this fair\r\ntemple of the underground world sprang a glorious fountain with a mighty\r\nrush of waters which brought with them such a phosphorescence that this\r\nvast round chamber was lighted up with a pale yellow light in which the\r\ncountless crystals of the roof and sides sparkled magnificently.\r\n\r\nHere we passed the night, or what I called the night, refreshing\r\nourselves with food which I had brought from the Kingdom of the\r\nMikkamenkies, and drinking and bathing in the wonderful fountain which\r\nleaped into the air with a rush and a whir, and filled it with a strange\r\nand fitful radiance. Upon awaking both Bulger and I felt greatly\r\nrefreshed both in body and mind, and we made haste to seek out the lofty\r\nportal opening upon the Marble Highway, and were soon trudging along it\r\nagain. Hour after hour we kept on our feet, for something told me that\r\nwe could not be far away from the confines of some other domain of this\r\nWorld within a World; and this inward prompting of mine proved to be\r\ncorrect, for Bulger suddenly gave a joyful bark and began to caper about\r\nas much as to say,—\r\n\r\n“O little master, if thou only hadst my keen scent, thou wouldst know\r\nthat we are drawing near to human habitations of some kind!”\r\n\r\nSure enough, in a few moments a faint light came creeping in beneath the\r\nmighty arches of the broad corridor, and every instant it gathered in\r\nstrength until now I could see clearly about me, and then all of a\r\nsudden I caught sight of the source of this shy and unsteady light.\r\nThere in front of me towered two gigantic candelabra of carved and\r\nchased and polished silver, both crowned with a hundred lights, one on\r\neach side of the Marble Highway—not the dull, soft flames of oil or wax,\r\nbut the white tongues of fire produced by ignited gas escaping from the\r\nchemist’s retort.\r\n\r\nIt was marvellous, it was magnificent, and I stood looking up at these\r\ngreat clusters of tongues of flames, spellbound by the glorious\r\nillumination thus set in silent majesty at this gateway to some city of\r\nthe under World.\r\n\r\nBulger’s warning growl brought me to myself, but I must end this chapter\r\nhere, dear friends, and halt to collect my thoughts before I proceed to\r\ntell you what I saw after passing this glorious gateway illumined by\r\nthese two gigantic candelabra of solid silver.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XV\r\n\r\n  THE GUARDS AT THE SILVER GATEWAY.—WHAT THEY WERE LIKE.—OUR RECEPTION\r\n    BY THEM.—I MAKE A WONDERFUL DISCOVERY.—THE WORLD’S FIRST\r\n    TELEPHONE.—BULGER AND I SUCCEED IN MAKING FRIENDS WITH THESE\r\n    STRANGERS.—A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE SOODOPSIES, THAT IS, MAKE\r\n    BELIEVE EYES, OR THE FORMIFOLK, THAT IS, ANT PEOPLE.—HOW A BLIND\r\n    MAN MAY READ YOUR WRITING.\r\n\r\n\r\nO great Don Fum, Master of all Masters, what do I not owe thee for\r\nhaving made known unto me the existence of this wonderful World within a\r\nWorld! Would that I had been a worker in metal! I would not have passed\r\nthe glorious portal at which I had halted without having set in deep\r\nintaglio upon its silver columns the full name of the most glorious\r\nscholar whom the world has ever known. Bulger had warned me that this\r\ngateway was guarded, and therefore I entered it cautiously, taking care\r\nto peer into the dark corners lest I might be a target for some\r\ninvisible enemy to hurl a weapon at.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had I passed the gateway than three curious little beings of\r\nabout my own height threw themselves swiftly and silently across the\r\npathway. They wore short jackets, knee-breeches, and leggings reaching\r\nto their ankles, but no hats or shoes, and their clothes were profusely\r\ndecorated with beautiful silver buttons.\r\n\r\nTheir hands and feet and heads seemed much too large for their little\r\nbodies and pipe-stemmy legs, and gave them an uncanny and brownie look,\r\nwhich was greatly increased by the staring and glassy expression of\r\ntheir large, round eyes. When I first caught sight of them they had hold\r\nof hands, but now they stood each with his pair stretched out toward\r\nBulger and me, waving them strangely in the air and agitating their long\r\nfingers as if they were endeavoring to set a spell upon us.\r\n\r\nI imagined that I could feel a sensation of drowsiness creeping over me\r\nand made haste to call out:—\r\n\r\n“Nay, good people, do not strive to set a spell upon me. I am the\r\nillustrious explorer from the upper world,—Sebastian von Troomp,—and\r\ncome to you with most peaceful intent.”\r\n\r\nBut they paid no heed to my words, merely advancing a few inches and\r\nwith outstretched hands continued to beat and claw the air, pausing only\r\nto signal to each other by touching each other’s hands or different\r\nparts of each other’s bodies. I was deeply perplexed by their actions,\r\nand took a step or two forward when instantly they fell back the same\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\n“All men are brothers,” I exclaimed in a loud tone, “and carry the same\r\nshaped hearts in their breasts. Why do you fear me? You are thrice my\r\nnumber and in your own home. I pray you stand fast and speak to me!”\r\n\r\nAs I was pronouncing these words, they kept jerking their heads back as\r\nif the sound of my voice were smiting them in the face. It was very\r\nstrange. Suddenly one of them drew from his pocket a ball of silken\r\ncord, and, deftly unrolling it, tossed one end toward me. It flew\r\ndirectly towards me, for its end was weighed with a thin disk of\r\npolished silver, as was the end retained in the hand of the thrower. His\r\nnext move was to open his jacket and apparently press his disk against\r\nhis bare body right over his heart. I made haste to do the same with\r\nmine, holding it firmly in place. This done, he retreated a step or two\r\nuntil the silken cord had been drawn quite taut. Then he paused and\r\nstood for several instants without moving a muscle, after which he\r\npassed the disk to one of his companions, who, having pressed it against\r\nhis heart in turn, passed it to the third of the group.\r\n\r\nWith the quickness of thought the truth now burst upon me: The three\r\nbrownie-like creatures in front of me were not only blind, but they were\r\ndeaf and dumb. The one sense upon which they relied, and which in them\r\nwas of most marvellous keenness, was the sense of feeling. The strange\r\nmotions of their hands and fingers, so much like the beating and waving\r\nof an insect’s feelers, were simply to intercept and measure the\r\nvibrations of the air set in motion by the movements of my body. Their\r\nlarge round eyes, too, had but the sense of feeling, but so wondrously\r\nacute was it that it was almost like the power of sight, enabling them\r\nby the vibration of the air upon the balls to tell exactly how near a\r\nmoving object is to them. Their purpose in throwing the silken cord and\r\nsilver disk to me was by measuring the beating of my heart and comparing\r\nit with their own to determine whether I was human like them.\r\n\r\nJudge of my astonishment, dear friends, upon seeing one of their number\r\npoint to the silver disk and, by means of sign-language, give me to\r\nunderstand that they wanted to feel the heart of the living creature in\r\nmy company.\r\n\r\nStooping down, I hastened to gratify their curiosity by applying it over\r\nmy dear Bulger’s heart.\r\n\r\nAt once there was an expression of most comical amazement depicted on\r\ntheir faces as they passed the disk from one to the other and pressed it\r\nagainst different parts of their bodies—now against their breasts, now\r\nagainst their cheeks, and even against their closed eyelids. Of course I\r\nknew that their amazement proceeded from the rapid beating of Bulger’s\r\nheart, and I enjoyed their child-like surprise very much. All expression\r\nof fear now vanished from their faces, and I was delighted with the look\r\nof sweet temper and good humor that played about their features, now\r\nwreathed in smiles.\r\n\r\nSlowly and on tip-toe they drew near to Bulger and me and for several\r\nminutes amused themselves mightily by running their long, flexible\r\nfingers hither and thither over our bodies.\r\n\r\nIt did not take them long to discover that I was to all intents and\r\npurpose a creature of their own kind, but not so with Bulger. Their\r\nround faces became seamed and lined with wonder as they made themselves\r\nacquainted with his, to them, strange build, and ever and anon as they\r\nfelt him over would they pause and in lightning-like motions of their\r\nfingers on each other’s hands and arms and faces exchange thoughts as to\r\nthe wonderful being which had entered the portal of their city.\r\n\r\nNo doubt you are dying of impatience, dear friends, to be told something\r\nmore definite concerning these strange people among whom I had fallen.\r\nWell, know, then, that their existence had been darkly hinted at in the\r\nmanuscript of the Great Master, Don Fum. I say darkly hinted at, for you\r\nmust bear in mind that Don Fum never visited this World within a World;\r\nthat his wonderful wisdom enabled him to reason it all out without\r\nseeing it, just as the great naturalists of our day, upon finding a\r\nsingle tooth belonging to some gigantic creature which lived thousands\r\nof years ago, are able to draw complete pictures of him.\r\n\r\nWell, these curious beings whose city Bulger and I had entered are\r\ncalled by two different names in Don Fum’s wonderful book. In some\r\nplaces he speaks of them as the Soodopsies, or Make-believe Eyes, and in\r\nothers as the Formifolk or Ant People. Either name was most appropriate,\r\ntheir large, round, clear eyes being really make-believe ones, for, as I\r\nhave told you, they had absolutely no sense of sight; while on the other\r\nhand, the fact that they were deaf, dumb, and blind, and lived in\r\nunderground homes, made them well entitled to the name of Ant People. In\r\na few moments the three Soodopsies had succeeded in teaching me the main\r\nprinciples of their pressure-language, so that I was, to their great\r\ndelight, enabled to answer a number of their questions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FORMIFOLK TRY THE BEAT OF THE BARON’S HEART BY\r\nTELEPHONE.]\r\n\r\nBut think not, dear friends, that these very wise and active little\r\nfolk, skilled in so many arts, have no other language than one\r\nconsisting of pressures of different degree, made by their finger-tips\r\nupon each other’s bodies. They had a most beautiful language, so rich\r\nthat they were able to express the most difficult thoughts, to give\r\nutterance to the most varied emotions; in short, a language quite the\r\nequal of ours in all respects save one—it contained absolutely no word\r\nthat could give them the faintest notion what color was. This is not to\r\nbe wondered at, for they themselves neither had nor could have even the\r\nfaintest conception of what I meant by color, so that when I attempted\r\nto make them understand that our stars were bright points in the sky,\r\nthey asked me if they would prick my finger if I should press upon one\r\nof them. But you doubtless are anxious to know how the Formifolk can\r\npossibly make use of any other language than that of pressures. Well, I\r\nwill tell you. Every Soodopsy carried at his girdle a little blank-book,\r\nif I may so term it, the covers being of thin silver plates variously\r\ncarved and chased as the owner’s taste may prompt. The leaves of this\r\nbook also consist of thin sheets of silver not much thicker than our\r\ntin-foil; also fastened to his girdle by a silken cord hangs a silver\r\npen or, rather, a stylus. Now, when a Soodopsy wishes to say something\r\nto one of his people, something too difficult to express by pressures of\r\nthe finger-tips, he simply turns over a leaf of the silver against the\r\ninside of either cover, both of which are slightly padded, and taking up\r\nhis stylus proceeds to write out what he wishes to say; and this done he\r\ndeftly tears the leaf out and hands it to his companion, who taking it\r\nand turning it over, runs the wonderfully sensitive tips of his fingers\r\nover the raised writing and reads it with the greatest ease; only of\r\ncourse he reads from right to left instead of from left to light, as it\r\nwas written. So, hereafter, when I repeat my conversations with the\r\nFormifolk, you will understand how they were conducted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\n  IDEAS OF THE FORMIFOLK CONCERNING OUR UPPER WORLD.—THE DANCING\r\n    SPECTRE.—THEIR EFFORTS TO LAY HOLD OF HIM.—MY SOLEMN PROMISE THAT\r\n    HE SHOULD BEHAVE HIMSELF.—WE SET OUT FOR THE CITY OF THE\r\n    MAKE-BELIEVE EYES.—MY AMAZEMENT AT THE MAGNIFICENCE OF THE\r\n    APPROACHES TO IT.—WE REACH THE GREAT BRIDGE OF SILVER, AND I GET\r\n    MY FIRST GLANCE OF THE CITY OF CANDELABRA.—BRIEF ACCOUNT OF THE\r\n    WONDERS SPREAD OUT BEFORE MY EYES.—EXCITEMENT OCCASIONED BY OUR\r\n    ARRIVAL.—OUR SILVER BED-CHAMBER.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough thousands and thousands of years had gone by since the\r\nFormifolk had, by constant exposure to the flicker and glare of the\r\nburning gas which their ancestors had discovered and made use of to\r\nillumine their underground world, gradually lost their sense of sight,\r\nand then in consequence of the deep and awful silence that forever\r\nreigned about them had also lost their sense of hearing and naturally\r\nthereafter their power of speech, yet, marvellous to relate, they still\r\nkept within their minds dim and shadowy traditions of the upper world,\r\nand the “mighty lamp,” as they called the sun, which burned for twelve\r\nhours and then went out, leaving the world in darkness until the spirits\r\nof the air could trim it again. And, strange to say, many of the unreal\r\nthings of the upper world had been by the workings of their minds\r\ntransformed into realities, while the realities had become the merest\r\ncobwebs of the brain. For instance, the shadows cast by our bodies in\r\nthe sunlight and forever following at our heels they had come to think\r\nwere actual creatures, our doubles, so to speak, and that on account of\r\nthese “dancing spectres,” as they called them, which dogged our\r\nfootsteps for our life long, sitting like mar-joys at our feasts, it was\r\nutterly impossible for the people of the upper world to be entirely\r\nhappy as they were, and it occurred to them at once that I must have\r\nsuch a double following at my heels, so several times they suddenly\r\njoined hands, and, forming a circle about me, gradually closed up with\r\nintent to lay hold of the dancing spectre. This they did, too, after I\r\nhad assured them that what they had in mind was the mere shadow cast by\r\na person walking in the light. But as they had absolutely no idea of the\r\nnature of light, I only had my trouble for my pains.\r\n\r\nNor did they give over making every now and then the most frantic and\r\nlaughable efforts to catch the little dancing gentleman who, as they\r\nwere bound to think, was quietly trudging along at my heels, but who, so\r\nthey informed me, was far quicker in his motions than any escaping water\r\nor falling object. Finally, they held one of their silent but very\r\nexcited powwows, during which the thousand lightning-like pressures and\r\ntappings which they made upon each other’s bodies gave the spectator the\r\nidea that they were three deaf and dumb schoolboys engaged in a\r\nscrimmage over a bag of marbles, and then they informed me that they had\r\nresolved to permit Bulger and me to enter their city provided I would\r\ngive them the word of a nobleman that I would restrain my nimble-footed\r\ndouble from doing them any harm.\r\n\r\nI made them a most solemn promise that he should behave himself.\r\nWhereupon they greeted both Bulger and me as brothers, stroking our\r\nhair, patting our heads, and kissing me on the cheeks, and, what was\r\nmore, they told us their names, which were Long Thumbs, Square Nose, and\r\nShaggy Brows.\r\n\r\nAll this time I had been every now and then casting anxious glances on\r\nahead of me, for I was dying of impatience to enter the marvellous city\r\nof the Ant People.\r\n\r\nI say marvellous, dear friends, for though many had been the wonderful\r\nthings I had seen in my lifetime in the far-away corners of the upper\r\nworld, yet here was a sight which, as it gradually unfolded itself\r\nbefore my eyes, shackled my very heart and caused me to gasp for breath.\r\nIt was with no little surprise at the very outset that I discovered that\r\nthe walls and floor of the beautiful passage through which the\r\nSoodopsies were leading Bulger and me were of pure silver, the former\r\nbeing composed of polished panels ornamented with finely executed\r\nchasings and carvings, and the latter, as had in fact all the floors and\r\nstreets and passages of the city having upon their polished surfaces\r\nslightly raised characters which I will explain later. But as one\r\npassage opened into another, and then four or more all centred in a vast\r\ncircular chamber which we traversed with our three silent guides only to\r\nenter chambers and corridors of greater size and beauty, all brilliantly\r\nlighted by rows of the same glorious candelabra upholding clusters of\r\ntongues of flame—I could compare the scene to nothing save a series of\r\nmagnificent ball-rooms and banquet-halls, out of which the happy guests\r\nhad been suddenly driven by the deep and awful rumble of an earthquake\r\nshock, the lights having been left burning.\r\n\r\nNow the scene began to change. Long Thumbs, who was leading the way, and\r\nin whose large palm my little hand lay completely lost, suddenly turned\r\nto the right and led me up an arched way. I saw that we were crossing a\r\nbridge over a stream as black and sluggish as Lethe itself.\r\n\r\nBut such a bridge! Never had my eye rested upon so light and airy a\r\nspan, springing from bank to bank; not the plain and solid work of the\r\nstone-mason, but the fair and cunning result of the metal worker’s\r\nskill, like the labor of love, delicate, yet strong, and almost too\r\nbeautiful for use.\r\n\r\nTwo rows of silver lamps of exquisite workmanship crowned its gracefully\r\narching sides, and when we stood upon its highest bend, Long Thumbs\r\nhalted and wrote upon his tablet: “Now, little baron, we are about to\r\nenter the dwelling-place of our people. Thy head is large, and there is,\r\nno doubt, much of wisdom stored away in thy brain. Make such use of it\r\nas not to disturb the perfect happiness of our nation, for no doubt many\r\nof our people will be suspicious of thee, and for the first time in\r\nthousands of years a Soodopsy will lay him down to sleep, and in his\r\ndreams feel the touch of the dancing spectre of the upper world.” I\r\npromised Long Thumbs that he should have no reason to be dissatisfied\r\nwith me, and then making an excuse that I was a-weary, I feasted my eyes\r\nfor several moments upon the glorious scene spread out before me.\r\n\r\nIt was the city of the Formifolk in all its splendor—a splendor, alas,\r\nunseen by, unknown to, the very people dwelling in it, for to them its\r\nsilver walls and arches, its endless rows of glorious candelabra\r\nuplifting their countless clusters of never-dying jets of flame, its\r\nexquisitely carved and chiselled portals and gateways, its graceful\r\nchairs and settees and beds and couches and tables and lamps and basins\r\nand ewers and thousands of articles of furniture all in purest silver,\r\nhammered or wrought by the cunning hands of their ancestors while they\r\nstill were possessed of the power of sight, could only be known to\r\nthese, their descendants, by the sole sense of feeling.\r\n\r\nFrom the lofty ceilings of corridors and archways, from the jutting\r\nornaments of the house-fronts, from cornice and coping, from the four\r\nsides of columns, and from the corners of cupolas and minarets, here and\r\nthere and everywhere hung silver lamps of more than Oriental beauty of\r\nform and finish, all with their never-dying tongues of flame sending\r\nforth a soft though unsteady light to fall upon sightless eyes!\r\n\r\nBut yet these countless flames, by the aid of which I was enabled to\r\ngaze upon the splendor of this city of silver palaces, were life if not\r\nlight to the Soodopsies, for they warmed these vast subterranean depths\r\nand filled them with a deliciously soft and strangely balmy air.\r\n\r\nAnd yet to think that Bulger and I were the only two living creatures to\r\nbe able to look upon this scene of almost celestial beauty and radiance!\r\n\r\nIt made me sad, and plunged me into such a fit of deep abstraction that\r\nit required a second gentle tug of Long Thumbs’ hand to bring me to\r\nmyself.\r\n\r\nAs we crossed the bridge and entered the city proper, I was delighted to\r\nnote that the streets and open squares were ornamented with hundred of\r\nstatues all in solid silver, and that they represented specimens of a\r\nrace of great beauty of person; and then it occurred to me how fortunate\r\nit was that the Soodopsies could not gaze upon these images of their\r\nancestors and thus become living witnesses of their own woful\r\nfalling-away from the former physical grace of their race.\r\n\r\nNow, like human ants that they were, the Formifolk began to swarm forth\r\nfrom their dwellings on every side of the city, and my keen ear caught\r\nthe low shuffling sound of their bare feet over the silver streets as\r\nthey closed in about us, their arms flashing in the light and their\r\nfaces lined with strange emotions as they learned of the arrival among\r\nthem of two creatures from the upper world. They were all clad, men and\r\nwomen alike, in silk garments of a chestnut brown, and I at once\r\nconcluded that they drew this material from the same sources as the\r\nMikkamenkies, for, dear friends, you must not get an idea that the\r\nFormifolk were not well deserving of the name which Don Fum had bestowed\r\nupon them. They were genuine human ants and, except when sleeping,\r\nalways at work.\r\n\r\nIt was true that since their blindness had come upon them they had not\r\nbeen able to add a single column or archway to the Silver City, but in\r\nall the ordinary concerns of life they were quite as industrious as\r\never, chasing, carving, chiselling, planting, weaving, knitting, and\r\ndoing a thousand and one things that you and I with our two good eyes\r\nwould find it hard to accomplish.\r\n\r\nI had made known to Long Thumbs the fact that Bulger and I were both\r\nvery tired and weary from our long tramp, and that we craved to have\r\nsome refreshment set before us, and then to be permitted to go to rest\r\nat once, promising that after we had had several hours’ good sleep we\r\nwould take the greatest pleasure in being presented to the worthy\r\ninhabitants of the Silver City.\r\n\r\nIt was astonishing with what rapidity this request of mine spread from\r\nman to man. Long Thumbs made it known to two at the same time, and these\r\ntwo to four, and these four to eight, and these eight to sixteen, and so\r\non. You see it wouldn’t take long at that rate to tell a million.\r\n\r\nLike magic the Formifolk disappeared from the streets, and in a sort of\r\norderly confusion faded from my sight. Bulger and I were right glad to\r\nbe conducted to a silver bed-chamber, where the traveller’s every want\r\nseemed to be anticipated. The only thing that bothered us was, we had\r\nnot been accustomed to keep the light burning upon going to bed, and\r\nthis made us both a little wakeful at first; but we were too tired to\r\nlet it keep us from dropping off after a few moments, for the mattress\r\nwas soft and springy enough to satisfy any one, and I’m sure that no one\r\ncould have complained that the house wasn’t quiet enough.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\n  IN WHICH YOU READ, DEAR FRIENDS, SOMETHING ABOUT A LIVE ALARM CLOCK\r\n    AND A SOODOPSY BATHER AND RUBBER.—OUR FIRST BREAKFAST IN THE CITY\r\n    OF SILVER.—A NEW WAY TO CATCH FISH WITHOUT HURTING THEIR\r\n    FEELINGS.—HOW THE STREETS AND HOUSES WERE NUMBERED, AND WHERE THE\r\n    SIGNBOARDS WERE.—A VERY ORIGINAL LIBRARY IN WHICH BOOKS NEVER GET\r\n    DOG-EARED.—HOW VELVET SOLES ENJOYED HER FAVORITE POETS.—I AM\r\n    PRESENTED TO THE LEARNED BARREL BROW, WHO PROCEEDS TO GIVE ME HIS\r\n    VIEWS OF THE UPPER WORLD.—THEY ENTERTAINED ME AMAZINGLY AND MAY\r\n    INTEREST YOU.\r\n\r\n\r\nI can’t tell you, dear friends, exactly how long Bulger and I slept, but\r\nit must have been a good while, for when I was awakened I felt\r\nthoroughly refreshed. I say awakened, for I was awakened by a gentle\r\ntapping on the back of my hand—six taps.\r\n\r\nAt first I thought I was dreaming, but, upon rubbing my eyes, I saw\r\nstanding by the side of my bed one of the Soodopsies who, feeling me\r\nstir, took up his tablet and wrote as follows:—\r\n\r\n“My name is Tap Hard. I am a clock. There is a score of us. We keep the\r\ntime for our people by counting the swing of the pendulum in the Time\r\nHouse. It swings about as fast as we breathe. There are one hundred\r\nbreaths to a minute and one hundred minutes to an hour. Our day is\r\ndivided into six hours’ worktime and six hours’ sleeptime. It is now the\r\nrising hour. If thou wilt be pleased to rise, one of our people from the\r\nHealth House will rub all the tired out of thy limbs.”\r\n\r\nI touched Tap Hard’s heart to thank him, and made haste to scramble out\r\nof bed. Now, for the first time, I looked about the silver chamber in\r\nwhich I had slept. On silver shelves lay silver combs and silver shears\r\nand silver knives; on a silver stand stood a silver ewer within a silver\r\nbasin; on silver pegs hung silken towels, while spread upon the silver\r\nfloor lay soft, silken rugs, and above and around on ceiling and walls\r\nthe tongues of flame were a thousand times repeated in the panels of\r\nburnished silver.\r\n\r\nI had made trial of all sorts of Oriental rubber and bath attendants in\r\nmy day, but the silent little Soodopsy who laved and rubbed and tapped\r\nand stroked me exceeded them all in dexterity, added to which was a new\r\ncharm, for I was not obliged to listen to long and senseless tales of\r\nadventure and intrigue, but was left quite alone to my own thoughts.\r\nBulger was also treated to a sponging and a rubbing—a luxury which he\r\nhad not enjoyed since we had left Castle Trump.\r\n\r\nMy toilet was no sooner completed than Long Thumbs made his appearance\r\nto inquire after my health and to superintend the serving of my\r\nbreakfast, which consisted of a piece of most delicate boiled fish\r\nflanked with oysters of delicious flavor, and trimmed with slices of\r\nthose monstrous mushrooms which I had eaten among the Mikkamenkies, the\r\nwhole served in a beautiful silver dish on a silver tray with silver\r\neating utensils.\r\n\r\nRemembering the strange way in which the fish were caught and killed in\r\nthe Land of the Mikkamenkies, I was curious to know how the Soodopsies\r\nmanaged it, for I knew enough of them to know that the sensation of\r\nanything struggling for its life in their hands would suffice to throw\r\nthem into fits of great suffering, to fill their gentle hearts with\r\nnameless terror.\r\n\r\n“At the end of one of the many corridors leading out of our city,”\r\nexplained Long Thumbs, “there is a rocky chamber which was called by our\r\nancestors Uphaslok, or the Death Hole, because any being which breathes\r\nits air for a few moments is sure to die. So they closed it up forever,\r\nleaving only a small pipe projecting through the door; but, strange to\r\nsay, those who breathe this air suffer no pain whatever, but presently\r\ndrop off into a pleasant dream, and, unless they be rescued, would, of\r\ncourse, never wake again. Now, as our laws forbid us to cause any pain\r\nto the most insignificant creature, it occurred to our ancestors that by\r\nmeans of a long pipe they could turn this poisoned air into the river\r\nwhenever they wanted a supply of fish for food. This they did, and,\r\nstrange to say, the moment the fish felt the gas bubbling into the\r\nriver, they at once swam up to the mouth of the pipe, and struggled with\r\neach other for a chance to catch the deadly bubbles as they left its\r\nmouth, so pleasant a sensation do they cause as they gradually plunge,\r\nthe creature breathing them into his last sleep. And in this way it is\r\nwe are enabled to feed upon the fish in our river, without breaking the\r\nlaw of the land.”\r\n\r\nI began to understand that I had fallen in with a very original and\r\ninteresting folk, but Bulger was not altogether pleased with them, for\r\nseveral reasons, as I soon observed. In the first place he couldn’t\r\naccustom himself to the cold and glassy look of their eyes, and in the\r\nnext he was a bit jealous of their wonderfully keen scent—a sense which\r\nwith them was so strong that they invariably gave signs of being\r\nconscious of Bulger’s approach even before I could see him, and always\r\nturned their faces in the direction in which he was coming.\r\n\r\nYou will remember, dear friends, that I mentioned the fact that the\r\nFormifolk went barefoot, and that their feet as well as their hands\r\nseemed altogether too large for their bodies, and I wish to add, that\r\nwhile Bulger and I were being led through the long corridors and winding\r\npassages on our way into the City of Silver, the three Soodopsies\r\nfrequently half halted and seemed to be feeling on the floor for\r\nsomething with the balls of their feet. I thought no more about it,\r\nuntil Bulger and I started out for our first stroll through their\r\nwonderful town, when, to my great delight, I made the discovery that the\r\nnumbers of the houses, the names of the occupants, the names of the\r\nstreets, as well as all signboards, so to speak, and all guide-posts\r\nwere in slightly raised letters on the floors and pavements, and then\r\nthe truth dawned upon me, that Long Thumbs and his companions were\r\nsimply halting now and then to read the names of the streets with the\r\nballs of their feet, in order to know if they were taking the right\r\nroad.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BARREL BROW ENGAGED IN READING FOUR BOOKS AT ONCE.]\r\n\r\nAy, more than this, dear friends, the first time Bulger and I passed\r\nthrough one of the open squares of the City of Silver, you may imagine\r\nmy satisfaction upon the discovery that the silver pavements were\r\nliterally covered with the writings of the Soodopsy authors in raised\r\ncharacters.\r\n\r\nNow, in Don Fum’s wonderful book he had, in his masterly manner, given\r\nme the key to the language of the Formifolk, so that with very slight\r\neffort I was able to make the additional discovery that some of the\r\nstreets were given up to the writers of history, and some to story\r\nwriters, while others were filled with the learned works of\r\nphilosophers, and others still contained many thousands of lines from\r\nthe best poets which the nation had produced.\r\n\r\nAnd I had very little difficulty in discovering which were the favorite\r\npoems of the Soodopsies, for, as you may readily suppose, these were\r\npolished like a silver mirror by the shuffling of the many thankful feet\r\nover their sweet and soulful lines.\r\n\r\nI noticed that the writings of the philosophers in this, as in my own\r\nworld, found few readers, for the raised letters were, in many cases,\r\ntarnished and black from lack of soles trampling over them in search of\r\nwisdom.\r\n\r\nSomewhat later, when I had become acquainted with Velvet Soles, the\r\ndaughter of Long Thumbs, a gracious little being as full of inward light\r\nas she was blind to the outer world, and she invited me to “come for a\r\nread,” I had a hard task of it in persuading her that I could not remove\r\nwhat she called my ridiculous “foot boxes” and join her in enjoying some\r\nof her favorite poems. It was to me a delicious pastime to accompany\r\nthis happy little maiden when she “went for a read,” to walk beside her\r\nand watch the ever-varying expression of her beautiful face as the soles\r\nof her tiny feet pressed the words of love and hope and joy, and her\r\nheart expanded, and she clasped her hands in attitudes of blissful\r\nenjoyment, seemingly just as deep and fervent as if the blessed sunlight\r\nrested on her brow, and her eyes were drinking in the glory of a summer\r\nsunset. O dwellers in the upper world with the light streaming into the\r\nwindows of your souls, with your ears open to the music of pipe and\r\nflute and violin, and to the sweeter music of the voice of love, how\r\nmuch more have ye than she, and yet how rarely are ye as happy, how\r\nrarely do ye know that sweet contentment which, as in this case, came\r\nfrom within?\r\n\r\n“Go to the ant; consider her ways, and be wise, which, having no guide,\r\noverseer, or ruler, provideth her meat in the summer and gathereth her\r\nfood in the harvest.”\r\n\r\nIn a short time the Formifolk seemed to become quite accustomed to\r\nhaving Bulger and me among them, and they apparently “touched hands”\r\nwith me in quite as friendly a fashion as if I had been one of them.\r\n\r\nOne day Long Thumbs conducted me to the house of the most aged and\r\nlearned of the Soodopsies, Barrel Brow by name.\r\n\r\nHe received me very cordially, although I interrupted him at his\r\nstudies, for, as I entered his apartment, he was in the act of reading\r\nfour different books at the same time: two were lying on the floor, and\r\nhe was perusing their raised characters with the soles of his feet, and\r\ntwo others were set up on a frame in front of him and he was deciphering\r\nthem with the tips of his fingers.\r\n\r\nBut when informed who I was he stopped work at once and taking up his\r\ntablets, asked me a number of questions concerning the upper world, of\r\nwhich he had, however, no very exalted opinion.\r\n\r\n“You people,” said he, “if I understand correctly the ancient writings\r\nof those of our nation who still preserved certain traditions of the\r\nupper world, are endowed with several senses which are utterly lacking\r\nin us, I am happy to say, for if I understand correctly ye have in the\r\nfirst place a sense which ye call hearing, a most troublesome sense, for\r\nby means of it ye are being constantly disturbed and annoyed by\r\nvibrations of the air coming from afar. Now, they can be of no possible\r\ngood to you. Ye might as well have a sense that would inform you what\r\nwas going on in the moon. Therefore, my conclusion is, that the sense of\r\nhearing only serves to distract and weaken the brain.\r\n\r\n“Another sense that ye are possessed of,” continued Barrel Brow, “ye\r\ncall the sense of sight—a power even more useless and distracting than\r\nhearing, for the reason that it enables you to know things which it is\r\nutterly bootless to know, such as what your next door neighbors may be\r\ndoing, how the mountains are acting on the other side of your rivers,\r\nhow your sky, as ye call it, might feel if you could touch it with your\r\nfingers, which ye can’t do, however; how soon rain will fall, which is a\r\nuseless piece of knowledge if ye have roofs to cover you, as I suppose\r\nye have; but the most ridiculous use which ye make of this sense of\r\nsight is the manufacture of what ye call pictures, by means of which ye\r\nseem to take the greatest pleasure in deceiving this very sense of which\r\nye are so very proud. If I understand correctly these pictures, if felt\r\nof, are quite as smooth as that panel there, but so cunningly do ye draw\r\nthe lines and lay in the colors, whatever they may be, that ye really\r\nsucceed in deceiving yourselves and stand for hours in front of one of\r\nthese bits of trickery when ye might, if ye chose, feast your eyes, as\r\nye call it, upon the very thing which the trickster has imitated. Now,\r\nas life is much shorter in the upper world than in ours, it seems very\r\nstrange to me that ye should wish to waste it in this foolish manner.\r\nThen, there is another thing, little baron,” continued the learned\r\nBarrel Brow, “which I wish to mention. It is this: The people of the\r\nupper world pride themselves very much upon what they term the power of\r\nspeech, which, if I understand correctly, is a faculty they have of\r\nexpressing their thoughts to each other by violently expelling the air\r\nfrom their lungs, and that this air, rushing into the ventilators of the\r\nbrain, which ye call ears, produces a sensation of sound as ye term it,\r\nand in this way one of thy people standing at one end of the town might\r\nmake his wishes known to another standing at the other end. Now, thou\r\nwilt pardon my thinking so, little baron, but this seems to me to be not\r\na whit above the brute creature, which, opening its vast jaws, thus sets\r\nthe air in motion in calling its young or breathing defiance at an\r\nenemy. And if I understand correctly, little baron, so proud are thy\r\npeople of this power of speech that they insist upon making use of it at\r\nall times and upon all occasions, and, strange to say, these ‘talkers’\r\ncan always find plenty of people to open their ears to these vibrations\r\nof the air, although the effect is so wearying to the brain that in the\r\nend they invariably fall asleep. But if I understand correctly, the\r\nwomen are even fonder of displaying their skill in thus puffing out the\r\nair from their lungs than the men are; but, that not satisfied with this\r\nsuperior power of puffing out the words, they actually have recourse to\r\na potent herb which they steep in boiling water and drink as hot as\r\npossible on account of its effect in loosening the tongue and allowing\r\nthe talker to do more puffing than she could otherwise.\r\n\r\n“But all this, little baron,” continued the learned Barrel Brow, “might\r\nbe overlooked and regarded in the light of mere amusement were it not\r\nfor the fact, if I understand correctly, that brain ventilators being of\r\ndifferent sizes in different persons, the consequence is that these\r\npuffs of air which ye use to make known your thoughts to each other\r\nproduce different effects upon different persons, and the result is,\r\nthat the people of the upper world spend half their time repeating the\r\npuffs which they have already sent out, and that even then thou canst\r\nrarely find two people who will agree exactly as to the number, kind,\r\nstrength, and meaning of the puffs blown into each other’s brain\r\nventilators, and that therefore has it become necessary to provide what\r\nye call judges to settle these disputes which often last for lifetimes,\r\nthe two parties spending their entire fortunes hiring witnesses to come\r\nbefore these judges and imitate the sound which the air made when it was\r\nset in motion years ago by the angry puffs of the two parties. I\r\nsincerely trust, little baron,” wrote the learned Barrel Brow on his\r\ntablet of silver, “that when thou returnest to thy people thou wilt make\r\nknown to them what I have written for thee to-day, for it is never too\r\nlate to correct a fault, and the longer that fault has lasted the\r\ngreater the credit for correcting it.”\r\n\r\nI promised the learned Soodopsy to do as he requested, and then we\r\ntouched each other on the back of the head, which is the way they say\r\ngood-by in the land of the Formifolk, a touch on the forehead meaning,\r\n“How d’ye do?”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\n  EARLY HISTORY OF THE SOODOPSIES AS RELATED BY BARREL BROW.—HOW THEY\r\n    WERE DRIVEN TO TAKE REFUGE IN THE UNDER WORLD, AND HOW THEY CAME\r\n    UPON THE MARBLE HIGHWAY.—THEIR DISCOVERY OF NATURAL GAS WHICH\r\n    YIELDS THEM LIGHT AND WARMTH, AND OF NATURE’S MAGNIFICENT TREASURE\r\n    HOUSE.—HOW THEY REPLACED THEIR TATTERED GARMENTS AND BEGAN TO\r\n    BUILD THE CITY OF SILVER.—THE STRANGE MISFORTUNES THAT CAME UPON\r\n    THEM, AND HOW THEY ROSE SUPERIOR TO THEM, TERRIBLE AS THEY WERE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd, no doubt, dear friends, you would be glad to hear something about\r\nthe early history of the Soodopsies: who they were, where they came\r\nfrom, and how they happened to find their way down into the World within\r\na World.\r\n\r\nAt least, this was the way I felt after I had been presented to the\r\nlearned Barrel Brow, and so the next time I called upon him I waited\r\npatiently for him to finish reading the four books in front of him, and\r\nthen I said,—\r\n\r\n“Be pleased, dear Master, to tell me something concerning the early\r\nhistory of thy people, and to explain to me how they came to make their\r\nway down into this underground world.”\r\n\r\n“Ages and ages ago,” wrote the learned Barrel Brow, “my people lived\r\nupon the shores of a beautiful land with a vast ocean to the north of\r\nit, and in those days they had the same senses as the other people of\r\nthe upper world. It was a very fair land, indeed, so fair that, in the\r\nwords of the ancient chronicles, the sun looked in vain for a fairer.\r\nIts rivers were deep and broad, its plains were rich and fertile, and\r\nits mountains stored full of silver and gold and copper and tin, and so\r\neasily mined were these metals that our people became famous as metal\r\nworkers; so deft in their workmanship that the other nations from far\r\nand near came to us for swords and shields and spear heads and suits of\r\narmor and table service and armlets and bracelets and, above all, for\r\nlamps most gloriously chased and carved to hang in their palaces and\r\ntemples. And so we were very happy, until one terrible day the great\r\nround world gave a twist and we were turned away from the sun, so that\r\nits rays went slantingly over our heads and gave us no warmth.\r\n\r\n“Ah me, I could weep now,” exclaimed the learned Barrel Brow, “after all\r\nthese centuries, when I think of the cruel fate that overtook my people.\r\nIn a few months the whole face of our fair land was covered with ice and\r\nsnow, and our cattle died, and many of our people, too, before they\r\ncould weave thick cloth to keep their delicate bodies from the pinching\r\ncold. But this was not all; the great blue ocean which had until then\r\ndashed its warm waves and white foam up against our shores now breathed\r\nits icy breath full upon us, driving into our cellars to escape its\r\nfury; and in a few brief months, to our horror, there came drifting down\r\nupon us fields and mountains of ice, which the tempestuous waters cast\r\nup against our shores with deafening crash. To remain there meant death,\r\nswift and terrible, so the command was given to abandon homes and\r\nfiresides and escape to the southward, and this most of them did. But it\r\nso happened that several hundred families belonging to the metal-working\r\nguilds, who knew the underground passages to the mines as foresters know\r\nthe pathless wood, had taken refuge in the vast underground caverns with\r\nall the goods they could carry. Poor deluded creatures! they thought\r\nthat this sudden coming of the winter blast, of the blinding snow and\r\nvast floating fields of ice, was but a freak of nature, and that in a\r\nfew months the old warmth and the old sunshine would come back again.\r\n\r\n“Alas, months went by and their supply of food was almost exhausted and\r\nthe entrances to the mines were closed by gigantic blocks of ice\r\ncemented into one great mass by the snow which the gray clouds had\r\nsifted down upon them. There was now no escape that way. Their only hope\r\nwas to make their way underground to some portal to the upper world.\r\n\r\n“So, with lighted torches but with hearts plunged in the darkness of\r\ndespair, they kept on their way, when one day, or one night, they knew\r\nnot which, their leaders suddenly came upon a broad street of marble\r\nopened by nature’s own hands. It was skirted by a softly flowing river\r\nthat swarmed with fish in scales and shells and skin, and here our\r\npeople halted to eat and drink and rest, and while one of their number\r\nwas striking his flint on one occasion to make a fire to cook a meal, to\r\nhis surprise and delight a tongue of flame darted up from the rocky\r\nfloor and continued to burn, giving light and warmth to them.\r\n\r\n“As they had brought their tools—their drills and chisels and files and\r\ngravers and blow-pipes—with them in their carts and wagons, they made\r\nhaste to fit a pipe to this opening in the rock and set up a cluster of\r\nlights. With food and water and warmth and light their hearts grew\r\nlighter, especially as they soon discovered that in many of the vast\r\ncaverns gigantic mushrooms grew in the wildest profusion.\r\n\r\n“The wisest of them,” continued the learned Barrel Brow, “at once made\r\nup their minds that there must be reservoirs of this gas farther along\r\non this beautiful Marble Highway, so, day by day, they pushed farther\r\ninto this World within a World, halting every now and then to set up a\r\nlighthouse as they called it.\r\n\r\n“After advancing several leagues the exploring party, upon lighting a\r\ncluster of gas jets, were stricken almost speechless with wonder at\r\nfinding themselves upon the very sill of a towering portal opening into\r\na succession of vast chambers, some with flat ceiling, some arched, some\r\ndomed, upon the floors and walls of which lay and hung inexhaustible\r\nquantities of pure silver. Those magnificent caverns were in reality\r\nnature’s vast storehouses of the glorious white metal, and our people\r\nmade haste to set up clusters of gas jets here and there, so that they\r\nmight view the wondrous treasure-house.\r\n\r\n“Here they determined to remain, for here was food and water in\r\nnever-failing supplies, and here they would have light and warmth, and\r\nhere they could forget their miseries by working at their calling, using\r\nthe precious metal with lavish hand to build them living-chambers, and\r\nto fashion the thousand and one things necessary for every-day life. So\r\ngreat was their delight as metal-workers to come upon this exhaustless\r\nsupply of pure silver that they could hardly sleep until they had set up\r\nclusters of gas jets throughout these vast caverns, for, no doubt,\r\nlittle baron, thou hast already guessed that this is the spot I am\r\ntelling thee of; that right here it was where our people halted to build\r\nthe City of Silver.\r\n\r\n“But one thought troubled them and that was where to find needful\r\nclothing, for the old was fast falling into shreds and tatters, when, to\r\ntheir delight, they came upon a bed of mineral wool and with this they\r\nmanaged to weave some cloth. Although it was rather stiff and harsh, yet\r\nit was better than none.\r\n\r\n“While exploring a new cavern one day, one of my wise ancestors saw a\r\nlarge night moth alight near him, and, gently loosening some of its\r\neggs, he carried them home, more as a curiosity than aught else.\r\n\r\n“Imagine how rejoiced he was, however, to see one of the worms which\r\nhatched out set to work spinning a cocoon of silk half as big as his\r\nfist. There was great feasting and merry-making among our people upon\r\nhearing of this glad news, and it was not very long before many a silver\r\nshuttle was rattling in a silver loom, and the soft bodies of our people\r\nwere warmly and comfortably clad. Now, long periods of time went by,\r\nwhich, cut up into your months, would have made many, many years. Our\r\npeople had everything but sunlight, and this, of course, those who were\r\nborn in the under world knew nothing about and therefore did not miss.\r\n\r\n“But, as was to be expected, great changes gradually took place in our\r\npeople. To their inexpressible grief, they noticed that as they busied\r\nthemselves beautifying their new homes by erecting arches and bridges\r\nand terraces, and lining them with glorious candelabra and statues, all\r\nin cast and wrought or hammered silver, their sight was gradually\r\nfailing them, and that in not a very great length of time they should be\r\ntotally blind.\r\n\r\n“This result, little baron,” continued the learned Barrel Brow, “was\r\nvery natural, for the sense of sight was in reality created for\r\nsunlight; for as thou no doubt knowest, all the fish that swim in our\r\nrivers have no eyes, having no need of them. It happened just as they\r\nhad expected—in a few generations more our people discovered that their\r\neyes could no longer see things as thou dost, but yet they could feel\r\nthem if they were not too far away, just as I can feel thy presence now\r\nand tell where thou sittest, and how tall thou art, and how broad thou\r\nart, and whether thou movest to right or left, forward or backward, but\r\nI cannot tell exactly how thou art made until I reach out and touch\r\nthee; then I know all; yes, far better than thou canst know, for our\r\nsense of feeling is keener than thy so-called sight. One of my people\r\ncan feel a grain or roughness upon a silver mirror which to thy eyes\r\nseems smoother than glass. Well, strange to relate, and yet not strange,\r\nour ancestors with the going-out of their sense of sight also felt their\r\nsense of hearing on the wane. Our ears, as thou callest them, having\r\nnothing more to listen to, for eternal silence, as thou knowest, reigns\r\nin this under world, became as useless to us as the tail of the pollywog\r\nwould be to the full-grown frog; and of course with the loss of our\r\nsense of hearing our children were soon unable to learn to talk, and in\r\na certain lapse of time we came to merit full well our new name of\r\nFormifolk, or Ant People, for we were now blind and deaf and dumb.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A SOODOPSY MAIDEN READING HER FAVORITE POET]\r\n\r\n“It is long, very, very long, little baron,” continued the learned\r\nSoodopsy, “since all recollection of sunlight, of color, of sound, died\r\nout of our minds. To-day my people don’t even know the names of these\r\nthings, and thou wouldst have as much chance of success wert thou to\r\nattempt to tell them what light or sound is as thou wouldst have if thou\r\nshouldst try to explain to a savage that there is nothing under the\r\nworld to hold it up, and yet it doesn’t fall. But if thou shouldst lay\r\nseveral pieces of metal in a row and ask one of my people to tell thee\r\nwhat they were, he would try the weight of each and feel its grain\r\ncarefully, possibly smell them or touch his tongue to them, and then he\r\nwould make answer: ‘That is gold; that is silver; that is copper; that\r\nis lead; that is tin; that is iron.’\r\n\r\n“But thou wouldst say, ‘They all are differently colored; canst not\r\nperceive that?’\r\n\r\n“‘I know not what thou meanest by color,’ he would reply. ‘But mark me:\r\nnow I hide them all beneath this silken kerchief, and still by touching\r\nthem with my finger tips I can tell what metal each one is. If thou\r\ncanst do it, then art thou as good a man as I.’\r\n\r\n“What sayest now, little baron?” asked the learned Barrel Brow, while\r\nhis face was wreathed in a smile of triumph; “dost think thou wouldst be\r\nas good a man as this Soodopsy?”\r\n\r\n“Nay, indeed I do not, wise Master,” wrote I upon my silver tablet; “and\r\nI thank thee for all thou has told me and taught me, and I ask leave, O\r\nBarrel Brow, to come again and converse with thee.”\r\n\r\n“That thou mayest, little baron,” traced the learned Soodopsy upon his\r\nsilver tablet; and then as I turned to leave his chamber he reached\r\nquickly after me and touched me with a bent forefinger, which meant\r\nreturn.\r\n\r\n“Thy pardon, little baron,” he wrote, “but thou art leaving my study\r\nwithout thy faithful Bulger; am I not right?”\r\n\r\nI was astounded, for indeed he was right, and though without the sense\r\nof sight he had seen more than I with two good eyes wide open. There lay\r\nBulger fast asleep on a silken-covered hassock.\r\n\r\nOur silent conversation had so wearied him that he had sailed off into\r\nthe Land of Nod on the wings of a dream.\r\n\r\nHe hung his head and looked very shame-faced when my call aroused him\r\nand he discovered that I had actually reached the doorway without his\r\nknowing it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\n  BEGINS WITH SOMETHING ABOUT THE LITTLE SOODOPSIES, BUT BRANCHES OFF\r\n    ON ANOTHER SUBJECT; TO WIT;—THE SILENT SONG OF SINGING FINGERS,\r\n    THE FAIR MAID OF THE CITY OF SILVER.—BARREL BROW IS KIND ENOUGH TO\r\n    ENLIGHTEN ME ON A CERTAIN POINT, AND HE TAKES OCCASION TO PAY\r\n    BULGER A VERY HIGH COMPLIMENT, WHICH, OF COURSE, HE DESERVED.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe longer I stayed among the Soodopsies the more did I become convinced\r\nthat they were the happiest, the lightest hearted, the most contented\r\nhuman beings that I had met in all my travels. If it were possible for\r\nthe links of a long chain suspended over a chasm to be living, thinking\r\nbeings for a short while, it seems to me they would hang together in the\r\nmost perfect accord, for each link would discover that he was no better\r\nthan his neighbor, and that the welfare of all the other links depended\r\nupon him and his upon theirs. So it was with the Formifolk, having no\r\nsense of sight they knew no such thing as envy, and all hands were alike\r\nwhen reached out for a greeting.\r\n\r\nI was amazed at times to see how they could feel my approach when I\r\nwould be ten or fifteen feet away from them, and I often amused myself\r\nby trying to steal by one of them in the street. But no, it was\r\nimpossible; a hand would invariably be held out for a greeting. Little\r\nby little, they got over their distrust of me, and made up their minds\r\nthat I had told them the truth when I said that no dancing spectre was\r\nforever following at my heels. One of the most interesting sights was to\r\nsee a group of Soodopsy children at play, building houses with silver\r\nblocks, or playing a game very much like our dominoes. I noticed that\r\nthey kept no tally, such wonderful memories had they that it was quite\r\nunnecessary.\r\n\r\nAt first the children were so frightened upon feeling of me that they\r\nfled with terror pictured upon their little faces. Their parents\r\nexplained to me that I made very much the same impression upon them as\r\nif I should feel of a person whose skin was as rough as a sea urchin’s.\r\n\r\nWhen at last I succeeded in coaxing several of them to my side, I was\r\nastounded to see one little fellow who had by chance pressed his tiny\r\nhand against my watch pocket spring away from me terror-stricken. He had\r\nfelt it tick and didn’t stop running until he had reached his mother’s\r\nside.\r\n\r\nHis wonderful tale that the little baron carried some strange animal\r\naround in his pocket soon caused a crowd to collect about me, and it was\r\nsome time before I could persuade even the parents that the watch was\r\nnot alive and that it was not the little animal’s heart which they felt\r\nbeating.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion, when a little Soodopsy was sitting on my lap with its\r\ntiny arm twined affectionately around my neck, I happened to make some\r\nremark to Bulger, when, to my amazement, the child sprang out of my arms\r\nand darted away with a look of terror upon his little face.\r\n\r\nWhat had I done to him?\r\n\r\nWhy, it seems that by the merest chance his tiny hand had been pressed\r\nagainst my throat, and that he had been terrified by feeling the strange\r\nvibration caused by my voice. Immediately the report was spread about\r\nthat the little baron carried another little baron around in his throat,\r\nthat any one could feel him, if I would only consent. It took me a long\r\nwhile to convince them that what they felt was not another little baron,\r\nbut merely the vibration caused by my expelling my breath in a way\r\npeculiar to the people of the upper world. But all the same, I was\r\nobliged to say many hundreds of useless things to Bulger in order to\r\ngive their little hands a chance to feel something so wonderful.\r\n\r\nFrom the little I have told you about the names of the Formifolk, dear\r\nfriends, you have no doubt understood that their names took their rise\r\nfrom some physical quality, defect, or peculiarity. Besides the names I\r\nhave already mentioned, I remember Sharp Chin, Long Nose, Silk Ears,\r\nSmooth Palms, Big Knuckle, Nail Off, Hammer Fist, Soft Touch,\r\nHole-in-Cheek, or Hole-in-chin (Dimple), Crooked Hair (Cowlick), and so\r\non, and so on.\r\n\r\nBut, to my amazement, one day, when asking the name of a young girl\r\nwhose long and delicate fingers had attracted my attention, I was\r\ninformed that her name was Singing Fingers, or, possibly, I might\r\ntranslate it Music Fingers.\r\n\r\nI had noticed that the Soodopsies had some idea of music, for the\r\nchildren often amused themselves dancing, and, while so engaged, beat\r\ntime with their finger tips on each other’s cheeks or foreheads.\r\n\r\nBut I was completely in the dark as to what they meant by Singing\r\nFingers, or why the young girl should have been so named; hence was I\r\ngreatly pleased to hear the maiden’s mother ask me whether I would like\r\nto feel one of her daughter’s songs, as she termed it. Upon my\r\nacquiescing, the mother approached me and proceeded to roll up the\r\nsleeves of my coat until she had laid my arms bare to the elbow, then\r\nshe took my arms and clasped them across my breast one above the other.\r\n\r\nBulger watched the proceeding with somewhat of displeasure in his eyes;\r\nhe had half an idea that these silent people might play some hurtful\r\ntrick upon his little master. But my smile soon disarmed his suspicion.\r\n\r\nSinging Fingers now drew near, and as her sweet face with its sightless\r\neyes turned full upon me I could hardly keep back the tears.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, why grieve for any one who seemed to be so perfectly happy? A\r\nsmile played around her dainty little mouth, disclosing her tiny silvery\r\nwhite teeth like so many real pearls, and her bosom rose and fell\r\nquickly, sending forth a faint breathing sound. She looked so like a\r\nradiant child of some other world that before I thought, I cried out,—\r\n\r\n“Speak, Oh, speak, beautiful child!”\r\n\r\nIn an instant she drew back affrighted, for the sudden vibration of the\r\nair had startled her; but I reached out and touched her hand to give her\r\nto understand that she need fear nothing, and then she drew near to me\r\nagain. Suddenly her beautiful hands with their long, frail, delicate\r\nfingers were lifted into the air, and she began to sway her body and to\r\nwave her hands in gentle and graceful motions as if keeping time with\r\nsome music. Gradually she drew nearer to me, and ever and anon her\r\nsilken finger tips touched my hands or arms as if they were a keyboard\r\nand she was about to begin to execute a soft and dainty bit of music;\r\nand I noticed that her fingers had some delightful perfume upon them.\r\nNow fast and faster the gentle taps rain upon me with rhythmic\r\nregularity. They soothe me, they thrill me, they reach my heart as if\r\nthey were the sweet notes of a flute or the soft tones of a singer’s\r\nvoice. The maiden is really singing to me! It seems to me that I can\r\nunderstand what she is saying, or, rather, thinking, as her dainty\r\nfinger tips fairly fly hither and thither, and I can hear her low\r\nbreathing grow louder and louder. Suddenly she leaves my hands and arms\r\nand I feel her gentle tapping on my cheeks and brow. So gently, Oh, so\r\ngently and soothingly her fingers touch me that at last they feel like\r\nrose leaves dragged across my face. The sensation is so delightful, so\r\nlike the soft touch of sleep to weary eyes, that I drop off in good\r\nearnest, and when, after a moment or so, I opened my eyes there sat the\r\nsmiling Formifolk waiting for me to awake, and there stood the\r\nradiant-visaged Singing Fingers in front of me, child-like, waiting to\r\nbe commended.\r\n\r\nAnd so you see, dear friends, that it is not so hard to be happy after\r\nall if you only set about it in the right way. The Formifolk seemed to\r\nhave set about it in the right way, judging by results, and they are the\r\nonly things we have to judge by. Some men will fish all day and not have\r\na bite, and some people will try their whole lives to catch happiness\r\nand not get any more than a nibble. They don’t use the right kind of\r\nbait. Let ’em try a kind act, a live one.\r\n\r\nThere was something I wanted to ask of the learned Barrel Brow, so the\r\nnext call I made on him I put this question to him:—\r\n\r\n“Is it possible, learned Master, that thy people have absolutely no\r\nguide, no overseer, no rulers?”\r\n\r\nThe great scholar of the Formifolk ceased reading the four books which\r\nlay opened before him—one under each hand and one under each foot—as I\r\nhanded him my silver tablet.\r\n\r\n“Little baron,” was his reply, “if there were only a bramble bush big\r\nenough for all you people of the upper world to jump into and if you\r\ncould only get rid of your ears too, you would soon be rid of your\r\nrulers who oppress you, who prey upon you; for no one would have any\r\ndesire to be a ruler if there was no one left to look at him and if he\r\ncouldn’t hear what the flatterers said about him. Vanity is the soil\r\nthat rulers spring from, as the mushrooms spring from the rich loam of\r\nour dark caverns. They pretend that it is the exercise of power that\r\nthey are so fond of. Believe them not. It is the gratification of their\r\nvanity and nothing else.\r\n\r\n“If it were only in thy power to say to every man who itched to be a\r\nruler,—\r\n\r\n“‘Well and good, brother, a ruler thou shalt be; but bear in mind, weak\r\nman, that when thou hast donned thy gaudy uniform and mounted thy gayly\r\ncaparisoned steed, when thou ridest at the head of troop and cavalcade\r\nwith ten thousand armed men following thee on foot, as slaves their\r\nmaster, and the plaudits of the foolish multitude rend the air, no eye\r\nshall witness the splendor of thy triumph, no ear catch a sound of the\r\ndeafening cheers,’ take my word for it, little baron, no one would want\r\nto be a ruler any more.\r\n\r\n“Where there are no rulers, little baron,” continued the learned Barrel\r\nBrow, “there can be no followers; where there are no followers, there\r\nwill be no quarrelling. When it becomes necessary in our nation we form\r\nthe Great Circle for deliberation. Each man writes out what he thinks on\r\nhis tablet. Then the opinions are read and counted and the majority\r\nrules. But we form the Great Circle only in times of urgent need.\r\nGenerally speaking, the smaller circles answer all the purposes; in\r\nfact, the family circle is in most cases quite sufficient.”\r\n\r\nI touched first Barrel Brow’s heart in token of my gratitude for the\r\nmany things which he had taught me, and then the back of his head to bid\r\nhim good-night. You may imagine his and my delight, dear friends, when\r\nthe wise Bulger raised himself upon his hind legs, and with his right\r\npaw also thanked the learned Barrel Brow, and then bade him good-night\r\nby a light tap on the back of his head.\r\n\r\n“Fortunate the traveller,” wrote the learned Soodopsy, “attended by so\r\nwise and watchful a companion! True, like a child, he goes on all fours,\r\nbut by so doing he brings his heart and his brains on the same level—the\r\nonly way for a man to wear them if he would do his fellow-creatures any\r\ngood. The trouble with thy people in the upper world, little baron, is\r\nthat they think too much. They clasp minds instead of clasping hands;\r\nthey send messengers with gifts instead of giving themselves. They hire\r\npeople to dance for them, to sing for them, to be merry for them. They\r\nwill not be satisfied until they have hired people to help them be\r\nsorry, to whom they may say, ‘My friend is dead; I loved him. Weep three\r\nwhole days for him.’”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XX\r\n\r\n  THIS IS A LONG AND A SAD CHAPTER.—IT TELLS HOW DEAR, GENTLE,\r\n    POUTING-LIP WAS LOST, AND HOW THE SOODOPSIES GRIEVED FOR HIM AND\r\n    WHOM THEY SUSPECTED.—BULGER GIVES A STRIKING PROOF OF HIS\r\n    WONDERFUL INTELLIGENCE WHICH ENABLES ME TO CONVINCE THE SOODOPSIES\r\n    THAT MY “DANCING SPECTRE” DID NOT CAUSE POUTING-LIP’S DEATH.—THE\r\n    TRUE TALE OF HIS TERRIBLE FATE.—WHAT FOLLOWS MY DISCOVERY.—HOW A\r\n    BEAUTIFUL BOAT IS BUILT FOR ME BY THE GRATEFUL SOODOPSIES, AND HOW\r\n    BULGER AND I BID ADIEU TO THE LAND OF THE MAKE-BELIEVE EYES.\r\n\r\n\r\n’Twas the custom in the City of Silver to “touch all around,” as it was\r\ncalled, before going to rest. The “touch all around” began in a certain\r\nquarter of the city and passed with wonderful rapidity from man to man.\r\nExactly how it was done I never could understand, but the purpose of the\r\nmysterious signalling was to make an actual count of all the Formifolk.\r\nIf a single one were missing, it would be most surely discovered by the\r\ntime the “touch all around” had been completed. It proceeded with\r\nlightning-like rapidity throughout the city, and then, if no return\r\nsignal was made, the people knew that everyone was in his proper place;\r\nthat no Soodopsy had lost his way or fallen ill in some unfrequented\r\npassage.\r\n\r\nI don’t think that I had more than dropped off to sleep when I was\r\naroused by Bulger’s gentle tugging at my sleeve. Rubbing my eyes, I sat\r\nup in bed and listened. Instantly my ear caught that faint, shuffling\r\nsound which was always perceptible when any number of the Formifolk were\r\nhurrying hither and thither over the polished silver pavement.\r\n\r\nI sprang out of bed and rushed to the door, Bulger close at my heels.\r\nWhat a strange sight confronted me! I could compare it to nothing save\r\nto the appearance of a large ant hill when some mischievous boy suddenly\r\ndrops a stone among the crowd of petty, patient, plodding people\r\npeacefully pursuing their work.\r\n\r\nIn an instant all is changed: lines are broken, workmen jostle workmen,\r\norder becomes disorder, regularity is changed to confusion. Hither and\r\nthither the affrighted creatures rush with waving feelers, seeking for\r\nthe cause of the mad outburst of terror.\r\n\r\nSo it was with the Formifolk as I looked out upon them. With\r\noutstretched hands and tremulously moving fingers they rushed from side\r\nto side, jostling and bumping one another, while a nameless dread was\r\ndepicted upon their upturned faces. Anon a group would halt, join hands,\r\nand begin to exchange thoughts by lightning-like pressures, tappings,\r\nand strokes, when others would dash against them, break them apart, and\r\nconfusion would reign greater than ever.\r\n\r\nBut gradually I noted that some sort of order seemed to be coming out of\r\nthe movements of this mad throng. Here and there groups of three and\r\nfour would form and clasp hands, then these smaller circles would break\r\nand form into larger ones, and I noted too that this ever-increasing\r\ncircle was formed on the outside of the panic-stricken crowd, and as it\r\ngrew it shut them in so that when a fleeing Soodopsy hurtled up against\r\nthis steady line, his terror left him at once and he took his place in\r\nit. In a few moments the madly pushing, jostling throng had disappeared\r\nentirely and the whole city was girt round about by these long, steady\r\nlines.\r\n\r\nThe Great Circle had been formed.\r\n\r\nAfter half an hour the deliberation was completed, and, to my surprise,\r\nthe Great Circle broke up into squads and companies of fours and sixes\r\nand tens, and then each disappeared slowly and steadily with lock step,\r\npassing out of the City into the dark or only partially lighted chambers\r\nand passages that surrounded it. The search for the missing Soodopsy had\r\nbeen begun.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GIGANTIC TORTOISE THAT DEVOURED POUTING LIP.]\r\n\r\nIt was hours before the last squad had returned to the square and the\r\nGreat Circle had been formed again. Alas! the news was sad indeed. There\r\ncame no tidings of the missing man. He was lost forever; and with\r\nclasped hands and slow and heavy step the grieving Formifolk made their\r\nway back to their homes, where the sighing women and children were\r\nawaiting their coming. As Bulger and I went back to bed again, it almost\r\nseemed to me as if I could hear at times the deep and long-drawn sighs\r\nthat escaped from the gentle breasts of the sorrowing Soodopsies. I\r\nnoticed a very touching thing on the following day. It was that every\r\nman, woman, and child in the City of Silver grieved for the lost\r\nSoodopsy as if he were actually brother to each of them. Love was not as\r\nwith us, in the upper world, a thing bestowed upon those in whom we see\r\nour own faces repeated and in whose voices we heard our own ring out\r\nagain, sweet and clear as in our childhood; in other words, a love\r\nalmost of our very selves. Oh, no! while it was true that a mother’s\r\ntouch was most tender to her own child, yet no little hand stretched out\r\nto her went without its caress. She was mother to them all; to her they\r\nwere all beautiful, and as their little frocks were all woven in the\r\nsame loom, there never could come into her mind a temptation to feel\r\nwhether a rich neighbor’s child was playing with hers, and that\r\ntherefore it ought to receive a more loving caress. In that portion of\r\nthe city where the children had their playgrounds the silver pavement\r\nwas in some places marked off with raised lines and letters, something\r\nafter the manner of our hop scotch, for the purpose of a game which was\r\nvery popular with the little Soodopsies. Its name is hard to translate,\r\nbut it meant something like “Little Bogyman,” and many an hour had\r\nBulger and I stood there watching these silent little gnomes at play,\r\nfascinated by the wonderful skill which they would display in feigning\r\nthe drawing near of the Little Bogyman, their hiding from him, his\r\nstealthy approach, the increasing danger, the attack, the escape, the\r\nnew dangers, wild flight, and mad pursuit. Fancy, therefore, my\r\nastonishment one morning to note that Bulger was coaxing me thither,\r\nalthough the place was quite deserted, the children being all at their\r\nlessons.\r\n\r\nBut, as it was a rule of mine always to humor Bulger’s whims, I went\r\npatiently along.\r\n\r\nIn a moment, as we came to the spot where the pavement was marked off\r\nand inscribed as I have explained, he halted and with an anxious whine\r\nbegan to play the game of “The Little Bogyman,” turning every now and\r\nthen to see what effect his actions had upon me.\r\n\r\nHe made no mistakes. As he entered each compartment, he rested his paw\r\nupon the raised letters as he had so often seen the children do with\r\ntheir little bare feet, and then mimicked with wonderful fidelity their\r\nactions, beginning with the first scent of danger and ending with mad\r\nterror at the close pursuit of the bogyman.\r\n\r\nI was more than surprised; I was bewildered by this piece of mimicry on\r\nBulger’s part. To my mind it boded some terrible accident to him, for I\r\nhave a superstitious notion that great danger to an animal’s life gives\r\nhim for the moment an almost human intelligence. It is nature caring for\r\nher own.\r\n\r\nBut all of a sudden the real truth in this case burst upon me: it was\r\nnot my dear little brother giving me to understand that some peril was\r\nthreatening him, but that some danger was hanging over my head, the more\r\nreal in that it was unseen and unsuspected by me.\r\n\r\nI called him to me and rewarded him with a caress. He was overjoyed to\r\nnote that I had apparently understood him. I now made haste to seek out\r\nBarrel Brow. He was surprised to feel my salutation. In a moment or so I\r\nhad told him all. Nor was he slow in detecting my excitement. He, no\r\ndoubt, felt that in the changed character of my handwriting.\r\n\r\n“Calm thyself, little baron,” he wrote. “The wise Bulger has told thee\r\nthe truth. Thy life is in danger. I had resolved to send for thee this\r\nvery day to warn thee of it: to bid thee quit the land of the Formifolk\r\nin all haste, for the notion has spread among our people that it was the\r\ndancing spectre at thy heels which caused the death of the gentle\r\nPouting Lip, who disappeared so mysteriously the other day. I therefore\r\ncounsel thee that thou make ready at once and quit our city to-morrow\r\nbefore the clocks rouse the people from their sleep.”\r\n\r\nI thanked Barrel Brow, and promised that I would heed his advice,\r\nalthough I confessed to him that I would fain have bided a few weeks\r\nlonger, there were so many things in and about the wonderful City of\r\nSilver that I had not seen. But I owed it to the dear hearts of my own\r\nworld to take the best care of my life, insignificant though it might\r\nappear to me.\r\n\r\nThen, again, I felt that it would be madness to attempt to reason with\r\nthe Soodopsies. To them the dancing spectre at my heels was a real being\r\nof flesh and blood, although they had not been able to seize him, and it\r\nwas really natural for them to suspect that we had made away with\r\nPouting Lip.\r\n\r\nCalling out to Bulger to follow me, I left Barrel Brow’s home, resolved\r\nto make one more round of the wonderful city, and then pack up some food\r\nand clothing and be all ready for a start before the clocks began their\r\ntapping.\r\n\r\nI should explain, dear friends, that, as happens in all cities, the\r\npeople of this one imagined at times that they hadn’t quite elbow room\r\nenough, and hence they surveyed other chambers, and set up new\r\ncandelabra within them, in order to chase the cold and dampness away,\r\nand make them fit for human habitations.\r\n\r\nIn the last one which they had in this way annexed to their fair city,\r\nfitting it with a silver doorway and tiling the floor with polished\r\nplates of the same beautiful metal, they had discovered a hard mound\r\napparently of rock in one corner, and had resolved that they would come\r\nsome day with their drills and picks and begin the task of removing this\r\nmound.\r\n\r\nA strange inclination came upon me to visit this new chamber in order to\r\ninspect the work of these eyeless workmen, and see how far they had\r\nproceeded with their task of transforming a cold and rocky vault into a\r\nbright, warm, healthy habitation.\r\n\r\nImagine my surprise to hear Bulger utter a low growl as we reached the\r\nentrance, and I put out my hand to swing the door open, for the\r\nSoodopsies were not at work there that day, and the place was as silent\r\nas a tomb.\r\n\r\nGlancing through the grating, a sight met my gaze which caused my flesh\r\nto creep and my hair to stiffen. What think ye was it? Why, the mound in\r\nthe corner was rocking and swaying, and from underneath one end issued a\r\nloud and angry hissing. I’m no coward, if I do say it myself, but this\r\nwas just a little too much for ordinary or even extraordinary flesh to\r\nbear without flinching. I staggered back with a suppressed cry of\r\nhorror, and was upon the point of breaking into a mad flight, when the\r\nthought flashed through my mind that the door was securely fastened, and\r\nthat there would be no danger in my taking another look at the terrible\r\nmonster thus caged in this chamber.\r\n\r\nA great snake-like head was now lifted from beneath one edge of the\r\nmound, on the end of a long, swaying neck. Its great round eyes, big as\r\nan ox’s, stared with a dull, cold, glassy look from wall to wall, and\r\nthen, with an awful outburst of hissing, the whole mound was suddenly\r\nraised upon four great legs, thick as posts, and ending in terrible\r\nclaws, and borne rocking and swaying into the centre of the chamber.\r\n\r\nWhat was this terrible monster, and where had it come from?\r\n\r\nWhy, I saw through it all now at a glance. It was a gigantic tortoise,\r\neight feet long by five wide, at least, and once an inhabitant of the\r\nupper world. Thousands and thousands of years ago, by the coming of the\r\nawful fields of ice, it had been forced to fly from certain death by\r\ncrawling down into these underground caverns. Here, chilled and numbed\r\nby the dampness and cold, it had fallen asleep, and would have continued\r\nto sleep on for other ages to come, had not the industrious Formifolk\r\nlighted the clusters of burning jets of gas in the monster’s bedroom.\r\nGradually the warmth had penetrated the roof of shell made thicker by\r\nearth and layers of broken rock, which the tooth of time had dropped\r\nupon it, and reached his great heart, and set it beating again slowly,\r\nvery slowly, but faster and faster, until he really felt that he had\r\nawakened from his long sleep.\r\n\r\nBy a terrible misfortune, Pouting Lip, the gentle Soodopsy, had happened\r\nto be left behind when his brother laborers quit work, and the new\r\nsilver doors of the chamber had been closed upon him.\r\n\r\nOh, it was terrible to think of, but true it must have been—the poor\r\nlittle Soodopsy, shut in by his own eyeless folk in this chamber, which\r\nhe was helping to beautify by his patient skill, had served to satisfy\r\nthe hunger of this awful monster, after his long ages of fasting.\r\n\r\nBut why, you ask, dear friends, was all this not discovered when the\r\nGreat Circle had been formed, and the search was made for him? Simply\r\nbecause the monster, after devouring the lost Soodopsy, retreated to his\r\nnest and drew the dirt and crumbled rock up around him with his gigantic\r\nflippers, and went to sleep again, as all gorged reptiles do, so that\r\nwhen the searchers entered the new chamber all was as they had left it,\r\nthe mound of rock, as they had supposed it to be, in the corner\r\nundisturbed.\r\n\r\nWith Bulger at my heels I now turned and ran with such mad haste to\r\nBarrel Brow’s, that the whole city was thrown into the wildest disorder,\r\nfor, of course, they had felt me fly past them.\r\n\r\nWith all the quickness I could command, I wrote an account of what I had\r\nwitnessed, and when Barrel Brow communicated it to the assembled\r\nSoodopsies, a thousand hands flew into the air, in token of mingled\r\nfright and wonder, and a wild rush was made for Bulger and me, and we\r\nwere well-nigh smothered with kisses and caresses.\r\n\r\nThe moment the excitement had quieted down a little, a Great Circle was\r\nimmediately formed, and I was honored with a place in it, and when my\r\ntablet was passed about, a thousand hands made signs of assent.\r\n\r\nMy plan was a simple one: it was to make a pipe connection between\r\nUphaslok and the new chamber, and to turn the deadly vapor into the\r\nsleeping apartment of the gigantic monster. In this manner his despatch\r\nwould be a happy one, merely a beginning of another one of his long\r\nnaps, so far as he would know any thing about it.\r\n\r\nThis was done at once, care first being taken to make the doors of the\r\nnew chamber perfectly air tight. I was the first to enter the cavern\r\nafter the execution of the monster, and found, to my delight, that my\r\nestimate of his length and width was correct almost to an inch.\r\n\r\nI always had a wonderful eye for dimension and distances.\r\n\r\nSeeing Bulger raising himself upon his hind legs, and make an effort to\r\ndislodge something from the wall, I drew near to assist him.\r\n\r\nAlas! it was dear, gentle, Pouting Lip’s tablet. He had been writing\r\nupon it, and as the terrible monster advanced upon him, he had reached\r\nup and hung it upon a silver pin on the wall. When the Soodopsies read\r\nwhat their poor brother had written, there they all sat down and wrung\r\ntheir hands in silent but awful grief: it ran as follows:—\r\n\r\n“O my people! why have ye abandoned me? The air trembles; the whole\r\nplace is filled with suffocating odor. Must I die? Alas, I fear it! and\r\nyet I would so love to feel my dear ones’ touches once more! The ground\r\ntrembles; a stifling breath is puffed into my face; I am wearied, almost\r\nfainting, by trying to escape it. I can write no more. Don’t grieve too\r\nlong over me. It was my fault. I stayed behind, when I should have\r\nfollowed. Oh, horrible, horrible! Farewell! I’m going now. A loving\r\ntouch to all—farewell!”\r\n\r\nAfter waiting a few days for the grief of the Formifolk to lighten a\r\nlittle, I asked them to send a number of their most skilful workmen to\r\nassist me in removing the magnificent shell from the dead monster whose\r\nbody was fed to the fishes. They not only did this, but they also\r\noffered to transform the shell into a beautiful boat for me, so that\r\nwhen I resolved to bid them adieu, I might sail away from the City of\r\nSilver and not be obliged to trudge along the Marble Highway. The work\r\nwent on apace. At first the polishers began their task, and in a few\r\ndays the mighty carapace glowed like a lady’s comb. Then the dainty and\r\ncunning craftsmen in silver began their part of the work, and ere many\r\ndays the shell was fitted with a silver prow curiously wrought, like a\r\nswan’s neck and head, while quaintly carved trimmings ran here and\r\nthere, and a dainty pair of silver sculls with a silver rudder,\r\nbeautifully chased, from which ran two little silken ropes, were added\r\nto the outfit. I never had seen anything half so rich and rare, and I\r\nwas as proud of it as a young king of his throne before he finds it is\r\nso much like my ship of shell.\r\n\r\nAt last the day came when I was to bid the gentle Soodopsies a long\r\nfarewell.\r\n\r\nThey lined the shore as Bulger and I proceeded to take our place in the\r\nbark of shell which sat upon the water like a thing of life.\r\n\r\nIt was with a great show of dignity that Bulger took his position in the\r\nstern with the tiller-ropes in his mouth, ready to pull on either side\r\nas I might direct; and setting the silver oars in place, I threw my\r\nweight upon them, and away we glided, swiftly and noiselessly, over the\r\nsurface of the dark and sluggish stream.\r\n\r\nIn a few moments nothing but a faint glimmer was left to remind us of\r\nthe wonderful City of Silver, where the silent Formifolk live and love\r\nand labor without ever a thought that human beings could be any happier\r\nthan they. Dear, happy folk, they have solved a mighty problem which we\r\nof the upper world are still struggling over.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\n  HOW WE WERE LIGHTED ON OUR WAY DOWN THE DARK AND SILENT\r\n    RIVER.—SUDDEN AND FIERCE ONSLAUGHT UPON OUR BEAUTIFUL BOAT OF\r\n    SHELL.—A FIGHT FOR LIFE AGAINST TERRIBLE ODDS, AND HOW BULGER\r\n    STOOD BY ME THROUGH IT ALL.—COLD AIR AND LUMPS OF ICE.—OUR ENTRY\r\n    INTO THE CAVERN WHENCE THEY CAME.—THE BOAT OF SHELL COMES TO THE\r\n    END OF ITS VOYAGE.—SUNLIGHT IN THE WORLD WITHIN A WORLD, AND ALL\r\n    ABOUT THE WONDERFUL WINDOW THROUGH WHICH IT POURED, AND THE\r\n    MYSTERIOUS LAND IT LIGHTED.\r\n\r\n\r\nI dare say, dear friends, that you are puzzling your brains to think out\r\nhow it was possible for me to row away from the wonderful city of the\r\nFormifolk without running our boat continually ashore. Ah, you forget\r\nthat the keen-eyed Bulger was at the helm, and that it was not the first\r\ntime that he had piloted me through darkness impenetrable to my eyes;\r\nbut more than this: I soon discovered that the plashing of my silver\r\noars kept my little friends, the fire lizards, in a constant state of\r\nalarm, and although I couldn’t hear the crackling of their tails, yet\r\nthe tiny flashes of light served to outline the shore admirably. So I\r\npulled away with a will, and down this dark and silent river, for there\r\nwas a current, although hardly perceptible, Bulger and I were borne\r\nalong in the beautiful bark of tortoise shell with its prow of carved\r\nand burnished silver.\r\n\r\nDuring my sojourn in the Land of the Soodopsies I had one day, while\r\ncalling upon the learned Barrel Brow, noticed a beautifully carved\r\nsilver hand-lamp of the Pompeian pattern among his curiosities. I asked\r\nhim if he knew what it was. He replied that he did, adding that it had\r\ndoubtless been brought from the upper world by his people, and he begged\r\nme to accept it as a keepsake. I did so, and upon leaving the City of\r\nSilver, I filled it with fish-oil and fitted a silken wick to it. It was\r\nwell that I had done so, for after a while the fire lizards disappeared\r\nentirely, and Bulger and I would have been left in total darkness, had I\r\nnot drawn forth my beautiful silver lamp, lighted it, and suspended it\r\nfrom the beak of the silver swan which curved its graceful neck above\r\nthe bow of our boat.\r\n\r\nAfter lying on my oars long enough to set some food before Bulger and\r\npartake of some myself, I again started on my voyage down the silent\r\nriver, no longer shrouded in impenetrable gloom.\r\n\r\nI had not taken over half a dozen strokes, when suddenly one of my oars\r\nwas almost twisted out of my hand by a vicious tug, from some inhabitant\r\nof these dark and sluggish waters. I resolved to quicken my stroke in\r\norder to escape another such a wrench, for the silver oars fashioned by\r\nthe Soodopsies for me were of very delicate make, intended only for very\r\ngentle usage. Suddenly another vicious snap was made at my other oar;\r\nand this time the animal succeeded in retaining its hold, for I dared\r\nnot attempt to wrench the oar out of its grip, for fear of breaking it.\r\nIt was a large crustacean of the crab family, and its milk-white shell\r\ngave it a ghost-like look as it struggled about in the black waters,\r\nfiercely intent to keep its hold upon the oar. The next instant a\r\nsimilar creature had fastened firmly upon my other oar, and there I sat\r\nutterly helpless. But worse than this, the dark waters were now fairly\r\nalive with these white armored guards of this underworld stream, each\r\napparently bent upon setting an immediate end to my progress through\r\ntheir domain. They now began a series of furious efforts to lay hold of\r\nthe sides of my boat with their huge claws, but happily its polished\r\nsurface made this impossible for them to accomplish.\r\n\r\nUp to this moment Bulger had not stirred a muscle or uttered a sound,\r\nbut now a sharp growl from him told me that something serious had\r\nhappened at his end of the boat. It was serious indeed, for several of\r\nthe largest of the fierce crustaceans had laid hold of the rudder and\r\nwere wrenching it from side to side as if to tear it off. Every attempt\r\nof course caused a tug at the tiller-ropes held between Bulger’s teeth;\r\nbut, bracing himself firmly, he resisted their furious efforts as well\r\nas he could, and succeeded in saving the rudder for the time being.\r\n\r\nAll of a sudden our frail bark of shell crashed into some sort of\r\nobstruction, and came to a dead standstill. Peering into the darkness,\r\nto my horror I saw that the wily enemy had spanned the river with chains\r\nmade up of living links by each laying hold of his neighbor’s claw, the\r\nchain thus formed being then rendered almost as strong as steel by the\r\ninterweaving of their double rows of small hooked legs.\r\n\r\nOur advance was not only blocked, but death, an awful death, seemed to\r\nbe staring us in the face; for what possible hope of escape could there\r\nbe if Bulger and I should leap into the water, now alive with these fast\r\nswimming creatures, whirling their huge claws about in search for some\r\nway to get at us. From the brave manner in which Bulger was holding the\r\nmadly swinging helm, I saw that he was determined not to surrender. But\r\nalas, bravery is but a sorry thing for two to fight a thousand with! And\r\nyet I had not lost my head—don’t think that. True, I was hard pressed;\r\nthe very dust of the balance, if thicker on their side, might make my\r\nscale kick the beam.\r\n\r\nI had hauled both oars into the boat by reaching over and beating off\r\nthe claws fastened upon them, and had up to this moment driven back\r\nevery one of the fierce creatures which had succeeded in throwing one of\r\nhis claws over the edge of the boat; but now, to my horror, I felt that\r\nour little craft was being slowly but surely drawn stern first toward\r\nthe river bank. In order to accomplish this, the crustaceans had thrown\r\nout a line composed of their bodies gripped together, and had made it\r\nfast to the rudder. Not an instant was to be lost!\r\n\r\nOnce upon the river bank, the fierce creatures would swarm around us by\r\nthe tens of thousands, drag us down, pinch us to death, and tear us\r\npiecemeal!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SAILING AWAY FROM THE LAND OF THE SOODOPSIES.]\r\n\r\nAn idea flashed upon me—it was this: it is folly to attempt to resist\r\nthese countless swarms of crustaceans by the use of one pair of weak\r\nhands, even though they be aided by Bulger’s keen and willing teeth. We\r\nshould, after a brief struggle, go down as the brave man in the sewer\r\nwent down, when the famished rats leaped upon him from every side at\r\nonce, or as the stray buffalo goes down when the pack of ravenous wolves\r\ncloses up its circle about him. If I am to save my life, it must be by\r\nstriking a blow that will reach every one of these small but fierce\r\nenemies at the same instant, and thus paralyze them, or, at least,\r\nbewilder them, until I can succeed in making my escape!\r\n\r\nQuickly drawing my brace of pistols, I held their muzzles close to the\r\nwater, and discharged them at the same instant. The effect was terrific.\r\nLike a crash of a terrible thunderbolt, the report burst forth and\r\nechoed through these vast and silent chambers, until it seemed as if the\r\ngreat vaulted roof of rock had by some awful convulsion of nature been\r\ncast roaring and rattling down upon the face of these black and sluggish\r\nwaters! When the smoke had cleared away, a strange but welcome sight met\r\nmy gaze. Tens of thousands of the huge crabs floated lifeless upon the\r\nsurface of the river, with their shells split by the concussion the full\r\nlength of their bodies.\r\n\r\nIt proved to have been a masterly stroke on my part, and, dear friends,\r\nyou will believe me when I tell you that I drew a deep breath as I set\r\nmy silver oars against the thole-pins, and, having worked my boat clear\r\nof the swarms of stunned crustaceans, rowed away for dear life!\r\n\r\nDear life! Ah, yes, dear life, for whose life is not dear to him, even\r\nthough it be dark and gloomy at times? Is there not always something, or\r\nsome one, to live for? Is there not always a glimmer of hope that the\r\nmorrow’s sun will go up brighter than it did this morning? Well, anyway,\r\nI repeat that I rowed away for dear life, while Bulger held the\r\ntiller-ropes and kept our frail bark of polished shell in the middle of\r\nthe stream.\r\n\r\nWhether the air was actually colder, or whether it was merely the\r\nnatural chill that so often strikes the human heart after it has been\r\nbeating and throbbing with alternate hope and fear, I couldn’t say at\r\nthe time; but I knew this much, that I suddenly found myself suffering\r\nfrom the cold.\r\n\r\nFor the first time since my descent into the World within a World, the\r\nair nipped my finger-tips; that soft, balmy, June-like atmosphere was\r\ngone, and I made haste to put on my fur-trimmed top-coat, which I had\r\nnot made much use of lately.\r\n\r\nAt that moment one of my oars struck against some hard substance\r\nfloating in the waters. I put out my hand to feel of it. To my great\r\nsurprise it proved to be a lump of ice, and very soon another and\r\nanother went floating by us.\r\n\r\nWe were most surely entering a region where it was cold enough to make\r\nice. I was not sorry for this; for, to tell the truth, Bulger and I were\r\nboth beginning to feel the effects of our long sojourn in the rocky\r\nchambers of this under world, whose atmosphere, though soft and warm,\r\nyet lacked the elasticity of the open air.\r\n\r\nIce caverns would be a complete change, and the cold air would, no\r\ndoubt, send our blood tingling through our veins just as if we were out\r\na-sleighing in the upper world on a winter’s night, when the stars\r\ntwinkle over our heads and the snow crystals creak beneath our runners.\r\n\r\nSoon now huge icicles began to dot the roof of rock that spanned the\r\nriver, and shafts and columns of ice dimly visible along the shore\r\nseemed to be standing there like silent sentries, watching our boat as\r\nit threaded its way through the ever-narrowing channel. And now, too, a\r\nfaint glow of light reached us from I knew not where, so that by\r\nstraining my eyes I could see that the river had taken a sweep, and\r\nentered a vast cavern with roof and walls of ice fretted and carved into\r\nfantastic depths and niches and shelves and cornices, with here and\r\nthere shapes so fanciful that it seemed to me I had entered some vast\r\nhall of statuary, where hero and warrior, nymph and maiden, shepherd and\r\nbird-catcher, filled these shelves and niches in glorious array. Farther\r\nadvance by water was impossible, for the blocks of ice, knitted together\r\nlike a floe, closed the river completely. I therefore determined to make\r\na landing—draw my boat upon the shore, and continue my journey on foot.\r\n\r\nThe mysterious light which up to this moment had shed its pale glimmer\r\nlike an arctic night upon the roofs and walls of ice of these silent\r\nchambers now began to strengthen so that Bulger and I had no difficulty\r\nin picking our way along the shore. In fact, we crossed and recrossed\r\nthe river itself when the whim seized us, for it now went winding on\r\nahead of us, like a broad ribbon of ice through caverns and corridors.\r\n\r\nSuddenly I came to a halt and stood as motionless as the fantastic forms\r\nof ice surrounding me. What could it mean? Were my eyes weakened by my\r\nlong sojourn in the World within a World, playing me cruel tricks?\r\nSurely there can be no mistake! I whispered to myself. That light yonder\r\nwhich pours its glorious effulgence upon those spires and pinnacles,\r\nthose towers and turrets of ice, is the sunshine of the upper world! Can\r\nit be that my marvellous underground journey is ended, that I stand upon\r\nthe threshold of the upper world once more?\r\n\r\nBulger, too, recognizes this flood of sunshine, and breaking out into a\r\nfit of joyous barking, dashes on ahead, to be the first one to feel its\r\ngentle warmth after our long journey through the dark and silent\r\npassages of the World within a World.\r\n\r\nBut I dare not trust my eyes, and fearing lest he should fall into some\r\nambush or meet with some dread accident, I called him back to me.\r\n\r\nTogether we hurry along as rapidly as possible. Now I note that we are\r\ndrawing near to the end of the vast corridor through which we have been\r\nmaking our way for some time, and that we stand upon the portal of a\r\nmighty subterranean region lighted with real sunlight. It stretches away\r\nas far as the eye can reach, and so high is the roof that spans this\r\nvast under world that I cannot see whether it be of ice or not. All that\r\nI can see is that through one of its sloping sides there streams a\r\nmighty torrent of sunlight, which pours its splendor with unstinting\r\nhand upon the wide highways, the broad terraces, the sheer parapets, and\r\nthe sloping banks which diversify this ice world. Can it be that one\r\nside of this mighty mountain which nature has here hollowed out and set\r\nlike a peaked roof over this vast subterranean region, is a gigantic\r\nwindow of ice itself through which the sunlight of the outer world\r\nstreams in this grand way like a silent cataract of light, like a deluge\r\nof sunshine? No, this could not be; for now upon a second look I saw\r\nthat this flood of light thus streaming through the side of the mountain\r\ncame through it like a mighty pencil of rays, and striking the opposite\r\nwalls with its brilliancy a hundred-fold increased, rebounded in a\r\nthousand directions, flooding the whole region with its effulgence and\r\ndying away in faint and pearl-like glimmer in the vast approach where I\r\nhad first noted it.\r\n\r\nAnd therefore I understood that nature must have set a gigantic lens,\r\ntwice a thousand feet or more in diameter, in the sloping side of this\r\nhollow mountain—a perfect lens of purest rock crystal, which, gathering\r\nin its mysterious bosom the sunlight of the outer world, threw\r\nit—intensely radiant and dazzling white—into the gloomy depths of this\r\nWorld within a World, so that when the sun went up out there, it went up\r\nin here as well, but became cold as it was beautiful, bringing no\r\nwarmth, no other cheer save light, to this subterranean region which for\r\nthousands of centuries had lain locked in the crystal embrace of frozen\r\nlakes and brooks and rivers and torrents and waterfalls, once bubbling\r\nand flowing and rushing headlong through fair lands of the upper world,\r\nbut suddenly checked in their course by some bursting forth of mighty\r\npent-up forces, and turned downward into these icy depths condemned to\r\neverlasting rest and silence, their crystals locked in a sleep that\r\nnever would know an awaking, mocked in their dreams by this mysterious\r\nsunlight that came with the smile and the fair, winsome look of the\r\nreal, and yet was so powerless to set them free as once it did when the\r\nspringtime came in the upper world. All these thoughts and many others\r\nbesides flitted through my mind as I stood looking up at that mighty\r\nlens in its setting of mightier rock.\r\n\r\nAnd so deeply impressed was I by the sight of such a great flood of\r\nsunlight pouring through this gigantic bull’s eye which nature had set\r\nin the rocky side of the hollow mountain peak and illumining this under\r\nworld, that the longer I gazed upon the wonderful spectacle the more\r\nfirmly inthralled my senses became by it.\r\n\r\nThe deep silence, the deliciously pure air, the ever-varying tints of\r\nthe light as the mighty ice columns acting the part of prisms, literally\r\nfilled those vast chambers with the rainbow’s glorious glow, imparted\r\nunto the spell resting upon me such unearthly power that it might have\r\nheld me there until my limbs hardened into icy crystals and my eyes\r\nlooked out with a frozen stare, had not the ever-watchful Bulger given a\r\ngentle tug at the skirt of my coat and aroused me from my inthralling\r\nmeditation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\n  THE PALACE OF ICE IN THE GOLDEN SUNLIGHT, AND WHAT I IMAGINED IT\r\n    MIGHT CONTAIN.—HOW WE WERE HALTED BY A COUPLE OF QUAINTLY CLAD\r\n    SENTINELS.—THE KOLTYKWERPS.—HIS FRIGID MAJESTY KING GELIDUS.—MORE\r\n    ABOUT THE ICE PALACE, TOGETHER WITH A DESCRIPTION OF THE\r\n    THRONE-ROOM.—OUR RECEPTION BY THE KING AND HIS DAUGHTER\r\n    SCHNEEBOULE.—BRIEF MENTION OF BULLIBRAIN, OR LORD HOT HEAD.\r\n\r\n\r\nScarcely had I advanced a hundred yards beyond the portal where I had\r\nhalted when happening to turn my eyes to the other side, a sight met\r\nthem which sent a thrill of wonder and delight through my form. There\r\nupon the highest terrace stood a palace of ice, its slender minarets,\r\nits high-lifted towers, its rounded turrets, its spacious platform, and\r\nits broad flights of steps all glittering in the sunlight as if\r\ngem-studded and jewel-set.\r\n\r\nIt was a spectacle to stir the most indifferent heart, let alone one so\r\nfull of ardor and buoyancy as mine. But ah, dear friends, even admitting\r\nthat I can succeed in awakening in your minds even a faint conception of\r\nthe beauty of this ice palace, as the sunlight fell full upon it at that\r\nmoment, how can I ever hope to give you an idea of the unearthly beauty\r\nof this palace of ice and its glorious surroundings when the moon went\r\nup in the outer world at a later hour and its pale, mysterious light was\r\npoured through the mighty lens in the mountain side, and fell with\r\ncelestial shimmer upon these walls of ice?\r\n\r\nBut the one thought that oppressed me now was: Can this beautiful abode\r\nbe without a tenant, without a living soul within its wonderful halls\r\nand chambers? Or, may not its dwellers, overtaken by the pitiless cold,\r\nsit with wide-opened eyes and icy glare, stark as marble in chairs of\r\nice, white frosted hair pressed against icy cushions, and hands\r\nstiffened around crystal cups filled with frozen wine of topaz hue,\r\nwhile the harper’s fingers cling cramped to the wires stiff as the wires\r\nthemselves, and the last tones of the singer’s voice lie in feathery\r\ncrystals of frozen breath white at his feet?\r\n\r\nCome what may, I resolved to lift the crystal knocker that might hang on\r\nthe outer door of this palace of ice and awaken the castellan, if his\r\nslumber were not that of death. In a few moments I had crossed the level\r\nspace between me and the first terrace, which it would be necessary for\r\nme to scale in order to reach the second and then the third upon which\r\nstood the palace of ice.\r\n\r\nImagine my more than surprise upon finding myself now at the foot of a\r\nmagnificent flight of steps, hewn into the ice with a master hand, and\r\nleading to the terrace above.\r\n\r\nSpringing lightly up this flight with Bulger close at my heels, I\r\nsuddenly set eyes upon two of the quaintest-looking human beings that I\r\never remembered seeing in all my travels. They looked for all the world\r\nlike two big animated snowballs, being clad from top to toe in garments\r\nmade of snow-white fleece, their skull-caps likewise of white fur,\r\nleaving only their faces visible. In his right hand each of them carried\r\na very prettily shaped flint axe, mounted upon a helve of polished bone.\r\n\r\nStriding up to me and swinging their axes over my head in altogether too\r\nclose proximity to my poll to be particularly pleasant, one of them\r\ncries out,—\r\n\r\n“Halt, sir! Unless his frigid Majesty Gelidus, King of the Koltykwerps,\r\nawaits thy coming, his guards will, at a signal from us, roll a few\r\nthousand tons of ice down upon thee if thou darest proceed another step.\r\nTherefore, stand fast and tell us who thou art and whether thou art\r\nexpected.”\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen,” said I, “kindly lower those axes of yours and I will\r\nconvince you that his frigid Majesty hath nothing to dread in me, for I\r\nam none other than the very small but very noble and very famous\r\nSebastian von Troomp, commonly known as ‘Little Baron Trump.’”\r\n\r\n“Never heard of thee in all my life,” said both of the guards as with\r\none voice.\r\n\r\n“But I have of you, gentlemen,” I continued,—for now I recollected what\r\nthe learned Don Fum had said about the frozen land of the Koltykwerps,\r\nor Cold Bodies,—“and as proof of my peaceful intent, like a true knight\r\nI now offer you my hand, and beg that you will conduct me into the\r\npresence of his frigid Majesty.”\r\n\r\nNo sooner had the guard standing next me drawn off his glove and grasped\r\nmy hand, than he let it loose again with a cry of fright.\r\n\r\n“Zounds! Man, art thou on fire? Why, thy hand burned me like the flame\r\nof a lamp!”\r\n\r\n“Why, no, my friend,” said I quietly; “that’s my ordinary temperature.”\r\n\r\n“And thy companion?”\r\n\r\n“Hath even a warmer heart than I have,” was my reply.\r\n\r\n“Well, our word for it, little baron,” exclaimed one of the guards with\r\na chuckle, “there will be no place for thee except in the meat quarry.\r\nPossibly after thou hast been cooled off for a week or so, his frigid\r\nMajesty will be able to have thee about!”\r\n\r\nThis was not a very cheerful prospect, for I had no particular desire to\r\nbe laid away in the royal ice-box for a week or so. Anyway, the only\r\nthing to be done was to insist upon being conducted at once into the\r\npresence of the King of the Koltykwerps, and abide by his decision.\r\n\r\nOne of the guards having saluted me by presenting his battle-axe in real\r\nmilitary style, faced about and began to ascend the grand staircase with\r\nintent to announce my arrival to his frigid Majesty, while the other\r\ninformed me that he would conduct me as far as the perron of the palace.\r\n\r\nI was wonderstruck with the beauty of the three staircases leading up to\r\nthe ice palace. Massive balustrades with curiously carved balusters\r\nspringing from towering pedestals, crowned with beautiful lamps, all,\r\nall, I say, all and everything, to the crystal-clear sides of the lamps\r\nthemselves, was fashioned from blocks of ice. It proved to be a good\r\nclimb to the top of the third terrace, and I was not put out when the\r\nguard solemnly lowered his battle-axe of flint to bring me to a\r\nstandstill.\r\n\r\nThe sun in the upper world was, no doubt, nearing the horizon, for a\r\ndeep and beautiful twilight suddenly sank upon the icy dominions of King\r\nGelidus, and, to my surprise and delight, through the great slabs of\r\ncrystal-clear ice which served for windows to the palace, streamed a\r\nsoft radiance as if a thousand wax tapers were burning in the chambers\r\nand galleries in-doors. It was a sight to gladden the eyes of any\r\nmortal; but if I had been spellbound by the beauty of its exterior, how\r\nshall I tell you, dear friends, of the curious splendor of the interior\r\nof Gelidus’ palace of ice, as it burst upon me when I had crossed its\r\nthreshold?\r\n\r\nHallway led into hallway, chamber opened into chamber, through portals\r\ngracefully arched, and winding staircases climbed to upper rooms, while\r\nhanging from lofty ceilings or resting on graceful pedestals, were a\r\nthousand alabaster lamps, shedding light and perfume upon this glorious\r\nhome of his frigid Majesty Gelidus, King of the Koltykwerps. Long rows\r\nof retainers, all in snow-white fur, lined the wide hallway, as the\r\nguards conducted Bulger and me into the palace and bowed in silence as\r\nwe passed.\r\n\r\nTo my more than wonder, I saw that the inner rooms were most sumptuously\r\nfurnished, chairs and divans being scattered here and there, all covered\r\nwith superb skins of white fur, while the floor, too, was carpeted with\r\nthem, and as the soft radiance of the alabaster lamps fell upon these\r\nmagnificent pelts and set ten thousand jewels in the walls and ceilings\r\nof ice, I was ready to admit that I had never seen anything half so\r\nbeautiful. And yet I was still outside the throne-room of his frigid\r\nMajesty!\r\n\r\nAt length we came to one end of a broad hallway which seemed shut off\r\nfrom the rest of the palace by a wall thickly incrusted with strings of\r\ngreat diamonds, each as big as a goose-egg, extending from the ceiling\r\nto the floor, and turning back the shimmer of the lamps with such a\r\nflood of crystalline radiance that my eyes involuntarily closed before\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThink of my amazement when the two guards, laying hold of this wall of\r\njewels, as I deemed it, drew it to the right and left till there was\r\nroom for me to pass. What I had taken for a wall of jewels was but a\r\ncurtain made up of round bits of ice strung upon strings and hanging\r\nlike a shower of diamonds there before me, as they glittered in the\r\nlight of the lamps each side of them.\r\n\r\nI now stood in the throne-room of his frigid Majesty, the King of the\r\nKoltykwerps. Now I realized that what I had seen elsewhere in his palace\r\nof ice was in reality but a sample of its magnificence, for here the\r\nsplendor of King Gelidus’ castle burst upon me in its fullest strength.\r\nImagine a great round chamber lighted with the soft flames of perfumed\r\noil, streaming from a hundred alabaster lamps, the walls lined with\r\nbroad divans covered with snow-white pelts, the floors thickly carpeted\r\nwith the same glorious rugs, while on one side, glittering in the\r\nshimmer of the hundred massive lamps, stands the icy throne of the King\r\nof the Koltykwerps, decked with snow-white skins, and he upon it, with\r\nSchneeboule, his fair daughter, sitting at his feet, and all around and\r\nabout him, group-wise, a hundred Koltykwerps, the king, the princess,\r\nand the courtiers all clad in skins whiter than the driven snow, and\r\nyou, dear friends, will have some faint idea of the splendor of the\r\nscene which burst upon me as the two guards drew aside the strands of\r\nice jewels at the end of the hallway in the palace of ice!\r\n\r\nLike all his subjects, King Gelidus looked out through the round window\r\nof his fur hood, just as a big good-natured boy does through his\r\nskating-cap.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BATTLE FOR LIFE WITH THE WHITE CRABS.]\r\n\r\nThe Koltykwerps were not much taller than I, but were very stocky built,\r\nso that when broadened out by their thick fur suits they really took on\r\nat times the appearance of animated snowballs. It would be hard for the\r\nfingers of the deftest hand to draw faces fuller of kindliness and good\r\nnature than those of the Koltykwerps. Their small, honest gray eyes\r\nsparkled with a boniform glint, and so broad were their smiles that they\r\nwere only about half visible through the round holes of their fur hoods.\r\nI was delighted with them from the very start, and the more so when I\r\nheard King Gelidus cry out in a cheery voice: “A right crisp and cold\r\nwelcome to our icy court, little baron; but from what our people tell\r\nus, thou carriest a pair of hands so hot that we beg thee to take a few\r\ndays to cool off before thou touchest palms with any of the Koltykwerps,\r\nand we also beg thee to be careful and not to lean against any of our\r\nrichly carved panels, or to slide down any of our highly polished\r\nrailings, or to handle the strands of our jewels, or sit down for any\r\nlength of time on the front steps of our palace. And we make the same\r\nrequest of thy four-footed companion, who is said to be of even a warmer\r\ndisposition than thou.”\r\n\r\nI bowed and kissed my hand to his frigid Majesty, and assured him that I\r\nshould make every effort to lower my temperature as speedily as\r\npossible, and, in the mean time, that I should be extremely careful not\r\nto come into contact with any of the artistic carving of his palace of\r\nice.\r\n\r\nAs I pronounced these words, the whole company began to clap their\r\nhands; and as they did so, a cold shiver ran down my back, for there was\r\na sound, methought, very much like the rattling of dry bones to that\r\napplause, but I took good care not to let King Gelidus notice my fright.\r\n\r\nHis frigid Majesty now presented me to his daughter Schneeboule, a\r\npretty little maid of about sixteen crystal winters, with cheeks round\r\nas apples, and as deeply dimpled as the furrows of a cross-bun. Her eyes\r\ntwinkled as she looked upon Bulger and me, and turning to her frigid\r\npapa, she asked for leave to touch the tip end of my thumb, which being\r\ndone, she gave a squeaky little scream and began to blow on her tiny\r\nfinger as if I had blistered it.\r\n\r\nKing Gelidus also presented me to several of his court favorites, all\r\nmen of the coldest blood in the nation. Their names were Jellikin,\r\nPhrostyphiz, Icikul, and Glacierbhoy. They were all dreadfully slow\r\nthinkers when you questioned them very closely upon any subject.\r\n\r\nIt didn’t take me very long to discover this. In fact, they requested me\r\nto be less warm in my manner, and not to ask them any posers, as they\r\ninvariably found that deep thought caused a rise in their temperature.\r\n\r\nThis was, to be honest about it, very annoying to me; for you know, dear\r\nfriends, what a loadstone my mind is, never asleep, always in a quiver\r\nlike a mariner’s compass, pointing this way and that, in search of the\r\npolar star of wisdom.\r\n\r\nUpon making known my trouble to his frigid Majesty, King Gelidus, he\r\nmost gracefully ordered one of his trusty attendants to conduct me to\r\nthe triple walled ice-cell of a certain Koltykwerp by the name of\r\nBullibrain, that is, literally, “Boiling Brain,” a man who had been born\r\nwith a hot head, and consequently with a very active brain. For fifty\r\nyears King Gelidus had been doing his very best to refrigerate this\r\nsubject of his, but without success. As I was just bursting with\r\nimpatience to ask a whole string of questions concerning the\r\nKoltykwerps, you may imagine how delighted I was to make the\r\nacquaintance of Bullibrain, or Lord Hot Head as he was called among the\r\nKoltykwerps; but, dear friends, you must excuse me if I make this the\r\nend of a chapter and stop here for a brief rest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\n  LORD HOT HEAD AGAIN, AND, THIS TIME A FULLER ACCOUNT OF HIM.—HIS\r\n    WONDROUS TALES CONCERNING THE KOLTYKWERPS: WHERE THEY CAME FROM,\r\n    WHO THEY WERE, AND HOW THEY MANAGED TO LIVE IN THIS WORLD OF\r\n    ETERNAL FROST.—THE MANY QUESTIONS I PUT TO HIM, AND HIS ANSWERS IN\r\n    FULL.\r\n\r\n\r\nLord Bullibrain was never allowed to set foot inside the palace of ice.\r\nKing Gelidus, backed by the opinion of his favorites, still indulged the\r\nbelief that he would be able in the end to refrigerate him. True, he had\r\nbeen many years at the task, so that it had now become a sort of hobby\r\nof his, and almost daily did his frigid Majesty pay a visit to his\r\nhot-headed subject and test his temperature by pressing a small ball of\r\nice against his temples. To King Gelidus’ mind, a man of so high a\r\ntemperature was a continual menace to the peace and quiet of his\r\nkingdom. What if Lord Hot Head in a dream should wander forth some night\r\nand fall asleep with his back against one of the walls of the ice\r\npalace? Might he not melt away enough of it to throw the whole glorious\r\nfabric into a slump and slush of débris? It was terrible to think of,\r\nwhen he did think of it, and he thought of it quite often.\r\n\r\nBut Bullibrain had no terrors for me, nor for Bulger either; in fact,\r\nBulger was delighted to be stroked by a warm hand, and he and Bullibrain\r\nand I soon became the very best of friends; but his frigid Majesty was\r\nso alarmed when he heard of this friendship, that he was seized with\r\nquite a spasm of warmth, for, thought he, the united heat of three hot\r\nheads might work some terrible harm to the welfare of his people. So he\r\nissued the coldest kind of a decree carved on a tablet of ice, that\r\nBullibrain and I should on no one day pass more than a half-hour\r\ntogether; that we should never touch palm to palm, sleep in the same\r\nroom, eat from the same dish, or sit on the same divan.\r\n\r\nThese regulations were annoying, but I followed them to the letter; and\r\nwhen King Gelidus saw how careful I was to yield the strictest obedience\r\nto his decree, he conceived a genuine affection for me and sent several\r\nmagnificent pelts to the ice-house, which had been assigned to Bulger\r\nand me, for, of course, it would not have been safe for us to lodge in\r\nthe palace itself, but his frigid Majesty held out the flattering\r\nprospect that the very moment Bulger and I should become properly\r\nrefrigerated, apartments in the palace would be assigned to us, and, in\r\nfact, that I should be permitted to eat at the royal table.\r\n\r\nWho are the Koltykwerps? Where did these strange folk come from? How did\r\nthey ever find their way down into this World of Eternal Frost? And,\r\nabove all, where do they get their food and clothing from? These were a\r\nfew of the questions which I was so impatient to have answered that my\r\ntemperature was raised a whole degree, and I was obliged to sleep with\r\nonly one single pelt between me and my divan of crystal ice.\r\n\r\nFor a man bred and born in so cold a country as the land of the\r\nKoltykwerps, Bullibrain had an extremely quick and active mind. On\r\naccount of his rapid heart-beat, and the consequent high temperature of\r\nhis body, he was not able to do his writing on slabs of ice as other\r\nlearned Koltykwerps had done, for it would not have been a pleasant\r\nthing for him to see a poem which he had just finished literally melt\r\naway in his hands, without so much as leaving an ink-stain behind, so he\r\nhad been obliged, with King Gelidus’ permission, to do his writing on\r\nthin tablets of alabaster.\r\n\r\nBefore he began to talk to me about the progenitors of the Koltykwerps,\r\nhe showed me a map of the country in the upper world once inhabited by\r\nthem, and traced for me the course they had sailed upon abandoning that\r\ncountry, and described the beautiful shores they had landed upon in\r\ntheir search for a new home. I saw at a glance that it was Greenland\r\nwhich Bullibrain was thus unconsciously describing; and knowing as I did\r\nthat in past ages Greenland had been a land of blue skies, warm winds,\r\ngreen meadows, and fertile valleys, before moving mountains of ice came\r\ndown from the North and crushed all life out of it, I listened with\r\nbreathless interest to his wonderful tales of its beautiful lakes,\r\nnestled at the foot of vine-clad mountains, all of which Bullibrain now\r\nlooked upon in fair visions inherited from his ancestors. And I also\r\nknew that it must have been the Arctic Ocean which had been traversed by\r\nthe ships of the Koltykwerps, who had then landed upon the, in those\r\ndays, sunny shores of Northern Russia.\r\n\r\nBut the mountains of ice could sail too, and they followed the fleeing\r\nKoltykwerps like mighty monsters, dashing themselves with terrible roar\r\nand crash upon the peaceful shores, which they soon transformed into a\r\nwilderness of berg, of glacier, and of floe.\r\n\r\nOnly a handful of the Koltykwerps survived; and these, in their dumb\r\ndespair taking refuge in the clefts and caverns of the North Urals,\r\ncould from their hiding-places look upon one of the strangest sights\r\nthat had ever greeted human eyes. So rapid had been the advance of these\r\nmighty masses of ice, crashing against the mountain sides and rending\r\nthe very rocks in their fury, that the air gave up its warmth, and the\r\nsun was powerless to give it back again. The animals of the wild wood\r\nand the beasts of the field, overtaken in their flight, perished as they\r\nran and stood there stark and stiff, with heads uptossed and muscles\r\nknotted. Them by the thousands and ten times thousands the crushed\r\ncrystals of the pursuing floods caught up like moss and leaves in a\r\nmountain torrent and packed in every cave and cavern on the way, tearing\r\nbroader and loftier portals into these subterranean chambers, so that\r\nthey might do their work the better!\r\n\r\n“And these, then, O Bullibrain, are your meat quarries,” I exclaimed,\r\n“whence ye draw your daily food?”\r\n\r\n“Even so, little baron,” replied the hot-headed Koltykwerp, “and not\r\nonly our food, but the skins which serve us so admirably for clothing in\r\nthis cold, under ground world, and the oil, too, which burns in our\r\nbeautiful alabaster lamps, besides a hundred other things, such as bone\r\nfor helves and handles, horn for needles and buttons and eating\r\nutensils, wool for the weaving of our under-garments, and magnificent\r\npelts of bear and seal and walrus, which, laid upon our benches and\r\ndivans of crystal ice, transform them into beds and couches which even\r\nan inhabitant of thy world might envy.”\r\n\r\n“But, O Bullibrain,” I cried out, “have ye not almost exhausted these\r\nsupplies? Will not death from starvation soon stare ye all in the face\r\nin these deep and icy caverns of the under world, visited by the sun’s\r\nlight yet unwarmed by it?”\r\n\r\n“Nay, little baron,” answered Bullibrain with a smile almost as warm as\r\none of my own; “let not that thought give thee a moment’s alarm, for we\r\nhave as yet barely raised the lid of this ice-box of nature’s packing.\r\nWe are not large eaters any way,” continued Lord Hot Head, “for while it\r\nis true that we are not indolent people, for his frigid Majesty’s palace\r\nand our dwellings need constant repair, and new hatchets and axes must\r\nbe chipped out in the flint quarries and new lamps carved and new\r\ngarments woven, yet it is also true that we take life rather easy. We\r\nhave no enemies to slay, no quarrels to settle, no gold to fight over,\r\nno land to drive our fellow-creatures from and fence in; nor can we be\r\nill, if we were willing to be, for in this pure, cold, crisp air disease\r\nwould try in vain to sow her poison germs; hence, needing no doctors, we\r\nhave none, as we have no lawyers either, or merchants to sell us what\r\nbelongs to us already. His frigid Majesty is an excellent king. I never\r\nread of a better one. I doubt that his like exists in the upper world.\r\nAlways cool headed, no thought of conquest, no dreams of power, no\r\nlongings for empty pomp and show ever enter his mind. Since the day his\r\nfather died and we set the great Koltykwerp crown of crystal ice upon\r\nhis cool brow, his temperature has never risen but a half a degree, and\r\nthat was only for a brief hour or so, and was occasioned by a mad\r\nproposal of one of his councillors, who claimed that he had discovered\r\nan explosive compound, something like the gunpowder of thy world, I\r\nfancy, by which he could shatter the glorious window of rock crystal set\r\nin the mountain dome of our under world and let in the warm sunshine.”\r\n\r\n“Did his frigid Majesty Gelidus put this daring Koltykwerp to death?” I\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n“Oh, dear, no,” replied Bullibrain; “he merely ordered him to be\r\nrefrigerated for so many hours a day until all his feverish projects had\r\nbeen chilled to death; for no doubt, little baron, a man of thy deep\r\nlearning knows full well that all the ills which thy world suffers from\r\nare the children of fevered brains, of minds made restless and visionary\r\nby the high temperature of the blood which gallops through the\r\napproaches to the dome of thought, stirring up wild dreams and visions\r\nas thy sun lifts the poisonous vapor from the stagnant pool.”\r\n\r\nThe more I listened to Bullibrain the more I liked him. The fact of the\r\nmatter is, I preferred to sit in his narrow cell with its plain walls of\r\nice lighted up by a single alabaster lamp and converse with him to\r\nloitering in the splendid throne-room of his frigid Majesty King\r\nGelidus; but Bulger had discovered that the pelts of Princess\r\nSchneeboule’s divan were much thicker, softer, and warmer than the\r\nsingle one allowed Lord Hot Head, and therefore he preferred spending\r\nhis time with her; but fearing lest he might get into mischief, I didn’t\r\ndare to leave him alone with the princess too long at a time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\n  SOME FEW THINGS CONCERNING THE DEAR LITTLE PRINCESS SCHNEEBOULE.—HOW\r\n    SHE AND I BECAME FAST FRIENDS, AND HOW ONE DAY SHE CONDUCTED\r\n    BULGER AND ME INTO HER FAVORITE GROTTO TO SEE THE LITTLE MAN WITH\r\n    THE FROZEN SMILE.—SOMETHING ABOUT HIM.—WHAT CAME OF MY HAVING\r\n    LOOKED UPON HIM QUITE FULLY DESCRIBED.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the time of Bulger’s and my arrival in the land of the Koltykwerps\r\nthe Princess Schneeboule was about fifteen years of age, and I must say\r\nthat rarely had it been my good fortune to make the acquaintance of such\r\na sweet-tempered, lovable little creature. She flitted about the ice\r\npalace like a beam of sunlight, and there was nothing of the spoiled\r\nchild about her, although a bit mischievous at times.\r\n\r\nHer voice was as full of music as a skylark’s, and it was not many days\r\nbefore she and I had become the best friends in the world.\r\n\r\nNow, you must know, dear friends, that according to the law of the\r\nKoltykwerps, a princess is left absolutely free to choose her own\r\nhusband, and his frigid Majesty was very anxious that Schneeboule should\r\npick hers out as soon as possible. Moreover, the law of the land gave\r\nher perfect freedom to choose a husband of high or low degree, provided\r\nhe was young enough. The way in which a Koltykwerp princess was required\r\nto make known her preference was to press a kiss upon the cheek of the\r\nyoung man whom she might settle upon. This ennobled him at once, and he\r\nbecame the heir apparent to the throne of ice, and entitled to sit on\r\nits steps until he should be crowned king.\r\n\r\nNow, his frigid Majesty was delighted to see this friendship spring up\r\nbetween Schneeboule and me, for he hoped to make use of my influence to\r\nbring her to set the necessary kiss on some youth’s cheek before I took\r\nmy departure from the cold Kingdom of the Koltykwerps. I gave him the\r\nword of a nobleman that I would do my best to carry out his wishes.\r\n\r\nWith Schneeboule for a guide, Bulger and I often went for walks through\r\nthe splendid ice grottos of her father’s kingdom, selecting days when\r\nthe sunlight of the outer world poured strongest through the mighty lens\r\nset in the side of the mountain. Then these grottos took on a splendor\r\nthat my poor tongue is powerless to describe. Their crystal mazes\r\nglittered as if their walls were set with massive jewels most\r\nwonderfully cut and polished, and as if their ceilings were fretted with\r\ngems so peerless that all the gold of the upper world would fall far\r\nshort of paying for them. Here, there, and everywhere the skill of the\r\nKoltykwerps had carved and chiselled graceful flights of steps, broad\r\nlandings with majestic columns, and winding corridors lined with long\r\nrows of statues, single and group-wise; and ever and anon the visitor\r\ncame upon a terrace where, seated upon a fur-covered divan, he might\r\nlook out upon the bewildering beauty of King Gelidus’ icy domains, arch\r\ntouching arch and dome springing from dome, while over and above all,\r\nthrough the gigantic lens in its granite setting, a mile above our\r\nheads, streamed a flood of glorious sunlight, lighting up this World\r\nwithin a World with a radiance so grand and so complete as to seem to be\r\na sun of a far greater splendor than the one that warmed the upper world\r\nand bathed it in so many gorgeous hues at morn and eve. Hardly a day\r\nwent by now that the princess of the Koltykwerps did not surprise either\r\nBulger or me with some gift or other.\r\n\r\nTo tell the truth, dear friends, although my Russian coat was\r\nfur-trimmed, yet I began to feel the need of warmer garments after a\r\nweek’s sojourn in the icy domain of King Gelidus, and I think\r\nSchneeboule must have heard my teeth chattering, for one morning, upon\r\nentering the Palace of Ice, I was delighted to be presented with a full\r\nsuit of fur precisely similar to the one worn by King Gelidus himself.\r\n\r\nNor was Bulger forgotten by the loving little Princess, for with her own\r\nhands she had knitted him a blanket of the softest wool, which she\r\nbelted so snugly around his body and tied so tightly around his neck\r\nthat henceforth he felt perfectly comfortable in the chill air of the\r\nhome of the Koltykwerps.\r\n\r\nOne day the Princess Schneeboule said to me,—\r\n\r\n“Oh, come, little baron, come to my favorite grotto, now that the sun’s\r\nrays are bright within it; there shalt thou see a wonder.”\r\n\r\n“A wonder, Princess Schneeboule?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, little baron, a wonder,” she repeated: “the Little Man with the\r\nFrozen Smile.”\r\n\r\n“Little Man with the Frozen Smile?” I echoed.\r\n\r\n“Come and see, come and see, little baron!” cried Schneeboule, hurrying\r\non ahead.\r\n\r\nIn a few moments we had reached the grotto and bounded into it with the\r\nPrincess leading the way.\r\n\r\nSuddenly she halted in front of a magnificent block of crystal ice,\r\nclear as polished glass, and cried out,—\r\n\r\n“There, look! There is the Little Man with the Frozen Smile!”\r\n\r\nEven now, as the thought of that moment comes over me, I feel something\r\nof the thrill of half fear, half joy, as my eyes fell upon the little\r\ncreature shut in that superb block of ice, himself a part of it, himself\r\nits heart, its contents, its mystery. There, in its centre, in easy\r\nposture, with wide opened eyes, and with what might be called a smile\r\nupon its face—that is a glint of kindliness and affection in its strange\r\neyes with their overhanging brows, sat a small animal of the chimpanzee\r\nrace. He had possibly been asleep when the icy flood struck him,\r\ndreaming of beautiful trees bending beneath purple fruit, of cloudless\r\nskies above and a coral beach below, and death had come to him so\r\nquickly that he had become a brother to this block of ice while the\r\nhappy dream was still in his thoughts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE LITTLE MAN WITH THE FROZEN SMILE.]\r\n\r\nIt was wonderful, it was more than wonderful! Spellbound by the strange\r\nspectacle, I stood there, I know not how long, with my eyes looking into\r\nhis. At last Schneeboule’s voice aroused me:\r\n\r\n“Ha! ha!” she laughed; “look, little baron, Bulger is trying to kiss his\r\npoor dead brother.”\r\n\r\nIn truth, Bulger did have his nose pressed firmly against the block of\r\nice in his effort to scent the strange animal imprisoned in that crystal\r\ncell—so near, and yet so far beyond the reach of his keen scent.\r\n\r\n“Well, little baron,” cried Schneeboule, “did I not speak truly? Have I\r\nnot shown thee the Little Man with the Frozen Smile?”\r\n\r\n“Indeed thou hast, fair princess,” was my reply; “and I cannot tell thee\r\nhow grateful I am to thee for having done so.”\r\n\r\nThen, as she plucked me by the sleeve, I pleaded, “Nay, gentle\r\nSchneeboule, not yet, not yet, let me bide a bit longer. The Little Man\r\nwith the Frozen Smile seems to beg me not to go. I can almost imagine\r\nthat I hear him whisper: ‘O little baron, break open the crystal cell of\r\nmy prison and take me with thee back to the world of sunshine, back to\r\nthe land of the orange-tree, where the soft warm winds used to rock me\r\nto sleep in the cradle of the swaying boughs, while the wise and\r\nwatchful patriarch of our flock stood guard over us all.’”\r\n\r\nSchneeboule’s big, round, gray eyes filled with tears at these words.\r\n\r\n“Would that he were alive, little baron,” she murmured, “and that I\r\ncould give him some of my happiness to pay him back for all the long\r\nyears he has been spending in his icy prison.”\r\n\r\nIn a few moments Schneeboule took me by the hand and led me away from\r\nthe great block of ice with its silent prisoner. My heart was very\r\nheavy, and both Schneeboule and Bulger did their utmost to divert me,\r\nbut all to no purpose.\r\n\r\nLeaving the princess at the portal of the palace, I went to my dwelling\r\nwhich was ablaze with the soft glow of its alabaster lamps, and there I\r\nfound a beautiful new pelt spread over my divan, a new gift from King\r\nGelidus. But I could take no pleasure in it. My thoughts were all with\r\nthe Little Man with the Frozen Smile locked in the icy embrace of that\r\ncrystal mould, which, in its cold irony, let him seem to be so free and\r\nunfettered and yet held him in such vise-like grip. After a while I\r\ndismissed my serving people and laid me down for the night with my dear\r\nBulger nestled against my breast. But I could not sleep. All night long\r\nthose strange eyes with their uncanny glint followed me about, pleading\r\nstrong but silent for me to come again, for me to soften my heart like a\r\nchild of the sunshine that I was, to shatter his crystal dungeon, and\r\nset him loose, to bear him away from the icy domain of the Koltykwerps\r\nout into the warm air of the upper world. What was I dreaming about? Was\r\nhe not dead? Had not his spirit left his body thousands and thousands of\r\nyears ago? Why should I let such wild thoughts vex my mind? What good\r\nwould come of it? None, none whatever. I was a reasonable creature, I\r\nmust not give lodgment within my brain to such silly ideas.\r\n\r\nThe Little Man with the Frozen Smile had been, through almost playful\r\nfate, laid away in a beautiful tomb. I must not disturb it. No doubt in\r\nhis lifetime he had been the pet of a noble manor, brought to the\r\nNorthland from some sunny clime by master of powerful argosy. Let him\r\nrest in peace. I must not dare to mar the beauty of his crystal tomb, so\r\ngloriously transparent!\r\n\r\nI was even sorry that Schneeboule had led me into her beautiful grotto,\r\nand resolved to go thither no more.\r\n\r\nWhat poor weak creatures are we, so fertile in good resolutions and yet\r\nso unfruitful of results, planting whole acres with fair promises, but\r\nwhen the tender shoots pierce the ground turning our back upon the crop\r\nas if it didn’t belong to us!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\n  A SLEEPLESS NIGHT FOR BULGER AND ME AND WHAT FOLLOWED IT.—INTERVIEW\r\n    WITH KING GELIDUS.—MY REQUEST AND HIS REPLY.—WHAT ALL TOOK PLACE\r\n    WHEN I LEARNED THAT THE KING AND HIS COUNCILLORS HAD DECIDED NOT\r\n    TO GRANT MY REQUEST.—STRANGE TUMULT AMONG THE KOLTYKWERPS, AND HOW\r\n    HIS FRIGID MAJESTY STILLED IT, AND SOME OTHER THINGS.\r\n\r\n\r\nNot only had I been unable to sleep, but by my tossing about I had kept\r\npoor dear Bulger awake so that when morning came we both looked haggard\r\nenough. I felt as if I had been through a fit of sickness, and no doubt\r\nhe did too. At any rate I had no appetite for the heavy meat diet of the\r\nKoltykwerps, and seeing me refuse my breakfast, Bulger did likewise.\r\n\r\nI had promised Schneeboule to come early to the palace, for she had a\r\nnumber of questions which she wished to ask me concerning the upper\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n“Good-morning, little baron,” she cried in her sweetest tones as I\r\nentered the throne-room. “Didst sleep well last night on the new pelt\r\nwhich papa sent thee?” I was about to make a reply when Schneeboule’s\r\nhand coming in contact with mine,—for we had both removed our gloves in\r\norder to shake hands,—she uttered a piercing scream, and drawing back\r\nstood there blowing her breath on her right palm as she exclaimed, again\r\nand again,—\r\n\r\n“Firebrand! Firebrand!”\r\n\r\nIn an instant King Gelidus and a group of his councillors drew near,\r\nand, pulling over their gloves, one after the other laid his hand in\r\nmine.\r\n\r\n“Glowing coals!” cried his frigid Majesty.\r\n\r\n“Tongue of flame!” roared Phrostyphiz.\r\n\r\n“Boiling water!” groaned Glacierbhoy.\r\n\r\n“Red hot!” hissed Icikul.\r\n\r\n“Thou must leave the palace at once,” half pleaded King Gelidus. “It\r\nwould simply he madness for me to permit such a firebrand to remain\r\nwithin the walls of the royal residence. The intense heat of thy body\r\nwould be sure to melt a hole in its walls ere the sun goes down.”\r\n\r\nThe royal councillors again drew off their gloves and laid hands upon\r\npoor Bulger, when a second alarm, even wilder than the first, was sent\r\nup and we were hastily escorted back to our lodging-house.\r\n\r\nNo doubt, dear friends, you will be somewhat mystified upon reading\r\nthese words, but the explanation is easy: Owing to worriment and lack of\r\nsleep, Bulger and I had awaked in a highly feverish condition, and to\r\nthe Koltykwerps we had really seemed to be almost on fire, but our fever\r\nleft us toward night; hearing which, King Gelidus sent for us and did\r\nall in his power to entertain us with song and dance, in both of which,\r\nSchneeboule was very skilled. Finding that his frigid Majesty was in\r\nsuch a rosy humor, if I may be allowed to speak that way of a person\r\nwhose face was almost as white as the alabaster lamps over his head, I\r\ndetermined to ask him for permission to cleave asunder the icy cell of\r\nthe Little Man with the Frozen Smile, and ascertain if possible from the\r\ncollar, which, made up apparently of gold and silver coin was clasped\r\naround his neck, to whom he had belonged and where his home had been.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had I proferred my request, than I noticed that the white face\r\nof the royal Gelidus parted with its smile and took on a terribly icy\r\nlook.\r\n\r\nMethought I could look through the tip of his nose as though an icicle,\r\nand methought, too, that his ears shone in the light of the alabaster\r\nlamps like sheets of crystal ice, and that his voice as he spoke puffed\r\ninto my face like the first flakes of a coming snowstorm.\r\n\r\nI quickly repented me of my rash action. But it was too late and I\r\ndetermined to stand by it.\r\n\r\n“Little baron,” spoke royal Gelidus in icy tones, “never a heart beat in\r\na kingly breast that was purer and colder than mine, freer from the\r\nwarmth of selfishness, with not a single hot corner for ire or anger to\r\nnestle in, or for weakness or folly to make their hiding-places. For\r\nthousands of years my people have inhabited this icy domain and breathed\r\nthis pure cold air, and never yet hath one desired to strike an axe of\r\nflint into the walls of that crystal prison. However, little baron,\r\nthere may be some warm corner in my heart wherein cold and limpid wisdom\r\nmay not be at home. Therefore, come to me to-morrow for my answer,\r\nmeanwhile I’ll take council with the coolest brains and coldest hearts\r\nabout me. If they see no harm in thy request, thou mayst crack open the\r\ncrystal gates that have for so many centuries shut the manlike creature\r\nin his silent cell, and take him forth in order to study the mystic\r\nwords graven on his collar; but upon the strict condition that in\r\ncleaving open his house of crystal my quarry men so apply their wedges\r\nof flint as to break the block into two equal pieces, that when thou\r\nhast read what may be there, the two parts be closed upon the little man\r\nagain, edge fitting edge, like a perfect mould, so exactly that to the\r\neye no sign of line or joint be visible. Dost promise, little baron,\r\nthat this shall be as to our royal will, it seems meet that it should\r\nbe?”\r\n\r\nI promised most solemnly that the crystal cell of the Little Man with\r\nthe Frozen Smile should be opened and closed exactly as his frigid\r\nMajesty had directed.\r\n\r\nIt would be hard for me to tell you, dear friends, how happy I went to\r\nrest that night upon my icy divan, and how as the tiny flame of my\r\nalabaster lamp shed its soft glow upon the walls of ice, I lay there\r\nturning over in my mind the strange and mysterious pleasure which was\r\nsoon to fall to my lot when the quarry men of King Gelidus should set\r\ntheir wedges of flint in this glorious block of ice and cleave it\r\nasunder.\r\n\r\nEven Don Fum, Master of Masters, had never dreamed of receiving a\r\nmessage from the people who lived in the very childhood of the world,\r\nand in anticipation already I enjoyed the splendid triumph which would\r\nbe mine when I came to lecture before learned societies upon the\r\nmysterious lettering on the curious collar clasping the neck of the\r\nLittle Man with the Frozen Smile.\r\n\r\nImagine my anguish then, dear friends, upon receiving a message from\r\nKing Gelidus the next day that his councillors had with one voice\r\ndecreed against the opening of the crystal prison which stood in\r\nSchneeboule’s grotto!\r\n\r\nI was as if smitten with some sudden and awful ailment. I had never felt\r\nuntil that moment how keen the tooth of disappointment could be. I\r\nshivered first with a chill that made me brother to the Koltykwerps, and\r\nthen I burned with a fever so raging that a wild rumor spread through\r\nGelidus’ icy domain that I was setting fire to the very walls and roof.\r\nWith wild outcries, and faces drawn with nameless dread, the subjects of\r\nhis frigid Majesty rushed pell mell up the wide flights of stairs\r\nleading to the palace of ice, and pleaded for the king to show himself.\r\n\r\nIn cold and frigid majesty, Gelidus walked out upon the platform and\r\nlistened to the prayers of his people.\r\n\r\n“We shall burn,” they cried; “our beautiful homes will fall about our\r\nears. These crystal steps will melt away, and all these fair columns and\r\narches and statues and pedestals will turn to water and empty themselves\r\ninto the lower caverns of the earth. The great window of our sky will\r\nfall with awful crash upon our heads, putting an end forever to this\r\nfair domain of crystal splendor. O Gelidus, haste thee, haste thee, ere\r\nit be too late, let the little baron have his way before bitter\r\ndisappointment transforms his body and limbs into tongues of flame to\r\nlick up this magnificent palace in a single night, and dash its thousand\r\nalabaster lamps to the ground, a heap of sheards, no fragment matching\r\nits brother fragment, but all a wretched mass of worthless matter!”\r\n\r\nKing Gelidus and his frosty councillors saw that it would be useless to\r\nattempt to reason with the people, and therefore turning toward them, he\r\ncoldly waved his chilly right hand, and with an icy smile spoke frostily\r\nas follows,—\r\n\r\n“Go, Koltykwerps to your homes, and be happy. What think you, have I a\r\nheated brain, doth my heart steam with foolishness, that you should\r\nthink me capable of wishing harm to the tiniest Koltykwerp that spins\r\nhis top of ice in my fair kingdom? Go to your homes, I say; the little\r\nbaron is already cooling off, for he hath my full consent to cleave\r\nasunder the crystal prison of the Little Man with the Frozen Smile.\r\nThere is nothing be frightened about, my children. So eat hearty suppers\r\nand sleep soundly to-night, for my royal word for it, by to-morrow\r\nmorning the little baron will cease to be the least bit dangerous to the\r\npeace and welfare of our icy kingdom. A cold good-night to you all.”\r\n\r\nIn a short half hour the panic-stricken Koltykwerps were all back in\r\ntheir homes again, and when a messenger came from King Gelidus to\r\nmeasure my temperature he found such a great improvement that he opened\r\nhis chilly heart and sent me a beautiful present from his treasure\r\nhouse, to wit: A small block of ice, clearer than any gem I had ever\r\nseen, in the heart of which lay a glorious red rose in fullest bloom,\r\neach velvet petal opened out eagerly. Upon consulting my diary I found\r\nthat it was just six months to a day since I had left Castle Trump and\r\nthe loved ones sheltered by its time-worn tiles, and cold as was the\r\ncovering of this thrice beautiful child of the upper world I clasped it\r\nto my breast and shed tears.\r\n\r\nAnd this was the way it came about, dear friends, that King Gelidus and\r\nhis frosty councillors were brought to give their consent to my cleaving\r\nasunder the icy prison wherein lay the Little Man with the Frozen Smile.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\n  HOW THE QUARRY MEN OF KING GELIDUS CLEFT ASUNDER THE CRYSTAL PRISON\r\n    OF THE LITTLE MAN WITH THE FROZEN SMILE.—MY BITTER DISAPPOINTMENT,\r\n    AND HOW I BORE IT.—WONDERFUL HAPPENINGS OF THE NIGHT THAT\r\n    FOLLOWED.—BULGER AGAIN PROVES HIMSELF TO BE AN ANIMAL OF\r\n    EXTRAORDINARY SAGACITY.\r\n\r\n\r\nBulger and I had little appetite for the dainty breakfast of stewed\r\nsweetbreads which the Koltykwerps set before us the next morning, for I\r\nknew, and he half suspected, that something important was going to\r\nhappen, being nothing less than the cleaving asunder of the crystal cell\r\nwhich had held the little chimpanzee a prisoner for so many centuries.\r\n\r\nWalking beside the merry Princess Schneeboule, who was delighted to know\r\nthat his frigid Majesty, her father, had at last yielded to my wishes,\r\nBulger and I set out for the beautiful ice grotto; behind us walked\r\nPhrostyphiz and Glacierbhoy with instructions from the king to supervise\r\nthe cleaving asunder of the block of ice; and after them came four of\r\nKing Gelidus’ quarry men, two bearing flint axes with helves of polished\r\nbone, and two carrying the flint wedges to be used in the work.\r\n\r\nWe soon entered Schneeboule’s grotto, and the task was at once entered\r\nupon.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to me I could almost see the Little Man with the Frozen Smile\r\nwink his eyelids as the quarry men set their wedges in place and began\r\nto mark the line of fracture; but, of course, dear friends, you know\r\nwhat an imagination I have, especially when I get worked up over\r\nanything. So you must take what I say sometimes with a grain of salt,\r\nalthough as a rule, you may accept my statements with child-like\r\nconfidence.\r\n\r\nWith such wonderful skill did the Koltykwerpian quarry men use their\r\naxes and wedges that in a few moments, to my great delight, the huge\r\nblock of ice fell asunder in perfect halves, in one of which the little\r\nmanlike creature lay on his side like a casting in a mould.\r\n\r\nI made haste to lift him out and wrap him a soft pelt, which I had\r\nbrought along for that purpose, and then I turned to retrace my steps to\r\nmy chamber, where I intended to begin at once my study of whatever\r\ninscriptions should be found upon his curious collar.\r\n\r\n“Remember little baron,” said Glacierbhoy, “by express command of his\r\nfrigid Majesty, the Little Man with the Frozen Smile must be returned to\r\nhis crystal cell to-morrow morning at this very hour.”\r\n\r\nI bowed assent, and then, having accompanied Princess Schneeboule as far\r\nas the bottom of the grand staircase leading to the ice palace, I turned\r\naway and was soon in the privacy of my own apartment.\r\n\r\nNow came for me one of the bitterest disappointments of my life; but I\r\nsubmitted with a good grace, for it was fit punishment visited upon me\r\nfor my foolish vanity in striving to unearth some older record of the\r\nhuman race than had yet been done by any of the great searchers and\r\nphilosophers, not even excepting that Master of Masters, Don\r\nStrephalofidgeguaneriusfum!\r\n\r\nKnow then, dear friends, that the quaint collar, made up of gold and\r\nsilver coins, or disks, cunningly linked together, which encircled the\r\nanimal’s neck, contained not a single word or letter of any language,\r\nthe undersides being quite blank, and the upper merely having roughly\r\ncarved outlines of an object which might possibly have been intended for\r\nthe sun.\r\n\r\nWrapping the animal up in the soft pelt, I laid him away in a corner of\r\nmy divan and betook myself to the palace of his frigid Majesty, where I\r\nfrankly informed King Gelidus of my great disappointment in not finding\r\nsome few words or even a single word of a language unknown to the wisest\r\nheads of the upper world.\r\n\r\nSchneeboule was so touched by my sadness that, had I not skilfully kept\r\nout of her way, I verily believe she would have thrown her arms around\r\nmy neck and imprinted upon my cheek the kiss which would have made me\r\nthe king of the Koltykwerps; but I had no longing to spend the rest of\r\nmy life in the icy domains of his frigid Majesty, even though my brow\r\nwould be crowned with the cold crown of the Koltykwerps. If I had been\r\nan old man, with slow and feeble pulse, it would have been very\r\ndifferent; but my heart was too warm and my blood too hot to fill such a\r\nposition with agreeableness to myself or satisfaction to the people of\r\nthis icy under world. So I kept the little princess busy enough, I can\r\nassure you, first with songs, then with dance, and then with\r\nstory-telling.\r\n\r\nThat night King Gelidus ordered a magnificent fête to be held in my\r\nhonor. Five hundred more alabaster lamps were lighted, and the royal\r\ndivans were laid with the richest pelts in the palace, and after the\r\ndancing and singing had ended, frozen tidbits from the royal kitchen\r\nwere passed around on alabaster salvers, and Bulger and I ate until our\r\nteeth ached.\r\n\r\nIt was late when we reached our own apartment, and so full were my\r\nthoughts of the beautiful sights which we had gazed upon in the\r\nthrone-room, that I had quite forgotten about the poor Little Man with\r\nthe Frozen Smile whom I had covered up and tucked away on my divan; but\r\nBulger had not been so hard-hearted.\r\n\r\nTwenty times during the evening he had given me a sly tug at my sleeve\r\nas much as to say,—\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BULGER SHOWS THE BARON SOMETHING WONDERFUL.]\r\n\r\n“Come, little master, let’s hurry back; dost not remember that we left\r\nmy poor little frozen brother tucked away in that icy chamber all alone\r\nby himself?” I was very weary and I fell off to sleep almost\r\nimmediately, and yet I had an indistinct recollection that Bulger was\r\nnot in his place against my breast. I remembered feeling for him, but\r\nthat’s all. It never flashed upon me that he had gone and lain down\r\nbeside the poor little stranger, whom I had so unfeelingly lifted from\r\nhis last resting-place, and yet such must have been the case, for about\r\nmidnight, it seemed to me, I was awakened by a gentle tugging at my\r\nsleeve.\r\n\r\nIt was my faithful Bulger, but, half awake and half asleep as I was, I\r\nmerely thought that he was only asking for a caress, as was often his\r\nwont when he fell a-thinking about home, so I reached out and stroked\r\nhis head several times and dropped off again.\r\n\r\nBut the tugging began anew, and this time ’twas more vigorous and with\r\nit came an impatient whine which meant,—\r\n\r\n“Come, come, little master, rouse thee; dost suppose I would break thy\r\nrest unless there were good reasons for it?” I didn’t need a third\r\nreminder, but with a single bound landed on my feet, and reaching out\r\nfor one of the tiny tapers which the Koltykwerps make use of as\r\nlighters, I carried the flames from the single lamp burning on the wall\r\nto the three others hanging here and there.\r\n\r\nThe icy walls of my chamber were now ablaze with light. There sat Bulger\r\non the fur-covered divan, beside the place where the Little Man with the\r\nFrozen Smile lay hidden under the pelt. His tail was wagging nervously,\r\nand his large, lustrous eyes were fixed first upon me and then upon the\r\ncovering of his dead brother with an expression I never remembered\r\nhaving seen in them before, and then with a sudden movement he laid hold\r\nof the pelt and, drawing it aside, showed me, what think you, dear\r\nfriends, what, I ask in a tone half whisper, half gasp, for now years\r\nafter I still can feel that wonderful thrill which I felt then? Why, it\r\nwas alive! That ape-like creature had come to life after his sleep of\r\nthousands of years in that narrow, crystal cell! Bulger had lain down\r\nbeside his frozen brother and warmed him back to life again!\r\n\r\nOh, it was wondrously wonderful to see that pair of little eyes,\r\nbeadlike in brightness, look up and blink at me; and then to hear that\r\nlow, moaning voice, so human-like, as if it whimpered, with a shake and\r\na shiver,—\r\n\r\n“Oh, how cold it is! how very cold it is! Where’s the sun? Where’s the\r\nsoft warm wind, and where are the cloudless skies so blue, oh so\r\nbeautifully blue, that used to hang over my head?”\r\n\r\nBidding Bulger lie down again beside him and snuggle up as close as\r\npossible, I made haste to cover them both with the softest skins I could\r\nfind.\r\n\r\nIn a few moments there came from underneath the pile a low, contented\r\ncry of “Coojah! Coojah! Coojah!” followed by a curious addition sounding\r\nlike “Fuff! Fuff! Fuff!” so I put them all together and named the\r\nstrange new comer to the icy domain of King Gelidus—Fuffcoojah!\r\n\r\nSleep any more that night? Not a wink. The same joy came over me that I\r\nused to feel on Christmas morning long ago when Kris Kringle brought me\r\nsome wonderful bit of mechanism moved by a secret spring—for I always\r\nscorned to accept ordinary toys like ordinary children; and oh, how I\r\nlonged for the morning, when it would be time for me to bundle up the\r\nLittle Man—no longer him with the Frozen Smile, but Fuffcoojah, the Live\r\nBoy from Faraway, with his curious little face screwed up into such a\r\nfunny look—and carry him to the palace.\r\n\r\nHow delighted Schneeboule will be! thought I, and King Gelidus too, how\r\nhe will unbend from his frigid majesty as he watches the antics of\r\nFuffcoojah, and how pleased all the dignified Koltykwerpians, including\r\neven Phrostyphiz and Glacierbhoy, will be when I tell them that the\r\nLittle Man with the Frozen Smile has come to life again!\r\n\r\nWhat crowds of Koltykwerps, men, women and children, will rush up the\r\nlong flights of steps leading to the Ice Palace, begging and entreating\r\nKing Gelidus to let them have just a little look at Fuffcoojah, the\r\nlittle man set free from his icy cell by the famous traveller, Baron\r\nSebastian von Troomp!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\n  EXCITEMENT OVER FUFFCOOJAH.—I CARRY HIM TO THE COURT OF KING\r\n    GELIDUS.—HIS INSTANT AFFECTION FOR PRINCESS SCHNEEBOULE.—I AM\r\n    ACCUSED OF EXERCISING THE BLACK ART.—MY DEFENCE AND MY\r\n    REWARD.—ANXIETY OF THE KOLTYKWERPS LEST FUFFCOOJAH PERISH OF\r\n    HUNGER.—THIS CALAMITY AVERTED, ANOTHER STARES US IN THE FACE: HOW\r\n    TO KEEP HIM FROM FREEZING TO DEATH.—I SOLVE THE PROBLEM, BUT DRAW\r\n    UPON ME A STRANGE MISFORTUNE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt all turned out just as I had thought it would! The moment it became\r\nknown that the Little Man with the Frozen Smile had actually come to\r\nlife, the wildest excitement prevailed in every part of the icy domain\r\nof his frigid Majesty. I was astounded at the change in the actions of\r\nthe Koltykwerps. They moved more quickly, they talked faster, they made\r\nmore gestures than I had ever seen them do before. In some cases, you\r\nwill hardly believe it, dear friends, I actually noticed a faint glow in\r\nthe cold cheeks of a few of them.\r\n\r\nI had hoped to be able to bundle Fuffcoojah up warmly and make my escape\r\nto the ice palace before the people learned of his coming to life, but\r\nin vain. When I made my appearance at the door, there was a large crowd\r\nof Koltykwerps pushing and pulling in front of my quarters.\r\n\r\nMost of them were good-natured, and cried out,—\r\n\r\n“Show him to us, little baron, show us the Little Man with the Frozen\r\nSmile whom thou hast brought to life. Let us look upon his face!”\r\n\r\n“Nay, nay, Koltykwerps!” I exclaimed, “it must not be! His frigid\r\nMajesty must be the first to look upon Fuffcoojah’s face. Room, room for\r\nthe noble guest of royal Gelidus! In the name of his frigid Majesty give\r\nway and let me pass!”\r\n\r\nThe Koltykwerps showed no inclination to obey. To such a pitch of\r\nexcitement had they worked themselves up that only upon seeing Bulger\r\nadvance upon them with flashing eye and teeth laid bare, did they reach\r\nthe conclusion that my brave companion was in no mood to be trifled\r\nwith.\r\n\r\nThwarted in their wild desire to get a peep at Fuffcoojah, the\r\nKoltykwerps now began to rail at me as I passed them by on my way to the\r\nice palace.\r\n\r\n“Oho, Master magician! Ha, ha, Prince of the Black Art! Boo, boo, little\r\nwizard! Have a care, wily necromancer, see to it that thou dost not\r\npractise any of thy tricks of enchantment upon us!” I was glad when the\r\naxe-bearer saw my plight and hurried forward to extricate me from the\r\ncrowd of angry people.\r\n\r\nKing Gelidus met me at the portal of his ice palace, and at his heels\r\ncame Princess Schneeboule, who could hardly wait for her turn to take a\r\nlook at the curious living creature which I unwrapped just enough to let\r\nher see its nose.\r\n\r\nThe instant Fuffcoojah set eyes upon the sweet face of the Koltykwerpian\r\nprincess, he stretched out his little arm as a child might to its\r\nmother. This sudden show of affection caused Schneeboule the liveliest\r\npleasure, and quickly drawing off one of her gloves she reached out and\r\nstroked the animal’s head, but at the touch of those, to him, icy little\r\nfingers he uttered a low wail and drew back underneath the warm pelt in\r\nwhich he was snugly wrapped.\r\n\r\nPoor Schneeboule! she gave a sigh as she saw him do this, but it didn’t\r\nprevent her from coming every minute or so and lifting one end of the\r\npelt just enough to take another look at Fuffcoojah, who, while he never\r\nfailed to cuddle up closer to me at sight of the princess, yet\r\ninvariably thrust out one of his black paws from under the pelt for\r\nSchneeboule to shake. While seated on the divan nearest the throne, I\r\nobserved that Phrostyphiz and Glacierbhoy were holding a whispered\r\nconference with his frigid Majesty. At once I guessed the subject of\r\ntheir conversation.\r\n\r\nRising to my feet, I made a sign that I wished to address the king, and\r\nwhen he had nodded his head with stern and icy dignity, I began to\r\nspeak. You know, dear friends, how eloquent I can be when the mood is\r\nupon me. Well, standing there almost upon the steps of King Gelidus’\r\nthrone of ice, I proceeded to defend myself against the charge of being\r\na master of the black art. I will not tell you all I said, but this was\r\nmy ending:\r\n\r\n“May it please your frigid Majesty!\r\n\r\n“Here beside me stands the only magician in the case, and the only art,\r\nthe only trick or charm which was exercised by him was that sweet power\r\nwe call love. When first he set eyes upon his four-footed brother locked\r\nin the crystal cell of Schneeboule’s Grotto, he pressed his nose again\r\nand again against its icy wall in vain attempt to know his kinsman, and\r\nturned away with a cry of sorrow to find that his keen scent could not\r\npenetrate to him. I cannot tell you how great was his joy when I laid\r\nFuffcoojah stiff and stark upon my divan, for I knew not then the scheme\r\nripening in Bulger’s mind. But later, all was plain enough. The loving\r\ndog leaves his master’s breast and carries his true and tender heart\r\nover to where Fuffcoojah lies, raises the pelt, crawls in beside him,\r\nand presses his warm breast firm and hard against his brother’s\r\nice-locked heart, and warms him into life again, then wakes me and tells\r\nme what he hath done.\r\n\r\n“This, Royal Gelidus and most noble Koltykwerps, is the only art that\r\nhath been used to bring Fuffcoojah back to life again, and to call it\r\nblack is to slander the sunshine, rail at the lily, and call the sweet\r\nbreath of heaven a vile and detestable thing!”\r\n\r\nWhen I had ended my speech I saw that Schneeboule had been weeping, and\r\nthat several of her tears stopped in their course down her cheeks hung\r\nthere sparkling like tiny diamonds in the soft light of the alabaster\r\nlamps, where the chill air of Gelidus’ palace had turned them into ice.\r\n\r\nAnd therefore when his frigid Majesty said that my words had touched his\r\nheart, and bade me ask for a gift from his hand, I said,—\r\n\r\n“O cold king of this fair icy domain, let those tears that now hang like\r\ntiny jewels on Schneeboule’s cheeks be brushed into an alabaster box and\r\ngiven to me. I covet no other guerdon!”\r\n\r\n“Even if I did not love thee, little baron,” cried King Gelidus with an\r\nicy smile, “I would be persuaded; but loving makes easy believing. Go,\r\nPhrostyphiz, and bid one of the princess’s women brush those tiny jewels\r\nthat hang on Schneeboule’s cheek into an alabaster cup and bestow them\r\nupon the little baron.”\r\n\r\nScarcely had this been done when Fuffcoojah thrust his head out from\r\nunder the pelt and, fixing his eyes pleadingly upon me, thrust out his\r\ntongue and opened and shut his mouth with a faint, smacking noise. Quick\r\nas a flash it dawned upon me that these signs meant that Fuffcoojah was\r\nhungry!\r\n\r\nAnd then, as I suddenly remembered that the Koltykwerps were strictly a\r\nmeat-eating people, that only meat was to be had in their chill domain,\r\nquarried almost like marble itself from nature’s great refrigerators, a\r\ngasp escaped my lips, and I whispered,—\r\n\r\n“Oh, he must die! He must die!” My words had not missed the keen ears of\r\nPrincess Schneeboule.\r\n\r\n“Speak, little baron,” she cried, “why, why, must little Fuffcoojah die?\r\nWhat dost mean by such a saying?” And when King Gelidus and Schneeboule\r\nhad heard me voice my fear that he would die rather than feed on meat,\r\nthey both became very heavy-hearted.\r\n\r\n“Poor little Fuffcoojah!” moaned the princess, “can it be possible that\r\nhe must be carried back so soon to his crystal cell in my grotto?”\r\n\r\n“Bid the master of my meat quarries approach the throne,” cried King\r\nGelidus suddenly, in a voice of icy dignity.\r\n\r\nThis important functionary soon made his appearance.\r\n\r\nTurning to me, the king bade me explain the case to him. This I did in a\r\nfew words, when, to the great joy of all present the master of the meat\r\nquarries spoke as follows:—\r\n\r\n“Little baron, if that’s the only trouble, give thyself no further\r\nuneasiness, for I shall at once send one of my men to thee with a supply\r\nof most delicious nuts.”\r\n\r\n“Delicious nuts?” I repeated in a tone of amazement.\r\n\r\n“Why, yes, little baron, I have a goodly supply on hand. Know, then,\r\nthat hardly a day goes by that my men don’t come upon some fine specimen\r\nof the family of gnawers, most generally squirrels, in whose\r\ncheek-pouches we invariably find from one to half a dozen dainty nuts\r\nstowed away. It has always been my custom to lay these aside, and so I\r\nhave to inform thee that if Fuffcoojah should live to be a hundred years\r\nold I or my successor could guarantee to keep him supplied with food.”\r\n\r\nThese words lifted a terrible load off my heart, for now, at least,\r\nFuffcoojah would not die of starvation.\r\n\r\nFor a few days everything went well. The Koltykwerps became quite\r\nsatisfied in their own minds that I had not been practising the black\r\nart in the chilly kingdom of his frigid Majesty, and each and every one\r\nof them became greatly attached to the curious little creature with the\r\ndroll little face and droller manner.\r\n\r\nBut it seemed as if we were no sooner out of one trouble than we were\r\nplumped into another, for now Fuffcoojah began to object to the\r\nattendant selected to look after him by King Gelidus.\r\n\r\nThe man was about ten degrees too cold-blooded for him, and ere long it\r\nwas only necessary for the Koltykwerp to approach Fuff,—as we called him\r\nfor short,—in order to throw him into convulsions of shivering and to\r\ncause him to utter pitiable cries of discontent, which only ceased upon\r\nmy appearing and comforting him by my caresses.\r\n\r\nI now set to work to devise some way to make Fuff’s life more agreeable\r\nto him, for everybody seemed to hold me responsible for his well being.\r\nTen times a day came messengers from King Gelidus or from Princess\r\nSchneeboule to ask how he was getting on, and whether we were keeping\r\nhim warm enough, whether he had all he wanted to eat, whether he had\r\npelts enough on his bed. Nor was it an unusual thing to have a score or\r\nmore Koltykwerpian mothers call at my quarters during a single day with\r\nadvice enough to last a month, and therefore was it that, with a view to\r\nproviding him with a warmer room to sleep in, I ordered a divan fitted\r\nup for him in a smaller chamber opening into mine, upon the walls of\r\nwhich I directed half a dozen of the largest lamps to be hung.\r\n\r\nThe consequence was that the walls began to melt, hearing of which,\r\nconsternation spread throughout the icy domain of his frigid Majesty,\r\nfor to the mind of a Koltykwerp heat powerful enough to melt ice was\r\nsomething terrible. It was like the dread of earthquake shock to us, or\r\nthe fear of flood or flame. It was something that filled their hearts\r\nwith such terror that in their dreams they saw the solid walls of the\r\nice palace melt asunder and fall with a crash. They could not bear it,\r\nand so King Gelidus put forth the decree that if there were no other way\r\nto keep Fuffcoojah alive, then must he die.\r\n\r\nHearing this, an awful grief came upon poor Schneeboule’s heart, for she\r\nhad learned to love little Fuff very dearly, and it set a knife in her\r\nbreast to think of losing him.\r\n\r\n“Never, never,” she cried, “shall I be able to set foot within my grotto\r\nif Fuffcoojah is put back into his crystal prison again, with his frozen\r\nsmile on his face as once used to be.” And seeking out her royal father\r\nshe threw herself at his knees and spoke as follows:—\r\n\r\n“O heart of ice! O frigid Majesty, let not thy child die of grief. There\r\nis an easy way out of all our trouble with dear little Fuffcoojah.”\r\n\r\n“Speak, beloved Schneeboule,” answered King Gelidus, “let me hear what\r\nit is.”\r\n\r\n“Why, cold heart,” said the princess, “the little baron hath plenty of\r\nwarmth stored away in his body, he hath enough for both himself and\r\nFuffcoojah into the bargain. Therefore, frigid father, command that a\r\ndeep, warm hood be made to the little baron’s coat, and that Fuffcoojah\r\nbe placed therein and be borne about by the little baron wherever he\r\ngoeth. He will soon grow accustomed to the slender burden and note it no\r\nmore.”\r\n\r\n“It shall be as thou wishest,” replied the king of the Koltykwerps; and\r\ncalling his trusty councillor, Glacierbhoy, he directed him to summon me\r\nat once to the throne-room. When I heard this terrible order issue from\r\nthe icy lips of King Gelidus my heart sank within me, and yet I dared\r\nnot disobey, I dared not murmur, for I it was who had cleft asunder the\r\ncrystal prison of the Little Man with the Frozen Smile; I who had made\r\nit possible for Bulger to warm him back to life again. Oh, poor, vain,\r\nweak, foolish boy that I had been, what was to become of me now?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\n  HOW A LITTLE BURDEN MAY GROW TO BE A GRIEVOUS ONE.—STORY OF A MAN\r\n    WITH A MONKEY IN HIS HOOD.—MY TERRIBLE SUFFERING.—CONCERNING THE\r\n    AWFUL PANIC THAT SEIZED UPON THE KOLTYKWERPS.—MY VISIT TO THE\r\n    DESERTED ICE-PALACE, AND WHAT HAPPENED TO FUFFCOOJAH.—END OF HIS\r\n    BRIEF BUT STRANGE CAREER.—A FROZEN KISS ON A BLADE OF HORN, OR HOW\r\n    SCHNEEBOULE CHOSE A HUSBAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nAh, little princess, how easy was it for thee to say that I would soon\r\ngrow accustomed to the slender burden and note it no more? How prone are\r\nwe to call light the burdens which we lay upon the shoulders of others\r\nfor our own benefit? True, Fuffcoojah was not as long as a horse, nor as\r\nbroad as an ox, and when in accordance with the king’s decree the hood\r\nhad been completed and the little animal was stowed away therein, close\r\nagainst my back so as to get a goodly share of the warmth of my body, it\r\nseemed to me that Schneeboule was right, that I would soon become\r\naccustomed to the load and note it no more. And so it seemed the second\r\nand the third day, but not on the fourth; for on that day the little\r\nload appeared to have gained somewhat in weight, and although I was\r\nquick to feign that it was not so when Princess Schneeboule quizzed me\r\nsaying,—\r\n\r\n“There, little baron, did I not tell thee that thou wouldst soon forget\r\nthat Fuffcoojah slept upon thy shoulders?” yet in my heart I felt that\r\nhe really had grown a mite heavier.\r\n\r\nOn the fifth day Bulger and I were bidden to a merry-making at the\r\npalace of ice, and as I rose from my divan to betake me thither,\r\nmethought I was strangely heavy-hearted, and so did Bulger, for he made\r\nseveral efforts to draw a smile, or a cheery tone, from me, but in vain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BARON’S FLIGHT TO THE ICE PALACE.]\r\n\r\nSuddenly I realized that there was a weight pressing against my back,\r\nno, not a heavy weight, but a weight all the same, and then I whispered\r\nto myself, “Why, if I am going to a merry-making, I’ll cast it off!” and\r\nthen I wakened from my deep abstraction and murmured,—\r\n\r\n“How strange that I should have forgotten that Fuffcoojah was in my\r\nhood?” And so I went to the merry-making with Fuffcoojah nestled between\r\nmy shoulders, and the Koltykwerps laughed at the little baron and his\r\nchild, as they called him, and drew near and raised the flap and peeped\r\nin at the curious creature within the hood, and when Fuffcoojah felt\r\ntheir icy breaths, he buried his nose in the fur and sighed and\r\nwhimpered. Then, for a moment, when the Princess Schneeboule came and\r\nsat beside me and praised me for my readiness to carry out her wishes,\r\nand thanked me so sweetly for my goodness to her, I forgot all about the\r\nlittle load laid upon me, and I ate the frozen tidbits from the royal\r\nkitchen, and laughed and joked with Lords Phrostyphiz and Glacierbhoy,\r\njust as had been my wont before Gelidus had decreed that Fuffcoojah\r\nshould make his bed on my shoulders.\r\n\r\nBut when the fête was over and I stepped from the broad portal of the\r\nice-palace and looked up at the mighty lens set in the mountain side,\r\nthrough which the moonlight of the outer world was streaming in subdued\r\nbut glorious splendor, I suddenly felt my legs bend under me, I\r\nstaggered from right to left, I clutched at shadows, I was, it seemed to\r\nme, about to be crushed beneath a terrible burden. I quickened my pace,\r\nI broke into a run, I threw my arms into the air as if I would cast off\r\nthe weight that was smothering me. And so I came to my lodging puffing,\r\npanting, gasping.\r\n\r\n“Why, what a fool am I!” was my first word when I had got my breath;\r\n“it’s only little Fuffcoojah on my back, stowed away in my fur hood. I\r\nmust be beside myself to have thought that a great monster was seated\r\nthere and that he was gradually pressing me down, crushing the life out\r\nof me by degrees, flattening me to the very ground, and I not able to\r\nescape from his terrible embrace or to squirm out from under his awful\r\nlimbs wrapt around my neck and body!”\r\n\r\nAll night long this monster was clinging to me, and urging me to a\r\nfaster pace, up and down, across and around, I knew not where, on\r\nbootless errands, ending only to begin again, on searches after nothing\r\nhidden nowhere, trying a thousand lids and finding every one locked,\r\nreturning home only to go forth again, up and away and out on\r\ninterminable highways vanishing in a point far on ahead, with that\r\ngrievous burden forever on my shoulders growing heavier and heavier,\r\ntill it seemed that I must go down with it into the dust. But no, it\r\nknew full well that it must not ride me to the death, so when I was\r\nready to drop, it threw off part of its weight to give me courage to\r\nbegin again. When the morning came my pulse was galloping and my cheeks\r\nwere on fire. I could feel the blood pounding against my temples, and it\r\nwas natural that my face should be crimsoned over with the flush of\r\nfever. Half in a daze I walked forth toward the grand staircase leading\r\nup to the ice palace, when suddenly I was startled by a fearful scream.\r\nI halted and looked up, when another and another burst upon my ears.\r\n\r\nThe terrified Koltykwerps were fleeing before me in every direction,\r\nshrieking as they fled,—\r\n\r\n“Fly, fly, brothers, the little baron is burning, the little baron is\r\nburning, fly, brothers, fly!”\r\n\r\nIn a few moments terror had seized upon every living creature in the icy\r\ndomain of King Gelidus. They fled from me in mad haste, taking refuge in\r\nthe distant caverns and corridors, filling the air with their wild\r\noutcries, no one being brave enough to halt and take a second look. My\r\ninflamed countenance filled them with such awful terror that they could\r\nonly tear along and cry,—\r\n\r\n“Fly, brothers, fly; the little baron is burning, the little baron is\r\nburning!”\r\n\r\nWith Bulger at my heels, I turned and sprang up the staircase with the\r\nintention of seeking out King Gelidus, and explaining the matter to him.\r\n\r\nBut he, too, had fled, and with him every sentinel and serving man,\r\nevery courtier and councillor. The palace was as still as death. I\r\nhastened through its silent corridors calling out,—\r\n\r\n“Schneeboule! Princess Schneeboule! Surely thou art not afraid of me?\r\nTurn back, I will not harm thee, I’m not burning! Turn back, oh, turn\r\nback!”\r\n\r\nWith this, I reached the throne-room; not a living creature was to be\r\nseen; the vast chamber was as still as death. I staggered to a divan,\r\nand pillowing my poor aching head on a cushion, I fell into a sound and\r\nrefreshing sleep.\r\n\r\nWhen I awoke, I rubbed my eyes and looked about me, and at first I\r\nthought that I was still alone in the great round chamber with its walls\r\nof ice; but no, there on the divan sat Schneeboule, and she smiled and\r\nsaid in mock displeasure,—\r\n\r\n“Thou art not a very watchful nurse, little baron, for in thy sleep thou\r\ndidst squeeze Fuffcoojah so tightly against a cushion, that he crawled\r\nout from thy hood and nestled in my arms.”\r\n\r\n“In thy arms, Schneeboule?” I exclaimed breathlessly, for I feared for\r\nthe worst, and springing up I drew aside the soft pelt which she had\r\nwrapped around Fuffcoojah, and there he lay, dead! Poor little beast, he\r\nhad been so happy to crawl into the arms of one he loved so dearly, and\r\nhad cuddled up closer and closer to her in search of greater warmth; but\r\nonly to come nearer and nearer to a heart that could not warm him; and\r\nso the insidious chill of death, which bringeth sweet and pleasant\r\ndrowsiness with it, had stole over him and he had died.\r\n\r\nAnd Schneeboule’s tears, freezing as they fell, now showered like a\r\ngentle hail of tiny gems upon the little dead beast, no longer\r\nFuffcoojah, but once again the Little Man with the Frozen Smile.\r\nPresently the Koltykwerps recovered from their senseless fear, and first\r\none by one, and then group-wise, they returned to their homes, King\r\nGelidus and his court coming back too, to the fair palace which they had\r\nabandoned in their wild fright when the cry had gone up that the little\r\nbaron was burning.\r\n\r\nEverybody was sorry to hear that Fuffcoojah had died the second time,\r\nand many were the frozen tears that dropped from the chilly cheeks of\r\nthe Koltykwerps as they looked upon the Little Man with the Frozen Smile\r\nas he lay on the white pelt beside the Princess Schneeboule.\r\n\r\nThat day we bore him back to the ice grotto, and having laid him in the\r\nhollow moulded by his body in the crystal block, it was closed again so\r\nskilfully by the king’s quarrymen that no eye was keen enough to note\r\nwhere the cleavage had been. And the same uncanny glint was in his eyes,\r\nand when the Koltykwerps saw this their icy hearts felt a cold shiver of\r\nsatisfaction, for not only was the Little Man with the Frozen Smile back\r\nin his crystal cell again, but all the fears and dreadful fancies which\r\nhis coming to life again had given rise to were past and gone forever,\r\nand peace and quiet and sweet contentment reigned throughout the icy\r\nrealm of his frigid Majesty Gelidus, King of the Koltykwerps!\r\n\r\nNow nothing remained to make his cold heart crack with joy but to see\r\nhis beloved child Schneeboule make choice of a husband. And he had not\r\nlong to wait, for one day upon entering the palace she saw a youth lying\r\nat the foot of the stairway overcome with sleep. In one hand he held an\r\nalabaster lamp, and in the other a new wick which he was about to fit\r\ninto it, for the youth was a lamp-trimmer in the ice palace of King\r\nGelidus; and when the Princess Schneeboule saw him lying there overcome\r\nwith sleep, she stooped and kissed him on the cheek, and passed on\r\nwithout another thought about the matter, one way or the other.\r\n\r\nAnd the kiss froze on the cheek of the lamp-trimmer, where Schneeboule\r\nhad pressed it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DEATH OF FUFFCOOJAH.]\r\n\r\nPresently King Gelidus came tramping into the hallway with his breath\r\nwhite upon his beard, and he saw the youth lying there, and the frozen\r\nkiss on his cheek, and he bade Glacierbhoy scrape the delicate frost\r\ncrystals from the youth’s face with a blade of polished horn.\r\n\r\n“What hast there, father of mine?” asked the princess, when she saw him\r\nbearing the blade of horn along so carefully.\r\n\r\n“A kiss which someone pressed upon the cheek of one of my lamp-trimmers,\r\nnow lying on the staircase overcome with sleep,” replied King Gelidus,\r\nin ringing, icy tones.\r\n\r\n“Why, father of mine,” exclaimed Princess Schneeboule, “now that thou\r\nspeakest of it, I really believe the kiss is mine, for I recollect\r\nkissing someone as I entered the palace, I was deep in thought, but no\r\ndoubt the youth pleased me as he lay there, asleep with lamp in one hand\r\nand wick in the other.”\r\n\r\nAnd that lamp-trimmer trimmed no more lamps in the ice palace of his\r\nfrigid Majesty Gelidus, King of the Koltykwerps.\r\n\r\nNo doubt he made Schneeboule a very good husband, and I’m quite sure\r\nthat she made him a good wife. I would have been glad to tarry for the\r\nnuptial feast, but that was out of the question. I had stayed too long\r\nalready.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\n  SOMETHING CONCERNING THE MANY PORTALS TO THE ICY DOMAIN OF\r\n    KING GELIDUS AND THE DIFFICULT TASK OF CHOOSING THE RIGHT\r\n    ONE.—HOW BULGER SOLVED IT.—OUR FAREWELL TO THE COLD-BLOODED\r\n    KOLTYKWERPS.—SCHNEEBOULE’S SORROW AT LOSING US.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs Bullibrain had once remarked, when there are many doors it’s a wise\r\nman who knows which is the right one to open; and this I found to be the\r\ncase when I attempted to take my departure from the icy domain of his\r\nfrigid Majesty, Gelidus, King of the Koltykwerps, for there was a\r\nbaker’s dozen of galleries, in each of which, upon exploring it, I came,\r\nafter a tramp of half a mile or so, up against a lofty gate of solid\r\nice, curiously carved and fitting the end of the gallery as a cork does\r\na bottle.\r\n\r\nNo doubt you are wondering why I didn’t make my way out of the\r\nKoltykwerpian kingdom by following the river: for the very good reason\r\nthat it went no farther than King Gelidus’s domain, emptying into a vast\r\nreservoir which apparently had a subterranean outlet, for its thick\r\ncovering of ice always remained at the same height.\r\n\r\nThe king’s quarrymen were ordered to hew an opening through whichever\r\ndoor I should point out as the one that I wished to pass through, but I\r\nwas informed by Phrostyphiz that according to the law of the land but\r\none door could be opened during any one year, so that if I found my way\r\nblocked and turned back again it would mean a delay of twelve months.\r\nBullibrain, with all his wisdom, was powerless to assist me, although I\r\nwas half inclined to think that he might have done so had he been\r\npermitted to investigate the secret records of the kingdom, carved upon\r\nhuge tablets of ice, and stored away in the vaults of the palace.\r\n\r\nThe fact of the matter is King Gelidus was so desirous of having me\r\nassist at the marriage feast of Princess Schneeboule, that he threw\r\nevery obstacle in my way that he could, without openly showing his hand.\r\nAnd Schneeboule herself by the dancing of her clear gray eyes gave me to\r\nunderstand that she, too, was hoping that I would make a mistake when I\r\ncame to point out the door which I wanted opened.\r\n\r\nBulger saw that I was in trouble, but couldn’t comprehend clearly what\r\nthat trouble was. He kept his eyes fastened upon me, however, watching\r\nmy every movement, hoping, no doubt, to solve the mystery.\r\n\r\nWhile sitting one day lost in thought over the very serious problem\r\nwhich I found myself called upon to solve, an idea struck me: I had\r\nnoticed that in the meat-quarries, the workmen often made use of\r\nsounding-rods, which were long pieces of polished bone, ending in flint\r\ntips. A Koltykwerpian quarryman by dexterously twisting this rod, was\r\nable to bore a hole six feet deep or more into the solid bed of ice when\r\ndesirous of ascertaining the position of a carcass in the meat quarry,\r\nand it occurred to me that by piercing the portals of ice which closed\r\ntheir various corridors I have spoken of, possibly Bulger’s keen scent\r\nmight recognize that current of air which would have in it the odor of\r\nearth and rock; in other words, make choice for me of the portal which\r\nopened on that corridor leading away from the icy domain of King Gelidus\r\nand not merely into some outlying chamber of his kingdom.\r\n\r\nHis frigid Majesty could not object to such experiments, for the law\r\nonly forbade the hewing of openings large enough for the hewer to pass\r\nthrough.\r\n\r\nKing Gelidus and half a dozen of his courtiers, looking stern and frigid\r\nand conversing in freezing tones, were present to see the experiment\r\ntried. Methought their icy lips clacked together with satisfaction when,\r\nat my request, one portal after another was pierced, but Bulger, after\r\nsniffing at the hole, turned away with a bewildered look in his eyes as\r\nif he didn’t half understand why I was ordering him to thrust his warm\r\nnose into such cold places.\r\n\r\nAnd so we tramped from corridor to corridor, until the quarrymen began\r\nto show signs of fatigue, and the sounding-rod turned slower and slower\r\nin their hands.\r\n\r\nPhrostyphiz blinked his cold gray eyes as much as to say, “Little baron,\r\nthou must bide with us for another year!” But I merely turned to the\r\nquarrymen, and ordered them to pierce one more portal of ice ere we\r\nabandoned the task for the day. They went at the work of piercing the\r\neleventh door with the pace of pack-mules up a mountain-side. But at\r\nlast the sounding-rod bored a way through, and at a wave of my hand the\r\nquarrymen fell back. In an instant Bulger had his nose at the hole, and\r\ntook three or four quick, nervous sniffs, ending with a long, deep-drawn\r\none, and then breaking out into a string of sharp, jerky, joyful barks,\r\nhe began scratching furiously at the bottom of the portal.\r\n\r\n“Your frigid Majesty,” said I, with a low and stately bend of my body\r\nsuch as only those born to the manner can make, “by this portal, at the\r\ncoming of to-morrow’s sun, I shall pass from your Majesty’s icy\r\ndominion!” And when Phrostyphiz and Glacierbhoy heard these words of\r\nmine uttered so loftily, their eyes gleamed cold as steel, and they\r\nfollowed the King in silence back to the palace of ice. Schneeboule met\r\nthem in the grand hallway; and when she had looked upon their faces she\r\nbegan to weep, for she loved me and she loved Bulger too, and her cold\r\nlittle heart could not bear the thought of our going.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KOLTYKWERPIAN QUARRYMEN HEWING A PASSAGE THROUGH THE WALL\r\nOF ICE.]\r\n\r\nKing Gelidus, however, soon recovered his spirits, and ordered a feast\r\nwith song and dance in honor of Bulger, who during the festivities sat\r\non the highest divan with the softest pelt beneath him; and so many were\r\nthe frozen tidbits which the Koltykwerps presented to him during the\r\nprogress of the feast, that I grew alarmed lest he might overload his\r\nstomach and not be in a fit condition to make the early start on our\r\njourney, of which I had given notice to the Koltykwerpian monarch. But\r\nhis good sense saved him from doing so foolish a thing; in fact, I was\r\ngreatly amused to see that, while he accepted every tidbit handed to\r\nhim, and solemnly went through the motions of chewing it, yet watching\r\nhis chance, he slyly dropped it out of his mouth and flirted it aside\r\nwith his paw. Thus was spent our last night at the icy court of his\r\nfrigid Majesty, and on the morrow the Koltykwerps collected in great\r\ncrowds on the different terraces to say good-by. I pressed a kiss on the\r\ncheek of Princess Schneeboule, and when it had turned to ice crystals,\r\none of her men brushed it into an alabaster box.\r\n\r\nPrince Chillychops, the former lamp-trimmer, was on hand with the rest\r\nof the Koltykwerpian nobles, but I flattered myself that Schneeboule\r\nloved me better than she did him. However, I wished him joy, and gripped\r\nhis cold palm with such warmth that he stood blowing it for a whole\r\nminute. When we reached the lofty portal we found that the quarrymen had\r\nalready hewn a passage through it, and near by I observed a pile of\r\nmassive blocks of ice, crystal clear.\r\n\r\nThese, when Bulger and I should pass through the opening, were to be\r\nused in walling it up again; and when I saw this pile of blocks, and\r\nremembered the solid workmanship of the Koltykwerpian quarrymen, the\r\nthought flitted through my mind: Suppose Bulger hath not chosen wisely,\r\nwhat use would there be in turning back, for my own weak hands would be\r\npowerless against a wall built of such blocks, and knock I ever so loud,\r\nhow could the sound ever traverse this long and winding corridor and\r\nreach the ear of a Koltykwerp? “No,” said I to myself, “if Bulger hath\r\nnot chosen wisely, it will be good-by to both upper and under worlds.”\r\nAnd then, bearing an alabaster lamp in one hand and in the other holding\r\nthe cord which I had tied to Bulger’s collar, I stepped through the\r\nnarrow passage hewn by the quarrymen, and turned my back forever on the\r\ncold dominion of Gelidus, King of the Koltykwerps. Once I halted and\r\nlooked back. I could see nothing, but I could hear the sharp click of\r\nthe flint axes as the quarrymen closed up the door that shut me out from\r\nso many cold but loving hearts. And then I drew a long breath and went\r\non my way again.\r\n\r\nAnd that was the last I ever saw of the Koltykwerps save in day dream or\r\nnight vision.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE WONDERFUL RIDE ON THE BLOCK OF ICE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\n  ALL ABOUT THE MOST TERRIBLE BUT MAGNIFICENT RIDE I EVER TOOK IN MY\r\n    LIFE.—NINETY MILES ON THE BACK OF A FLYING MASS OF ICE, AND HOW\r\n    BULGER AND I WERE LANDED AT LAST ON THE BANKS OF A MOST WONDERFUL\r\n    RIVER.—HOW THE DAY BROKE IN THIS UNDER WORLD.\r\n\r\n\r\nHad my hand at that moment not grasped a cord tied to the neck of my\r\nwise and keen-eyed Bulger, I really believe I would have come to a halt,\r\nfaced about, retraced my steps, and begged the inhabitants of this\r\ncrystal realm to admit me once more into the cold kingdom where Gelidus\r\nheld his icy court; for a sudden fit of depression came upon me as the\r\nchilly air struck against my cheeks and I saw the deep darkness made\r\nvisible by the tiny flame of my alabaster lamp.\r\n\r\nCold though it might be, I would have sunshine in the icy land of the\r\nKoltykwerps, but now how could I tell what fate awaited me?\r\n\r\nLuckily, I had asked the captain of the meat quarries to allow me to\r\nretain one of his sounding-rods with its flint point, for I feared lest\r\nin descending some icy declivity I might fall and bruise, or even break,\r\na limb.\r\n\r\nI was determined to advance cautiously along this icy passage, shrouded\r\nas it was in impenetrable gloom, and so different from the broad and\r\npolished pavement of the Marble Highway; and hence, hanging the lamp\r\nabout my neck, I proceeded to make use of the sounding-rod as an\r\nalpenstock, for which purposes it was admirably adapted. Suddenly Bulger\r\nhalted, gave a low whine of warning, and turned back. In an instant I\r\nknew that there was danger ahead, and letting myself drop on my hands\r\nand knees crawled carefully along to make an investigation of the\r\ndangerous spot in our route signalled by the watchful Bulger.\r\n\r\nIt was only too true: we stood apparently upon the very edge of a sheer\r\nparapet, how high I had no way of ascertaining, but I was unable to\r\nreach any bottom with the sounding-rod.\r\n\r\nWhat was to be done? Turn back?\r\n\r\nIt was not yet too late, the Koltykwerpian quarrymen could not have\r\ncompleted their task in so short a time, they would hear my knock, they\r\nwould tear down their wall of ice, and Gelidus and Schneeboule would\r\nwelcome us back to their ice palace with a cold, but honest\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\nAs I sat there plunged in thought, I half unconsciously began to twirl\r\nthe sounding-rod around until I had sunk it half its length into the\r\nfloor of ice, and then reaching out I encircled Bulger with my arm and\r\ndrew him up against me as was my wont when preparing for profound\r\nmeditation.\r\n\r\nI had scarcely done so when the ice beneath me gave one of those sharp,\r\nclear, cracking noises so unlike the sound made by the breaking of any\r\nother substance; and thereupon I felt the crystal mass on which Bulger\r\nand I were sitting tremble and vibrate for an instant, and then, with a\r\nsudden downward cant, break away from the mass behind it and begin to\r\nmove!\r\n\r\nInstinctively a sense of my awful peril prompted me to cling to the\r\nsounding-rod which I had sunk drill-like into the ice. Luckily it was\r\nbetween my legs, and quick as a flash I intwined them around it,\r\nassuming a Turkish sitting posture, while my left arm was wrapped\r\ntightly around Bulger’s body.\r\n\r\nI don’t know how it was done, done as it was all in an instant; but\r\nthere I sat now firmly saddled, so to speak, upon that crystal monster’s\r\nback, as with a creak and a crash it snapped the crystal links which\r\nbound it to the wall of ice and plunged headlong down the glassy slope.\r\n\r\nIn my fright I had dropped my lamp, and now the deep gloom of this under\r\nworld inwrapped me. But no, it was not so, for as the escaping block of\r\nice creaked and craunched its way along, the two cold crystal surfaces\r\ngave forth a weird glimmer of phosphorescent light which made the flying\r\nmass seem like a monstrous living thing, out of whose thousand eyes were\r\ndarting tongues of flame as it rushed madly along, now gaining speed\r\nupon striking a steeper stretch of way, now fouling with some\r\nobstruction and dashing against the rocky sides of the corridor, and\r\nsending a shower of crystals sparkling and glittering in the black air!\r\n\r\nAnon the escaping block comes upon a gentle slope, and with the low\r\nmusic of crushing crystals slips softly along in its flight as if\r\nmounted upon runners of polished steel, and then with a sudden dip it\r\nglides upon a sharper descent and fairly leaps into the air as it bounds\r\nalong, hissing over the slippery roadway, and leaving a train of fire\r\nbehind it. And now it strikes a stretch of way piled here and there with\r\nclumps and blocks of ice.\r\n\r\nWith a mad fury it springs upon the lesser ones with a growl of rage,\r\ngrinding them to powder, which, like showers of icy foam, it hurls upon\r\nBulger and me seated on its back. But some of the blocks resist its\r\nterrible onslaught and our mighty steed is hurled from side to side with\r\ncrash and creak, as it drives its crystal corners fiercely against the\r\njutting rocks, leaving marks of its white flesh on these black heads of\r\nadamant.\r\n\r\nIt seems an hour since the crystal monster broke away, and yet ever\r\ndownward he threads his wild flight, butting, bumping, jostling,\r\nveering, staggering along, bearing Bulger and me to the lowest level of\r\nthe World within a World.\r\n\r\nWill he never end his mad flight?\r\n\r\nIs there no way for me to curb him?\r\n\r\nMust he fly until he has ground his very body to such a thinness that\r\nthe next obstruction will shatter it into ten thousand pieces, and hurl\r\nBulger and me to death?\r\n\r\nAs these thoughts are flitting through my mind, the flying mass takes\r\none last mad plunge which lands it on an almost level stretch of\r\nroadway, and by the different sound given out by the sliding block, I\r\nknow that we have left the regions of ice behind us, and that our\r\ncrystal sledge is gliding gently along over a track of polished marble.\r\n\r\nBut, mile after mile, it still glides along, gently, softly, silently,\r\nand then I dare to think that our lives are saved.\r\n\r\nBut so terrible had been the strain, so fearful the anxiety, so\r\nexhausting the effort necessary to hold my place on the block of ice,\r\nand keep my beloved Bulger from slipping out of my arms, that I fell\r\nbackward into a dead faint as the gliding mass came, at last, to a\r\nstandstill. I think I must have lain there a good half hour or so; for\r\nwhen I came to myself Bulger’s frantic joy told me that he had been\r\nterribly wrought up over me, and the moment I opened my eyes he began to\r\nshower caresses on my hands and face in most lover-like style. Dear,\r\ngrateful heart, he felt that he owed his life this time to his little\r\nmaster, and he wanted me to understand how thankful he was.\r\n\r\nThe moment Bulger’s nerves had recovered from the shock occasioned by my\r\nprolonged faint, I reached for my repeater and touched its spring.\r\n\r\nIt registered one hour and a half since we had stepped through the icy\r\nportal of King Gelidus’ domain. Allowing a half-hour for the time I lay\r\nunconscious, it showed that our mad descent on the back of the crystal\r\nmonster had lasted quite a full hour, and reckoning the average speed of\r\nthe escaping mass of ice to have been a mile and a half a minute, that\r\nwe were now in the neighborhood of ninety miles away from the cold\r\nkingdom where Gelidus sat on his icy throne, and Princess Schneeboule at\r\nhis feet with Chillychops beside her.\r\n\r\nIt was with great difficulty that I could rise to my feet, so stiffened\r\nwere my joints and knotted my muscles after that terrible ride, every\r\ninstant of which I expected to be dashed to pieces against projecting\r\nrocks, or torn to shreds by being caught between the fleeing monster of\r\nice and the gigantic icicles hanging from the ceiling like the shining\r\nteeth of some huge creature of this under world.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE TROPICS OF THE UNDER WORLD.]\r\n\r\nBut could it be, dear friends, that Bulger and I had only escaped a\r\nquick and merciful ending to be brought face to face with a death ten\r\ntimes more terrible, in that it was to be slow and gradual, denied even\r\nthe poor boon of looking upon each other, for darkness impenetrable was\r\nfolded about us and silence so deep that my ears ached in their longing\r\nfor some sound to break it. And yet there was something in the sound of\r\nmy own voice that startled me when I used it: it seemed as if the awful\r\nstillness were angered at being disturbed by it, and smote it back into\r\nmy teeth.\r\n\r\nWhere are we? This was the question I put to myself, and then in my mind\r\nI strove to recall every word which I had read in the musty pages of Don\r\nFum’s manuscript concerning the World within a World; but I could\r\nrecollect nothing to enlighten me, not a word to give me hope or cheer,\r\nand I was about to cry out in utter despair when, happening to raise my\r\neyes and look off in the distance, I saw what seemed to me to be a\r\njack-a-lantern dancing along on the ground.\r\n\r\nIt was a strange and fantastic sight in this region of inky darkness,\r\nand for a moment I stood watching it with bated breath and wide-opened\r\neyes; but no, it could not be a will-with-the-wisp, for now the faint\r\nand uncertain glimmer had increased to a mild but steady glow, reaching\r\naway off in the distance like a long line of dying camp-fires seen\r\nthrough an enveloping mist.\r\n\r\nBut in a moment’s time this wide encircling ring of light had so\r\nincreased in brightness that it looked for all the world like a break o’\r\nday in the land o’ sunshine, and here and there where its mild\r\neffulgence overcame the darkness of this subterranean region, I caught\r\nsight of walls and arches and columns of snow-white marble. And then as\r\nI called to mind Don Fum’s mysterious reference to “sunrise in the lower\r\nworld,” I swung my hat and gave a loud cry of joy, while Bulger waked\r\nthe echoes of these spacious caverns by his barking. I tell you, dear\r\nfriends, not until you have been in just such a plight can you know just\r\nhow such a rescue feels.\r\n\r\nAnd now, no doubt, you are a bit anxious to know what sort of a sunrise\r\ncould possibly take place in this under world miles below our own.\r\n\r\nWell, when you have travelled as many miles as I have, and seen as many\r\nwonders as I have, you’ll be ready to admit that wonders are quite as\r\ncommonplace as commonplace itself. Know, then, that this vast region of\r\nthe World within a World was girt round about by a broad and placid\r\nstream whose waters swarmed with vast numbers of gigantic radiate\r\nanimals, such as polyps, sea-urchins, Portuguese men-of-war,\r\nsea-anemones, and the like; that these transparent creatures, which had\r\nthe power of emitting light, after lying dormant for twelve hours,\r\ngradually unfolded their bodies and tentacles, and rose toward the\r\nsurface of these calm and limpid waters, increasing by degrees their\r\nmysterious radiance, until they had chased the darkness from the vast\r\ncaverns opening upon the banks of the river, and lighted up this under\r\nworld with a soft effulgence somewhat brighter than the rays of our full\r\nmoon. For twelve hours these weird lanterns of the stream made it day\r\nfor this nether world, and then, as they gradually shrank together and\r\nsank out of sight, their expiring fires glowed with all the multicolored\r\nradiance of our fairest twilight, and the night, blacker than Stygian\r\ndarkness, came back again. But now ’twas full daylight, and bidding\r\nBulger follow me I walked in silent wonder along the banks of this\r\nglowing stream, which, like a band of mysterious fire, as far as my eye\r\ncould reach went circling around the white marble mouths of these vast\r\nunderground chambers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXXI\r\n\r\n  IN WHICH YOU READ OF THE GLORIOUS CAVERNS OF WHITE MARBLE FRONTING\r\n    ON THE WONDERFUL RIVER.—IN THE TROPICS OF THE UNDER WORLD.—HOW WE\r\n    CAME UPON A SOLITARY WANDERER ON THE BANKS OF THE RIVER.—MY\r\n    CONVERSATION WITH HIM, AND MY JOY AT FINDING MYSELF IN THE LAND OF\r\n    THE RATTLEBRAINS, OR HAPPY FORGETTERS.—BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THEM.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith every turn in the winding way that skirted the white shores of this\r\nwonderful stream, its swarms of light-emitting animals lent it a new\r\nbeauty; for as the day advanced—if I may so express it—they lifted their\r\nglowing bodies nearer and nearer to the surface, until now the river\r\nshone like molten silver; and as the sheer walls of rock on the opposite\r\nbank held set in them vast slabs of mica, the effect was that these\r\ngigantic natural mirrors reflected the glowing stream with startling\r\nfidelity, and threw the flood of soft light in dazzling shimmer against\r\nthe fantastic portals of the white marble caverns on this side of the\r\nstream. It was a scene never to forget, and again and again I paused in\r\nsilent wonder to feast my eyes upon some newly discovered beauty. Now,\r\nfor the first, I noted that every white marble basin of cove and inlet\r\nwas filled with a different glow, according to the nature of the tiny\r\nphosphorescent animals which happened to fill its waters,—one being a\r\ndelicate pink, another a glorious red, the third a deep rich purple, the\r\nfourth a soft blue, the fifth a golden yellow, and so on, the charm of\r\neach tint being greatly enhanced by the snowy whiteness of these marble\r\nbasins, through which long lines of curious fish scaled in hues of\r\npolished gold and silver swam slowly along, turning up their glorious\r\nsides to catch the full splendor of the light reflected from the mica\r\nmirrors. And now the chilly breath of King Gelidus’ domain no longer\r\nfilled the air. I stood in the tropics of the under world, so to speak;\r\nand but one thing was lacking to make my enjoyment of this fairy region\r\ncomplete, and that was some one to share it with me.\r\n\r\nTrue, Bulger had an idea of its beauty, for he testified his happiness\r\nat being once more in a warm land by executing some mad capers for my\r\namusement, and by scampering along the shore of the glowing river and\r\nbarking at the stately fish as they slowly fanned the water with their\r\nmany colored fins; but I must admit that I longed for the Princess\r\nSchneeboule to keep me company. But it was a rash wish; for the warm air\r\nwould have thrown her into convulsions of fear, and she would have\r\npreferred to meet her death in the cool river rather than attempt to\r\nbreathe such a fiery atmosphere. By this time I had advanced several\r\nmiles along the white shores of the glowing stream, and, feeling\r\nsomewhat fatigued, I was about to sit down on the jutting edge of a\r\nnatural bench of rock, which seemed almost placed on the river banks by\r\nhuman hands for human forms to rest upon and watch the wonderful play of\r\ntints and hues in this wide sweeping inlet, when, to my amazement, I saw\r\nthat a human creature was already sitting there.\r\n\r\nHis eyes were fixed upon the water, and methought that his face, which\r\nwas gentle and placid, wore a tired look. Certainly he was plunged into\r\nsuch deep meditation that he either took or feigned to take no notice of\r\nmy approach. Bulger was inclined to dash forward and attract his\r\nattention by a string of earsplitting barks, but I shook my head. This\r\nwanderer along the glowing stream of day wore rather a graceful\r\ncloak-like garment, woven of some substance that shimmered in the light,\r\nand so I concluded that it must be mineral wool. His head was bare, and\r\nso were his legs to the knees, his feet being shod with white metal\r\nsandals tied on with what looked like leathern thongs. All in all, he\r\nhad a friendly though somewhat peculiar look about him, and his attitude\r\nstruck me as being that of a person either plunged into deep thought, or\r\npossibly listening for some anxiously expected signal. At any rate,\r\naccustomed as I was to meet all sorts of people on my travels in the\r\nfour corners of the globe, I determined to make bold enough to interrupt\r\nthe gentleman’s meditations and wish him good-morrow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THROUGH THE REVOLVING DOOR.]\r\n\r\n“Whom have I the pleasure of meeting in this beautiful section of the\r\nWorld within a World?”\r\n\r\nThe man looked at me in a dazed sort of way and replied,—\r\n\r\n“I really don’t know, I’m happy to say.”\r\n\r\n“But, sir, thy name!” I insisted.\r\n\r\n“Forgot it years ago,” was his remarkable answer.\r\n\r\n“But surely, sir,” I exclaimed rather testily, “thou art not the sole\r\ninhabitant of this beautiful under world,—thou hast kinsman, wife,\r\nfamily?”\r\n\r\n“Ay, gentle stranger,” he replied in slow and measured tones, “there are\r\npeople farther along the shore, and they are good, dear souls, although\r\nI have forgotten their names, and I have, too, a very faint recollection\r\nthat two of those people are sons of mine. Stop! no, their names are\r\ngone from me too, I forgot them the day my own name slipped from my\r\nmind!” and as he uttered these words he threw his head back with a\r\nsudden jerk and I heard a strange click inside of it, as if something\r\nhad slipped from its place, and that instant a mysterious expression\r\nused by that Master of Masters, Don Fum, flashed through my mind.\r\n\r\nRattlebrains! Yes, that was it; and now I felt sure that I was standing\r\nin the presence of one of the curious folk inhabiting the World within a\r\nWorld, to whom Don Fum had given the strange name of Rattlebrains, or\r\nHappy Forgetters.\r\n\r\nI was so delighted that I could barely keep myself from rushing up to\r\nthis gentle-visaged and mild-mannered person, whose head had just given\r\nforth the sharp click, and grasping him by the hand. But I feared to\r\nshock him by such a friendly greeting, and so I contented myself with\r\ncrying out,—\r\n\r\n“Sir, thou seest before thee none other than the famous traveller, Baron\r\nSebastian von Troomp!” but to my great amazement and greater chagrin he\r\nsimply turned his strange eyes, with the far-away look, upon me for an\r\ninstant, and then resumed his contemplation of the beautifully tinted\r\nsheet of water, as if I hadn’t opened my mouth. It was the most\r\nextraordinary treatment that I had experienced since my descent into the\r\nunder world, and I was upon the point of resenting it, as became a true\r\nknight and especially a von Troomp, when Don Fum’s brief description of\r\nthe Rattlebrains, or Happy Forgetters, flitted through my mind.\r\n\r\nSaid he, “By the exercise of their strong wills they have been busy for\r\nages striving to unload their brains of the to them now useless stock of\r\nknowledge accumulated by their ancestors, and the natural consequence\r\nhas been that the brains of these curious folk, who call themselves the\r\nHappy Forgetters, relieved of all labor and strain of thought, have\r\nabsolutely shrunken rather than increased in size, so that with many of\r\nthe Happy Forgetters their brains are like the shrivelled kernel of a\r\nlast year’s nut and give forth a sharp click when they move their heads\r\nsuddenly with a jerk, as is often their wont, for they take great pride\r\nin proving to the listener that they deserve the name of Rattlebrain.\r\n\r\n“Nor do I need remind thee, O reader,” concluded Don Fum, in his\r\ncelebrated work on the “World within a World,” “that the chiefest among\r\nthe Happy Forgetters is the man whose head gives forth the loudest and\r\nsharpest click; for he it is who has forgotten most.”\r\n\r\nYou can have but a faint idea, dear friends, of my delight at the\r\nprospect of spending some time among these curious people—people who\r\nlook with absolute dread upon knowledge as the one thing necessary to\r\nget rid of before happiness can enter the human heart.\r\n\r\nNo joy can equal the Happy Forgetter’s when, upon clasping a friend’s\r\nhand, he finds that he has forgotten his very name; and no day is well\r\nspent in this land at the close of which the inhabitant may not\r\nexclaim,—\r\n\r\n“This day I succeeded in forgetting something that I knew yesterday!”\r\n\r\nAt last the Happy Forgetter rose from his seat and calmly walked away,\r\nwithout so much as wishing me good-day; but I was resolved not to be so\r\neasily gotten rid of, so I called after him in a loud voice, and Bulger,\r\nfollowing my example, raised a racket at his heels, whereupon he faced\r\nabout and remarked,—\r\n\r\n“Beg pardon, I had quite forgotten thee, I’m happy to say, and thy name\r\ntoo, I’ve forgotten that; let me see, Art thou a radiate?” (One of the\r\nanimals in the water.) I was more than half inclined to lose my temper\r\nat this slur, classing me, a back-boned animal, with a mere jelly-fish;\r\nbut under all the circumstances I thought it best to control myself, for\r\nI could well imagine that from the size of my head and the utter absence\r\nof all click inside of it, I was not destined to be a very welcome\r\nvisitor among the Happy Forgetters; and therefore, swallowing my injured\r\nfeelings, I made a very low bow, and begged this curious gentleman to be\r\nkind enough to conduct me to his people—among whom I wished to abide for\r\na few days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXXII\r\n\r\n  HOW WE ENTERED THE LAND OF THE HAPPY FORGETTERS.—SOMETHING MORE\r\n    ABOUT THESE CURIOUS FOLK.—THEIR DREAD OF BULGER AND ME.—ONLY A\r\n    STAY OF ONE DAY ACCORDED US.—DESCRIPTION OF THE PLEASANT HOMES OF\r\n    THE HAPPY FORGETTERS.—THE REVOLVING DOOR THROUGH WHICH BULGER AND\r\n    I ARE UNCEREMONIOUSLY SET OUTSIDE OF THE DOMAIN OF THE\r\n    RATTLEBRAINS.—ALL ABOUT THE EXTRAORDINARY THINGS WHICH HAPPENED TO\r\n    BULGER AND ME THEREAFTER.—ONCE MORE IN THE OPEN AIR OF THE UPPER\r\n    WORLD, AND THEN HOMEWARD BOUND.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Happy Forgetter pursued his way calmly along the winding path that\r\nskirted the glowing river, apparently, and no doubt really, unconscious\r\nof the fact that Bulger and I were following close at his heels. After\r\nhalf an hour or so of this silent tramp, he suddenly came to a\r\nstandstill, and with his placid countenance turned toward the light\r\nseemed to be so far away in thought that for several moments I hesitated\r\nto address him. But as there were no signs of his showing any\r\ndisposition to come to himself, I made bold to ask him the cause of the\r\ndelay.\r\n\r\n“I’m happy to say,” he remarked, without so much as deigning to turn his\r\nhead, “that I’ve forgotten which of these two roads leads to the homes\r\nof our people.”\r\n\r\nWell, this was a pleasant outlook to be sure, and, I don’t know what we\r\nshould have done had not Bulger solved the difficulty for us by making\r\nchoice of one of the paths and dashing on ahead with a bark of\r\nencouragement for us to follow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CAUGHT UP IN THE ARMS OF THE TORRENT.]\r\n\r\nWhen I assured the Happy Forgetter that he need have no fear as to the\r\nwisdom of the choice, he gave a start of almost horror at the\r\ninformation; for you must know, dear friends, that the Happy Forgetter\r\nhas more dread of knowledge than we have of ignorance. To him it is the\r\nmother of all discontent, the source of all unhappiness, the cause of\r\nall the dreadful ills that have come upon the world, and the people in\r\nit.\r\n\r\n“The world,” said one of the Happy Forgetters to me sadly, “was\r\nperfectly happy once, and man had no name for his brother, and yet he\r\nloved him even as the turtle-dove loves his mate, although he has no\r\nnames to call her by. But, alas, one day this happiness came to an end,\r\nfor a strange malady broke out among the people. They were seized with a\r\nwild desire to invent names for things; even many names for the same\r\nthing, and different ways of doing the same thing. This strange passion\r\nso grew upon them that they spent their lives in making them in every\r\npossible way harder to live. They built different roads to the same\r\nplace, they made different clothes for different days, and different\r\ndishes for different feasts. To each child they gave two, three, and\r\neven four different names; and different shoes were fashioned for\r\ndifferent feet, and one family was no longer satisfied with one\r\ndrinking-gourd. Did they stop here?\r\n\r\n“Nay, they now busied themselves learning how to make different faces to\r\ndifferent friends, covering a frown with a smile, and singing gay songs\r\nwhen their hearts were sad. In a few centuries a brother could no longer\r\nread a brother’s face, and one-half the world went about wondering what\r\nthe other half was thinking about; hence arose misunderstandings,\r\nquarrels, feuds, warfare. Man was no longer content to dwell with his\r\nfellow-man in the spacious caverns which kind nature had hollowed out\r\nfor him, piercing the mountains with winding passages beside which his\r\nnarrow streets dwindled to merest pathways.”\r\n\r\nIn the Land of the Happy Forgetters care never comes to trouble sleep,\r\nnor anxious thought to wear the dread mask of To-morrow!\r\n\r\nHappy the day on which this child of nature might exclaim: “Since morn\r\nI’ve forgotten something! I’ve unloaded my mind! It’s one thought\r\nlighter than it was!”\r\n\r\nHe was the happiest of the Happy Forgetters who could honestly say, I\r\nknow not thy name, nor when thou wast born, not where thou dwellest, nor\r\nwho thy kinsmen are; I only know that thou art my brother, and that thou\r\nwilt not see me suffer if I should forget to eat, or perish of thirst if\r\nI forget to drink, and that thou wilt bid me close my eyes if I should\r\nforget that I had laid me down to sleep.\r\n\r\nBulger’s and my arrival in the Land of the Happy Forgetters filled the\r\nhearts of these curious folk with secret dread. At sight of my large\r\nhead they all began to tremble like children in the dark stricken with\r\nfear of bogy or goblin, and with one voice they refused to permit me to\r\nsojourn a single brief half-hour among them; but gradually this sudden\r\nterror passed off a bit, and after a council held by a few of the\r\nyounger men, whose brains as yet completely filled their heads, it was\r\ndetermined that I might bide for another day in their land, but that\r\nthen the revolving door should be opened, and Bulger and I be thrust\r\noutside of their domain.\r\n\r\nFrom what Don Fum had written about the Happy Forgetters, I knew only\r\ntoo well that it would be useless for me to attempt to reverse this\r\ndecree; so I held my peace, except to thank them for this great favor\r\nshown me.\r\n\r\nThe daylight, if I may call it so, now began to wane, or rather the\r\nthousands of light-giving creatures swarming in the river now began to\r\ndraw in their long tentacles, close their flower-like bodies, and slowly\r\nsink to the bottom of the stream. I was quite anxious to see whether the\r\nHappy Forgetters would make any attempt to light up their cavernous\r\nhomes, or whether they would simply creep off to bed and sleep out the\r\nlong hours of pitchy darkness. To my surprise, I now heard the clicking\r\nof flints on all sides, and in a moment or so a thousand or more great\r\ncandles made of mineral wax with asbestos wicks were lighted, and the\r\ngreat chambers of white marble were soon aglow with these soft and\r\nsteady flames.\r\n\r\nThe Happy Forgetters were strictly vegetable eaters, feeding upon the\r\nvarious fungous plants growing in these caverns in great profusion,\r\ntogether with a very nutritious and pleasant tasting jelly made from a\r\nhardened gum of vegetable origin which abounded in the crevices of\r\ncertain rocks. There was still another source of food; namely, the nests\r\nof certain shellfish, which they built against the face of the rock,\r\njust above the surface of the river. These dissolved in boiling water\r\nmade an excellent broth, very much like the soup from edible birds’\r\nnests.\r\n\r\nThe clothes worn by the Happy Forgetters were entirely woven from\r\nmineral wool, which in these caverns gave a long and strong fibre of\r\nastonishing softness. The Rattlebrains were tolerably good metal-workers\r\ntoo, but contented themselves with fashioning only such articles as were\r\nactually necessary for daily use. Their beds were stuffed with dried\r\nseaweed and lichens, and Bulger and I passed a very comfortable night.\r\n\r\nAs I was forbidden to speak aloud, to ask a question, or to walk abroad\r\nunless in company with one of the selectmen, I was not sorry when the\r\nmoment came for the revolving door to be opened. The Happy Forgetters\r\nhad been led to believe that Bulger and I were a thousand times more\r\ndangerous than scaly monsters or black-winged vampires, and hence they\r\nheld themselves aloof from us, the children hiding behind their mothers,\r\nand the mothers peering through crack and crevice at us.\r\n\r\nThe size of my head inspired them with a nameless dread, and even the\r\nhalf-a-dozen of the younger and more courageous drew aside instinctively\r\nto let me pass.\r\n\r\nFor the first time in my life I was an object of horror to my\r\nfellow-creatures, but I had no hard thoughts against them! Timid\r\nchildren of nature that they were, to them I was as terrible an object\r\nas the torch-armed demon of destruction would be to us were he let loose\r\nin one of our fair cities of the upper world.\r\n\r\nAnd now the guard of Happy Forgetters had halted in front of what seemed\r\nto me to be a huge cask fashioned of solid marble, and set one-half\r\nwithin the white wall of the cavern to which they had led me. But on\r\nsecond glance I saw that there was a row of square holes around its\r\nbulge, like those in the top of a capstan.\r\n\r\nThe Happy Forgetters now disappeared for a moment, and when they joined\r\nme again each bore in hand a metal bar, the end of which he set in one\r\nof these holes, and then at a signal from the leader the huge\r\nhalf-circle of marble began to turn noiselessly around, exactly like a\r\ncapstan. As each man’s lever came to the wall, he shifted it to the\r\nfront again. Suddenly, to my amazement, I saw that the great marble cask\r\nwas hollow, like a sentry box; and you may judge of my feelings, dear\r\nfriends, upon being politely requested to step inside.\r\n\r\nDid I refuse to obey?\r\n\r\nNot I. It would have been useless, for was not the whole tribe of\r\nRattlebrains there to lay hands upon me and thrust me in?\r\n\r\nSo taking off my hat and making a low bow to the little group of Happy\r\nForgetters, I stepped within the hollow cask and Bulger did the same;\r\nbut not with so good a grace as his master, for, casting an angry glance\r\nat the inhospitable dwellers in these chambers of white marble, he\r\ngrowled and laid bare his teeth to show his contempt for them.\r\n\r\nNow the great marble cask began to revolve the other way and in a moment\r\nit was back in place again.\r\n\r\nI heard several sharp clicks as if a number of huge spring latches had\r\nsnapped into place, and then all was silent as the tomb, and I had\r\nalmost said as dark too; but no, I could not say that, for I looked out\r\ninto a low tunnel which ran past the niche in which Bulger and I were\r\nstanding, and to my more than wonder it was dimly lighted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HURLED OUT IN THE SUNSHINE.]\r\n\r\nI stepped out into it; it was as round as a cannon bore and just high\r\nenough for me to stand erect; and now I discovered whence the light\r\nproceeded. In the cracks and crevices of its walls grew vast masses of\r\nthose delicate light-giving fungous rootlets, the glow of which was so\r\nstrong that I had no difficulty in reading the writing on my tablets; in\r\nfact, I stood there for several minutes making entries by the light of\r\nthese bunches of glowing rootlets.\r\n\r\nThen the thought dashed through my mind,—\r\n\r\n“Which way shall I turn, to the right or to the left?”\r\n\r\nBulger comprehended the cause of my vacillation and made haste to come\r\nto my rescue. After sniffing the air, first in one direction and then in\r\nthe other, he chose the right hand, and I followed without a thought of\r\nquestioning his wisdom. Strange to say, he had not advanced more than a\r\nfew hundred rods before I noticed that there was a strong current of air\r\nblowing through the tunnel in the direction Bulger had taken.\r\n\r\nEvery moment it increased in violence, fairly lifting us from our feet\r\nand bearing us along through this narrow bore made by nature’s own hands\r\nand lighted too by lamps of her own fashioning. The motion of the air\r\nthrough this vast pipe caused bursts of mighty tones as if peeled forth\r\nby some gigantic organ played by giant hands. It was strange, but yet I\r\nfelt no terror as I listened to this unearthly music, although its depth\r\nof tone jarred painfully upon my ear-drums.\r\n\r\nBy the dim light of the luminous rootlets, I could see Bulger just ahead\r\nof me, and I was content. No shiver of fear ran down my back, or robbed\r\nmy limbs of their full power to resist the ever-increasing pressure of\r\nthe air. But as it grew stronger and stronger, half of my own accord and\r\nhalf because Bulger set the example, I broke into a run. Our pace once\r\nquickened it was impossible for me to slow up again. On, on, in a mad\r\nrace, my feet scarcely touching the bottom of the tunnel, I sped along,\r\nwhile the great pipe through which I was borne on the very wings of the\r\ngale sent forth its deep and majestic peal.\r\n\r\nThere was something strangely and mysteriously exciting in this race,\r\nand all that kept me from enjoying it to my full bent was the thought\r\nthat a sudden increase in the violence of the blast might toss me\r\nviolently on my face and possibly break an arm for me or injure me in\r\nsome serious way.\r\n\r\nAll at once the deep pealing forth of the organ-like tone ceased, and in\r\nits stead came the awful sound of rushing water. Before I had time to\r\nthink, it was upon me, striking me like a terrific blow from some\r\ngigantic fist wearing a boxing-glove. The next instant I was caught up\r\nlike a cork on a mountain torrent, swayed from side to side, twisted,\r\nturned, sucked down and cast up again, whirled over and over, tossed and\r\ntumbled, rolled along like a wheel, my arms and legs the spokes!\r\n\r\nWonderful to relate, I did not lose consciousness as this terrible\r\ncurrent shot me like a stick of timber through a flume, whither I knew\r\nnot, only that the speed and volume went ever on increasing until at\r\nlast the tumultuous torrent filled the tunnel, and robbed me of light,\r\nof breath, of life, of everything, including my faithful and loving\r\nBulger!\r\n\r\nHow long it lasted—this fearful ride in the arms of these mad waters,\r\nrushing as if for life or death through this narrow bore—I know not; I\r\nonly know that my ears were suddenly assailed with a mighty whizz and\r\nrush of water as through the nozzle of some gigantic hose, and that I\r\nwas shot out into the glorious sunshine, out into the grand, free, open\r\nair of the upper world, and sent flying up toward the dear, blue sky\r\nwith its flecks of fleecy cloudlets, and Bulger some twenty feet ahead\r\nof me, and that then, with a gracefully curved flight through the soft\r\nand balmy air of harvest time, we both were gently dropped into a quiet\r\nlittle lake nestled at the foot of a hillside yellow with ripened corn.\r\nIn a moment or so we had swum ashore. Bulger wanted to halt and shake\r\nthe water from his thick coat, but I couldn’t wait for that. Wet as he\r\nwas, I clasped him to my heart while he showered caresses on me. But not\r\na word was said, not a sound was uttered. We were both of us too happy\r\nto speak, and if you have ever been in that state, dear friends, you\r\nknow how it feels.\r\n\r\nI can’t describe it to you.\r\n\r\nAt this moment some men and boys clad in the garb of the Russian peasant\r\ncame racing across the fields to see what I was about, no doubt, for I\r\nhad stripped off my heavy outside clothing, and was spreading it out in\r\nthe sun to dry.\r\n\r\nUpon sight of these red-cheeked children of the upper world I was so\r\novercome with joy that for a minute or so I couldn’t get a syllable\r\nacross my lips, but making a great effort I cried out,—\r\n\r\n“Fathers! Brothers! Where am I? Speak! dear souls!”\r\n\r\n“In north-eastern Siberia, little soul,” replied the eldest of the\r\nparty, “not far from the banks of the Obi; but whence comest thou? By\r\nSaint Nicholas, I believe thou wast spit out of the spouting well! What\r\nart thou doing here alone?”\r\n\r\nI paid no attention to the question. I was thinking of something else of\r\nmore importance to me, to wit: my splendid achievement, the marvellous\r\nunderground journey I had just completed, fully five hundred miles in\r\nlength, passing completely under the Ural Mountains! After a short stay\r\nat the nearest village, I engaged the best guide that was to be had, and\r\ncrossing the Urals by the pass in the most direct line, re-entered\r\nRussia and made haste to join the first government train on its way to\r\nSt. Petersburg.\r\n\r\nHaving despatched an _avant courier_ with letters to my beloved parents,\r\ninforming them of my good health and whereabouts, I passed several weeks\r\nvery pleasantly in the Russian capital, and then by easy stages set out\r\nfor home.\r\n\r\nThe elder baron came as far as Riga to meet me, and brought me the best\r\nof news from Castle Trump, that my dear mother was in perfect health,\r\nand that she and every man, woman, and child in and about the castle\r\nwere anxiously waiting to give me a real German welcome back home again.\r\nAnd here, dear friends, _mit herzlichen Grüsse_, Bulger and I take our\r\nleave of you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         By INGERSOLL LOCKWOOD\r\n\r\n\r\n  THE TRAVELS AND ADVENTURES OF LITTLE BARON TRUMP AND HIS WONDERFUL\r\n    DOG BULGER\r\n\r\n           Illustrated by GEORGE WHARTON EDWARDS Cloth $2.00\r\n\r\n  THE WONDERFUL DEEDS AND DOINGS OF LITTLE GIANT BOAB AND HIS TALKING\r\n    RAVEN TABIB\r\n\r\n               Illustrated by CLIFTON JOHNSON Cloth $2.00\r\n\r\n  EXTRAORDINARY EXPERIENCES OF LITTLE CAPTAIN DOPPELKOP ON THE SHORES\r\n    OF BUBBLELAND\r\n\r\n               Illustrated by CLIFTON JOHNSON Cloth $2.00\r\n\r\n  BARON TRUMP’S MARVELLOUS UNDERGROUND JOURNEY\r\n\r\n           Illustrated by CHARLES HOWARD JOHNSON Price $2.00\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            Little Baron Trump and His Wonderful Dog Bulger\r\n\r\n\r\n                             PRESS NOTICES\r\n\r\n  =BOSTON TIMES.= “Mr. Ingersoll Lockwood is nothing if not\r\n    original—and he _is_ original. The most partial critic would not\r\n    dare to deny him that desirable gift after a glance at his ‘Little\r\n    Baron Trump.’ Like the great Munchausen, the little Baron has a\r\n    passion for travel, a lust of adventure, a fever of imagination.\r\n    He sees, says, and does queer things; accidents never heard of\r\n    outside the lunatic asylums and Mr. Lockwood’s pages test his\r\n    resources at every hand; to ‘grapple with an emergency’ is beneath\r\n    him—he simply walks over it. We owe Mr. Lockwood thanks, too, for\r\n    that he has neglected to wrap a moral around his tales, and has\r\n    given us simply a delightful example of the art of sustained\r\n    fooling.”\r\n\r\n  =UTICA HERALD.= “A book which might easily be rated one of the\r\n    posthumous chapters of the ‘Arabian Nights,’ so far as its style\r\n    goes, and possessing, as the little Baron observes, ‘an almost\r\n    Oriental exuberance of fancy.’ The pictures by Mr. Edwards are\r\n    very comical, and as ingenious as they are quaint. But they are\r\n    hardly as wonderful as the doings of the young Baron and his more\r\n    wonderful confidant, Bulger. Surely never was such another dog as\r\n    he.”\r\n\r\n  =NATIONAL TRIBUNE.= “The travels and adventures of Baron Trump and\r\n    the bulldog are indeed extraordinary, even more so than those of\r\n    ‘Sinbad the Sailor.’ The book is full of quaint humor,\r\n    side-splitting at times. The Baron is an extremely precocious\r\n    youngster, and Bulger, though he cannot talk, is gifted with the\r\n    worldly wisdom and acuteness of a Prime Minister.”\r\n\r\n  =WOMAN’S CYCLE.= “Poor Munchausen won his reputation in the nick of\r\n    time. A few generations later and he would have had no chance at\r\n    all. His inventive genius would have fallen below that of a\r\n    reporter for a ‘great’ daily. Imagination is accustomed nowadays\r\n    to astounding flights. It performs a series of them in this book,\r\n    which is also illustrated so comically as to make the small boy\r\n    sit on the floor and wriggle with delight, while his elders guffaw\r\n    boisterously. It is, in fact, a ‘funny’ book.”\r\n\r\n  =NEW YORK SUN.= “A very whimsical and ingenious tale is that\r\n    entitled ‘Little Baron Trump and His Wonderful Dog Bulger.’ Young\r\n    or old readers will appreciate the humor of the author. The\r\n    illustrations by George Wharton Edwards admirably supplement the\r\n    text.”\r\n\r\n  =ALTA CALIFORNIAN.= “Heathen mythology, ‘The Arabian Nights,’ and\r\n    the modern fairy tale are brought to mind by the wonderful scenes,\r\n    but there is no evidence of plagiarism, startling originality\r\n    being far more in the author’s line than surreptitious imitation.\r\n    Many of the marvels are ingeniously founded on the scientific\r\n    theories of recent years, and satires on popular shortcomings or\r\n    delusions are conveyed in the guise of some perilous experience.\r\n    The author has evidently given full but harmless rein to an\r\n    original and prolific imagination.”\r\n\r\n  =PORTLAND TELEGRAM.= “One of the most interesting stories for young\r\n    people ever issued by an American publisher. Its humor is\r\n    contagious, its fun rollicking, while the variety and astonishing\r\n    nature of the experiences of the pair holds the reader captive\r\n    until the end. The illustrations by Wharton Edwards lend an added\r\n    charm to the work.”\r\n\r\n  =N. Y. TRIBUNE.= “Mr. Lockwood’s clever book, though modelled, no\r\n    doubt, on Munchausen’s narrative, has a whimsical originality of\r\n    invention which the first Baron might have envied. It is a\r\n    question whether the very youthful reader will fully appreciate\r\n    all the fun which an older reader finds therein; but it is certain\r\n    that the book will not be dropped until the last prodigious\r\n    adventure is absorbed. As a book of fantastic impossibilities,\r\n    gravely set forth, it is the most attractive devised in many a\r\n    season.”\r\n\r\n  =PUBLIC OPINION.= “One of the jolliest and most rollicking stories\r\n    of the year. It is an old-time children’s story, full of marvel,\r\n    mystery, and adventure. The author, Ingersoll Lockwood, has\r\n    succeeded in writing a capital boy’s book that is at once\r\n    fascinating and wholesome, as well as being good literature. The\r\n    abundant illustrations, drawn by George Wharton Edwards, are\r\n    admirably executed, and form a strong re-enforcement to the\r\n    interest as well as the beauty of the work.”\r\n\r\n  =SACRAMENTO BEE.= “A clean, well written, interesting children’s\r\n    book, but its adventures are so wonderful and so quaintly told\r\n    that many a parent who would buy the book as a Christmas present\r\n    for his children would be beguiled into reading it for his own\r\n    amusement.”\r\n\r\n  =ST. PAUL DISPATCH.= “It is a fanciful tale with a healthy tone\r\n    throughout. Moreover, it is put in an attractive form, the cover\r\n    being an unique combination of gray, black and brown, while the\r\n    print is clear and the illustrations very attractive. ‘Bulger’ was\r\n    Little Baron Trump’s companion from his birth; the relation of his\r\n    attachment for his master and their adventures among strange\r\n    peoples and in new countries is very entertaining. The book will\r\n    be heartily welcomed by both boys and girls, and it is a safe book\r\n    to place in their hands.”\r\n\r\n  =BROOKLYN EAGLE.= “A delightfully absurd and sarcastic boy’s story\r\n    is ‘Little Baron Trump and His Wonderful Dog Bulger,’ with equally\r\n    absurd and wonderful illustrations. It is as remarkable for its\r\n    powers of absurdity as ‘Gulliver’s Travels’ or ‘Alice in\r\n    Wonderland,’ if not so sarcastic as the first, and the\r\n    illustrations are not merely absurd travesties, but works of art\r\n    characteristically and in drawing. Bulger is truly a wonderful\r\n    dog, but no more wonderful than his phenomenally brainy young\r\n    master and the great variety of preposterous people he falls in\r\n    with.”\r\n\r\n  =CHRISTIAN STANDARD.= “One of those strange, whimsical, julesvernish\r\n    romances which, while they have neither mission nor moral, plot or\r\n    purpose, are strangely fascinating to children. This quaint and\r\n    curious volume of never-to-be-forgotten lore is rendered the more\r\n    attractive by numerous grotesque, giggles-begetting illustrations,\r\n    by George Wharton Edwards.”\r\n\r\n  =HEALTH AND HOME.= “This work will delight both young and old. It\r\n    gives a series of ludicrous adventures of the Little Baron and his\r\n    famous dog that are not only amusing, but, in many cases, point\r\n    useful morals. It contains over 300 pages, all of which brim over\r\n    with genuine humor, and is just the book for boys who are wearing\r\n    their first pants, or even of a larger growth.”\r\n\r\n  =MINNEAPOLIS TRIBUNE.= “A romance of wonderland, for old and young.\r\n    It would be difficult to find a volume of adventures which would\r\n    surpass Mr. Lockwood’s presentations of the wonders of travel, and\r\n    of the deeds of the valiant heroes who trumpet their bravery and\r\n    daring after laughable and amusing style.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n          Little Captain Doppelkop on the Shores of Bubbleland\r\n\r\n\r\n                             PRESS NOTICES\r\n\r\n  =CLEVELAND PLAINDEALER.= “Ingersoll Lockwood, who delighted and\r\n    bewildered readers young and old with those queer extravaganzas,\r\n    ‘Little Baron Trump’ and ‘Little Giant Boab,’ has perpetrated\r\n    another joke of the same kind in his ‘Extraordinary Experiences of\r\n    Little Captain Doppelkop on the Shores of Bubbleland.’ The boy,\r\n    who was twins in himself, a sort of juvenile Dr. Jekyll and Mr.\r\n    Hyde, has a lot of surprising and comical adventures that are\r\n    narrated by himself—or perhaps we ought to say more truthfully,\r\n    though ungrammatically, ‘themself’—with delightful simplicity.”\r\n\r\n  =BOSTON HOME JOURNAL.= “For its quaint conceptions it has never been\r\n    surpassed, if equalled, by anything of the kind. The idea of\r\n    creating a character like that of Little Captain Doppelkop was a\r\n    great stroke of genius. The adventures of the Little Captain in\r\n    Bubbleland are of the most marvellous character, and constantly\r\n    lead from one surprise to another still more surprising, and they\r\n    are related with a sparkle and naturalness that keep the reader’s\r\n    high interest continually on the topmost round of expectancy. If\r\n    Mr. Lockwood can beat his own record on this extravaganza, then he\r\n    will indeed stand the champion imaginator of the world.”\r\n\r\n  =NORTHWESTERN MAGAZINE.= “Ingersoll Lockwood has quite outdone\r\n    himself this time. The trouble is there are 287 large pages of\r\n    pure enjoyment and fun for your open-mouthed boys, and the small\r\n    ones won’t let you stop till you’ve read them every one, not to\r\n    speak of letting them take the book at every page or two to look\r\n    at the droll pictures which Clifton Johnson has so fitted to the\r\n    text. ‘Little Captain Doppelkop’ was two children rolled into one,\r\n    and their adventures in Glaucus’ Gluepot, Bubbleland, the Castle\r\n    of Indolence, and elsewhere—all kept even poor old me interested.\r\n    The book is bound prettily in gray-green, touched up with darker\r\n    and gold; just the book for your boy’s Xmas tree.”\r\n\r\n  =THE HOUSEKEEPER.= “‘Little Captain Doppelkop,’ being the\r\n    extraordinary experiences of the oddest and most amusing little\r\n    fellow that ever made or found his way from wonderful babyhood and\r\n    its mysteries out into the big, crazy world. Ingersoll Lockwood,\r\n    the author of this book, makes it his business to stow away a lot\r\n    of sense into a hundred small packets of nonsense, so that the boy\r\n    or girl who reads the three hundred pages that tell all about the\r\n    impossible absurdities of the little Captain will be the happier\r\n    and the wiser.”\r\n\r\n  =BOSTON COURIER.= “This we confess to finding one of the most\r\n    amusing and ingenious books of its kind that has been written in\r\n    our time. It is spontaneous and sparkling, and there is throughout\r\n    an unfailing succession of novel surprises such as only the most\r\n    fantastically fertile fancy could have devised. The central idea,\r\n    that of the boy who was really two persons, is a capital one, good\r\n    enough to make the fortune of any book, and it is capitally\r\n    carried out.”\r\n\r\n  =NEW LONDON TELEGRAPH.= “‘Little Captain Doppelkop’ is an\r\n    extravaganza as curious as was ever conceived and depicted in\r\n    prose and picture. Ingersoll Lockwood showed in ‘Little Baron\r\n    Trump’ how possible it was to be a delightful yet perfectly\r\n    unobjectionable Munchausen. ‘Little Captain Doppelkop,’ from\r\n    beginning to end, is filled with entrancing and absorbing\r\n    adventures, and the facile pencil fully supplements the pen. No\r\n    such work has been attempted by American writers, and the great\r\n    success which attended Mr. Ingersoll in his former achievement\r\n    cannot fail to be repeated now. The spirit, energy, and simple way\r\n    in which the narrative seems to hug the possible render it so\r\n    effective that whoever takes it up finds himself turning page\r\n    after page until he unwillingly comes to the last.”\r\n\r\n  =BOSTON GLOBE.= “‘Little Captain Doppelkop’—why ‘Doppelkop’ it is\r\n    necessary to read—is bound to be a tremendous success, and\r\n    deserves a place as a child’s classic with those which delighted\r\n    our boyhood.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n             Little Giant Boab and His Talking Raven Tabib\r\n\r\n\r\n                             PRESS NOTICES\r\n\r\n  =NEW YORK TRIBUNE.= “‘The Wonderful Deeds and Doings of Little Giant\r\n    Boab and his Talking Raven Tabib’ takes higher rank than any other\r\n    book of the season intended for young people, and is indeed even\r\n    cleverer than its amusing predecessor, which recounted the\r\n    adventures of Baron Trump and his delightful dog Bulger. In this\r\n    story of a mighty young Spanish giant, Tabib, the raven, plays the\r\n    guiding, protecting, and humorous part taken by Bulger in Mr.\r\n    Ingersoll Lockwood’s first story, and his somewhat cynical\r\n    shrewdness and hearty affection for his master make the ‘little\r\n    gentleman in black’ a very winning figure. With the humorous tone\r\n    of the book is blent a sweet and kindly spirit that much enhances\r\n    the charms of its wild adventures.”\r\n\r\n  =CRITIC, NEW YORK.= “‘Boab’ is short for Boabdil de Clavigero, and\r\n    the appellative ‘Little Giant’ but faintly indicates the prodigies\r\n    of strength and valor performed by this marvellous child, in an\r\n    elaborately erudite introduction, bristling with indisputable\r\n    citations in black-letter from sixteenth-century travellers, our\r\n    clever author seeks to dispel any possible doubt as to the real\r\n    existence of his hero. Ingenious Mr. Lockwood! don’t you know that\r\n    the day is past when we youngsters used to query ‘Is it true?’ Few\r\n    will concern themselves, as they follow with breathless eagerness\r\n    the career of this precocious boy, to discover the dividing line\r\n    between fact and fancy. There seems to be no limit to the author’s\r\n    imagination, and Boab is brought bravely out of one combination of\r\n    perils only to be involved in another still more alarming. Nothing\r\n    is impossible to his strong arm and quick wit, and whether\r\n    shouldering a massive castle-door, or tripping up El Gran Capitan\r\n    and pinning him to the floor with a two-ton statue, or vanquishing\r\n    the frightful man-bat, or getting ahead of the wall of living\r\n    stones, or driving the cardinal through night and tempest, over\r\n    the mountains to the Malaga, he is in all the same plucky,\r\n    invincible, good-natured little fellow—with whom every year will\r\n    be loth to part. Fun, novelty, satire, pathos—these are a few of\r\n    the elements that make this a most attractive book for the young.”\r\n\r\n  =BROOKLYN STANDARD UNION.= “It is a pretty hard thing to invent a\r\n    really new fairy tale, so completely has the ground been gone over\r\n    by the old veteran story-tellers; but in ‘Little Giant Boab’ Mr.\r\n    Lockwood has given the young folk a tale which is in many respects\r\n    original, which contains many new situations and ingenious\r\n    inventions, which is whimsical to the last degree, full of subtle\r\n    humor and rollicking fun. It is a delightful tale, that will be\r\n    quite as successful as ‘Little Baron Trump and his Wonderful Dog\r\n    Bulger,’ which made such a hit last season. The funny and\r\n    wonderful doings of Giant Boab and his raven, with the humorous\r\n    account of Boab’s ancestors, his appearance in Queen Isabel’s\r\n    court, his feats of strength, his exploits in the Spanish camp,\r\n    together with all his subsequent journeyings, will be read and\r\n    listened to and talked over in many a household during the coming\r\n    holidays. The illustrations, too, are in admirable keeping with\r\n    the spirit of the story, and fitly supplement as well as adorn the\r\n    text. Giant Boab is destined to be a formidable rival to Baron\r\n    Munchausen himself.”\r\n\r\n  =BOSTON BEACON.= “Ingersoll Lockwood has seized an old Moorish\r\n    legend and made use of it to furnish a first-rate fairy tale which\r\n    will delight the children almost as much as older folk are\r\n    delighted with ‘Don Quixote.’ Little Giant Boab is as interesting\r\n    a character as Hop O’ My Thumb of English birth, and incidental to\r\n    his adventures valuable insight into the customs and ways of Spain\r\n    is afforded. The book has many wood-cuts by Clifton Johnson. Mr.\r\n    Lockwood displays astonishing versatility, unlimited powers of\r\n    invention, unfailing humor, and a satirical purpose which seems to\r\n    be so closely interwoven with the whole narrative that its force\r\n    depends altogether on the reader’s capacity of comprehension. Like\r\n    Swift’s ‘Gulliver’ tales, the stories of the exploits of the\r\n    Little Giant will be a source of unending entertainment to the\r\n    young, while their elders will relish the clever manner in which\r\n    all sorts of human weaknesses are exhibited in the light of\r\n    wholesome ridicule. Mr. Clifton Johnson has added a large number\r\n    of illustrations admirably suited to the text.”\r\n\r\n  =ZION’S HERALD.= “This is a fairy tale which will especially delight\r\n    the children. Tabib was a sly and cunning bird, but Boab was a\r\n    good and brave boy; and putting these two together and setting\r\n    them off, to take together whatever adventures may befall them, is\r\n    sure to create a fascinating interest in them for the young. And\r\n    then, too, the pictures are so many, and in many cases so funny,\r\n    that this will be another source of pleasure to the reader.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                   LEE AND SHEPARD Publishers Boston\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n 1.
