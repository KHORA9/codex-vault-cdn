The account of the first\r\nplan of the moon is a sketch, as accurate as was needed,\r\nof the old chat and dreams, plans and jokes, of our\r\ncollege days, before he left Cambridge in 1838.  As I\r\nlearned almost everything I know through his care and\r\nlove and help, directly or indirectly, it is a pleasure\r\nto say this here.  The story was published in the\r\n\"Atlantic Monthly,\" in 1870 and 1871.  It was the last\r\nstory I wrote for that magazine, before assuming the\r\ncharge of \"Old and New,\" a magazine which I edited from\r\n1870 to 1876, and for which I wrote \"Ten Times One is\r\nTen,\" which has been printed in the third volume of this\r\nseries.\r\n\r\nAmong the kind references to \"The Brick Moon\" which\r\nI have received from sympathetic friends, I now recall\r\nwith the greatest pleasure one sent me by Mr. Asaph Hall,\r\nthe distinguished astronomer of the National Observatory.\r\nIn sending me the ephemeris of the two moons of Mars,\r\nwhich he revealed to this world of ours, he wrote, \"The\r\nsmaller of these moons is the veritable Brick Moon.\"\r\nThat, in the moment of triumph for the greatest\r\nastronomical discovery of a generation, Dr. Hall should\r\nhave time or thought to give to my little parable,--this\r\nwas praise indeed.\r\n\r\nWriting in 1870, I said, as the reader will see on\r\npage 66, that George Orcutt did not tell how he used a\r\nmagnifying power of 700.  Nor did I choose to tell then,\r\nhoping that in some fortunate winter I might be able\r\nmyself to repeat his process, greatly to the convenience\r\nof astronomers who have not Alvan Clark's resources at\r\nhand, or who have to satisfy themselves with glass lenses\r\nof fifteen inches, or even thirty, in diameter.  But no\r\nsuch winter has come round to me, and I will now give\r\nOrcutt's invention to the world.  He had unlimited\r\nfreezing power.  So have we now, as we had not then.\r\nWith this power he made an ice lens, ten feet in\r\ndiameter, which was easily rubbed, by the delicate hands\r\nof the careful women around him, to precisely the\r\nsurface which he needed.  Let me hope that before next\r\nwinter passes some countryman or countrywoman of mine\r\nwill have equalled his success, and with an ice lens will\r\nsurpass all the successes of the glasses of our time.\r\n\r\nThe plan of \"Crusoe in New York\" was made when I was\r\nenjoying the princely hospitality of Henry Whitney\r\nBellows in New York.  The parsonage in that city\r\ncommanded a view of a \"lot\" not built on, which would\r\nhave given for many years a happy home to any disciple of\r\nMayor Pingree, if a somewhat complicated social order had\r\npermitted.  The story was first published in Frank\r\nLeslie's illustrated paper.  In reading it in 1899, I am\r\nafraid that the readers of a hard, money generation may\r\nnot know that \"scrip\" was in the sixties the name for\r\nsmall change.\r\n\r\nI regard a knowledge of every detail of the original\r\nRobinson Crusoe as well-nigh a necessity in education.\r\nGirls  may occasionally be excused, but never boys.  It\r\nought to be unnecessary, therefore, to say that some of\r\nthe narrative passages of Crusoe in New York are taken,\r\nword for word, from the text of Defoe.  If I do state\r\nthis for the benefit of a few unfortunate ladies who are\r\nnot familiar with that text, it is because I think no one\r\namong many courteous critics has observed it.\r\n\r\n\"The Survivor's Story\" is one of eight short stories\r\nwhich were published in the first Christmas number of\r\n\"Old and New.\"\r\n\r\nOf the other stories I think no explanation is\r\nneeded, but such as was given at the time of their\r\npublication and is reprinted with each of them here.\r\n\r\nEDWARD E. HALE.\r\nROXBURY, July 6, 1899.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BRICK MOON\r\nCRUSOE IN NEW YORK\r\nBREAD ON THE WATERS\r\nTHE LOST PALACE\r\n99 LINWOOD STREET\r\nIDEALS\r\nTHANKSGIVING AT THE POLLS\r\nTHE SURVIVOR'S STORY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BRICK MOON\r\n\r\n[From the papers of Captain FREDERIC INGHAM.]\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nPREPARATION\r\n\r\nI have no sort of objection now to telling the whole\r\nstory.  The subscribers, of course, have a right to\r\nknow what became of their money.  The astronomers may\r\nas well know all about it, before they announce any\r\nmore asteroids with an enormous movement in\r\ndeclination.  And experimenters on the longitude may as\r\nwell know, so that they may act advisedly in attempting\r\nanother brick moon or in refusing to do so.\r\n\r\nIt all began more than thirty years ago, when we were\r\nin college; as most good things begin.  We were studying\r\nin the book which has gray sides and a green back, and is\r\ncalled \"Cambridge Astronomy\" because it is translated\r\nfrom the French.  We came across this business of the\r\nlongitude, and, as we talked, in the gloom and glamour of\r\nthe old South Middle dining-hall, we had going the usual\r\nnumber of students' stories about rewards offered by the\r\nBoard of Longitude for discoveries in that matter,--\r\nstories, all of which, so far as I know, are lies.  Like\r\nall boys, we had tried our hands at perpetual motion.\r\nFor me, I was sure I could square the circle, if they\r\nwould give me chalk enough.  But as to this business of\r\nthe longitude, it was reserved for Q.[1] to make the\r\nhappy hit and to explain it to the rest of us.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]  Wherever Q. is referred to in these pages my\r\nbrother Nathan is meant.  One of his noms de plume\r\nwas Gnat Q. Hale, because G and Q may be silent letters.\r\n\r\n\r\nI wonder if I can explain it to an unlearned world,\r\nwhich has not studied the book with gray sides and a\r\ngreen cambric back.  Let us try.\r\n\r\nYou know then, dear world, that when you look at the\r\nNorth Star, it always appears to you at just the same\r\nheight above the horizon or what is between you and the\r\nhorizon: say the Dwight School-house, or the houses in\r\nConcord Street; or to me, just now, North College.  You\r\nknow also that, if you were to travel to the North Pole,\r\nthe North Star would be just over your head.  And, if you\r\nwere to travel to the equator, it would be just on your\r\nhorizon, if you could see it at all through the red,\r\ndusty, hazy mist in the north, as you could not.  If you\r\nwere just half-way between pole and equator, on the line\r\nbetween us and Canada, the North Star would be half-way\r\nup, or 45@ from the horizon.  So you would know there\r\nthat you were 45@ from the equator.  Then in Boston, you\r\nwould find it was 42@ 20' from the horizon.  So you know\r\nthere that you are 42@ 20' from the equator.  At Seattle\r\nagain you would find it was 47@ 40' high, so our friends\r\nat Seattle know that they are at 47@ 40' from the\r\nequator.  The latitude of a place, in other words, is\r\nfound very easily by any observation which shows how high\r\nthe North Star is; if you do not want to measure the\r\nNorth Star, you may take any star when it is just to\r\nnorth of you, and measure its height; wait twelve hours,\r\nand if you can find it, measure its height again.  Split\r\nthe difference, and that is the altitude of the pole, or\r\nthe latitude of you, the observer.\r\n\r\n\"Of course we know this,\" says the graduating world.\r\n\"Do you suppose that is what we borrow your book for, to\r\nhave you spell out your miserable elementary astronomy?\"\r\nAt which rebuff I should shrink distressed, but that a\r\nchorus of voices an octave higher comes up with, \"Dear\r\nMr. Ingham, we are ever so much obliged to you; we did\r\nnot know it at all before, and you make it perfectly\r\nclear.\"\r\n\r\nThank you, my dear, and you, and you.  We will not\r\ncare what the others say.  If you do understand it, or do\r\nknow it, it is more than Mr. Charles Reade knew, or he\r\nwould not have made his two lovers on the island guess at\r\ntheir latitude, as they did.  If they had either of them\r\nbeen educated at a respectable academy for the Middle\r\nClasses, they would have fared better.\r\n\r\nNow about the longitude.\r\n\r\nThe latitude, which you have found, measures your\r\ndistance north or south from the equator or the pole.  To\r\nfind your longitude, you want to find your distance\r\neast or west from the meridian of Greenwich.  Now, if any\r\none would build a good tall tower at Greenwich, straight\r\ninto the sky,--say a hundred miles into the sky,--of\r\ncourse if you and I were east or west of it, and could\r\nsee it, we could tell how far east or west we were by\r\nmeasuring the apparent height of the tower above our\r\nhorizon.  If we could see so far, when the lantern with\r\na Drummond's light, \"ever so bright,\" on the very top of\r\nthe tower, appeared to be on our horizon, we should know\r\nwe were eight hundred and seventy-three miles away from\r\nit. The top of the tower would answer for us as the North\r\nStar does when we are measuring the latitude.  If we were\r\nnearer, our horizon would make a longer angle with the\r\nline from the top to our place of vision.  If we were\r\nfarther away, we should need a higher tower.\r\n\r\nBut nobody will build any such tower at Greenwich, or\r\nelsewhere on that meridian, or on any meridian.  You see\r\nthat to be of use to the half the world nearest to it, it\r\nwould have to be so high that the diameter of the world\r\nwould seem nothing in proportion.  And then, for the\r\nother half of the world you would have to erect another\r\ntower as high on the other side.  It was this difficulty\r\nthat made Q. suggest the expedient of the Brick Moon.\r\n\r\nFor you see that if, by good luck, there were a ring\r\nlike Saturn's which stretched round the world, above\r\nGreenwich and the meridian of Greenwich, and if it would\r\nstay above Greenwich, turning with the world, any one\r\nwho wanted to measure his longitude or distance from\r\nGreenwich would look out of window and see how high this\r\nring was above his horizon.  At Greenwich it would be\r\nover his head exactly.  At New Orleans, which is quarter\r\nround the world from Greenwich, it would be just in his\r\nhorizon.  A little west of New Orleans you would begin to\r\nlook for the other half of the ring on the west instead\r\nof the east; and if you went a little west of the Feejee\r\nIslands the ring would be over your head again.  So if we\r\nonly had a ring like that, not round the equator of the\r\nworld,--as Saturn's ring is around Saturn,--but vertical\r\nto the plane of the equator, as the brass ring of an\r\nartificial globe goes, only far higher in proportion,--\r\n\"from that ring,\" said Q., pensively, \"we could calculate\r\nthe longitude.\"\r\n\r\nFailing that, after various propositions, he\r\nsuggested the Brick Moon.  The plan was this:  If from\r\nthe surface of the earth, by a gigantic peashooter, you\r\ncould shoot a pea upward from Greenwich, aimed northward\r\nas well as upward; if you drove it so fast and far that\r\nwhen its power of ascent was exhausted, and it began to\r\nfall, it should clear the earth, and pass outside the\r\nNorth Pole; if you had given it sufficient power to get\r\nit half round the earth without touching, that pea would\r\nclear the earth forever.  It would continue to rotate\r\nabove the North Pole, above the Feejee Island place,\r\nabove the South Pole and Greenwich, forever, with the\r\nimpulse with which it had first cleared our atmosphere\r\nand attraction.  If only we could see that pea as it\r\nrevolved in that convenient orbit, then we could measure\r\nthe longitude from that, as soon as we knew how high the\r\norbit was, as well as if it were the ring of Saturn.\r\n\r\n\"But a pea is so small!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Q., \"but we must make a large pea.\"  Then\r\nwe fell to work on plans for making the pea very large\r\nand very light.  Large,--that it might be seen far away\r\nby storm-tossed navigators: light,--that it might be the\r\neasier blown four thousand and odd miles into the air;\r\nlest it should fall on the heads of the Greenlanders or\r\nthe Patagonians; lest they should be injured and the\r\nworld lose its new moon.  But, of course, all this lath-\r\nand-plaster had to be given up.  For the motion through\r\nthe air would set fire to this moon just as it does to\r\nother aerolites, and all your lath-and-plaster would\r\ngather into a few white drops, which no Rosse telescope\r\neven could discern.  \"No,\" said Q. bravely, \"at the least\r\nit must be very substantial.  It must stand fire well,\r\nvery well.  Iron will not answer.  It must be brick; we\r\nmust have a Brick Moon.\"\r\n\r\nThen we had to calculate its size.  You can see, on\r\nthe old moon, an edifice two hundred feet long with any\r\nof the fine refractors of our day.  But no such\r\nrefractors as those can be carried by the poor little\r\nfishermen whom we wanted to befriend, the bones of whose\r\nships lie white on so many cliffs, their names\r\nunreported at any Lloyd's or by any Ross,\r\n\r\nThemselves the owners and their sons the crew.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, we did not want our moon two hundred\r\nand fifty thousand miles away, as the old moon is, which\r\nI will call the Thornbush moon, for distinction.  We did\r\nnot care how near it was, indeed, if it were only far\r\nenough away to be seen, in practice, from almost the\r\nwhole world.  There must be a little strip where they\r\ncould not see it from the surface, unless we threw it\r\ninfinitely high.  \"But they need not look from the\r\nsurface,\" said Q.; \"they might climb to the mast-head.\r\nAnd if they did not see it at all, they would know that\r\nthey were ninety degrees from the meridian.\"\r\n\r\nThis difficulty about what we call \"the strip,\"\r\nhowever, led to an improvement in the plan, which made it\r\nbetter in every way.  It was clear that even if \"the\r\nstrip\" were quite wide, the moon would have to be a good\r\nway off, and, in proportion, hard to see.  If, however,\r\nwe would satisfy ourselves with a moon four thousand\r\nmiles away, THAT could be seen on the earth's surface\r\nfor three or four thousand miles on each side; and twice\r\nthree thousand, or six thousand, is one fourth of the\r\nlargest circumference of the earth.  We did not dare have\r\nit nearer than four thousand miles, since even at that\r\ndistance it would be eclipsed three hours out of every\r\nnight; and we wanted it bright and distinct, and not of\r\nthat lurid, copper, eclipse color.  But at four\r\nthousand miles' distance the moon could be seen by a belt\r\nof observers six or eight thousand miles in diameter.\r\n\"Start, then, two moons,\"--this was my contribution to\r\nthe plan.  \"Suppose one over the meridian of Greenwich,\r\nand the other over that of New Orleans.  Take care that\r\nthere is a little difference in the radii of their\r\norbits, lest they `collide' some foul day.  Then, in most\r\nplaces, one or other, perhaps two will come in sight.  So\r\nmuch the less risk of clouds: and everywhere there may be\r\none, except when it is cloudy.  Neither need be more than\r\nfour thousand miles off; so much the larger and more\r\nbeautiful will they be.  If on the old Thornbush moon old\r\nHerschel with his reflector could see a town-house two\r\nhundred feet long, on the Brick Moon young Herschel will\r\nbe able to see a dab of mortar a foot and a half long, if\r\nhe wants to.  And people without the reflector, with\r\ntheir opera-glasses, will be able to see sufficiently\r\nwell.\"  And to this they agreed: that eventually there\r\nmust be two Brick Moons.  Indeed, it were better that\r\nthere should be four, as each must be below the horizon\r\nhalf the time.  That is only as many as Jupiter has.  But\r\nit was also agreed that we might begin with one.\r\n\r\nWhy we settled on two hundred feet of diameter I\r\nhardly know.  I think it was from the statement of dear\r\nJohn Farrar's about the impossibility of there being a\r\nstate house two hundred feet long not yet discovered, on\r\nthe sunny side of old Thornbush.  That, somehow, made\r\ntwo hundred our fixed point.  Besides, a moon of two\r\nhundred feet diameter did not seem quite unmanageable.\r\nYet it was evident that a smaller moon would be of no\r\nuse, unless we meant to have them near the world, when\r\nthere would be so many that they would be confusing, and\r\neclipsed most of the time.  And four thousand miles is a\r\ngood way off to see a moon even two hundred feet in\r\ndiameter.\r\n\r\nSmall though we made them on paper, these two-\r\nhundred-foot moons were still too much for us.  Of course\r\nwe meant to build them hollow.  But even if hollow there\r\nmust be some thickness, and the quantity of brick would\r\nat best be enormous.  Then, to get them up!  The pea-\r\nshooter, of course, was only an illustration.  It was\r\nlong after that time that Rodman and other guns sent iron\r\nballs five or six miles in distance,--say two miles, more\r\nor less, in height.\r\n\r\nIron is much heavier than hollow brick, but you can\r\nbuild no gun with a bore of two hundred feet now,--far\r\nless could you then.  No.\r\n\r\nQ. again suggested the method of shooting oft the\r\nmoon.  It was not to be by any of your sudden explosions.\r\nIt was to be done as all great things are done,--by the\r\ngradual and silent accumulation of power.  You all know\r\nthat a flywheel--heavy, very heavy on the circumference,\r\nlight, very light within it--was made to save up power,\r\nfrom the time when it was produced to the time when it\r\nwas wanted.  Yes?  Then, before we began even to\r\nbuild the moon, before we even began to make the brick,\r\nwe would build two gigantic fly-wheels, the diameter of\r\neach should be \"ever so great,\" the circumference heavy\r\nbeyond all precedent, and thundering strong, so that no\r\ntemptation might burst it.  They should revolve, their\r\nedges nearly touching, in opposite directions, for years,\r\nif it were necessary, to accumulate power, driven by some\r\nwaterfall now wasted to the world.  One should be a\r\nlittle heavier than the other.  When the Brick Moon was\r\nfinished, and all was ready, IT should be gently rolled\r\ndown a gigantic groove provided for it, till it lighted\r\non the edge of both wheels at the same instant.  Of\r\ncourse it would not rest there, not the ten-thousandth\r\npart of a second.  It would be snapped upward, as a drop\r\nof water from a grindstone.  Upward and upward; but the\r\nheavier wheel would have deflected it a little from the\r\nvertical.  Upward and northward it would rise, therefore,\r\ntill it had passed the axis of the world.  It would, of\r\ncourse, feel the world's attraction all the time, which\r\nwould bend its flight gently, but still it would leave\r\nthe world more and more behind.  Upward still, but now\r\nsouthward, till it had traversed more than one hundred\r\nand eighty degrees of a circle.  Little resistance,\r\nindeed, after it had cleared the forty or fifty miles of\r\nvisible atmosphere.  \"Now let it fall,\" said Q., inspired\r\nwith the vision.  \"Let it fall, and the sooner the\r\nbetter!  The curve it is now on will forever clear\r\nthe world; and over the meridian of that lonely\r\nwaterfall,--if only we have rightly adjusted the gigantic\r\nflies,--will forever revolve, in its obedient orbit,\r\nthe--\r\n\r\nBRICK MOON,\r\n\r\nthe blessing of all seamen,--as constant in all change\r\nas its older sister has been fickle, and the second\r\ncynosure of all lovers upon the waves, and of all girls\r\nleft behind them.\"  \"Amen,\" we cried, and then we sat in\r\nsilence till the clock struck ten; then shook each other\r\ngravely by the hand, and left the South Middle dining-\r\nhall.\r\n\r\nOf waterfalls there were plenty that we knew.\r\n\r\nFly-wheels could be built of oak and pine, and hooped\r\nwith iron.  Fly-wheels did not discourage us.\r\n\r\nBut brick?  One brick is, say, sixty-four cubic\r\ninches only.  This moon,--though we made it hollow,--\r\nsee,--it must take twelve million brick.\r\n\r\nThe brick alone will cost sixty thousand dollars!\r\n\r\n\r\nThe brick alone would cost sixty thousand dollars.\r\nThere the scheme of the Brick Moon hung, an airy vision,\r\nfor seventeen years,--the years that changed us from\r\nyoung men into men.  The brick alone, sixty thousand\r\ndollars!  For, to boys who have still left a few of their\r\ncollege bills unpaid, who cannot think of buying that\r\nlovely little Elzevir which Smith has for sale at\r\nauction, of which Smith does not dream of the value,\r\nsixty thousand dollars seems as intangible as sixty\r\nmillion sestertia.  Clarke, second, how much are sixty\r\nmillion sestertia stated in cowries?  How much in\r\ncurrency, gold being at 1.37 1/4?  Right; go up.  Stop,\r\nI forget myself!\r\n\r\nSo, to resume, the project of the Brick Moon hung in\r\nthe ideal, an airy vision, a vision as lovely and as\r\ndistant as the Brick Moon itself, at this calm moment of\r\nmidnight when I write, as it poises itself over the\r\nshoulder of Orion, in my southern horizon.  Stop!  I\r\nanticipate.  Let me keep--as we say in Beadle's Dime\r\nSeries--to the even current of my story.\r\n\r\nSeventeen years passed by, we were no longer boys,\r\nthough we felt so.  For myself, to this hour, I never\r\nenter board meeting, committee meeting, or synod, without\r\nthe queer question, what would happen should any one\r\ndiscover that this bearded man was only a big boy\r\ndisguised? that the frockcoat and the round hat are none\r\nof mine, and that, if I should be spurned from the\r\nassembly, as an interloper, a judicious public, learning\r\nall the facts, would give a verdict, \"Served him right.\"\r\nThis consideration helps me through many bored meetings\r\nwhich would be else so dismal.  What did my old copy\r\nsay?--\r\n\r\n\"Boards are made of wood, they are long and narrow.\"\r\n\r\nBut we do not get on!\r\n\r\nSeventeen years after, I say, or should have said,\r\ndear Orcutt entered my room at Naguadavick again.  I had\r\nnot seen him since the Commencement day when we\r\nparted at Cambridge.  He looked the same, and yet not the\r\nsame.  His smile was the same, his voice, his tender look\r\nof sympathy when I spoke to him of a great sorrow, his\r\nchildlike love of fun.  His waistband was different, his\r\npantaloons were different, his smooth chin was buried in\r\na full beard, and he weighed two hundred pounds if he\r\nweighed a gramme.  O, the good time we had, so like the\r\ntimes of old!  Those were happy days for me in\r\nNaguadavick.  At that moment my double was at work for me\r\nat a meeting of the publishing committee of the\r\nSandemanian Review, so I called Orcutt up to my own\r\nsnuggery, and we talked over old times; talked till tea\r\nwas ready.  Polly came up through the orchard and made\r\ntea for us herself there.  We talked on and on, till\r\nnine, ten at night, and then it was that dear Orcutt\r\nasked me if I remembered the Brick Moon.  Remember it? of\r\ncourse I did.  And without leaving my chair I opened the\r\ndrawer of my writing-desk, and handed him a portfolio\r\nfull of working-drawings on which I had engaged myself\r\nfor my \"third\"[1] all that winter.  Orcutt was delighted.\r\nHe turned them over hastily but intelligently, and said:\r\n\"I am so glad.  I could not think you had forgotten.  And\r\nI have seen Brannan, and Brannan has not forgotten.\"\r\n\"Now do you know,\" said he, \"in all this railroading of\r\nmine, I have not forgotten.  When I built the great\r\ntunnel for the Cattawissa and Opelousas, by which we\r\ngot rid of the old inclined planes, there was never a\r\nstone bigger than a peach-stone within two hundred miles\r\nof us.  I baked the brick of that tunnel on the line with\r\nmy own kilns.  Ingham, I have made more brick, I believe,\r\nthan any man living in the world!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]  \"Every man,\" says Dr. Peabody, \"should have a\r\nvocation and an avocation.\"  To which I add,\"A third.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"You are the providential man,\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"Am I not, Fred?  More than that,\" said he; \"I have\r\nsucceeded in things the world counts worth more than\r\nbrick.  I have made brick, and I have made money!\"\r\n\r\n\"One of us make money?\" asked I, amazed.\r\n\r\n\"Even so,\" said dear Orcutt; \"one of us has, made\r\nmoney.\"  And he proceeded to tell me how.  It was not in\r\nbuilding tunnels, nor in making brick.  No!  It was by\r\nbuying up the original stock of the Cattawissa and\r\nOpelousas, at a moment when that stock had hardly a\r\nnominal price in the market.  There were the first\r\nmortgage bonds, and the second mortgage bonds, and the\r\nthird, and I know not how much floating debt; and worse\r\nthan all, the reputation of the road lost, and deservedly\r\nlost.  Every locomotive it had was asthmatic.  Every car\r\nit had bore the marks of unprecedented accidents, for\r\nwhich no one was to blame.  Rival lines, I know not how\r\nmany, were cutting each other's throats for its\r\nlegitimate business.  At this juncture dear George\r\ninvested all his earnings as a contractor, in the\r\ndespised original stock,--he actually bought it for 3 1/4\r\nper cent,--good shares that had cost a round hundred\r\nto every wretch who had subscribed.  Six thousand eight\r\nhundred dollars--every cent he had--did George thus\r\ninvest.  Then he went himself to the trustees of the\r\nfirst mortgage, to the trustees of the second, and to the\r\ntrustees of the third, and told them what he had done.\r\n\r\nNow it is personal presence that moves the world.\r\nDear Orcutt has found that out since, if he did not know\r\nit before.  The trustees who would have sniffed had\r\nGeorge written to them, turned round from their desks,\r\nand begged him to take a chair, when he came to talk with\r\nthem.  Had he put every penny he was worth into that\r\nstock?  Then it was worth something which they did not\r\nknow of, for George Orcutt was no fool about railroads.\r\nThe man who bridged the Lower Rapidan when a freshet was\r\nrunning was no fool.\r\n\r\n\"What were his plans?\"\r\n\r\nGeorge did not tell--no, not to lordly trustees--what\r\nhis plans were.  He had plans, but he kept them to\r\nhimself.  All he told them was that he had plans.  On\r\nthose plans he had staked his all.  Now, would they or\r\nwould they not agree to put him in charge of the running\r\nof that road, for twelve months, on a nominal salary?\r\nThe superintendent they had had was a rascal.  He had\r\nproved that by running away.  They knew that George was\r\nnot a rascal.  He knew that he could make this road pay\r\nexpenses, pay bond-holders, and pay a dividend,--a thing\r\nno one else had dreamed of for twenty years.  Could\r\nthey do better than try him?\r\n\r\nOf course they could not, and they knew they could\r\nnot.  Of course they sniffed and talked, and waited, and\r\npretended they did not know, and that they must consult,\r\nand so forth and so on.  But of course they all did try\r\nhim, on his own terms.  He was put in charge of the\r\nrunning of that road.\r\n\r\nIn one week he showed he should redeem it.  In three\r\nmonths he did redeem it!\r\n\r\nHe advertised boldly the first day: \"Infant\r\nchildren at treble price.\"\r\n\r\nThe novelty attracted instant remark.  And it showed\r\nmany things.  First, it showed he was a humane man, who\r\nwished to save human life.  He would leave these\r\ninnocents in their cradles, where they belonged.\r\n\r\nSecond, and chiefly, the world of travellers saw that\r\nthe Crichton, the Amadis, the perfect chevalier of the\r\nfuture, had arisen,--a railroad manager caring for the\r\ncomfort of his passengers!\r\n\r\nThe first week the number of the C. and O.'s\r\npassengers was doubled: in a week or two more freight\r\nbegan to come in, in driblets, on the line which its\r\nowners had gone over.  As soon as the shops could turn\r\nthem out, some cars were put on, with arms on which\r\ntravellers could rest their elbows, with head-rests where\r\nthey could take naps if they were weary.  These excited\r\nso much curiosity that one was exhibited in the museum\r\nat Cattawissa and another at Opelousas.  It may not\r\nbe generally known that the received car of the American\r\nroads was devised to secure a premium offered by the\r\nPawtucket and Podunk Company.  Their receipts were\r\ngrowing so large that they feared they should forfeit\r\ntheir charter.  They advertised, therefore, for a car in\r\nwhich no man could sleep at night or rest by day,--in\r\nwhich the backs should be straight, the heads of\r\npassengers unsupported, the feet entangled in a vice, the\r\nelbows always knocked by the passing conductor.  The\r\npattern was produced which immediately came into use on\r\nall the American roads.  But on the Cattawissa and\r\nOpelousas this time-honored pattern was set aside.\r\n\r\nOf course you see the result.  Men went hundreds of\r\nmiles out of their way to ride on the C. and O.  The\r\nthird mortgage was paid off; a reserve fund was piled up\r\nfor the second; the trustees of the first lived in dread\r\nof being paid; and George's stock, which he bought at 3\r\n1/4, rose to 147 before two years had gone by!  So was it\r\nthat, as we sat together in the snuggery, George was\r\nworth well-nigh three hundred thousand dollars.  Some of\r\nhis eggs were in the basket where they were laid; some he\r\nhad taken out and placed in other baskets; some in nests\r\nwhere various hens were brooding over them.  Sound eggs\r\nthey were, wherever placed; and such was the victory of\r\nwhich George had come to tell.\r\n\r\nOne of us had made money!\r\n\r\nOn his way he had seen Brannan.  Brannan, the pure-\r\nminded, right-minded, shifty man of tact, man of brain,\r\nman of heart, and man of word, who held New Altona in the\r\nhollow of his hand.  Brannan had made no money.  Not he,\r\nnor ever will.  But Brannan could do much what he pleased\r\nin this world, without money.  For whenever Brannan\r\nstudied the rights and the wrongs of any enterprise, all\r\nmen knew that what Brannan decided about it was well-nigh\r\nthe eternal truth; and therefore all men of sense were\r\naccustomed to place great confidence in his prophecies.\r\nBut, more than this, and better, Brannan was an\r\nunconscious dog, who believed in the people.  So, when he\r\nknew what was the right and what was the wrong, he could\r\nstand up before two or three thousand people and tell\r\nthem what was right and what was wrong, and tell them\r\nwith the same simplicity and freshness with which he\r\nwould talk to little Horace on his knee.  Of the\r\nthousands who heard him there would not be one in a\r\nhundred who knew that this was eloquence.  They were fain\r\nto say, as they sat in their shops, talking, that Brannan\r\nwas not eloquent.  Nay, they went so far as to regret\r\nthat Brannan was not eloquent!  If he were only as\r\neloquent as Carker was or as Barker was, how excellent he\r\nwould be!  But when, a month after, it was necessary for\r\nthem to do anything about the thing he had been speaking\r\nof, they did what Brannan had told them to do;\r\nforgetting, most likely, that he had ever told them,\r\nand fancying that these were their own ideas, which, in\r\nfact, had, from his liquid, ponderous, transparent, and\r\ninvisible common sense, distilled unconsciously into\r\ntheir being.  I wonder whether Brannan ever knew that he\r\nwas eloquent.  What I knew, and what dear George knew,\r\nwas, that he was one of the leaders of men!\r\n\r\nCourage, my friends, we are steadily advancing to the\r\nBrick Moon!\r\n\r\nFor George had stopped, and seen Brannan; and Brannan\r\nhad not forgotten.  Seventeen years Brannan had\r\nremembered, and not a ship had been lost on a lee-shore\r\nbecause her longitude was wrong,--not a baby had wailed\r\nits last as it was ground between wrecked spar and cruel\r\nrock,--not a swollen corpse unknown had been flung up\r\nupon the sand and been buried with a nameless epitaph,--\r\nbut Brannan had recollected the Brick Moon, and had, in\r\nthe memory-chamber which rejected nothing, stored away\r\nthe story of the horror.  And now George was ready to\r\nconsecrate a round hundred thousand to the building of\r\nthe Moon; and Brannan was ready, in the thousand ways in\r\nwhich wise men move the people to and fro, to persuade\r\nthem to give to us a hundred thousand more; and George\r\nhad come to ask me if I were not ready to undertake with\r\nthem the final great effort, of which our old\r\ncalculations were the embryo.  For this I was now to\r\ncontribute the mathematical certainty and the lore\r\nborrowed from naval science, which should blossom and\r\nbear fruit when the Brick Moon was snapped like a cherry\r\nfrom the ways on which it was built, was launched into\r\nthe air by power gathered from a thousand freshets, and,\r\npoised at last in its own pre-calculated region of the\r\nether, should begin its course of eternal blessings in\r\none unchanging meridian!\r\n\r\nVision of Beneficence and Wonder!  Of course I\r\nconsented.\r\n\r\nOh that you were not so eager for the end!  Oh that\r\nI might tell you, what now you will never know,--of the\r\ngreat campaign which we then and there inaugurated!  How\r\nthe horrible loss of the Royal Martyr, whose longitude\r\nwas three degrees awry, startled the whole world, and\r\ngave us a point to start from.  How I explained to George\r\nthat he must not subscribe the one hundred thousand\r\ndollars in a moment.  It must come in bits, when \"the\r\ncause\" needed a  stimulus, or the public needed\r\nencouragement.  How we caught neophyte editors, and\r\nexplained to them enough to make them think the Moon was\r\nwell-nigh their own invention and their own thunder.\r\nHow, beginning in Boston, we sent round to all the men of\r\nscience, all those of philanthropy, and all those of\r\ncommerce, three thousand circulars, inviting them to a\r\nprivate meeting at George's parlors at the Revere.  How,\r\nbesides ourselves, and some nice, respectable-looking old\r\ngentlemen Brannan had brought over from Podunk with him,\r\npaying their fares both ways, there were present only\r\nthree men,--all adventurers whose projects had failed,--\r\nbesides the representatives of the press.  How, of these\r\nrepresentatives, some understood the whole, and some\r\nunderstood nothing.  How, the next day, all gave us\r\n\"first-rate notices.\"  How, a few days after, in the\r\nlower Horticultural Hall, we had our first public\r\nmeeting.  How Haliburton brought us fifty people who\r\nloved him,--his Bible class, most of them,--to help fill\r\nup; how, besides these, there were not three persons whom\r\nwe had not asked personally, or one who could invent an\r\nexcuse to stay away.  How we had hung the walls with\r\nintelligible and unintelligible diagrams.  How I opened\r\nthe meeting.  Of that meeting, indeed, I must tell\r\nsomething.\r\n\r\nFirst, I spoke.  I did not pretend to unfold the\r\nscheme.  I did not attempt any rhetoric.  But I did not\r\nmake any apologies.  I told them simply of the dangers of\r\nlee-shores.  I told them when they were most dangerous,--\r\nwhen seamen came upon them unawares.  I explained to them\r\nthat, though the costly chronometer, frequently adjusted,\r\nmade a delusive guide to the voyager who often made a\r\nharbor, still the adjustment was treacherous, the\r\ninstrument beyond the use of the poor, and that, once\r\nastray, its error increased forever.  I said that we\r\nbelieved we had a method which, if the means were\r\nsupplied for the experiment, would give the humblest\r\nfisherman the very certainty of sunrise and of sunset in\r\nhis calculations of his place upon the world.  And I said\r\nthat whenever a man knew his place in this world, it\r\nwas always likely all would go well.  Then I sat down.\r\n\r\nThen dear George spoke,--simply, but very briefly.\r\nHe said he was a stranger to the Boston people, and that\r\nthose who knew him at all knew he was not a talking man.\r\nHe was a civil engineer, and his business was to\r\ncalculate and to build, and not to talk.  But he had come\r\nhere to say that he had studied this new plan for the\r\nlongitude from the Top to the Bottom, and that he\r\nbelieved in it through and through.  There was his\r\nopinion, if that was worth anything to anybody.  If that\r\nmeeting resolved to go forward with the enterprise, or if\r\nanybody proposed to, he should offer his services in any\r\ncapacity, and without any pay, for its success.  If he\r\nmight only work as a bricklayer, he would work as a\r\nbricklayer.  For he believed, on his soul, that the\r\nsuccess of this enterprise promised more for mankind than\r\nany enterprise which was ever likely to call for the\r\ndevotion of his life.  \"And to the good of mankind,\" he\r\nsaid, very simply, \"my life is devoted.\"  Then he sat\r\ndown.\r\n\r\nThen Brannan got up.  Up to this time, excepting that\r\nGeorge had dropped this hint about bricklaying, nobody\r\nhad said a word about the Moon, far less hinted what it\r\nwas to be made of.  So Ben had the whole to open.  He did\r\nit as if he had been talking to a bright boy of ten years\r\nold.  He made those people think that he respected\r\nthem as his equals.  But, in fact, he chose every\r\nword, as if not one of them knew anything.  He explained,\r\nas if it were rather more simple to explain than to take\r\nfor granted.  But he explained as if, were they talking,\r\nthey might be explaining to him.  He led them from point\r\nto point,--oh! so much more clearly than I have been\r\nleading you,--till, as their mouths dropped a little open\r\nin their eager interest, and their lids forgot to wink in\r\ntheir gaze upon his face, and so their eyebrows seemed a\r\nlittle lifted in curiosity,--till, I say, each man felt\r\nas if he were himself the inventor, who had bridged\r\ndifficulty after difficulty; as if, indeed, the whole\r\nwere too simple to be called difficult or complicated.\r\nThe only wonder was that the Board of Longitude, or the\r\nEmperor Napoleon, or the Smithsonian, or somebody, had\r\nnot sent this little planet on its voyage of blessing\r\nlong before.  Not a syllable that you would have called\r\nrhetoric, not a word that you would have thought\r\nprepared; and then Brannan sat down.\r\n\r\nThat was Ben Brannan's way.  For my part, I like it\r\nbetter than eloquence.\r\n\r\nThen I got up again.  We would answer any questions,\r\nI said.  We represented people who were eager to go\r\nforward with this work. (Alas! except Q., all of those\r\nrepresented were on the stage.)  We could not go forward\r\nwithout the general assistance of the community.  It was\r\nnot an enterprise which the government could be asked to\r\nfavor.  It was not an enterprise which would yield\r\none penny of profit to any human being.  We had\r\ntherefore, purely on the ground of its benefit to\r\nmankind, brought it before an assembly of Boston men and\r\nwomen.\r\n\r\nThen there was a pause, and we could hear our watches\r\ntick, and our hearts beat.  Dear George asked me in a\r\nwhisper if he should say anything more, but I thought\r\nnot.  The pause became painful, and then Tom Coram,\r\nprince of merchants, rose.  Had any calculation been made\r\nof the probable cost of the experiment of one moon?\r\n\r\nI said the calculations were on the table.  The brick\r\nalone would cost $60,000.  Mr. Orcutt had computed that\r\n$214,729 would complete two flywheels and one moon.  This\r\nmade no allowance for whitewashing the moon, which was\r\nnot strictly necessary.  The fly-wheels and water-power\r\nwould be equally valuable for the succeeding moons, it\r\nany were attempted, and therefore the second moon could\r\nbe turned off, it was hoped, for $159,732.\r\n\r\nThomas Coram had been standing all the time I spoke,\r\nand in an instant he said:  \"I am no mathematician.  But\r\nI have had a ship ground to pieces under me on the\r\nLaccadives because our chronometer was wrong.  You need\r\n$250,000 to build your first moon.  I will be one of\r\ntwenty men to furnish the money; or I will pay  $10,000\r\nto-morrow for this purpose, to any person who may be\r\nnamed as treasurer, to be repaid to me if the moon is not\r\nfinished this day twenty years.\"\r\n\r\nThat was as long a speech as Tom Coram ever made.\r\nBut it was pointed.  The small audience tapped applause.\r\n\r\nOrcutt looked at me, and I nodded.  \"I will be\r\nanother, of the twenty men,\" cried he.  \"And I another,\"\r\nsaid an old bluff Englishman, whom nobody had invited;\r\nwho proved to be a Mr. Robert Boll, a Sheffield man, who\r\ncame in from curiosity.  He stopped after the meeting;\r\nsaid he should leave the country the next week, and I\r\nhave never seen him since.  But his bill of exchange came\r\nall the same.\r\n\r\nThat was all the public subscribing.  Enough more\r\nthan we had hoped for.  We tried to make Coram treasurer,\r\nbut he refused.  We had to make Haliburton treasurer,\r\nthough we should have liked a man better known than he\r\nthen was.  Then we adjourned.  Some nice ladies then came\r\nup, and gave, one a dollar, and one five dollars, and one\r\nfifty, and so on,--and some men who have stuck by ever\r\nsince.  I always, in my own mind, call each of those\r\nwomen Damaris, and each of those men Dionysius.  But\r\nthose are not their real names.\r\n\r\nHow I am wasting time on an old story!  Then some of\r\nthese ladies came the next day and proposed a fair; and\r\nout of that, six months after, grew the great Longitude\r\nFair, that you will all remember, if you went to it, I am\r\nsure.  And the papers the next day gave us first-rate\r\nreports; and then, two by two, with our subscription-\r\nbooks, we went at it.  But I must not tell the details of\r\nthat subscription.  There were two or three men who\r\nsubscribed $5,000 each, because they were perfectly\r\ncertain the amount would never be raised.  They wanted,\r\nfor once, to get the credit of liberality for nothing.\r\nThere were many men and many women who subscribed from\r\none dollar up to one thousand, not because they cared a\r\nstraw for the longitude, nor because they believed in the\r\nleast in the project; but because they believed in\r\nBrannan, in Orcutt, in Q., or in me.  Love goes far in\r\nthis world of ours.  Some few men subscribed because\r\nothers had done it: it was the thing to do, and they must\r\nnot be out of fashion.  And three or four, at least,\r\nsubscribed because each hour of their lives there came up\r\nthe memory of the day when the news came that the---- was\r\nlost, George, or Harry, or John, in the----, and they\r\nknew that George, or Harry, or John might have been at\r\nhome, had it been easier than it is to read the courses\r\nof the stars!\r\n\r\nFair, subscriptions, and Orcutt's reserve,--we\r\ncounted up $162,000, or nearly so.  There would be a\r\nlittle more when all was paid in.\r\n\r\nBut we could not use a cent, except Orcutt's and our\r\nown little subscriptions, till we had got the whole.  And\r\nat this point it seemed as if the whole world was sick of\r\nus, and that we had gathered every penny that was in\r\nstore for us.  The orange was squeezed dry!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nHOW WE BUILT IT\r\n\r\nThe orange was squeezed dry!  And how little any of us\r\nknew,--skilful George Orcutt, thoughtful Ben Brannan,\r\nloyal Haliburton, ingenious Q., or poor painstaking\r\nI,--how little we knew, or any of us, where was another\r\norange, or how we could mix malic acid and tartaric\r\nacid, and citric acid and auric acid and sugar and\r\nwater so as to imitate orange-juice, and fill up the\r\nbank-account enough to draw in the conditioned\r\nsubscriptions, and so begin to build the MOON.  How\r\noften, as I lay awake at night, have I added up the\r\ndifferent subscriptions in some new order, as if that\r\nwould help the matter: and how steadily they have come\r\nout one hundred and sixty-two thousand dollars, or even\r\nless, when I must needs, in my sleepiness, forget\r\nsomebody's name!  So Haliburton put into railroad\r\nstocks all the money he collected, and the rest of us\r\nground on at our mills, or flew up on our own wings\r\ntowards Heaven.  Thus Orcutt built more tunnels, Q.\r\nprepared for more commencements, Haliburton calculated\r\nmore policies, Ben Brannan created more civilization,\r\nand I, as I could, healed the hurt of my people of\r\nNaguadavick for the months there were left to me of my\r\nstay in that thriving town.\r\n\r\nNone of us had the wit to see how the problem was to\r\nbe wrought out further.  No.  The best things come to us\r\nwhen we have faithfully and well made all the\r\npreparation and done our best; but they come in some way\r\nthat is none of ours.  So was it now, that to build the\r\nBRICK MOON it was necessary that I should be turned out\r\nof Naguadavick ignominiously, and that Jeff. Davis and\r\nsome seven or eight other bad men should create the Great\r\nRebellion.  Hear how it happened.\r\n\r\nDennis Shea, my Double,--otherwise, indeed, called by\r\nmy name and legally so,--undid me, as my friends\r\nsupposed, one evening at a public meeting called by poor\r\nIsaacs in Naguadavick.  Of that transaction I have no\r\noccasion here to tell the story.  But of that transaction\r\none consequence is that the BRICK MOON now moves in\r\nether.  I stop writing, to rest my eye upon it, through\r\na little telescope of Alvan Clark's here, which is always\r\ntrained near it.  It is moving on as placidly as ever.\r\n\r\nIt came about thus.  The morning after poor Dennis,\r\nwhom I have long since forgiven, made his extraordinary\r\nspeeches, without any authority from me, in the Town Hall\r\nat Naguadavick, I thought, and my wife agreed with me,\r\nthat we had better both leave town with the children.\r\nAuchmuty, our dear friend, thought so too.  We left in\r\nthe seven o'clock Accommodation for Skowhegan, and so\r\ncame to Township No. 9 in the 3d Range, and there for\r\nyears we resided.  That whole range of townships was set\r\noff under a provision admirable in its character, that\r\nthe first settled minister in each town should receive\r\none hundred acres of land as the \"minister's grant,\"\r\nand the first settled schoolmaster eighty.  To No. 9,\r\ntherefore, I came.  I constituted a little Sandemanian\r\nchurch.  Auchmuty and Delafield came up and installed me,\r\nand with these hands I built the cabin in which, with\r\nPolly and the little ones, I have since spent many happy\r\nnights and days.  This is not the place for me to publish\r\na map, which I have by me, of No. 9, nor an account of\r\nits many advantages for settlers.  Should I ever print my\r\npapers called \"Stay-at-home Robinsons,\" it will be easy\r\nwith them to explain its topography and geography.\r\nSuffice it now to say, that, with Alice and Bertha and\r\nPolly, I took tramps up and down through the lumbermen's\r\nroads, and soon knew the general features of the lay of\r\nthe land.  Nor was it long, of course, before we came out\r\none day upon the curious land-slides, which have more\r\nthan once averted the flow of the Little Carrotook River,\r\nwhere it has washed the rocks away so far as to let down\r\none section more of the overlying yielding yellow clay.\r\n\r\nThink how my eyes flashed, and my wife's, as,\r\nstruggling though a wilderness of moosewood, we came out\r\none afternoon on this front of yellow clay!  Yellow clay\r\nof course, when properly treated by fire, is brick!  Here\r\nwe were surrounded by forests, only waiting to be burned;\r\nyonder was clay, only waiting to be baked.  Polly looked\r\nat me, and I looked at her, and with one voice, we cried\r\nout, \"The MOON!\"\r\n\r\nFor here was this shouting river at our feet, whose\r\npower had been running to waste since the day when the\r\nLaurentian hills first heaved themselves above the hot\r\nAtlantic; and that day, I am informed by Mr. Agassiz, was\r\nthe first day in the history of this solid world.  Here\r\nwas water-power enough for forty fly-wheels, were it\r\nnecessary to send heavenward twenty moons.  Here was\r\nsolid timber enough for a hundred dams, yet only one was\r\nnecessary to give motion to the fly-wheels.  Here was\r\nretirement,--freedom from criticism, an escape from the\r\njournalists, who would not embarrass us by telling of\r\nevery cracked brick which had to be rejected from the\r\nstructure.  We had lived in No. 9 now for six weeks, and\r\nnot an \"own correspondent\" of them all had yet told what\r\nRev. Mr. Ingham had for dinner.\r\n\r\nOf course I wrote to George Orcutt at once of our\r\ngreat discovery, and he came up at once to examine the\r\nsituation.  On the whole, it pleased him.  He could not\r\ntake the site I proposed for the dam, because this very\r\nclay there made the channel treacherous, and there was\r\ndanger that the stream would work out a new career.  But\r\nlower down we found a stony gorge with which George was\r\nsatisfied; he traced out a line for a railway by which,\r\nof their own weight, the brick-cars could run to the\r\ncentrings; he showed us where, with some excavations, the\r\nfly-wheels could be placed exactly above the great mill-\r\nwheels, that no power might be wasted, and explained to\r\nus how, when the gigantic structure was finished, the\r\nBRICK MOON would gently roll down its ways upon the rapid\r\nwheels, to be launched instant into the sky!\r\n\r\nShall I ever forget that happy October day of\r\nanticipation?\r\n\r\nWe spent many of those October days in tentative\r\nsurveys.  Alice and Bertha were our chain-men,\r\nintelligent and obedient.  I drove for George his stakes,\r\nor I cut away his brush, or I raised and lowered the\r\nshield at which he sighted  and at noon Polly appeared\r\nwith her baskets, and we would dine al fresco, on a\r\npretty point which, not many months after, was wholly\r\ncovered by the eastern end of the dam.  When the field-\r\nwork was finished we retired to the cabin for days, and\r\ncalculated and drew, and drew and calculated.  Estimates\r\nfor feeding Irishmen, estimates of hay for mules,--George\r\nwas sure he could work mules better than oxen,--estimates\r\nfor cement, estimates for the preliminary saw-mills,\r\nestimates for rail for the little brick-road, for wheels,\r\nfor spikes, and for cutting ties; what did we not\r\nestimate for--on a basis almost wholly new, you will\r\nobserve.  For here the brick would cost us less than our\r\nold conceptions,--our water-power cost us almost\r\nnothing,--but our stores and our wages would cost us much\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nThese estimates are now to me very curious,--a\r\nmonument, indeed, to dear George's memory, that in the\r\nresult they proved so accurate.  I would gladly print\r\nthem here at length, with some illustrative cuts, but\r\nthat I know the impatience of the public, and its\r\nindifference to detail.  If we are ever able to print a\r\nproper memorial of George, that, perhaps, will be the\r\nfitter place for them.  Suffice it to say that with the\r\nsubtractions thus made from the original estimates,--even\r\nwith the additions forced upon us by working in a\r\nwilderness,--George was satisfied that a money charge of\r\n$197,327 would build and start THE MOON.  As soon as we\r\nhad determined the site, we marked off eighty acres,\r\nwhich contained all the essential localities, up and down\r\nthe little Carrotook River,--I engaged George for the\r\nfirst schoolmaster in No. 9, and he took these eighty\r\nacres for the schoolmaster's reservation.  Alice and\r\nBertha went to school to him the next day, taking lessons\r\nin civil engineering; and I wrote to the Bingham trustees\r\nto notify them that I had engaged a teacher, and that he\r\nhad selected his land.\r\n\r\nOf course we remembered, still, that we were near\r\nforty thousand dollars short of the new estimates, and\r\nalso that much of our money would not be paid us but on\r\ncondition that two hundred and fifty thousand were\r\nraised.  But George said that his own subscription was\r\nwholly unhampered: with that we would go to work on the\r\npreliminary work of the dam, and on the flies.  Then, if\r\nthe flies would hold together,--and they should hold if\r\nmortise and iron could hold them,--they might be at\r\nwork summers and winters, days and nights, storing up\r\nPower for us.  This would encourage the subscribers, it\r\nwould encourage us; and all this preliminary work would\r\nbe out of the way when we were really ready to begin upon\r\nthe MOON.\r\n\r\nBrannan, Haliburton, and Q. readily agreed to this\r\nwhen they were consulted.  They were the other trustees\r\nunder an instrument which we had got St. Leger[1] to draw\r\nup.  George gave up, as soon as he might, his other\r\nappointments; and taught me, meanwhile, where and how I\r\nwas to rig a little saw-mill, to cut some necessary\r\nlumber.  I engaged a gang of men to cut the timber for\r\nthe dam, and to have it ready; and, with the next spring,\r\nwe were well at work on the dam and on the flies!  These\r\nneeded, of course, the most solid foundation.  The least\r\nirregularity of their movement might send the MOON awry.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]  The St. Leger of these stories was Francis Brown\r\nHayes, H. C. 1839.\r\n\r\n\r\nAh me! would I not gladly tell the history of every\r\nbar of iron which was bent into the tires of those flies,\r\nand of every log which was mortised into its place in the\r\ndam, nay, of every curling mass of foam which played in\r\nthe eddies beneath, when the dam was finished, and the\r\nwaste water ran so smoothly over?  Alas! that one drop\r\nshould be wasted of water that might move a world,\r\nalthough a small one!  I almost dare say that I remember\r\neach and all these,--with such hope and happiness did I\r\nlend myself, as I could, each day to the great\r\nenterprise; lending to dear George, who was here and\r\nthere and everywhere, and was this and that and\r\neverybody,--lending to him, I say, such poor help as I\r\ncould lend, in whatever way.  We waked, in the two cabins\r\nin those happy days, just before the sun came up, when\r\nthe birds were in their loudest clamor of morning joy.\r\nWrapped each in a blanket, George and I stepped out from\r\nour doors, each trying to call the other, and often\r\nmeeting on the grass between.  We ran to the river and\r\nplunged in,--oh, how cold it was!--laughed and screamed\r\nlike boys, rubbed ourselves aglow, and ran home to build\r\nPolly's fire beneath the open chimney which stood beside\r\nmy cabin.  The bread had risen in the night.  The water\r\nsoon boiled above the logs.  The children came laughing\r\nout upon the grass, barefoot, and fearless of the dew.\r\nThen Polly appeared with her gridiron and bear-steak, or\r\nwith her griddle and eggs, and, in fewer minutes than\r\nthis page has cost me, the breakfast was ready for Alice\r\nto carry, dish by dish, to the white-clad table on the\r\npiazza.  Not Raphael and Adam more enjoyed their\r\nwatermelons, fox-grapes, and late blueberries!  And, in\r\nthe long croon of the breakfast, we revenged ourselves\r\nfor the haste with which it had been prepared.\r\n\r\nWhen we were well at table, a horn from the cabins\r\nbelow sounded the reveille for the drowsier workmen.\r\nSoon above the larches rose the blue of their smokes; and\r\nwhen we were at last nodding to the children, to say\r\nthat they might leave the table, and Polly was folding\r\nher napkin as to say she wished we were gone, we would\r\nsee tall Asaph Langdon, then foreman of the carpenters,\r\nsauntering up the valley with a roll of paper, or an\r\nadze, or a shingle with some calculations on it,--with\r\nsomething on which he wanted Mr. Orcutt's directions for\r\nthe day.\r\n\r\nAn hour of nothings set the carnal machinery of the\r\nday agoing.  We fed the horses, the cows, the pigs, and\r\nthe hens.  We collected the eggs and cleaned the hen-\r\nhouses and the barns.  We brought in wood enough for the\r\nday's fire, and water enough for the day's cooking and\r\ncleanliness.  These heads describe what I and the\r\nchildren did.  Polly's life during that hour was more\r\nmysterious.  That great first hour of the day is devoted\r\nwith women to the deepest arcana of the Eleusinian\r\nmysteries of the divine science of housekeeping.  She who\r\ncan meet the requisitions of that hour wisely and bravely\r\nconquers in the Day's Battle.  But what she does in it,\r\nlet no man try to say!  It can be named, but not\r\ndescribed, in the comprehensive formula, \"Just stepping\r\nround.\"\r\n\r\nThat hour well given to chores and to digestion, the\r\nchildren went to Mr. Orcutt's open-air school, and I to\r\nmy rustic study,--a separate cabin, with a rough square\r\ntable in it, and some book-boxes equally rude.  No man\r\nentered it, excepting George and me.  Here for two hours\r\nI worked undisturbed,--how happy the world, had it\r\nneither postman nor door-bell!--worked upon my Traces of\r\nSandemanianism in the Sixth and Seventh Centuries, and\r\nthen was ready to render such service to The Cause and to\r\nGeorge as the day might demand.  Thus I rode to Lincoln\r\nor to Foxcroft to order supplies; I took my gun and lay\r\nin wait on Chairback for a bear; I transferred to the\r\nhewn lumber the angles or bevels from the careful\r\ndrawings: as best I could, I filled an apostle's part,\r\nand became all things to all these men around me.  Happy\r\nthose days!--and thus the dam was built; in such Arcadian\r\nsimplicity was reared the mighty wheel; thus grew on each\r\nside the towers which were to support the flies; and\r\nthus, to our delight not unmixed with wonder, at last we\r\nsaw those mighty flies begin to turn.  Not in one day,\r\nnor in ten; but in a year or two of happy life,--full of\r\nthe joy of joys,--the \"joy of eventful living.\"\r\n\r\nYet, for all this, $162,000 was not $197,000, far\r\nless was it $250,000; and but for Jeff. Davis and his\r\ncrew the BRICK MOON would not have been born.\r\n\r\nBut at last Jeff. Davis was ready.  \"My preparations\r\nbeing completed,\" wrote General Beauregard, \"I opened\r\nfire on Fort Sumter.\"  Little did he know it,--but in\r\nthat explosion the BRICK MOON also was lifted into the\r\nsky!\r\n\r\nLittle did we know it, when, four weeks after, George\r\ncame up from the settlements, all excited with the\r\nnews!  The wheels had been turning now for four days,\r\nfaster of course and faster.  George had gone down for\r\nmoney to pay off the men, and he brought us up the news\r\nthat the Rebellion had begun.\r\n\r\n\"The last of this happy life,\" he said; \"the last,\r\nalas, of our dear MOON.\"  How little he knew and we!\r\n\r\nBut he paid off the men, and they packed their traps\r\nand disappeared, and, before two months were over, were\r\nin the lines before the enemy.  George packed up, bade us\r\nsadly good-by, and before a week had offered his service\r\nto Governor Fenton in Albany.  For us, it took rather\r\nlonger; but we were soon packed; Polly took the children\r\nto her sister's, and I went on to the Department to offer\r\nmy service there.  No sign of life left in No. 9, but the\r\ntwo gigantic Fly-Wheels, moving faster and faster by day\r\nand by night, and accumulating Power till it was needed.\r\nIf only they would hold together till the moment came!\r\n\r\nSo we all ground through the first slow year of the\r\nwar.  George in his place, I in mine, Brannan in his,--we\r\nlifted as we could.  But how heavy the weight seemed!  It\r\nwas in the second year, when the second large loan was\r\nplaced, that Haliburton wrote to me,--I got the letter,\r\nI think, at Hilton Head,--that he had sold out every\r\npenny of our railroad stocks, at the high prices which\r\nrailroad stocks then bore, and had invested the whole\r\nfifty-nine thousand in the new Governments.  \"I could\r\nnot call a board meeting,\" said Haliburton, \"for I am\r\nhere only on leave of absence, and the rest are all away.\r\nBut the case is clear enough.  If the government goes up,\r\nthe MOON will never go up; and, for one, I do not look\r\nbeyond the veil.\"  So he wrote to us all, and of course\r\nwe all approved.\r\n\r\nSo it was that Jeff. Davis also served.  Deep must\r\nthat man go into the Pit who does not serve, though\r\nunconscious.  For thus it was that, in the fourth year of\r\nthe war, when gold was at 290, Haliburton was receiving\r\non his fifty-nine thousand dollars seventeen per cent\r\ninterest in currency; thus was it that, before the war\r\nwas over, he had piled up, compounding his interest, more\r\nthan fifty per cent addition to his capital; thus was it\r\nthat, as soon as peace came, all his stocks were at a\r\nhandsome percentage; thus was it that, before I returned\r\nfrom South America, he reported to all the subscribers\r\nthat the full quarter-million was secured: thus was it\r\nthat, when I returned after that long cruise of mine in\r\nthe Florida, I found Polly and the children again at No.\r\n9, George there also, directing a working party of nearly\r\neighty bricklayers and hodmen, the lower centrings well-\r\nnigh filled to their diameter, and the BRICK MOON, to the\r\neye, seeming almost half completed.\r\n\r\nHere it is that I regret most of all that I cannot\r\nprint the working-drawings with this paper.  If you will\r\ncut open the seed-vessel of Spergularia Rubra, or any\r\nother carpel that has a free central placenta, and\r\nobserve how the circular seeds cling around the circular\r\ncentre, you will have some idea of the arrangement of a\r\ntransverse horizontal section of the completed MOON.  Lay\r\nthree croquet-balls on the piazza, and call one or two of\r\nthe children to help you poise seven in one plane above\r\nthe three; then let another child place three more above\r\nthe seven, and you have the CORE of the MOON\r\ncompletely.  If you want a more poetical illustration, it\r\nwas what Mr. Wordsworth calls a mass\r\n\r\n\"Of conglobated bubbles undissolved.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAny section through any diameter looked like an\r\nimmense rose-window, of six circles grouped round a\r\nseventh.  In truth, each of these sections would reveal\r\nthe existence of seven chambers in the moon,--each a\r\nsphere itself,--whose arches gave solidity to the whole;\r\nwhile yet, of the whole moon, the greater part was air.\r\nIn all there were thirteen of these moonlets, if I am so\r\nto call them; though no one section, of course, would\r\nreveal so many.  Sustained on each side by their groined\r\narches, the surface of the  whole moon was built over\r\nthem and under them,--simply two domes connected at the\r\nbases.  The chambers themselves were made lighter by\r\nleaving large, round windows or open circles in the parts\r\nof their vaults farthest from their points of contact, so\r\nthat each of them looked not unlike the outer sphere of\r\na Japanese ivory nest of concentric balls.  You see\r\nthe object was to make a moon, which, when left to its\r\nown gravity, should be fitly supported or braced within.\r\nDear George was sure that, by this constant repetition of\r\narches, we should with the least weight unite the\r\ngreatest strength.  I believe it still, and experience\r\nhas proved that there is strength enough.\r\n\r\nWhen I went up to No. 9, on my return from South\r\nAmerica, I found the lower centring up, and half full of\r\nthe working-bees,--who were really Keltic laborers,--all\r\nbusy in bringing up the lower half-dome of the shell.\r\nThis lower centring was of wood, in form exactly like a\r\nRoman amphitheatre if the seats of it be circular; on\r\nthis the lower or inverted brick dome was laid.  The\r\nwhole fabric was on one of the terraces which were heaved\r\nup in some old geological cataclysm, when some lake gave\r\nway, and the Carrotook River was born.  The level was\r\nhigher than that of the top of the fly-wheels, which,\r\nwith an awful velocity now, were circling in their wild\r\ncareer in the ravine below.  Three of the lowest\r\nmoonlets, as I have called them,--separate croquet-balls,\r\nif you take my other illustration,--had been completed;\r\ntheir centrings had been taken to pieces and drawn out\r\nthrough the holes, and were now set up again with other\r\nnew centrings for the second story of cells.\r\n\r\nI was received with wonder and delight.  I had\r\ntelegraphed my arrival, but the despatches had never\r\nbeen forwarded from Skowhegan.  Of course, we all had a\r\ndeal to tell; and, for me, there was no end to inquiries\r\nwhich I had to make in turn.  I was never tired of\r\nexploring the various spheres, and the nameless spaces\r\nbetween them.  I was never tired of talking with the\r\nlaborers.  All of us, indeed, became skilful bricklayers;\r\nand on a pleasant afternoon you might see Alice and\r\nBertha, and George and me, all laying brick together,--\r\nPolly sitting in the shade of some wall which had been\r\nbuilt high enough, and reading to us from Jean Ingelow or\r\nMonte-Cristo or Jane Austen, while little Clara brought\r\nto us our mortar.  Happily and lightly went by that\r\nsummer.  Haliburton and his wife made us a visit; Ben\r\nBrannan brought up his wife and children; Mrs. Haliburton\r\nherself put in the keystone to the central chamber, which\r\nhad always been named G on the plans; and at her\r\nsuggestion, it was named Grace now, because her mother's\r\nname was Hannah.  Before winter we had passed the\r\ndiameter of I, J, and K, the three uppermost cells of\r\nall; and the surrounding shell was closing in upon them.\r\nOn the whole, the funds had held out amazingly  well.\r\nThe wages had been rather higher than we meant; but the\r\nmen had no chances at liquor or dissipation, and had\r\nworked faster than we expected; and, with our new brick-\r\nmachines, we made brick inconceivably fast, while their\r\nquality was so good that dear George said there was never\r\nso little waste.  We celebrated Thanksgiving of that year\r\ntogether,--my family and his family.  We had paid\r\noff all the laborers; and there were left, of that busy\r\nvillage, only Asaph Langdon and his family, Levi Jordan\r\nand Levi Ross, Horace Leonard and Seth Whitman with\r\ntheirs.  \"Theirs,\" I say, but Ross had no family.  He was\r\na nice young fellow who was there as Haliburton's\r\nrepresentative, to take care of the accounts and the pay-\r\nroll; Jordan was the head of the brick-kilns; Leonard, of\r\nthe carpenters; and Whitman, of the commissariat,--and a\r\ngood commissary Whitman was.\r\n\r\nWe celebrated Thanksgiving together!  Ah me! what a\r\ncheerful, pleasant time we had; how happy the children\r\nwere together!  Polly and I and our bairns were to go to\r\nBoston the next day.  I was to spend the winter in one\r\nfinal effort to get twenty-five thousand dollars more if\r\nI could, with which we might paint the MOON, or put on\r\nsome ground felspathic granite dust, in a sort of paste,\r\nwhich in its hot flight through the air might fuse into\r\na white enamel.  All of us who saw the MOON were so\r\ndelighted with its success that we felt sure \"the\r\nfriends\" would not pause about this trifle.  The rest of\r\nthem were to stay there to watch the winter, and to be\r\nready to begin work the moment the snow had gone.\r\nThanksgiving afternoon, how well I remember it,--that\r\ngood fellow, Whitman, came and asked Polly and me to\r\nvisit his family in their new quarters.  They had moved\r\nfor the winter into cells B and E, so lofty, spacious,\r\nand warm, and so much drier than their log cabins.\r\nMrs. Whitman, I remember, was very cheerful and\r\njolly; made my children eat another piece of pie, and\r\nstuffed their pockets with raisins; and then with great\r\nceremony and fun we christened room B by the name of\r\nBertha, and E, Ellen, which was Mrs. Whitman's name.  And\r\nthe next day we bade them all good-by, little thinking\r\nwhat we said, and with endless promises of what we would\r\nsend and bring them in the spring.\r\n\r\nHere are the scraps of letters from Orcutt, dear\r\nfellow, which tell what more there is left to tell:--\r\n\r\n\"December 10th.\r\n\". . . After you left we were a little blue, and hung\r\nround loose for a day or two.  Sunday we missed you\r\nespecially, but Asaph made a good substitute, and Mrs.\r\nLeonard led the singing.  The next day we moved the\r\nLeonards into L and M, which we christened Leonard and\r\nMary (Mary is for your wife).  They are pretty dark, but\r\nvery dry.  Leonard has swung hammocks, as Whitman did.\r\n\r\n\"Asaph came to me Tuesday and said he thought they\r\nhad better turn to and put a shed over the unfinished\r\ncircle, and so take occasion of warm days for dry work\r\nthere.  This we have done, and the occupation is good for\r\nus. . . .\"\r\n\r\n\"December 25th.\r\nI have had no chance to write for a fortnight.  The\r\ntruth is, that the weather has been so open that I let\r\nAsaph go down to No. 7 and to Wilder's, and engage five-\r\nand-twenty of the best of the men, who, we knew, were\r\nhanging round there.  We have all been at work most of\r\nthe time since, with very good success.  H is now wholly\r\ncovered in, and the centring is out.  The men have named\r\nit Haliburton.  I is well advanced.  J is as you left it.\r\nThe work has been good for us all, morally.\"\r\n\r\n\"February 11th.\r\n\". . . We got your mail unexpectedly by some\r\nlumbermen on their way to the 9th Range.  One of them has\r\ncut himself, and takes this down.\r\n\r\n\"You will be amazed to hear that I and K are both\r\ndone.  We have had splendid weather, and have worked half\r\nthe time.  We had a great jollification when K was closed\r\nin,--called it Kilpatrick, for Seth's old general.  I\r\nwish you could just run up and see us.  You must be\r\nquick, if you want to put in any of the last licks.\r\n\r\n\"March 12th.\r\n\"DEAR FRED,--I have but an instant.  By all means\r\nmake your preparations to be here by the end of the month\r\nor early in next month.  The weather has been faultless,\r\nyou know.  Asaph got in a dozen more men, and we have\r\nbrought up the surface farther than you could dream.  The\r\nways are well forward, and I cannot see why, if the\r\nfreshet hold off a little, we should not launch her by\r\nthe 10th or 12th.  I do not think it worth while to wait\r\nfor paint or enamel.  Telegraph Brannan that he must be\r\nhere.  You will be amused by our quarters.  We, who were\r\nthe last outsiders, move into A and D to-morrow, for a\r\nfew weeks.  It is much warmer there.\r\n\"Ever yours,\r\nG. O.\"\r\n\r\nI telegraphed Brannan, and in reply he came with his\r\nwife and his children to Boston.  I told him that he\r\ncould not possibly get up there, as the roads then were;\r\nbut Ben said he would go to Skowhegan, and take his\r\nchance there.  He would, of course, communicate with me\r\nas soon as he got there.  Accordingly I got a note from\r\nhim at Skowhegan, saying he had hired a sleigh to go over\r\nto No. 9; and in four days more I got this letter:--\r\n\r\nMarch 27th.\r\nDEAR FRED,--I am most glad I came, and I beg you to\r\nbring your wife as soon as possible.  The river is very\r\nfull, the wheels, to which Leonard has added two\r\nauxiliaries, are moving as if they could not hold out\r\nlong, the ways are all but ready, and we think we must\r\nnot wait.  Start with all hands as soon as you can.  I\r\nhad no difficulty in coming over from Skowhegan.  We did\r\nit in two days.\r\n\r\nThis note I sent at once to Haliburton; and we got\r\nall the children ready for a winter journey, as the\r\nspectacle of the launch of the MOON was one to be\r\nremembered their life long.  But it was clearly\r\nimpossible to attempt, at that season, to get the\r\nsubscribers together.  Just as we started, this despatch\r\nfrom Skowhegan was brought me,--the last word I got from\r\nthem:--\r\n\r\nStop for nothing.  There is a jam below us in the\r\nstream, and we fear back-water.\r\nORCUTT.\r\n\r\nOf course we could not go faster than we could.  We\r\nmissed no connection.  At Skowhegan, Haliburton and I\r\ntook a cutter, leaving the ladies and children to follow\r\nat once in larger sleighs.  We drove all night, changed\r\nhorses at Prospect, and kept on all the next day.  At No.\r\n7 we had to wait over night.  We started early in the\r\nmorning, and came down the Spoonwood Hill at four in the\r\nafternoon, in full sight of our little village.\r\n\r\nIt was quiet as the grave!  Not a smoke, not a man,\r\nnot an adze-blow, nor the tick of a trowel.  Only the\r\ngigantic fly-wheels were whirling as I saw them last.\r\n\r\nThere was the lower Coliseum-like centring, somewhat\r\nas I first saw it.\r\n\r\nBut where was the Brick Dome of the MOON?\r\n\r\n\"Good Heavens! has it fallen on them all?\" cried I.\r\n\r\nHaliburton lashed the beast till he fairly ran down\r\nthat steep hill.  We turned a little point, and came out\r\nin front of the centring.  There was no MOON there!  An\r\nempty amphitheatre, with not a brick nor a splinter\r\nwithin!\r\n\r\nWe were speechless.  We left the cutter.  We ran up\r\nthe stairways to the terrace.  We ran by the familiar\r\npaths into the centring.  We came out upon the ways,\r\nwhich we had never seen before.  These told the story too\r\nwell!  The ground and crushed surface of the timbers,\r\nscorched by the rapidity with which the MOON had slid\r\ndown, told that they had done the duty for which they\r\nwere built.\r\n\r\nIt was too clear that in some wild rush of the waters\r\nthe ground had yielded a trifle.  We could not find that\r\nthe foundations had sunk more than six inches, but that\r\nwas enough.  In that fatal six inches' decline of the\r\ncentring, the MOON had been launched upon the ways just\r\nas George had intended that it should be when he was\r\nready.  But it had slid, not rolled, down upon these\r\nangry fly-wheels, and in an instant, with all our\r\nfriends, it had been hurled into the sky!\r\n\r\n\"They have gone up!\" said Haliburton; \"She has gone\r\nup!\" said I;--both in one breath.  And with a common\r\ninstinct, we looked up into the blue.\r\n\r\nBut of course she was not there.\r\n\r\n--------\r\n\r\nNot a shred of letter or any other tidings could we\r\nfind in any of the shanties.  It was indeed six weeks\r\nsince George and Fanny and their children had moved into\r\nAnnie and Diamond,--two unoccupied cells of the MOON,--so\r\nmuch more comfortable had the cells proved than the\r\ncabins, for winter life.  Returning to No. 7, we found\r\nthere many of the laborers, who were astonished at what\r\nwe told them.  They had been paid off on the 30th, and\r\ntold to come up again on the 15th of April, to see the\r\nlaunch.  One of them, a man named Rob Shea, told me that\r\nGeorge kept his cousin Peter to help him move back into\r\nhis house the beginning of the next week.\r\n\r\nAnd that was the last I knew of any of them for\r\nmore than a year.  At first I expected, each hour, to\r\nhear that they had fallen somewhere.  But time passed by,\r\nand of such a fall, where man knows the world's surface,\r\nthere was no tale.  I answered, as best I could, the\r\nletters of their friends; by saying I did not know where\r\nthey were, and had not heard from them.  My real thought\r\nwas, that if this fatal MOON did indeed pass our\r\natmosphere, all in it must have been burned to death in\r\nthe transit.  But this I whispered to no one save to\r\nPolly and Annie and Haliburton.  In this terrible doubt\r\nI remained, till I noticed one day in the \"Astronomical\r\nRecord\" the memorandum, which you perhaps remember, of\r\nthe observation, by Dr. Zitta, of a new asteroid, with an\r\nenormous movement in declination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nFULFILMENT\r\n\r\nLooking back upon it now, it seems inconceivable that\r\nwe said as little to each other as we did, of this\r\nhorrible catastrophe.  That night we did not pretend to\r\nsleep.  We sat in one of the deserted cabins, now\r\ntalking fast, now sitting and brooding, without\r\nspeaking, perhaps, for hours.  Riding back the next day\r\nto meet the women and children, we still brooded, or we\r\ndiscussed this \"if,\" that \"if,\" and yet others.  But\r\nafter we had once opened it all to them,--and when we\r\nhad once answered the children's horribly naive\r\nquestions as best we could,--we very seldom spoke to\r\neach other of it again.  It was too hateful, all of it,\r\nto talk about.  I went round to Tom Coram's office one\r\nday, and told him all I knew.  He saw it was dreadful\r\nto me, and, with his eyes full, just squeezed my hand,\r\nand never said one word more.  We lay awake nights,\r\npondering and wondering, but hardly ever did I to\r\nHaliburton or he to me explain our respective notions\r\nas they came and went.  I believe my general impression\r\nwas that of which I have spoken, that they were all\r\nburned to death on the instant, as the little aerolite\r\nfused in its passage through our atmosphere.  I believe\r\nHaliburton's thought more often was that they were\r\nconscious of what had happened, and gasped out their\r\nlives in one or two breathless minutes,--so horribly\r\nlong!--as they shot outside of our atmosphere.  But it\r\nwas all too terrible for words.  And that which we could\r\nnot but think upon, in those dreadful waking nights, we\r\nscarcely whispered even to our wives.\r\n\r\nOf course I looked and he looked for the miserable\r\nthing.  But we looked in vain.  I returned to the few\r\nsubscribers the money which I had scraped together\r\ntowards whitewashing the moon,--\"shrouding its guilty\r\nface with innocent white\" indeed!  But we agreed to spend\r\nthe wretched trifle of the other money, left in the\r\ntreasury after paying the last bills, for the largest\r\nAlvan Clark telescope that we could buy; and we were\r\nfortunate in obtaining cheap a second-hand one which\r\ncame to the hammer when the property of the Shubael\r\nAcademy was sold by the mortgagees.  But we had, of\r\ncourse, scarce a hint whatever as to where the miserable\r\nobject was to be found.  All we could do was to carry the\r\nglass to No. 9, to train it there on the meridian of No.\r\n9, and take turns every night in watching the field, in\r\nthe hope that this child of sorrow might drift across it\r\nin its path of ruin.  But, though everything else seemed\r\nto drift by, from east to west, nothing came from south\r\nto north, as we expected.  For a whole month of spring,\r\nanother of autumn, another of summer, and another of\r\nwinter, did Haliburton and his wife and Polly and I glue\r\nour eyes to that eye-glass, from the twilight of evening\r\nto the twilight of morning, and the dead hulk never hove\r\nin sight.  Wherever else it was, it seemed not to be on\r\nthat meridian, which was where it ought to be and was\r\nmade to be!  Had ever any dead mass of matter wrought\r\nsuch ruin to its makers, and, of its own stupid inertia,\r\nso falsified all the prophecies of its birth!  Oh, the\r\ntotal depravity of things!\r\n\r\nIt was more than a year after the fatal night,--if it\r\nall happened in the night, as I suppose,--that, as I\r\ndreamily read through the \"Astronomical Record\" in the\r\nnew reading-room of the College Library at Cambridge, I\r\nlighted on this scrap:--\r\n\r\n\"Professor Karl Zitta of Breslau writes to the\r\nAstronomische Nachrichten to claim the discovery\r\nof a new asteroid observed by him on the night of\r\nMarch 31st.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           App. A.

Dr.\r\nZitta states that in the short period which he had for\r\nobserving Phoebe, for an hour after midnight, her motion\r\nin R. A. seemed slight and her motion in declination very\r\nrapid.\"\r\n\r\nAfter this, however, for months, nay even to this\r\nmoment, nothing more was heard of Dr. Zitta of Breslau.\r\n\r\nBut, one morning, before I was up, Haliburton came\r\nbanging at my door on D Street.  The mood had taken him,\r\nas he returned from some private theatricals at\r\nCambridge, to take the comfort of the new reading-room at\r\nnight, and thus express in practice his gratitude to the\r\noverseers of the college for keeping it open through all\r\nthe twenty-four hours.  Poor Haliburton, he did not sleep\r\nwell in those times!  Well, as he read away on the\r\nAstronomische Nachrichten itself, what should he find\r\nbut this in German, which he copied for me, and then, all\r\non foot in the rain and darkness, tramped over with, to\r\nSouth Boston:--\r\n\r\n\"The most enlightened head professor Dr. Gmelin\r\nwrites to the director of the Porpol Astronomik at\r\nSt. Petersburg, to claim the discovery of an asteroid in\r\na very high southern latitude, of a wider inclination of\r\nthe orbit, as will be noticed, than any asteroid yet\r\nobserved.\r\n\r\n\"Planet's apparent {alpha} 21^h. 20^m. 51^s.40.\r\nPlanet's apparent {delta}-39@ 31' 11\".9.  Comparison star\r\n{alpha}.\r\n\r\n\"Dr. Gmelin publishes no separate second observation,\r\nbut is confident that the declination is diminishing.\r\nDr. Gmelin suggests for the name of this extra-zodiacal\r\nplanet `Io,' as appropriate to its wanderings from the\r\naccustomed ways of planetary life, and trusts that the\r\nvery distinguished Herr Peters, the godfather of so many\r\nplanets, will relinquish this name, already claimed for\r\nthe asteroid (85) observed by him, September 15, 1865.\"\r\n\r\nI had run down stairs almost as I was, slippers and\r\ndressing-gown being the only claims I had on society.\r\nBut to me, as to Haliburton, this stuff about \"extra-\r\nzodiacal wandering\" blazed out upon the page, and though\r\nthere was no evidence that the \"most enlightened\" Gmelin\r\nfound anything the next night, yet, if his \"diminishing\"\r\nmeant anything, there was, with Zitta's observation,--\r\nwhoever Zitta might be,--something to start upon.  We\r\nrushed upon some old bound volumes of the Record and\r\nspotted the \"enlightened Gmelin.\"  He was chief of a\r\ncollege at Taganrog, where perhaps they had a spyglass.\r\nThis gave us the parallax of his observation.  Breslau,\r\nof course, we knew, and so we could place Zitta's,\r\nand with these poor data I went to work to construct,\r\nif I could, an orbit for this Io-Phoebe mass of brick and\r\nmortar.  Haliburton, not strong in spherical\r\ntrigonometry, looked out logarithms for me till\r\nbreakfast, and, as soon as it would do, went over to Mrs.\r\nBowdoin, to borrow her telescope, ours being left at No.\r\n9.\r\n\r\nMrs. Bowdoin was kind, as she always was, and at noon\r\nHaliburton appeared in triumph with the boxes on P.\r\nNolan's job-wagon.  We always employ P., in memory of\r\ndear old Phil.  We got the telescope rigged, and waited\r\nfor night, only, alas! to be disappointed again.  Io had\r\nwandered somewhere else, and, with all our sweeping back\r\nand forth on the tentative curve I had laid out, Io would\r\nnot appear.  We spent that night in vain.\r\n\r\nBut we were not going to give it up so.  Phoebe might\r\nhave gone round the world twice before she became Io;\r\nmight have gone three times, four, five, six,--nay, six\r\nhundred,--who knew?  Nay, who knew how far off Phoebe-\r\nIo was or Io-Phoebe?  We sent over for Annie, and\r\nshe and Polly and George and I went to work again.  We\r\ncalculated in the next week sixty-seven orbits on the\r\nsupposition of so many different distances from our\r\nsurface.  I laid out on a paper, which we stuck up on the\r\nwall opposite, the formula, and then one woman and one\r\nman attacked each set of elements, each having the\r\nLogarithmic Tables, and so in a week's working-time the\r\nsixty-seven orbits were completed.  Seventy-seven\r\npossible places for Io-Phoebe to be in on the\r\nforthcoming Friday evening.  Of these sixty-seven, forty-\r\none were observable above our horizon that night.\r\n\r\nShe was not in one of the forty-one, nor near it.\r\n\r\nBut Despair, if Giotto be correct, is the chief of\r\nsins.  So has he depicted her in the fresco of the Arena\r\nin Padua.  No sin, that, of ours!  After searching all\r\nthat Friday night, we slept all Saturday (sleeping after\r\nsweeping).  We all came to the Chapel, Sunday, kept awake\r\nthere, and taught our Sunday classes special lessons on\r\nPerseverance.  On Monday we began again, and that week we\r\ncalculated sixty-seven more orbits.  I am sure I do not\r\nknow why we stopped at sixty-seven.  All of these were on\r\nthe supposition that the revolution of the Brick Moon, or\r\nIo-Phoebe, was so fast that it would require either\r\nfifteen days to complete its orbit, or sixteen days, or\r\nseventeen days, and so on up to eighty-one days.  And,\r\nwith these orbits, on the next Friday we waited for the\r\ndarkness.  As we sat at tea, I asked if I should begin\r\nobserving at the smallest or at the largest orbit.  And\r\nthere was a great clamor of diverse opinions.  But little\r\nBertha said, \"Begin in the middle.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what is the middle?\" said George, chaffing the\r\nlittle girl.\r\n\r\nBut she was not to be dismayed.  She had been in and\r\nout all the week, and knew that the first orbit was of\r\nfifteen days and the last of eighty-one; and, with true\r\nLincoln School precision, she said, \"The mean of the\r\nsmallest orbit and the largest orbit is forty-eight\r\ndays.\"\r\n\r\n\"Amen!\" said I, as we all laughed.  \"On forty-eight\r\ndays we will begin.\"\r\n\r\nAlice ran to the sheets, turned up that number, and\r\nread, \"R.  A. 27@ 11'.  South declination 34@ 49'.\"\r\n\r\n\"Convenient place,\" said George; \"good omen, Bertha,\r\nmy darling!  If we find her there, Alice and Bertha and\r\nClara shall all have new dolls.\"\r\n\r\nIt was the first word of pleasantry that had been\r\nspoken about the horrid thing since Spoonwood Hill!\r\n\r\nNight came at last.  We trained the glass on the\r\nfated spot.  I bade Polly take the eye-glass.  She did\r\nso, shook her head uneasily, screwed the tube northward\r\nherself a moment, and then screamed, \"It is there! it is\r\nthere,--a clear disk,--gibbous shape,--and very sharp on\r\nthe upper edge.  Look! look! as big again as Jupiter!\"\r\n\r\nPolly was right!  The Brick Moon was found!\r\n\r\nNow we had found it, we never lost it.  Zitta and\r\nGmelin, I suppose, had had foggy nights and stormy\r\nweather often.  But we had some one at the eye-glass all\r\nthat night, and before morning had very respectable\r\nelements, good measurements of angular distance when we\r\ngot one, from another star in the field of our lowest\r\npower.  For we could see her even with a good French\r\nopera-glass I had, and with a night-glass which I used to\r\ncarry on the South Atlantic Station.  It certainly\r\nwas an extraordinary illustration of Orcutt's engineering\r\nability, that, flying off as she did, without leave or\r\nlicense, she should have gained so nearly the orbit of\r\nour original plan,--nine thousand miles from the earth's\r\ncentre, five thousand from the surface.  He had always\r\nstuck to the hope of this, and on his very last tests of\r\nthe Flies he had said they, were almost up to it.  But\r\nfor this accuracy of his, I can hardly suppose we should\r\nhave found her to this hour, since she had failed, by\r\nwhat cause I then did not know, to take her intended\r\nplace on the meridian of No. 9. At five thousand miles\r\nthe MOON appeared as large as the largest satellite of\r\nJupiter appears.  And Polly was right in that first\r\nobservation, when she said she got a good disk with that\r\nadmirable glass of Mrs. Bowdoin.\r\n\r\nThe orbit was not on the meridian of No. 9, nor did\r\nit remain on any meridian.  But it was very nearly South\r\nand North,--an enormous motion in declination with a very\r\nslight RETROGRADE motion in Right Ascension.  At five\r\nthousand miles the MOON showed as large as a circle two\r\nmiles and a third in diameter would have shown on old\r\nThornbush, as we always called her older sister.  We\r\nlonged for an eclipse of Thornbush by B. M., but no such\r\nlucky chance is on the cards in any place accessible to\r\nus for many years.  Of course, with a MOON so near us the\r\nterrestrial parallax is enormous.\r\n\r\nNow, you know, dear reader, that the gigantic\r\nreflector of Lord Rosse, and the exquisite fifteen-\r\ninch refractors of the modern observatories, eliminate\r\nfrom the chaotic rubbish-heap of the surface of old\r\nThornbush much smaller objects than such a circle as I\r\nhave named.  If you have read Mr. Locke's amusing Moon\r\nHoax as often as I have, you have those details fresh in\r\nyour memory.  As John Farrar taught us when all this\r\nbegan,--and as I have said already,--if there were a\r\nState House in Thornbush two hundred feet long, the first\r\nHerschel would have seen it.  His magnifying power was\r\n6450; that would have brought this deaf and dumb State\r\nHouse within some forty miles.  Go up on Mt. Washington\r\nand see white sails eighty miles away, beyond Portland,\r\nwith your naked eye, and you will find how well he would\r\nhave seen that State House with his reflector.  Lord\r\nRosse's statement is, that with his reflector he can see\r\nobjects on old Thornbush two hundred and fifty-two feet\r\nlong.  If he can do that he can see on our B. M. objects\r\nwhich are five feet long; and, of course, we were beside\r\nourselves to get control of some instrument which had\r\nsome approach to such power.  Haliburton was for at once\r\nbuilding a reflector at No. 9; and perhaps he will do it\r\nyet, for Haliburton has been successful in his paper-\r\nmaking and lumbering.  But I went to work more promptly.\r\n\r\nI remembered, not an apothecary, but an observatory,\r\nwhich had been dormant, as we say of volcanoes, now for\r\nten or a dozen years,--no matter why!  The trustees\r\nhad quarrelled with the director, or the funds had given\r\nout, or the director had been shot at the head of his\r\ndivision,--one of those accidents had happened which will\r\nhappen even in observatories which have fifteen-inch\r\nequatorials; and so the equatorial here had been left as\r\nuseless as a cannon whose metal has been strained or its\r\nreputation stained in an experiment.  The observatory at\r\nTamworth, dedicated with such enthusiasm,--\"another\r\nlight-house in the skies,\" had been, so long as I have\r\nsaid, worthless to the world.  To Tamworth, therefore, I\r\ntravelled.  In the neighborhood of the observatory I took\r\nlodgings.  To the church where worshipped the family\r\nwhich lived in the observatory buildings I repaired;\r\nafter two Sundays I established acquaintance with John\r\nDonald, the head of this family.  On the evening of the\r\nthird, I made acquaintance with his wife in a visit to\r\nthem.  Before three Sundays more he had recommended me to\r\nthe surviving trustees as his successor as janitor to the\r\nbuildings.  He himself had accepted promotion, and gone,\r\nwith his household, to keep a store for Haliburton in\r\nNorth Ovid.  I sent for Polly and the children, to\r\nestablish them in the janitor's rooms; and, after writing\r\nto her, with trembling eye I waited for the Brick Moon to\r\npass over the field of the fifteen-inch equatorial.\r\n\r\nNight came.  I was \"sole alone\"!  B. M. came, more\r\nthan filled the field of vision, of course! but for that\r\nI was ready.  Heavens! how changed.  Red no longer,\r\nbut green as a meadow in the spring.  Still I could see--\r\nblack on the green--the large twenty-foot circles which\r\nI remembered so well, which broke the concave of the\r\ndome; and, on the upper edge--were these palm-trees?\r\nThey were.  No, they were hemlocks, by their shape, and\r\namong them were moving to and fro---------- flies?  Of\r\ncourse, I cannot see flies!  But something is moving,--\r\ncoming, going.  One, two, three, ten; there are more than\r\nthirty in all!  They are men and women and their\r\nchildren!\r\n\r\nCould it be possible?  It was possible!  Orcutt and\r\nBrannan and the rest of them had survived that giddy\r\nflight through the ether, and were going and coming on\r\nthe surface of their own little world, bound to it by its\r\nown attraction and living by its own laws!\r\n\r\nAs I watched, I saw one of them leap from that\r\nsurface.  He passed wholly out of my field of vision, but\r\nin a minute, more or less, returned.  Why not!  Of course\r\nthe attraction of his world must be very small, while he\r\nretained the same power of muscle he had when he was\r\nhere.  They must be horribly crowded, I thought.  No.\r\nThey had three acres of surface, and there were but\r\nthirty-seven of them.  Not so much crowded as people are\r\nin Roxbury, not nearly so much as in Boston; and,\r\nbesides, these people are living underground, and have\r\nthe whole of their surface for their exercise.\r\n\r\nI watched their every movement as they approached the\r\nedge and as they left it.  Often they passed beyond it,\r\nso that I could see them no more.  Often they sheltered\r\nthemselves from that tropical sun beneath the trees.\r\nThink of living on a world where from the vertical heat\r\nof the hottest noon of the equator to the twilight of the\r\npoles is a walk of only fifty paces!  What atmosphere\r\nthey had, to temper and diffuse those rays, I could not\r\nthen conjecture.\r\n\r\nI knew that at half-past ten they would pass into the\r\ninevitable eclipse which struck them every night at this\r\nperiod of their orbit, and must, I thought, be a luxury\r\nto them, as recalling old memories of night when they\r\nwere on this world.  As they approached the line of\r\nshadow, some fifteen minutes before it was due, I counted\r\non the edge thirty-seven specks arranged evidently in\r\norder; and, at one moment, as by one signal, all thirty-\r\nseven jumped into the air,--high jumps.  Again they did\r\nit, and again.  Then a low jump; then a high one.  I\r\ncaught the idea in a moment.  They were telegraphing to\r\nour world, in the hope of an observer.  Long leaps and\r\nshort leaps,--the long and short of Morse's Telegraph\r\nAlphabet,--were communicating ideas.  My paper and pencil\r\nhad been of course before me.  I jotted down the\r\ndespatch, whose language I knew perfectly:--\r\n\r\n\"Show `I understand' on the Saw-Mill Flat.\"\r\n\"Show `I understand' on the Saw-Mill Flat.\"\r\n\"Show `I understand' on the Saw-Mill Flat.\"\r\n\r\nBy \"I understand\" they meant the responsive signal\r\ngiven, in all telegraphy, by an operator who has received\r\nand understood a message.\r\n\r\nAs soon as this exercise had been three times\r\nrepeated, they proceeded in a solid body--much the most\r\napparent object I had had until now--to Circle No. 3, and\r\nthen evidently descended into the MOON.\r\n\r\nThe eclipse soon began, but I knew the MOON'S path\r\nnow, and followed the dusky, coppery spot without\r\ndifficulty.  At 1.33 it emerged, and in a very few\r\nmoments I saw the solid column pass from Circle No. 3\r\nagain, deploy on the edge again, and repeat three times\r\nthe signal:--\r\n\r\n\"Show `I understand' on the Saw-Mill Flat.\"\r\n\"Show `I understand' on the Saw-Mill Flat.\"\r\n\"Show `I understand' on the Saw-Mill Flat.\"\r\n\r\nIt was clear that Orcutt had known that the edge of\r\nhis little world would be most easy of observation, and\r\nthat he had guessed that the moments of obscuration and\r\nof emersion were the moments when observers would be most\r\ncareful.  After this signal they broke up again, and I\r\ncould not follow them.  With daylight I sent off a\r\ndespatch to Haliburton, and, grateful and happy in\r\ncomparison, sank into the first sleep not haunted by\r\nhorrid dreams, which I had known for years.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaliburton knew that George Orcutt had taken with him\r\na good Dolland's refractor, which he had bought in\r\nLondon, of a two-inch glass.  He knew that this would\r\ngive Orcutt a very considerable power, if he could only\r\nadjust it accurately enough to find No. 9 in the 3d\r\nRange.  Orcutt had chosen well in selecting the \"Saw-Mill\r\nFlat,\" a large meadow, easily distinguished by the\r\npeculiar shape of the mill-pond which we had made.  Eager\r\nthough Haliburton was to join me, he loyally took moneys,\r\ncaught the first train to Skowhegan, and, travelling\r\nthence, in thirty-six hours more was again descending\r\nSpoonwood Hill, for the first time since our futile\r\nobservations.  The snow lay white upon the Flat.  With\r\nRob. Shea's help, he rapidly unrolled a piece of black\r\ncambric twenty yards long, and pinned it to the crust\r\nupon the snow; another by its side, and another.  Much\r\ncambric had he left.  They had carried down with them\r\nenough for the funerals of two Presidents.  Haliburton\r\nshowed the symbols for \"I understand,\" but he could not\r\nresist also displaying ..-- .--, which are the dots and\r\nlines to represent O. K., which, he says, is the\r\nshortest message of comfort.  And not having exhausted\r\nthe space on the Flat, he and Robert, before night closed\r\nin, made a gigantic O. K., fifteen yards from top to\r\nbottom, and in marks that were fifteen feet through.\r\nI had telegraphed my great news to Haliburton on\r\nMonday night.  Tuesday night he was at Skowhegan.\r\nThursday night he was at No. 9.  Friday he and Rob.\r\nstretched their cambric.  Meanwhile, every day I slept.\r\nEvery night I was glued to the eye-piece.  Fifteen\r\nminutes before the eclipse every night this weird dance\r\nof leaps two hundred feet high, followed by hops of\r\ntwenty feet high, mingled always in the steady order I\r\nhave described, spelt out the ghastly message:  \"Show `I\r\nunderstand' on the Saw-Mill Flat.\"\r\n\r\nAnd every morning, as the eclipse ended, I saw the\r\ncolumn creep along to the horizon, and again, as the duty\r\nof opening day, spell out the same:--\r\n\r\n\"Show `I understand' on the Saw-Mill Flat.\"\r\n\r\nThey had done this twice in every twenty-four hours\r\nfor nearly two years.  For three nights steadily I read\r\nthese signals twice each night; only these, and nothing\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nBut Friday night all was changed.  After \"Attention,\"\r\nthat dreadful \"Show\" did not come, but this cheerful\r\nsignal:--\r\n\r\n\"Hurrah.  All well.  Air, food, and friends! what\r\nmore can man require?  Hurrah.\"\r\n\r\nHow like George!  How like Ben Brannan!  How like\r\nGeorge's wife!  How like them all!  And they were all\r\nwell!  Yet poor _I_ could not answer.  Nay, I could\r\nonly guess what Haliburton had done.  But I have never,\r\nI believe, been so grateful since I was born.\r\n\r\nAfter a pause, the united line of leapers resumed\r\ntheir jumps and hops.  Long and short spelled out:--\r\n\r\n\"Your O. K. is twice as large as it need be.\"\r\n\r\nOf the meaning of this, lonely _I_ had, of course,\r\nno idea.\r\n\r\n\"I have a power of seven hundred,\" continued George.\r\nHow did he get that?  He has never told us.  But this I\r\ncan see, that all our analogies deceive us,--of views of\r\nthe sea from Mt. Washington, or of the Boston State House\r\nfrom Wachusett.  For in these views we look through forty\r\nor eighty miles of dense terrestrial atmosphere.  But\r\nOrcutt was looking nearly vertically through an\r\natmosphere which was, most of it, rare indeed, and pure\r\nindeed, compared with its lowest stratum.\r\n\r\nIn the record-book of my observations these\r\ndespatches are entered as 12 and 13.  Of course it was\r\nimpossible for me to reply.  All I could do was to\r\ntelegraph these in the morning to Skowhegan, sending them\r\nto the care of the Moores, that they might forward them.\r\nBut the next night showed that this had not been\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nFriday night George and the others went on for a\r\nquarter of an hour.  Then they would rest, saying, \"two,\"\r\n\"three,\" or whatever their next signal time would be.\r\nBefore morning I had these despatches:--\r\n\r\n14. \"Write to all hands that we are doing well.\r\nLangdon's baby is named Io, and Leonard's is named\r\nPhoebe.\"\r\n\r\nHow queer that was!  What a coincidence!  And they\r\nhad some humor there.\r\n\r\n15 was:  \"Our atmosphere stuck to us.  It weighs\r\nthree tenths of an inch--our weight.\"\r\n\r\n16. \"Our rain-fall is regular as the clock.  We have\r\nmade a cistern of Kilpatrick.\"\r\n\r\nThis meant the spherical chamber of that name.\r\n\r\n17. \"Write to Darwin that he is all right.  We began\r\nwith lichens and have come as far as palms and hemlocks.\"\r\n\r\nThese were the first night's messages.  I had\r\nscarcely covered the eye-glasses and adjusted the\r\nequatorial for the day, when the bell announced the\r\ncarriage in which Polly and the children came from the\r\nstation to relieve me in my solitary service as janitor.\r\nI had the joy of showing her the good news.  This night's\r\nwork seemed to fill our cup.  For all the day before,\r\nwhen I was awake, I had been haunted by the fear of\r\nfamine for them.  True, I knew that they had stored away\r\nin chambers H, I, and J the pork and flour which we had\r\nsent up for the workmen through the summer, and the corn\r\nand oats for the horses.  But this could not last\r\nforever.\r\n\r\nNow, however, that it proved that in a tropical\r\nclimate they were forming their own soil, developing\r\ntheir own palms, and eventually even their bread-fruit\r\nand bananas, planting their own oats and maize, and\r\ndeveloping rice, wheat, and all other cereals, harvesting\r\nthese six, eight, or ten times--for aught I could see--in\r\none of our years,--why, then, there was no danger of\r\nfamine for them.  If, as I thought, they carried up with\r\nthem heavy drifts of ice and snow in the two chambers\r\nwhich were not covered in when they started, why, they\r\nhad waters in their firmament quite sufficient for all\r\npurposes of thirst and of ablution.  And what I had seen\r\nof their exercise showed that they were in strength\r\nsufficient for the proper development of their little\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nPolly had the messages by heart before an hour was\r\nover, and the little girls, of course, knew them sooner\r\nthan she.\r\n\r\nHaliburton, meanwhile, had brought out the Shubael\r\nrefractor (Alvan Clark), and by night of Friday was in\r\nreadiness to see what he could see.  Shubael of course\r\ngave him no such luxury of detail as did my fifteen-inch\r\nequatorial.  But still he had no difficulty in making out\r\ngroves of hemlock, and the circular openings.  And\r\nalthough he could not make out my thirty-seven flies,\r\nstill when 10.15 came he saw distinctly the black square\r\ncrossing from hole Mary to the edge, and beginning its\r\nDervish dances.  They were on his edge more precisely\r\nthan on mine.  For Orcutt knew nothing of Tamworth, and\r\nhad thought his best chance was to display for No. 9. So\r\nwas it that, at the same moment with me, Haliburton also\r\nwas spelling out Orcutt & Co.'s joyous \"Hurrah!\"\r\n\r\n\"Thtephen,\" lisps Celia, \"promith that you will look\r\nat yon moon [old Thombush] at the inthtant I do.\"  So was\r\nit with me and Haliburton.\r\n\r\nHe was of course informed long before the Moores'\r\nmessenger came, that, in Orcutt's judgment, twenty feet\r\nof length were sufficient for his signals.  Orcutt's\r\natmosphere, of course, must be exquisitely clear.\r\n\r\nSo, on Saturday, Rob. and Haliburton pulled up all\r\ntheir cambric and arranged it on the Flat again, in\r\nletters of twenty feet, in this legend:--\r\n\r\nRAH.  AL WEL.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaliburton said he could not waste flat or cambric on\r\nspelling.\r\n\r\nHe had had all night since half-past ten to consider\r\nwhat next was most important for them to know; and a very\r\ndifficult question it was, you will observe.  They had\r\nbeen gone nearly two years, and much had happened.  Which\r\nthing was, on the whole, the most interesting and\r\nimportant?  He had said we were all well.  What then?\r\n\r\nDid you never find yourself in the same difficulty?\r\nWhen your husband had come home from sea, and kissed you\r\nand the children, and wondered at their size, did you\r\nnever sit silent and have to think what you should say?\r\nWere you never fairly relieved when little Phil said,\r\nblustering, \"I got three eggs to-day.\"  The truth is,\r\nthat silence is very satisfactory intercourse, if we only\r\nknow all is well.  When De Sauty got his original cable\r\ngoing, he had not much to tell after all; only that\r\nconsols were a quarter per cent higher than they were\r\nthe day before.  \"Send me news,\" lisped he--poor lonely\r\nmyth!--from Bull's Bay to Valentia,--\"send me news; they\r\nare mad for news.\"  But how if there be no news worth\r\nsending?  What do I read in my cable despatch to-day?\r\nOnly that the Harvard crew pulled at Putney yesterday,\r\nwhich I knew before I opened the paper, and that there\r\nhad been a riot in Spain, which I also knew.  Here is a\r\nletter just brought me by the mail from Moreau, Tazewell\r\nCounty, Iowa.  It is written by Follansbee, in a good\r\ncheerful hand.  How glad I am to hear from Follansbee!\r\nYes; but do I care one straw whether Follansbee planted\r\nspring wheat or winter wheat?  Not I.  All I care for is\r\nFollansbee's way of telling it.  All these are the\r\nremarks by which Haliburton explains the character of the\r\nmessages he sent in reply to George Orcutt's autographs,\r\nwhich were so thoroughly satisfactory.\r\n\r\nShould he say Mr. Borie had left the Navy Department\r\nand Mr. Robeson come in?  Should he say the Lords had\r\nbacked down on the Disendowment Bill?  Should he say the\r\ntelegraph had been landed at Duxbury?  Should he say\r\nIngham had removed to Tamworth?  What did they care for\r\nthis?  What does anybody ever care for facts?  Should he\r\nsay that the State Constable was enforcing the liquor law\r\non whiskey, but was winking at lager?  All this would\r\ntake him a week, in the most severe condensation,--\r\nand for what good? as Haliburton asked.  Yet these were\r\nthe things that the newspapers told, and they told\r\nnothing else.  There was a nice little poem of Jean\r\nIngelow's in a Transcript Haliburton had with him.  He\r\nsaid he was really tempted to spell that out.  It was\r\nbetter worth it than all the rest of the newspaper stuff,\r\nand would be remembered a thousand years after that was\r\nforgotten.  \"What they wanted,\" says Haliburton, \"was\r\nsentiment.  That is all that survives and is eternal.\"\r\nSo he and Rob. laid out their cambric thus:--\r\n\r\nRAW.  AL WEL.  SO GLAD.\r\n\r\nHaliburton hesitated whether he would not add, \"Power\r\n5000,\" to indicate the full power I was using at\r\nTamworth.  But he determined not to, and, I think,\r\nwisely.  The convenience was so great, of receiving the\r\nsignal at the spot where it could be answered, that for\r\nthe present he thought it best that they should go on\r\nas they did.  That night, however, to his dismay,\r\nclouds gathered and a grim snow-storm began.  He got no\r\nobservations; and the next day it stormed so heavily\r\nthat he could not lay his signals out.  For me at\r\nTamworth, I had a heavy storm all day, but at midnight\r\nit was clear; and as soon as the regular eclipse was\r\npast, George began with what we saw was an account of\r\nthe great anaclysm which sent them there.  You observe\r\nthat Orcutt had far greater power of communicating with\r\nus than we had with him.  He knew this.  And it was\r\nfortunate he had.  For he had, on his little world,\r\nmuch more of interest to tell than we had on our large\r\none.\r\n\r\n18. \"It stormed hard.  We were all asleep, and knew\r\nnothing till morning; the hammocks turned so slowly.\"\r\n\r\nHere was another revelation and relief.  I had always\r\nsupposed that if they knew anything before they were\r\nroasted to death, they had had one wild moment of horror.\r\nInstead of this, the gentle slide of the MOON had not\r\nwakened them, the flight upward had been as easy as it\r\nwas rapid, the change from one centre of gravity to\r\nanother had of course been slow,--and they had actually\r\nslept through the whole.  After the dancers had rested\r\nonce, Orcutt continued:--\r\n\r\n19. \"We cleared E. A. in two seconds, I think.  Our\r\nouter surface fused and cracked somewhat.  So much the\r\nbetter for us.\"\r\n\r\nThey moved so fast that the heat of their friction\r\nthrough the air could not propagate itself through the\r\nwhole brick surface.  Indeed, there could have been but\r\nlittle friction after the first five or ten miles.  By E.\r\nA. he means earth's atmosphere.\r\n\r\nHis 20th despatch is:  \"I have no observations of\r\nascent.  But by theory our positive ascent ceased in two\r\nminutes five seconds, when we fell into our proper orbit,\r\nwhich, as I calculate, is 5,109 miles from your mean\r\nsurface.\"\r\n\r\nIn all this, observe, George dropped no word of\r\nregret through these five thousand miles.\r\n\r\nHis 21st despatch is:  \"Our rotation on our axis is\r\nmade once in seven hours, our axis being exactly vertical\r\nto the plane of our own orbit.  But in each of your daily\r\nrotations we get sunned all round.\"\r\n\r\nOf course, they never had lost their identity with\r\nus, so far as our rotation and revolution went: our\r\ninertia was theirs; all the fatal, Fly-Wheels had given\r\nthem was an additional motion in space of their own.\r\n\r\nThis was the last despatch before daylight of Sunday\r\nmorning; and the terrible snow-storm of March, sweeping\r\nour hemisphere, cut off our communication with them, both\r\nat Tamworth and No. 9, for several days.\r\n\r\nBut here was ample food for reflection.  Our friends\r\nwere in a world of their own, all thirty-seven of them\r\nwell, and it seemed they had two more little girls added\r\nto their number since they started.  They had plenty of\r\nvegetables to eat, with prospect of new tropical\r\nvarieties according to Dr. Darwin.  Rob. Shea was sure\r\nthat they carried up hens; he said he knew Mrs. Whitman\r\nhad several Middlesexes and Mrs. Leonard two or three\r\nBlack Spanish fowls, which had been given her by some\r\nfriends in Foxcroft.  Even if they had not yet had time\r\nenough for these to develop into Alderneys and venison,\r\nthey would not be without animal food.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen at last it cleared off, Haliburton had to\r\ntelegraph:  \"Repeat from 21\"; and this took all his\r\ncambric, though he had doubled his stock.  Orcutt replied\r\nthe next night:\r\n\r\n22. \"I can see your storms.  We have none.  When we\r\nwant to change climate we can walk in less than a minute\r\nfrom midsummer to the depth of winter.  But in the inside\r\nwe have eleven different temperatures, which do not\r\nchange.\"\r\n\r\nOn the whole there is a certain convenience in such\r\nan arrangement.  With No. 23 he went back to his story:--\r\n\r\nIt took us many days, one or two of our months, to\r\nadjust ourselves to our new condition.  Our greatest\r\ngrief is that we are not on the meridian.  Do you know\r\nwhy?\"\r\n\r\nLoyal George!  He was willing to exile himself and\r\nhis race from the most of mankind, if only the great\r\npurpose of his life could be fulfilled.  But his great\r\nregret was that it was not fulfilled.  He was not on the\r\nmeridian.  I did not know why.  But Haliburton, with\r\ninfinite labor, spelt out on the Flat,\r\n\r\nCYC.  PROJECT.  AD FIN.,\r\n\r\nby which he meant, \"See article Projectiles in the\r\nCyclopaedia at the end\"; and there indeed is the only\r\nexplanation to be given.  When you fire a shot, why\r\ndoes it ever go to the right or left of the plane in\r\nwhich it is projected?  Dr. Hutton ascribes it to a\r\nwhirling motion acquired by the bullet by friction\r\nwith the gun.  Euler thinks it due chiefly to the\r\nirregularity of the shape of the ball.  In our case the\r\nB. M. was regular enough.  But on one side, being\r\nwholly unprepared for flight, she was heavily stored\r\nwith pork and corn, while her other chambers had in\r\nsome of them heavy drifts of snow, and some only a few\r\nmen and women and hens.\r\n\r\nBefore Orcutt saw Haliburton's advice, he had sent us\r\n24 and 25.\r\n\r\n24. \"We have established a Sandemanian church, and\r\nBrannan preaches.  My son Edward and Alice Whitman are to\r\nbe married this evening.\"\r\n\r\nThis despatch unfortunately did not reach Haliburton,\r\nthough I got it.  So, all the happy pair received for our\r\nwedding-present was the advice to look in the Cyclopaedia\r\nat article Projectiles near the end.\r\n\r\n25 was:--\r\n\r\n\"We shall act `As You Like It' after the wedding.\r\nDead-head tickets for all of the old set who will come.\"\r\n\r\nActually, in one week's reunion we had come to\r\njoking.\r\n\r\nThe next night we got 26:\r\n\r\n\"Alice says she will not read the Cyclopaedia in the\r\nhoneymoon, but is much obliged to Mr. Haliburton for his\r\nadvice.\"\r\n\r\n\"How did she ever know it was I?\" wrote the matter-\r\nof-fact Haliburton to me.\r\n\r\n27. \"Alice wants to know if Mr. Haliburton will not\r\nsend here for some rags; says we have plenty, with little\r\nneed for clothes.\"\r\n\r\nAnd then despatches began to be more serious again.\r\nBrannan and Orcutt had failed in the great scheme for the\r\nlongitude, to which they had sacrificed their lives,--if,\r\nindeed, it were a sacrifice to retire with those they\r\nlove best to a world of their own.  But none the less did\r\nthey devote themselves, with the rare power of\r\nobservation they had, to the benefit of our world.  Thus,\r\nin 28:\r\n\r\n\"Your North Pole is an open ocean.  It was black,\r\nwhich we think means water, from August 1st to September\r\n29th.  Your South Pole is on an island bigger than New\r\nHolland.  Your Antarctic Continent is a great cluster of\r\nislands.\"\r\n\r\n29. \"Your Nyanzas are only two of a large group of\r\nAfrican lakes.  The green of Africa, where there is no\r\nwater, is wonderful at our distance.\"\r\n\r\n30. \"We have not the last numbers of `Foul Play.'\r\nTell us, in a word or two, how they got home.  We can see\r\nwhat we suppose their island was.\"\r\n\r\n31. \"We should like to know who proved Right in `He\r\nKnew He was Right.'\"\r\n\r\nThis was a good night's work, as they were then\r\ntelegraphing.  As soon as it cleared, Haliburton\r\ndisplayed,--\r\n\r\nBEST HOPES.  CARRIER DUCKS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis was Haliburton's masterpiece.  He had no room\r\nfor more, however, and was obliged to reserve for the\r\nnext day his answer to No. 31, which was simply,\r\n\r\nSHE.\r\n\r\nA real equinoctial now parted us for nearly a week,\r\nand at the end of that time they were so low in our\r\nnorthern horizon that we could not make out their\r\nsignals; we and they were obliged to wait till they had\r\npassed through two-thirds of their month before we could\r\ncommunicate again.  I used the time in speeding to No. 9.\r\nWe got a few carpenters together, and arranged on the\r\nFlat two long movable black platforms, which ran in and\r\nout on railroad-wheels on tracks, from under green\r\nplatforms; so that we could display one or both as we\r\nchose, and then withdraw them.  With this apparatus we\r\ncould give forty-five signals in a minute, corresponding\r\nto the line and dot of the telegraph; and thus could\r\ncompass some twenty letters in that time, and make out\r\nperhaps two hundred and fifty words in an hour.\r\nHaliburton thought that, with some improvements, he could\r\nsend one of Mr. Buchanan's messages up in thirty-seven\r\nworking-nights.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nINDEPENDENCE\r\n\r\nI own to a certain mortification in confessing that\r\nafter this interregnum, forced upon us by so long a\r\nperiod of non-intercourse, we never resumed precisely\r\nthe same constancy of communication as that which I\r\nhave tried to describe at the beginning.  The apology\r\nfor this benumbment, if I may so call it, will suggest\r\nitself to the thoughtful reader.\r\n\r\nIt is indeed astonishing to think that we so readily\r\naccept a position when we once understand it.  You buy a\r\nnew house.  You are fool enough to take out a staircase\r\nthat you may put in a bathing-room.  This will be done in\r\na fortnight, everybody tells you, and then everybody\r\nbegins.  Plumbers, masons, carpenters, plasterers,\r\nskimmers, bell-hangers, speaking-tube men, men who make\r\nfurnace-pipe, paper-hangers, men who scrape off the old\r\npaper, and other men who take off the old paint with\r\nalkali, gas men, city-water men, and painters begin.  To\r\nthem are joined a considerable number of furnace-men's\r\nassistants, stovepipe-men's assistants, mason's\r\nassistants, and hodmen who assist the assistants of the\r\nmasons, the furnace-men, and the pipe-men.  For a day or\r\ntwo these all take possession of the house and reduce it\r\nto chaos.  In the language of Scripture, they enter\r\nin and dwell there.  Compare, for the details, Matt. xii.\r\n45.  Then you revisit it at the end of the fortnight, and\r\nfind it in chaos, with the woman whom you employed to\r\nwash the attics the only person on the scene.  You ask\r\nher where the paper-hanger is; and she says he can do\r\nnothing because the plaster is not dry.  You ask why the\r\nplaster is not dry, and are told it is because the\r\nfurnace-man has not come.  You send for him, and he says\r\nhe did come, but the stove-pipe man was away.  You send\r\nfor him, and he says he lost a day in coming, but that\r\nthe mason had not cut the right hole in the chimney.  You\r\ngo and find the mason, and he says they are all fools,\r\nand that there is nothing in the house that need take two\r\ndays to finish.\r\n\r\nThen you curse, not the day in which you were born,\r\nbut the day in which bath-rooms were invented.  You say,\r\ntruly, that your father and mother, from whom you inherit\r\nevery moral and physical faculty you prize, never had a\r\nbath-room till they were past sixty, yet they thrived,\r\nand their children.  You sneak through back streets,\r\nfearful lest your friends shall ask you when your house\r\nwill be finished.  You are sunk in wretchedness, unable\r\neven to read your proofs accurately, far less able to\r\nattend the primary meetings of the party with which you\r\nvote, or to discharge any of the duties of a good\r\ncitizen.  Life is wholly embittered to you.\r\n\r\nYet, six weeks after, you sit before a soft-coal fire\r\nin your new house, with the feeling that you have always\r\nlived there.  You are not even grateful that you are\r\nthere.  You have forgotten the plumber's name; and if you\r\nmet in the street that nice carpenter that drove things\r\nthrough, you would just nod to him, and would not think\r\nof kissing him or embracing him.\r\n\r\nThus completely have you accepted the situation.\r\n\r\nLet me confess that the same experience is that with\r\nwhich, at this writing, I regard the BRICK MOON.  It is\r\nthere in ether.  I cannot keep it.  I cannot get it down.\r\nI cannot well go to it,--though possibly that might be\r\ndone, as you will see.  They are all very happy there,--\r\nmuch happier, as far as I can see, than if they lived in\r\nsixth floors in Paris, in lodgings in London, or even in\r\ntenement-houses in Phoenix Place, Boston.  There are\r\ndisadvantages attached to their position; but there are\r\nalso advantages.  And what most of all tends to our\r\naccepting the situation is, that there is \"nothing that\r\nwe can do about it,\" as Q. says, but to keep up our\r\ncorrespondence with them, and to express our sympathies.\r\n\r\nFor them, their responsibilities are reduced in\r\nsomewhat the same proportion as the gravitation which\r\nbinds them down,--I had almost said to earth,--which\r\nbinds them down to brick, I mean.  This decrease of\r\nresponsibility must make them as light-hearted as the\r\nloss of gravitation makes them light-bodied.\r\n\r\nOn which point I ask for a moment's attention.  And\r\nas these sheets leave my hand, an illustration turns up\r\nwhich well serves me.  It is the 23d of October.\r\nYesterday morning all wakeful women in New England were\r\nsure there was some one under the bed.  This is a certain\r\nsign of an earthquake.  And when we read the evening\r\nnewspapers, we were made sure there had been an\r\nearthquake.  What blessings the newspapers are,--and how\r\nmuch information they give us!  Well, they said it was\r\nnot very severe, here, but perhaps it was more severe\r\nelsewhere; hopes really arising in the editorial mind\r\nthat in some Caraccas or Lisbon all churches and the\r\ncathedral might have fallen.  I did not hope for that.\r\nBut I did have just the faintest feeling that IF--if\r\nif--it should prove that the world had blown up into six\r\nor eight pieces, and they had gone off into separate\r\norbits, life would be vastly easier for all of us, on\r\nwhichever bit we happened to be.\r\n\r\nThat thing has happened, they say, once.  Whenever\r\nthe big planet between Mars and Jupiter blew up, and\r\ndivided himself into one hundred and two or more\r\nasteroids, the people on each one only knew there had\r\nbeen an earthquake when and after they read their morning\r\njournals.  And then, all that they knew at first was that\r\ntelegraphic communication had ceased beyond--say two\r\nhundred miles.  Gradually people and despatches came in,\r\nwho said that they had parted company with some of the\r\nother islands and continents.  But, as I say, on each\r\npiece the people not only weighed much less, but were\r\nmuch lighter-hearted, had less responsibility.\r\n\r\nNow will you imagine the enthusiasm here, at Miss\r\nHale's school, when it should be announced that\r\ngeography, in future, would be confined to the study of\r\nthe region east of the Mississippi and west of the\r\nAtlantic,--the earth having parted at the seams so named.\r\nNo more study of Italian, German, French, or Sclavonic,--\r\nthe people speaking those languages being now in\r\ndifferent orbits or other worlds.  Imagine also the\r\nsuperior ease of the office-work of the A. B. C. F. M.\r\nand kindred societies, the duties of instruction and\r\ncivilizing, of evangelizing in general, being reduced\r\nwithin so much narrower bounds.  For you and me also, who\r\ncannot decide what Mr. Gladstone ought to do with the\r\nland tenure in Ireland, and who distress ourselves so\r\nmuch about it in conversation, what a satisfaction to\r\nknow that Great Britain is flung off with one rate of\r\nmovement, Ireland with another, and the Isle of Man with\r\nanother, into space, with no more chance of meeting again\r\nthan there is that you shall have the same hand at whist\r\nto-night that you had last night!  Even Victoria would\r\nsleep easier, and I am sure Mr. Gladstone would.\r\n\r\nThus, I say, were Orcutt's and Brannan's\r\nresponsibilities so diminished, that after the first I\r\nbegan to see that their contracted position had its\r\ndecided compensating ameliorations.\r\n\r\nIn these views, I need not say, the women of our\r\nlittle circle never shared.  After we got the new\r\ntelegraph arrangement in good running-order, I observed\r\nthat Polly and Annie Haliburton had many private\r\nconversations, and the secret came out one morning, when,\r\nrising early in the cabins, we men found they had\r\ndeserted us; and then, going in search of them, found\r\nthem running the signal boards in and out as rapidly as\r\nthey could, to tell Mrs. Brannan and the bride, Alice\r\nOrcutt, that flounces were worn an inch and a half\r\ndeeper, and that people trimmed now with harmonizing\r\ncolors and not with contrasts.  I did not say that I\r\nbelieved they wore fig-leaves in B. M., but that was my\r\nprivate impression.\r\n\r\nAfter all, it was hard to laugh at the girls, as\r\nthese ladies will be called, should they live to be as\r\nold as Helen was when she charmed the Trojan senate (that\r\nwas ninety-three, if Heyne be right in his calculations).\r\nIt was hard to laugh at them because this was simple\r\nbenevolence, and the same benevolence led to a much more\r\npractical suggestion when Polly came to me and told me\r\nshe had been putting up some baby things for little Io\r\nand Phoebe, and some playthings for the older children,\r\nand she thought we might \"send up a bundle.\"\r\n\r\nOf course we could.  There were the Flies still\r\nmoving! or we might go ourselves!\r\n\r\n[And here the reader must indulge me in a long\r\nparenthesis.  I beg him to bear me witness that I never\r\nmade one before.  This parenthesis is on the tense that\r\nI am obliged to use in sending to the press these\r\nminutes.  The reader observes that the last transactions\r\nmentioned happen in April and May, 1871.  Those to be\r\nnarrated are the sequence of those already told.\r\nSpeaking of them in 1870 with the coarse tenses of the\r\nEnglish language is very difficult.  One needs, for\r\naccuracy, a sure future, a second future, a paulo-post\r\nfuture, and a paulum-ante future, none of which does this\r\nlanguage have.  Failing this, one would be glad of an a-\r\norist,--tense without time,--if the grammarians will not\r\nswoon at hearing such language.  But the English tongue\r\nhath not that, either.  Doth the learned reader remember\r\nthat the Hebrew--language of history and prophecy--hath\r\nonly a past and a future tense, but hath no present?  Yet\r\nthat language succeeded tolerably in expressing the\r\npresent griefs or joys of David and of Solomon.  Bear\r\nwith me, then, O critic! if even in 1870 I use the so-\r\ncalled past tenses in narrating what remaineth of this\r\nhistory up to the summer of 1872.  End of the\r\nparenthesis.]\r\n\r\nOn careful consideration, however, no one volunteers\r\nto go.  To go, if you observe, would require that a man\r\nenvelop himself thickly in asbestos or some similar non-\r\nconducting substance, leap boldly on the rapid Flies, and\r\nso be shot through the earth's atmosphere in two seconds\r\nand a fraction, carrying with him all the time in a non-\r\nconducting receiver the condensed air he needed, and\r\nlanding quietly on B. M. by a precalculated orbit.  At\r\nthe bottom of our hearts I think we were all afraid.\r\nSome of us confessed to fear; others said, and said\r\ntruly, that the population of the Moon was already dense,\r\nand that it did not seem reasonable or worth while, on\r\nany account, to make it denser.  Nor has any movement\r\nbeen renewed for going.  But the plan of the bundle of\r\n\"things\" seemed more feasible, as the things would not\r\nrequire oxygen.  The only precaution seemed to be that\r\nwhich was necessary for protecting the parcel against\r\ncombustion as it shot through the earth's atmosphere.  We\r\nhad not asbestos enough.  It was at first proposed to\r\npack them all in one of Professor Horsford's safes.  But\r\nwhen I telegraphed this plan to Orcutt, he demurred.\r\nTheir atmosphere was but shallow, and with a little too\r\nmuch force the corner of the safe might knock a very bad\r\nhole in the surface of his world.  He said if we would\r\nsend up first a collection of things of no great weight,\r\nbut of considerable bulk, he would risk that, but he\r\nwould rather have no compact metals.\r\n\r\nI satisfied myself, therefore, with a plan which I\r\nstill think good.  Making the parcel up in heavy old\r\nwoollen carpets, and cording it with worsted cords, we\r\nwould case it in a carpet-bag larger than itself and fill\r\nin the interstice with dry sand, as our best non-\r\nconductor; cording this tightly again, we would renew the\r\nsame casing with more sand; and so continually offer\r\nsurfaces of sand and woollen, till we had five separate\r\nlayers between the parcel and the air.  Our calculation\r\nwas that a perceptible time  would be necessary for\r\nthe burning and disintegrating of each sand-bag.  If each\r\none, on the average, would stand two-fifths of a second,\r\nthe inner parcel would get through the earth's atmosphere\r\nunconsumed.  If, on the other hand, they lasted a little\r\nlonger, the bag, as it fell on B. M., would not be unduly\r\nheavy.  Of course we could take their night for the\r\nexperiment, so that we might be sure they should all be\r\nin bed and out of the way.\r\n\r\nWe had very funny and very merry times in selecting\r\nthings important enough and at the same time bulky and\r\nlight enough to be safe.  Alice and Bertha at once\r\ninsisted that there must be room for the children's\r\nplaythings.  They wanted to send the most approved of the\r\nold ones, and to add some new presents.  There was a\r\nwoolly sheep in particular, and a watering-pot that Rose\r\nhad given Fanny, about which there was some sentiment;\r\nboxes of dominos, packs of cards, magnetic fishes, bows\r\nand arrows, checker-boards and croquet sets.  Polly and\r\nAnnie were more considerate.  Down to Coleman and Company\r\nthey sent an order for pins, needles, hooks and eyes,\r\nbuttons, tapes, and I know not what essentials.  India-\r\nrubber shoes for the children Mrs. Haliburton insisted on\r\nsending.  Haliburton himself bought open-eye-shut-eye\r\ndolls, though I felt that wax had been, since Icarus's\r\ndays, the worst article in such an adventure.  For the\r\nbabies he had india-rubber rings: he had tin cows and\r\ncarved wooden lions for the bigger children, drawing-\r\ntools for those older yet, and a box of crochet tools for\r\nthe ladies.  For my part I piled in literature,--a set of\r\nmy own works, the Legislative Reports of the State of\r\nMaine, Jean Ingelow, as I said or intimated, and both\r\nvolumes of the \"Earthly Paradise.\"  All these were packed\r\nin sand, bagged and corded,--bagged, sanded and corded\r\nagain,--yet again and again,--five times.  Then the whole\r\nawaited Orcutt's orders and our calculations.\r\n\r\nAt last the moment came.  We had, at Orcutt's order,\r\nreduced the revolutions of the Flies to 7230, which was,\r\nas nearly as he knew, the speed on the fatal night.  We\r\nhad soaked the bag for near twelve hours, and, at the\r\nmoment agreed upon, rolled it on the Flies and saw it\r\nshot into the air.  It was so small that it went out of\r\nsight too soon for us to see it take fire.\r\n\r\nOf course we watched eagerly for signal time.  They\r\nwere all in bed on B. M. when we let fly.  But the\r\ndespatch was a sad disappointment.\r\n\r\n107. \"Nothing has come through but two croquet balls\r\nand a china horse.  But we shall send the boys hunting in\r\nthe bushes, and we may find more.\"\r\n\r\n108. \"Two Harpers and an Atlantic, badly singed.  But\r\nwe can read all but the parts which were most dry.\"\r\n\r\n109. \"We see many small articles revolving round us\r\nwhich may perhaps fall in.\"\r\n\r\nThey never did fall in, however.  The truth was that\r\nall the bags had burned through.  The sand, I suppose,\r\nwent to its place, wherever that was.  And all the other\r\nthings in our bundle became little asteroids or aerolites\r\nin orbits of their own, except a well-disposed score or\r\ntwo, which persevered far enough to get within the\r\nattraction of Brick Moon and to take to revolving there,\r\nnot having hit quite square, as the croquet balls did.\r\nThey had five volumes of the \"Congressional Globe\"\r\nwhirling round like bats within a hundred feet of their\r\nheads.  Another body, which I am afraid was \"The Ingham\r\nPapers,\" flew a little higher, not quite so heavy.  Then\r\nthere was an absurd procession of the woolly sheep, a\r\nchina cow, a pair of india-rubbers, a lobster Haliburton\r\nhad chosen to send, a wooden lion, the wax doll, a\r\nSalter's balance, the \"New York Observer,\" the bow and\r\narrows, a Nuremberg nanny-goat, Rose's watering-pot, and\r\nthe magnetic fishes, which gravely circled round and\r\nround them slowly and made the petty zodiac of their\r\npetty world.\r\n\r\nWe have never sent another parcel since, but we\r\nprobably shall at Christmas, gauging the Flies perhaps to\r\none revolution more.  The truth is, that although we have\r\nnever stated to each other in words our difference of\r\nopinion or feeling, there is a difference of habit of\r\nthought in our little circle as to the position which the\r\nB. M. holds.  Somewhat similar is the difference of\r\nhabit of thought in which different statesmen of\r\nEngland regard their colonies.\r\n\r\nIs B. M. a part of our world, or is it not?  Should\r\nits inhabitants be encouraged to maintain their\r\nconnections with us, or is it better for them to \"accept\r\nthe situation\" and gradually wean themselves from us and\r\nfrom our affairs?  It would be idle to determine this\r\nquestion in the abstract: it is perhaps idle to decide\r\nany question of casuistry in the abstract.  But, in\r\npractice, there are constantly arising questions which\r\nreally require some decision of this abstract problem for\r\ntheir solution.\r\n\r\nFor instance, when that terrible breach occurred in\r\nthe Sandemanian church, which parted it into the Old\r\nSchool and New School parties, Haliburton thought it very\r\nimportant that Brannan and Orcutt and the church in B. M.\r\nunder Brannan's ministry should give in their adhesion to\r\nour side.  Their church would count one more in our\r\nregistry, and the weight of its influence would not be\r\nlost.  He therefore spent eight or nine days in\r\ntelegraphing, from the early proofs, a copy of the\r\naddress of the Chautauqua Synod to Brannan, and asked\r\nBrannan if he were not willing to have his name signed to\r\nit when it was printed.  And the only thing which\r\nHaliburton takes sorely in the whole experience of the\r\nBrick Moon, from the beginning, is that neither Orcutt\r\nnor Brannan has ever sent one word of acknowledgment of\r\nthe despatch.  Once, when Haliburton was very low-\r\nspirited, I heard him even say that he believed they had\r\nnever read a word of it, and that he thought he and Rob.\r\nShea had had their labor for their pains in running the\r\nsignals out and in.\r\n\r\nThen he felt quite sure that they would have to\r\nestablish civil government there.  So he made up an\r\nexcellent collection of books,--De Lolme on the British\r\nConstitution; Montesquieu on Laws; Story, Kent, John\r\nAdams, and all the authorities here; with ten copies of\r\nhis own address delivered before the Young Men's Mutual\r\nImprovement Society of Podunk, on the \"Abnormal Truths of\r\nSocial Order.\"  He telegraphed to know what night he\r\nshould send them, and Orcutt replied:--\r\n\r\n129. \"Go to thunder with your old law-books.  We have\r\nnot had a primary meeting nor a justice court since we\r\nhave been here, and, D. V., we never will have.\"\r\n\r\nHaliburton says this is as bad as the state of things\r\nin Kansas, when, because Frank Pierce would not give them\r\nany judges or laws to their mind, they lived a year or so\r\nwithout any.  Orcutt added in his next despatch:--\r\n\r\n130. \"Have not you any new novels?  Send up Scribe\r\nand the `Arabian Nights' and `Robinson Crusoe' and the\r\n`Three Guardsmen,' and Mrs. Whitney's books.  We have\r\nThackeray and Miss Austen.\"\r\n\r\nWhen he read this, Haliburton felt as if they\r\nwere not only light-footed but light-headed.  And he\r\nconsulted me quite seriously as to telegraphing to them\r\n\"Pycroft's Course of Reading.\"  I coaxed him out of that,\r\nand he satisfied himself with a serious expostulation\r\nwith George as to the way in which their young folks\r\nwould grow up.  George replied by telegraphing Brannan's\r\nlast sermon, I Thessalonians iv. II.  The sermon had\r\nfour heads, must have occupied an hour and a half in\r\ndelivery, and took five nights to telegraph.  I had\r\nanother engagement, so that Haliburton had to sit it all\r\nout with his eye to Shubael, and he has never entered on\r\nthat line of discussion again.  It was as well, perhaps,\r\nthat he got enough of it.\r\n\r\nThe women have never had any misunderstandings.  When\r\nwe had received two or three hundred despatches from B.\r\nM., Annie Haliburton came to me and said, in that pretty\r\nway of hers, that she thought they had a right to their\r\nturn again.  She said this lore about the Albert Nyanza\r\nand the North Pole was all very well, but, for her part,\r\nshe wanted to know how they lived, what they did, and\r\nwhat they talked about, whether they took summer\r\njourneys, and how and what was the form of society where\r\nthirty-seven people lived in such close quarters.  This\r\nabout \"the form of society\" was merely wool pulled over\r\nmy eyes.  So she said she thought her husband and I had\r\nbetter go off to the Biennial Convention at Assampink, as\r\nshe knew we wanted to do, and she and Bridget and\r\nPolly and Cordelia would watch for the signals, and would\r\nmake the replies.  She thought they would get on better\r\nif we were out of the way.\r\n\r\nSo we went to the convention, as she called it, which\r\nwas really not properly a convention, but the Forty-fifth\r\nBiennial General Synod, and we left the girls to their\r\nown sweet way.\r\n\r\nShall I confess that they kept no record of their own\r\nsignals, and did not remember very accurately what they\r\nwere?  \"I was not going to keep a string of `says I's'\r\nand `says she's,'\" said Polly, boldly.  \"it shall not be\r\nwritten on my tomb that I have left more annals for\r\npeople to file or study or bind or dust or catalogue.\"\r\nBut they told us that they had begun by asking the\r\n\"bricks\" if they remembered what Maria Theresa said to\r\nher ladies-in-waiting.[1]  Quicker than any signal had\r\never been answered, George Orcutt's party replied from\r\nthe Moon, \"We hear, and we obey.\"  Then the women-kind\r\nhad it all to themselves.  The brick-women explained at\r\nonce to our girls that they had sent their men round to\r\nthe other side to cut ice, and that they were manning the\r\ntelescope, and running the signals for themselves, and\r\nthat they could have a nice talk without any bother about\r\nthe law-books or the magnetic pole.  As I say, I do\r\nnot know what questions Polly and Annie put; but--to give\r\nthem their due--they had put on paper a coherent record\r\nof the results arrived at in the answers; though, what\r\nwere the numbers of the despatches, or in what order they\r\ncame, I do not know; for the session of the synod kept us\r\nat Assampink for two or three weeks\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]  Maria Theresa's husband, Francis, Duke of\r\nTuscany, was hanging about loose one day, and the\r\nEmpress, who had got a little tired, said to the maids of\r\nhonor, \"Girls, whenever you marry, take care and choose\r\na husband who has something to do outside of the house.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. Brannan was the spokesman.  \"We tried a good\r\nmany experiments about day and night.  It was very funny\r\nat first not to know when it would be light and when\r\ndark, for really the names day and night do not express\r\na great deal for us.  Of course the pendulum clocks all\r\nwent wrong till the men got them overhauled, and I think\r\nwatches and clocks both will soon go out of fashion.  But\r\nwe have settled down on much the old hours, getting up,\r\nwithout reference to daylight, by our great gong, at your\r\neight o'clock.  But when the eclipse season comes, we\r\nvary from that for signalling.\r\n\r\n\"We still make separate families, and Alice's is the\r\nseventh.  We tried hotel life and we liked it, for there\r\nhas never been the first quarrel here.  You can't quarrel\r\nhere, where you are never sick, never tired, and need not\r\nbe ever hungry.  But we were satisfied that it was nicer\r\nfor the children and for all round to live separately and\r\ncome together at parties, to church, at signal time, and\r\nso on.  We had something to say then, something to teach,\r\nand something to learn.\r\n\r\n\"Since the carices developed so nicely into flax, we\r\nhave had one great comfort, which we had lost before, in\r\nbeing able to make and use paper.  We have had great fun,\r\nand we think the children have made great improvement in\r\nwriting novels for the Union.  The Union is the old Union\r\nfor Christian work that we had in dear old No. 9.  We\r\nhave two serial novels going on, one called `Diana of\r\nCarrotook,' and the other called `Ups and Downs'; the\r\nfirst by Levi Ross, and the other by my Blanche.  They\r\nare really very good, and I wish we could send them to\r\nyou.  But they would not be worth despatching.\r\n\r\n\"We get up at eight; dress, and fix up at home; a\r\nsniff of air, as people choose; breakfast; and then we\r\nmeet for prayers outside.  Where we meet depends on the\r\ntemperature; for we can choose any temperature we want,\r\nfrom boiling water down, which is convenient.  After\r\nprayers an hour's talk, lounging, walking, and so on; no\r\nflirting, but a favorite time with the young folks.\r\n\r\n\"Then comes work.  Three hours' head-work is the\r\nmaximum in that line.  Of women's work, as in all worlds,\r\nthere are twenty-four in one of your days, but for my\r\npart I like it.  Farmers and carpenters have their own\r\nlaws, as the light serves and the seasons.  Dinner is\r\nseven hours after breakfast began; always an hour long,\r\nas breakfast was.  Then every human being sleeps for an\r\nhour.  Big gong again, and we ride, walk, swim,\r\ntelegraph, or what not, as the case may be.  We have\r\nno horses yet, but the Shanghaes are coming up into very\r\ngood dodos and ostriches, quite big enough for a trot for\r\nthe children.\r\n\r\n\"Only two persons of a family take tea at home.  The\r\nrest always go out to tea without invitation.  At 8 P. M.\r\nbig gong again, and we meet in `Grace,' which is the\r\nprettiest hall, church, concert-room, that you ever saw.\r\nWe have singing, lectures, theatre, dancing, talk, or\r\nwhat the mistress of the night determines, till the\r\ncurfew sounds at ten, and then we all go home.  Evening\r\nprayers are in the separate households, and every one is\r\nin bed by midnight.  The only law on the statute-book is\r\nthat every one shall sleep nine hours out of every\r\ntwenty-four.\r\n\r\n\"Only one thing interrupts this general order.  Three\r\ntaps on the gong means `telegraph,' and then, I tell you,\r\nwe are all on hand.\r\n\r\n\"You cannot think how quickly the days and years go\r\nby!\"\r\n\r\nOf course, however, as I said, this could not last.\r\nWe could not subdue our world and be spending all our\r\ntime in telegraphing our dear B. M.  Could it be\r\npossible--perhaps it was possible--that they there had\r\nsomething else to think of and to do besides attending to\r\nour affairs?  Certainly their indifference to Grant's\r\nfourth Proclamation, and to Mr. Fish's celebrated\r\nprotocol in the Tahiti business, looked that way.  Could\r\nit be that that little witch of a Belle Brannan really\r\ncared more for their performance of \"Midsummer\r\nNight's Dream,\" or her father's birthday, than she cared\r\nfor that pleasant little account I telegraphed up to all\r\nthe children, of the way we went to muster when we were\r\nboys together?  Ah well!  I ought not to have supposed\r\nthat all worlds were like this old world.  Indeed, I\r\noften say this is the queerest world I ever knew.\r\nPerhaps theirs is not so queer, and it is I who am the\r\noddity.\r\n\r\nOf course it could not last.  We just arranged\r\ncorrespondence days, when we would send to them, and they\r\nto us.  I was meanwhile turned out from my place at\r\nTamworth Observatory.  Not but I did my work well, and\r\nPolly hers.  The observer's room was a miracle of\r\nneatness.  The children were kept in the basement.\r\nVisitors were received with great courtesy; and all the\r\nfees were sent to the treasurer; he got three dollars and\r\neleven cents one summer,--that was the year General Grant\r\ncame there; and that was the largest amount that they\r\never received from any source but begging.  I was not\r\nunfaithful to my trust.  Nor was it for such infidelity\r\nthat I was removed.  No!  But it was discovered that I\r\nwas a Sandemanian; a Glassite, as in derision I was\r\ncalled.  The annual meeting of the trustees came round.\r\nThere was a large Mechanics' Fair in Tamworth at the\r\ntime, and an Agricultural Convention.  There was no\r\nhorse-race at the convention, but there were two\r\ncompetitive examinations in which running horses\r\ncompeted with each other, and trotting horses\r\ncompeted with each other, and five thousand dollars was\r\ngiven to the best runner and the best trotter.  These\r\ncauses drew all the trustees together.  The Rev. Cephas\r\nPhilpotts presided.  His doctrines with regard to free\r\nagency were considered much more sound than mine.  He\r\ntook the chair,--in that pretty observatory parlor, which\r\nPolly had made so bright with smilax and ivy.  Of course\r\nI took no chair; I waited, as a janitor should, at the\r\ndoor.  Then a brief address.  Dr. Philpotts trusted that\r\nthe observatory might always be administered in the\r\ninterests of science, of true science; of that science\r\nwhich rightly distinguishes between unlicensed liberty\r\nand true freedom; between the unrestrained volition and\r\nthe freedom of the will.  He became eloquent, he became\r\nnoisy.  He sat down.  Then three other men spoke, on\r\nsimilar subjects.  Then the executive committee which had\r\nappointed me was dismissed with thanks.  Then a new\r\nexecutive committee was chosen, with Dr. Philpotts at the\r\nhead.  The next day I was discharged.  And the next week\r\nthe Philpotts family moved into the observatory, and\r\ntheir second girl now takes care of the instruments.\r\n\r\nI returned to the cure of souls and to healing the\r\nhurt of my people.  On observation days somebody runs\r\ndown to No. 9, and by means of Shubael communicates with\r\nB. M.  We love them, and they love us all the same.\r\n\r\nNor do we grieve for them as we did.  Coming home\r\nfrom Pigeon Cove in October with those nice Wadsworth\r\npeople, we fell to talking as to the why and wherefore of\r\nthe summer life we had led.  How was it that it was so\r\ncharming?  And why were we a little loath to come back to\r\nmore comfortable surroundings?  \"I hate the school,\" said\r\nGeorge Wadsworth.  \"I hate the making calls,\" said his\r\nmother.  \"I hate the office hour,\" said her poor husband;\r\n\"if there were only a dozen I would not mind, but\r\nseventeen hundred thousand in sixty minutes is too many.\"\r\nSo that led to asking how many of us there had been at\r\nPigeon Cove.  The children counted up all the six\r\nfamilies,--the Haliburtons, the Wadsworths, the\r\nPontefracts, the Midges, the Hayeses, and the Inghams,\r\nand the two good-natured girls, thirty-seven in all,--and\r\nthe two babies born this summer.  \"Really,\" said Mrs.\r\nWadsworth, \"I have not spoken to a human being besides\r\nthese since June; and what is more, Mrs. Ingham, I have\r\nnot wanted to.  We have really lived in a little world of\r\nour own.\"\r\n\r\n\"World of our own!\"  Polly fairly jumped from her\r\nseat, to Mrs. Wadsworth's wonder.  So we had--lived in a\r\nworld of our own.  Polly reads no newspaper since the\r\n\"Sandemanian\" was merged.  She has a letter or two tumble\r\nin sometimes, but not many; and the truth was that she\r\nhad been more secluded from General Grant and Mr.\r\nGladstone and the Khedive, and the rest of the\r\nimportant people, than had Brannan or Ross or any of\r\nthem!\r\n\r\nAnd it had been the happiest summer she had ever\r\nknown.\r\n\r\nCan it be possible that all human sympathies can\r\nthrive, and all human powers be exercised, and all human\r\njoys increase, if we live with all our might with the\r\nthirty or forty people next to us, telegraphing kindly to\r\nall other people, to be sure?  Can it be possible that\r\nour passion for large cities, and large parties, and\r\nlarge theatres, and large churches, develops no faith nor\r\nhope nor love which would not find aliment and exercise\r\nin a little \"world of our own\"?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCRUSOE IN NEW YORK\r\n\r\nPART I\r\n\r\nI was born in the year 1842, in the city of New York,\r\nof a good family, though not of that country, my father\r\nbeing a foreigner of Bremen, who settled first in\r\nEngland.  He got a good estate by merchandise, and\r\nafterward lived at New York.  But first he had married\r\nmy mother, whose relations were named Robinson, a very\r\ngood family in her country--and from them I was named.\r\n\r\nMy father died before I can remember--at least, I\r\nbelieve so.  For, although I sometimes figure to myself\r\na grave, elderly man, thickset and wearing a broad-\r\nbrimmed hat, holding me between his knees and advising me\r\nseriously, I cannot say really whether this were my\r\nfather or no; or, rather, whether this is really some one\r\nI remember or no.  For my mother, with whom I have lived\r\nalone much of my life, as the reader will see, has talked\r\nto me of my father so much, and has described him to me\r\nso faithfully, that I cannot tell but it is her\r\ndescription of him that I recollect so easily.  And\r\nso, as I say, I cannot tell whether I remember him or no.\r\n\r\nHe never lost his German notions, and perhaps they\r\ngained in England some new force as to the way in which\r\nboys should be bred.  At least, for myself, I know that\r\nhe left to my mother strict charge that I should be bound\r\n'prentice to a carpenter as soon as I was turned of\r\nfourteen.  I have often heard her say that this was the\r\nlast thing he spoke to her of when he was dying; and with\r\nthe tears in her eyes, she promised him it should be so.\r\nAnd though it cost her a world of trouble--so changed\r\nwere times and customs--to find an old-fashioned master\r\nwho would take me for an apprentice, she was as good as\r\nher word.\r\n\r\nI should like to tell the story of my apprenticeship,\r\nif I supposed the reader cared as much about it as I do;\r\nbut I must rather come to that part of my life which is\r\nremarkable, than hold to that which is more like the life\r\nof many other boys.  My father's property was lost or was\r\nwasted, I know not how, so that my poor mother had but a\r\nhard time of it; and when I was just turned of twenty-one\r\nand was free of my apprenticeship, she had but little to\r\nlive upon but what I could bring home, and what she could\r\nearn by her needle.  This was no grief to me, for I was\r\nfond of my trade, and I had learned it well.  My old\r\nmaster was fond of me, and would trust me with work of a\r\ngood deal of responsibility.  I neither drank nor\r\nsmoked, nor was I over-fond of the amusements which took\r\nup a good deal of the time of my fellow-workmen.  I was\r\nmost pleased when, on pay-day, I could carry home to my\r\nmother ten, fifteen, or even twenty dollars--could throw\r\nit into her lap, and kiss her and make her kiss me.\r\n\r\n\"Here is the oil for the lamp, my darling,\" I would\r\nsay; or, \"Here is the grease for the wheels\"; or, \"Now\r\nyou must give me white sugar twice a day.\"  She was a\r\ngood manager, and she made both ends meet very well.\r\n\r\nI had no thought of leaving my master when my\r\napprenticeship was over, nor had he any thought of\r\nletting me go.  We understood each other well, he liked\r\nme and I liked him.  He knew that he had in me one man\r\nwho was not afraid of work, as he would say, and who\r\nwould not shirk it.  And so, indeed, he would often put\r\nme in charge of parties of workmen who were much older\r\nthan I was.\r\n\r\nSo it was that it happened, perhaps some months after\r\nI had become a journeyman, that he told me to take a gang\r\nof men, whom he named, and to go quite up-town in the\r\ncity, to put a close wooden fence around a vacant lot of\r\nland there.  One of his regular employers had come to\r\nhim, to say that this lot of land was to be enclosed, and\r\nthe work was to be done by him.  He had sent round the\r\nlumber, and he told me that I would find it on the\r\nground.  He gave me, in writing, the general\r\ndirections by which the fence was ordered, and told me to\r\nuse my best judgment in carrying them out.  \"Only take\r\ncare,\" said he, \"that you do it as well as if I was there\r\nmyself.  Do not be in a hurry, and be sure your work\r\nstands.\"\r\n\r\nI was well pleased to be left thus to my own\r\njudgment.  I had no fear of failing to do the job well,\r\nor of displeasing my old master or his employer.  If I\r\nhad any doubts, they were about the men who were to work\r\nunder my lead, whom I did not rate at all equally; and,\r\nif I could have had my pick, I should have thrown out\r\nsome of the more sulky and lazy of them, and should have\r\nchosen from the other hands.  But youngsters must not be\r\nchoosers when they are on their first commissions.\r\n\r\nI had my party well at work, with some laborers whom\r\nwe had hired to dig our post-holes, when a white-haired\r\nold man, with gold spectacles and a broad-brimmed hat,\r\nalighted from a cab upon the sidewalk, watched the men\r\nfor a minute at their work, and then accosted me.  I knew\r\nhim perfectly, though of course he did not remember me.\r\nHe was, in fact, my employer in this very job, for he was\r\nold Mark Henry, a Quaker gentleman of Philadelphia, who\r\nwas guardian of the infant heirs who owned this block of\r\nland which we were enclosing.  My master did all the\r\ncarpenter's work in the New York houses which Mark Henry\r\nor any of his wards owned, and I had often seen him\r\nat the shop in consultation.  I turned to him and\r\nexplained to him the plans for the work.  We had already\r\nsome of the joists cut, which were to make the posts to\r\nour fence.  The old man measured them with his cane, and\r\nsaid he thought they would not be long enough.\r\n\r\nI explained to him that the fence was to be eight\r\nfeet high, and that these were quite long enough for\r\nthat.\r\n\r\n\"I know,\" he said, \"I know, my young friend, that my\r\norder was for a fence eight feet high, but I do not think\r\nthat will do.\"\r\n\r\nWith some surprise I showed him, by a \"ten-foot\r\npole,\" how high the fence would come.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, my young friend, I see, I see.  But I tell\r\nthee, every beggar's brat in the ward will be over thy\r\nfence before it has been built a week, and there will be\r\nI know not what devices of Satan carried on in the\r\ninside.  All the junk from the North River will be hidden\r\nthere, and I shall be in luck if some stolen trunk, nay,\r\nsome dead man's body, is not stowed away there.  Ah, my\r\nyoung friend, if thee is ever unhappy enough to own a\r\nvacant lot in the city, thee will know much that thee\r\ndoes not know now of the exceeding sinfulness of sin.\r\nThee will know of trials of the spirit and of the temper\r\nthat thee has never yet experienced.\"\r\n\r\nI said I thought this was probable, but I thought\r\ninwardly that I would gladly be tried that way.  The old\r\nman went on:--\r\n\r\n\"I said eight feet to friend Silas, but thee may say\r\nto him that I have thought better of it, and that I have\r\nordered thee to make the fence ten feet high.  Thee may\r\nsay that I am now going to Philadelphia, but that I will\r\nwrite to him my order when I arrive.  Meanwhile thee will\r\ngo on with the fence as I bid thee.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so the old man entered his cab again and rode\r\naway.\r\n\r\nI amused myself at his notion, for I knew very well\r\nthat the street-boys and other loafers would storm his\r\nten-foot wall as readily as they would have stormed the\r\nMalakoff or the Redan, had they supposed there was\r\nanything to gain by doing it.  I had, of course, to\r\ncondemn some of my posts, which were already cut, or to\r\nwork them in to other parts of the fence.  My order for\r\nspruce boards was to be enlarged by twenty per cent by\r\nthe old man's direction, and this, as it happened, led to\r\na new arrangement of my piles of lumber on my vacant\r\nland.\r\n\r\nAnd all this it was which set me to thinking that\r\nnight, as I looked on the work, that I might attempt\r\nanother enterprise, which, as it proved, lasted me for\r\nyears, and which I am now going to describe.\r\n\r\nI had worked diligently with the men to set up some\r\nfifty feet of the fence where it parted us from an alley-\r\nway, for I wanted a chance to dry some of the boards,\r\nwhich had just been hauled from a raft in the North\r\nRiver.  The truckmen had delivered them helter-\r\nskelter, and they lay, still soaking, above each other on\r\nour vacant lot.\r\n\r\nWe turned all our force on this first piece of fence,\r\nand had so much of it done that, by calling off the men\r\njust before sundown, I was able to set up all the wet\r\nboards, each with one end resting on the fence and the\r\nother on the ground, so that they took the air on both\r\nsides, and would dry more quickly.  Of course this left\r\na long, dark tunnel underneath.\r\n\r\nAs the other hands gathered up their tools and made\r\nready to go, a fellow named McLoughlin, who had gone out\r\nwith one of the three months' regiments not long before,\r\nsaid:--\r\n\r\n\"I would not be sorry to sleep there.  I have slept\r\nin many a worse place than that in Dixie\"; and on that he\r\nwent away, leaving me to make some measurements which I\r\nneeded the next day.  But what he said rested in my mind,\r\nand, as it happened, directed the next twelve years of my\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nWhy should not I live here?  How often my mother had\r\nsaid that if she had only a house of her own she should\r\nbe perfectly happy!  Why should not we have a house of\r\nour own here, just as comfortable as if we had gone a\r\nthousand miles out on the prairie to build it, and a\r\ngreat deal nearer to the book-stores, to the good music,\r\nto her old friends, and to my good wages?  We had talked\r\na thousand times of moving together to Kansas, where I\r\nwas to build a little hut for her, and we were to be\r\nvery happy together.  But why not do as the minister had\r\nbidden us only the last Sunday--seize on to-day, and take\r\nwhat Providence offered now?\r\n\r\nI must acknowledge that the thought of paying any\r\nground rent to old Mr. Henry did not occur to me then--\r\nno, nor for years afterward.  On the other hand, all that\r\nI thought of was this,--that here was as good a chance as\r\nthere was in Kansas to live without rent, and that rent\r\nhad been, was still, and was likely to be my bugbear,\r\nunless I hit on some such scheme as this for abating it.\r\n\r\nThe plan, to be short, filled my mind.  There was\r\nnothing in the way of house-building which I shrank from\r\nnow, for, in learning my trade, I had won my Aladdin's\r\nlamp, and I could build my mother a palace, if she had\r\nneeded one.  Pleased with my fancy, before it was dark I\r\nhad explored my principality from every corner, and\r\nlearned all its capabilities.\r\n\r\nThe lot was an oblong, nearly three times as long as\r\nit was wide.  On the west side, which was one of the\r\nshort sides, it faced what I will call the Ninety-ninth\r\nAvenue, and on the south side, what I will call Fernando\r\nStreet, though really it was one of the cross-streets\r\nwith numbers.  Running to the east it came to a narrow\r\npassage-way which had been reserved for the accommodation\r\nof the rear of a church which fronted on the street just\r\nnorth of us.  Our back line was also the back line of the\r\nyards of the houses on the same street, but on our\r\nnortheast corner the church ran back as far as the back\r\nline of both houses and yards, and its high brick wall--\r\nnearly fifty feet high--took the place there of the ten-\r\nfoot brick wall, surmounted by bottle-glass, which made\r\ntheir rear defence.\r\n\r\nThe moment my mind was turned to the matter, I saw\r\nthat in the rear of the church there was a corner which\r\nlay warmly and pleasantly to the southern and western\r\nsun, which was still out of eye-shot from the street,\r\npleasantly removed from the avenue passing, and only\r\nliable to inspection, indeed, from the dwelling-houses on\r\nthe opposite side of our street,--houses which, at this\r\nmoment, were not quite finished, though they would be\r\noccupied soon.\r\n\r\nIf, therefore, I could hit on some way of screening\r\nmy mother's castle from them--for a castle I called it\r\nfrom the first moment, though it was to be much more like\r\na cottage--I need fear no observation from other\r\nquarters; for the avenue was broad, and on the other side\r\nfrom us there was a range of low, rambling buildings--an\r\nengine-house and a long liquor-saloon were two--which had\r\nbut one story.  Most of them bad been built, I suppose,\r\nonly to earn something for the land while it was growing\r\nvaluable.  The church had no windows in the rear, and\r\nthat protected my castle--which was, indeed, still in the\r\nair--from all observation on that side.\r\n\r\nI told my mother nothing of all this when I went\r\nhome.  But I did tell her that I had some calculations to\r\nmake for my work, and that was enough.  She went on,\r\nsweet soul! without speaking a word, with her knitting\r\nand her sewing at her end of the table, only getting up\r\nto throw a cloth over her parrot's cage when he was\r\nnoisy; and I sat at my end of the table, at work over my\r\nfigures, as silent as if I had been on a desert island.\r\n\r\nBefore bedtime I had quite satisfied myself with the\r\nplan of a very pretty little house which would come quite\r\nwithin our space, our means, and our shelter.  There was\r\na little passage which ran quite across from east to\r\nwest.  On the church side of this there was my mother's\r\nkitchen, which was to be what I fondly marked the\r\n\"common-room.\"  This was quite long from east to west,\r\nand not more than half as long the other way.  But on the\r\neast side, where I could have no windows, I cut off, on\r\nits whole width, a deep closet; and this proved a very\r\nfortunate thing afterward, as you shall see.  On the west\r\nside I made one large square window, and there was, of\r\ncourse, a door into the passage.\r\n\r\nOn the south side of the passage I made three rooms,\r\neach narrow and long.  The two outside rooms I meant to\r\nlight from the top.  Whether I would put any skylight\r\ninto the room between them, I was not quite so certain;\r\nI did not expect visitors in my new house, so I did not\r\nmark it a \"guest-room \" in the plan.  But I thought\r\nof it as a store-room, and as such, indeed, for many\r\nyears we used it; though at last I found it more\r\nconvenient to cut a sky-light in the roof there also.\r\nBut I am getting before my story.\r\n\r\nBefore I had gone to bed that night I had made a\r\ncareful estimate as to how much lumber I should need, of\r\ndifferent kinds, for my little house; for I had, of\r\ncourse, no right to use my master's lumber nor Mr.\r\nHenry's; nor had I any thought of doing so.  I made out\r\nan estimate that would be quite full, for shingles, for\r\nclapboards, white pine for my floors and finish,--for I\r\nmeant to make a good job of it if I made any,--and for\r\nlaths for the inside work.  I made another list of the\r\nlocks, hinges, window furniture and other hardware I\r\nshould need; but for this I cared less, as I need not\r\norder them so soon.  I could scarcely refrain from\r\nshowing my plan to my mother, so snug and comfortable did\r\nit look already; but I had already determined that the\r\n\"city house\" should be a present to her on her next\r\nbirthday, and that till then I would keep it a secret\r\nfrom her, as from all the world; so I refrained.\r\n\r\nThe next morning I told my master what the old Quaker\r\nhad directed about the fence, and I took his order for\r\nthe new lumber we should need to raise the height as was\r\nproposed.  At the same time I told him that we were all\r\nannoyed at the need of carrying our tools back and forth,\r\nand because we could only take the nails for one\r\nday's use; and that, if he were willing, I had a mind to\r\nrisk an old chest I had with the nails in it and a few\r\ntools, which I thought I could so hide that the wharf-\r\nrats and other loafers should not discover it.  He told\r\nme to do as I pleased, that he would risk the nails if I\r\nwould risk my tools; and so, by borrowing what we call a\r\nhand-cart for a few days, I was able to take up my own\r\nlittle things to the lot without his asking any other\r\nquestions, or without exciting the curiosity of\r\nMcLoughlin or any other of the men.  Of course, he would\r\nhave sent up in the shop-wagon anything we needed; but it\r\nwas far out of the way, and nobody wanted to drive the\r\nteam back at night if we could do without.  And so, as\r\nnight came on, I left the men at their work, and having\r\nloaded my hand-cart with a small chest I had, I took that\r\ninto the alley-way of which I told you before, carried my\r\nbox of tools into the corner between the church and our\r\nfence, under the boards which we had set up that day, and\r\ncovered it heavily, with McLoughlin's help, with joists\r\nand boards, so that no light work would remove them, if,\r\nindeed, any wanderer of the night suspected that the box\r\nwas there.  I took the hand-cart out into the alley-way\r\nand  chained it, first by the wheel and then by the\r\nhandle, in two staples which I drove there.  I had\r\nanother purpose in this, as you shall see; but most of\r\nall, I wanted to test both the police and the\r\nknavishness of the neighborhood by seeing if the\r\nhand-cart were there in the morning.\r\n\r\nTo my great joy it was, and to my greater joy it\r\nremained there unmolested all the rest of the week in\r\nwhich we worked there.  For my master, who never came\r\nnear us himself, increased our force for us on the third\r\nday, so that at the end of the week, or Saturday night,\r\nthe job was nearly done, and well done, too.\r\n\r\nOn the third day I had taken the precaution to throw\r\nout in the inside of our enclosure a sort of open fence,\r\non which I could put the wet boards to dry, which at\r\nfirst I had placed on our side fence.  I told McLoughlin,\r\nwhat was true enough, that the south sun was better for\r\nthem than the sun from the west.  So I ran out what I may\r\ncall a screen thirty-five feet from the church, and\r\nparallel with it, on which I set up these boards to dry,\r\nand to my great joy I saw that they would wholly protect\r\nthe roof of my little house from any observation from the\r\nhouses the other side of the way while the workmen were\r\nat work, or even after they were inhabited.\r\n\r\nThere was not one of the workmen with me who had\r\nforethought enough or care for our master's interest to\r\nask whose boards those were which we left there, or why\r\nwe left them there.  Indeed, they knew the next Monday\r\nthat I went up with the Swede, to bring back such lumber\r\nwas we did not use, and none of them knew or cared how\r\nmuch we left there.\r\n\r\nFor me, I was only eager to get to work, and that day\r\nseemed very long to me.  But that Monday afternoon I\r\nasked my master if I might have the team again for my own\r\nuse for an hour or so, to move some stuff of mine and my\r\nmother's, and he gave it to me readily.\r\n\r\nI had then only to drive up-town to a friendly\r\nlumberman's, where my own stuff was already lying waiting\r\nfor me to load up, with the assistance of the workmen\r\nthere, and to drive as quickly as I could into the church\r\nalley.  Here I looked around, and seeing a German who\r\nlooked as if he were only a day from Bremen, I made signs\r\nto him that if he would help me I would give him a piece\r\nof scrip which I showed him.  The man had been long\r\nenough in the country to know that the scrip was good for\r\nlager.  He took hold manfully with me, and carried my\r\ntimbers and boards into the enclosure through a gap I\r\nmade in the fence for the purpose.  I gave him his money\r\nand he went away.  As he went to Minnesota the next day,\r\nhe never mentioned to anybody the business he had been\r\nengaged in.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, I had bought my hand-cart of the man who\r\nowned it.  I left a little pile of heavy cedar logs on\r\nthe outside, spiking them to each other indeed, that they\r\nshould not be easily moved.  And to them and to my posts\r\nI padlocked the hand-cart; nor was it ever disturbed\r\nduring my reign in those regions.  So I had easy method\r\nenough when I wanted a bundle or two of laths, or a\r\nbunch of shingles, or anything else for my castle, to\r\nbring them up in the cool of the evening, and to\r\ndischarge my load without special observation.  My pile\r\nof logs, indeed, grew eventually into a blind or screen,\r\nwhich quite protected that corner of the church alley\r\nfrom the view of any passer-by in Fernando Street.\r\n\r\nOf that whole summer, happy and bright as it all was,\r\nI look back most often on the first morning when I got\r\nfairly to work on my new home.  I told my mother that for\r\nsome weeks I should have to start early, and that she\r\nmust not think of getting up for my breakfast.  I told\r\nher that there was extra work on a job up-town, and that\r\nI had promised to be there at five every day while the\r\nsummer lasted.  She left for me a pot of coffee, which I\r\npromised her I would warm when the time for breakfast and\r\ndinner came; and for the rest, she always had my dinner\r\nready in my tin dinner-pail.  Little did she know then,\r\nsweet saint! that I was often at Fernando Street by half-\r\npast three in the first sweet gray of those summer days.\r\n\r\nOn that particular day, it was really scarcely light\r\nenough for me to find the nail I drew from the plank\r\nwhich I left for my entrance.  When I was fairly within\r\nand the plank was replaced, I felt that I was indeed\r\n\"monarch of all I surveyed.\"  What did I survey?  The\r\nchurch wall on the north; on the south, my own screen of\r\nspruce boards, now well dry; on the east and west, the\r\nten-foot fences which I had built myself; and over\r\nthat on the west, God's deep, transparent sky, in which\r\nI could still see a planet whose name I did not know.  It\r\nwas a heaven, indeed, which He had said was as much mine\r\nas his!\r\n\r\nThe first thing, of course, was to get out my frame.\r\nThis was a work of weeks.  The next thing was to raise\r\nit.  And here the first step was the only hard one, nor\r\nwas this so hard as it would seem.  The highest wall of\r\nmy house was no higher than the ten-foot fence we had\r\nalready built on the church alley.  The western wall, if,\r\nindeed, a frame house has any walls, was only eight feet\r\nhigh.  For foundations and sills, I dug deep post-holes,\r\nin which I set substantial cedar posts which I knew would\r\noutlast my day, and I framed my sills into these.  I made\r\nthe frame of the western wall lie out upon the ground in\r\none piece; and I only needed a purchase high enough, and\r\na block with repeating pulleys strong enough, to be able\r\nto haul up the  whole frame by my own strength,\r\nunassisted.  The high purchase I got readily enough by\r\nmaking what we called a \"three-leg,\" near twenty feet\r\nhigh, just where my castle was to stand.  I had no\r\ndifficulty in hauling this into its place by a solid\r\nstaple and ring, which for this purpose I drove high in\r\nthe church wall.  My multiplying pulley did the rest; and\r\nafter it was done, I took out the staple and mended the\r\nhole it had made, so the wall was as good as ever.\r\n\r\nYou see it was nobody's business what shanty or what\r\ntower old Mark Henry or the Fordyce heirs might or might\r\nnot put on the vacant corner lot.  The Fordyce heirs were\r\nall in nurseries and kindergartens in Geneva, and indeed\r\nwould have known nothing of corner lots had they been\r\nliving in their palace in Fourteenth Street.  As for Mark\r\nHenry, that one great achievement by which he rode up to\r\nFernando Street was one of the rare victories of his\r\nlife, of which ninety-nine hundredths were spent in\r\ncounting-houses.  Indeed, if he had gone there, all he\r\nwould have seen was his ten-foot fence, and he would have\r\ntaken pride to himself that he had it built so high.\r\n\r\nWhen the day of the first raising came, and the frame\r\nslipped into the mortises so nicely, as I had\r\nforeordained that it should do, I was so happy that I\r\ncould scarcely keep my secret from my mother.  Indeed,\r\nthat day I did run back to dinner.  And when she asked me\r\nwhat pleased me so, I longed to let her know; but I only\r\nsmoothed her cheeks with my hands and kissed her on both\r\nof them, and told her it was because she was so handsome\r\nthat I was so pleased.  She said she knew I had a secret\r\nfrom her, and I owned that I had, but she said she would\r\nnot try to guess, but would wait for the time for me to\r\ntell her.\r\n\r\nAnd so the summer sped by.  Of course I saw my\r\nsweetheart, as I then called my mother, less and\r\nless.  For I worked till it was pitch-dark at the castle;\r\nand after it was closed in, so I could work inside, I\r\noften worked till ten o'clock by candlelight.  I do not\r\nknow how I lived with so little sleep; I am afraid I\r\nslept pretty late on Sundays.  But the castle grew and\r\ngrew, and the common-room, which I was most eager to\r\nfinish wholly before cold weather, was in complete order\r\nthree full weeks before my mother's birthday came.\r\n\r\nThen came the joy of furnishing it.  To this I had\r\nlooked forward all the summer, and I had measured with my\r\neye many a bit of furniture, and priced, in an unaffected\r\nway, many an impossible second-hand finery, so that I\r\nknew just what I could do and what I could not do.\r\n\r\nMy mother had always wanted a Banner stove.  I knew\r\nthis, and it was a great grief to me that she had none,\r\nthough she would never say anything about it.\r\n\r\nTo my great joy, I found a second-hand Banner stove,\r\nNo. 2, at a sort of old junk-shop, which was, in fact, an\r\nold curiosity shop not three blocks away from Ninety-\r\nninth Avenue.  Some one had sold this to them while it\r\nwas really as good as new, and yet the keeper offered it\r\nto me at half-price.\r\n\r\nI hung round the place a good deal, and when the man\r\nfound I really had money and meant something, he took me\r\ninto all sorts of alleys and hiding-places, where he\r\nstored his old things away.  I made fabulous\r\nbargains there, for either the old Jew liked me\r\nparticularly, or I liked things that nobody else wanted.\r\nIn the days when his principal customers were wharf-rats,\r\nand his principal business the traffic in old cordage and\r\ncopper, he had hung out as a sign an old tavern-sign of\r\na ship that had come to him.  His place still went by the\r\nname of \"The Ship,\" though it was really, as I say, a\r\nmere wreck, a rambling, third-rate old furniture shop of\r\nthe old-curiosity kind.\r\n\r\nBut after I had safely carried the Banner to my new\r\nhouse, and was sure the funnel drew well, and that the\r\nescape of smoke and sparks was carefully guarded, many a\r\nvisit did I make to The Ship at early morning or late in\r\nthe evening, to bring away one or another treasure which\r\nI had discovered there.\r\nUnder the pretence of new-varnishing some of my\r\nmother's most precious tables and her bureau, I got them\r\naway from her also.  I knocked up, with my own hatchet\r\nand saw, a sitting-table which I meant to have permanent\r\nin the middle of the room, which was much more convenient\r\nthan anything I could buy or carry.\r\n\r\nAnd so, on the 12th of October, the eve of my\r\nmother's birthday, the common-room was all ready for her.\r\nIn her own room I had a new carpet and a new set of\r\npainted chamber furniture, which I had bought at the\r\nmaker's, and brought up piece by piece.  It cost me\r\nnineteen dollars and a half, for which I paid him in\r\ncash, which indeed he wanted sadly.\r\n\r\nSo, on the morning of the 13th of October, I kissed\r\nmy mother forty times, because that day she was forty\r\nyears old.  I told her that before midnight she should\r\nknow what the great surprise was, and I asked her if she\r\ncould hold out till then.\r\n\r\nShe let me poke as much fun at her as I chose,\r\nbecause she said she was so glad to have me at breakfast;\r\nand I stayed long after breakfast, for I had told my\r\nmother that it was her birthday, and that I should be\r\nlate.  And such a thing as my asking for an hour or two\r\nwas so rare that I took it quite of course when I did\r\nask.  I came home early at night, too.  Then I said,--\r\n\r\n\"Now, sweetheart, the surprise requires that you\r\nspend the night away from home with me.  Perhaps, if you\r\nlike the place, we will spend tomorrow there.  So I will\r\ntake Poll in her cage, and you must put up your night-\r\nthings and take them in your hand.\"\r\n\r\nShe was surprised now, for such a thing as an outing\r\nover night had never been spoken of before by either of\r\nus.\r\n\r\n\"Why, Rob,\" she said, \"you are taking too much pains\r\nfor your old sweetheart, and spending too much money for\r\nher birthday.  Now, don't you think that you should\r\nreally have as good a time, say, if we went visiting\r\ntogether, and then came back here?\"\r\n\r\nFor, you see, she never thought of herself at all; it\r\nwas only what I should like most.\r\n\r\n\"No, sweetheart dear,\" said I.  \"It is not for me,\r\nthis 13th of October, it is all for you.  And to-night's\r\nouting is not for me, it is for you; and I think you will\r\nlike it and I think Poll will like it, and I have leave\r\nfor to-morrow, and we will stay away all to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\nAs for Tom-puss, I said, we would leave some milk\r\nwhere he could find it, and I would leave a bone or two\r\nfor him.  But I whistled Rip, my dog, after me.  I took\r\nPoll's cage, my mother took her bag, and locked and left\r\nher door, unconscious that she was never to enter it\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nA Ninety-ninth Avenue car took us up to Fernando\r\nStreet.  It was just the close of twilight when we came\r\nthere.  I took my mother to Church Alley, muttered\r\nsomething about some friends, which she did not\r\nunderstand more than I did, and led her up the alley in\r\nher confused surprise.  Then I pushed aside my movable\r\nboard, and, while she was still surprised, led her in\r\nafter me and slid it back again.\r\n\r\n\"What is it, dear Rob?  Tell me--tell me!\"\r\n\r\n\"This way, sweetheart, this way!\"  This was all I\r\nwould say.\r\n\r\nI drew her after me through the long passage, led her\r\ninto the common-room, which was just lighted up by the\r\nlate evening twilight coming in between the curtains of\r\nthe great square window.  Then I fairly pushed her to the\r\ngreat, roomy easy-chair which I had brought from The\r\nShip, and placed it where she could look out on the\r\nevening glow, and I said,--\r\n\r\n\"Mother, dear, this is the surprise; this is your new\r\nhome; and, mother dear, your own boy has made it with his\r\nown hands, all for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, Rob, I do not understand--I do not understand\r\nat all.  I am so stupid.  I know I am awake.  But it is\r\nas sudden as a dream!\"\r\n\r\nSo I had to begin and to explain it all,--how here\r\nwas a vacant lot that Mark Henry had the care of, and how\r\nI had built this house for her upon it.  And long before\r\nI had explained it all, it was quite dark.  And I lighted\r\nup the pretty student's-lamp, and I made the fire in the\r\nnew Banner with my own hands.\r\n\r\nAnd that night I would not let her lift a kettle, nor\r\nso much as cut a loaf of bread.  It was my feast, I said,\r\nand I had everything ready, round to a loaf of birthday-\r\ncake, which I had ordered at Taylor's, which I had myself\r\nfrosted and dressed, and decorated with the initials of\r\nmy mother's name.\r\n\r\nAnd when the feast was over, I had the best surprise\r\nof all.  Unknown to my mother, I had begged from my Aunt\r\nBetsy my own father's portrait, and I had hung that\r\nopposite the window, and now I drew the curtain that hid\r\nit, and told my sweetheart that this and the house were\r\nher birthday presents for this year!\r\n.    .    .    .    .    .    .    .\r\n\r\nAnd this was the beginning of a happy life, which\r\nlasted nearly twelve years.  I could make a long story of\r\nit, for there was an adventure in everything,--in the way\r\nwe bought our milk, and the way we took in our coals.\r\nBut there is no room for me to tell all that, and it\r\nmight not interest other people as it does me.  I am sure\r\nmy mother was never sorry for the bold step she took when\r\nwe moved there from our tenement.  True, she saw little\r\nor no society, but she had not seen much before.  The\r\nconditions of our life were such that she did not like to\r\nbe seen coming out of Church Alley, lest people should\r\nask how she got in, and excepting in the evening, I did\r\nnot care to have her go.  In the evening I could go with\r\nher.  She did not make many calls, because she could not\r\nask people to return them.  But she would go with me to\r\nconcerts, and to the church parlor meetings, and\r\nsometimes to exhibitions; and at such places, and on\r\nSundays, she would meet, perhaps, one or another of the\r\nfew friends she had in New York.  But we cared for them\r\nless and less, I will own, and we cared more and more for\r\neach other.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the first spring came, I made an immense\r\neffort, and spaded over nearly half of the lot.  It was\r\nninety feet wide and over two hundred and sixty long--more\r\nthan half an acre.  So I knew we could have our own fresh\r\nvegetables, even if we never went to market.  My mother\r\nwas a good gardener, and she was not afraid even to\r\nhoe the corn when I was out of the way.  I dare say that\r\nthe people whom the summer left in the street above us\r\noften saw her from their back windows, but they did not\r\nknow--as how should they?--who had the charge of this\r\nlot, and there was no reason why they should be surprised\r\nto see a cornfield there.  We only raised green corn.  I\r\nam fond of Indian cake, but I did not care to grind my\r\nown corn, and I could buy sweet meal without trouble.  I\r\nsettled the milk question, after the first winter, by\r\nkeeping our own goats.  I fenced in, with a wire fence,\r\nthe northwest corner of our little empire, and put there\r\na milch goat and her two kids.  The kids were pretty\r\nlittle things, and would come and feed from my mother's\r\nhand.  We soon weaned them, so that we could milk their\r\nmother; and after that our flock grew and multiplied, and\r\nwe were never again troubled for such little milk as we\r\nused.\r\n\r\nSome old proprietor, in the old Dutch days, must have\r\nhad an orchard in these parts.  There were still left two\r\nvenerable wrecks of ancient pear-trees; and although they\r\nbore little fruit, and what they bore was good for\r\nnothing, they still gave a compact and grateful shade.\r\nI sodded the ground around them and made a seat beneath,\r\nwhere my mother would sit with her knitting all the\r\nafternoon.  Indeed, after the sods grew firm, I planted\r\nhoops there, and many a good game of croquet have she and\r\nI had together there, playing so late that we longed\r\nfor the chance they have in Sybaris, where, in the\r\nevening, they use balls of colored glass, with fireflies\r\nshut up inside.\r\n\r\nOn the 11th of February, in the year 1867, my old\r\nmaster died, to my great regret, and I truly believe to\r\nthat of his widow and her children.  His death broke up\r\nthe establishment, and I, who was always more of a\r\ncabinet-maker or joiner than carpenter or builder, opened\r\na little shop of my own, where I took orders for\r\ncupboards, drawers, stairs, and other finishing work, and\r\nwhere I employed two or three German journeymen, and was\r\nthus much more master of my own time.  In particular, I\r\nhad two faithful fellows, natives of my own father's town\r\nof Bremen.  While they were with me I could leave them a\r\nwhole afternoon at a time, while I took any little job\r\nthere might be, and worked at it at my own house at home.\r\nWhere my house was, except that it was far uptown, they\r\nnever asked, nor ever, so far as I know, cared.  This\r\ngave me the chance for many a pleasant afternoon with my\r\nmother, such as we had dreamed of in the old days when we\r\ntalked of Kansas.  I would work at the lathe or the bench\r\nand she would read to me.  Or we would put off the bench\r\ntill the evening, and we would both go out into the\r\ncornfield together.\r\n\r\nAnd so we lived year after year.  I am afraid that we\r\nworshipped each other too much.  We were in the\r\nheart of a crowded city, but there was that in our lives\r\nwhich tended a little to habits of loneliness, and I\r\nsuppose a moralist would say that our dangers lay in that\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I am almost ashamed to say that,\r\nas I sat in a seat I had made for myself in old Van der\r\nTromp's pear-tree, I would look upon my corn and peas and\r\nsquashes and tomatoes with a satisfaction which I believe\r\nmany a nobleman in England does not enjoy.\r\n\r\nTill the youngest of the Fordyce heirs was of age,\r\nand that would not be till 1880, this was all my own.  I\r\nwas, by right of possession and my own labors, lord of\r\nall this region.  How else did the writers on political\r\neconomy teach me that any property existed!\r\n\r\nI surveyed it with a secret kind of pleasure.  I had\r\nnot abundance of pears; what I had were poor and few.\r\nBut I had abundance of sweet corn, of tomatoes, of peas,\r\nand of beans.  The tomatoes were as wholesome as they\r\nwere plentiful, and as I sat I could see the long shelves\r\nof them which my mother had spread in the sun to ripen,\r\nthat we might have enough of them canned when winter\r\nshould close in upon us.  I knew I should have potatoes\r\nenough of my own raising also to begin the winter with.\r\nI should have been glad of more.  But as by any good\r\nday's work I could buy two barrels of potatoes, I did not\r\nfret myself that my stock was but small.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile my stock in bank grew fast.  Neither my\r\nmother nor I had much occasion to buy new clothes.  We\r\nwere at no charge for house-rent, insurance, or taxes.\r\nI remember that a Spanish gentleman, who was fond of me,\r\nfor whom I had made a cabinet with secret drawers, paid\r\nme in moidores and pieces-of-eight, which in those times\r\nof paper were a sight to behold.\r\n\r\nI carried home the little bag and told my mother that\r\nthis was a birthday present for her; indeed, that she was\r\nto put it all in her bed that night, that she might say\r\nshe had rolled in gold and silver.  She played with the\r\npieces, and we used them to count with as we played our\r\ngame of cribbage.\r\n\r\n\"But really, Robin, boy,\" said she, \"it is as the\r\ndirt under our feet.  I would give it all for three or\r\nfour pairs of shoes and stockings, such as we used to buy\r\nin York, but such as these Lynn-built shoes and steam-\r\nknit stockings have driven out of the market.\"\r\n\r\nIndeed, we wanted very little in our desert home.\r\n\r\nAnd so for many years we led a happy life, and we\r\nfound more in life than would have been possible had we\r\nbeen all tangled up with the cords of artificial society.\r\nI say \"we,\" for I am sure I did, and I think my dear\r\nmother did.\r\n\r\nBut it was in the seventh  year of our residence in\r\nthe hut that of a sudden I had a terrible shock or\r\nfright, and this I must now describe to you.  It\r\ncomes in about the middle of this history, and it may end\r\nthis chapter.\r\n\r\nIt was one Sunday afternoon, when I had taken the\r\nfancy, as I often did of Sundays, to inspect my empire.\r\nOf course, in a certain way, I did this every time I\r\nclimbed old Van der Tromp's pear-tree, and sat in my\r\nhawk's-nest there.  But a tour of inspection was a\r\ndifferent thing.  I walked close round the path which I\r\nhad made next the fence of the enclosure.  I went in\r\namong my goats,--even entered the goat-house and played\r\nwith my kids.  I tried the boards of the fence and the\r\ntimber-stays, to be sure they all were sound.  I had\r\npaths enough between the rows of corn and potatoes to\r\nmake a journey of three miles and half a furlong, with\r\ntwo rods more, if I went through the whole of them.  So\r\nat half-past four on this fatal afternoon I bade my\r\nmother good-by, and kissed her.  I told her I should not\r\nbe back for two hours, because I was going to inspect my\r\nempire, and I set out happily.\r\n\r\nBut in less than an hour--I can see the face of the\r\nclock now: it was twenty-two minutes after five--I flung\r\nmyself in my chair, panting for breath, and, as my mother\r\nsaid, as pale as if I had seen a ghost.  But I told her\r\nit was worse than that.\r\n\r\nI had come out from between two high rows of corn,\r\nwhich wholly covered me, upon a little patch which lay\r\nwarm to the south and west, where I had some melons\r\na-ripening, and was just lifting one of the melons, to be\r\nsure that the under surface did not rot, when close\r\nbehind it I saw the print of a man's foot, which was very\r\nplain to be seen in the soft soil.\r\n\r\nI stood like one thunderstruck, or as if I had seen\r\nan apparition.  I listened; I looked round me. I could\r\nhear nothing but the roar of the omnibuses, nor could I\r\nsee anything.  I went up and down the path, but it was\r\nall one.  I could see no other impression but that one.\r\nI went to it again, to see if there were any more, and to\r\nobserve if it might not be my fancy.  But there was no\r\nroom for that, for there was exactly the print of an\r\nEnglishman's hobnailed shoe,--the heavy heel, the prints\r\nof the heads of the nails.  There was even a piece of\r\npatch which had been put on it, though it had never been\r\nhalf-soled.\r\n\r\nHow it came there I knew not; neither could I in the\r\nleast imagine.  But, as I say, like a man perfectly\r\nconfused and out of myself, I rushed home into my hut,\r\nnot feeling the ground I went upon.  I fled into it like\r\none pursued, and, as my mother said, when I fell into my\r\nchair, panting, I looked as if I had seen a ghost.\r\n\r\nIt was worse than that, as I said to her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II\r\n\r\nI cannot well tell you how much dismay this sight of a\r\nfootprint in the ground gave me, nor how many sleepless\r\nnights it cost me.  All the time I was trying to make\r\nmy mother think that there was no ground for anxiety,\r\nand yet all the time I was showing her that I was very\r\nanxious.  The more I pretended that I was not troubled,\r\nthe more absent-minded, and so the more troubled, I\r\nappeared to her.  And yet, if I made no pretence, and\r\ntold her what I really feared, I should have driven her\r\nalmost wild by the story of my terrors.  To have our\r\npretty home broken up, perhaps to be put in the\r\nnewspapers--which was a lot that, so far, we had always\r\nescaped in our quiet and modest life--all this was more\r\nthan she or I could bear to think of.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of these cogitations, apprehensions, and\r\nreflections, it came into my thoughts one day, as I was\r\nworking at my shop down-town with my men, that all this\r\nmight be a chimera of my own, and that the foot might be\r\nthe print of my own boot as I had left it in the soil\r\nsome days before when I was looking at my melons.  This\r\ncheered me up a little, too.  I considered that I could\r\nby no means tell for certain where I had trod and where\r\nI had not, and that if at last this was the print of my\r\nown boot, I had played the part of those fools who strive\r\nto make stories of spectres, and then are themselves\r\nfrightened at them more than anybody else.\r\n\r\nSo I returned home that day in very good spirits.  I\r\ncarried to my mother a copy of Frank Leslie's Illustrated\r\nNewspaper, which had in it some pictures that I knew\r\nwould please her, and I talked with her in as light-\r\nhearted a way as I could, to try to make her think that\r\nI had forgotten my alarm.  And afterward we played two or\r\nthree games of Egyptian solitaire at the table, and I\r\nwent to bed unusually early.  But, at the first break of\r\nday, when I fancied or hoped that she was still asleep,\r\nI rose quickly, and half-dressing myself, crept out to\r\nthe melon-patch to examine again the imprint of the foot\r\nand to make sure that it was mine.\r\n\r\nAlas! it was no more mine than it was Queen\r\nVictoria's.  If it had only been cloven, I could easily\r\nhave persuaded myself whose it was, so much grief and\r\ntrouble had it cost me.  When I came to measure the mark\r\nwith my own boot, I found, just as I had seen before,\r\nthat mine was not nearly so large as this mark was.\r\nAlso, this was, as I have said, the mark of a heavy\r\nbrogan--such as I never wore--and there was the mark of\r\na strange patch near the toe, such as I had never seen,\r\nnor, indeed, have seen since, from that hour to this\r\nhour.  All these things renewed my terrors.  I went home\r\nlike a whipped dog, wholly certain now that some one had\r\nfound the secret of our home: we might be surprised in it\r\nbefore I was aware; and what course to take for my\r\nsecurity I knew not.\r\n\r\nAs we breakfasted, I opened my whole heart to my\r\nmother.  If she said so, I would carry all our little\r\nproperty, piece by piece, back to old Thunberg, the junk-\r\ndealer, and with her parrot and my umbrella we would go\r\nout to Kansas, as we used to propose.  We would give up\r\nthe game.  Or, if she thought best, we would stand on the\r\ndefensive.  I would put bottle-glass on the upper edges\r\nof the fences all the way round.\r\n\r\nThere were four or five odd revolvers at The Ship,\r\nand I would buy them all, with powder and buck-shot\r\nenough for a long siege.  I would teach her how to load,\r\nand while she loaded I would fire, till they had quite\r\nenough of attacking us in our home.  Now it has all gone\r\nby, I should be ashamed to set down in writing the\r\nfrightful contrivances I hatched for destroying these\r\n\"creatures,\" as I called them, or, at least, frightening\r\nthem, so as to prevent their coming thither any more.\r\n\r\n\"Robin, my boy,\" said my mother to me, when I gave\r\nher a chance at last, \"if they came in here to-night--\r\nwhoever `they' may be--very little is the harm that they\r\ncould do us.  But if Mr. Kennedy and twenty of his police\r\nshould come in here over the bodies of--five times five\r\nare twenty-five, twenty-five times eleven are--two\r\nhundred and seventy-five people whom you will have killed\r\nby that time, if I load as fast as thee tells me I\r\ncan, why, Robin, my boy, it will go hard for thee and me\r\nwhen the day of the assizes comes.  They will put\r\nhandcuffs on thy poor old mother and on thee, and if they\r\ndo not send thee to Jack Ketch, they will send thee to\r\nBloomingdale.\"\r\n\r\nI could not but see that there was sense in what she\r\nsaid.  Anyway, it cooled me down for the time, and I\r\nkissed her and went to my work less eager, and, indeed,\r\nless anxious, than I had been the night before.  As I\r\nwent down-town in the car, I had a chance to ask myself\r\nwhat right I had to take away the lives of these poor\r\nsavages of the neighborhood merely because they entered\r\non my possessions.  Was it their fault that they had not\r\nbeen apprenticed to carpenters?  Could they help\r\nthemselves in the arrangements which had left them\r\nsavages?  Had any one ever given them a chance to fence\r\nin an up-town lot?  Was it, in a word, I said to myself--\r\nwas it my merit or my good luck which made me as good as\r\na landed proprietor, while the Fordyce heirs had their\r\neducation?  Such thoughts, before I came to my shop, had\r\nquite tamed me down, and when I arrived there I was quite\r\noff my design, and I concluded that I had taken a wrong\r\nmeasure in my resolution to attack the savages, as I had\r\nbegun to call men who might be merely harmless loafers.\r\n\r\nIt was clearly not my business to meddle with them\r\nunless they first attacked me.  This it was my\r\nbusiness to prevent; if I were discovered and attacked,\r\nthen I knew my duty.\r\n\r\nWith these thoughts I went into my shop that day, and\r\nwith such thoughts as these, and with my mother's good\r\nsense in keeping me employed in pleasanter things than\r\nhunting for traces of savages, I got into a healthier way\r\nof thinking.\r\n\r\nThe crop of melons came in well, and many a good\r\nfeast we had from them.  Once and again I was able to\r\ncarry a nice fresh melon to an old lady my mother was\r\nfond of, who now lay sick with a tertian ague.\r\n\r\nThen we had the best sweet corn for dinner every day\r\nthat any man had in New York.  For at Delmonico's itself,\r\nthe corn the grandees had had been picked the night\r\nbefore, and had started at two o'clock in the morning on\r\nits long journey to town.  But my mother picked my corn\r\njust at the minute when she knew I was leaving my shop.\r\nShe husked it and put it in the pot, and by the time I\r\nhad come home, had slipped up the board in the fence that\r\nserved me for a door, and had washed my face and hands in\r\nmy own room, she would have dished her dinner, would have\r\nput her fresh corn upon the table, covered with a pretty\r\nnapkin; and so, as I say, I had a feast which no nabob in\r\nNew York had.  No indeed, nor any king that I know of,\r\nunless it were the King of the Sandwich Islands, and I\r\ndoubt if he were as well served as I.\r\n\r\nSo I became more calm and less careworn, though\r\nI will not say but sometimes I did look carefully to see\r\nif I could find the traces of a man's foot; but I never\r\nsaw another.\r\n\r\nUnless we went out somewhere during the evening, we\r\nwent to bed early.  We rose early as well, for I never\r\nlost the habits of my apprenticeship.  And so we were\r\nboth sound asleep in bed one night when a strange thing\r\nhappened, and a sudden fright came to us, of which I must\r\ntell quite at length, for it made, indeed, a very sudden\r\nchange in the current of our lives.\r\n\r\nI was sound asleep, as I said, and so, I found, was\r\nmy mother also.  But I must have been partly waked by\r\nsome sudden noise in the street, for I knew I was sitting\r\nup in my bed in the darkness when I heard a woman\r\nscream,--a terrible cry,--and while I was yet startled,\r\nI heard her scream again, as if she were in deadly fear.\r\nMy window was shaded by a heavy green curtain, but in an\r\ninstant I had pulled it up, and by the light of the moon\r\nI seized my trousers and put them on.\r\n\r\nI was well awake by this time, and when I flung open\r\nthe door of my house, so as to run into my garden, I\r\ncould hear many wild voices, some in English, some in\r\nGerman, some in Irish, and some with terrible cries,\r\nwhich I will not pretend I could understand.\r\n\r\nThere was no cry of a woman now, but only the howling\r\nof angry or drunken men, when they are in a rage with\r\nsome one or with each other.  What startled me was\r\nthat, whereas the woman's cry came from the street south\r\nof me, which I have called Fernando Street, the whole\r\ncrowd of men, as they howled and swore, were passing\r\nalong that street rapidly, and then stopped for an\r\ninstant, as if they were coming up what I called Church\r\nAlley.  There must have been seven or eight of them.\r\n\r\nNow, it was by Church Alley that my mother and I\r\nalways came into our house, and so into our garden.  In\r\nthe eight years, or nearly so, that I had lived there, I\r\nhad by degrees accumulated more and more rubbish near the\r\nfurthest end of the alley as a screen, so to speak, that\r\nwhen my mother or I came in or out, no one in the street\r\nmight notice us.  I had even made a little wing-fence out\r\nfrom my own, to which my hand-cart was chained.  Next\r\nthis I had piled broken brickbats and paving-stones, and\r\nother heavy things, that would not be stolen.  There was\r\nthe stump and the root of an old pear-tree there, too\r\nheavy to steal, and too crooked and hard to clean or saw.\r\nThere was a bit of curbstone from the street, and other\r\nsuch trash, which quite masked the fence and the hand-\r\ncart.\r\n\r\nOn the other side--that is, the church side, or the\r\nside furthest from the street--was the sliding-board in\r\nthe fence, where my mother and I came in.  So soon as it\r\nwas slid back, no man could see that the fence was not\r\nsolid.\r\n\r\nAt this moment in the night, however, when I\r\nfound that this riotous, drunken crew were pausing\r\nat the entrance of Church Alley, as doubting if they\r\nwould not come down, I ran back through the passage,\r\nknocking loudly for my mother as I passed, and coming to\r\nmy coal-bin, put my eye at the little hole through which\r\nI always reconnoitred before I slid the door.  I could\r\nsee nothing, nor at night ought I to have expected to do\r\nso.\r\n\r\nBut I could hear, and I heard what I did not expect.\r\nI could hear the heavy panting of one who had been\r\nrunning, and as I listened I heard a gentle, low voice\r\nsob out, \"Ach, ach, mein Gott!  Ach, mein Gott!\" or words\r\nthat I thought were these, and I was conscious, when I\r\ntried to move the door, that some one was resting close\r\nupon it.\r\n\r\nAll the same, I put my shoulder stoutly to the cross-\r\nbar, to which the boards of the door were nailed; I slid\r\nit quickly in its grooves, and as it slid, a woman fell\r\ninto the passage.\r\n\r\nShe was wholly surprised by the motion, so that she\r\ncould not but fall.  I seized her and dragged her in,\r\nsaying, \"Hush, hush, hush!\" as I did so.  But not so\r\nquick was I but that she screamed once more as I drew to\r\nthe sliding-door and thrust in the heavy bolt which held\r\nit.\r\n\r\nIn an instant my mother was in the passage with a\r\nlight in her hand.  In another instant I had seized the\r\nlight and put it out.  But that instant was enough for\r\nher and me to see that here was a lovely girl, with\r\nno hat or bonnet on, with her hair floating wildly, both\r\nher arms bleeding, and her clothes all stained with\r\nblood.  She could see my mother's face of amazement, and\r\nshe could see my finger on my mouth, as with the other I\r\ndashed out the candle.  We all thought quickly, and we\r\nall knew that we must keep still.\r\n\r\nBut that unfortunate scream of hers was enough.\r\nThough no one of us all uttered another sound, this was\r\nlike a \"view-halloo,\" to bring all those dogs down upon\r\nus.  The passage was dark, and, to my delight, I heard\r\nsome of them breaking their shins over the curbstone and\r\nold pear-tree of my defences.  But they were not such\r\nhounds as were easily thrown off the scent, and there\r\nwere enough to persevere while the leaders picked\r\nthemselves up again.\r\n\r\nThen how they swore and cursed and asked questions!\r\nAnd we three stood as still as so many frightened\r\nrabbits.  In an instant more one of them, who spoke in\r\nEnglish, said he would be hanged if he thought she had\r\ngone into the church, that he believed she had got\r\nthrough the fence; and then, with his fist, or something\r\nharder, he began trying the boards on our side, and\r\nothers of them we could hear striking those on the other\r\nside of the alley-way.\r\n\r\nWhen it came to this, I whispered to my mother that\r\nshe must never fear, only keep perfectly still.  She\r\ndragged the frightened girl into our kitchen, which\r\nwas our sitting-room, and they both fell, I know not how,\r\ninto the great easy-chair.\r\n\r\nFor my part, I seized the light ladder, which always\r\nhung ready at the door, and ran with it at my full speed\r\nto the corner of Fernando Street and the alley.  I\r\nplanted the ladder, and was on the top of the fence in an\r\ninstant\r\n\r\nThen I sprang my watchman's rattle, which had hung by\r\nthe ladder, and I whirled it round well.  It wholly\r\nsilenced the sound of the swearing fellows up the\r\npassage, and their pounding.  When I found they were\r\nstill, I cried out:--\r\n\r\n\"This way, 24! this way, 47!  I have them all penned\r\nup here!  Signal the office, 42, and bid them send us a\r\nsergeant.  This way, fellows--up Church Alley!\"\r\n\r\nWith this I was down my ladder again.  But my gang of\r\nsavages needed no more.  I could hear them rushing out of\r\nthe alley as fast as they might, not one of them waiting\r\nfor 24 or 47.  This was lucky for me, for as it happened\r\nI was ten minutes older before I heard two patrolmen on\r\nthe outside, wondering what frightened old cove had been\r\nat the pains to spring a rattle.\r\n\r\nThe moonlight shone in at the western window of the\r\nkitchen, so that as I came in I could just make out the\r\nfigure of my mother and of the girl, lying, rather than\r\nsitting, in her lap and her arms.  I was not afraid to\r\nspeak now, and I told my mother we were quite safe again,\r\nand she told the poor girl so.  I struck a match and\r\nlighted the lamp as soon as I could.  The poor,\r\nfrightened creature started as I did so, and then fell on\r\nher knees at my mother's feet, took both her hands in her\r\nown, and seemed like one who begs for mercy, or, indeed,\r\nfor life.\r\n\r\nMy poor, dear mother was all amazed, and her eyes\r\nwere running with tears at the sight of the poor thing's\r\nterror.  She kissed her again and again; she stroked her\r\nbeautiful golden hair with her soft hands; she said in\r\nevery word that she could think of that she was quite\r\nsafe now, and must not think of being frightened any\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nBut it was clear in a moment that the girl could not\r\nunderstand any language that we could speak.  My mother\r\ntried her with a few words of German, and she smiled\r\nthen; but she shook her head prettily, as if to say that\r\nshe thanked her, but could not speak to her in that way\r\neither.  Then she spoke eagerly in some language that we\r\ncould not understand.  But had it been the language of\r\nHottentots, we should have known that she was begging my\r\nmother not to forsake her, so full of entreaty was every\r\nword and every gesture.\r\n\r\nMy dear, sweet mother lifted her at last into the\r\neasy-chair and made her lie there while she dipped some\r\nhot water from her boiler and filled a large basin in her\r\nsink.  Then she led the pretty creature to it, and washed\r\nfrom her arms, hands, and face the blood that had\r\nhardened upon them, and looked carefully to find what her\r\nwounds were.  None of them were deep, though there\r\nwere ugly scratches on her beautiful arms; they were cut\r\nby glass, as I guessed then, and as we learned from her\r\nafterward.  My mother was wholly prepared for all such\r\nsurgery as was needed here; she put on two bandages where\r\nshe thought they were needed, she plastered up the other\r\nscratches with court-plaster, and then, as if the girl\r\nunderstood her, she said to her, \"And now, my dear child,\r\nyou must come to bed; there is no danger for you more.\"\r\n\r\nThe poor girl had grown somewhat reassured in the\r\ncomfortable little kitchen, but her terror seemed to come\r\nback at any sign of removal; she started to her feet,\r\nalmost as if she were a wild creature.  But I would defy\r\nany one to be afraid of my dear mother, or indeed to\r\nrefuse to do what she bade, when she smiled so in her\r\ninviting way and put out her hand; and so the girl went\r\nwith her, bowing to me, or dropping a sort of courtesy in\r\nher foreign fashion, as she went out of the door, and I\r\nwas left to see what damage had been done to my castle by\r\nthe savages, as I called them.\r\n\r\nI had sprung the rattle none too soon; for one of\r\nthese rascals, as it proved--I suppose it was the same\r\nwho swore that she had not gone into the church--with\r\nsome tool or other he had in his hand, had split out a\r\nbit of the fence and had pried out a part of a plank.  I\r\nhad done my work too well for any large piece to give\r\nway.  But the moment I looked into my coal-bin I saw that\r\nsomething was amiss.  I did not like very well to go\r\nto the outside, but I must risk something; so I took out\r\na dark lantern which I always kept ready.  Sure enough,\r\nas I say, the fellow had struck so hard and so well that\r\nhe had split out a piece of board, and a little coal even\r\nhad fallen upon the passage-way.  I was not much\r\ndispleased at this, for if he thought no nearer the truth\r\nthan that he had broken into a coal-bin of the church,\r\nwhy, he was far enough from his mark for me.  After\r\nfinding this, however, I was anxious enough, lest any of\r\nthem should return, not to go to bed again that night;\r\nbut all was still as death, and, to tell the truth, I\r\nfell asleep in my chair.  I doubt whether my mother\r\nslept, or her frightened charge.\r\n\r\nI was at work in the passage early the next morning\r\nwith some weather-stained boards I had, and before nine\r\no'clock I had doubled all that piece of fence, from my\r\nwing where my hand-cart was to the church, and I had\r\nspiked the new boards on, which looked like old boards,\r\nas I said, with tenpenny nails; so that he would be a\r\nstout burglar who would cut through them unless he had\r\ntools for his purpose and daylight to work by.  As I was\r\ngathering up my tools to go in, a coarse, brutal-looking\r\nIrishman came walking up the alley and looked round.  My\r\nwork was so well done, and I had been so careful to leave\r\nno chips, that even then he could not have guessed that\r\nI had been building the fence anew, though I fancied\r\nhe looked at it.  He seemed to want to excuse himself for\r\nbeing there at all, and asked me, with an oath and in a\r\nbroad Irish brogue, if there were no other passage\r\nthrough.  I had the presence of mind to say in German,\r\n\"Wollen sie sprechen Deutsch?\" and so made as if I\r\ncould not understand him; and then, kneeling on the\r\ncellar-door of the church, pretended to put a key into\r\nthe lock, as if I were making sure that I had made it\r\nfirm.\r\n\r\nAnd with that, he turned round with another oath, as\r\nif he had come out of his way, and went out of the alley,\r\nclosely followed by me.  I watched him as long as I\r\ndared, but as he showed no sign of going back to the\r\nalley, I at last walked round a square with my tools, and\r\nso came back to my mother and the pretty stranger.\r\n\r\nMy mother had been trying to get at her story.  She\r\nmade her understand a few words of German, but they\r\ntalked by signs and smiles and tears and kisses much more\r\nthan by words; and by this time they understood each\r\nother so well that my mother had persuaded her not to go\r\naway that day.\r\n\r\nNor did she go out for many days after; I will go\r\nbefore my story far enough to say that.  She had, indeed,\r\nbeen horribly frightened that night, and she was as loath\r\nto go out again into the streets of New York as I should\r\nbe to plunge from a safe shore into some terrible,\r\nhowling ocean; or, indeed, as one who found himself safe\r\nat home would be to trust himself to the tender\r\nmercies of a tribe of cannibals.\r\n\r\nTwo such loving women as they were were not long in\r\nbuilding up a language, especially as my mother had\r\nlearned from my father and his friends, in her early\r\nlife, some of the common words of German--what she called\r\na bread-and-butter German.  For our new inmate was a\r\nSwedish girl.  Her story, in short, was this:--\r\n\r\nShe had been in New York but two days.  On the voyage\r\nover, they had had some terrible sickness on the vessel,\r\nand the poor child's mother had died very suddenly and\r\nhad been buried in the sea.  Her father had died long\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nThis was, as you may think, a terrible shock to her.\r\nBut she had hoped and hoped for the voyage to come to an\r\nend, because there was a certain brother of hers in\r\nAmerica whom they were to meet at their landing, and\r\nthough she was very lonely on the packet-ship, in which\r\nshe and her mother and a certain family of the name of\r\nHantsen--of whom she had much to say--were the only\r\nSwedes, still she expected to find the brother almost as\r\nsoon, as I may say, as they saw the land.\r\n\r\nShe felt badly enough that he did not come on board\r\nwith the quarantine officer.  When the passengers were\r\nbrought to Castle Garden, and no brother came, she felt\r\nworse.  However, with the help of the clerks there, she\r\ngot off a letter to him, somewhere in Jersey, and\r\nproposed to wait as long as they would let her, till he\r\nshould come.\r\n\r\nThe second day there came a man to the Garden, who\r\nsaid he was a Dane, but he spoke Swedish well enough.  He\r\nsaid her brother was sick, and had sent him to find her.\r\nShe was to come with her trunks, and her mother's, and\r\nall their affairs, to his house, and the same afternoon\r\nthey should go to where the brother was.\r\n\r\nWithout doubt or fear she went with this man, and\r\nspent the day at a forlorn sort of hotel which she\r\ndescribed, but which I never could find again.  Toward\r\nnight the man came again and bade her take a bag, with\r\nher one change of dress, and come with him to her\r\nbrother.\r\n\r\nAfter a long ride through the city, they got out at\r\na house which, thank God! was only one block from\r\nFernando Street.  And there this simple, innocent\r\ncreature, as she went in, asked where her brother was, to\r\nmeet only a burst of laughter from one or two coarse-\r\nlooking men, and from half-a-dozen brazen-faced girls\r\nwhom she hated, she said, the minute she saw them.\r\n\r\nExcept that an old woman took off her shawl and cloak\r\nand bonnet, and took away from her the travelling things\r\nshe had in her hand, nobody took any care of her but to\r\nlaugh at her, and mock her if she dared say anything.\r\n\r\nShe tried to go out to the door to find even the\r\nDane who had brought her there, but she was given to\r\nunderstand that he was coming again for her, and that she\r\nmust wait till he came.  As for her brother, there was no\r\nbrother there, nor had been any.  The poor girl had been\r\ntrapped, and saw that she had been trapped; she had been\r\nspirited away from everybody who ever heard of her\r\nmother, and was in the clutches, as she said to my mother\r\nafterward, of a crew of devils who knew nothing of love\r\nor of mercy.\r\n\r\nThey did try to make her eat and drink,--tried to\r\nmake her drink champagne, or any other wine; but they had\r\nno fool to deal with.  The girl did not, I think, let her\r\ncaptors know how desperate were her resolutions.  But her\r\neyes were wide open, and she was not going to lose any\r\nchance.  She was all on the alert for her escape when, at\r\neleven o'clock, the Dane came at last whom she had been\r\nexpecting so anxiously.\r\n\r\nThe girl asked him for her brother, only to be put\r\noff by one excuse or another, and then to hear from him\r\nthe most loathsome talk of his admiration, not to say his\r\npassion, for her.\r\n\r\nThey were nearly alone by this time, and he led her\r\nunresisting, as he thought, into another smaller room,\r\nbrilliantly lighted, and, as she saw in a glance, gaudily\r\nfurnished, with wine and fruit and cake on a side-\r\ntable,--a room where they would be quite alone.\r\n\r\nShe walked simply across and looked at herself in the\r\ngreat mirror.  Then she made some foolish little\r\nspeech about her hair, and how pale she looked.  Then she\r\ncrossed to the sofa, and sat upon it with as tired an air\r\nas he might have expected of one who had lived through\r\nsuch a day.  Then she looked up at him and even smiled\r\nupon him, she said, and asked him if he would not ask\r\nthem for some cold water.\r\n\r\nThe fellow turned into the passage-way, well pleased\r\nwith her submission, and in the same instant the girl was\r\nat the window as if she had flown across the room.\r\n\r\nFool!  The window was made fast, not by any moving\r\nbolt, either.  It was nailed down, and it did not give a\r\nhairs-breadth to her hand.\r\n\r\nLittle cared she for that.  She sat on the window-\r\nseat, which was broad enough to hold her; she braced her\r\nfeet against the foot of the bedstead, which stood just\r\nnear enough to her; she turned enough to bring her\r\nshoulder against the window-sash, and then with her whole\r\nforce she heaved herself against the sash, and the entire\r\nwindow, of course, gave way.\r\n\r\nThe girl caught herself upon the blind, which swung\r\nopen before her.  She pulled herself free from the sill\r\nand window-seat, and dropped fearless into the street.\r\n\r\nThe fall was not long.  She lighted on her feet and\r\nran as only fear could teach her to run.  Where to, she\r\nknew not; but she thought she turned a corner before she\r\nheard any voices from behind.\r\n\r\nStill she ran.  And it was when she came to the\r\ncorner of the next street that she heard for the first\r\ntime the screams of pursuers.\r\n\r\nShe turned again, like a poor hunted hare as she was.\r\nBut what was her running to theirs?  She was passing our\r\nlong fence in Fernando Street, and then for the first\r\ntime she screamed for help.\r\n\r\nIt was that scream which waked me.\r\n\r\nShe saw the steeple of the church.  She had a dim\r\nfeeling that a church would be an asylum.  So was it that\r\nshe ran up our alley, to find that she was in a trap\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nAnd then it was that she fell against my door, that\r\nshe cried twice, \"Oh, my God!  Oh, my God!\" and that the\r\ngood God, who had heard her, sent me to draw her in.\r\n\r\nWe had to learn her language, in a fashion, and she\r\nto learn ours, before we understood her story in this\r\nway.  But at the very first my mother made out that the\r\ngirl had fled from savages who meant worse than death for\r\nher.  So she understood why she was so frightened at\r\nevery sound, and why at first she was afraid to stay with\r\nus, yet more afraid to go.\r\n\r\nBut this passed off in a day or two.  She took to my\r\nmother with a sort of eager way which showed how she must\r\nhave loved her own mother, and how much she lost when she\r\nlost her.  And that was one of the parts of her sad story\r\nthat we understood.\r\n\r\nNo one, I think, could help loving my mother; but\r\nhere was a poor, storm-tossed creature who, I might say,\r\nhad nothing else to love, seeing she had lost all trace\r\nof this brother, and here was my mother, soothing her,\r\ncomforting her, dressing her wounds for her, trying to\r\nmake her feel that God's world was not all wickedness;\r\nand the girl in return poured out her whole heart.\r\n\r\nWhen my mother explained to her that she should not\r\nlet her go away till her brother was found, then for the\r\nfirst time she seemed perfectly happy.  She was indeed\r\nthe loveliest creature I ever put my eyes on.\r\n\r\nShe was then about nineteen years old, of a delicate\r\ncomplexion naturally, which was now a little browned by\r\nthe sea-air.  She was rather tall than otherwise, but her\r\nfigure was so graceful that I think you never thought her\r\ntall.  Her eyes were perhaps deep-set, and of that\r\nstrange gray which I have heard it said the goddesses in\r\nthe Greek poetry had.  Still, when she was sad, one saw\r\nthe less of all this.  It was not till she forgot her\r\ngrief for the instant in the certainty that she might\r\nrest with my mother, so that her whole face blazed with\r\njoy, that I first knew what the perfect beauty of a\r\nperfect woman was.\r\n\r\nHer name, it seemed, was Frida,--a name made from the\r\nname of one of the old goddesses among the Northmen, the\r\nsame from whom our day Friday is named.  She is the half-\r\nsister of Thor, from whom Thursday is named, and the\r\ndaughter of Wodin, from whom Wednesday is named.\r\n\r\nI knew little of all this then, but I did not wonder\r\nwhen I read afterward that this northern goddess was the\r\nGoddess of Love, the friend of song, the most beautiful\r\nof all their divinities,--queen of spring and light and\r\neverything lovely.\r\n\r\nBut surely never any one took fewer of the airs of a\r\ngoddess than our Frida did while she was with us.  She\r\nwould watch my mother, as if afraid that she should put\r\nher hand to a gridiron or a tin dipper.  She gave her to\r\nunderstand, in a thousand pretty ways, that she should be\r\nher faithful, loving, and sincere. servant.  If she would\r\nonly show her what to do, she would work for her as a\r\nchild that loved her.  And so indeed she did.  My dear\r\nmother would laugh and say she was quite a fine lady now,\r\nfor Frida would not let her touch broom nor mop, skimmer\r\nnor dusting-cloth.\r\n\r\nThe girl would do anything but go out upon an errand.\r\nShe could not bear to see the other side of the fence.\r\nWhat she thought of it all I do not know.  Whether she\r\nthought it was the custom in America for young men to\r\nlive shut up with their mothers in enclosures of half an\r\nacre square, or whether she thought we two made some\r\npeculiar religious order, whose rules provided that one\r\nwoman and one man should live together in a convent or\r\nmonastery of their own, or whether she supposed half New\r\nYork was made up, as Marco Polo found Pekin, of\r\ncottages or of gardens, I did not know, nor did I much\r\ncare.  I could see that here was provided a companion for\r\nmy mother, who was else so lonely, and I very soon found\r\nthat she was as much a companion for me.\r\n\r\nSo soon as we could understand her at all, I took the\r\nname of her brother and his address.  When he wrote last\r\nhe was tending a saw-mill at a place about seven miles\r\naway from Tuckahoe, in Jersey.  But he said he was going\r\nto leave there at once, so that they need not write\r\nthere.  He sent the money for their passage, and\r\npromised, as I said, to meet them at New York.\r\n\r\nThis was a poor clew at the best.  But I put a good\r\nface on it, and promised her I would find him if he could\r\nbe found.  And I spared no pains.  I wrote to the\r\npostmaster at Tuckahoe, and to a minister I heard of\r\nthere.  I inquired of the Swedish consuls in New York and\r\nPhiladelphia.  Indeed, in the end, I went to Tuckahoe\r\nmyself, with her, to inquire.  But this was long after.\r\nHowever, I may say here, once for all, to use an old\r\nphrase of my mother's, we never found \"hide nor hair\" of\r\nhim.  And although this grieved Frida, of course, yet it\r\ncame on her gradually, and as she had never seen him to\r\nremember him, it was not the same loss as if they had\r\ngrown up together.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile that first winter was, I thought, the\r\npleasantest I had ever known in my life.  I did not have\r\nto work very hard now, for my business was rather\r\nthe laying out work for my men, and sometimes a nice job\r\nwhich needed my hand on my lathe at home, or in some\r\nother delicate affair that I could bring home with me.\r\n\r\nWe were teaching Frida English, my mother and I, and\r\nshe and I made a great frolic of her teaching me Swedish.\r\nI would bring home Swedish newspapers and stories for\r\nher, and we would puzzle them out together,--she as much\r\ntroubled to find the English word as I to find out the\r\nSwedish.  Then she sang like a bird when she was about\r\nher household work, or when she sat sewing for my mother,\r\nand she had not lived with us a fortnight before she\r\nbegan to join us on Sunday evenings in the choruses of\r\nthe Methodist hymns which my mother and I sang together.\r\nSo then we made her sing Swedish hymns to us.  And before\r\nshe knew it, the great tears would brim over her deep\r\neyes and would run down in pearls upon her cheek.\r\nNothing set her to thinking of her old home as those\r\nSunday evenings did.  Of a Sunday evening we could make\r\nher go out with us to church sometimes.  Not but then she\r\nwould half cover her face with a veil, so afraid was she\r\nthat we might meet the Dane.  But I told her that the\r\nlast place we should find him at would be at church on\r\nSunday evening.\r\n\r\nI have come far in advance of my story, that I might\r\nmake any one who reads this life of mine to understand\r\nhow naturally and simply this poor lost bird nestled down\r\ninto our quiet life, and how the house that was\r\nbuilt for two proved big enough for three.  For I made\r\nsome new purchases now, and fitted up the little middle\r\nchamber for Frida's own use.  We had called it the \"spare\r\nchamber\" before, in joke.  But now my mother fitted\r\npretty curtains to it, and other hangings, without\r\nFrida's knowledge.  I had a square of carpet made up at\r\nthe warehouse for the middle of the floor, and by making\r\nher do one errand and another in the corner of the garden\r\none pleasant afternoon in November, we had it all\r\nprettily fitted up for her room before she knew it.  And\r\na great gala we made of it when she came in from\r\ngathering the seeds of the calystegia, which she had been\r\nsent for.\r\n\r\nShe looked like a northern Flora as she came in, with\r\nher arms all festooned by the vines she had been pulling\r\ndown.  And when my mother made her come out to the door\r\nshe had never seen opened before, and led her in, and\r\ntold her that this pretty chamber was all her own, the\r\npretty creature flushed crimson red at first, and then\r\nher quick tears ran over, and she fell on my mother's\r\nneck and kissed her as if she would never be done.  And\r\nthen she timidly held her hand out to me, too, as I stood\r\nin the doorway, and said, in her slow, careful English,--\r\n\r\n\"And you, too--and you, too.  I must tank you both,\r\nalso, especially.  You are so good--so good to de poor\r\nlost girl!\" That was a very happy evening.\r\n\r\nBut, as I say, I have gone ahead of my story.  For\r\nbefore we had these quiet evenings we were fated to have\r\nmany anxious ones and one stormy one.\r\n\r\nThe very first day that Frida was with us, I felt\r\nsure that the savages would make another descent upon us.\r\nThey had heard her scream, that was certain.  They knew\r\nshe had not passed them, that was certain.  They knew\r\nthere was a coal-bin on the other side of our fence, that\r\nwas certain.  They would have reason enough for being\r\nafraid to have her at large, if, indeed, there were no\r\nworse passion than fear driving some of them in pursuit\r\nof her.  I could not keep out of my mind the beastly look\r\nof the Irishman who asked me, with such an ugly leer on\r\nhis face, if there were no passage through.  Not that I\r\ntold either of the two women of my fears.  But, all the\r\nsame, I did not undress myself for a week, and sat in the\r\ngreat easy-chair in our kitchen through the whole of\r\nevery night, waiting for the least sound of alarm.\r\n\r\nNext to the savages, I had always lived in fear of\r\nbeing discovered in my retreat by the police, who would\r\ncertainly think it strange to find a man and his mother\r\nliving in a shed, without any practicable outside door,\r\nin what they called a vacant lot.\r\n\r\nBut I have read of weak nations in history which were\r\nfain to call upon one neighbor whom they did not like to\r\nprotect them against another whom they liked less.\r\nI made up my mind, in like wise, to go round to the\r\npolice-station nearest me.\r\n\r\nAnd so, having dressed myself in my black coat, and\r\nput on a round hat and gloves, I bought me a Malacca\r\nwalking-stick, such as was then in fashion, and called\r\nupon the captain in style.  I told him I lived next the\r\nchurch, and that on such and such a night there was a\r\nregular row among roughs, and that several of them went\r\nstorming up the alley in a crowd.  I said, \"Although your\r\nmen were there as quick as they could come, these fellows\r\nhad all gone before they came.\"  But then I explained\r\nthat I had seen a fellow hanging about the alley in the\r\ndaytime, who seemed to be there for no good; that there\r\nwas a hand-cart kept there by a workman, who seemed to be\r\nan honest fellow, and, perhaps, all they wanted was to\r\nsteal that; that, if I could, I would warn him.  But\r\nmeanwhile, I said, I had come round to the station to\r\ngive the warning of my suspicions, that if my rattle was\r\nheard again, the patrolmen might know what was in the\r\nwind.\r\n\r\nThe captain was a good deal impressed by my make-up\r\nand by the ease of my manner.  He affected to be\r\nperfectly well acquainted with me, although we had never\r\nhappened to meet at the Century Club or at the Union\r\nLeague.  I confirmed the favorable impression I had made\r\nby leaving my card, which I had had handsomely engraved:\r\n\"MR. ROBINSON CRUSOE.\"  With my pencil I added my\r\ndown-town address, where, I said, a note or telegram\r\nwould find me.\r\n\r\nI was not a day too soon with my visit to this\r\ngentleman.  That very night, after my mother and Frida\r\nhad gone to bed, as I sat in my easychair, there came\r\nover me one of those strange intimations which I have\r\nnever found it safe to disregard.  Sometimes it is of\r\ngood, and sometimes of bad.  This time it made me certain\r\nthat all was not well.  To relieve my fears I lifted my\r\nladder over the wall and dropped it in the alley.  I\r\nswung myself down and carried it to the very end of the\r\nalley, to the place where I had dragged poor Frida in.\r\nThe moon fell on the fence opposite ours.  My wing-fence\r\nand hand-cart were all in shade.  But everything was safe\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nAgain I chided myself for my fears, when, as I looked\r\nup the alley to the street, I saw a group of four men\r\ncome in stealthily.  They said not a word, but I could\r\nmake out their forms distinctly against the houses\r\nopposite.\r\n\r\nI was caught in my own trap!\r\n\r\nNot quite!  They had not seen me, for I was wholly in\r\nshadow.  I stepped quickly in at my own slide.  I pushed\r\nit back and bolted it securely, and with my heart in my\r\nmouth, I waited at my hole of observation.  In a minute\r\nmore they were close around me, though they did not\r\nsuspect I was so near.\r\n\r\nThey also had a dark-lantern, and, I thought,\r\nmore than one.  They spoke in low tones; but as they\r\nhad no thought they had a hearer quite so near, I could\r\nhear all they said.\r\n\r\n\"I tell you it was this side, and this is the side I\r\nheard their deuced psalm-singing day before yesterday.\"\r\n\r\n\"What if he did hear psalm-singing?  Are you going to\r\nbreak into a man's garden because he sings psalms?  I\r\ncame here to find out where the girl went to; and now you\r\ntalk of psalm-singing and coal-bins.\"  This from another,\r\nwhose English was poor, and in whom I fancied I heard the\r\nDane.  It was clear enough that be spoke sense, and a\r\nsort of doubt fell on the whole crew; but speaker No. 1,\r\nwith a heavy crowbar he had, smashed into my pine wall,\r\nas I have a right to call it now, with a force which made\r\nthe splinters fly.\r\n\r\n\"I should think we were all at Niblo's,\" said a man\r\nof slighter build, \"and that we were playing Humpty\r\nDumpty.  Because a girl flew out of a window, you think\r\na fence opened to take her in. Why should she not go\r\nthrough a door? and he kicked with his foot upon the\r\nheavy sloping cellar-door of the church, which just rose\r\na little from the pavement.  It was the doorway which\r\nthey used there when they took in their supply of coal.\r\nThe moon fell full on one side of it.  To my surprise it\r\nwas loose and gave way.\r\n\r\n\"Here is where the girl flew to, and here is\r\nwhere Bully Bigg, the donkey, let her slip out of\r\nhis fingers.  I knew he was a fool, but I did not know he\r\nwas such a fool,\" said the Dane (if he were the Dane).\r\n\r\nI will not pretend to write down the oaths and foul\r\nwords which came in between every two of the words I have\r\nrepeated.\r\n\r\n\"Fool yourself!\" replied the Bully; \"and what sort of\r\na fool is the man who comes up a blind alley looking\r\nafter a girl that will not kiss him when he bids her?\"\r\n\r\n\"Anyway,\" put in another of the crew, who had just\r\nnow lifted the heavy cellar-door, \"other people may find\r\nit handy to hop down here when the `beaks' are too near\r\nthem.  It's a handy place to know of in a dark night, if\r\nthe dear deacons do choose to keep it open for a poor\r\npsalm-singing tramp, who has no chance at the station-\r\nhouse.  Here, Lopp, you are the tallest,--jump in and\r\ntell us what is there;\" and at this moment the Dane\r\ncaught sight of my unfortunate ladder, lying full in the\r\nmoonlight.  I could see him seize it and run to the\r\ndoorway with it with a deep laugh and some phrase of his\r\nown country talk, which I did not understand.\r\n\r\n\"The deacons are very good,\" said the savage who had\r\nlifted the cellar-door.  \"They make everything handy for\r\nus poor fellows.\"\r\n\r\nAnd though he had not planted the ladder, he was the\r\nfirst to run down, and called for the rest to follow.\r\nThe Dane was second, Lopp was third, and \"The\r\nBully,\" as the big rascal seemed to be called by\r\ndistinction, was the fourth.\r\n\r\nI saw him disappear from my view with a mixture of\r\nwonder and terror which I will not describe.  I seized my\r\nlight overcoat, which always hung in the passage.  I\r\nflung open my sliding-door and shut it again behind me.\r\nI looked into the black of the cellar to see the\r\nreflections from their distant lanterns, and without a\r\nsound I drew up my ladder.  Then I ran to the head of the\r\nalley and sounded my rattle as I would have sounded the\r\ntrumpet for a charge in battle.  The officers joined me\r\nin one moment.\r\n\r\n\"I am the man who spoke to the captain about these\r\nrowdies.  Four of them are in the cellar of the church\r\nyonder now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you know who?\"\r\n\r\n\"One they called Lopp, and one they called Bully\r\nBigg,\" said I. \"I do not know the others' names.\"\r\n\r\nThe officers were enraptured.\r\n\r\nI led them, and two other patrolmen who joined us, to\r\nthe shelter of my wing-wall.  In a few minutes the head\r\nof the Dane appeared, as he was lifted from below.  With\r\nan effort and three or four oaths, he struggled out upon\r\nthe ground, to be seized and gagged the moment he stepped\r\nback.  With varying fortunes, Bigg and Lopp emerged, and\r\nwere seized and handcuffed in turn.  The fourth\r\nsurrendered on being summoned.\r\n\r\nWhat followed comes into the line of daily life and\r\nthe morning newspaper so regularly that I need not\r\ndescribe it.  Against the Dane it proved that endless\r\nwarrants could be brought immediately.  His lair of\r\nstolen baggage and other property was unearthed, and\r\ncountless sufferers claimed their own.  I was able to\r\nrecover Frida's and her mother's possessions--the locks\r\non the trunks still unbroken.  The Dane himself would\r\nhave been sent to the Island on I know not how many\r\ncharges, but that the Danish minister asked for him that\r\nhe might be hanged in Denmark, and he was sent and hanged\r\naccordingly.\r\n\r\nLopp was sent to Sing-Sing for ten years, and has not\r\nyet been pardoned.\r\n\r\nBigg and Cordon were sent to Blackwell's Island for\r\nthree years each.  And so the land had peace for that\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThat winter, as there came on one and another idle\r\nalarm that Frida's brother might be heard from, my heart\r\nsank with the lowest terror lest she should go away.  And\r\nin the spring I told her that if she went away I was sure\r\nI should die.  And the dear girl looked down, and looked\r\nup, and said she thought--she thought she should, too.\r\nAnd we told my mother that we had determined that Frida\r\nshould never go away while we stayed there.  And she\r\napproved.\r\n\r\nSo I wrote a note to the minister of the church which\r\nhad protected us so long, and one night we slid the\r\nboard carefully, and all three walked round, fearless of\r\nthe Dane, and Frida and I were married.\r\n\r\nIt was more than three years after, when I received\r\nby one post three letters, which gave us great ground for\r\nconsultation.  The first was from my old friend and\r\npatron, the Spaniard.  He wrote to me from Chicago, where\r\nhe, in his turn, had fallen in with a crew of savages,\r\nwho had stripped him of all he had, under the pretext of\r\na land-enterprise they engaged him in, and had left him\r\nwithout a real, as he said.  He wanted to know if I could\r\nnot find him some clerkship, or even some place as\r\njanitor, in New York.\r\n\r\nThe second letter was from old Mr. Henry in\r\nPhiladelphia, who had always employed me after my old\r\nmaster's death.  He said that the fence around the lot in\r\nNinety-ninth Avenue might need some repairs, and he\r\nwished I would look at it.  He was growing old, he said,\r\nand he did not care to come to New York.  But the Fordyce\r\nheirs would spend ten years in Europe.\r\n\r\nThe third letter was from Tom Grinnell.\r\n\r\nI wrote to Mr. Henry that I thought he had better let\r\nme knock up a little office, where a keeper might sleep,\r\nif necessary; that there was some stuff with which I\r\ncould put up such an office, and that I had an old\r\nfriend, a Spaniard, who was an honest fellow, and if he\r\nmight have his bed in the office, would take\r\ngratefully whatever his services to the estate proved\r\nworth.  He wrote me by the next day's mail that I might\r\nengage the Spaniard and finish the office.  So I wrote to\r\nthe Spaniard and got a letter from him, accepting the\r\npost provided for him.  Then I wrote to Tom Grinnell.\r\n\r\nThe last day we spent at our dear old home, I\r\noccupied myself in finishing the office as Friend Henry\r\nbade me.  I made a \"practicable door,\" which opened from\r\nthe passage on Church Alley.  Then I loaded my hand-cart\r\nwith my own chest and took it myself, in my working\r\nclothes, to the Vanderbilt Station, where I took a brass\r\ncheck for it.\r\n\r\nI could not wait for the Spaniard, but I left a\r\nletter for him, giving him a description of the way I\r\nmanaged the goats, and directions to milk and fatten\r\nthem, and to make both butter and cheese.\r\n\r\nAt half-past ten a \"crystal,\" as those cabs were then\r\ncalled, came to the corner of Fernando Street and Church\r\nAlley, and so we drove to the station.  I left the key of\r\nthe office, directed to the Spaniard, in the hands of the\r\nbaggage-master.\r\n\r\nWhen I took leave of my castle, as I called it, I\r\ncarried with me for relics the great straw hat I had\r\nmade, my umbrella, and one of my parrots; also I forgot\r\nnot to take the money I formerly mentioned, which had\r\nlain by me so long useless that it was grown rusty\r\nand tarnished, and could scarcely pass for money till it\r\nhad been a little rubbed and handled.  With these relics\r\nand with my wife's and mother's baggage and my own chest,\r\nwe arrived at our new home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBREAD ON THE WATERS\r\nA WASHINGTON CHRISTMAS\r\n\r\n[No.  This story also is \"Invented Example.\"  But it\r\nis founded on facts.  It is a pleasure to me, writing\r\nfifty-four years after the commission intrusted to me by\r\nthe late Mrs. Fales, to say that that is a real name, and\r\nthat her benevolence at a distance is precisely\r\nrepresented here.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the large history of the world would be\r\ndifferently written but for that kindness of hers.\r\n\r\nI was a very young clergyman, and the remittance she\r\nmade to me was the first trust of the same kind which had\r\never been confided to me.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER  I\r\n\r\nMAKE READY\r\n\r\n\"Only think, Matty, papa passed right by me when I was\r\nsitting with my back to the fire and stitching away on\r\nhis book-mark without my once seeing him!  But he was\r\nso busy talking to mamma that he never saw what I was\r\ndoing, and I huddled it under a newspaper before he\r\ncame back again.  Well, I have got papa's present done,\r\nbut I cannot keep out of mamma's way.  Matty, dear, if\r\nI will sit in the sun and keep a shawl on, may I not\r\nsit in your room and work?  It is not one bit cold\r\nthere.  Really, Matty, it is a great deal warmer\r\nthan it was yesterday.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dear child,\" said Matty, to whom everybody came so\r\nreadily for advice and help, \"I can do better for you\r\nthan that.  You shall come into the study; papa will be\r\naway all the morning, and I will have the fire kept up\r\nthere,--and mamma shall never come near you.\"\r\n\r\nAll this, and a thousand times more of plotting and\r\ncounterplotting, was going on among four children and\r\ntheir elders in a comfortable, free-and-easy seeming\r\nhousehold in Washington, as the boys and girls, young men\r\nand young women were in the last agonies of making ready\r\nfor Christmas.  Matty is fully entitled to be called a\r\nyoung woman, when we see her.  She has just passed her\r\ntwenty-first birthday.  But she looks as fresh and pretty\r\nas when she was seventeen, and certainly she is a great\r\ndeal pleasanter though she be wiser.  She is the oldest\r\nof the troop.  Tom, the next, is expected from Annapolis\r\nthis afternoon, and Beverly from Charlotte.  Then come\r\nfour boys and girls whose ages and places the reader must\r\nguess at as we go on.\r\n\r\nThe youngest of the family were still young enough to\r\nwrite the names of the presents which they would be glad\r\nto receive, or to denote them by rude hieroglyphs, on\r\nlarge sheets of paper.  They were wont to pin up these\r\nsheets on certain doors, which, by long usage in this\r\nfree-and-easy family, had come to be regarded as the\r\nbulletin-boards of the establishment.  Well-nigh\r\nevery range of created things had some representation on\r\nthese bulletins,--from an ambling pony round to a \"boot-\r\nbuttenner,\" thus spelled out by poor Laura, who was\r\nconstantly in disgrace, because she always appeared\r\nlatest at the door when the children started for church,\r\nto ride, or for school.  The youngsters still held to the\r\ntheory of announcing thus their wants in advance.  Horace\r\ndoubted whether he were not too old.  But there was so\r\nmuch danger that nobody would know how much he needed a\r\njig-saw, that he finally compromised with his dignity,\r\nwrote on a virgin sheet of paper, \"gig-saw,\" signed his\r\nname, \"Horace Molyneux, Dec. 21,\" and left his other\r\npresents to conjecture.\r\n\r\nAnd of course at the very end, as Santa Claus and his\r\nrevels were close upon them, while the work done had been\r\nwonderful, that which we ought to have done but which we\r\nhad left undone, was simply terrible.  Here were pictures\r\nthat must be brought home from the frame-man, who had\r\nnever pretended he would send them; there were ferns and\r\nlycopodiums in pots which must be brought home from the\r\ngreenhouse; here were presents for other homes, which\r\nmust not only be finished, but must be put up in paper\r\nand sent before night, so as to appear on other trees.\r\nEvery one of these must be shown to mamma, an approved by\r\nher and praised; and every one must be shown to dear\r\nMatty, and praised and approved by her.  And yet by\r\nno accident must Matty see her own presents or dream that\r\nany child has remembered her, or mamma see HERS or\r\nthink herself remembered.\r\n\r\nAnd Matty has all her own little list to see to,\r\nwhile she keeps a heart at leisure from itself to soothe\r\nand sympathize.  She has to correct the mistakes, to\r\nrepair the failures, to respect the wonder, to refresh\r\nthe discouragement, of each and all the youngsters.  Her\r\nown Sunday scholars are to be provided with their\r\npresents.  The last orders are to be given for the\r\nChristmas dinners of half-a-dozen families of vassals,\r\nmostly black or of some shade of black, who never forgot\r\ntheir vassalage as Christmas came round.  Turkey,\r\ncranberry, apples, tea, cheese, and butter must be sent\r\nto each household of these vassals, as if every member\r\nwere paralyzed except in the muscles of the jaw.  But,\r\nall the same, Matty or her mother must be in readiness\r\nall the morning and afternoon to receive the visits of\r\nall the vassals,--who, so far as this form of homage\r\nwent, did not seem to be paralyzed at all.\r\n\r\nFor herself, Matty took possession of the dining-\r\nroom, as soon as she could clear it of the breakfast\r\nequipage, of the children and of the servants, and here,\r\nwith pen and ink, with wrapping-paper and twine, with\r\ntelegraph blanks and with the directory, and with Venty\r\nas her Ariel messenger--not so airy and quick as Ariel,\r\nbut quite as willing--Matty worked her wonders, and\r\ngave her audiences, whether to vassals from without or\r\npuzzled children from within.\r\n\r\nVenty was short for Ventidius.  But this name, given\r\nin baptism, was one which Venty seldom heard.\r\n\r\nMatty corded up this parcel, and made Venty cord up\r\nthat; wrote this note of compliment, that of inquiry,\r\nthat of congratulation, and sent Venty on this, that, and\r\nanother errand with them; relieved Flossy's anxieties and\r\npoor Laura's in ways which have been described; made sure\r\nthat the wagon should be at the station in ample time for\r\nBeverly's arrival; and at last, at nearly one o'clock,\r\ncalled Aunty Chloe (who was in waiting on everybody as a\r\nsuperserviceable person, on the pretence that she was\r\nneeded), bade Aunty pick up the scraps, sweep the floor,\r\nand bring the room to rights.  And so, having attended to\r\neverybody beside herself, to all their wishes and hopes\r\nand fears, poor Matty--or shall I say, dear Matty--ran\r\noff to her own room, to finish her own presents and make\r\nher own last preparations.\r\n\r\nShe had kept up her spirits as best she could all the\r\nmorning, but, at any moment when she was alone, her\r\nspirits had fallen again.  She knew it, and she knew why.\r\nAnd now she could not hold out any longer.  She and her\r\nmother, thank God, never had any secrets.  And as she ran\r\nby her mother's door she could not help tapping, to be\r\nsure if she had come home.\r\n\r\nYes, she had come home.  \"Come in!\" and Matty ran in.\r\n\r\nHer mother had not even taken off her hat or her\r\ngloves.  She had flung herself on the sofa, as if her\r\nwalk had been quite too much for her; her salts and her\r\nhandkerchief were in her hands, and when she saw it was\r\nMatty, as she had hoped when she spoke, she would not\r\neven pretend she had not been in tears.\r\n\r\nIn a moment Matty was on her knees on the floor by\r\nthe sofa, and somehow had her left arm round about her\r\nmother's neck.\r\n\r\n\"Dear, dear mamma!  What is it, what is the matter?\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear, dear Matty,\" replied her mother, just\r\nsucceeding in speaking without sobs, and speaking the\r\nmore easily because she stroked the girl's hair and\r\ncaressed her as she spoke, \"do not ask, do not try to\r\nknow.  You will know, if you do not guess, only too soon.\r\nAnd now the children will be better, and papa will get\r\nthrough Christmas better, if you do not know, my\r\ndarling.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, dear mamma,\" said Matty, crossing her mother's\r\npurpose almost for the first time that she remembered,\r\nbut wholly sure that she was right in doing so,--\"No,\r\ndear mamma, it is not best so.  Indeed, it is not, mamma!\r\nI feel in my bones that it is not!\"  This she said with\r\na wretched attempt to smile, which was the more ghastly\r\nbecause the tears were running down from both their\r\nfaces.\r\n\r\n\"You see I have tried, mamma.  I knew all day\r\nyesterday that something was wrong, and at breakfast this\r\nmorning I knew it.  And I have had to hold up--with the\r\nchildren and all these people--with the feeling that any\r\nminute the hair might break and the sword fall.  And I\r\nknow I shall do better if you tell me.  You see the boys\r\nwill be here before dark, and of course they will see,\r\nand what in the world shall I say to them?\"\r\n\r\n\"What, indeed?\" said her poor mother.  \"Terrible it\r\nis, dear child, because your father is so wretched.  I\r\nhave just come from him.  He would not let me stay, and\r\nyet for the minute I was there, I saw that no one else\r\ncould come in to goad him.  Dear, dear papa, he is so\r\nresolute and brave, and yet any minute I was afraid that\r\nhe would break a blood-vessel and fall dead before me.\r\nOh, Matty, Matty, my darling, it is terrible!\"\r\n\r\nAnd this time the poor woman could not control\r\nherself longer, but gave way to her sobs, and her voice\r\nfairly broke, so that she was inarticulate, as she laid\r\nher cheek against her daughter's on the sofa.\r\n\r\n\"What is terrible?  Dear mamma, you must tell me!\"\r\n\r\n\"I think I must tell you, Matty, my darling.  I\r\nbelieve if I cannot tell some one, I shall die.\"\r\n\r\nThen Mrs. Molyneux told the whole horror to Matty.\r\nHere was her husband charged with the grossest\r\nplunder of the treasury, and now charged even in the\r\nHouse of Representatives.  It had been whispered about\r\nbefore, and had been hinted at in some of the lower\r\nnewspapers, but now even a committee of Congress had\r\nnoticed it, and had \"given him an opportunity to clear\r\nhimself.\"  There was no less a sum than forty-seven\r\nthousand dollars, in three separate payments, charged to\r\nhim at the Navy Department as long ago as the second and\r\nthird years of the Civil War.  At the Navy they had his\r\nreceipts for it.  Not that he had been in that department\r\nthen any more than he was now.  He was then chief clerk\r\nin the Bureau of Internal Improvement, as he was now\r\nCommissioner there.  But this was when the second Rio\r\nGrande expedition was fitted out; and from Mr. Molyneux's\r\nknowledge of Spanish, and his old connection with the\r\nSanta Fe trade, this particular matter had been intrusted\r\nto him.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, dear mamma!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, papa has it all down on his own cashbook; that\r\nbook he carries in his breast-pocket.  There are the\r\nthree payments, and then all the transfers he made to the\r\ndifferent people.  One, was that old white-haired\r\nSpaniard with the harelip, who used to come here at the\r\nback door, so that he should not be seen at the\r\nDepartment.  But it was before you remember.  The others\r\nwere in smaller sums.  But the whole thing was done in\r\nthree weeks, and then the expedition sailed, and papa had\r\nenough else to think of, and has never thought of it\r\nsince, till ten or fifteen days ago, when somebody in the\r\nEleventh Auditor's office discovered this charge, and his\r\nreceipt for this money.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, dear mamma?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, dear child, that is all, but that now the\r\nnewspapers have got hold of it, and the Committee on\r\nRetrenchment, who are all new men, with their reputations\r\nto make, have got hold of it, and some of them really\r\nthink, you know, that papa has stolen the money!\"  And\r\nshe broke down crying again.\r\n\r\n\"But he can show his accounts, mamma!\"  What are his\r\naccounts worth?  He must show the vouchers, as they are\r\ncalled.  He must show these people's receipts, and what\r\nhas become of these people; what they did with the money.\r\nHe must show everything.  Well, when the `Copperhead'\r\nfirst spoke of it--that was a fortnight ago--papa was\r\nreally pleased.  For he said it would be a good chance to\r\nbring out a piece of war history.  He said that in our\r\nBureau we had never had any credit for the Rio Grande\r\nsuccesses, that they were all our thunder; because\r\nTHEN he could laugh about this horrid thing.  He said\r\nthe Navy had taken all the boners, while we deserved them\r\nall.  And he said if these horrid `Copperhead' and\r\n`Argus' and `Scorpion' people would only publish the\r\nvouchers half as freely as they published the charges, we\r\nshould get a little of the credit that was our due.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, mamma, and what is the trouble now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, papa was so sure that he would do nothing until\r\nan official call came.  But on Monday it got into\r\nCongress.  That hairy man from the Yellowstone brought in\r\na resolution or something, and the Committee was ordered\r\nto inquire.  And when the order came down, papa told Mr.\r\nWaltsingham to bring him the papers, and, Matty, the\r\npapers were not there!\"\r\n\r\n\"Stolen!\" cried Matty, understanding the crisis for\r\nthe first time.\r\n\r\n\"Yes--perhaps--or lost--hidden somewhere.  You have\r\nno idea of the work of those days night work and all\r\nthat.  Many a time your father did not undress for a\r\nweek.\"\r\n\r\n\"And now he must remember where he put a horrid pile\r\nof papers, eleven, twelve years ago.  Mamma, that pile is\r\nstolen.  That odious Greenhithe stole it.  He lives in\r\nPhiladelphia now, and he has put up these newspapers to\r\nthis lie.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Greenhithe was an underclerk in the Internal\r\nImprovement Bureau, who had shown an amount of attention\r\nto Miss Matty, which she had disliked and had refused to\r\nreceive.  She had always said he was bad and would come\r\nto a bad end, and when he was detected in a low trick,\r\nselling stationery which he had stolen from the supply\r\nroom, and was discharged in disgrace, Matty had said it\r\nwas good enough for him.\r\n\r\nThese were her reasons for pronouncing at once\r\nthat he had stolen the vouchers and had started the\r\nrumors.\r\n\r\n\"I do not know.  Papa does not know.  He hardly tries\r\nto guess.  He says either way it is bad.  If the vouchers\r\nare stolen, he is in fault, for he is responsible for the\r\narchives; if he cannot produce the vouchers, then all the\r\ncountry is down on him for stealing.  I only hope,\" said\r\npoor Mrs. Molyneux, \"that they won't say our poor old\r\nwagon is a coach and six;\" and this time she tried to\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\nAnd now she had told her story.  All last night,\r\nwhile the children were asleep, Mr. Molyneux had been at\r\nthe office, even till four o'clock in the morning, taking\r\nold dusty piles from their lairs and searching for those\r\nwretched vouchers.  And mamma had been waiting--shall one\r\nnot say, had been weeping?--here at home.  That was the\r\nreason poor papa had looked so haggard at breakfast this\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nThis was all mamma had to tell.  She had been to the\r\noffice this morning, but papa would not let her stay.  He\r\nmust see all comers, just as if nothing had happened, was\r\nhappening, or was going to happen.\r\n\r\nWell! Matty did make her mother take off her jacket\r\nand her hat and her gloves.  She even made her drink a\r\nglass of wine and lie down.  And then the poor girl\r\nretired to her own room, with such appetite as she might\r\nfor taking the last stitches in worsted work, for\r\nstippling in the lights into drawings, for writing\r\nthe presentation lines in books, and for doing the\r\nthousand little niceties in the way of finishing touches\r\nwhich she had promised the children to do for them.\r\n\r\nHer dominant feeling--yes, it was a dominant passion,\r\nas she knew--was simply rage against this miserable\r\nGreenhithe, this cowardly sneak who was thus taking his\r\nrevenge upon her, because she had been so cold to him.\r\nOr was it that he made up to her because he was already\r\nin trouble at the Office and hoped she would clear him\r\nwith her father?  Either way he was a snake and a\r\nscorpion, but he had worked out for himself a terrible\r\nrevenge.  Poor Matty!  She tried to think what she could\r\ndo, how she could help, for that was the habit of her\r\nlife.  But this was now hard indeed.  Her mind would not\r\nnow take that turn.  All that it would turn to was to the\r\nwretched and worse than worthless question, what\r\npunishment might fall on him for such utter baseness and\r\nwickedness.\r\n\r\nAll the same the children must have their lunch, and\r\nthey must not know that anything was the matter.  Oh\r\ndear! this concealment was the worst of all!\r\n\r\nSo they had their lunch.  And poor Matty counselled\r\nagain, and helped again, and took the last stitches, and\r\nmended the last breaks, and waited and wondered, and\r\ntried to hope, till at five o'clock an office messenger\r\ncame up with this message.\r\n\r\n4.45 P.M.\r\nDEAR MATTY,--I shall not come up to dinner.  There is\r\npressing work here.  Tell mamma not to sit up for me.  I\r\nhave my key.\r\nI have no chance to get my things for the children.\r\nWill you see to it?  Here is twenty dollars, and if you\r\nneed more let them send in the bill.  I had only thought\r\nof that jig-saw--was it?--that Horace wants.  See that\r\nthe dear fellow has a good one.\r\n\r\nLove to all and ever yours,\r\n\r\nPAPA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Poor, dear papa,\" said Matty aloud, shedding tears\r\nin spite of herself.  \"To be thinking of jig-saws and\r\nchildren in all this horrid hunt!  As if hunting for\r\nanything was not the worst trial of all, always.\"  And at\r\nonce the brave girl took down her wraps and put on her\r\nwalking-shoes, that her father's commissions might be met\r\nbefore their six-o'clock dinner.  And she determined that\r\nfirst of all she would meet Tom at the station.\r\n\r\nAt the station she met Tom; that was well.  Matty had\r\nnot been charged to secrecy; that was well.  She told him\r\nall the story, not without adding her suspicions, and\r\ngiving him some notion of her rage.\r\n\r\nAnd Tom was angry enough,--there was a crumb of\r\ncomfort there.  But Tom went off on another track.  Tom\r\ndistrusted the Navy Department.  He had been long enough\r\nat Annapolis to doubt the red tape of the bureaus with\r\nwhich his chiefs had to do.  \"If the navy had the\r\nmoney, the navy had the vouchers,\" that was Tom's theory.\r\nHe knew a chief clerk in the navy, and Tom was going at\r\nonce round there.\r\n\r\nBut Matty held him in check at least for the moment.\r\nWhatever else he did, he must come home first; he must\r\nsee mamma and he must see the children, and he must have\r\ndinner.  She had not told him yet how well he looked, and\r\nhow handsome he was.\r\n\r\nBut after Tom had seen them he slipped off, pretended\r\nhe had unfinished preparations to make, and went right to\r\nthe Department, forced his way in because he was Mr.\r\nMolyneux's son, and found his poor father with Zeigler,\r\nthe chief clerk, still on this wretched and fruitless\r\noverhaul of the old files.  Tom stated frankly, in his\r\noff-hand, business-like way, what his theory was.\r\nNeither Zeigler nor Tom's father believed in it in the\r\nleast.  Tom knew nothing, they said; the Navy paid the\r\nmoney, but the Navy was satisfied with our receipt, and\r\nshould be.\r\n\r\nTom continued to say, \"If the Navy paid the money the\r\nNavy must have the vouchers;\" and at last, more to be rid\r\nof him than with any hope of the result, Mr. Molyneux let\r\nthe eager fellow go round to his friend, Eben Ricketts,\r\nand see if Eben would not give an hour or two of his\r\nChristmas to looking up the thing.  Mr. Molyneux even\r\nwent so far as to write a frank line to Mr. Ricketts, and\r\nenclosed a letter which he had had that day from the\r\nchairman of the House Committee,--a letter which was\r\nsmooth enough in the language, but horrible enough in the\r\nthing.\r\n\r\nAh me!  Had not Ricketts read it all already in the\r\nevening \"Argus\"?  He was willing, if he could, to serve.\r\nSo he with Tom went round and found the Navy Department\r\nmessenger, and opened and lighted up the necessary rooms,\r\nand they spent three hours of their Christmas there.\r\nMeanwhile Beverly had arrived from Norfolk.  He had a\r\nfrolic with the children, and then called his mother and\r\nMatty away from them.\r\n\r\n\"What in thunder is the matter?\" said the poor boy.\r\n\r\nAnd they told him.  How could they help telling him?\r\nAnd so soon as the story was finished, the boy had his\r\ncoat on and was putting on his boots.  He went right down\r\nto his father's office, he made old Stratton admit him,\r\nand told his father he too had reported for duty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nCHRISTMAS MORNING\r\n\r\nAnd at last Christmas morning dawned,--gray enough and\r\ngrim enough.\r\n\r\nIn that house the general presenting was reserved for\r\nevening after dinner,--when in olden days there had\r\nalways been a large Christmas-tree lighted and\r\ndressed for the children and their little friends.  As\r\nthe children had grown older, and the trees at the\r\nSunday-school and elsewhere had grown larger, the family\r\ntree had grown smaller, and on this day was to be simply\r\natypical tree, a little suggestion of a tree, between the\r\nfront windows; while most of the presents of every sort\r\nand kind were to be dispersed--where room could be made\r\nfor them--in any part of the front parlors.  All the\r\ngrand ceremonial of present-giving was thus reserved to\r\nthe afternoon of Christmas, because then it was certain\r\npapa would be at home, Tom and Beverly would both be\r\nready, and, indeed, as the little people confessed, they\r\nthemselves would have more chance to be quite prepared.\r\n\r\nBut none the less was the myth of Santa Claus and the\r\nstockings kept up, although that was a business of less\r\naccount, and one in which the children themselves had no\r\nshare, except to wonder, to enjoy, and to receive.  You\r\nwill observe that there is a duality in most of the\r\nenjoyments of life,--that if you have a long-expected\r\nletter from your brother who is in Yokohama, by the same\r\nmail or the next mail there comes a letter from your\r\nsister who is in Cawnpore.  And so it was of Christmas at\r\nthis Molyneux house.  Besides the great wonders, like\r\nthose wrought out by Aladdin's slave of the lamp, there\r\nwere the wonders, less gigantic but not less exquisite,\r\nof the morning hours, wrought out by the slave of\r\nthe ring.  How this series of wonders came about, the\r\nyoungest of the children did not know, and were still\r\nimaginative enough and truly wise enough not to inquire.\r\n\r\nWhile, then, the two young men and their father were\r\nat one or the other Department, now on step-ladders,\r\nhanding down dusty old pasteboard boxes, now under\r\ngaslights, running down long indexes with inquiring\r\nfingers and unwinking eyes, Matty and her mother watched\r\nand waited till eleven o'clock came, not saying much of\r\nwhat was on the hearts of both, but sometimes just\r\nrecurring to it, as by some invisible influence,--an\r\ninfluence which would overcome both of them at the same\r\nmoment.  For the mother and daughter were as two sisters,\r\nnot parted far, even in age, and not parted at all in\r\nsympathy.  For occupation, they were wrapping up in thin\r\npaper a hundred barley dogs, cats, eagles, locomotives,\r\nsuns, moons, and stars,--with little parcels of nuts,\r\nraisins, and figs, large red apples, and bright Florida\r\noranges,--all of which were destined to be dragged out of\r\ndifferent stockings at daybreak.\r\n\r\n\"And now, dear, dear mamma,\" said Matty, \"you will go\r\nto bed,--please do, dear mamma.\"  This was said as she\r\ncompelled the last obstinate eagle to accept his fate and\r\nstay in his wrapping-paper, from which he had more than\r\nonce struggled out, with the instincts of freedom.\r\n\r\n\"Please do, dear mamma; I will sort these all\r\nout, and will be quite sure that each has his own.\r\nAt least, let us come upstairs together.  I will comb\r\nyour hair for you; that is one of the little comforts.\r\nAnd you shall get into bed and see me arrange them, and\r\nif I do it wrong you can tell me.\"\r\n\r\nPoor mamma, she yielded to her--as who does not\r\nyield, and because it was easier to go upstairs than to\r\nstay.  And the girl led her up and made herself a toilet\r\nwoman indeed, and did put her worn-out mamma into bed,\r\nand then hurried to the laundry, where she was sure she\r\ncould find what Diana had been bidden to reserve there--a\r\npair of clean stockings belonging to each member of the\r\nfamily.  The youngest children, alas, who would need the\r\nmost room for their spread-eagles and sugar locomotives,\r\nhad the smallest feet and legs.  But nature compensates\r\nfor all things, and Matty did not fail to provide an\r\nextra pair of her mother's longest stockings for each of\r\n\"the three,\" as the youngest were called in the councils\r\nof their elders.  So a name was printed by Santa Claus on\r\na large red card and pinned upon each receptacle, FLOSSY\r\nor LAURA, while all were willing to accept of his\r\nbounties contained within, even if they did not recognize\r\nyarn or knitting as familiar.  Matty hurried back with\r\ntheir treasures.  She brought from her own room the large\r\nred tickets, already prepared, and then, on the floor by\r\nher mother's bedside, assorted the innumerable parcels,\r\nand filled each stocking full.\r\n\r\nDear girl! she had not wrongly guessed.  There was\r\njust occupation enough, and just little enough, for the\r\npoor mother's anxious, tired thought.  Matty was wise.\r\nShe asked fewer and fewer questions; fewer and fewer she\r\nmade her journeys to the great high fender, where she\r\npinned all these stiff models of gouty legs.  And when\r\nthe last hung there quietly, the girl had the exquisite\r\nsatisfaction of seeing that her mother was fast asleep.\r\nShe would not leave the room.  She turned the gas-light\r\ndown to a tiny bead.  She slipped off her own frock, put\r\non her mother's heavy dressing-gown, lay down quietly by\r\nher side without rousing her, and in a little while--for\r\nwith those so young this resource is well-nigh sure--she\r\nslept too.\r\n\r\nIt was five o'clock when she was wakened by her\r\nfather's hand.  He led her out into his own dressing-\r\nroom, and before she spoke she kissed him!\r\n\r\nShe knew what his answer would be.  She knew that\r\nfrom his heavy face.  But all the same she tried to\r\nsmile, and she said,\r\n\r\n\"Found?\"\r\n\r\n\"Found?  No, no, dear child, nor ever will be.  How\r\nis mamma?\"\r\n\r\nAnd Matty told him, and begged him to come and sleep\r\nin her own little room, because the children would come\r\nin in a rout at daybreak.  But no! he would not hear to\r\nthat.  \"Whatever else is left, dear Matty, we have each\r\nother.  And we will not begin--on what will be a new\r\nlife to all of us--we will not begin by 'bating a jot of\r\nthe dear children's joys.  Matty, that is what I have\r\nbeen thinking of all the way as I walked home.  But maybe\r\nI should not have said it, but that Beverly said it just\r\nnow to me.  Dear fellow!  I cannot tell you the comfort\r\nit was to me to see him come in!  I told him he should\r\nnot have come, but he knew that he made me almost happy.\r\nHe is a fine fellow, Matty, and all night long he has\r\nshown the temper and the sense of a man.\"\r\n\r\nFor a moment Matty could not say a word.  Her eyes\r\nwere all running over with tears.  She kissed her father\r\nagain, and then found out how to say, \"I shall tell him\r\nwhat you say, papa, and there will be two happy children\r\nin this house, after all.\"\r\n\r\nSo she ran to Beverly's room, found him before he was\r\nundressed, and told him.  And the boy who was just\r\nbecoming a man, and the girl who, without knowing it, had\r\nbecome a woman, kissed each other; held each other for a\r\nminute, each by both hands, looked each other so lovingly\r\nin the eyes, comforted each other by the infinite comfort\r\nof love, and then said good-night and were asleep.  Tom\r\nhad stolen to bed without waking his mother or his\r\nsister, some hours before.\r\n\r\nYes!  They all slept.  The little ones slept, though\r\nthey had been so certain that they should not sleep one\r\nwink from anxiety.  This poor jaded man slept\r\nbecause he must sleep.  His poor wife slept because she\r\nhad not slept now for two nights before.  And Matty and\r\nTom and Beverly slept because they were young and brave\r\nand certain and pure, and because they were between\r\nseventeen and twenty-two years of age.  This is all to\r\nsay that they could seek God's help and find it.  This is\r\nto say that they were well-nigh omnipotent over earthly\r\nills,--so far, at the least, that sleep came when sleep\r\nwas needed.\r\n\r\nBut not after seven o'clock!  Venty and Diana had\r\nbeen retained by Flossy and Laura to call them at five\r\nminutes of seven, and Laura and Flossy had called the\r\nothers.  And at seven o'clock, precisely, a bugle-horn\r\nsounded in the children's quarters, and then four\r\ngrotesque riders, each with a soldier hat made of\r\nnewspaper, each with a bright sash girt round a dressing-\r\ngown, each with bare feet stuck into stout shoes, came\r\nstorming down the stairs, and as soon as the lower floor\r\nwas reached, each mounted on a hobby-horse or stick, and\r\nwith riot not to be told came knocking at Matty's door,\r\nat Beverly's, and at Tom's.  And these all appeared, also\r\nwith paper soldier hats upon their heads, and girt in\r\nsome very spontaneous costume, and so the whole troop\r\nproceeded with loud fanfaron and drumbeat to mamma's door\r\nand knocked for admission, and heard her cheery \"Come\r\nin.\"  And papa and mamma had heard the bugle-calls, and\r\nhad wrapped some sort of shawls around their\r\nshoulders, and were sitting up in bed, they also with\r\npaper soldier hats upon them; and one scream of \"Merry\r\nChristmas\" resounded as the doors flew open,--and then a\r\nwild rampage of kissing and of hugging as the little ones\r\nrushed for the best places they could find on the bed--\r\nnot to say in it.  This was the Christmas custom.\r\n\r\nAnd Tom rolled up a lounge on one side of the bed,\r\nwhich after a fashion widened it, and Beverly brought up\r\nhis mother's easy-chair, which had earned the name of\r\n\"Moses' seat,\" on the other side, and thus, in a minute,\r\nthe great broad bed was peopled with the whole family, as\r\njolly, if as absurd, a sight as the rising sun looked\r\nupon.  And then!  Flossy and Beverly were deputed to go\r\nto the fender, and to bring the crowded, stiff stockings,\r\nwhose crackle was so delicate and exquisite; and so,\r\nyoungest by youngest, they brought forth their treasures,\r\nnot indeed gold, frankincense, and myrrh, but what\r\nanswered the immediate purposes better, barley cats,\r\ndogs, elephants and locomotives, figs, raisins, walnuts,\r\nand pecans.\r\n\r\nYes, and for one noisy half-hour not one person\r\nthought of the cloud which hung over the house only the\r\nnight before!\r\n\r\nBut such happy forgetfulness cannot last forever.\r\nThere was the Christmas breakfast.  And Tom tried to tell\r\nof Academy times, and Beverly tried to tell stories\r\nof the University.  But it was a hard pull.  The lines\r\nunder papa's eyes were only too dark.  And all of a\r\nsudden he would start, and ask some question which showed\r\nthat he did not know what they were talking of.  Matty\r\nhad taken care to have the newspapers out of the way; but\r\neverybody knew why they were out of the way,--and perhaps\r\nthis made things worse.  Poor blundering Laura must needs\r\nsay, \"That is the good of Christmas, that there are no\r\nhorrid newspapers for people to bother with,\" when\r\neverybody above Horace's age knew that there were papers\r\nsomewhere, and soon Horace was bright enough to see what\r\nhe had not been told in words,--that something was going\r\nwrong.\r\n\r\nAnd as soon as breakfast was done, Flossy cried out,\r\n\"And now papa will tell us the story of the bear!  Papa\r\nalways tells us that on Christmas morning.  Laura, you\r\nshall come; and, Horace, you shall sit there.\"  And then\r\nher poor papa had to take her up and kiss her, and say\r\nthat this morning he could not stop to tell stories, that\r\nhe had to go to the Department.  And then Flossy and\r\nLaura fairly cried.  It was too bad.  They hated the\r\nDepartment.  There never could be any fun but what that\r\nhorrid old Department came in.  And when Horace found\r\nthat Tom was going to the Department too, and that Bev\r\nmeant to go with him, he was mad, and said he did not see\r\nwhat was the use of having Christmas.  Here he had tin-\r\nfoil and plaster upstairs, and little Watrous had\r\nlent him a set of government medals, and they should have\r\nsuch a real good time if Bev would only stay.  He wished\r\nthe Department was at the bottom of the Potomac.  Matty\r\nfairly had to take the scolding boy out of the room.\r\n\r\nMr. Molyneux, poor fellow, undertook the soothing of\r\nFlossy.  \"Anyway, old girl, you shall meet me as you go\r\nto church, and we will go through the avenue together,\r\nand I will show you the new Topsy girl selling cigars at\r\nPierre's tobacco shop.  She is as big as Flossy.  She has\r\nnot got quite such golden hair, but she never says one\r\nword to her papa, because she is never cross to him.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's because he is never kind to her,\" said the\r\nquick child, speaking wiser than she knew.\r\n\r\nFor Matty, she got a word with Tom, and he too\r\npromised that they would be away from the Department in\r\ntime to meet the home party, and that all of them should\r\ngo to church together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER  III\r\n\r\nCHURCH AND SERMON\r\n\r\nAnd, accordingly, as Mrs. Molyneux with her little troop\r\ncrossed F Street, they met the gentlemen all coming\r\ntoward them.  They broke up into groups, and Tom and\r\nMatty got their first real chance for talk since they had\r\nparted the night before.  No!  Tom had found no clue\r\nat the Navy Department.  And although Eben Ricketts had\r\nbeen good as gold, and had stayed and worked with Tom\r\ntill long after midnight, Eben had only worked to show\r\ngood-will, for Eben had not the least faith that there\r\nwas any clue there.  Eben had said that if old Mr.\r\nWhilthaugh, who knew the archive rooms through and\r\nthrough, had not been turned out, they could do in\r\nfifteen minutes what had cost them six hours, and that\r\nold Mr. Whilthaugh, without looking, could tell whether\r\nit was worth while to look.  But old Mr. Whilthaugh had\r\nbeen turned out, and Eben, even, did not know precisely\r\nwhat had become of him.  He thought he had gone back into\r\nPennsylvania, where his wife came from, but he did not\r\nknow.\r\n\r\n\"But, Matty, if nothing turns up to-day, I go to\r\nPennsylvania to-morrow to find this old Mr. Whilthaugh.\r\nFor I shall die if I stay here; and all the Eben\r\nRickettses in the world will never persuade me that the\r\nvouchers are not in that archive-room.  If the Navy did\r\nthe work, the Navy must have the vouchers.\"\r\n\r\nThen Matty ventured to ask what she and her mother\r\nhad wondered about once and again,--why these particular\r\nbits of paper were so necessary.  Surely other vouchers,\r\nor certified copies, or books of account could be found\r\nsomewhere!\r\n\r\n\"Yes! I know; you would say so.  And if it were all\r\nyesterday, and was all in these lazy times of peace,\r\nyou would say true.  But you see, in the first place,\r\nthis is ever so long ago.  Then, in the second place, it\r\nwas in the heat of war, when everything was on a gigantic\r\nscale, and things had to be done in unheard-of ways.\r\nThen, chiefly, this particular business involved the\r\nbuying up of I do not know who among the Rebels there in\r\nTexas, and among their allies on the other side the Rio\r\nGrande.  This old Spaniard, whom mamma remembers, and\r\nwhom I just remember, he was the chief captain among the\r\nturncoats, and there were two or three others, F. F. men\r\nin their places,--\"First Family men,\" that means, you\r\nknow; but after they did this work they did not stay in\r\ntheir places long.  No! papa says he was mighty careful;\r\nthat he had three of the scoundrels sworn before\r\nnotaries, or rather before one notary, and had their\r\nreceipts and acknowledgments stamped with his notary's\r\nseal.  Still, it did not do to have a word said in public\r\nthen.  And after everything succeeded so perfectly, after\r\nthe troops landed without a shot, and found all the base\r\nready for them, corn and pork just where they wanted\r\nit,--why, then everybody was too gratified to think of\r\nimagining, as they do now, that papa had stolen that\r\nmoney that bought the pork and the corn.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish they were only half as grateful now,\" he\r\nsaid, after a pause.\r\n\r\n\"Tom,\" said Matty, eagerly, \"who was that notary?\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought of that, too,\" said Tom.  \"There is no\r\ndoubt who it was.  It was old Gilbert; you must remember\r\nhis sign, just below Faulkner's on the avenue.  But in\r\nthe first place, Gilbert died just after our taking\r\nRichmond.  In the second place, he never knew what the\r\npapers were--and he executed twenty such sets of papers\r\nevery day, very likely.  All he could say, at the very\r\nbest, would be that at such a time father brought in an\r\nold Spaniard and two or three other greasers, and that he\r\ntook their acknowledgments of something.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not know that, Tom,\" said the girl, without\r\nflinching at his mannish information.  \"If notaries in\r\nWashington are anything like notaries in novels, that man\r\nkept a record or register of his work.  If he was not\r\nvery unlike everybody else who lives and works here, he\r\nleft a very destitute widow when he died.  Tom, I shall\r\ngo after church and hunt up the Widow Gilbert.  I shall\r\nask her for her husband's books, and shall tell her why\r\nI want them.\"\r\n\r\nThe girl dropped her voice and said:  \"Tom, I shall\r\nask her IN HIS NAME.\"\r\n\r\n\"God grant it does any good, dear girl,\" said he.\r\n\"Far be it from me to say that you shall not try--\"\r\n\r\nBut here he stopped speaking, for he felt Matty's arm\r\nshake in his, and her whole frame trembled.  Tom had only\r\nto keep his eyes before him to see why.\r\n\r\nMr. Greenhithe, Matty's old admirer, the clerk who\r\nhad been dismissed for stealing, was just entering the\r\nchurch, and even touched his hat to her as she went by.\r\n\r\nTom resisted his temptation to thrash him then and\r\nthere.  He said,--\r\n\r\n\"Matty, I believe I will tackle that man!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Tom!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Matty, I can keep my temper, and he cannot keep\r\nhis.  He has one advantage over most knaves, that he is\r\nnot only a knave of the first water, but he is sometimes\r\na fool, too.  If it were only decent and right to take\r\nhim into Downing's saloon, and give him just one more\r\nglass of whiskey than the blackguard would care to pay\r\nfor, I could get at his whole story.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, Tom, I thought you were so sure the Navy had\r\nthe papers!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well! well!\" said Tom, a little annoyed, as eager\r\npeople are when other eager people remember their words\r\nagainst them.  \"I was sure--I was wholly sure--till I\r\nleft Eben Ricketts.  But after that--well, of course, we\r\nought to pull every string.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tom!\"  This with a terrible gulp.\r\n\r\n\"Tom, you don't think I ought to speak with him!\"\r\n\r\n\"Matty!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, Tom, yes; if he does know--if he is holding\r\nthis up in terror, Tom, I could make him do what I chose\r\nonce, Tom.  You don't think I ought to try?\"\r\n\r\n\"Matty, if you ever speak to that snake again, I will\r\nthrash him within an inch of his life, and I will never\r\nsay a word to you as long as you live.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's my dear Tom!\"  And, hidden as they were, and\r\ncrying as she was under her veil, she flung her arms\r\naround him and kissed him.\r\n\r\n\"All the same,\" said Tom, after he had kissed her\r\nagain and again,--\"all the same, I shall find out, after\r\nchurch, where the snake is staying.  I shall go to the\r\nhotel and take a cigar.  I shall offer him one, and he is\r\nso mean and stingy that he will take it.  Perhaps this\r\nmay be one of his fool days.  Perhaps somebody else will\r\ntreat him to the whiskey.  No, Matty! honor bright, _I_\r\nwill not, though that ten cents might give us all a Merry\r\nChristmas.  Honor bright, I will not treat.  But I am not\r\na saint, Matty!  If anybody else treats, I must not be\r\nexpected to be far away.\"\r\n\r\nThen he wiped her eyes with his own handkerchief and\r\nled her in to the service.  Their own pew was already\r\nfull.  He had to take her back into Dr. Metcalf's pew.\r\n\r\nSo Matty was spared one annoyance which was prepared\r\nfor her.\r\n\r\nDirectly in front of her father's pew, sitting in the\r\nmost conspicuous seat on the other side of the aisle, was\r\nthe hateful Mr. Greenhithe.\r\n\r\nHad he put himself there to watch Matty's face?\r\n\r\nIf he did, he was disappointed.  If he had\r\npersuaded himself he was to see a pale cheek or\r\ntearful eyes, or that he was going to compel her to drop\r\nher veil, he had reckoned quite without his host.\r\nWhenever he did look that way, all he saw was the face of\r\nMaster Horace.  Horace was engaged in counting the large\r\ntassels on his side of the pulpit curtains; in counting,\r\nalso, the number of small tassels between them, and from\r\nthe data thus obtained, in calculating how many tassels\r\nthere must be on all the curtains to the pulpit, and how\r\nmany on the curtains behind the rail to the chancel.  Mr.\r\nGreenhithe, therefore, had but little comfort in studying\r\nHorace's face.\r\n\r\nJust as the Creed was finished, when the rest of the\r\nchurch was still, the sexton led up the aisle a grim-\r\nlooking man, with a shaggy coat and a very dirty face,\r\nand brought him close to the door of Mr. Molyneux's pew--\r\nas if he would fain bring him in.  Mr. Molyneux was at\r\nthe end of the pew, but happened to be turning away from\r\nthe aisle, and the sexton actually touched him.  He\r\nturned round and looked at the stranger,--evidently did\r\nnot know him,--but with the instinct of hospitality,\r\nstepped into the aisle and offered him his seat.  The\r\nstranger was embarrassed; hesitated as if he would speak,\r\nthen shook his head in refusal of the attention, and\r\ncrossing the aisle, took a seat offered him there, in\r\nfull sight of Mr. Molyneux, and, indeed, of Matty.\r\n\r\nPoor girl!  The trifle--of course it was a trifle--\r\nupset her sadly.\r\n\r\nWas the man a marshal or a sheriff?  Would they\r\nreally arrest her father on Christmas Day, in church?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nIS THIS CHRISTMAS?\r\n\r\nYes; it was, as you have said, a very curious Christmas\r\nservice for all those people.\r\n\r\nWhat Horace turned his mind to, at intervals, has\r\nbeen told.\r\n\r\nOf the elder members of our little company who sat\r\nthere near the head of the side aisle, it may be said, in\r\ngeneral, that they did their best to keep their hearts\r\nand minds engaged in the service, and that sometimes they\r\nsucceeded.  They succeeded better while they could really\r\njoin in the hymns and the prayers than they did when it\r\ncame to the sermon.  Good Dr. Gill, overruled by one of\r\nthose lesser demons, whose work is so apparent though so\r\ninexplicable in this finite world, had selected for the\r\ntext of his sermon of gladness the words, \"Search and\r\nlook.\"  And so it happened--it was what did not often\r\nhappen with him--he must needs repeat those words often,\r\nat the beginning and end, indeed, of every leading\r\nparagraph of the sermon.  Now this duty of searching and\r\nlooking had been just what all the elder members of\r\nthe Molyneux family had been solidly doing--each in his\r\nway or hers, directly or by sympathy--in the last forty-\r\neight hours.  To get such relief as they might from it,\r\nthey had come to church, to look rather higher if they\r\ncould.  So that it was to them more a misfortune than a\r\nmatter of immediate spiritual relief that their dear old\r\nfriend, who loved each one of them with an intimate and\r\npeculiar love, happened to enlarge on his text just as he\r\ndid.\r\n\r\nIf poor Mr. Molyneux, by dint of severe self-command,\r\nhad succeeded in abstracting his thoughts from disgrace\r\nalmost certain,--from thinking over, in horrible variety,\r\nthe several threads of inquiry and answer by which that\r\ndisgrace was to be avoided or precipitated,--how was it\r\npossible to maintain such abstraction, while the worthy\r\npreacher, wholly unconscious of the blood he drew with\r\nevery word, ground out his sentences in such words as\r\nthese:--\r\n\r\n\"Search and look, my brethren.  Time passes faster\r\nthan we think.  Our gray hairs gather apace above our\r\nforeheads.  And the treasure which we prized beyond price\r\nin years bygone has perhaps, amid the cares of this\r\nworld, or in the deceitfulness of riches, been thrust on\r\none side, neglected, at last forgotten.  How is it with\r\nyou, dear friends?  Are you the man?  Are you the woman?\r\nHave you put on one side the very treasure of your\r\nlife,--as some careless housewife might lay aside on\r\na forgotten shelf this parcel or that, once so precious\r\nto her?  Dear friends, as the year draws to a close,\r\nawaken from such neglect!  Brush away the dust from these\r\nforgotten caskets!  Lift them from their hiding-places\r\nand set them forth, even in your Christmas festivities.\r\nSearch and look!\"\r\n\r\nPoor Mrs. Molyneux had never wished before so\r\nearnestly that a sermon might be done.  She dared not\r\nlook round to see her husband for a while, but after one\r\nof these invocations--not quite so terrible as the rest,\r\nperhaps--she stole a glance that way, to find--that she\r\nmight have spared her anxiety.  Two nights of \"searching\r\nand looking\" had done their duty by the poor man, and\r\nthough his head was firm braced against the column which\r\nrose from the side of their pew, his eyes were closed,\r\nand his wife was relieved by the certainty that he was\r\nlistening, as those happy members of the human family\r\nlisten who assure me that they hear when their lids are\r\ntight pressed over their eyeballs.  As for Beverly, he\r\nwas assuming the resolute aspect of a sailor under fire,\r\nand was imagining himself taking the whole storm of Fort\r\nConstantine as he led an American squadron into the Bay\r\nof Sevastopol.  Tom did not know what the preacher said,\r\nbut was devising the method of his interview with\r\nGreenhithe.  Matty did know.  Dear girl! she knew very\r\nwell.  And with every well-rounded sentence of the sermon\r\nshe was more determined as to the method of her\r\nappeal to Mrs. Gilbert, the widow of the notary.  She\r\nwould search and look there.\r\n\r\nYes! and it was well for every one of them that they\r\nwent to that service.  The sermon at the worst was but\r\ntwenty minutes.  \"Twenty minutes in length,\" said\r\nBeverly, wickedly, \"and no depth at all.\"  But that was\r\nnot true nor fair; nor was that, either way, the thing\r\nthat was essential.  By the time they had all sung\r\n\r\n\"Praise God from whom all blessings flow,\"\r\n\r\neven before the good old Doctor had asked for Heaven's\r\nblessing upon them, it had come.  To Mr. Molyneux it\r\nhad come in an hour's rest of mind, body, and soul.  To\r\nMatty it had come in an hour's calm determination.  To\r\nMrs. Molyneux it had come in the certainty that there\r\nis One Eye which sees through all hiding-places and\r\nbehind all disguises.  To the children it had come,\r\nbecause the hour had called up to them a hundred memories\r\nof Galilee and Nazareth, of Mary Mother, and of children\r\nmade happy, to supplement and help out their legends of\r\nSanta Claus.  Yes, and even Beverly the brave, and Tom\r\nthe outraged, as they stood to receive the benediction of\r\nthe preacher, were more of men and less of firebrands\r\nthan they were.  They all stood with reverence; they\r\npaused a moment, and then slowly walked down the aisle.\r\n\r\n\"Where is your father, Horace?\" said Mrs. Molyneux,\r\na little anxiously, as she came where she could\r\nspeak aloud.  Horace was waiting for her.\r\n\r\n\"Papa?  He went away with the gentleman who came in\r\nafter service began; they crossed the street and took a\r\ncarriage together.\"\r\n\r\n\"And did papa leave no message?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, no; he did not turn round.  The strange man--\r\nthe man in the rough coat--just touched him and spoke to\r\nhim half-way down the aisle.  Then papa whispered to him\r\nand he whispered back.  Then, as soon as they came into\r\nthe vestibule here, papa led him out at that side door,\r\nand did not seem to remember me.  They almost ran across\r\nthe street, and took George Gibb's hack.  I knew the\r\nhorses.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's too bad,\" said Laura; \"I thought papa would\r\nwalk home with us and tell us the story of the bears.\"\r\n\r\nPoor Mrs. Molyneux thought it was too bad, too; but\r\nshe said nothing.\r\n\r\nAnd Matty, when she joined her mother, said,--\r\n\r\n\"I shall feel a thousand times happier, mamma, if I\r\ngo and see Mrs. Gilbert now.\"  And she explained who Mrs.\r\nGilbert was.  \"Perhaps it may do some good.  Anyway, I\r\nshall feel as if I were doing something.  I will be home\r\nin time to finish the tree and things, for Horace will\r\nlike to help me.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the poor girl looked her entreaties so eagerly\r\nthat her mother could not but assent to her plan.\r\nSo she made Beverly go up the avenue with her,--Beverly,\r\nwho would have swum the Potomac and back for her, had she\r\nasked him,--as he was on his way to join his father at\r\nthe Bureau.\r\n\r\nAs they came out upon the broad sidewalk, that odious\r\nGreenhithe, with some one whom Beverly called a\r\nblackguard of his crew, pushed by them, and he had the\r\nimpudence to turn and touch his hat to Matty again.\r\n\r\nMatty's hand trembled on Beverly's arm, but she would\r\nnot speak for a minute, only she walked slower and\r\nslower.\r\n\r\nThen she said:  \"I am so afraid, Bev, that Tom and he\r\nwill get into a quarrel.  Tom declares he will go into\r\nWillard's and find out whether he does know anything.\"\r\n\r\nBut Beverly, very mannish, tried to reassure her and\r\nmake her believe that Tom would be very self-restrained\r\nand perfectly careful.\r\n\r\nOn Christmas Day the Jew's dry-goods store, which had\r\ntaken the place of old Mr. Gilbert's notary's office, was\r\nclosed--not perhaps so much from the Israelite's\r\nenthusiasm about Christmas as in deference to what in New\r\nEngland is called \"the sense of the street.\"  Matty,\r\nhowever, acting from a precise knowledge of Washington\r\nlife, rang boldly at the green door adjacent, Beverly\r\nstill waiting to see what might turn up; and when a brisk\r\n\"colored girl\" appeared, Matty inquired if Mrs. Munroe\r\nwas at home.\r\n\r\nNow all that Matty knew of Mrs. Munroe was that her\r\nname was on a well-scoured brass plate on the door.\r\n\r\nMrs. Munroe was in.  Beverly said he would wait in\r\nthe passage.  Mrs. Munroe proved to be a nice, motherly\r\nsort of a person, who, as it need hardly be said, was\r\nstone-deaf.  It required some time for Matty to adjust\r\nher speaking apparatus to the exigency, but when this was\r\ndone, Mrs. Munroe explained that Mr. Gilbert was dead,--\r\nthat an effort had been made to continue the business\r\nwith the old sign and the old good will, under the\r\ndirection of a certain Mr. Bundy, who had sometimes been\r\ncalled in as an assistant.  But Mr. Bundy, after some\r\nyears, paid more attention to whiskey than he did to\r\nnotarying, and the law business had suffered.  Finally,\r\nMr. Bundy was brought home by the police one night with\r\na broken head, and then Mrs. Gilbert had withdrawn the\r\nsigns, cancelled the lease, turned Mr. Bundy out-of-\r\ndoors, and retired to live with a step-sister of her\r\nbrother's wife's father near the Arsenal; good Mrs.\r\nMunroe was not certain whether on Delaware Avenue, or\r\nwhether on T Street, U Street, or V Street.  And, indeed,\r\nwhether the lady's name were Butman before she married\r\nher second husband, and Lichtenfels afterward--or whether\r\nhis name were Butman and hers Lichtenfels, Mrs. Munroe\r\nwas not quite sure.  Nor could she say whether Mr.\r\nGilbert took the account books and registers --there\r\nwere heaps on heaps of them, for Mr. Gilbert had been a\r\nnotary ever since General Jackson's day--or whether Bundy\r\ndid not take them, or whether they were not sold for old\r\npaper, Mrs. Munroe was not sure.  For all this happened--\r\nall the break-up and removal--while Mrs. Munroe was on a\r\nvisit to her sister not far from Brick Church above\r\nLittle Falls, on your way to Frederic.  And Mrs. Munroe\r\noffered this visit as a constant apology for her not\r\nknowing more precisely every detail of her old friend's\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nThis explanation took a good deal of time, through\r\nall of which poor Beverly was fretting and fuming and\r\nstamping his cold feet in the passage, hearing the\r\noccasional questions of his sister, uttered with thunder\r\ntone in the \"setting-room\" above, but hearing no word of\r\nthe placid widow's replies.\r\n\r\nWhen Matty returned and held a consultation with him,\r\nthe question was, whether to follow the books of account\r\nto Georgetown, where Mr. Bundy was understood to be still\r\nresiding, or to the neighborhood of the Arsenal, in the\r\nhope of finding Mrs. Gilbert, Mrs. Lichtenfels, or Mrs.\r\nButman, as the case might be.  Readers should understand\r\nthat these two points, both unknown to the young people,\r\nare some six miles asunder, the original notary's office\r\nbeing about half-way between them.  Beverly was more\r\ndisposed to advise following the man.  He was of a mind\r\nto attack some one of his own sex.  But the\r\nenterprise was, in truth, Matty's enterprise.  Beverly\r\nhad but little faith in it from the beginning, and Matty\r\nwas minded to follow such clue as they had to Mrs.\r\nGilbert, quite sure that, woman with woman, she should\r\nsucceed better with her than, man with man, Beverly with\r\nBundy.  Beverly assented to this view the more willingly,\r\nbecause Matty was quite willing to undertake the quest\r\nalone.  She was very brave about it indeed.  \"Plenty of\r\nnice people at the Arsenal,\" or near it, whom she could\r\nfall back upon for counsel or information.  So they\r\nparted.  Matty took a street car for the east and south,\r\nand Beverly went his ways to the Bureau of Internal\r\nImprovement to report for duty to his father.\r\n\r\nThis story must not follow the details of Matty's\r\nquest for the firm of \"Gilbert, Lichtenfels, or Butman.\"\r\nCertain it is that she would never have succeeded had she\r\nrested simply on the directory or on such crude\r\ninformation as Mrs. Munroe had so freely given.  But\r\nMatty had an English tongue in her head,--a courteous,\r\nwhich is to say a confiding, address with strangers; she\r\nseemed almost to be conferring a favor at the moment when\r\nshe asked one, and she knew, in this business, that there\r\nwas no such word as fail.  After one or two false\r\nstarts--some very stupid answers, and some very blunt\r\nrefusals--she found her quarry at last, by as simple a\r\nprocess as walking into a Sunday-school of colored\r\nchildren, where she heard singing in the basement of\r\na little chapel.\r\n\r\nIn a few words Matty explained her errand to the\r\nSuperintendent, and that it was necessary that she should\r\nfind Mrs. Gilbert before dark.\r\n\r\n\"Ting!\" one stroke of the bell called hundreds of\r\neager voices to silence.\r\n\r\n\"Who knows where Mrs. Gilbert lives?  Is it at Mrs.\r\nButman's house or Mrs. Lichtenfels'?\"\r\n\r\nTwenty eager hands contended with each other for the\r\nhonor of giving the information, and in three minutes\r\nmore, Matty, all encouraged by her success, was on her\r\nway.\r\n\r\nAnd Mrs. Gilbert was at home.  Good fortune number\r\ntwo!  Matty's star was surely in the ascendant!  Matty\r\nsent in her card, and the nice old lady presented herself\r\nat once, remembered who Matty was, remembered how much\r\nbusiness Mr. Molyneux used to bring to the office, and\r\nhow grateful Mr. Gilbert always was.  She was so glad to\r\nsee Matty, and she hoped Mr. Molyneux was well, and Mrs.\r\nMolyneux and all those little ones!  She used to see them\r\nevery Sunday as they went to church, if they went on the\r\navenue.\r\n\r\nThus encouraged, Matty opened on her sad story, and\r\nwas fairly helped from stage to stage by the wonder,\r\nindignation, and exclamations of the kind old lady.  When\r\nMatty came to the end, and made her understand how much\r\ndepended on the day-book, register, and ledger of her\r\nhusband, it was a fair minute before she spoke.\r\n\r\n\"We will see, my dear, we will see.  I wish it may be\r\nso, but I 'm all afeard.  It would not be like him, my\r\ndear.  It would not be like any of them.  But come with\r\nme, my dear, we will see--we will see.\"\r\n\r\nThen, as Matty followed her, through devious ways,\r\nout through the kitchen, across a queer bricked yard,\r\ninto a half stable, half woodshed, which the good woman\r\nunlocked, she went on talking:--\r\n\r\n\"You see, my dear child, that though notaries are\r\ncalled notaries, as if it were their business to give\r\nnotice, the most important part of their business is\r\nkeeping secrets.  Now, when a man's note goes to protest,\r\nthe notary tells him what has happened, which he knew\r\nvery well before; and then he comes to the notary and\r\nbegs him not to tell anybody else, and of course he does\r\nnot.  And the business of a notary's account books, as my\r\nhusband used to say, is to tell just enough, and not to\r\ntell any more.\r\n\r\n\"Why, my dear child, he would not use blotting-paper\r\nin the office,--he would always use sand.  `Blotting-\r\npaper!  Never!' he would say; 'Blotting-paper tells\r\nsecrets!'\"\r\n\r\nWith such chatter they came to the little chilly\r\nroom, which was shelved all around, and to Matty's glad\r\neyes presented rows of green and blue and blue and red\r\nboxes,--and folio and quarto books of every date, from\r\n1829 to 1869, forty years in which the late Mr. Gilbert\r\nhad been confirming history, keeping secret what he\r\nknew, but making sure what, but for him, might have been\r\ndoubted by a sceptic world.\r\n\r\nThings were in good order.  Mrs. Gilbert was proud to\r\nshow that they were in good order.  The day-book for 1863\r\nwas at hand.  Matty knew the fatal dates only too well.\r\nAnd the fatal entries were here!\r\n\r\nHow her heart beat as she began to read!\r\n\r\n                                                           Cr.\r\n   To Thomas Molyneux Esq., (B. I. I.) official\r\n       authentication of signature of Felipe Gazza .  .  . $1.25\r\n   Same, authentication of signature of Jose B. Du\r\n       Camara . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  1.25\r\n   Same, authentication of signature of Jacob H.\r\n       Cole . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  1.25\r\n\r\nAnd this was all!  Poor Matty copied it all, but all the\r\ntime she begged Mrs. Gilbert to tell her if there was not\r\nsome note-book or journal that would tell more.  And kind\r\nMrs. Gilbert looked eagerly for what she called the\r\n\"Diry.\"  At the proper dates on the cash-book, at\r\nintervals of a week or two, Matty found similar entries--\r\nthe names of the two Spaniards appearing in all these--\r\nbut other names in place of Cole's just as Tom had told\r\nher already.  By the time she had copied all of these,\r\nMrs. Gilbert had found the \"Diry.\"  Eager, and yet heart-\r\nsick, Matty turned it over with her old friend.\r\n\r\nThis was all:--\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Molyneux here.  Very private.  Papers in R. G. E.\"\r\nAnd then followed a little burst of unintelligible\r\nshort-hand.\r\n\r\nPoor Matty!  She could not but feel that here would\r\nnot be evidence good for anything, even in a novel.  But\r\nshe copied every word carefully, as a chief clerk's\r\ndaughter should do.  She thanked the kind old lady, and\r\neven kissed her.  She looked at her watch.  Heavens! how\r\nfast time had gone! and the afternoons were so short!\r\n\r\n\"Yes, my dear Miss Molyneux; but they have turned, my\r\ndear, the day is a little longer and a little lighter.\"\r\n\r\nDid the old lady mean it for an omen, or was it only\r\none of those chattering remarks on meteors and weather\r\nchange of which old age is so fond?  Matty wondered, but\r\ndid not know.  Fast as she could, she tripped bravely on\r\nto the avenue for her street car.\r\n\r\n\"The day is longer and lighter.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Tom was following his clue in the public\r\nrooms at Willard's, to which, as he prophesied, Mr.\r\nGreenhithe had returned after the unusual variation in\r\nhis life of a morning spent in the sanctuary.  Tom bought\r\na copy of the Baltimore \"The Sun,\" and went into one of\r\nthe larger rooms resorted to by travellers and loafers,\r\nand sat down.  But Mr. Greenhithe did not appear there.\r\nTom walked up and down through the passages a little\r\nuneasily, for he was sure the ex-clerk had come into the\r\nhotel.  He went up and looked in at the ladies'\r\nsitting-rooms, to see if perhaps some Duchess of\r\nDevonshire, of high political circles, had found it worth\r\nwhile to drag Mr. Greenhithe up there by a single hair.\r\nNo Mr. Greenhithe!  Tom was forced to go down and drink\r\na glass of beer to see if Mr. Greenhithe was not thirsty.\r\nBut at that moment, though Mr. Greenhithe was generally\r\nthirsty in the middle of the day, and although many men\r\nwere thirsty at the time Tom hung over his glass of\r\nlager, Mr. Greenhithe was not thirsty there.  It was only\r\nas Tom passed the billiard-room that he saw Mr.\r\nGreenhithe was playing a game of billiards, by way of\r\ncelebrating the new birth of a regenerated world.\r\n\r\nWhat to do now!  Tom could not, in common decency, go\r\nin to look on at the game of a man he wanted to choke.\r\nYet Tom would have given all his chances for rank in the\r\nAcademy to know what Greenhithe was talking about.  Tom\r\nslowly withdrew.\r\n\r\nAs he withdrew, whom should be meet but one of his\r\nkindest friends, Commodore Benbow?  When the boys made\r\ntheir \"experimental cruise\" the year before, they had\r\nfound Commodore Benbow's ship at Lisbon.  The Commodore\r\nhad taken a particular fancy to Tom, because he had known\r\nhis mother when they were boy and girl.  Tom had even\r\nbeen invited personally to the flag-ship, and was to have\r\nbeen presented at Court, but that they sailed too soon.\r\n\r\nTo tell the whole truth, the Commodore was not\r\noverpleased to see his protege hanging about the bar\r\nand billiard-room on Christmas Day.  For himself, his\r\nwhole family were living at Willard's, but he knew Tom's\r\nfather was not living there, and he thought Tom might be\r\nbetter employed.\r\n\r\nPerhaps Tom guessed this.  Perhaps he was in despair.\r\nAnyway he knew \"Old Benbow,\" as the boys called him,\r\nwould be a good counsellor.  In point of statistics \"Old\r\nBenbow\" was just turned forty, had not a gray hair in his\r\nhead, could have beaten any one of Tom's class, whether\r\nin gunning or at billiards, could have demonstrated every\r\nproblem in Euclid while they were fiddling over the\r\nforty-seventh proposition.  He was at the very prime of\r\nwell-preserved power, but young nineteen called him \"Old\r\nBenbow,\" as young nineteen will, in such cases.\r\n\r\nBold with despair, or with love for his father, Tom\r\nstopped \"Old Benbow\" and asked him if he would  come into\r\none of the sitting-rooms with him.  Then he made this\r\nvenerable man his confidant.  The Commodore had seen the\r\nslurs in the \"Scorpion\" and the \"Argus\" and the \"Evening\r\nJournal.\"  \"A pity,\" said he, \"that Newspaper Row, that\r\ncan do so much good, should do so much harm.  What is\r\nNewspaper Row?  Three or four men of honor, three or four\r\ndreamers, three or four schoolboys, three or four fools,\r\nand three or four scamps.  And the public, Molyneux,--\r\nwhich is to say you and I,--accept the trumpet blast\r\nof one of these heralds precisely as we do that of\r\nanother.  Practically,\" said he, pensively, \"when we were\r\ndetached to serve with the 33d Corps in Mobile Bay, I\r\nfound I liked the talk of those light-infantry men who\r\nhad been in every scrimmage of the war, quite as much as\r\nI did that of the bandmen who played the trumpets on\r\nparade.  But this is neither here nor there.  I thought\r\nof coming round to see your father, but I knew I should\r\nbother him.  What can I do, my boy?\"\r\n\r\nThen Tom told him, rather doubtfully, that he had\r\nreason to fear that Mr. Greenhithe was at the bottom of\r\nthe whole scandal.  He said he wished he did not think\r\nthat Mr. Greenhithe had himself stolen the papers.  \"If\r\nI am wrong, I want to know it,\" said he; \"if I am right,\r\nI want to know it.  I do not want to be doing any man\r\ninjustice.  But I do not want to keep old Eben Ricketts\r\ndown at the department hunting for a file of papers which\r\nGreenhithe has hidden in his trunk or put into the fire.\"\r\n\r\n\"No!--no!--no, indeed,\" said \"old Benbow,\" musing.\r\n\"No!--No!--No!--\"\r\n\r\nThen after a pause, \"Tom,\" said he, \"come round here\r\nin an hour.  I know that young fellow your friend is\r\nplaying with, and I wish he were in better company than\r\nhe is.  I think I know enough of the usages of modern\r\nsociety to `interview' him and his companion, though\r\ntimes have changed since I was of your age in that\r\nregard.  Come here in an hour, or give me rather more,\r\ncome here at half-past two, and we will see what we\r\nwill see.\"\r\n\r\nSo Tom went round to the Navy Department, and here he\r\nfound the faithful Eben--faithful to him, though utterly\r\nfaithless as to any success in the special quest which\r\nwas making the entertainment of the Christmas holiday.\r\nVainly did Tom repeat to him his formula,--\r\n\r\n\"If the Navy did the work, the Navy has the vouchers.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear boy,\" Eben Ricketts repeated a hundred\r\ntimes, \"though the Navy did the work, the Navy did not\r\nprovide the pork and beans; it did not arrange in advance\r\nfor the landing, least of all did it buy the greasers.\r\nI will look where you like, for love of your father and\r\nyou; but that file of vouchers is not here, never was\r\nhere, and never will be found here.\"\r\n\r\nAn assistant like this is not an encouraging\r\ncompanion or adviser.\r\n\r\nAnd, in short, the vouchers were not found in the\r\nNavy Department, in that particular midday search.  At\r\ntwenty-five minutes past two Tom gave it up unwillingly,\r\nbade Eben Ricketts good-by, washed from his hands the\r\naccretions of coal-dust, which will gather even on\r\nletter-boxes in Navy Departments, and ran across in front\r\nof the President's House, to Willard's.  He looked up at\r\nthe White House, and wondered how the people there were\r\nspending their Christmas Day.\r\n\r\nCommodore Benbow was waiting for him.  He took him up\r\ninto his own parlor.\r\n\r\n\"Molyneux, your Mr. Greenhithe is either the most\r\ningenious liar and the best actor on God's earth, or he\r\nknows no more of your lost papers than a child in heaven.\r\n\r\n\"I went back to the billiard-room, after you left me.\r\nI walked up to Millet--that was Lieutenant Millet playing\r\nwith Greenhithe--and I shook hands.  He had to introduce\r\nme to your friend.  Then I asked them both to come here,\r\ntold Millet I had some papers from Montevideo that he\r\nwould be glad to see, and that I should be glad of a call\r\nwhen they had done their game.  Well, they came.  I am\r\nsorry to say your friend--\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, don't, my dear Commodore Benbow, don't call him\r\nmy friend, even in a joke; it makes me feel awfully.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am glad it does,\" said the Commodore, laughing.\r\n\"Well, I am very sorry to say that the black sheep had\r\nbeen drinking more of the whisky downstairs than was good\r\nfor him; and, no fault of mine, he drank more of my\r\nMadeira than he should have done, and, Tom, I do not\r\nbelieve he was in any condition to keep secrets.  Well,\r\nfirst of all, it appeared that he had been in Bremen and\r\nVienna for six months.  He only arrived in New York\r\nyesterday morning.\"\r\n\r\nTom's face fell.\r\n\r\n\"And, next--you may take this for what it is worth--\r\nbut I believe he spoke the truth for once; he\r\ncertainly did if there is any truth in liquor or in\r\nswearing.  For when I asked Millet what all this stuff\r\nabout your father meant, Greenhithe interrupted, very\r\nunnecessarily and very rudely, and said, with more oaths\r\nthan I will trouble you with, that the whole was a damned\r\nlie of the newspaper men; that they had lied about him\r\n(Greenhithe) and now were lying about old Molyneux; that\r\nMolyneux had been very hard on him and very unjust to\r\nhim, but he would say that he was honest as the clock--\r\nhonest enough to be mean.  And that he would say that to\r\nthe committee, if they would call on him, and so on and\r\nso on.\"\r\n\r\n\"Much good would he do before the committee,\" said\r\npoor Tom.\r\n\r\nAnd thus ended Tom's branch of the investigation.\r\n\"Come to me, if I can help you, my boy,\" said Old Benbow.\r\n\"It is always the darkest, old fellow, the hour before\r\nday.\"\r\n\r\nTom was astronomer enough to know that this old saw\r\nwas as false as most old saws.  But with this for his\r\nonly comfort, he returned to the bureau to seek Beverly\r\nand his father.\r\n\r\nNeither Beverly nor his father was there!  Tom went\r\ndirectly home.  His mother was eager to see him.\r\n\r\nShe had come home alone, and, save Horace and Laura\r\nand Flossy and Brick, she had seen nobody but a messenger\r\nfrom the bureau.\r\n\r\nBrick was the family name for Robert, one of the\r\nyoungest of this household.\r\n\r\nOf Beverly's movements the story must be more briefly\r\ntold.  They took more time than Tom's; as much indeed as\r\nhis sister's, after they parted.  But they were conducted\r\nby means of that marvel of marvels, the telegraph,--the\r\nchief of whose marvels is that it compels even a long-\r\nwinded generation like ours to speak in very short metre.\r\n\r\nBeverly began with Mr. Bundy at Georgetown.\r\nGeorgetown is but a quiet place on the most active of\r\ndays.  On Christmas Day Beverly found but little stirring\r\nout of doors.\r\n\r\nStill, with the directory, with the advice of a\r\nsaloon-keeper and the information of a police officer,\r\nBeverly tracked Mr. Bundy to his lair.\r\n\r\nIt was not a notary's office, it was a liquor shop of\r\nthe lowest grade, with many badly painted signs, which\r\nexplained that this was \"Our House,\" and that here Mr.\r\nBundy made and sold with proper license--let us be\r\ngrateful--Tom and Jerry, Smashes, Cocktails, and did\r\nother \"deeds without a name.\"  On this occasion, however,\r\neven the door of \"Our House\" was closed.  Mr. Bundy had\r\ngone to a turkey-shooting match at Fairfax Court House.\r\nThe period of his return was very doubtful.  He had never\r\ndone anything but keep this drinking-room since old Mrs.\r\nGilbert turned him out of doors.\r\n\r\nWith this information Master Beverly returned to\r\ntown.  He then began on his own line of search.  Relying\r\non Tom's news, he went to the office of the Western\r\nUnion Telegraph and concocted this despatch, which he\r\nthought a masterpiece.\r\n\r\nGREENSBURG, Westmoreland Co., Pa.\r\n\r\nTO ROBERT JOHN WHILTHAUGH:\r\n\r\nWhen and where can I see you on important business?\r\nAnswer.\r\n\r\nBEVERLY MOLYNEUX, for THOMAS MOLYNEUX.\r\n\r\n\r\nThen he took a walk, and after half an hour called at\r\nthe office again.  The office was still engaged in\r\ncalling Greensburg.  Greensburg was eating its Christmas\r\ndinner.  But at last Greensburg was called.  Then Beverly\r\nreceived this answer:--\r\n\r\nWhilthaugh has been dead more than a year.\r\nGREENSBURG.\r\n\r\nTo which Beverly replied:--\r\n\r\nWhere does his wife live, or his administrator?\r\n\r\nTo which Greensburg, having been called a second time\r\nwith difficulty, replied:--\r\n\r\nHis wife is crazy, and we never heard of any property.\r\nGREENSBURG.\r\n\r\nWith this result of his investment as a non-dividend\r\nmember of the great Western Union Mutual Information\r\nClub, Beverly returned home, chewing the cud of sweet and\r\nbitter fancies.\r\n\r\n\"There is no speech nor language,\" sang the choir in\r\nSt. Matthews as he passed, \"where their voice is not\r\nheard.  Their line is gone out through all the\r\nearth--\"  And Tom heard no more, as he passed on.\r\n\r\nAs he walked, almost unwillingly, up the street to\r\nthe high steps of his father's house, Matty, out of\r\nbreath, overtook him.\r\n\r\n\"What have you found, Bev?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing,\" said the boy, moodily.  And poor Matty had\r\nto confess that she had hardly more to tell.\r\n\r\nThey came into the house by the lower entrance, that\r\nthey need not attract their mother's attention.  But she\r\nwas on the alert.  Even Horace and the younger children\r\nknew by this time that something was wrong.\r\n\r\nHorace's story about the strange man and papa was the\r\nlast news of papa.  Papa had not been at the bureau.  The\r\nbureau people waited for him till two, and he did not\r\ncome.  Then Stratton had come round to see if he was to\r\nkeep open any longer.  Stratton had told Mrs. Molyneux\r\nthat her husband had not been there since church.\r\n\r\nWhere in the world was he?\r\n\r\nPoor Mrs. Molyneux had not known where to send or to\r\ngo.  She had just looked in at the Doctor's, but he was\r\nnot there.\r\n\r\nTom had appeared first to her tedious waiting.  Tom\r\nwould not tell her, but he even went and looked in on\r\nNewspaper Row, which he had been abusing so.  For Tom's\r\nfirst thought was that a formal information had been\r\nlodged somewhere, and that his father was arrested.\r\n\r\nBut Newspaper Row evidently was unsuspicious of any\r\narrest.\r\n\r\nTom even walked down to the old jail, and made an\r\nabsurd errand to see the Deputy-Marshal.  But the Deputy-\r\nMarshal was at his Christmas dinner.\r\n\r\nTom told all this in the hall to Beverly and to\r\nMatty.\r\n\r\nEverything had failed, and papa was gone.  Who could\r\nthe man in the shaggy coat be?\r\n\r\nThe three went together into the parlor.\r\n\r\nFor a little, Matty and Horace and Tom and Beverly\r\nthen made a pretence of arranging the tree.  But, in\r\ntruth, Mrs. Molyneux, in the midst of all her care, had\r\ndone that, while they were all away.\r\n\r\nDinner was postponed half an hour, and they gathered,\r\nall in the darkness, looking at the sickliest blaze that\r\never rambled over half-burned Cumberland coal.\r\n\r\nThe Brick came climbing up on Tom's knees and bade\r\nhim tell a story; but even Laura saw that something was\r\nwrong, and hushed the child, and said she and Flossy\r\nwould sing one of their carols.  And they sang it, and\r\nwere praised; and they sang another, and were praised.\r\nBut then it was quite dark, and nobody had any heart to\r\nsay one word.\r\n\r\n\"Where is papa?\" said the Brick.\r\n\r\n\"Where indeed?\" everybody wanted to say, and no one\r\ndid.\r\n\r\nBut then the door-bell rang, and Chloe brought in a\r\nnote.\r\n\r\n\"He's waiting for an answer, mum.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Tom lighted the gas.  It popped up so bright that\r\nlittle Flossy said,--\r\n\r\n\"The people that sat in darkness saw a great light--\"\r\n\r\nThis was just as Mrs. Molyneux tore open the note.\r\nFor the instant she could not speak.  She handed it to\r\nthe three.\r\n\r\n\"FOUND\r\n\"Home in half an hour!\r\n\"All right! thank God!\r\nT. M.\"\r\n\r\n\"Saw a great light, indeed!\" said Horace, who, for\r\nonce, felt awed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHIS IS CHRISTMAS\r\n\r\nFor half a minute, as it seemed afterwards, no one\r\nspoke.  Then Matty flew to her mother, and flung her\r\narms around her neck, and kissed her again and again.\r\n\r\nTom hardly knew what he was doing; but he recovered\r\nself-command enough to know that he must try to be manly\r\nand businesslike,--and so he rushed downstairs to find\r\nthe man who brought the note.  It proved to be a man he\r\ndid not know.  Not a messenger from the bureau, not one\r\nfrom the Navy Department, least of all, an aid of\r\nthe Assistant Marshal's.  He was an innocent waiter from\r\nthe Seaton House, who said a gentleman called him and\r\ngave him the note, told him to lose no time, and gave him\r\nhalf a dollar for coming.  He had asked for an answer,\r\nthough the gentleman had not told him to do so.\r\n\r\nTom wrote:  \"Hurrah!  All's well!  All at home.--T.\"\r\nand gave this note to the man.\r\n\r\nThey all talked at once, and then they sat still\r\nwithout talking.  The children--must it be confessed?--\r\nasked all sorts of inopportune questions.  At last Tom\r\nwas even fain to tell the story of the bear himself, by\r\nway of silencing the Brick and Laura; and with much\r\ncorrection from Horace, had got the bear well advanced in\r\nsmelling at the almond-candy and the figs, when a\r\ncarriage was heard on the street, evidently coming\r\nrapidly towards them.  It stopped at the door.  The bear\r\nwas forgotten, as all the elders in this free-and-easy\r\nfamily rushed out of the parlor into the hall.\r\n\r\nPapa was there, and was as happy as they.  With papa,\r\nor just behind him, came in the man with the rough coat,\r\nwhose face at church had been so dirty, whose face now\r\nwas clean.  To think that papa should have brought the\r\nDeputy-Marshal with him!  For by the name of \"the Deputy-\r\nMarshal\" had this mysterious stranger been spoken of in\r\nprivate by the two young men since the fatal theory had\r\nbeen advanced that he had come into the church to arrest\r\nMr. Molyneux.\r\n\r\nThe unknown, with great tact, managed to keep in the\r\nbackground, while Mrs. Molyneux kissed her husband, and\r\nwhile Matty kissed him, and while among them they pulled\r\noff his coat.  But Mr. Molyneux did not forget.  He made\r\na chance in a moment for saying, \"You must speak to our\r\nfriend who has brought me here; no one was ever so\r\nwelcome at a Christmas dinner.  Mr. Kuypers, my dear, Mr.\r\nKuypers, Matty dear; these are my boys, Mr. Kuypers.\"\r\n\r\nThen the ladies welcomed the stranger, and the boys\r\nshook hands with him.  Mr. Molyneux added, what hardly\r\nany one understood:  \"It is not every friend that travels\r\ntwo thousand miles to jog a friend's memory.\"\r\n\r\nAnd they all huddled into the parlor.  But in a\r\nmoment more, Mrs. Molyneux had invited Mr. Kuypers to go\r\nupstairs to wash himself, and he, with good feeling,\r\nwhich he showed all the evening, gladly took himself out\r\nof the way, and so, as Tom returned from showing him to\r\nhis room, the parlor was filled with \"those God made\r\nthere,\" as the little boy used to say, and with none\r\nbeside.\r\n\r\n\"Now tell us all about it, dear papa,\" cried Tom.\r\n\r\n\"I was trying to tell your mother.  But there is not\r\nmuch to tell.  Poor Mr. Kuypers had travelled all the way\r\nfrom Colorado, the minute he heard I was in trouble.\r\nYesterday he bought the `Scorpion' in the train, and\r\nfound the Committee was down on us.  He drove here from\r\nthe station as soon as the train came in.  He missed you\r\nhere, and drove by mistake to Trinity.  That made\r\nhim late with us, and so, as the service had begun, he\r\nwaited till it was done.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well!\" said Bev, perhaps a little impatiently.\r\n\r\n\"But so soon as we were going out he touched me, and\r\nsaid he had come to find me, in the matter of the Rio\r\nGrande vouchers.  Do you know, Eliza, I can afford to\r\nlaugh at it now, but at the moment I thought he was a\r\ndeputy of the Sergeant-at-Arms?\"\r\n\r\n\"There!\" screamed Tom, \"I said he was a deputy-marshal!\"\r\n\r\n\"I said, `Certainly;' and I laughed, and said they\r\nseemed to interest all my friends.  Then he said, `Then\r\nyou have them?  If I had known that, I would have spared\r\nmy journey.'  This threw me off guard, and I said I\r\nsupposed I had them, but I could not find them.  And he\r\nsaid eagerly--this was just on the church steps--`But I\r\ncan.'\r\n\r\n\"Then he said he had a carriage waiting, and he bade\r\nme jump in.\r\n\r\n\"So soon as we were in the carriage he explained,\r\nwhat I ought to have remembered, but could not then\r\nrecollect for the life of me, that after General Trebou\r\nreturned from Texas, there was a Court of Inquiry, and\r\nthat there was some question about these very supplies,\r\nthe beans and the coffee particularly; they had nothing\r\nto do with the landing nor with the Mexicans.  And the\r\nCourt of Inquiry sent over one day from the War\r\nDepartment, where they were sitting, to our office for an\r\naccount, because we were said to have it.  Mr.\r\nKuypers was their messenger to us, and because we had\r\nbound them all together, the whole file was sent as it\r\nwas.  He took them, and as it happened, he looked them\r\nover, and what was better, he remembered them.  Where our\r\nreceipt is, Heaven knows!\r\n\r\n\"Well, that Court of Inquiry was endless, as those\r\narmy inquiries always are.  Mr. Kuypers was in attendance\r\nall the time.  He says he never shall forget it, if other\r\npeople do.\r\n\r\n\"So, as soon as he saw that we were in trouble at the\r\nbureau--that I was in trouble, I mean,\" said Mr.\r\nMolyneux, stoutly, \"he knew that he knew what nobody else\r\nknew,--that the vouchers were in the papers of that Court\r\nof Inquiry.\"\r\n\r\n\"And he came all the way to tell?  What a good\r\nfellow!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, he came on purpose.  He says he could not help\r\ncoming.  He says he made two or three telegrams; but\r\nevery time he tried to telegraph, he felt as if he were\r\nshirking.  And I believe he was right.  I believe we\r\nshould never have pulled through without him.  `Personal\r\npresence moves the world,' as Eli Thayer used to say.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you found them?\" asked Mrs. Molyneux, faintly\r\nessaying to get back to the story.\r\n\r\n\"Oh Yes, we found them; but not in one minute.  You\r\nsee, first of all, I had to go to the chief clerk at the\r\nWar Department and get the department opened on a\r\nholiday.  Then we had no end of clerks to disturb at\r\ntheir Christmas dinners, and at last we found a good\r\nfellow named Breen who was willing to take hold with Mr.\r\nKuypers.  And Mr. Kuypers himself,\" here he dropped his\r\nvoice, \"why, we have not three men in all the departments\r\nwho know the history of this government or the system of\r\nits records as he does.\r\n\r\n\"Once in the office, he went to work like a master.\r\nBreen was amazed.  Why!  We found those documents in less\r\nthan half an hour!\r\n\r\n\"Then I sent Breen with a note to the Secretary.  He\r\nwas good as gold; came down in his own carriage,\r\ncongratulated me as heartily--well almost as heartily as\r\nyou do, Tom--and took us both round, with the files, to\r\nMr. McDermot, the Chairman of the House Committee.  He\r\nwas dining with his mess, at the Seaton House, but we\r\ncalled him out, and I declare, I believe he was as much\r\npleased as we were.\r\n\r\n\"I only stopped to make him give me a receipt for the\r\npapers, because they all said it was idle to take copies,\r\nand here we are!\"\r\n\r\nOn the hush that followed, the Brick made his way up\r\non his father's knee and said,--\r\n\r\n\"And now, papa, will you tell us the story of the\r\nbear?  Tom does not tell it very well.\"\r\n\r\nThey all laughed,--they could afford to laugh now;\r\nand Mr. Molyneux was just beginning upon the story of the\r\nbear, when Mr. Kuypers reappeared.  He had in this short\r\ntime revised his toilet, and looked, Mr. Molyneux said in\r\nan aside, like the angel of light that he was.  \"Bears!\"\r\nsaid he, \"are there any bears in Washington?  Why,\r\nit was only last Monday that I killed a bear, and I ate\r\nhim on Tuesday.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you eat him all?\" asked the Brick, whose\r\nreverence for Mr. Kuypers was much more increased by this\r\nstory than by any of the unintelligible conversation\r\nwhich had gone before.  But just as Mr. Kuypers began on\r\nthe story of the bear, Chloe appeared with beaming face,\r\nand announced that dinner was ready.\r\n\r\nThat dinner, which this morning every one who had any\r\nsense had so dreaded, and which now seemed a festival\r\nindeed!\r\n\r\nWell! there was great pretence in fun and form in\r\nmarshalling.  And Mr. Kuypers gave his arm to Matty, and\r\nHorace his to Laura, and Beverly his to Flossy, and Tom\r\nbrought up the rear with the Brick on his shoulders.  And\r\nMr. Molyneux returned thanks and asked a blessing all\r\ntogether.  And then they fell to, on the turkey and on\r\nthe chicken pie.  And they tried to talk about Colorado\r\nand mining; about Gold Hill and Hale-and-Norcross, and\r\nUncle Sam and Overman and Yellow Jacket.  But in spite of\r\nthem all, the talk would drift back to Bundy and his\r\nvarious signs, \"Our House\" and Tom and Jerry; to the wife\r\nof Mr. Whilthaugh; to Commodore Benbow; to old Mrs.\r\nGilbert and Delaware Avenue.  And this was really quite\r\nas much the fault of Mr. Kuypers as it was of any of the\r\nMolyneux family.  He seemed as much one of them as did\r\nTom himself.  This anecdote of failure and that of\r\nsuccess kept cropping out.  Walsingham's high-bred and\r\ndignified enthusiasm for the triumph of the office, and\r\nthe satisfaction that Eben Ricketts would feel when he\r\nwas told that the Navy never had the vouchers,--all were\r\ncommented on.  Then Mr. Molyneux would start and say, \"We\r\nare talking shop again.  You say the autumn has been mild\r\nin the mountains;\" and then in two minutes they would be\r\non the trail of \"Search and Look\" again.\r\n\r\nIt was in one of these false starts that Mr. Kuypers\r\nexplained why he came, which in Horace's mind and perhaps\r\nin the minds of the others had been the question most\r\npuzzling of all.\r\n\r\n\"Why,\" said Horace, bluntly, \"had you ever heard of\r\npapa before!\"\r\n\r\n\"Had I heard of him? \" said Mr. Kuypers.  \"I think\r\nso.  Why, my dear boy, your father is my oldest and\r\nkindest friend!\"  At this exclamation even Mrs. Molyneux\r\nshowed amazement.  Tom laid down his fork and looked to\r\nsee if the man was crazy, and Mr. Molyneux himself was\r\nthrown off his balance.\r\n\r\nMr. Kuypers was a well-bred man, but this time he\r\ncould not conceal his amazement.  He laid down knife and\r\nfork both, looked up and almost laughed, as he said with\r\nwonder,--\r\n\r\n\"Don't you know who I am?\"\r\n\r\n\"We know you are our good angel to-day,\" said Mrs.\r\nMolyneux, bravely; \"and that is enough to know.\"\r\n\r\n\"But don't you know why I am here, or what sent me?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Molyneux said that he understood very well that\r\nhis friend wanted to see justice done, and that he had\r\npreferred to see to this in person.\r\n\r\n\"I thought you looked queer,\" said Mr. Kuypers,\r\nfrankly; \"but still, I did not know I was changed.  Why,\r\ndon't you remember Bruce?  You remember Mrs. Chappell,\r\nsurely.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you Bruce?\" cried Mr. Molyneux; and he fairly\r\nleft his chair and went round the table to the young man.\r\n\"Why, I can see it now.  But then--why, you were a boy,\r\nyou know, and this black beard--\"\r\n\r\n\"But pray explain, pray explain,\" cried Tom.  \"The\r\nmysteries increase on us.  Who is Mrs. Chappell, and, for\r\nthat matter, who is Bruce, if his real name be not\r\nKuypers?\"\r\n\r\nAnd they all laughed heartily.  People got back their\r\nself-possession a little, and Mr. Kuypers explained.\r\n\r\n\"I am Bruce Kuypers,\" said he, \"though your father\r\ndoes not seem to remember the Kuypers part.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Mr. Molyneux, \"I cannot remember the\r\nKuypers part, but the Bruce part I remember very well.\"\r\n\r\n\"My mother was Mrs. Kuypers before she married Mr.\r\nChappell, and Mr. Chappell died when my brother Ben was\r\nsix years old, and little Lizzy was a baby.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lizzy was my godchild,\" said Mrs. Molyneux, who now\r\nremembered everything.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly she was, Mrs. Molyneux, and last month\r\nLizzy was married to as good a fellow as ever presided\r\nover the melting of ingots.  We marry them earlier at the\r\nWest than you do here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where Lizzie would have been,\" he said more gravely,\r\naddressing Tom again, \"where my mother would have been,\r\nor where I should have been but for your father and\r\nmother here, it would be hard to tell.  And all to-day I\r\nhave taken it for granted that to him, as to me, this has\r\nbeen one part of that old Christmas!  Surely you\r\nremember?\" he turned to Mrs. Molyneux.\r\n\r\nYes, Mrs. Molyneux did remember, but her eyes were\r\nall running over with tears and she did not say so.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Molyneux,\" said Bruce Kuypers, again addressing\r\nTom, \"seventeen years ago this blessed day, there was a\r\nChristmas morning in the poor old tenement above\r\nMassachusetts Avenue such as you never saw, and such as\r\nI hope you never may see.\r\n\r\n\"There was fire in the stove because your father had\r\nsent the coal.  There was oatmeal mush on the table\r\nbecause your father paid my mother's scot at your\r\nfather's grocer.\r\n\r\n\"But there was not much jollity in that house, and\r\nthere were no Christmas presents, but what your mother\r\nhad sent to Bruce and Ben and Flora, and even to the\r\nbaby.  Still we kept up such courage as we could.\r\nIt was a terribly cold day, and there was a wet storm.\r\n\r\n\"All of a sudden a carriage stopped at the door, and\r\nin came your father here.  He came to say that that day's\r\nmail had brought a letter from Dr. Wilder of the navy,\r\nconveying the full certificate that William Chappell's\r\ndeath was caused by exposure in the service.  That\r\ncertificate was what my mother needed for her pension.\r\nShe never could get it, but your father here had sifted\r\nand worried and worked.  The `Macedonian' arrived\r\nThursday at New York, and had Dr. Wilder on board, and\r\nFriday afternoon your father had Wilder's letter, and he\r\nleft his own Christmas dinner to make light my mother's\r\nand mine.  That was not all.  Your father, as he came,\r\nhad stopped to see Mr. Birdsall, who was the Speaker of\r\nthe House.  He had seen the Speaker before, and had said\r\nkind things about me.  And that day the Speaker told him\r\nto tell me to come and see him at his room at the Capitol\r\nnext day.  Oh! how my mother dressed me up!  Was there\r\never such a page seen before!  What with your father's\r\nkind words and my dear mother's extra buttons, the\r\nSpeaker made me his own page the next day, and there I\r\nserved for four years.  It was then that I was big enough\r\nto go into the War Department, and Mr. Goodsell--he was\r\nthe next Speaker, if you remember--recommended me there.\r\n\r\n\"After that,\" said Bruce Kuypers, modestly, if I did\r\nnot see you so often, but I used to see you\r\nsometimes, and I did not think\"--this with a roguish\r\ntwinkling of the eye--\"that you forgot your young friends\r\nso soon.\"\r\n\r\n\"I remember you,\" said Tom.  \"I used to think you\r\nwere the grandest man in Washington.  You gave me the\r\nfirst ride on a sled I ever had, when there was some\r\nexceptional fall of snow.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think we all remember Mr. Kuypers now,\" said\r\nMatty, and she laughed while she blushed; \"he always\r\nbought things for our stockings.  I have a Noah's Ark\r\nupstairs now, that he gave me. In my youngest days I had\r\na queer mixture of the name Bruce and the name Santa\r\nClaus.  I believe I thought Santa Claus' name was\r\nNicholas Bruce.  I am sure I did not know that Mr. Bruce\r\nhad any other name.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you had said you were Mr. Chappell,\" said Mr.\r\nMolyneux, \"I should have known you in a minute.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I was not,\" said the young man, laughing.\r\n\r\n\"Well, if you had said you were `Bruce,' I should\r\nhave known.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dear me, yes; but I have been a man so long, and at\r\nGem City nobody calls me Bruce, but my mother and Lizzy.\r\nSo I said `Mr. Kuypers,' forgetting that I had ever been\r\na boy.  But now I am in Washington again, I shall\r\nremember that things change here very fast in ten years.\r\nAnd yet not so fast as they change at the mines.\"\r\n\r\nAnd now everybody was at ease.  How well Mrs.\r\nMolyneux recalled to herself what she would not\r\nspeak of that Christmas Day of which Mr. Kuypers told his\r\nstory!  It was in their young married life.  She had her\r\nfather and mother to dine with her, and the event was\r\nreally a trial in her young experience.  And then, just\r\nas the old folks were expected, her husband came dashing\r\nin and had asked her to put dinner a little later because\r\nhe had had this good news for the poor Widow Chappell,\r\nand she had to tell her father and mother, when they\r\ncame, that they must all wait for his return.\r\n\r\nThe Widow Chappell was one of those waifs who seem\r\nattracted to Washington by some fatal law.  It had been\r\ntwo or three months before that Mr. Molyneux had been\r\nasked to hunt her up and help her.  A letter had come,\r\nasking him to do this, from Mrs. Fales, in Roxbury, and\r\nMrs. Fales had sent money for the Chappells.  But the\r\nmoney had gone in back rent, and shoes, and the rest, and\r\nthe wolf was very near the Chappells' door, when the\r\ntelegraph announced the \"Macedonian.\"  Mr. Molyneux had\r\ntelegraphed instanter to this Dr. Wilder.  Dr. Wilder had\r\nsome sense of Christmas promptness.  He remembered poor\r\nChappell perfectly, and mailed that night a thorough\r\ncertificate.  This certificate it was which Mr. Molyneux\r\nhad carried to the poor old tenement of Massachusetts\r\nAvenue, and this had made happy that Christmas Day--and\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n\"Why,\" said Mr. Bruce Kuypers, almost as if he were\r\nspeaking aloud, \"it seems so queer that Christmas\r\ncomes and goes with you, and you have forgotten all about\r\nthat stormy day, and your ride to Mrs. Chappell's!\r\n\r\n\"Why, at our place, we drink Mr. Molyneux's health\r\nevery Christmas Day, and I am afraid the little ones used\r\nto think that you had a red nose, a gray beard, and came\r\ndown the chimney!\"\r\n\r\n\"As, at another place,\" said Matty, \"they thought of\r\nMr. Bruce--of Noah's Ark memory.\"\r\n\r\n\"Anyway,\" said Mr. Molyneux, \"any crumbs of comfort\r\nwe scattered that day were BREAD UPON THE WATERS.\"\r\n\r\nOf Mr. Kuypers's quick journey the main points have\r\nbeen told.  Six days before, by some good luck, which\r\ncould hardly have been expected, the \"Gem City Medium's\"\r\ndespatch from Washington was full enough to be\r\nintelligible.  It was headed, \"ANOTHER SWINDLER NAILED.\"\r\nIt said that Mr. Molyneux, of the Internal Improvement\r\noffice, had feathered his nest with $500,000 during\r\nthe war, in a pretended expedition to the Rio Grande.  It\r\nhad now been discovered that there never was any such\r\nexpedition, and the correspondent of the Associated Press\r\nhoped that justice would be done.\r\n\r\nThe moment Bruce Kuypers read this he was anxious.\r\nBefore an hour passed he had determined to cross to the\r\nPacific train eastward.  Before night he was in a\r\nsleeping-car.  Day by day as he met Eastern papers, he\r\nsearched for news of the investigation.  Day by day he\r\nmet it, but thanks to his promptness he had arrived in\r\ntime.  It was pathetic to hear him describe his\r\nanxiety from point to point, and they were all hushed to\r\nsilence when he told how glad he was when he found he\r\nshould certainly appear on Christmas Day.\r\n\r\nAfter the dinner, another procession, not wholly\r\nunlike the rabble rout of the morning, moved from the\r\ndining-room to the great front parlor, where the tree was\r\nlighted, and parcels of gray and white and brown lay\r\nround on mantel, on piano, on chairs, on tables, and on\r\nthe floor.\r\n\r\nNo; this tale is too long already.  We will not tell\r\nwhat all the presents were to all the ten,--to Venty,\r\nChloe, Diana, and all of their color.  Only let it tell\r\nthat all the ten had presents.  To Mr. Kuypers's\r\nsurprise, and to every one's surprise, indeed, there were\r\ncareful presents for him as for the rest, but it must be\r\nconfessed that Horace and Laura had spelled Chipah a\r\nlittle wildly.  The truth was that each separate person\r\nhad feared that he would feel a little left on one\r\nside,--he to whom so much was due on that day.  And each\r\nperson, severally, down to the Brick himself, had gone\r\nsecretly, without consulting the others, to select from\r\nhis own possessions something very dear, and had wrapped\r\nit up and marked it for the stranger.  When Mr. Kuypers\r\nopened a pretty paper, to find Matty's own illustrated\r\nBrowning, he was touched indeed.  When in a rough brown\r\npaper he found the Brick's jack-knife labelled \"FOR THE\r\nMAN,\" the tears stood in his eyes.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next day the \"Evening Lantern\" contained this\r\neditorial article:--\r\n\r\n\"The absurd fiasco regarding the accounts of Mr.\r\nMolyneux, which has occupied the correspondents of the\r\nperiodical press for some days, and has even been\r\nadverted to in New York journals claiming the title of\r\nmetropolitan, came to a fit end at the Capitol yesterday.\r\nThe wiseacre owls who started it did not see fit to put\r\nin an appearance before the committee.  Mr. Molyneux\r\nhimself sent to the Chairman a most interesting volume of\r\nmanuscript, which is, indeed, a valuable historical\r\nmemorial of times that tried men's souls.  The committee\r\nand other gentlemen present examined this curious record\r\nwith great interest.  Not to speak of the minor details,\r\nan autograph letter of the lamented Gen. Trebou gives\r\nfull credit to the Bureau of Internal Improvement for the\r\nskill with which they executed the commission given them\r\nin a department quite out of their line.  Our brethren of\r\nthe `Argus' will be pleased to know that every grain of\r\noats and every spear of straw paid for by, the now famous\r\n$47,000, are accounted for in detail.  The authenticated\r\nsignatures of the somewhat celebrated Camara and Gazza\r\nand the mythical Captain Cole appear.  Very valuable\r\nletters, throwing interesting light on our relations with\r\nthe Government of Mexico, from the pens of the lamented\r\nAdams and Prigg, show what were the services of those\r\nSpanish turncoats and their allies.\r\n\r\n\"We cannot say that we regret the attention which has\r\nthus been given to a very important piece of history, too\r\nlong neglected in the rush of more petty affairs.\r\nWe take the occasion, however, to enter our protest\r\nonce more against this preposterous system of\r\n`Resolutions,' in which, as it were in echo to every\r\nniaiserie of every hired pen in the country, the\r\nHouse degrades itself to the work of the common\r\nscavenger, orders at immense expense an investigation\r\ninto some subject where all well informed persons are\r\nfully advised, and at a cost of the national treasure,\r\netc., etc., etc. to the end of that chapter.'\"\r\n\r\nBut I fear no one at the Molyneux mansion had \"the\r\nlantern.\"  They had \"found a man,\" and did not need a\r\nlantern to look farther.\r\n\r\nIt was as Mr. Molyneux had said: he had cast his\r\nBread upon the Waters, and he had found it after many\r\ndays.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LOST PALACE\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LOST PALACE\r\n\r\n[From the Ingham Papers.]\r\n\r\n\"Passengers for Philadelphia and New York will change\r\ncars.\"\r\n\r\nThis annoying and astonishing cry was loudly made in\r\nthe palace-car \"City of Thebes,\" at Pittsburg, just as\r\nthe babies were well asleep, and all the passengers\r\nadapting themselves to a quiet evening.\r\n\r\n\"Impossible!\" said I, mildly, to the \"gentlemanly\r\nconductor,\" who beamed before me in the majesty of gilt\r\nlace on his cap, and the embroidered letters P. P. C.\r\nThese letters do not mean, as in French, \"to take leave,\"\r\nfor the peculiarity of this man is, that he does not\r\nleave you till your journey's end: they mean, in\r\nAmerican, \"Pullman's Palace Car.\"  \"Impossible!\" said I;\r\n\"I bought my ticket at Chicago through to Philadelphia,\r\nwith the assurance that the palace-car would go through.\r\nThis lady has done the same for herself and her children.\r\nNay, if you remember, you told me yourself that the `City\r\nof Thebes' was built for the Philadelphia service, and\r\nthat I need not move my hat, unless I wished, till we\r\nwere there.\"\r\n\r\nThe man did not blush, but answered, in the well-\r\nmannered tone of a subordinate used to obey,\r\n\r\nHere are my orders, sir; telegram just received here\r\nfrom headquarters:  `\"City of Thebes\" is to go to\r\nBaltimore.'  Another palace here, sir, waiting for you.\"\r\nAnd so we were trans-shipped into such chairs and berths\r\nas might have been left in this other palace, as not\r\nwanted by anybody in the great law of natural selection;\r\nand the \"City of Thebes\" went to Baltimore, I suppose.\r\nThe promises which had been made to us when we bought our\r\ntickets went to their place, and the people who made them\r\nwent to theirs.\r\n\r\nExcept for this little incident, of which all my\r\nreaders have probably experienced the like in these days\r\nof travel, the story I am now to tell would have seemed\r\nto me essentially improbable.  But so soon as I\r\nreflected, that, in truth, these palaces go hither, go\r\nthither, controlled or not, as it may be, by some distant\r\nbureau, the story recurred to me as having elements of\r\nvraisemblance which I had not noticed before.  Having\r\noccasion, nearly at the same time, to inquire at the\r\nMetropolitan station in Boston for a lost shawl which had\r\nbeen left in a certain Brookline car, the gentlemanly\r\nofficial told me that he did not know where that car was;\r\nhe had not heard of it for several days.  This again\r\nreminded me of \"The Lost Palace.\"  Why should not one\r\npalace, more or less, go astray, when there are thousands\r\nto care for?  Indeed had not Mr. Firth told me, at\r\nthe Albany, that the worst difficulty in the\r\nadministration of a strong railway is, that they cannot\r\ncall their freight-cars home?  They go astray on the line\r\nof some weaker sister, which finds it convenient to use\r\nthem till they begin to show a need for paint or repairs.\r\nIf freight-cars disappear, why not palaces?  So the story\r\nseems to me of more worth, and I put it upon paper.\r\n\r\nIt was on my second visit to Melbourne that I heard\r\nit.  It was late at night, in the coffee-room of the\r\nAuckland Arms, rather an indifferent third-class house,\r\nin a by-street in that city, to which, in truth, I should\r\nnot have gone had my finances been on a better scale than\r\nthey were.  I laid down, at last, an old New York\r\n\"Herald,\" which the captain of the \"Osprey\" had given me\r\nthat morning, and which, in the hope of home-news, I had\r\nread and read again to the last syllable of the\r\n\"Personals.\"  I put down the paper as one always puts\r\ndown an American paper in a foreign land, saying to\r\nmyself, \"Happy is that nation whose history is\r\nunwritten.\"  At that moment Sir Roger Tichborne, who had\r\nbeen talking with an intelligent-looking American on the\r\nother side of the table, stretched his giant form, and\r\nsaid he believed he would play a game of billiards before\r\nhe went to bed.  He left us alone; and the American\r\ncrossed the room, and addressed me.\r\n\r\n\"You are from Massachusetts, are you not?\" said he.\r\nI said I had lived in that State.\r\n\r\n\"Good State to come from,\" said he.  \"I was\r\nthere myself for three or four months,--four months\r\nand ten days precisely.  Did not like it very well; did\r\nnot like it.  At least I liked it well enough: my wife\r\ndid not like it; she could not get acquainted.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does she get acquainted here?\" said I, acting on a\r\nprinciple which I learned from Scipio Africanus at the\r\nLatin School, and so carrying the war into the enemy's\r\nregions promptly.  That is to say, I saw I must talk with\r\nthis man, and I preferred to have him talk of his own\r\nconcerns rather than of mine.\r\n\r\n\"O sir, I lost her,--I lost her ten years ago!  Lived\r\nin New Altoona then.  I married this woman the next\r\nautumn, in Vandalia.  Yes, Mrs. Joslyn is very well\r\nsatisfied here.  She sees a good deal of society, and\r\nenjoys very good health.\"\r\n\r\nI said that most people did who were fortunate enough\r\nto have it to enjoy.  But Mr. Joslyn did not understand\r\nthis bitter sarcasm, far less resent it.  He went on,\r\nwith sufficient volubility, to give to me his impressions\r\nof the colony,--of the advantages it would derive from\r\ndeclaring its independence, and then from annexing itself\r\nto the United States.  At the end of one of his periods,\r\ngoaded again to say something, I asked why he left his\r\nown country for a \"colony,\" if he so greatly preferred\r\nthe independent order of government.\r\n\r\nMr. Joslyn looked round somewhat carefully, shut the\r\ndoor of the room in which we were now alone,--and\r\nwere likely, at that hour of the night, to be alone,--and\r\nanswered my question at length, as the reader will see.\r\n\r\n\"Did you ever hear of the lost palace?\" said he a\r\nlittle anxiously.\r\n\r\nI said, no; that, with every year or two, I heard\r\nthat Mr. Layard had found a palace at Nineveh, but that\r\nI had never heard of one's being lost.\r\n\r\n\"They don't tell of it, sir.  Sometimes I think they\r\ndo not know themselves.  Does not that seem possible?\"\r\nAnd the poor man repeated this question with such\r\neagerness, that, in spite of my anger at being bored by\r\nhim, my heart really warmed toward him.  \"I really think\r\nthey do not know.  I have never seen one word in the\r\npapers about it.  Now, they would have put something in\r\nthe papers,--do you not think they would?  If they knew\r\nit themselves, they would.\"\r\n\r\n\"Knew what?\" said I, really startled out of my\r\ndetermination to snub him.\r\n\r\n\"Knew where the palace is,--knew how it was lost.\"\r\n\r\nBy this time, of course, I supposed he was crazy.\r\nBut a minute more dispelled that notion; and I beg the\r\nreader to relieve his mind from it.  This man knew\r\nperfectly well what he was talking about, and never, in\r\nthe whole narration, showed any symptom of mania,--a\r\nmatter on which I affect to speak with the intelligence\r\nof the \"experts\" indeed.\r\n\r\nAfter a little of this fencing with each other, in\r\nwhich he satisfied himself that my ignorance was not\r\naffected, he took a sudden resolution, as if it were a\r\nrelief to him to tell me the whole story.\r\n\r\n\"It was years on years ago,\" said he.  \"It was when\r\nthey first had palaces.\"\r\n\r\nStill thinking of Nimrod's palace and Priam's, I said\r\nthat must have been a great while ago.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, indeed,\" said he.  \"You would not call them\r\npalaces now, since you have seen Pullman's and Wagner's.\r\nBut we called them palaces then.  So many looking-\r\nglasses, you know, and tapestry carpets and gold spit-\r\nboxes.  Ours was the first line that run palaces.\"\r\n\r\nI asked myself, mentally, of what metal were the\r\nspit-boxes in Semiramis's palace; but I said nothing.\r\n\r\n\"Our line was the first line that had them.  We were\r\nrunning our lightning express on the `Great Alleghanian.'\r\nWe were in opposition to everybody, made close\r\nconnections, served supper on board, and our passengers\r\nonly were sure of the night-boat at St. Louis.  Those\r\nwere the days of river-boats, you know.  We introduced\r\nthe palace feature on the railroad; and very successful\r\nit was.  I was an engineer.  I had a first-rate\r\ncharacter, and the best wages of any man on the line.\r\nNever put me on a dirt-dragger or a lazy freight loafer,\r\nI tell you.  No, sir!  I ran the expresses, and nothing\r\nelse, and lay off two days in the week, besides.  I don't\r\nthink I should have thought of it but for Todhunter,\r\nwho was my palace conductor.\"\r\n\r\nAgain this IT, which bad appeared so mysteriously in\r\nwhat the man said before.  I asked no question, but\r\nlistened, really interested now, in the hope I should\r\nfind out what IT was; and this the reader will learn.  He\r\nwent on, in a hurried way:--\r\n\r\n\"Todhunter was my palace conductor.  One night he was\r\nfull, and his palace was hot, and smelled bad of whale-\r\noil.  We did not burn petroleum then.  Well, it was a\r\nsplendid full moon in August; and we were coming down\r\ngrade, making up the time we had lost at the Brentford\r\njunction.  Seventy miles an hour she ran if she ran one.\r\nTodhunter had brought his cigar out on the tender, and\r\nwas sitting by me.  Good Lord! it seems like last week.\r\n\r\n\"Todhunter says to me, `Joslyn,' says he, `what's the\r\nuse of crooking all round these valleys, when it would be\r\nso easy to go across?'  You see, we were just beginning\r\nto crook round, so as to make that long bend there is at\r\nChamoguin; but right across the valley we could see the\r\nstern lights of Fisher's train: it was not more than half\r\na mile away, but we should run eleven miles before we\r\ncame there.\"\r\n\r\nI knew what Mr. Joslyn meant.  To cross the mountain\r\nranges by rail, the engineers are obliged to wind up one\r\nside of a valley, and then, boldly crossing the head of\r\nthe ravine on a high arch, to wind up the other side\r\nstill, so that perhaps half an hour's journey is\r\nconsumed, while not a mile of real distance is made.\r\nJoslyn took out his pencil, and on the back of an\r\nenvelope drew a little sketch of the country; which, as\r\nit happened, I still preserve, and which, with his\r\ncomments, explains his whole story completely.  \"Here we\r\nare,\" said he.  \"This black line is the Great\r\nAlleghanian,--double track, seventy pounds to the yard;\r\nno figuring off there, I tell you.  This was a good\r\nstraight run, down grade a hundred and seventy-two feet\r\non the mile.  There, where I make this X, we came on the\r\nChamoguin Valley, and turned short, nearly north.\r\nSo we ran wriggling about till Drums here, where we\r\nstopped if they showed lanterns,--what we call a flag-\r\nstation.  But there we got across the valley, and worked\r\nsouth again to this other X, which was, as I say, not\r\nfive-eighths of a mile from this X above, though it had\r\ntaken us eleven miles to get there.\"\r\n\r\nHe had said it was not more than half a mile; but\r\nthis half-mile grew to five-eighths as he became more\r\naccurate and serious.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said he, now resuming the thread of his\r\nstory, \"it was Todhunter put it into my head.  He owns he\r\ndid.  Todhunter says, says he, `Joslyn, what's the use of\r\ncrooking round all these valleys, when it would be so\r\neasy to go across?'\r\n\r\n\"Well, sir, I saw it then, as clear as I see it now.\r\nWhen that trip was done, I had two days to myself,--one\r\nwas Sunday,--and Todhunter had the same; and he came\r\nround to my house.  His wife knew mine, and we liked\r\nthem.  Well, we fell talking about it; and I got down the\r\nCyclopaedia, and we found out there about the speed of\r\ncannon-balls, and the direction they had to give them.\r\nYou know this was only talk then; we never thought what\r\nwould come of it; but very curious it all was.\"\r\n\r\nAnd here Mr. Joslyn went into a long mathematical\r\ntalk, with which I will not harass the reader, perfectly\r\nsure, from other experiments which I have tried with\r\nother readers, that this reader would skip it all if\r\nit were written down.  Stated very briefly, it amounted\r\nto this:  In the old-fashioned experiments of those days,\r\na cannon-ball travelled four thousand and one hundred\r\nfeet in nine seconds.  Now, Joslyn was convinced, like\r\nevery other engineman I ever talked to, that on a steep\r\ndown-grade he could drive a train at the rate of a\r\nhundred miles an hour.  This is thirteen hundred and\r\nfourteen feet in nine seconds,--almost exactly one-third\r\nof the cannon-ball's velocity.  At those rates, if the\r\nvalley at Chamoguin were really but five-eighths of a\r\nmile wide, the cannon-ball would cross it in seven or\r\neight seconds, and the train in about twenty-three\r\nseconds.  Both Todhunter and Joslyn were good enough\r\nmechanics and machinists to know that the rate for\r\nthirty-three hundred feet, the width of the valley, was\r\nnot quite the same as that for four thousand feet; for\r\nwhich, in their book, they had the calculations and\r\nformulas; but they also knew that the difference was to\r\ntheir advantage, or the advantage of the bold experiment\r\nwhich had occurred to both of them when Todhunter had\r\nmade on the tender his very critical suggestion.\r\n\r\nThe reader has already conceived the idea of this\r\nexperiment.  These rash men were wondering already\r\nwhether it were not possible to leap an engine flying\r\nover the Chamoguin ravine, as Eclipse or Flying Childers\r\nmight have leaped the brook at the bottom of it.  Joslyn\r\nbelieved implicitly, as I found in talk with him,\r\nthe received statement of conversation, that Eclipse, at\r\na single bound, sprang forty feet.  \"If Eclipse, who\r\nweighed perhaps one thousand two hundred, would spring\r\nforty feet, could not my train, weighing two hundred\r\ntons, spring a hundred times as far?\" asked he\r\ntriumphantly.  At least, he said that he said this to\r\nTodhunter.  They went into more careful studies of\r\nprojectiles, to see if it could or could not.\r\n\r\nThe article on \"Gunnery\" gave them just one of those\r\nconvenient tables which are the blessing of wise men and\r\nlearned men, and which lead half-trained men to their\r\nruin.  They found that for their \"range,\" which was, as\r\nthey supposed, eleven hundred yards, the elevation of a\r\nforty-two pounder was one degree and a third; of a nine-\r\npounder, three degrees.  The elevation for a railway\r\ntrain, alas! no man had calculated.  But this had\r\noccurred to both of them from the beginning.  In\r\ndescending the grade, at the spot where, on his little\r\nmap, Joslyn made the more westerly X, they were more than\r\neleven hundred feet above the spot where he had made his\r\nsecond, or easterly X.  All this descent was to the\r\nadvantage of the experiment.  A gunner would have said\r\nthat the first X \"commanded\" the second X, and that a\r\nbattery there would inevitably silence a battery at the\r\npoint below.\r\n\r\n\"We need not figure on it,\" said Todhunter, as Mrs.\r\nJoslyn called them in to supper.  \"If we did, we\r\nshould make a mistake.  Give me your papers.  When I go\r\nup, Monday night, I'll give them to my brother Bill.  I\r\nshall pass him at Faber's Mills.  He has studied all\r\nthese things, of course; and he will like the fun of\r\nmaking it out for us.\"  So they sat down to Mrs. Joslyn's\r\nwaffles; and, but for Bill Todhunter, this story would\r\nnever have been told to me, nor would John Joslyn and\r\n\"this woman\" ever have gone to Australia.\r\n\r\nBut Bill Todhunter was one of those acute men of whom\r\nthe new civilization of this country is raising thousands\r\nwith every year; who, in the midst of hard hand-work, and\r\na daily duty which to collegians and to the ignorant men\r\namong their professors seems repulsive, carry on careful\r\nscientific study, read the best results of the latest\r\ninquiry, manage to bring together a first-rate library of\r\nreference, never spend a cent for liquor or tobacco,\r\nnever waste an hour at a circus or a ball, but make their\r\nwives happy by sitting all the evening, \"figuring,\" one\r\nside of the table, while the wife is hemming napkins on\r\nthe other.  All of a sudden, when such a man is wanted,\r\nhe steps out, and bridges the Gulf of Bothnia; and people\r\nwonder, who forget that for two centuries and a half the\r\nforesighted men and women of this country have been\r\nbuilding up, in the face of the Devil of Selfishness on\r\nthe one hand, and of the Pope of Rome on the other, a\r\nsystem of popular education, improving every hour.\r\n\r\nAt this moment Bill Todhunter was foreman of Repair\r\nSection No. II on the \"Great Alleghanian,\"--a position\r\nwhich needed a man of first-rate promptness, of great\r\nresource, of good education in engineering.  Such a man\r\nhad the \"Great Alleghanian\" found in him, by good luck;\r\nand they had promoted him to their hardest-worked and\r\nbest-paid section,--the section on which, as it happened,\r\nwas this Chamoguin run, and the long bend which I have\r\ndescribed, by which the road \"headed\" that stream.\r\n\r\nThe younger Todhunter did meet his brother at Faber's\r\nMills, where the repair-train had hauled out of the way\r\nof the express, and where the express took wood.  The\r\nbrothers always looked for each other on such occasions;\r\nand Bill promised to examine the paper which Joslyn had\r\ncarefully written out, and which his brother brought to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nI have never repeated in detail the mass of\r\ncalculations which Bill Todhunter made on the suggestion\r\nthus given to him.  If I had, I would not repeat them\r\nhere, for a reason which has been suggested already.  He\r\nbecame fascinated with the problem presented to him.\r\nStated in the language of the craft, it was this:\r\n\r\nGiven a moving body, with a velocity eight thousand\r\neight hundred feet in a minute, what should be its\r\nelevation that it may fall eleven hundred feet in the\r\ntransit of five-eighths of a mile?\"  He had not only\r\nto work up the parabola, comparatively simple, but he had\r\nto allow for the resistance of the air, on the\r\nsupposition of a calm, according to the really admirable\r\nformulas of Robins and Coulomb, which were the best be\r\nhad access to.  Joslyn brought me, one day, a letter from\r\nBill Todhunter, which shows how carefully he went into\r\nthis intricate inquiry.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for them all, it took possession of\r\nthis spirited and accomplished young man.  You see, he\r\nnot only had the mathematical ability for the calculation\r\nof the fatal curve, but, as had been ordered without any\r\neffort of his, he was in precisely the situation of the\r\nwhole world for trying in practice his own great\r\nexperiment.  At each of the two X X of Joslyn's map, the\r\ncompany had, as it happened, switches for repair-trains\r\nor wood-trains.  Had it not, Bill Todhunter had ample\r\npower to make them.\r\n\r\nFor the \"experiment,\" all that was necessary was,\r\nthat under the pretext of re-adjusting these switches, he\r\nshould lay out that at the upper X so that it should run,\r\non the exact grade which he required, to the western edge\r\nof the ravine, in a line which should be the direct\r\ncontinuation of the long, straight run with which the\r\nlittle map begins.\r\n\r\nAn engine, then, running down that grade at the\r\nimmense rapidity practicable there, would take the switch\r\nwith its full speed, would fly the ravine at precisely\r\nthe proper slopes, and, if the switch had been\r\nrightly aligned, would land on the similar switch at the\r\nlower X.  It would come down exactly right on the track,\r\nas you sit precisely on a chair when you know exactly how\r\nhigh it is.\r\n\r\n\"If.\"  And why should it not be rightly aligned, if\r\nBill Todhunter himself aligned it?  This he was well\r\ndisposed to do.  He also would align the lower switch,\r\nthat at the lower X, that it might receive into its\r\nwilling embrace the engine on its arrival.\r\n\r\nWhen the bold engineer had conceived this plan, it\r\nwas he who pushed the others on to it, not they who urged\r\nhim.  They were at work on their daily duty, sometimes\r\ndid not meet each other for a day or two.  Bill Todhunter\r\ndid not see them more than once in a fortnight.  But\r\nwhenever they did meet, the thing seemed to be taken more\r\nand more for granted.  At last Joslyn observed one day,\r\nas he ran down, that there was a large working-party at\r\nthe switch above Drums, and he could see Bill Todhunter,\r\nin his broad sombrero, directing them all.  Joslyn was\r\nnot surprised, somehow, when he came to the lower switch,\r\nto find another working-party there.  The next time they\r\nall three met, Bill Todhunter told them that all was\r\nready if they were.  He said that he had left a few\r\nbirches to screen the line of the upper switch, for fear\r\nsome nervous bungler, driving an engine down, might be\r\nfrightened, and \"blow\" about the switch.  But he said\r\nthat any night when the others were ready to make\r\nthe fly, he was; that there would be a full moon the next\r\nWednesday, and, if there was no wind, he hoped they would\r\ndo it then.\r\n\r\n\"You know,\" said poor Joslyn, describing it to me, \"I\r\nshould never have done it alone; August would never have\r\ndone it alone; no, I do not think that Bill Todhunter\r\nhimself would have done it alone.  But our heads were\r\nfull of it.  We had thought of it and thought of it till\r\nwe did not think of much else; and here was everything\r\nready, and neither of us was afraid, and neither of us\r\nchose to have the others think he was afraid.  I did say,\r\nwhat was the truth, that I had never meant to try it with\r\na train.  I had only thought that we should apply to the\r\nsupe, and that he would get up a little excursion party\r\nof gentlemen,--editors, you know, and stockholders,--who\r\nwould like to do it together, and that I should have the\r\npleasure and honor of taking them over.  But Todhunter\r\npoohed at that.  He said all the calculations were made\r\nfor the inertia of a full train, that that was what the\r\nswitch was graded for, and that everything would have to\r\nbe altered if any part of the plan were altered.\r\nBesides, he said the superintendent would never agree,\r\nthat he would insist on consulting the board and the\r\nchief engineer, and that they would fiddle over it till\r\nChristmas.\r\n\r\n\"`No,' said Bill, `next Wednesday, or never!  If you\r\nwill not do it then, I will put the tracks back\r\nagain.'  August Todhunter said nothing; but I knew he\r\nwould do what we agreed to, and he did.\r\n\r\n\"So at last I said I would jump it on Wednesday\r\nnight, if the night was fine.  But I had just as lief own\r\nto you that I hoped it would not be fine.  Todhunter--\r\nBill Todhunter, I mean--was to leave the switch open\r\nafter the freight had passed, and to drive up to the\r\nWidow Jones's Cross Road.  There he would have a lantern,\r\nand I would stop and take him up.  He had a right to stop\r\nus, as chief of repairs.  Then we should have seven miles\r\ndown-grade to get up our speed, and then--we should see!\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Ingham, I might have spared myself the hoping\r\nfor foul weather.  It was the finest moonlight night that\r\nyou ever knew in October.  And if Bill Todhunter had\r\nweighed that train himself, he could not have been better\r\npleased,--one baggage-car, one smoking-car, two regular\r\nfirst-class, and two palaces: she run just as steady as\r\nan old cow!  We came to the Widow Jones's, square on\r\ntime; and there was Bill's lantern waving.  I slowed the\r\ntrain: he jumped on the tender without stopping it.  I\r\n`up brakes' again, and then I told Flanagan, my fireman,\r\nto go back to the baggage-car, and see if they would lend\r\nme some tobacco.  You see, we wanted to talk, and we\r\ndidn't want him to see.  `Mr. Todhunter and I will feed\r\nher till you come back,' says I to Flanagan.  In a\r\nminute after he had gone, August Todhunter came forward\r\non the engine; and, I tell you, she did fly!\r\n\r\n\"`Not too fast,' said Bill, `not too fast: too fast\r\nis as bad as too slow.'\r\n\r\n\"`Never you fear me,' says I.  `I guess I know this\r\nroad and this engine.  Take out your watch, and time the\r\nmile-posts,' says I; and he timed them.  `Thirty-eight\r\nseconds,' says he; `thirty-seven and a half, thirty-six,\r\nthirty-six, thirty-six,'--three times thirty-six, as we\r\npassed the posts, just as regular as an old clock!  And\r\nthen we came right on the mile-post you know at Old\r\nFlander's.  `Thirty-six,' says Bill again.  And then she\r\ntook the switch,--I can hear that switch-rod ring under\r\nus now Mr. Ingham,--and then--we were clear!\r\n\r\n\"Wasn't it grand?  The range was a little bit up,\r\nyou see, at first; but it seemed as if we were flying\r\njust straight across.  All the rattle of the rail\r\nstopped, you know, though the pistons worked just as true\r\nas ever; neither of us said one word, you know; and she\r\njust flew--well, as you see a hawk fly sometimes, when he\r\npounces, you know, only she flew so straight and true!\r\nI think you may have dreamed of such things.  I have; and\r\nnow,--now I dream it very often.  It was not half a\r\nminute, you know, but it seemed a good long time.  I said\r\nnothing and they said nothing; only Bill just squeezed my\r\nhand.  And just as I knew we must be half over,--for I\r\ncould see by the star I was watching ahead that we\r\nwere not going up, but were falling again,--do you think\r\nthe rope by my side tightened quick, and the old bell on\r\nthe engine gave one savage bang, turned right over as far\r\nas the catch would let it, and stuck where it turned!\r\nJust that one sound, everything else was still; and then\r\nshe landed on the rails, perhaps seventy feet inside the\r\nravine, took the rails as true and sweet as you ever saw\r\na ship take the water, hardly touched them, you know,\r\nskimmed--well, as I have seen a swallow skim on the sea;\r\nthe prettiest, well, the tenderest touch, Mr. Ingham,\r\nthat ever I did see!  And I could just hear the\r\nconnecting rods tighten the least bit in the world behind\r\nme, and we went right on.\r\n\r\n\"We just looked at each other in the faces, and we\r\ncould not speak; no, I do not believe we spoke for three\r\nquarters of a minute.  Then August said, `Was not that\r\ngrand?  Will they let us do it always, Bill?'  But we\r\ncould not talk then.  Flanagan came back with the\r\ntobacco, and I had just the wit to ask him why he had\r\nbeen gone so long.  Poor fellow! he was frightened enough\r\nwhen we pulled up at Clayville, and he thought it was\r\nDrums.  Drums, you see, was way up the bend, a dozen\r\nmiles above Clayville.  Poor Flanagan thought we must\r\nhave passed there while he was skylarking in the baggage-\r\ncar, and that he had not minded it.  We never stopped at\r\nDrums unless we had passengers, or they.  It was what\r\nwe call a flag-station.  So I blew Flanagan up, and\r\ntold him he was gone too long.\r\n\r\n\"Well, sir, at Clayville we did stop,--always stopped\r\nthere for wood.  August Todhunter, he was the palace\r\nconductor; he went back to look to his passengers.  Bill\r\nstayed with me.  But in a minute August came running\r\nback, and called me off the engine.  He led me forward,\r\nwhere it was dark; but I could see, as we went, that\r\nsomething was to pay.  The minute we were alone he\r\nsays,--\r\n\r\n\"`John, we've lost the rear palace.'\r\n\r\n\"`Don't fool me, August,' says I.\r\n\r\n\"`No fooling, John,' says he.  `The shackle parted.\r\nThe cord parted, and is flying loose behind now.  If you\r\nwant to see, come and count the cars.  The \"General\r\nFremont\" is here all right; but I tell you the \"James\r\nBuchanan\" is at the bottom of the Chamoguin Creek.'\r\n\r\n\"I walked back to the other end of the platform, as\r\nfast as I could go and not be minded.  Todhunter was\r\nthere before me, tying up the loose end of the bell-cord.\r\nThere was a bit of the broken end of the shackle twisted\r\nin with the bolt.  I pulled the bolt and threw the iron\r\ninto the swamp far as I could fling her.  Then I nodded\r\nto Todhunter and walked forward just as that old goose at\r\nClayville had got his trousers on, so he could come out,\r\nand ask me if we were not ahead of time.  I tell you,\r\nsir, I did not stop to talk with him.  I just rang `All\r\naboard!' and started her again; and this time I run\r\nslow enough to save the time before we came down to\r\nSteuben.  We were on time, all right, there.\"\r\n\r\nHere poor Joslyn stopped a while in his story; and I\r\ncould see that he was so wrought up with excitement that\r\nI had better not interrupt, either with questions or with\r\nsympathy.  He rallied in a minute or two, and said,--\r\n\r\n\"I thought--we all thought--that there would be a\r\ndespatch somewhere waiting us.  But no; all was as\r\nregular as the clock.  One palace more or less,--what did\r\nthey know, and what did they care?  So daylight came.  We\r\ncould not say a word, you know, with Flanagan there; and\r\nwe only stopped, you know, a minute or two every hour;\r\nand just then was when August Todhunter had to be with\r\nhis passengers, you know.  Was not I glad when we came\r\ninto Pemaquid,--our road ran from Pemaquid across the\r\nmountains to Eden, you know,--when we came into Pemaquid,\r\nand nobody had asked any questions?\r\n\r\n\"I reported my time at the office of the master of\r\ntrains, and I went home.  I tell you, Mr. Ingham, I have\r\nnever seen Pemaquid Station since that day.\r\n\r\n\"I had done nothing wrong, of course.  I had obeyed\r\nevery order, and minded every signal.  But still I knew\r\npublic opinion might be against me when they heard of the\r\nloss of the palace.  I did not feel very well about it,\r\nand I wrote a note to say I was not well enough to take\r\nmy train the next night; and I and Mrs. Joslyn went\r\nto New York, and I went aboard a Collins steamer as\r\nfireman; and Mrs. Joslyn, she went as stewardess; and I\r\nwrote to Pemaquid, and gave up my place.  It was a good\r\nplace, too; but I gave it up, and I left America.\r\n\r\nBill Todhunter, he resigned his place too, that same\r\nday, though that was a good place.  He is in the Russian\r\nservice now.  He is running their line from Archangel to\r\nAstrachan; good pay, he says, but lonely.  August would\r\nnot stay in America after his brother left; and he is now\r\ncaptain's clerk on the Harkaway steamers between Bangkok\r\nand Cochbang; good place he says, but hot.  So we are all\r\nparted.\r\n\r\n\"And do you know, sir, never one of us ever heard of\r\nthe lost palace!\"\r\n\r\nSure enough, under that very curious system of\r\nresponsibility, by which one corporation owns the\r\ncarriages which another corporation uses, nobody in the\r\nworld has to this moment ever missed \"The Lost Palace.\"\r\nOn each connecting line, everybody knew that \"she\" was\r\nnot there; but no one knew or asked where she was.  The\r\ndescent into the rocky bottom of the Chamouin, more than\r\nfifteen hundred feet below the line of flight, had of\r\ncourse been  rapid,--slow at first, but in the end rapid.\r\nIn the first second, the lost palace had fallen sixteen\r\nfeet; in the second, sixty-four; in the third, one\r\nhundred and forty-four; in the fourth, two hundred and\r\nfifty-six; in the fifth, four hundred feet; so that\r\nit must have been near the end of the sixth second of its\r\nfall, that, with a velocity now of more than six hundred\r\nfeet in a second, the falling palace, with its\r\nunconscious passengers, fell upon the rocks at the bottom\r\nof the Chamoguin ravine.  In the dead of night, wholly\r\nwithout jar or parting, those passengers must have been\r\nsleeping soundly; and it is impossible, therefore, on any\r\ncalculation of human probability, that any one of them\r\ncan have been waked an instant before the complete\r\ndestruction of the palace, by the sudden shock of its\r\nfall upon the bed of the stream.  To them the accident,\r\nif it is fair to call it so, must have been wholly free\r\nfrom pain.\r\n\r\nThe tangles of that ravine, and the swamp below it,\r\nare such that I suppose that even the most adventurous\r\nhuntsman never finds his way there.  On the only occasion\r\nwhen I ever met Mr. Jules Verne he expressed a desire to\r\ndescend there from one of his balloons, to learn whether\r\nthe inhabitants of \"The Lost Palace\" might not still\r\nsurvive, and be living in a happy republican colony\r\nthere,--a place without railroads, without telegrams,\r\nwithout mails, and certainly without palaces.  But at the\r\nmoment when these sheets go to press, no account of such\r\nan adventure has appeared from his rapid pen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n99 LINWOOD STREET\r\n\r\nA CHRISTMAS STORY\r\n\r\nA gray morning, the deck wet, the iron all beaded with\r\nfrost, all the longshoremen in heavy pea-jackets or\r\ncardigans, the whole ship in a bustle, and the favored\r\nfirst-class passengers just leaving.\r\n\r\nOne sad-looking Irish girl stands with her knit hood\r\nalready spotted with the rime, and you cannot tell\r\nwhether those are tears which hang from her black\r\neyelashes or whether the fog is beginning to freeze\r\nthere.  What you see is that the poor thing looks right\r\nand left and up the pier and down the pier, and that in\r\nthe whole crowd--they all seem so selfish--she sees\r\nnobody.  Hundreds of people going and coming, pushing and\r\nhauling, and Nora's big brother is not there, as he\r\npromised to be and should be.\r\n\r\nMrs. Ohstrom, the motherly Swedish woman, who has\r\nfour children and ten tin cups and a great bed and five\r\ntrunks and a fatuous, feckless husband makes time,\r\nbetween cousins and uncles and custom-house men and\r\nsharpers, to run up every now and then to say that Nora\r\nmust not cry, that she must be easy, that she has spoken\r\nto the master and the master has said they are three\r\nhours earlier than they were expected.  And all this\r\nwas so kindly meant and so kindly said that poor Nora\r\nbrushed the tears away, if they were tears, and thanked\r\nher, though she did not understand one word that dear\r\nMrs. Ohstrom said to her.  What is language, or what are\r\nwords, after all?\r\n\r\nAnd the bright-buttoned, daintily dressed little\r\nship's doctor, whom poor Nora hardly knew in his shore\r\nfinery,--he made time to stop and tell her that the ship\r\nwas too early, and that she must not worry.  Father, was\r\nit, she was waiting for?  \"Oh, brother!  Oh, he will be\r\nsure to be here!  Better sit down.  Here is a chair.\r\nDon't cry.  I am afraid you had no breakfast.  Take this\r\norange.  It will cheer you up.  I shall see you again.\"\r\n\r\nAlas! the little doctor was swept away and forgot\r\nNora for a week, and she \"was left lamenting.\"\r\n\r\nFor one hour went by, and two, and three.  The\r\nSwedish woman went, and the doctor went, and the girl\r\ncould see the captain go, and the mate that gave them\r\ntheir orders every morning.  The custom-house people\r\nbegan to go.  The cabs and other carriages for the gentry\r\nhad gone long before.\r\n\r\nAnd poor Nora was left lamenting.\r\n\r\nThen was it that that queer Salvation Army girl, with\r\na coal-scuttle for a bonnet, came up again.  She had\r\nsmiled pleasantly two or three times before, and had\r\nasked Nora to eat a bun.  Poor Nora broke down and\r\ncried heartily this time.  But the other was patient and\r\nkind, and said just what the others had said.  Only she\r\ndid not go away.  And she had the sense to ask if Nora\r\nknew where the brother lived.\r\n\r\n\"Why, of course I do, miss.  See, here is the\r\npaper.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the little soldier lass read it:  \"99 Linwood\r\nStreet, Boston.\"\r\n\r\n\"My poor child, what a pity you did not let us see it\r\nbefore!\"\r\n\r\nAlas and alas!  Nora's box was of the biggest.  But\r\nthe army lass flinched at nothing.\r\n\r\nAn immense wagon, with two giant horses, loaded with\r\nthe most extraordinary chests which have been seen since\r\nthe days of the Vikings.  Piled on the top were many\r\nfeather-beds, and on the top of the feather-beds a\r\nScandinavian matron.  With Mike, the good-natured\r\nteamster, who was at once captain and pilot of this\r\ncraft, the army lass had easily made her treaty, when he\r\nwas told the story.  He was to carry Nora and her outfit\r\nto the Linwood Street house after he had taken these\r\nSwedes to theirs.  \"And indade it will not be farr, miss.\r\nThere 's a shorrt cut behind Egan's, if indade he did not\r\nput up a tinimint house since I was that way.\"  And with\r\nnew explanations to Nora that all was right, that indeed\r\nit was better this way than it would have been had her\r\nbrother been called from his work, she was lifted,\r\nwithout much consent of her own, to the driver's seat,\r\nand her precious \"box\" was so placed that she could\r\nrest her little feet upon it.\r\n\r\nNora had proudly confided to the friendly lass the\r\nassurance that she had money, had even shown a crisp $2\r\nbill which had been sent to her for exigencies.\r\n\r\nBut when the lass made the contract with Mike\r\nDermott, the good fellow said he should take Nora and her\r\nbox for the love of County Cork.  \"Indade, indade, I\r\ndon't take money from the like of her.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so they started, with the Swedish men walking on\r\none side of the cart with their rifles, keeping a good\r\nlookout for buffaloes and red Indians and grizzly bears,\r\nas men landing in a new country which they were to\r\ncivilize.  More sailing for there was the ferry to cross\r\nto old Boston.  Much waiting, for there was a broken-down\r\ncoal-wagon in Salutation Alley.  Long conference between\r\nNora and Mike, in which  he did all the talking and she\r\nall the listening, as to home rule and Mr. McCarthy, and\r\nwhat O'Brien thought of this, and what Cunniff thought of\r\nthat.  Then an occasional question came in Swedish from\r\nthe matron above their heads, and was followed by a reply\r\nin Celtic English from Mike, each wholly ignorant of the\r\nviews or wishes of the others.  And occasionally the\r\nescort of riflemen, after some particular attack of\r\nchaff, in words which they fortunately did not\r\nunderstand, looked up to their matron, controller, and\r\ndirector, exchanged words with her, and then studied\r\nthe pavement again for tracks of buffalo.  A long hour of\r\nall this, the stone and brick of the city giving way to\r\ngreen trees between the houses as they come to\r\nDorchester.\r\n\r\nPoor Nora looks right and looks left, hoping to meet\r\nher big brother.  She begins to think she shall remember\r\nhim.  Everybody else looks so different from Fermoy that\r\nhe must look like home.\r\n\r\nBut there is no brother.\r\n\r\nThere is at last a joyful cry as the Swedish matron\r\nand the riflemen recognize familiar faces.  And Mike\r\nsmiles gladly, and brings round the stout bays with a\r\ntwitch, so that the end of the cart comes square to the\r\nsidewalk.  Somebody produces a step-ladder, and the\r\nSwedish matron, with her bird-cage in her hand, descends\r\nin triumph.  Much kissing, much shaking of hands, much\r\nthanking of God, more or less reverent.  Then the cords\r\nare cut, beds flung down, the giant boxes lifted, the\r\nsons of Anak only know how.  The money covenanted for is\r\nproduced and paid, and Mike mounts lightly to Nora's\r\nside.\r\n\r\n\"And now, Nora, my child, wherr is the paper?  For in\r\ntwo minutes we 'll soon be therr, now that this rubbish\r\nis landed.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he read on the precious paper, \"John McLaughlin,\r\n99 Linwood Street.\"\r\n\r\nStrange to say, the paper said just what it had said\r\ntwo hours before.\r\n\r\n\"And now, my dear child, we will be therr in ten\r\nminutes, if only we can cross back of Egan's.\"\r\n\r\nAnd although they could not cross back of Egan's, for\r\nEgan had put up a \"tinimint\" house since Mike had passed\r\nthat way, yet in ten minutes Linwood Street had been\r\nfound.  No. 99 at last revealed itself, between Nos. 7\r\nand 2,--a great six-story wooden tinder-box, with\r\nclothes-lines mysterious behind, open doors in front,\r\nlong passages running through, three doors on each side\r\nof a passage, and the wondering heads of eleven women who\r\nbelonged to five different races and spoke in six\r\ndifferent languages appearing from their eleven windows,\r\nas Mike and Nora and the two bays all stopped at one and\r\nthe same moment at the door.\r\n\r\nMike was already anxious about his time, for he was\r\nto be at the custom-house an hour away or more at eleven\r\nsharp.  But he selected a certain Widow Flynn from the\r\neleven white-capped women; he explained to her briefly\r\nthat John McLaughlin was to be found; he told Nora for\r\nthe thirty-seventh time that all was right and that she\r\nmust not cry; he looked at his watch again, rather\r\nanxiously, mounted his box, and drove swiftly away.\r\n\r\nHe was the one thread which bound Nora to this world.\r\nAnd this thread broke before her eyes.\r\n\r\nMrs. Flynn affected to be cheerful.  But she was not\r\ncheerful.  Mrs. Flynn was a prominent person in her\r\nsodality.  And well she knew that if any John\r\nMcLaughlin in those parts were expecting any sister from\r\nhome, she should know him and where he lived.  Well she\r\nknew, also, that John McLaughlin, the mason, was born in\r\nGlasgow; that John McLaughlin, who is on the city work,\r\nhad all his family around him, and, most distinct of all,\r\nshe knew that no McLaughlin, sisterless or many-sistered,\r\nlived in this beehive which she lived in, though it were\r\n99 Linwood Street.  Into her own cell of that beehive,\r\nhowever, she took poor, sad, desolate Nora.  Into the\r\nhallway she bade the loafing neighbor boys bring Nora's\r\ntrunk; in a language Nora could hardly understand she\r\nexplained to her that all would be well as soon as the\r\npoliceman passed by.  She sent Mary Murphy, who happened\r\nto be at home from school, for a pint of milk, and so\r\ncompelled Nora to drink a cup of tea and to eat a biscuit\r\nand a dropped egg, while they waited for the policeman.\r\n\r\nOf course he knew of seven John McLaughlins.  He even\r\nwent to the drug-store and looked in the Boston Directory\r\nto find that there were there the names of sixty-one\r\nmore.  But not one of them lived in Linwood Street, as\r\nthey all knew already.  All the same Nora was charged not\r\nto cry, to drink more tea and eat more bread and butter.\r\nThe \"cop\" said he would look in on three of the Johns\r\nwhom he knew, and intelligent boys now returning from\r\nschool were sent to the homes of the other four to\r\ninterrogate them as to any expected sister.  Within an\r\nhour, now nearly one o'clock, answers were received\r\nfrom all the seven.  No one of them expected chick or\r\nchild from Fermoy.\r\n\r\nBut the \"cop\" had a suggestion to make.  His pocket\r\nlist of names of streets revealed another Linwood\r\nStreet--in Roxbury; not this one in Dorchester.  Be it\r\nknown to unlearned readers, who in snug shelter in\r\nMontana follow along this little tale, that Roxbury and\r\nDorchester are both parts of that large municipality\r\ncalled Boston.  Though no John McLaughlin was in the\r\ndirectory for 99 Linwood Street, Roxbury, was not that\r\nthe objective?  Poor Nora was questioned as to Roxbury.\r\nShe was sure she never heard of it.\r\n\r\nBut the clue was too good to be lost, and the\r\nauthority of the friendly \"cop\" was too great to be\r\nresisted.  He telephoned to the central office that Nora\r\nMcLaughlin, just from Ireland, had been found, in a\r\nfashion, but that no one knew where to put her.  Then he\r\nstopped a milkman from Braintree, who delivered afternoon\r\nmilk for invalids.\r\n\r\nWas he not going through Roxbury?\r\n\r\nOf course he was.\r\n\r\nWould he not take this lost child to 99 Linwood Street?\r\n\r\nOf course he would.  Milkmen, from their profession,\r\nhave hearts warm toward children.\r\n\r\nWell, if he were to take her, he had better take her\r\ntrunk too.\r\n\r\nTo which illogical proposal the milkman\r\nacceded--on the afternoon route there is so much\r\nless milk to take than there is in the morning.\r\n\r\nSo Nora was lifted into the milk-wagon.  In tears she\r\nkissed good Mrs. Flynn.  The boys and girls assembled to\r\nbid her good-by, and even she had a hope for a few\r\nmoments that her troubles were at an end.\r\n\r\nAt 99 Linwood Street, Roxbury, they were preparing\r\nfor the Review Club.\r\n\r\nThe Review Club met once a fortnight at half-past two\r\no'clock at the house of one or another of the members.\r\nThey first arranged the little details of the business.\r\nThen the hostess read, or made some one read, the scraps\r\nwhich seemed most worthy in the reviews and magazines of\r\nthe last issues, and at four the husbands and brothers\r\nand neighbors generally dropped in, and there was\r\nafternoon tea.\r\n\r\n\"You are sure you have cream enough, Ellen?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, mum.\"\r\n\r\n\"All kinds of tea, you know, that which the Chinese\r\ngentlemen sent, and be sure of the chocolate for Mrs.\r\nBunce.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed yes, mum.\"\r\n\r\n\"And let me know just before you bring up the hot\r\nwater.\"  Doorbell rings.  \"There is Mrs. Walter now!\"\r\n\r\nNo, it wasn't Mrs. Walter.  She came three minutes\r\nafter.  But before she came, Howells, the milkman, had\r\nlifted Nora from her seat.  As the snow fell fast on the\r\ndoorsteps, he carried her carefully up to the door,\r\nand even by the time Ellen answered the bell he had the\r\nheavy chest, dragging it over the snow by the stout rope\r\nat one end.\r\n\r\nEllen was amazed to find this group instead of Mrs.\r\nWalter.  She called her mistress, who heard Howells's\r\nrealistic story with amazement, not to say amusement.\r\n\r\n\"You poor dear child!\" she cried at once.  \"Come in\r\nwhere it is dry!  John McLaughlin?  No, indeed!  Who can\r\nJohn McLaughlin be?  Ellen, what is Mike's last name?\"\r\n\r\nMike was the choreman, who made the furnace fire and\r\nkept the sidewalk.\r\n\r\n\"Mike's name, mum? I don't know, mum.  Mary will\r\nknow, mum.\"\r\n\r\nAnd for the moment Ellen disappeared to find Mary.\r\n\r\n\"Never mind, never mind.  Come in, you poor child.\r\nYou are very good to bring her, Mr. Howells, very good\r\nindeed.  We will take care of her.  Is it going to\r\nstorm?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Howells thought it was going to storm, and turned\r\nto go away.  At that moment Mrs. Walter arrived, the\r\nfirst comer of the Review Club.  And Nora's new hostess\r\nhad to turn to her guests, while Ellen in the last cares\r\nfor the afternoon table had to comfort Nora by spasms.\r\nIt was left for Margaret the chambermaid to pump out--or\r\nto screw out, as you choose--the details of the story\r\nfrom the poor frightened waif, who seemed more astray\r\nthan ever.\r\n\r\nJohn McLaughlin?  No.  Nobody knew anything about\r\nhim.  The last choreman was named McManus, but he went to\r\nOttawa three years ago!\r\n\r\nAnd while the different facts and doubts were\r\ncanvassed in the kitchen, upstairs they settled the\r\nBulgarian question, the origin of the natives of\r\nTasmania, and the last questions about realism.\r\n\r\nOnly the mind of the lady of the house returned again\r\nand again to questions as to the present residence of\r\nJohn McLaughlin.\r\n\r\nFor in spite of the gathering snow and the prospect\r\nof more, the members of the Review Club had followed fast\r\non Mrs. Walters and gathered in full force.\r\n\r\nThe hostess, though somewhat preoccupied, was\r\ncourteous and ready.\r\n\r\nOnly the functions of the club, as they went forward,\r\nwould be occasionally interrupted.  Thus she would read\r\naloud \"as in her private duty bound\"--\r\n\r\n\"`The peasantry were excited, but were held in check\r\nby promises from Stambuloff.  The emissaries of the\r\nCzar--'\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Goodspeed, would you mind reading on?  Here is\r\nthe place.  I see my postman pass the window.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so, moving quickly to the front door, she\r\ninterviewed the faithful Harrington, dressed, heaven\r\nknows why, in Confederate uniform of gray.  For\r\nHarrington had served his four years on the loyal side.\r\nFour times a day did Harrington with his letter-bag\r\nrenew the connection of this household with the world and\r\nother worlds.\r\n\r\n\"Dear Mr. Harrington, I thought you could tell us.\r\nHere is a girl named Nora McLaughlin, and here is her\r\ntrunk, both left at the door by the milkman, and we do\r\nnot know anything about where she belongs.\"\r\n\r\n\"Insufficient address?\" asked Harrington,\r\nprofessionally.\r\n\r\n\"Exactly.  All she knows is that her brother is named\r\nJohn.\"\r\n\r\n\"A great many of them are,\" said Harrington, already\r\nwriting on his memorandum book, and in his memory fixing\r\nthe fact that a large, two-legged living parcel,\r\ninsufficiently addressed, had been left at the wrong door\r\nfor John McLaughlin; also a trunk, too large for delivery\r\nby the penny post.\r\n\r\n\"I will tell the other men, and if I was you I would\r\nsend to the police.\"\r\n\r\n\"Would you mind telling the first officer you meet?\r\nI hate to send my girls out.\"  And so she returned to\r\nBulgaria.\r\n\r\nBut Bulgaria was ended, and Mrs. Conover handed her\r\nan article on \"Antarctic Discovery.\"  She was again\r\nreading:--\r\n\r\n\"Under these circumstances Captain Wilkes, who had\r\ncollected a boatload of stones from the front of the\r\nglacier,\" when she gave back the \"Forum\" to Mrs. Conover.\r\n\"Would you mind going on just a minute? \" she said, and\r\nran out to meet the icecream man.  So soon as he had\r\nleft his tins she said,--\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Fridge, would you mind stopping at the Dudley\r\nSchool as you go home and telling Miss Lougee that there\r\nis a lost girl here?\" etc.\r\n\r\nGood Mr. Fridge was most eager to help, and the\r\nhostess returned, took the book again and read on with\r\n\"the temperature, as they observed it, was 99 degrees C.;\r\nbut, as the alcohol in their tins was frozen at the\r\nmoment, there seemed reason to suspect the correctness of\r\nthis observation.\"\r\n\r\nAnd a shiver passed over the Review Club.\r\n\r\nThus far the powers of confusion and error seemed to\r\nhave been triumphant over poor Nora, or such was the\r\nsuccess of that power who uses these agencies, if the\r\nreader prefer to personify him.\r\n\r\nBut the time had come to turn his left flank and to\r\nattack his forces in the rear, for the postman now took\r\nthe field,--that is to say, Harrington, good fellow,\r\nfinished his third delivery, four good miles and nine-\r\ntenths of a furlong, snow two inches deep, three, four,\r\nsix, before he was done, and then returned to his branch\r\noffice to report.\r\n\r\n\"Two-legged parcel; insufficient address; 99 Linwood\r\nStreet!  Jim, what ever come to that letter that went to\r\n99 Linwood Street with insufficient address six weeks\r\nago?\"\r\n\r\n\"Linwood Street?  Insufficient address?  Foreign\r\nletter?  Why, of course, you know, went back to the\r\ncentral office.\"\r\n\r\n\"I guess it did,\" said Harrington, grimly; \"so I must\r\ngo there too.\"\r\n\r\nThis meant that after Harrington had gone his rounds\r\nagain on delivery route No. 6, four more miles and nine-\r\ntenths more of a furlong, 313 doorbells and only 73 slit\r\nboxes, snow now ranging from 6 inches to 12 on the\r\nsidewalks, and breast-deep where there was a chance for\r\ndrifting, when all this was well done, so that Harrington\r\nhad no more duties to Uncle Sam, he could take Nora\r\nMcLaughlin's work in hand, and thus defeat the prince of\r\nevil.\r\n\r\nTo the central office by a horse-car.  Blocked once\r\nor twice, but well at the office at 7.30 in the evening.\r\n\r\nChristmas work heavy, so the whole home staff is on\r\nduty.  That is well.  Enemy of souls loses one point\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nBlind-letter clerks all here.  Insufficient-delivery\r\nmen both here.  Chief of returned bureau here.  All\r\nsummoned to the foreign office as Harrington tells his\r\nstory.  Indexes produced, ledgers, journals, day-books,\r\nand private passbooks.  John McLaughlin's biography\r\nfollowed out on 67 of the different avatars in which his\r\npersonality has been manifested under that name.  False\r\ntrail here--clue breaks there--scent fails here, but at\r\nlast--a joyful cry from Will Search:--\r\n\r\n\"Here you are!  Insufficient address.  November 1.\r\nQueenstown letter--`Linwood, to John McLaughlin.  Try\r\nDorchester.  Try Roxbury.  Try East Boston.  Try\r\nSomerville'-- and there it stops, and was not returned.\"\r\n\r\n\"Try Somerville!\"\r\n\r\nIn these words great light fell over the eager\r\ncircle.  Not because Somerville is the seat of an insane\r\nhospital.  No!  But because it is not in the Boston\r\nDirectory.\r\n\r\nIf you please, Somerville is an independent city, and\r\nso, unless John McLaughlin worked in Boston, if he lived\r\nin Somerville, he would not be in the Boston Directory.\r\n\r\nNot much!  Somerville has its own seven John\r\nMcLaughlins besides those Boston ones.\r\n\r\n\"I say, Harry, Tom, Dick--somebody fetch Somerville\r\nDirectory!\"\r\n\r\nDick flew and returned with the book.\r\n\r\n\"Here you be!  `John McLaughlin, laborer, 99 Linwood\r\nStreet!\r\n\r\n\"Victory!\"\r\n\r\nSatan's forces tremble, and as the different officers\r\nreturn to their desks \"even the ranks of Tuscany\" in that\r\nwell-bred office \"can scarce forbear to cheer.\"\r\n\r\nAs for Harrington, he bids good-by, wraps his tartan\r\naround him, and is out in the snow again.  Where Linwood\r\nStreet is he \"knows no more than the dead.\"  But somebody\r\nwill know.\r\n\r\nSomerville car.  Draw of bridge open.  Man falls into\r\nthe river and has to be rescued.  Draw closes.  Snow-\r\ndrift at Margin Street.  Shovels.  Drift open.  Centre of\r\nSomerville.  Apothecary's shop open.  \"Please, where is\r\nLinwood Street?\"\r\n\r\n\"Take your second left, cross three or four streets,\r\nturn to the right by the water-pipe, take the third\r\nright, go down hill by the schoolhouse and take second\r\nleft, and you come out at 11 Linwood Street.\"\r\n\r\nAll which Harrington does.  He experiences one\r\ncontinual burst of joy that his route does not take him\r\nthrough these detours daily.  But his professional\r\nexperience is good for him.  We have no need to describe\r\nhis false turns.  Even aniseed would have been useless in\r\nthat snow.  At last, just as the Somerville bells ring\r\nfor nine o'clock, Harrington also rings triumphant at the\r\ndoor of the little five-roomed cottage, where his lantern\r\nhas already revealed the magic number 99.\r\n\r\nRing! as for a gilt-edged special delivery!  Door\r\nthrown open by a solid man with curly red hair, unshaven\r\nsince Sunday, in his shirtsleeves and with kerosene lamp\r\nin his hand.\r\n\r\n\"Are you John McLaughlin?\"\r\n\r\n\"Indade I am; the same.\"\r\n\r\n\"And where's your sister Nora?\"\r\n\r\nThe good fellow, who had been stern before, broke\r\ndown.  \"And indade I was saying to Ellen it's an awful\r\nnight for 'em all in the gale off the coast in the ship.\r\nThe holy Virgin and the good God take care of 'em!\"\r\n\r\n\"They have taken care of them,\" said Harrington,\r\nreverently.  \"The ship is safe in dock, and your sister\r\nNora is in Roxbury, at 99 Linwood Street!\"\r\n\r\nAnd a broad grin lighted his face as he spoke the words.\r\n\r\nThere was joy in every bed and at every door of the\r\nfive rooms.  Then John hastily donned coat, cardigan, and\r\nulster.  He persuaded Harrington to drink a cup of red-\r\nhot tea which was brewing on the stove.  While the good\r\nfellow did so, and ate a St. Anne's bun, which Mrs.\r\nMcLaughlin produced in triumph, John was persuading\r\nHermann Gross, the expressman next door, to put the gray\r\ninto a light pung he had for special delivery.  By the\r\ntime Harrington went to the door two lanterns were\r\nflitting about in the snow-piled yard behind the two\r\nhouses.\r\n\r\nHarrington assisted in yoking the gray.  In five\r\nminutes he and John were defying the gale as they sped\r\nacross the silent bridge, bound south to Roxbury.  Poor\r\nlittle Nora was asleep in the parlor on the sofa.  She\r\nhad begged and begged that she need not be put to bed,\r\nand by her side her protector sat reading about the\r\nantarctic.  But of a sudden Harrington reappeared.\r\n\r\nIs it Santa Claus?\r\n\r\nIndeed it is!  Beard, hat, coat, all white with snow!\r\n\r\nAnd Santa Claus has come for the best present he will\r\ndeliver that evening!\r\n\r\nDear little Nora is wrapped in sealskins and other\r\nskins, mauds and astrakhan rugs.  She has a hot brick at\r\nher feet, and Pompey, the dog, is made to lie over them,\r\nso John McLaughlin No. 68 takes her in triumph to 99\r\nLinwood Street.\r\n\r\nThat was a Christmas to be remembered!  And Christmas\r\nmorning, after church, the Brothers of St. Patrick, which\r\nwas the men's society, and the Sodality of St. Anne's,\r\nwhich was the women's, determined on a great Twelfth-\r\nnight feast to celebrate Nora's return.\r\n\r\nIt was to show \"how these brethren love one another.\"\r\n\r\nThey proposed to take the rink.  People didn't use\r\nit for skating in winter as much as in summer.\r\n\r\nNora was to receive, with John McLaughlin and his\r\nwife to assist.  The other 74 John McLaughlins were to\r\nact as ushers.\r\n\r\nThe Salvation Army came first, led by the lass who\r\nfound Michael.\r\n\r\nProcession No. 2 was Mike and the teamsters who\r\n\"don't take nothing for such as she.\"\r\n\r\nThird, in special horse-cars, which went through from\r\nDorchester to Somerville by a vermilion edict from the\r\nWest End Company, the eleven families of that No. 99.\r\nThey stopped in Roxbury to pick up Ellen and the hostess\r\nof the Review Club.\r\n\r\nFourth, all the patrolmen who had helped and all who\r\ntried to help, led by \"cop\" No. 47.\r\n\r\nFifth, all the school children who had told the story\r\nand had made inquiries.\r\n\r\nSixth, the man who made the Somerville Directory.\r\n\r\nSeventh and last, in two barouches, Harrington and\r\nthe chiefs of staff at the general post-office.  And the\r\nboys asked Father McElroy to make a speech to all just\r\nbefore the dancing began.\r\n\r\nAnd he said:  \"The lost sheep was never lost.  She\r\nthought she was lost in the wilderness, but she was at\r\nhome, for she was met by the Christmas greeting of the\r\nworld into which the dear Lord was born!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.--It may interest the reader to know that the\r\nimportant part of this story is true.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIDEALS\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nIN ACCOUNT\r\n\r\nI have a little circle of friends, among all my other\r\nfriends quite distinct, though of them.  They are four\r\nmen and four women; the husbands more in love with\r\ntheir wives than on the days when they married them,\r\nand the wives with their husbands.  These people live\r\nfor the good of the world, to a fair extent, but much,\r\nvery much, of their lives is passed together.  Perhaps\r\nthe happiest period they ever knew was when, in\r\ndifferent subordinate capacities, they were all on the\r\nstaff of the same magazine.  Then they met daily at the\r\noffice, lunched together perforce, and could make\r\narrangements for the evening.  But, to say true, things\r\ndiffer little with them now, though that magazine long\r\nsince took wings and went to a better world.\r\n\r\nTheir names are Felix and Fausta Carter, Frederic and\r\nMary Ingham, George and Anna Haliburton, George and Julia\r\nHackmatack.\r\n\r\nI get the children's names wrong to their faces--\r\nexcept that in general their name is Legion, for they are\r\nmany--so I will not attempt them here.\r\n\r\nThese people live in very different houses, with very\r\ndifferent \"advantages,\" as the world says.  Haliburton\r\nhas grown very rich in the rag and paper business, rich\r\nenough to discard rag money and believe in gold.  He even\r\nspits at silver, which I am glad to get when I can.\r\nFrederic Ingham will never be rich.  His regular income\r\nconsists in his half-pay as a retired brevet officer in\r\nthe patriot service of Garibaldi of the year 1859.  For\r\nthe rest, he invested his money in the Brick Moon, and,\r\nas I need hardly add, insured his life in the late\r\nContinental Insurance Company.  But the Inghams find just\r\nas much in life as the Haliburtons, and Anna Haliburton\r\nconsults Polly Ingham about the shade of a flounce just\r\nas readily and as eagerly as Polly consults her about the\r\nchildren's dentistry.  They are all very fond of each\r\nother.\r\n\r\nThey get a great deal out of life, these eight,\r\npartly because they are so closely allied together.  Just\r\ntwo whist-parties, you see; or, if they go to ride, they\r\njust fill two carriages.  Eight is such a good number--\r\nmakes such a nice dinner-party.  Perhaps they see a\r\nlittle too much of each other.  That we shall never know.\r\n\r\nThey got a great deal of life, and yet they were not\r\nsatisfied.  They found that out very queerly.  They have\r\nnot many standards.  Ingham does take the \"Spectator;\"\r\nHackmatack condescends to read the \"Evening Post;\"\r\nHaliburton, who used to be in the insurance business, and\r\nkeeps his old extravagant habits, reads the \"Advertiser\"\r\nand the \"Transcript;\" all of them have the\r\n\"Christian Union,\" and all of them buy \"Harper's Weekly.\"\r\nEvery separate week of their lives they buy of the boys,\r\ninstead of subscribing; they think they may not want the\r\nnext number, but they always do.  Not one of them has\r\nread the \"Nation\" for five years, for they like to keep\r\ngood-natured.  In fact, they do not take much stock in\r\nthe general organs of opinion, and the standard books you\r\nfind about are scandalously few.  The Bible, Shakespeare,\r\nJohn Milton; Polly has Dante; Julia has \"Barclay's\r\nApology,\" with ever so many marks in it; one George has\r\n\"Owen Felltham,\" and the other is strong on Marcus\r\nAurelius.  Well, no matter about these separate things;\r\nthe uniform books besides those I named, in different\r\neditions but in every house, are the \"Arabian Nights\" and\r\n\"Robinson Crusoe.\"  Hackmatack has the priceless first\r\nedition.  Haliburton has Grandville's (the English\r\nGrandville).  Ingham has a proof copy of the Stothard.\r\nCarter has a good copy of the Cruikshank.\r\n\r\nIf you ask me which of these four I should like best,\r\nI should say as the Laureate did when they gave him his\r\nchoice of two kinds of cake, \"Both's as good as one.\"\r\n\r\nWell, \"Robinson Crusoe\" being their lay gospel and\r\ncreed, not to say epistle and psalter, it was not queer\r\nthat one night, when the election had gone awfully, and\r\nthe men were as blue as that little porcelain Osiris of\r\nmine yonder, who is so blue that he cannot stand on\r\nhis feet--it was not queer, I say, that they turned\r\ninstinctively to \"Robinson Crusoe\" for relief.\r\n\r\nNow, Robinson Crusoe was once in a very bad box\r\nindeed, and to comfort himself as well as he could, and\r\nto set the good against the evil, that he might have\r\nsomething to distinguish his case from worse, he stated\r\nimpartially, like debtor and creditor, the comforts and\r\nmiseries, thus:--\r\n\r\n\r\n         EVIL.\r\n\r\nI am cast upon a horrible\r\ndesolate island, void of all\r\nrecovery.\r\n\r\nI am singled out and separated,\r\nas it were, from all the world, to\r\nbe miserable.\r\n\r\n        GOOD.\r\nBut I am alive, and not\r\ndrowned as all my hope of\r\nship's company were.\r\nBut I am singled out,\r\ntoo, from the ship's crew\r\nto be spared from death.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd so the debtor and creditor account goes on.\r\n\r\nJulia Hackmatack read this aloud to them--the whole\r\nof it--and they agreed, as Robinson says, not so much for\r\ntheir posterity as to keep their thoughts from daily\r\nporing on their trials, that for each family they would\r\nmake such a balance.  What might not come of it?  Perhaps\r\na partial nay, perhaps a perfect cure!\r\n\r\nSo they determined that on the instant they would go\r\nto work, and two in the smoking-room, two in the dining-\r\nroom, two in George's study, and two in the parlor, they\r\nshould in the next halfhour make up their lists of good\r\nand evil.  Here are the results:--\r\n\r\nFREDERIC AND MARY INGHAM.\r\n\r\n           GOOD.                           EVIL.\r\n\r\nWe have three nice boys        But the door-bell rings all\r\nand three nice girls.          the time.\r\n\r\nWe have enough to eat,         But the coal bill is awful,\r\ndrink, and wear.               and the Larrabee furnace has\r\n                               given out.  The firm that made\r\n                               it has gone up, and no castings\r\n                               can be got to mend it.\r\n\r\nWe have more books than        But our friends borrow our\r\nwe can read, and do not care   books, and only return odd\r\nto read many newspapers.       volumes.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have many very dear         But we are behindhand 143\r\nfriends--enough.               names on our lists of calls.\r\n\r\nWe have health in our          But the children may be\r\nfamily.                        sick.  The Lowndes children are.\r\n\r\nWe seem to be of some          But Mrs. Hogarth has left\r\nuse in the world.              Fred $200 for the poor, and he\r\n                               is afraid he shall spend it wrong.\r\n\r\n                               The country has gone to the\r\n                               dogs.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 GEORGE AND ANNA HALIBURTON.\r\n\r\n           GOOD.

People vote as if they were\r\n                               possessed.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    GEORGE AND JULIA HACKMATACK\r\n\r\n           GOOD.

So are the girls.           good at school, except\r\nThey are splendid children.        measles, whooping-cough, and\r\n                                   scarlet fever.\r\n\r\nOld Mr. Porter died last           But the gas-meter lies;\r\nweek, and Felix gets promotion     and the gas company wants to\r\nin the office.                     have it lie.\r\n\r\nThe lost volume of Fichte          But the Athenaeum is always\r\nwas left on the door-step last    calling in its books to examine\r\nnight by some one who rang the    them, and making us say where\r\nbell and ran away.  It is rather   Mr. Fred Curtis's books are.\r\nwet, but when it is bound will     As if we cared.\r\nlook nicely.\r\n\r\nThe mistress of the Arbella        But our drains smell\r\nSchool is dead.                    awfully, though the Board of\r\n                                   Health says they do not.\r\n\r\n                                   We have to go to evening\r\n                                   parties among our friends, or\r\n                                   seem stuck up.  We hate to go,\r\n                                   and wish there were none.  We\r\n                                   had rather come here.\r\n\r\n                                    The increasing\r\n                                  worthlessness of the franchise.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith these papers they gathered all in the study just\r\nas the clock struck nine, and, in good old Boston\r\nfashion, Silas was bringing in some hot oysters.  They\r\nate the oysters, which were good--trust Anna for that--\r\nand then the women read the papers, while the smoking men\r\nsmoked and pondered.\r\n\r\nThey all recognized the gravity of the situation.\r\nStill, as Julia said, they felt better already.  It was\r\nlike having the doctor come: you knew the worst, and\r\ncould make ready for it.\r\n\r\nThey did not discuss the statements much.  They had\r\ndiscussed them too much in severalty.  They did agree\r\nthat they should be left to Felix to report upon the next\r\nevening.  He was, so to speak, to post them, to strike\r\nout from each side the quantities which could be\r\neliminated, and leave the equations so simplified that\r\nthe eight might determine what they should do about it--\r\nindeed, what they could do about it.\r\n\r\nThe visitors put on their \"things\"--how strange that\r\nthat word should once have meant \"parliaments!\"--kissed\r\ngood-by so far as they were womanly, and went home.\r\nGeorge Haliburton screwed down the gas, and they went to bed.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nSTRIKING THE BALANCE\r\n\r\nThe next night they went to see Warren at the Museum.\r\nThat probably helped them.  After the play they met by\r\nappointment at the Carters'.  Felix read his\r\n\r\nREPORT.\r\n\r\n1.  NUMBER.--There are twenty-one reasons for\r\ncongratulation, twenty-four for regret.  But of the\r\ntwenty-four, four are the same; namely, the cursed\r\npolitical prospect of the country.  Counting that as one\r\nonly, there are twenty-one on each side.\r\n\r\n2.  EVIL.--The twenty-one evils may be classified\r\nthus: political, 1; social, 12; physical, 5; terrors, 3.\r\n\r\nAll the physical evils would be relieved by living in\r\na temperate climate, instead of this abomination, which\r\nis not a climate, to which our ancestors were sold by the\r\ncupidity of the Dutch.\r\n\r\nThe political evil would be ended by leaving the\r\njurisdiction of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe social evils, which are a majority of all, would\r\nbe reduced by residence in any place where there were not\r\nso many people.\r\n\r\nThe terrors properly belong to all the classes.  In\r\na decent climate, in a country not governed by its vices,\r\nand a community not crowded, the three terrors would be\r\nmaterially abated, if not put to an end.\r\n\r\nRespectfully submitted,\r\n\r\nFELIX CARTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow they discussed it now!  Talk?  I think so!  They\r\nall talked awhile, and no one listened.  But they had to\r\nstop when Phenice brought in the Welsh rare-bit (good\r\nbefore bed, but a little indigestible, unless your\r\nconscience is stainless), and Felix then put in a word.\r\n\r\n\"Now I tell you, this is not nonsense.  Why not do\r\nwhat Winslow and Standish and those fellows thought they\r\nwere doing when they sailed?  Why not go to a climate\r\nlike France, with milder winters and cooler summers than\r\nhere?  You want some winter, you want some summer.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hate centipedes and scorpions,\" said Anna.\r\n\r\n\"There's no need of them.  There's a place in Mexico,\r\nnot a hundred miles from the sea, where you can have your\r\ntemperature just as you like.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stuff!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, it is not stuff at all,\" said poor Felix,\r\neagerly.  \"I do not mean just one spot.  But you live in\r\nthis valley, you know.  If you find it is growing hot,\r\nyou move about a quarter of a mile to another place\r\nhigher up.  If you find that hot, why you have another\r\nhouse a little higher.  Don't you see?  Then, when winter\r\ncomes, you move down.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are there many people there?\" asked Haliburton; \"and\r\ndo they make many calls?\"\r\n\r\n\"There are a good many people, but they are a gentle\r\nset.  They never quarrel.  They are a little too high up\r\nfor the revolutions, and there is something\r\ntranquillizing about the place; they seldom die,\r\nnone are sick, need no aguardiente, do what the head of\r\nthe village tells them to do--only he never has any\r\noccasion to tell them.  They never make calls.\"\r\n\r\n\"I like that,\" said Ingham.  That patriarchal system\r\nis the true system of government.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where is this place?\" said Anna, incredulously.\r\n\r\n\"I have been trying to remember all day, but I can't.\r\nIt is in Mexico, I know.  It is on this side of Mexico.\r\nIt tells all about it in an old `Harper'--oh, a good many\r\nyears ago--but I never bound mine; there are always one\r\nor two missing every year.  I asked Fausta to look for\r\nit, but she was busy.  I thought,\" continued poor Felix,\r\na little crestfallen, \"one of you might remember.\"\r\n\r\nNo, nobody remembered; and nobody felt much like\r\ngoing to the public library to look, on Carter's rather\r\nvague indications.  In fact, it was a suggestion of\r\nHaliburton's that proved more popular.\r\n\r\nHaliburton said he had not laid in his coal.  They\r\nall said the same.  \"Now,\" said he, \"the coal of this\r\ncrowd for this winter will cost a thousand dollars, if\r\nyou add in the kindling and the matches, and patching the\r\nfurnace pots and sweeping the chimneys.\"\r\n\r\nTo this they agreed.\r\n\r\n\"It is now Wednesday.  Let us start Saturday for\r\nMemphis, take a cheap boat to New Orleans, go thence to\r\nVera Cruz by steamer, explore the ground, buy the houses\r\nif we like, and return by the time we can do without\r\nfires next spring.  Our board will cost less than it\r\nwould here, for it is there the beef comes from.  And the\r\nthousand dollars will pay the fares both ways.\"\r\n\r\nThe women, with one voice, cried, \"And the children?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes,\" cried the eager adventurer.  \"I had\r\nforgotten the children.  Well, they are all well, are\r\nthey not?\"\r\n\r\nYes; all were well.\r\n\r\n\"Then we will take them with us as far as Yellow\r\nSprings, in Ohio, and leave them for the fall and winter\r\nterms at Antioch College.  They will be enough better\r\ntaught than they are at the Kydd School, and they will\r\nget no scarlet fever.  Nobody is ever sick there.  They\r\nwill be better cared for than my children are when they\r\nare left to me, and they will be seven hundred miles\r\nnearer to us than if they were here.  The little ones can\r\ngo to the Model School, the middling ones to the Academy,\r\nand the oldest can go to college.  How many are there,\r\nFelix?\"\r\n\r\nFelix said there were twenty-nine.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said the arithmetical George, \"it is the\r\ncheapest place I ever knew.  Why, their Seniors get along\r\nfor three hundred dollars a year, and squeeze more out of\r\nlife than I do out of twenty thousand.  The little ones\r\nwon't cost at that rate.  A hundred and fifty dollars for\r\ntwenty-nine children; how much is that, Polly?\"\r\n\r\n\"Forty-three hundred and fifty dollars, of course,\"\r\nsaid she.\r\n\r\n\"I thought so.  Well, don't you see, we shall save\r\nthat in wages to these servants we are boarding here, of\r\nwhom there are eleven, who cost us, say, six dollars a\r\nweek; that is, sixty-six dollars for twenty weeks is\r\nthirteen hundred and twenty dollars.  We won't buy any\r\nclothes, but live on the old ones, and make the children\r\nwear their big brothers' and sisters'.  There's a saving\r\nof thirty-seven hundred dollars for thirty-seven of us.\r\nWhy, we shall make money!  I tell you what, if you'll do\r\nit, I'll pay all the bills till we come home.  If you\r\nlike, you shall then each pay me three-quarters of your\r\nlast winter's accounts, and I'll charge any difference\r\nto profit and loss.  But I shall make by the bargain.\"\r\n\r\nThe women doubted if they could be ready.  But it\r\nproved they could.  Still they did not start Saturday;\r\nthey started Monday, in two palace-cars.  They left the\r\nchildren, all delighted with the change, at Antioch on\r\nWednesday--a little tempted to spend the winter there\r\nthemselves; but, this temptation well resisted, they sped\r\non to Mexico.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nFULFILMENT\r\n\r\nSuch a tranquil three days on the Mississippi, which\r\nwas as an autumn flood, and revealed himself as indeed\r\nKing of Waters!  Such delightful three days in\r\nhospitable New Orleans!  Might it not be possible to\r\ntarry even here?  \"No,\" cried the inexorable George.\r\n\"We have put our hand to the plough.  Who will turn\r\nback?\"  Two days of abject wretchedness on the Gulf of\r\nMexico.  \"Why were we born?  Why did we not die before\r\nwe left solid land?\"  And then the light-house at Vera Cruz.\r\n\r\n\"Lo, land! and all was well.\"\r\n\r\nWhat a splendid city!  Why had nobody told them of\r\nthis queen on the sea-shore?  Red and white towers,\r\ncupolas, battlements!  It was all like a story-book.\r\nWhen they landed, to be sure, it was not quite so big a\r\nplace as they had fancied from all this show; but for\r\nthis they did not care.  To land--that was enough.  Had\r\nthey landed on a sand-spit, they would have been in\r\nheaven.  No more swaying to and fro as they lay in bed,\r\nno more stumbling to and fro as they walked.  They\r\nrefused the amazed Mexicans who wanted them to ride to\r\nthe hotel.  To walk steadily was in itself a luxury.\r\n\r\nAnd then it was not long before the men had selected\r\nthe little caravan of horses and mules which were to\r\ncarry them on their expedition of discovery.  Some valley\r\nof paradise, where a man could change his climate from\r\nmidwinter to midsummer by a journey of a mile.  Did the\r\nconsul happen to have heard of any such valley?\r\n\r\nHad he heard of them?  He had heard of fifty.\r\nHe had not, indeed, heard of much else.  How could\r\nhe help hearing of them?\r\n\r\nCould the consul, then, recommend one or two valleys\r\nwhich might be for sale?  Or was it, perhaps, impossible\r\nto buy a foothold in such an Eden?\r\n\r\nFor sale!  There was nothing in the country, so far\r\nas the friend knew to whom the consul presented them,\r\nwhich was not for sale.  Anywhere in Queretaro; or why\r\nshould they not go to the Baxio?  No; that was too flat\r\nand too far off.  There were pretty places round Xalapa.\r\nOh, plenty of plantations for sale.  But they need not go\r\nso far.  Anywhere on the rise of Chiquihiti.\r\n\r\nWas the friend quite sure that there were no plumbers\r\nin the regions he named?\r\n\r\n\"Never a plumber in Mexico.\"\r\n\r\nAny life-insurance men?\r\n\r\n\"Not one.\"  The prudent friend did not add, \"Risk too high.\"\r\n\r\nWere the public schools graded schools or district schools?\r\n\r\n\"Not a public school in six provinces.\"\r\n\r\nWould the neighbors be offended if we do not call?\r\n\r\n\"Cut your throats if you did.\"\r\n\r\nDid the friend think there would be many tramps?\r\n\r\nThe friend seemed more doubtful here, but suggested\r\nthat the occasional use of a six-shooter reduced the\r\nnumber, and gave a certain reputation to the premises\r\nwhere it was employed which diminished much tramping\r\nafterward, and said that the law did not object to this\r\nmethod.\r\n\r\nThey returned to a dinner of fish, for which Vera\r\nCruz is celebrated.  \"If what the man says be true,\" said\r\nIngham, \"we must be very near heaven.\"\r\n\r\nIt was now in November.  Oh, the glory of that ride,\r\nas they left Vera Cruz and through a wilderness of color\r\njogged slowly on to their new paradise!\r\n\r\n\"Through Eden four glad couples took their way.\"\r\n\r\nHigher and higher.  This wonder and that.  Not a blade\r\nof grass such as they ever saw before, not a chirping\r\ncricket such as they ever heard before; a hundred\r\nbright-winged birds, and not one that they had ever\r\nseen before.  Higher and higher.  Trees, skies, clouds,\r\nflowers, beasts, birds, insects, all new and all\r\nlovely.\r\n\r\nThe final purchase was of one small plantation, with\r\na house large enough for a little army, yet without a\r\nstair.  Oranges, lemons, pomegranates, mangoes, bananas,\r\npine-apples, coffee, sugar--what did not ripen in those\r\nperennial gardens?  Half a mile above there were two\r\nsmaller houses belonging to the same estate; half a mile\r\nabove, another was purchased easily.  This was too cold\r\nto stay in in November, but in June and July and August\r\nthe temperature would be sixty-six, without change.\r\n\r\nThey sent back the mules.  A telegram from Vera Cruz\r\nbrought from Boston, in fifteen days, the best books\r\nin the world, the best piano in the world, a few boxes of\r\ncolors for the artists, a few reams of paper, and a few\r\ndozen of pencils for the men.  And then began four months\r\nof blessed life.  Never a gas-bill nor a water-leak,\r\nnever a crack in the furnace nor a man to put in coal,\r\nnever a request to speak for the benefit of the Fenians,\r\nnever the necessity of attending at a primary meeting.\r\nThe ladies found in their walks these gentle Mexican\r\nchildren, simple, happy, civil, and with the strange idea\r\nthat the object for which life is given is that men may\r\nlive.  They came home with new wealth untold every day--\r\nof ipomoea, convolvulus, passion-flowers, and orchids.\r\nThe gentlemen brought back every day a new species, even\r\na new genus,--a new illustration of evolution, or a new\r\nmystery to be accounted for by the law of natural\r\nselection.  Night was all sleep; day was all life.\r\nDigestion waited upon appetite; appetite waited upon\r\nexercise; exercise waited upon study; study waited upon\r\nconversation; conversation waited upon love.  Could it be\r\nthat November was over?  Can life run by so fast?  Can it\r\nbe that Christmas has come?  Can we let life go by so\r\nfast?  Is it possible that it is the end of January?  We\r\ncannot let life go so fast.  Really, is this St.\r\nValentine's Day!  When ever did life go so fast?\r\n\r\nAnd with the 1st of March the mules were ordered, and\r\nthey moved to the next higher level.  The men and women\r\nwalked.  And there, on the grade of a new climate,\r\nthey began on a new botany, on new discoveries, and happy\r\nlife found new forms as they began again.\r\n\r\nSo sped April and so sped May.  Life had its\r\nbattles,--oh yes, because it was life.  But they were not\r\nthe pettiest of battles.  They were not the battles of\r\nprisoners shut up, to keep out the weather, in cells\r\nfifteen feet square.  They fought, if they fought, with\r\nGod's air in their veins, and God's warm sunshine around\r\nthem, and God's blue sky above them.  So they did what\r\nthey could, as they wrote and read and drew and painted,\r\nas they walked and ran and swam and rode and drove, as\r\nthey encouraged this peon boy and taught that peon girl,\r\nsmoothed this old woman's pillow and listened to that old\r\nman's story, as they analyzed these wonderful flowers, as\r\nthey tasted these wonderful fruits, as they climbed these\r\nwonderful mountains, or, at night, as they pointed the\r\ntelescope through this cloudless and stainless sky.\r\n\r\nWith all their might they lived.  And they were so\r\nmany, and there were so many round them to whom their\r\ncoming was a new life, that they lived in love, and every\r\nday drank in of the infinite elixir.\r\n\r\nBut June came.  The mules are sent for again.  Again\r\nthey walked a quarter of a mile.  And here in the little\r\nwhitewashed cottage, with only a selection from the books\r\nbelow, with two guitars and a flute in place of the\r\npiano,--here they made ready for three weeks of June.\r\nOnly three weeks; for on the 29th was the\r\nCommencement at Antioch, and Jane and Walter and Florence\r\nwere to take their degrees.  There would need five days\r\nfrom Vera Cruz to reach them.  And so this summer was to\r\nbe spent in the North with them, before October should\r\nbring all the children and the parents to the land of the\r\nopen sky.  Three busy weeks between the 1st and the 22d,\r\nin which all the pictures must be finished, Ingham's\r\nnovel must be revised, Haliburton's articles completed,\r\nthe new invention for measuring power must be gauged and\r\ntested, the dried flowers must be mounted and packed, the\r\npreserved fruits must be divided for the Northern\r\nfriends.  Three happy weeks of life eventful, but life\r\nwithout crowding, and, above all, without interruption.\r\n\"Think of it,\" cried Felix, as they took their last walk\r\namong the lava crags, the door-bell has not rung all this\r\nlast winter.'\"\r\n\r\n\"`This happy old king\r\nOn his gate he did swing,\r\nBecause there was never a door-bell to ring.'\"\r\n\r\nThis was Julia's impromptu reply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nHOME AGAIN\r\n\r\nSo came one more journey.  Why can we not go and come\r\nwithout this musty steamer, these odious smells, this\r\nfood for dogs, and this surge--ah, how remorseless!--of\r\nthe cruel sea?\r\n\r\nBut even this will end.  Once more the Stars and\r\nStripes!  A land of furnaces and of waterpipes, a land of\r\nbeggars and of caucuses, a land of gas-meters and of\r\nliars, a land of pasteboard and of cards, a land of\r\netiquettes and of bad spelling, but still their country!\r\nA land of telegraphs, which told in an instant, as they\r\nlanded on the levee, that all the twenty-nine were well,\r\nand begged them to be at the college on Tuesday evening,\r\nso as to see \"Much Ado about Nothing.\"  For at Antioch\r\nthey act a play the night before Commencement.  A land of\r\nPullman's palace-cars.  And lo! they secured sections 5\r\nand 6, 7 and 8, in the \"Mayflower.\"  Just time to kiss\r\nthe baby of one friend, and to give a basket of guavas to\r\nanother, and then whir for Cincinnati and Xenia and\r\nYellow Springs!\r\n\r\nHow beautiful were the live-oaks and the magnolias!\r\nHow fresh the green of the cotton!  How black the faces\r\nof the little negroes, and how beyond dispute the perfume\r\nof the baked peanuts at the stations where sometimes they\r\nhad to stop for wood and water!  Even the heavy pile of\r\nsmoke above Cincinnati was golden with the hopes of a\r\nnew-born day as they rushed up to the Ohio River, and as\r\nthey crossed it.  And then, the land of happy homes!  It\r\nwas Kapnist who said to me that the most favored places\r\nin the world were the larger villages in Ohio.  He had\r\ngone everywhere, too.  Xenia, and a perfect breakfast at\r\nthe station, then the towers of Antioch, then the\r\ntwenty-nine children waving their handkerchiefs as\r\nthe train rushes in!\r\n\r\nHow much there was to tell, to show, to ask for, and\r\nto see!  How much pleasure they gave with their\r\ncochineal, their mangoes, their bananas, their hat-bands\r\nfor the boys, and their fans for the girls!  Yes; and how\r\nmuch more they took from nutbrown faces, from smiles\r\nbeaming from ear to ear, from the boy so tall that he\r\nlooked down upon his father, from the girl so womanly\r\nthat you asked if her mother were not masquerading.  \"You\r\nrascal Ozro, you do not pretend that those trousers were\r\nmade for you?  Why, my boy, you disgrace the family.\"  \"I\r\nhope not, papa; I had ninety-eight in the botany\r\nexamination, passed with honors in Greek, and we beat the\r\nBuckeye Club to nothing in the return match yesterday.\"\r\n\"You did, you little beggar?\" the proud papa replied.\r\n\"You ran all the better, I suppose, because you had\r\nnothing to trip you.\"  And so on, and so on.  The\r\nchildren did not live in paradise, perhaps, but this\r\nseems very like the kingdom come!\r\n\r\nAnd after commencements and the president's party, up\r\nto the Yellow Springs platform came two unusual palaces,\r\nspecially engaged.  And one was named the \"Valparaiso,\"\r\nand the other, as it happened, the \"Bethlehem.\"  And they\r\ntook all the children, and by good luck Mrs. Tucker was\r\ngoing also, and three or four of the college girls, and\r\nthey took them.  So there were forty-two in all.  And\r\nthey sped and sped, without change of cars, save as\r\nBethlehem visited Paradise and Paradise visited\r\nBethlehem, till they came to New Salem, which is the\r\nstation men buy tickets for when they would go to the\r\nbeach below Quonochontaug, where the eight and the\r\ntwenty-nine were to make their summer home before the\r\nfinal emigration.\r\n\r\nThey do not live at Quonochontaug, but to that post-\r\noffice are their letters sent.  They live in a hamlet of\r\ntheir own, known to the neighbors as the Little Gau.\r\nFour large houses, whitewashed without and within, with\r\ndeep piazzas all around, the roofs of which join the\r\nroofs of the houses themselves, and run up on all sides\r\nto one point above the centre.  In each house a hall some\r\ntwenty feet by fifty, and in the hall,--what is not in\r\nthe hall?--maybe a piano, maybe a fish-rod, maybe a rifle\r\nor a telescope, a volume of sermons or a volume of songs,\r\na spinning-wheel, or a guitar, or a battledore.  You\r\nmight ask widely for what you needed, for study or for\r\nplay, and you would find it, though it were a deep divan\r\nof Osiat or a chibouque from Stamboul--you would find it\r\nin one of these simple whitewashed halls.\r\n\r\nLittle Gau is so near the sea-shore that every day\r\nthey go down to the beach to bathe, and the beach is so\r\nnear the Gulf Stream that the swim is--well, perfection.\r\nStill, the first day the ladies would not swim.  They had\r\nthe trunks to open, they said, and the closets to\r\narrange.  And the four men and the fourteen boys went to\r\nthat bath of baths alone.  And as Felix, the cynic\r\ngrumbler, ran races naked on the beach with his boy\r\nand the boy beat him, even Felix was heard to say, \"How\r\nlittle man needs here below to be perfectly happy!\"\r\n\r\nAnd at the Little Gau they spent the months from the\r\nFourth of July to the 13th of October--two great days in\r\nhistory--getting ready for Mexico.  New sewing-machines\r\nwere bought, and the fall of the stream from the lake was\r\ntaught to run the treadles.  No end of clothing was got\r\nready for a country which needs none; no end of memoranda\r\nmade for the last purchases; no end of lists of books\r\nprepared, which they could read in that land of leisure.\r\nAnd on the 14th of October, with a passing sigh, they\r\nbade good-by to boats and dogs and cows and horses and\r\nneighbors and beaches--almost to sun and moon, which had\r\nsmiled on so much happiness, and went back to Boston to\r\nmake the last bargains, to pay the last bills, and to say\r\nthe last good-byes.\r\n\r\nAfter one day of bill-paying and house-advertising\r\nand farewelling, they met at Ingham's to \"tell their\r\ntimes.\"  And Julia told of her farewell call on dear Mrs.\r\nBlake.\r\n\r\n\"The saint!\" said she; \"she does not see as well as\r\nshe did.  But it was just lovely there.  There was the\r\ngreat bronze Japanese stork, which seemed so friendly,\r\nand the great vases, and her flowers as fresh as ever,\r\nand her books everywhere.  She found something for Tom\r\nand Maud to play with, just as she used to for Ben and\r\nHorace.  And we sat and talked of Mexico and Antioch and\r\neverything.  I asked her if her eyes troubled her,\r\nand I was delighted because it seems they do not trouble\r\nher at all.  She told all about Swampscott and her\r\ngrandchildren.  I asked her if the dust never troubled\r\nthem on Gladstone Street, but she says it does not at\r\nall; and she told all about her son's family in Hong-\r\nKong.  I asked her if the failure of Rupee & Lac annoyed\r\nthem, and she said not at all, and I was so glad, for I\r\nhad been so afraid for them; and then she told about how\r\nmuch they were enjoying Macaulay.  Then I asked her if\r\nthe new anvil factory on the other side of the street did\r\nnot trouble her, and she said not at all.  And when I\r\nsaid, `How can that be?' she said, `Why, Julia dear, we\r\ndo not let these things trouble us, don't you see.  If I\r\nwere you, I would not let such things trouble me.'\"\r\n\r\nGeorge Haliburton laid down his knife as Julia told\r\nthe story.  \"Do you remember Rabia at Mecca?  Yes, they\r\nall remembered Rabia at Mecca:--\r\n\r\n\"Oh heart, weak follower of the weak,\r\n  That thou shouldst traverse land and sea;\r\nIn this far place that God to seek\r\n  Who long ago had come to thee!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Why should we not stay here, and not let these\r\nthings trouble us?\"\r\n\r\nWhy not, indeed?\r\n\r\nAnd they stayed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nONE CENT\r\n\r\nA CHRISTMAS STORY\r\n\r\nDOWN\r\n\r\nMr. Starr rose very early that day.  The sun was not\r\nup.  Yet, certainly, it was too light to strike a match.\r\nAh, Mr. Starr, a match may be an economy!\r\n\r\nSo it was that when, as always, the keys jingled out\r\nfrom his trousers pockets upon the floor, and the money\r\nas well, one cent rolled under the bureau unseen by Mr.\r\nStarr.  He went down to his work now, after he had\r\ngathered up the rest of the money and the keys, and\r\nanswered yesterday's letters.\r\n\r\nThen, of course, he could loiter over his breakfast.\r\n\r\nBut not too long.  Clara, his wife, was in good\r\nspirits, and the boys were very jolly, but Mr. Starr, all\r\nthe same, did the duty next his hand.  He \"kissed her\r\ngood-by,\" and started down-town.  Edgar stopped, him to\r\nask for fifty cents for his lunch; the postman wanted\r\nfifteen for an underpaid parcel; Susan, the maid, asked\r\nfor ten for some extra milk; and then he kissed his hand\r\nto the parlor window, and was off.\r\n\r\nNo!  He was not off.\r\n\r\nFor Clara threw up the window and waved her lily\r\nhand.  Mr. Starr ran back to the door.  She flung it\r\nopen.\r\n\r\n\"My dear John, here is your best coat.  That coat you\r\nhave on has a frayed button.  I saw it yesterday, and I\r\ncannot bear to have you wear it at the Board.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dear Clara, what a saint you are!\"  One more kiss,\r\nand Mr. Starr departed.\r\n\r\nAnd loyally he did the duty next his hand.  He\r\nstopped and signed the sewerage petition; he looked in on\r\npoor Colt and said a cheerful word to him; he bade\r\nWoolley, the fruit man, send a barrel of Nonesuches to\r\nold Mrs. Cowen; he was on time at the Board meeting, took\r\nthe chair, and they changed the constitution.  He looked\r\nin at the office and told Mr. Freemantle he should be\r\nlate, but that he would look at the letters when he came\r\nback, and then, ho! for East Boston!\r\n\r\nIf only you knew, dear readers, that to East Boston\r\nyou must go by a ferry-boat, as if it were named\r\nGreenbush, or Brooklyn, or Camden.\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Starr took the street car after he had crossed\r\nthe ferry, to go into the unknown parts of East Boston,\r\nhe did notice that he gave the conductor his last ticket.\r\nBut what of that?  \"End of the route\" came, and he girded\r\nhis loins, trudged over to the pottery he was in search\r\nof, found it at last, found the foreman and gave his\r\norders, and then, through mud unspeakable, waded\r\nback to the street car.  He was the only passenger.\r\nNo wonder!  The only wonder was that there was a car.\r\n\r\n\"Ticket, sir,\" said the conductor, after half a mile.\r\n\r\nMR. STARR (SMILING).  I have no ticket, but you\r\nmay sell me a dollar's worth. (FEELS FOR POCKETBOOK.)\r\nHello!  I have not my pocketbook; changed my coat.\r\n\r\nCONDUCTOR (SAVAGELY).

Fare's\r\nsix cents.\r\n\r\nMR. STARR (WELL REMEMBERING THE CENT, WHICH IS,\r\nALAS UNDER THE BUREAU, AND GROVELLING FOR IT IN BOTH\r\nPOCKETS).

(EXEUNT JOHN\r\nCRADOCK, HORSES AND CHILDREN.)\r\n\r\nHalf amused, half ashamed, Mr. Starr picks up the\r\ncoin, which he also supposes to be half an eagle.\r\n\r\nIt proves to be a bright penny, just from the mint.\r\n\r\nMr. Starr lays it with delight upon the five-cent\r\nnickel.\r\n(ENTER A STREET CAR, L.

Mr. Starr bade\r\nhim good-by, and advised him a little about the man be\r\nwas to see in Dresden.  He met Herr Birnebaum, and talked\r\nwith him a little about the chemistry of enamels.  Oddly\r\nenough, Fonseca was there, the attache, the same whom\r\nClara had taken to drive at Bethlehem.  Mr. Starr talked\r\na little Spanish with him.

CROWD WAVES\r\nHANDKERCHIEFS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCENE III\r\nCHRISTMAS--THE END\r\n\r\nAt Mr. Starr's Christmas dinner, beside their cousins\r\nfrom Harvard College and their second cousins from\r\nWellesley College and their third cousins from Bradford\r\nAcademy, they had young Clifford, the head book-keeper.\r\nAs he came in, joining the party on their way home from\r\nchurch, he showed Mr. Starr a large parcel.\r\n\r\n\"It's the `Alaska's' mail, and I thought you might\r\nlike to see it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, well!\" said Mr. Starr, \"it is Christmas, and I\r\nthink the letters can wait, at least till after dinner.\"\r\n\r\nAnd a jolly dinner it was.  Turkey for those who\r\nwished, and goose for those who chose goose.  And when\r\nthe Washington pie and the Marlborough pudding came, the\r\nsquash, the mince, the cranberry-tart, and the blazing\r\nplum-pudding, then the children were put through their\r\ngenealogical catechism.\r\n\r\n\"Will, who is your mother's father's mother's father?\"\r\n\r\n\"Lucy Pico, sir!\" and then great shouting.  Then was\r\nit that Mr. Starr told the story which the reader has\r\nread in scene one,--of the perils which may come when a\r\nman has not a penny.  He did not speak hastily, nor cast\r\nreproach on Clara for her care of the button.  Over\r\nthat part of the story he threw a cautious veil.  But to\r\nboys and girls he pointed a terrible lesson of the value\r\nof one penny.\r\n\r\n\"How dangerous, papa, to drop it into a box for the\r\nheathen!\"\r\n\r\nBut little Tom found this talk tiresome, and asked\r\nleave to slip away, teasing Clifford as he went about\r\nsome postage-stamps Clifford had promised him.\r\n\r\n\"Go bring the parcel I left on the hall table, and\r\nyour papa will give you some Spanish stamps.\"\r\n\r\nSo the boy brought the mail.\r\n\r\n\"What in the world is this?\" cried Mr. Starr, as he\r\ncut open the great envelope; and more and more amazed he\r\nwas as he ran down the lines:--\r\n\r\n\"`Much Esteemed and Respected Senor, Don JOHN STARR,\r\nKnight of the Order of the Golden Fleece:\r\n\r\n\"`SENOR,--It is with true yet inexpressible\r\nsatisfaction that I write this private note, that I may\r\nbe the first of your friends in Madrid to say to you that\r\nthe order for your creation as a Knight Companion of the\r\nmuch esteemed and truly venerable Order of the Golden\r\nFleece passed the seals of the Chancellerie yesterday.\r\nHis Majesty is pleased to say that your views on the\r\npacification of Porto Rico coincide precisely with his\r\nown; that the hands of the government will be\r\nstrengthened as with the force of giants when he\r\ncommunicates them to the very excellent and much\r\nhonored governor of the island, and that, as a mark of\r\nhis confidence, he has the pleasure of sending to you the\r\ncordon of the order, and of asking your acceptance.'\r\n\r\n\"My dear Lady Dulcinea del Toboso, that is what came\r\nto you when that Cradock man threw a cent into the mud\r\nfor me.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, papa, what are the other letters?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, what are they?  Here is English; it's from\r\nWendell.  H'm--h'm--h'm.  Shortpassage.  Worcestershire--\r\nh'm--Wedgewood--h'm--Staffordshire--h'm.  Why, Clara,\r\nGeorge, listen:\r\n\r\n\"`I suppose you will not be surprised when I say that\r\nyour suggestion made on the deck of the `Samaria,' as to\r\noxalate of strontium, was received with surprise by Herr\r\nFernow and Herr Klee.

They are so much\r\ndelighted with these results that they have formed a\r\nsyndicate with the Winkels, of Potsdam, and the\r\nSchonhoffs, of Berlin, to undertake the manufacture in\r\nGermany; and I am instructed to ask you whether you will\r\naccept a round sum, say 150,000 marks, for the German\r\npatent, or join them, say as a partner, with twenty per\r\ncent of stock in their adventure.'\r\n\r\n\"I think so,\" said Mr. Starr.  \"That is what the\r\nbright penny comes to at compound interest.

His home, alas, was but an indifferent attic\r\nin one of the southern suburbs of Boston.  He had been\r\nwalking; but he was now standing still, at the well-known\r\ncorner of Massachusetts and Columbus Avenues.\r\n\r\nAs often happens, Frederick Dane had an opportunity\r\nto wait at this corner a quarter of an hour.  As he\r\nlooked around him on the silent houses, he could not but\r\nobserve the polling-booth, which a watchful city\r\ngovernment had placed in the street, a few days before,\r\nin preparation for the election which was to take place\r\nthree weeks afterward.  Dane is of an inquiring temper,\r\nand seeing that the polling-booth had a door and the door\r\nhad a keyhole, he tried in the keyhole a steel key which\r\nhe had picked up in Dock Square the day before.  Almost\r\nto his surprise, the key governed the lock at once, and\r\nhe found himself able to walk in.\r\n\r\nHe left the door wide open, and the gaslight\r\nstreaming in revealed to him the aspect of the cells\r\narranged for Australian voting.  The rails were all in\r\ntheir places, and the election might take place the very\r\nnext day.  It instantly occurred to Dane that he might\r\nsave the five cents which otherwise he would have given\r\nto his masters of the street railway, and be the next\r\nmorning three miles nearer his work, if he spent the\r\nnight in the polling-cabin.  He looked around for a\r\nminute or two, and found some large rolls of street\r\nposters, which had been left there by some disappointed\r\ncanvasser the year before, and which had accompanied one\r\ncell of the cabin in its travels.  Dane is a prompt man,\r\nand, in a minute more, he had locked the door behind him,\r\nhad struck a wax taper which he had in his cigar-box, had\r\nrolled the paper roll out on the floor, to serve as a\r\npillow.  In five minutes more, covered with his heavy\r\ncoat, he lay on the floor, sleeping as soundly as he had\r\nslept the year before, when he found himself on the lee\r\nside of an iceberg under Peary's command.\r\n\r\nThis is perhaps unnecessary detail, by way of saying\r\nthat this is the beginning of the arrangement which a\r\ncity, not very intelligent, will make in the next century\r\nfor unsettled people, whose own houses are not agreeable\r\nto them.  There exist in Boston at this moment three or\r\nfour hundred of the polling-booths,--nice little houses,\r\nenough better than most of the peasantry of most of\r\nEurope ever lived in.  They are, alas, generally packed\r\nup in lavender and laid away for ten months of the\r\nyear.  But in the twentieth century we shall send them\r\ndown to the shores of islands and other places where\r\npeople like to spend the summer, and we shall utilize\r\nthem, not for the few hours of an election only, but all\r\nthe year round.  This will not then be called\r\n\"Nationalism,\" it will be called \"Democracy;\" and that is\r\na very good name when it is applied to a very good thing.\r\n\r\nDane was an old soldier and an old seaman.  He was\r\nnot troubled by disagreeable dreams, and in the morning,\r\nwhen the street-cars began to travel, he was awaked a\r\nlittle after sunrise, by their clatter on the corner.  He\r\nfelt well satisfied with the success of his experiment,\r\nand began on a forecast, which the reader shall follow\r\nfor a few weeks, which he thought, and thought rightly,\r\nwould tend to his own convenience, possibly to that of\r\nhis friends.\r\n\r\nDane telegraphed down to the office that he should be\r\ndetained an hour that morning, went out to his home of\r\nthe day before at Ashmont, paid his landlady her scot,\r\nbrought in with him his little possessions in a valise to\r\nthe office, and did not appear at his new home until\r\nafter nightfall.\r\n\r\nHe was then able to establish himself on the basis\r\nwhich proved convenient afterwards, and which it is worth\r\nwhile to explain to a world which is not too well housed.\r\nThe city had provided three or four chairs there, a\r\nstove, and two tables.  Dane had little literature, but,\r\nas he was in the literary line himself, he did not\r\ncare for this so much; men who write books are not\r\ncommonly eager to read books which are worse than their\r\nown.  At a nine-cent window of a neighboring tinman's he\r\nwas able to buy himself the few little necessities which\r\nhe wanted for housekeeping.  And not to detain the reader\r\ntoo long upon merely fleshly arrangements, in the course\r\nof a couple of hours of Tuesday evening and Wednesday\r\nevening, he had fitted up his convenient if not pretty\r\nbower with all that man requires.  It was easy to buy a\r\nmince pie or a cream cake, or a bit of boiled ham or\r\nroast chicken, according as payday was near or distant.\r\nOne is glad to have a tablecloth.  But if one have a\r\nlarge poster warning people, a year before, that they\r\nshould vote the Prohibition ticket, one's conscience is\r\nnot wounded if this poster, ink down, takes the place\r\nwhich a tablecloth would have taken under other\r\ncircumstances.  If there is not much crockery to use,\r\nthere is but little to wash.  And, in short, as well\r\ntrained a man of the world as Dane had made himself\r\nthoroughly comfortable in his new quarters before the\r\nweek was over.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nAt the beginning Frederick's views were purely\r\npersonal, or, as the preachers say, selfish.  Here was\r\nan empty house, three miles nearer his work than his\r\nhired attic was, and he had taken possession.  But\r\nconscience always asserts itself, and it was not long\r\nbefore he felt that he ought to extend the benefits of\r\nthis new discovery of his somewhat further.  It really\r\nwas a satisfaction to what the pulpits call a \"felt\r\nwant\" when as he came through Massachusetts Avenue on\r\nThursday evening, he met a boy and a girl, neither of\r\nthem more than ten years old, crying on the sidewalk.\r\nDane is sympathetic and fond of children.  He stopped\r\nthe little brats, and satisfied himself that neither\r\nhad had any supper.  He could not understand a word of\r\nthe language in which they spoke, nor could they\r\nunderstand him.  But kindness needs little spoken\r\nlanguage; and accordingly Frederick led them along to\r\nhis cabin, and after waiting, as he always did, a\r\nminute or two, to be sure that no one was in sight, he\r\nunlocked the door, and brought in his little\r\ncompanions.\r\n\r\nIt was clear enough that the children were such waifs\r\nand strays that nothing surprised them, and they readily\r\naccepted the modest hospitalities of the position.  Like\r\nall masculine housekeepers, Frederick had provided three\r\ntimes as much food as he needed for his own physical\r\nwants, so that it was not difficult to make these\r\nchildren happy with the pieces of mince pie and lemon pie\r\nand cream cake and eclairs which were left from his\r\nunknown festivals of the day before.  Poor little things,\r\nthey were both cold and tired, and, before half an hour\r\nwas over, they were snugly asleep on and under a pile of\r\nProhibition posters.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nFortunately for Frederick Dane, for the nine years\r\nbefore he joined Peary, he had lived in the city of\r\nBagdad.  He had there served as the English interpreter\r\nfor the Caliph of that city.  The Caliph did most of\r\nhis business at night, and was in the habit of taking\r\nMr. Dane with him on his evening excursions.  In this\r\nway Mr. Dane had made the somewhat intimate\r\nacquaintance of Mr. Jaffrey, the private secretary of\r\nthe Caliph; and he had indeed in his own employment for\r\nsome time, a wide-awake black man, of the name of\r\nMezrour, who, for his \"other place,\" was engaged as a\r\nservant in the Caliph's household.  Dane was thus not\r\nunfamiliar with the methods of unexpected evening\r\nvisits; and it was fortunate for him that he was so.\r\nThe little children whom he had picked up, explained to\r\nhim, by pantomime which would have made the fortune of\r\na ballet-girl, that they were much more comfortable in\r\ntheir new home than they had been in any other, and\r\nthat they had no wish to leave it.  But by various\r\ntemptations addressed to them, in the form of barley\r\nhorses and dogs, and sticks of barber's candy, Dane,\r\nwho was of a romantic and enterprising disposition,\r\npersuaded them to take him to some of their former\r\nhaunts.\r\n\r\nThese were mostly at the North End of Boston,\r\nand he soon found that he needed all his\r\nrecollections of Bagdad for the purpose of conducting any\r\nconversation with any of the people they knew best.  In\r\na way, however, with a little broken Arabic, a little\r\nbroken Hebrew, a great deal of broken China, and many\r\ngesticulations, he made acquaintance with two of their\r\ncompatriots, who had, as it seemed, crossed the ocean\r\nwith them in the same steerage.  That is to say, they\r\neither had or had not; but for many months Mr. Dane was\r\nunable to discover which.  Such as they were, however,\r\nthey had been sleeping on the outside of the upper attic\r\nof the house in Salutation Alley where these children had\r\nlodged, or not lodged, as the case might be, during the\r\nlast few days.  When Mr. Dane saw what were called their\r\nlodgings, he did not wonder that they had accepted pot-\r\nluck with him.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to explain all this, that the reader\r\nmay understand why, on the first night after the arrival\r\nof these two children, the population of the polling-\r\nbooth was enlarged by the presence of these two Hebrew\r\ncompatriots.  And, without further mystery, it may be as\r\nwell to state that all four were from a village about\r\nnine hundred and twenty-three miles north of Odessa, in\r\nthe southern part of Russia.  They had emigrated in a\r\ncompulsory manner from that province, first on account of\r\nthe utter failure of anything to eat there; second, on\r\naccount of a prejudice which the natives of that country\r\nhad contracted against the Hebrew race.\r\n\r\nThe two North End friends of little Ezra and Sarah\r\nreadily accepted the invitation of the two children to\r\njoin in the College Settlement at the corner of the two\r\navenues.  The rules of the institution proved attractive,\r\nand before a second week was well advanced ten light\r\nexcelsior mattresses were regularly rolled up every\r\nmorning as the different inmates went to their duties;\r\nwhile, as evening closed in, eight cheerful companions\r\ntold stories around the hospitable board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nIt is no part of this little tale to follow, with Mr.\r\nStevenson's magic, or with that of the Arabian Nights,\r\nthe fortunes from day to day of the little circle.\r\nEnough that men of Hebrew race do not prove lazy\r\nanywhere.  Dane, certainly, gave them no bad example.\r\nThe children were at once entered in a neighboring\r\nschool, where they showed the quickness of their race.\r\nThey had the advantage, when the week closed and began,\r\nthat they could attend the Sabbath school provided for\r\nthem by the Hebrews on Saturday and the several Sunday-\r\nschools of the Parker Memorial, the Berkeley Temple,\r\nand the other churches of the neighborhood.  The day\r\nbefore the election, Frederick Dane asked Oleg and\r\nVladimir to help him in bringing up some short boards,\r\nwhich they laid on the trusses in the roof above them.\r\nOn the little attic thus prepared, they stored\r\ntheir mattresses and other personal effects before the\r\ngreat election of that year began.  They had no\r\nintention of interfering, even by a cup of cold coffee,\r\nwith the great wave of righteous indignation which, on\r\nthat particular day of that particular year, \"swept\r\naway, as by a great cosmic tidal flood, the pretences\r\nand ambitions, etc., etc., etc.\"  These words are cited\r\nfrom Frederick Dane's editorial of the next morning, and\r\nwere in fact used by him or by some of his friends,\r\nwithout variations, in all the cosmic changes of the\r\nelections of the next six years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nBut so soon as this election was well over, the country\r\nand the city settled down, with what Ransom used to\r\ncall \"amazin'\" readiness to the new order, such as it\r\nwas.  Only the people who \"take up the streets\"\r\ndetached more men than ever to spoil the pavement.  For\r\nnow a city election was approaching.  And it might be\r\nthat the pavers and ditchers and shovellers and\r\ncurbstone men and asphalt makers should vote wrong.\r\nDane and his settlement were well aware that after this\r\nelection they would all have to move out from their\r\ncomfortable quarters.  But, while they were in, they\r\ndetermined to prepare for a fit Thanksgiving to God,\r\nand the country which makes provision so generous for\r\nthose in need.  It is not every country, indeed,\r\nwhich provides four hundred empty houses, every autumn,\r\nfor the convenience of any unlodged night-editor with a\r\nskeleton key, who comes along.\r\n\r\nHe explained to his companions that a great festival\r\nwas near.  They heard this with joy.  He explained that\r\nno work would be done that day,--not in any cigar-shop or\r\nsweating-room.  This also pleased them.  He then, at some\r\nlength, explained the necessity of the sacrifice of\r\nturkeys on the occasion.  He told briefly how Josselyn\r\nand the fathers shot them as they passed through the sky.\r\nBut he explained that now we shoot them, as one makes\r\nmoney, not directly but indirectly.  We shoot our\r\nturkeys, say, at shooting-galleries.  All this proved\r\nintelligible, and Frederick had no fear for turkeys.\r\n\r\nAs for Sarah and Ezra, he found that at Ezra's boys'\r\nclub and at Sarah's girls' club, and each of her Sabbath-\r\nschool classes and Sunday-school classes, and at each of\r\nhis, it had been explained that on the day before\r\nThanksgiving they must come with baskets to places named,\r\nand carry home a Thanksgiving dinner.\r\n\r\nThese announcements were hailed with satisfaction by\r\nall to whom Dane addressed them.  Everything in the\r\ncountry was as strange to them as it would have been to\r\nan old friend of mine, an inhabitant of the planet Mars.\r\nAnd they accepted the custom of this holiday among the\r\nrest.  Oddly enough, it proved that one or two of them\r\nwere first-rate shots, and, by attendance at\r\ndifferent shooting-galleries, they brought in more than\r\na turkey apiece, as Governor Bradford's men did in 1621.\r\nMany of them were at work in large factories, where it\r\nwas the custom of the house to give a roasted turkey and\r\na pan of cranberry sauce to each person who had been on\r\nthe pay-list for three months.  One or two of them were\r\nerrand men in the market, and it was the practice of the\r\nwholesale dealers there, who at this season become to a\r\ncertain extent retailers, to encourage these errand men\r\nby presenting to each of them a turkey, which was\r\npromised in advance.  As for Dane himself, the\r\nproprietors of his journal always presented a turkey to\r\neach man on their staff.  And in looking forward to his\r\nThanksgiving at the polls, he had expected to provide a\r\ntwenty-two pound gobbler which a friend in Vermont was\r\nkeeping for him.  It may readily be imagined, then, that,\r\nwhen the day before Thanksgiving came, he was more\r\noppressed by an embarrassment of riches than by any\r\ndifficulty on the debtor side of his account.  He had\r\ntwelve people to feed, himself included.  There were the\r\ntwo children, their eight friends, and a young Frenchman\r\nfrom Paris who, like all persons of that nationality who\r\nare six months in this country, had found many enemies\r\nhere.  Dane had invited him to dinner.  He had arranged\r\nthat there should be plates or saucers enough for each\r\nperson to have two.  And now there was to be a chicken-\r\npie from Obed Shalom, some mince pies and\r\nMarlborough pies from the Union for Christian Work, a\r\nturkey at each end of the board; and he found he should\r\nhave left over, after the largest computation for the\r\nappetites of the visitors, twenty-three pies of different\r\nstructure, five dishes of cranberry sauce, three or four\r\nboxes of raisins, two or three drums of figs, two roasted\r\ngeese and eleven turkeys.  He counted all the turkeys as\r\nroasted, because he had the promise of the keeper of the\r\nMontgomery House that he would roast for him all the\r\nbirds that were brought in to him before nine o'clock on\r\nThanksgiving morning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nHaving stated all this on a list carefully written,\r\nfirst in the English language and second in the\r\nlanguage of the Hebrews, Frederick called his fellow-\r\nlodgers together earlier than usual on the evening\r\nbefore Thanksgiving Day.  He explained to them, in the\r\npatois which they used together, that it would be\r\nindecent for them to carry this supply of food farther\r\nthan next Monday for their own purposes.  He told them\r\nthat the occasion was one of exuberant thanksgiving to\r\nthe God of heaven.  He showed them that they all had\r\ngreat reason for thanksgiving.  And, in short, he made\r\nthree heads of a discourse which might have been\r\nexpanded by the most eloquent preacher in Boston\r\nthe next day, and would have well covered the twenty-\r\nfive minutes which the regulation would have required\r\nfor a sermon.  He then said that, as they had been\r\nfavored with much more than they could use for their own\r\nappetites, they must look up those who were not so well\r\noff as themselves.\r\n\r\nHe was well pleased by finding that he was\r\nunderstood, and what he said was received with applause\r\nin the various forms in which Southern Russia applauds on\r\nsuch occasions.  As for the two children, their eyes were\r\nwide open, and their mouths, and they looked their\r\nwonder.\r\n\r\nFrederick then proposed that two of their number\r\nshould volunteer to open a rival establishment at the\r\npolling-booth at the corner of Gates Street and Burgoyne\r\nStreet, and that the company should on the next day\r\ninvite guests enough to make another table of twelve.  He\r\nproposed that the same course should be taken at the\r\ncorner of Shapleigh and Bowditch Streets, and yet again\r\nat the booth which is at the corner of Curtis Avenue and\r\nQuincy Street.  And he said that, as time would press\r\nupon them, they had better arrange to carry a part at\r\nleast of the stores to these places that evening.  To\r\nthis there was a general assent.  The company sat down to\r\na hasty tea, administered much as the Israelites took\r\ntheir last meal in Egypt; for every man had on his long\r\nfrieze coat and his heavy boots, and they were eager for\r\nthe active work of Thanksgiving.  For each the\r\nstewards packed two turkeys in a basket, filled in\r\nas far as they could with other stores, and Frederick\r\nheaded his procession.\r\n\r\nIt was then that he was to learn, for the first time,\r\nthat he was not the only person in Boston.\r\n\r\nIt was then that he found out that the revelation\r\nmade to one man is frequently made to many.\r\n\r\nHe found out that he was as wise as the next fellow,\r\nbut was no wiser; was as good as the next fellow, but was\r\nno better; and that, in short, he had no special patent\r\nupon his own undertaking,\r\n\r\nThe little procession soon arrived at the corner of\r\nShapleigh and Bowditch Streets.  Whoever had made the\r\nlocks on the doors of the houses had been content to use\r\nthe same pattern for all. It proved, therefore, that the\r\nkey of No. 237 answered for No. 238, and it was not\r\nnecessary to open the door with the \"Jimmy\" which Simeon\r\nhad under his ulster.\r\n\r\nBut on the other hand, to Frederick's amazement, as\r\nhe threw the door open, he found a lighted room and a\r\nlong table around which sat twelve men, guised or\r\ndisguised in much the same way as those whom he had\r\nbrought with him.  A few moments showed that another\r\nleader of the people had discovered this vacant home a\r\nfew weeks before, and had established there another\r\nsettlement of the un-homed.  As it proved, this gentleman\r\nwas a Mashpee Indian.  He was, in fact, the member of the\r\nHouse of Representatives from the town of Mashpee for the\r\nnext winter.  Arriving in Boston to look for\r\nlodgings, he, not unnaturally, met with a Mohawk, two\r\nDacotahs, and a Cherokee, who, for various errands, had\r\ncome north and east.  A similarity of color, not to say\r\nof racial relations, had established a warm friendship\r\namong the five, and they had brought together gradually\r\ntwelve gentlemen of copper color, who had been residing\r\nin this polling-booth since the second day after the\r\ngeneral election.  Their fortune had not been unlike that\r\nof Frederick and his friends, and at this moment they\r\nwere discussing the methods by which they might\r\ndistribute several brace of ducks which had been sent up\r\nfrom Mashpee, a haunch of venison which had come down\r\nfrom above Machias, and some wild turkeys which had\r\narrived by express from the St. Regis Indians of Northern\r\nNew York.  At the moment of the arrival of our friends,\r\nthey were sending out two of their number to find how\r\nthey might best distribute thus their extra provender.\r\n\r\nThese two gladly joined in the little procession, and\r\nall went together to the corner of Quincy Street and\r\nCurtis Avenue.  There a similar revelation was made, only\r\nthere was some difficulty at first in any real mutual\r\nunderstanding.  For here they met a dozen, more or less,\r\nof French Canadians.  These gentlemen had left their\r\nwives and their children in the province of Quebec, and,\r\nfinding themselves in Boston, had taken possession of the\r\npolling-booth, where they were living much more\r\ncomfortably than they would have lived at home.\r\nThey too had been well provided for Thanksgiving, both by\r\ntheir friends at home and by their employers, and had\r\nbeen questioning as to the distribution which they could\r\nmake of their supplies.  Reinforced by four of their\r\nnumber, the delegation in search of hungry people was\r\nincreased to fourteen in number, and with a certain\r\ncuriosity, it must be confessed, they went together to\r\ntry their respective keys on No. 311.\r\n\r\nOpening this without so much as knocking at the door\r\nto know if here they might not provide the \"annex\" or\r\n\"tender\" which they wished to establish, they found, it\r\nmust be confessed without any amazement or amusement, a\r\ncompany of Italians under the charge of one Antonio Fero,\r\nwho had also worked out the problem of cheap lodgings,\r\nand had established themselves for some weeks here.\r\nThese men also had been touched, either by some priest's\r\nvoice or other divine word, with a sense of the duties of\r\nthe occasion, and were just looking round to know where\r\nthey might spread their second table.  Five of them\r\njoined the fourteen, and the whole company, after a rapid\r\nconversation, agreed that they would try No. 277 on the\r\nother side of the Avenue.  And here their fortunes\r\nchanged.\r\n\r\nFor here it proved that the \"cops\" on that beat,\r\nfinding nights growing somewhat cold, and that there was\r\nno provision made by the police commissioners for a club-\r\nroom for gentlemen of their profession, had themselves\r\narranged in the polling-booth a convenient place for\r\nthe reading of the evening newspapers and for conference\r\non their mutual affairs.  These \"cops\" were unmarried\r\nmen, and did not much know where was the home in which\r\nthe governor requested them to spend their Thanksgiving.\r\nThey had therefore determined to spread their own table\r\nin their club-room, and this evening had been making\r\npreparations for a picnic feast there at midnight on\r\nThanksgiving Day, when they should be relieved from their\r\nmore pressing duties.  They also had found the liberality\r\nof each member of the force had brought in more than\r\nwould be requisite, and were considering the same subject\r\nwhich had oppressed the consciences of the leaders of the\r\nother bands.\r\n\r\nNo one ever knew who made the great suggestion, but\r\nit is probable that it was one of these officials, well\r\nacquainted with the charter of the city of Boston and\r\nwith its constitution and by-laws, who offered the\r\nproposal which was adopted.  In the jealousy of the\r\nfierce democracy of Boston in the year 1820, when the\r\npresent city charter was made, it reserved for itself\r\npermission to open Faneuil Hall at any time for a public\r\nmeeting.  It proves now that whenever fifty citizens\r\nunite to ask for the use of the hall for such a meeting,\r\nit must be given to them.  At the time of which we are\r\nreading the mayor had to preside at every such meeting.\r\nAt the \"Cops'\" club it was highly determined that the\r\nnames of fifty citizens should at once be obtained,\r\nand that the Cradle of Liberty should be secured for the\r\ngeneral Thanksgiving.\r\n\r\nIt was wisely resolved that no public notice should\r\nbe given of this in the journals.  It was well known that\r\nthat many-eyed Argus called the press is very apt not to\r\ninterfere with that which is none of its business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nAnd thus it happened that, when Thanksgiving Day came,\r\nthe worthy janitor of Faneuil Hall sent down his\r\nassistant to open it, and that the assistant, who meant\r\nto dine at home, found a good-natured friend from the\r\ncountry who took the keys and lighted the gas in his\r\nplace.  Before the sun had set, Frederick Dane and\r\nAntonio Fero and Michael Chevalier and the Honorable\r\nMr. Walk-in-the-Water and Eben Kartschoff arrived with\r\nan express-wagon driven by a stepson of P. Nolan.\r\nThere is no difficulty at Faneuil Hall in bringing out\r\na few trestles and as many boards as one wants for\r\ntables, for Faneuil Hall is a place given to\r\nhospitality.  And so, before six o'clock, the hour\r\nassigned for the extemporized dinner, the tables were\r\nset with turkeys, with geese, with venison, with mallards\r\nand plover, with quail and partridges, with cranberry and\r\nsquash, and with dishes of Russia and Italy and Greece\r\nand Bohemia, such as have no names.  The Greeks brought\r\nfruits, the Indians brought venison, the Italians\r\nbrought red wine, the French brought walnuts and\r\nchestnuts, and the good God sent a blessing.  Almost\r\nevery man found up either a wife or a sweetheart or a\r\ndaughter or a niece to come with him, and the feast went\r\non to the small hours of Friday.  The Mayor came down on\r\ntime, and being an accomplished man, addressed them in\r\nEnglish, in Latin, in Greek, in Hebrew, and in Tuscan.\r\nAnd it is to be hoped that they understood him.\r\n\r\nBut no record has ever been made of the feast in any\r\naccount-book on this side the line.  Yet there are those\r\nwho have seen it, or something like it, with the eye of\r\nfaith.  And when, a hundred years hence, some antiquary\r\nreads this story in a number of the \"Omaha\r\nIntelligencer,\" which has escaped the detrition of the\r\nthirty-six thousand days and nights, he will say,--\r\n\r\n\"Why, this was the beginning of what we do now!  Only\r\nthese people seem to have taken care of strangers only\r\none month in the twelve.  Why did they not welcome all\r\nstrangers in like manner, until they had made them feel\r\nat home?  These people, once a year, seem to have fed the\r\nhungry.  Would it not have been simpler for them to\r\nprovide that no man should ever be hungry?  These people\r\ncertainly thanked God to some purpose once a year; how\r\nhappy is the nation which has learned to thank Him always!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SURVIVOR'S STORY\r\n\r\nFortunately we were with our wives.\r\n\r\nIt is in general an excellent custom, as I will\r\nexplain if opportunity is given.\r\n\r\nFirst, you are thus sure of good company.\r\n\r\nFor four mortal hours we had ground along, and\r\nstopped and waited and started again, in the drifts\r\nbetween Westfield and Springfield.  We had shrieked out\r\nour woes by the voices of five engines.  Brave men had\r\ndug.  Patient men had sat inside and waited for the\r\nresults of the digging.  At last, in triumph, at eleven\r\nand three quarters, as they say in \"Cinderella,\" we\r\nentered the Springfield station.\r\n\r\nIt was Christmas Eve!\r\n\r\nLeaving the train to its devices, Blatchford and his\r\nwife (her name was Sarah), and I with mine (her name was\r\nPhebe), walked quickly with our little sacks out of the\r\nstation, ploughed and waded along the white street, not\r\nto the Massasoit--no, but to the old Eagle and Star,\r\nwhich was still standing, and was a favorite with us\r\nyoungsters.  Good waffles, maple syrup ad lib., such\r\nfixings of other sorts as we preferred, and some liberty.\r\nThe amount of liberty in absolutely first-class\r\nhotels is but small.  A drowsy boy waked, and turned up\r\nthe gas.  Blatchford entered our names on the register,\r\nand cried at once, \"By George, Wolfgang is here, and\r\nDick!  What luck!\" for Dick and Wolfgang also travel with\r\ntheir wives.  The boy explained that they had come up the\r\nriver in the New Haven train, were only nine hours behind\r\ntime, had arrived at ten, and had just finished supper\r\nand gone to bed.  We ordered rare beefsteak, waffles,\r\ndip-toast, omelettes with kidneys, and omelettes without;\r\nwe toasted our feet at the open fire in the parlor; we\r\nate the supper when it was ready; and we also went to\r\nbed; rejoicing that we had home with us, having travelled\r\nwith our wives; and that we could keep our Merry\r\nChristmas here.  If only Wolfgang and Dick and their\r\nwives would join us, all would be well.  (Wolfgang's wife\r\nwas named Bertha, and Dick's was named Hosanna,--a name\r\nI have never met with elsewhere.)\r\n\r\nBed followed; and I am a graceless dog that I do not\r\nwrite a sonnet here on the unbroken slumber that\r\nfollowed.  Breakfast, by arrangement of us four, at nine.\r\nAt 9.30, to us enter Bertha, Dick, Hosanna, and Wolfgang,\r\nto name them in alphabetical order.  Four chairs had been\r\nturned down for them.  Four chops, four omelettes, and\r\nfour small oval dishes of fried potatoes had been\r\nordered, and now appeared.  Immense shouting, immense\r\nkissing among those who had that privilege, general\r\nwondering, and great congratulating that our wives were\r\nthere.  Solid resolution that we would advance no\r\nfarther.  Here, and here only, in Springfield itself,\r\nwould we celebrate our Christmas Day.\r\n\r\nIt may be remarked in parenthesis that we had learned\r\nalready that no train had entered the town since eleven\r\nand a quarter; and it was known by telegraph that none\r\nwas within thirty-four miles and a half of the spot, at\r\nthe moment the vow was made.\r\n\r\nWe waded and ploughed our way through the snow to\r\nchurch.  I think Mr. Rumfry, if that is the gentleman's\r\nname who preached an admirable Christmas sermon in a\r\nbeautiful church there, will remember the platoon of four\r\nmen and four women who made perhaps a fifth of his\r\ncongregation in that storm,--a storm which shut off most\r\nchurch-going.  Home again: a jolly fire in the parlor,\r\ndry stockings, and dry slippers.  Turkeys, and all things\r\nfitting for the dinner; and then a general assembly, not\r\nin a caravansary, not in a coffee-room, but in the\r\nregular guests' parlor of a New England second-class\r\nhotel, where, as it was ordered, there were no\r\n\"transients\" but ourselves that day; and whence all the\r\n\"boarders\" had gone either to their own rooms or to other\r\nhomes.\r\n\r\nFor people who have their wives with them, it is not\r\ndifficult to provide entertainment on such an occasion.\r\n\r\n\"Bertha,\" said Wolfgang, \"could you not entertain us\r\nwith one of your native dances?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ho! slave,\" said Dick to Hosanna, \"play upon the\r\nvirginals.\"  And Hosanna played a lively Arab air on the\r\ntavern piano, while the fair Bertha danced with a spirit\r\nunusual.  Was it indeed in memory of the Christmas of her\r\nown dear home in Circassia?\r\n\r\nAll that, from \"Bertha\" to \"Circassia,\" is not so.\r\nWe did not do this at all.  That was all a slip of the\r\npen.  What we did was this.  John Blatchford pulled the\r\nbell-cord till it broke (they always break in novels, and\r\nsometimes they do in taverns).  This bell-cord broke.\r\nThe sleepy boy came; and John said, \"Caitiff, is there\r\nnever a barber in the house?\"  The frightened boy said\r\nthere was; and John bade him send him.  In a minute the\r\nbarber appeared--black, as was expected--with a shining\r\nface, and white teeth, and in shirt-sleeves, and broad\r\ninquiry.\r\n\r\n\"Do you tell me, Caesar,\" said John, \"that in your\r\ncountry they do not wear their coats on Christmas Day?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sartin, they do, sah, when they go outdoors.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you tell me, Caesar,\" said Dick, \"that they have\r\ndoors in your country?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sartin, they do,\" said poor Caesar, flurried.\r\n\r\n\"Boy,\" said I, \"the gentlemen are making fun of you.\r\nThey want to know if you ever keep Christmas in your\r\ncountry without a dance.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never, sah,\" said poor Caesar.\r\n\r\n\"Do they dance without music?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sah; never.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go, then,\" I said, in my sternest accents,--\"go\r\nfetch a zithern, or a banjo, or a kit, or a hurdy-gurdy,\r\nor a fiddle.\"\r\n\r\nThe black boy went, and returned with his violin.\r\nAnd as the light grew gray, and crept into the darkness,\r\nand as the darkness gathered more thick and more, he\r\nplayed for us, and he played for us, tune after tune; and\r\nwe danced--first with precision, then in sport, then in\r\nwild holiday frenzy.  We began with waltzes--so great is\r\nthe convenience of travelling with your wives--where\r\nshould we have been, had we been all sole alone, four\r\nmen?  Probably playing whist or euchre.  And now we began\r\nwith waltzes, which passed into polkas, which subsided\r\ninto other round dances; and then in very exhaustion we\r\nfell back in a grave quadrille.  I danced with Hosanna;\r\nWolfgang and Sarah were our vis-a-vis.  We went\r\nthrough the same set that Noah and his three boys danced\r\nin the ark with their four wives, and which has been\r\ndanced ever since, in every moment, on one or another\r\nspot of the dry earth, going round it with the sun, like\r\nthe drum-beat of England--right and left, first two\r\nforward, right hand across, pastorale--the whole\r\nseries of them; we did them with as much spirit as if it\r\nhad been on a flat on the side of Ararat, ground yet too\r\nmuddy for croquet.  Then Blatchford called for\r\n\"Virginia Reel,\" and we raced and chased through that.\r\nPoor Caesar began to get exhausted, but a little flip\r\nfrom downstairs helped him amazingly.  And after the flip\r\nDick cried, \"Can you not dance `Money-Musk'?\"  And in one\r\nwild frenzy of delight we danced \"Money-Musk\" and \"Hull's\r\nVictory\" and \"Dusty Miller\" and \"Youth's Companion,\" and\r\n\"Irish jigs\" on the closet-door lifted off for the\r\noccasion, till the men lay on the floor screaming with\r\nthe fun, and the women fell back on the sofas, fairly\r\nfaint with laughing.\r\n\r\nAll this last, since the sentence after \"Circassia,\"\r\nis a mistake.  There was not any bell, nor any barber,\r\nand we did not dance at all.  This was all a slip of my\r\nmemory.\r\n\r\nWhat we really did was this:\r\n\r\nJohn Blatchford said, \"Let us all tell stories.\"  It\r\nwas growing dark and he put more logs on the fire.\r\n\r\nBertha said,--\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Heap on more wood, the wind is chill;\r\nBut let it whistle as it will,\r\nWe'll keep our merry Christmas still.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nShe said that because it was in \"Bertha's Visit,\"--a\r\nvery stupid book, which she remembered.\r\n\r\nThen Wolfgang told\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PENNY-A-LINER'S STORY\r\n\r\n[Wolfgang is a reporter, or was then, on the staff of\r\nthe \"Star.\"]\r\n\r\nWhen I was on the \"Tribune\" [he never was on the\r\n\"Tribune\" an hour, unless he calls selling the \"Tribune\"\r\nat Fort Plains being on the \"Tribune.\"  But I tell the\r\nstory as he told it.  He said:]  When I was on the\r\n\"Tribune,\" I was despatched to report Mr. Webster's great\r\nreply to Hayne.  This was in the days of stages.  We had\r\nto ride from Baltimore to Washington early in the morning\r\nto get there in time.  I found my boots were gone from my\r\nroom when the stage-man called me, and I reported that\r\nspeech in worsted slippers my wife had given me the week\r\nbefore.  As we came into Bladensburg, it grew light, and\r\nI recognized my boots on the feet of my fellow-\r\npassenger,--there was but one other man in the stage.  I\r\nturned to claim them, but stopped in a moment, for it was\r\nWebster himself.  How serene his face looked as he slept\r\nthere!  He woke soon, passed the time of day, offered me\r\na part of a sandwich, for we were old friends,--I was\r\ncounsel against him in the Ogden case.  Said Webster to\r\nme, \"Steele, I am bothered about this speech; I have a\r\nparagraph in it which I cannot word up to my mind;\" and\r\nhe repeated it to me.  \"How would this do?\" said he.\r\n\"`Let us hope that the sense of unrestricted freedom may\r\nbe so intertwined with the desire to preserve a\r\nconnection of the several parts of the body politic, that\r\nsome arrangement, more or less lasting, may prove in a\r\nmeasure satisfactory.'  How would that do?\"\r\n\r\nI said I liked the idea, but the expression seemed\r\ninvolved.\r\n\r\n\"And it is involved,\" said Webster; \"but I can't\r\nimprove it.\"\r\n\r\n\"How would this do?\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"`LIBERTY AND UNION, NOW AND FOREVER, ONE AND\r\nINSEPARABLE!'\"\r\n\r\n\"Capital!\" he said, \"capital! write that down for\r\nme.\"  At that moment we arrived at the Capitol steps.  I\r\nwrote down the words for him, and from my notes he read\r\nthem, when that place in the speech came along.\r\n\r\nAll of us applauded the story.\r\n\r\nPhebe then told\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SCHOOLMISTRESS'S STORY\r\n\r\nYou remind me of the impression that very speech made\r\non me, as I heard Henry Chapin deliver it at an\r\nexhibition at Leicester Academy.  I resolved then that I\r\nwould free the slave, or perish in the attempt.  But how?\r\nI, a woman--disfranchised by the law?  Ha!  I saw!\r\n\r\nI went to Arkansas.  I opened a \"Normal College, or\r\nAcademy for Teachers.\"  We had balls every second\r\nnight, to make it popular.  Immense numbers came.  Half\r\nthe teachers of the  Southern States were trained there.\r\nI had admirable instructors in oil painting and music--\r\nthe most essential studies.  The arithmetic I taught\r\nmyself.  I taught it well.  I achieved fame.  I achieved\r\nwealth; invested in Arkansas five per cents.  Only one\r\nsecret device I persevered in.  To all--old and young,\r\ninnocent girls and sturdy men--I so taught the\r\nmultiplication table that one fatal error was hidden in\r\nits array of facts.  The nine line is the difficult one.\r\nI buried the error there.  \"Nine times six,\" I taught\r\nthem, \"is fifty-six.\"  The rhyme made it easy.  The\r\ngilded falsehood passed from lip to lip, from State to\r\nState,--one little speck in a chain of golden verity.  I\r\nretired from teaching.  Slowly I watched the growth of\r\nthe rebellion.  At last the aloe blossom shot up--after\r\nits hundred years of waiting.  The Southern heart was\r\nfired.  I brooded over my revenge.  I repaired to\r\nRichmond.  I opened a first-class boarding-house, where\r\nall the Cabinet and most of the Senate came for their\r\nmeals; and I had eight permanents.  Soon their brows\r\nclouded.  The first flush of victory passed away.  Night\r\nafter night they sat over their calculations, which all\r\ncame wrong.  I smiled--and was a villain!  None of their\r\nsums would prove.  None of their estimates matched the\r\nperformance!  Never a muster-roll that fitted as it\r\nshould do!  And I--the despised boarding-mistress--I\r\nalone knew why!  Often and often, when Memminger has\r\nsaid to me, with an oath, \"Why this discordancy in our\r\ntotals?\" have my lips burned to tell the secret!  But no!\r\nI hid it in my bosom.  And when at last I saw a black\r\nregiment march into Richmond, singing \"John Brown,\" I\r\ncried, for the first time in twenty years, \"Six times\r\nnine is fifty-four,\" and gloated in my sweet revenge.\r\n\r\nThen was hushed the harp of Phebe, and Dick told his story.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE INSPECTOR OF GAS-METERS' STORY\r\n\r\nMine is a tale of the ingratitude of republics.  It\r\nis well-nigh thirty years since I was walking by the\r\nOwego and Ithaca Railroad,--a crooked road, not then\r\nadapted to high speed.  Of a sudden I saw that a long\r\ncross timber, on a trestle, high above a swamp, had\r\nsprung up from its ties.  I looked for a spike with which\r\nto secure it.  I  found a stone with which to hammer the\r\nspike.  But at this moment a train approached, down hill.\r\nI screamed.  They heard!  But the engine had no power to\r\nstop the heavy train.  With the presence of mind of a\r\npoet, and the courage of a hero, I flung my own weight on\r\nthe fatal timber.  I would hold it down, or perish.  The\r\nengine came.  The elasticity of the pine timber whirled\r\nme in the air!  But I held on.  The tender crossed.\r\nAgain I was flung in wild gyrations.  But I held on.\r\n\"It is no bed of roses,\" I said; \"but what act of\r\nParliament was there that I should be happy?\"  Three\r\npassenger cars and ten freight cars, as was then the\r\nvicious custom of that road, passed me.  But I held on,\r\nrepeating to myself texts of Scripture to give me\r\ncourage.  As the last car passed, I was whirled into the\r\nair by the rebound of the rafter.  \"Heavens!\" I said, \"if\r\nmy orbit is a hyperbola, I shall never return to earth.\"\r\nHastily I estimated its ordinates, and calculated the\r\ncurve.  What bliss!  It was a parabola!  After a flight\r\nof a hundred and seventeen cubits, I landed, head down,\r\nin a soft mud-hole!\r\n\r\nIn that train was the young U. S. Grant, on his way\r\nto West Point for examination.  But for me the armies of\r\nthe Republic would have had no leader.\r\n\r\nI pressed my claim, when I asked to be appointed\r\nMinister to England.  Although no one else wished to go,\r\nI alone was forgotten.  Such is gratitude with republics!\r\n\r\nHe ceased.  Then Sarah Blatchford told\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WHEELER AND WILSON'S OPERATIVE'S STORY\r\n\r\nMy father had left the anchorage of Sorrento for a\r\nshort voyage, if voyage it may be called.  Life was\r\nyoung, and this world seemed heaven.  The yacht bowled on\r\nunder tight-reefed staysails, and all was happy.\r\nSuddenly the corsairs seized us; all were slain in my\r\ndefence; but I--this fatal gift of beauty bade them spare\r\nmy life!\r\n\r\nWhy linger on my tale?  In the Zenana of the Shah of\r\nPersia I found my home.  \"How escape his eye?\" I said;\r\nand, fortunately, I remembered that in my reticule I\r\ncarried one box of F. Kidder's indelible ink.  Instantly\r\nI applied the liquid in the large bottle to one cheek.\r\nSoon as it was dry, I applied that in the small bottle,\r\nand sat in the sun one hour.  My head ached with the\r\nsunlight, but what of that?  I was a fright, and I knew\r\nall would be well.\r\n\r\nI was consigned, so soon as my hideous deficiencies\r\nwere known, to the sewing-room.  Then how I sighed for my\r\nmachine!  Alas! it was not there; but I constructed an\r\nimitation from a cannon-wheel, a coffee-mill, and two\r\nnut-crackers.  And with this I made the underclothing for\r\nthe palace and the Zenana.\r\n\r\nI also vowed revenge.  Nor did I doubt one instant\r\nhow; for in my youth I had read Lucretia Borgia's\r\nmemoirs, and I had a certain rule for slowly slaying a\r\ntyrant at a distance.  I was in charge of the Shah's own\r\nlinen.  Every week I set back the buttons on his shirt\r\ncollars by the width of one thread; or, by arts known to\r\nme, I shrunk the binding of the collar by a like\r\nproportion.  Tighter and tighter with each week did the\r\nvice close around his larynx.  Week by week, at the\r\nhigh religious festivals, I could see his face was\r\nblacker and blacker.  At length the hated tyrant died.\r\nThe leeches called it apoplexy.  I did not undeceive\r\nthem.  His guards sacked the palace.  I bagged the\r\ndiamonds, fled with them to Trebizond, and sailed thence\r\nin a caique to South Boston.  No more! such memories\r\noppress me.\r\n\r\nHer voice was hushed.  I told my tale in turn.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CONDUCTOR'S STORY\r\n\r\nI was poor.  Let this be my excuse, or rather my\r\napology.  I entered a Third Avenue car at Thirty-sixth\r\nStreet, and saw the conductor sleeping.  Satan tempted\r\nme, and I took from him his badge, 213.  I see the hated\r\nfigures now.  When he woke, he knew not he had lost it.\r\nThe car started, and he walked to the rear.  With the\r\nbadge on my coat I collected eight fares within, stepped\r\nforward, and sprang into the street.  Poverty is my only\r\napology for the crime.  I concealed myself in a cellar\r\nwhere men were playing with props.  Fear is my only\r\nexcuse.  Lest they should suspect me, I joined their\r\ngame, and my forty cents were soon three dollars and\r\nseventy.  With these ill-gotten gains I visited the gold\r\nexchange, then open evenings.  My superior intelligence\r\nenabled me to place well my modest means, and at\r\nmidnight I had a competence.  Let me be a warning to all\r\nyoung men.  Since that night I have never gambled more.\r\n\r\nI threw the hated badge into the river.  I bought a\r\npalace on Murray Hill, and led an upright and honorable\r\nlife.  But since that night of terror the sound of the\r\nhorse-cars oppresses me.  Always since, to go up town or\r\ndown, I order my own coupe, with George to drive me; and\r\nnever have I entered the cleanly, sweet, and airy\r\ncarriage provided for the public.  I cannot; conscience\r\nis too much for me.  You see in me a monument of crime.\r\n\r\nI said no more.  A moment's pause, a few natural\r\ntears, and a single sigh hushed the assembly; then\r\nBertha, with her siren voice, told\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WIFE OF BIDDEFORD'S STORY\r\n\r\nAt the time you speak of I was the private governess\r\nof two lovely boys, Julius and Pompey--Pompey the senior\r\nof the two.  The black-eyed darling!  I see him now.  I\r\nalso see, hanging to his neck, his blue-eyed brother, who\r\nhad given Pompey his black eye the day before.  Pompey\r\nwas generous to a fault; Julius parsimonious beyond\r\nvirtue.  I, therefore, instructed them in two different\r\nrooms.  To Pompey I read the story of \"Waste not, want\r\nnot.\"  To Julius, on the other hand, I spoke of the\r\nAll-love of his great Mother Nature, and her profuse\r\ngifts to her children.  Leaving him with grapes and\r\noranges, I stepped back to Pompey, and taught him how to\r\nuntie parcels so as to save the string.  Leaving him\r\nwinding the string neatly, I went back to Julius, and\r\ngave him ginger-cakes.  The dear boys grew from year to\r\nyear.  They outgrew their knickerbockers, and had\r\ntrousers.  They outgrew their jackets, and became men;\r\nand I felt that I had not lived in vain.  I had conquered\r\nnature.  Pompey, the little spendthrift, was the honored\r\ncashier of a savings-bank, till he ran away with the\r\ncapital.  Julius, the miser, became the chief croupier at\r\nthe New Crockford's.  One of those boys is now in Botany\r\nBay, and the other is in Sierra Leone!\r\n\r\n\"I thought you were going to say in a hotter place,\"\r\nsaid John Blatchford; and he told his story.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STOKER'S STORY\r\n\r\nWe were crossing the Atlantic in a Cunarder.  I was\r\nsecond stoker on the starboard watch.  In that horrible\r\ngale we spoke of before dinner, the coal was exhausted,\r\nand I, as the best-dressed man, was sent up to the\r\ncaptain to ask him what we should do.  I found him\r\nhimself at the wheel.  He almost cursed me, and bade me\r\nsay nothing of coal, at a moment when he must keep\r\nher head to the wind with her full power, or we were\r\nlost.  He bade me slide my hand into his pocket, and take\r\nout the key of the after freight-room, open that, and use\r\nthe contents for fuel.  I returned hastily to the engine-\r\nroom, and we did as we were bid.  The room contained\r\nnothing but old account books, which made a hot and\r\neffective fire.\r\n\r\nOn the third day the captain came down himself into\r\nthe engine-room, where I had never seen him before,\r\ncalled me aside, and told me that by mistake he had given\r\nme the wrong key; asking me if I had used it.  I pointed\r\nto him the empty room; not a leaf was left.  He turned\r\npale with fright.  As I saw his emotion, he confided to\r\nme the truth.  The books were the evidences or accounts\r\nof the British national debt; of what is familiarly known\r\nas the Consolidated Fund, or the \"Consols.\"  They had\r\nbeen secretly sent to New York for the examination of\r\nJames Fiske, who had been asked to advance a few millions\r\non this security to the English Exchequer, and now all\r\nevidence of indebtedness was gone!\r\n\r\nThe captain was about to leap into the sea.  But I\r\ndissuaded him.  I told him to say nothing; I would keep\r\nhis secret; no man else knew it.  The government would\r\nnever utter it.  It was safe in our hands.  He\r\nreconsidered his purpose.  We came safe to port and did--\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\nOnly on the first quarter-day which followed, I\r\nobtained leave of absence, and visited the Bank of\r\nEngland, to see what happened.  At the door was this\r\nplacard, \"Applicants for dividends will file a written\r\napplication, with name and amount, at desk A, and proceed\r\nin turn to the Paying Teller's Office.\"  I saw their\r\ningenuity.  They were making out new books, certain that\r\nnone would apply but those who were accustomed to.  So\r\nskilfully do men of government study human nature.\r\n\r\nI stepped lightly to one of the public desks.  I took\r\none of the blanks.  I filled it out, \"John Blatchford,\r\nL1747 6s. 8d.\" and handed it in at the open trap.  I\r\ntook my place in the queue in the teller's room.  After\r\nan agreeable hour, a pile, not thick, of Bank of England\r\nnotes was given to me; and since that day I have\r\nquarterly drawn that amount from the maternal government\r\nof that country.  As I left the teller's room, I observed\r\nthe captain in the queue.  He was the seventh man from\r\nthe window, and I have never seen him more.\r\n\r\nWe then asked Hosanna for her story.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE N. E. HISTORICAL GENEALOGIST'S STORY\r\n\r\n\"My story,\" said she, \"will take us far back into the\r\npast.  It will be necessary for me to dwell on some\r\nincidents in the first settlement of this country, and I\r\npropose that we first prepare and enjoy the Christmas\r\ntree.  After this, if your courage holds, you shall hear\r\nan over-true tale.\"  Pretty creature, how little she\r\nknew what was before us!\r\n\r\nAs we had sat listening to the stories, we had been\r\npreparing for the tree.  Shopping being out of the\r\nquestion, we were fain from our own stores to make up our\r\npresents, while the women were arranging nuts, and blown\r\negg-shells, and popcorn strings from the stores of the\r\nEagle and Star.  The popping of corn in two corn-poppers\r\nhad gone on through the whole of the story-telling.  All\r\nbeing so nearly ready, I called the drowsy boy again,\r\nand, showing him a very large stick in the wood-box,\r\nasked him to bring me a hatchet.  To my great joy he\r\nbrought the axe of the establishment, and I bade him\r\nfarewell.  How little did he think what was before him!\r\nSo soon as he had gone I went stealthily down the stairs,\r\nand stepping out into the deep snow, in front of the\r\nhotel, looked up into the lovely night.  The storm had\r\nceased, and I could see far back into the heavens.  In\r\nthe still evening my strokes might have been heard far\r\nand wide, as I cut down one of the two pretty Norways\r\nthat shaded Mr. Pynchon's front walk, next the hotel.  I\r\ndragged it over the snow.  Blatchford and Steele lowered\r\nsheets to me from the large parlor window, which I\r\nattached to the larger end of the tree.  With infinite\r\ndifficulty they hauled it in.  I joined them in the\r\nparlor, and soon we had as stately a tree growing there\r\nas was in any home of joy that night in the river\r\ncounties.\r\n\r\nWith swift fingers did our wives adorn it.  I should\r\nhave said above, that we travelled with our wives, and\r\nthat I would recommend that custom to others.  It was\r\nimpossible, under the circumstances, to maintain much\r\nsecrecy; but it had been agreed that all who wished to\r\nturn their backs to the circle, in the preparation of\r\npresents, might do so without offence to the others.  As\r\nthe presents were wrapped, one by one, in paper of\r\ndifferent colors, they were marked with the names of\r\ngiver and receiver, and placed in a large clothes-basket.\r\nAt last all was done.  I had wrapped up my knife, my\r\npencil-case, my lettercase, for Steele, Blatchford, and\r\nDick.  To my wife I gave my gold watch-key, which\r\nfortunately fits her watch; to Hosanna, a mere trifle, a\r\nseal ring I wore; to Bertha, my gold chain; and to Sarah\r\nBlatchford, the watch which generally hung from it.  For\r\na few moments we retired to our rooms while the pretty\r\nHosanna arranged the forty-nine presents on the tree.\r\nThen she clapped her hands, and we rushed in.  What a\r\nwondrous sight!  What a shout of infantine laughter and\r\ncharming prattle! for in that happy moment were we not\r\nall children again?\r\n\r\nI see my story hurries to its close.  Dick, who is\r\nthe tallest, mounted a step-ladder, and called us by name\r\nto receive our presents.  I had a nice gold watch-key\r\nfrom Hosanna, a knife from Steele, a letter-case from\r\nPhebe, and a pretty pencil-case from Bertha.  Dick had\r\ngiven me his watch-chain, which he knew I fancied;\r\nSarah Blatchford, a little toy of a Geneva watch she\r\nwore; and her husband, a handsome seal ring,--a present\r\nto him from the Czar, I believe; Phebe, that is my\r\nwife,--for we were travelling with our wives,--had a\r\npencil-case from Steele, a pretty little letter-case from\r\nDick, a watch-key from me, and a French repeater from\r\nBlatchford; Sarah Blatchford gave her the knife she\r\ncarried, with some bright verses, saying that it was not\r\nto cut love; Bertha, a watch-chain; and Hosanna, a ring\r\nof turquoise and amethysts.  The other presents were\r\nsimilar articles, and were received, as they were given,\r\nwith much tender feeling.  But at this moment, as Dick\r\nwas on the top of the flight of steps, handing down a red\r\napple from the tree, a slight catastrophe occurred.\r\n\r\nThe first thing I was conscious of was the angry hiss\r\nof steam.  In a moment I perceived that the steam-boiler,\r\nfrom which the tavern was warmed, had exploded.  The\r\nfloor beneath us rose, and we were driven with it through\r\nthe ceiling and the rooms above,--through an opening in\r\nthe roof into the still night.  Around us in the air were\r\nflying all the other contents and occupants of the Star\r\nand Eagle.  How bitterly was I reminded of Dick's flight\r\nfrom the railroad track of the Ithaca and Owego Railroad!\r\nBut I could not hope such an escape as his.  Still my\r\nflight was in a parabola; and, in a period not longer\r\nthan it has taken to describe it, I was thrown senseless,\r\nat last, into a deep snow-bank near the United\r\nStates Arsenal.\r\n\r\nTender hands lifted me and assuaged me.  Tender teams\r\ncarried me to the City Hospital.  Tender eyes brooded\r\nover me.  Tender science cared for me.  It proved\r\nnecessary, before I recovered, to amputate my two legs at\r\nthe hips.  My right arm was wholly removed, by a delicate\r\nand curious operation, from the socket.  We saved the\r\nstump of my left arm, which was amputated just below the\r\nshoulder.  I am still in the hospital to recruit my\r\nstrength.  The doctor does not like to have me occupy my\r\nmind at all; but he says there is no harm in my compiling\r\nmy memoirs, or writing magazine stories.  My faithful\r\nnurse has laid me on my breast on a pillow, has put a\r\ncamel's-hair pencil in my mouth, and, feeling almost\r\npersonally acquainted with John Carter, the artist, I\r\nhave written out for you, in his method, the story of my\r\nlast Christmas.\r\n\r\nI am sorry to say that the others have never been found.",
