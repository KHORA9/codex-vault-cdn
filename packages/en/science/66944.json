A more careful even though a rapid\r\nreview of the subject will, however, show how the Theory of Relativity\r\ngradually became a historical necessity.\r\n\r\nTowards the beginning of the nineteenth century, the luminiferous ether\r\ncame into prominence as a result of the brilliant successes of the wave\r\ntheory in the hands of Young and Fresnel. In its stationary aspect the\r\nelastic solid ether was the outcome of the search for a medium in which\r\nthe light waves may “undulate.” This stationary ether, as shown by\r\nYoung, also afforded a satisfactory explanation of astronomical\r\naberration. But its very success gave rise to a host of new questions\r\nall bearing on the central problem of relative motion of ether and\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n_Arago’s prism experiment._—The refractive index of a glass prism\r\ndepends on the incident velocity of light outside the prism and its\r\nvelocity inside the prism after refraction. On Fresnel’s fixed ether\r\nhypothesis, the incident light waves are situated in the stationary\r\nether outside the prism and move with velocity _c_ with respect to the\r\nether. If the prism moves with a velocity _u_ with respect to this fixed\r\nether, then the incident velocity of light with respect to the prism\r\nshould be _c_ + _u_. Thus the refractive index of the glass prism should\r\ndepend on _u_ the absolute velocity of the prism, _i.e._, its velocity\r\nwith respect to the fixed ether. Arago performed the experiment in 1819,\r\nbut failed to detect the expected change.\r\n\r\n_Airy-Boscovitch water-telescope experiment._—Boscovitch had still\r\nearlier in 1766, raised the very important question of the dependence of\r\naberration on the refractive index of the medium filling the telescope.\r\nAberration depends on the difference in the velocity of light outside\r\nthe telescope and its velocity inside the telescope. If the latter\r\nvelocity changes owing to a change in the medium filling the telescope,\r\naberration itself should change, that is, aberration should depend on\r\nthe nature of the medium.\r\n\r\nAiry, in 1871 filled up a telescope with water—but failed to detect any\r\nchange in the aberration. Thus we get both in the case of Arago prism\r\nexperiment and Airy-Boscovitch water-telescope experiment, the very\r\nstartling result that optical effects in a moving medium seem to be\r\nquite independent of the velocity of the medium with respect to\r\nFresnel’s stationary ether.\r\n\r\n_Fresnel’s convection coefficient k = 1 - 1/μ^2._—Possibly some form\r\nof compensation is taking place. Working on this hypothesis, Fresnel\r\noffered his famous ether convection theory. According to Fresnel, the\r\npresence of matter implies a definite condensation of ether within the\r\nregion occupied by matter. This “condensed” or excess portion of ether\r\nis supposed to be carried away with its own piece of moving matter. It\r\nshould be observed that only the “excess” portion is carried away,\r\nwhile the rest remains as stagnant as ever. A complete convection of\r\nthe “excess” ether ρ′ with the full velocity _u_ is optically\r\nequivalent to a partial convection of the total ether ρ, with only a\r\nfraction of the velocity _k_. _u_. Fresnel showed that if this\r\nconvection coefficient _k_ is 1 - 1/μ^2 (μ being the refractive index\r\nof the prism), then the velocity of light after refraction within the\r\nmoving prism would be altered to just such extent as would make the\r\nrefractive index of the moving prism quite independent of its\r\n“absolute” velocity _u_. The non-dependence of aberration on the\r\n“absolute” velocity _u_, is also very easily explained with the help\r\nof this Fresnelian convection-coefficient _k_.\r\n\r\n_Stokes’ viscous ether._—It should be remembered, however, that\r\nFresnel’s stationary ether is absolutely fixed and is not at all\r\ndisturbed by the motion of matter through it. In this respect Fresnelian\r\nether cannot be said to behave in any respectable physical fashion, and\r\nthis led Stokes, in 1845-46, to construct a more material type of\r\nmedium. Stokes assumed that viscous motion ensues near the surface of\r\nseparation of ether and moving matter, while at sufficiently distant\r\nregions the ether remains wholly undisturbed. He showed how such a\r\nviscous ether would explain aberration if all motion in it were\r\ndifferentially irrotational. But in order to explain the null Arago\r\neffect, Stokes was compelled to assume the convection hypothesis of\r\nFresnel with an identical numerical value for _k_, namely 1 - 1/μ^2.\r\nThus the prestige of the Fresnelian convection-coefficient was enhanced,\r\nif anything, by the theoretical investigations of Stokes.\r\n\r\n_Fizeau’s experiment._—Soon after, in 1851, it received direct\r\nexperimental confirmation in a brilliant piece of work by Fizeau.\r\n\r\nIf a divided beam of light is re-united after passing through two\r\nadjacent cylinders filled with water, ordinary interference fringes will\r\nbe produced. If the water in one of the cylinders is now made to flow,\r\nthe “condensed” ether within the flowing water would be convected and\r\nwould produce a shift in the interference fringes. The shift actually\r\nobserved agreed very well with a value of k = 1 - 1/μ^2. The Fresnelian\r\nconvection-coefficient now became firmly established as a consequence of\r\na direct positive effect. On the other hand, the negative evidences in\r\nfavour of the convection-coefficient had also multiplied. Mascart, Hoek,\r\nMaxwell and others sought for definite changes in different optical\r\neffects induced by the motion of the earth relative to the stationary\r\nether. But all such attempts failed to reveal the slightest trace of any\r\noptical disturbance due to the “absolute” velocity of the earth, thus\r\nproving conclusively that all the different optical effects shared in\r\nthe general compensation arising out of the Fresnelian convection of the\r\nexcess ether. It must be carefully noted that the Fresnelian\r\nconvection-coefficient implicitly assumes the existence of a fixed ether\r\n(Fresnel) or at least a wholly stagnant medium at sufficiently distant\r\nregions (Stokes), with reference to which alone a convection velocity\r\ncan have any significance. Thus the convection-coefficient implying some\r\ntype of a stationary or viscous, yet nevertheless “absolute” ether,\r\nsucceeded in explaining satisfactorily all known optical facts down to\r\n1880.\r\n\r\n_Michelson-Morley Experiment._—In 1881, Michelson and Morley performed\r\ntheir classical experiments which undermined the whole structure of the\r\nold ether theory and thus served to introduce the new theory of\r\nrelativity. The fundamental idea underlying this experiment is quite\r\nsimple. In all old experiments the velocity of light situated in free\r\nether was compared with the velocity of waves actually situated in a\r\npiece of moving matter and presumably carried away by it. The\r\ncompensatory effect of the Fresnelian convection of ether afforded a\r\nsatisfactory explanation of all negative results.\r\n\r\nIn the Michelson-Morley experiment the arrangement is quite different.\r\nIf there is a definite gap in a rigid body, light waves situated in free\r\nether will take a definite time in crossing the gap. If the rigid\r\nplatform carrying the gap is set in motion with respect to the ether in\r\nthe direction of light propagation, light waves (which are even now\r\nsituated in free ether) should presumably take a longer time to cross\r\nthe gap.\r\n\r\nWe cannot do better than quote Eddington’s description of this famous\r\nexperiment. “The principle of the experiment may be illustrated by\r\nconsidering a swimmer in a river. It is easily realized that it takes\r\nlonger to swim to a point 50 yards up-stream and back than to a point 50\r\nyards across-stream and back. If the earth is moving through the ether\r\nthere is a river of ether flowing through the laboratory, and a wave of\r\nlight may be compared to a swimmer travelling with constant velocity\r\nrelative to the current. If, then, we divide a beam of light into two\r\nparts, and send one-half swimming up the stream for a certain distance\r\nand then (by a mirror) back to the starting point, and send the other\r\nhalf an equal distance across stream and back, the across-stream beam\r\nshould arrive back first.\r\n\r\n                                       ——>_u_\r\n                                     O\r\n                               A—————........\r\n                                     |    _x_\r\n                                     |\r\n                                     |B\r\n\r\nLet the ether be flowing relative to the apparatus with velocity _u_ in\r\nthe direction O_x_, and let OA, OB, be the two arms of the apparatus of\r\nequal length _l_, OA being placed up-stream. Let _c_ be the velocity of\r\nlight. The time for the double journey along OA and back is\r\n\r\n                        l         l       2lc       2l\r\n                  t₁ = ------ + ------ = -------- = --- β²\r\n                       c - u    c + u    c² - u²     c\r\n\r\nwhere\r\n\r\n$$ \\beta = (1 - \\frac {u^2}{c^2})^{-\\frac {1}{2}} $$\r\n\r\na factor greater than unity.\r\n\r\nFor the transverse journey the light must have a component velocity _n_\r\nup-stream (relative to the ether) in order to avoid being carried below\r\nOB: and since its total velocity is _c_, its component across-stream\r\nmust be √(_c²_ - _u²_), the time for the double journey OB is\r\naccordingly\r\n\r\n$$ t_2 = \\frac {2a}{\\sqrt {c^2 - u^2}} = \\frac {2a}{c} \\beta $$\r\n\r\nso that _t₁_ > _t₂_.\r\n\r\nBut when the experiment was tried, it was found that both parts of the\r\nbeam took the same time, as tested by the interference bands produced.”\r\n\r\nAfter a most careful series of observations, Michelson and Morley failed\r\nto detect the slightest trace of any effect due to earth’s motion\r\nthrough ether.\r\n\r\nThe Michelson-Morley experiment seems to show that there is no relative\r\nmotion of ether and matter. Fresnel’s stagnant ether requires a relative\r\nvelocity of—_u_. Thus Michelson and Morley themselves thought at first\r\nthat their experiment confirmed Stokes’ viscous ether, in which no\r\nrelative motion can ensue on account of the absence of slipping of ether\r\nat the surface of separation. But even on Stokes’ theory this viscous\r\nflow of ether would fall off at a very rapid rate as we recede from the\r\nsurface of separation. Michelson and Morley repeated their experiment at\r\ndifferent heights from the surface of the earth, but invariably obtained\r\nthe same negative results, thus failing to confirm Stokes’ theory of\r\nviscous flow.\r\n\r\n_Lodge’s experiment._—Further, in 1893, Lodge performed his rotating\r\nsphere experiment which showed complete absence of any viscous flow of\r\nether due to moving masses of matter. A divided beam of light, after\r\nrepeated reflections within a very narrow gap between two massive\r\nhemispheres, was allowed to re-unite and thus produce interference\r\nbands. When the two hemispheres are set rotating, it is conceivable that\r\nthe ether in the gap would be disturbed due to viscous flow, and any\r\nsuch flow would be immediately detected by a disturbance of the\r\ninterference bands. But actual observation failed to detect the\r\nslightest disturbance of the ether in the gap, due to the motion of the\r\nhemispheres. Lodge’s experiment thus seems to show a complete absence of\r\nany viscous flow of ether.\r\n\r\nApart from these experimental discrepancies, grave theoretical\r\nobjections were urged against a viscous ether. Stokes himself had shown\r\nthat his ether must be incompressible and all motion in it\r\ndifferentially irrotational, at the same time there should be absolutely\r\nno slipping at the surface of separation. Now all these conditions\r\ncannot be simultaneously satisfied for any conceivable material medium\r\nwithout certain very special and arbitrary assumptions. Thus Stokes’\r\nether failed to satisfy the very motive which had led Stokes to\r\nformulate it, namely, the desirability of constructing a “physical”\r\nmedium. Planck offered modified forms of Stokes’ theory which seemed\r\ncapable of being reconciled with the Michelson-Morley experiment, but\r\nrequired very special assumptions. The very complexity and the very\r\narbitrariness of these assumptions prevented Planck’s ether from\r\nattaining any degree of practical importance in the further development\r\nof the subject.\r\n\r\nThe sole criterion of the value of any scientific theory must ultimately\r\nbe its capacity for offering a simple, unified, coherent and fruitful\r\ndescription of observed facts. In proportion as a theory becomes complex\r\nit loses in usefulness—a theory which is obliged to requisition a whole\r\narray of arbitrary assumptions in order to explain special facts is\r\npractically worse than useless, as it serves to disjoin, rather than to\r\nunite, the several groups of facts. The optical experiments of the last\r\nquarter of the nineteenth century showed the impossibility of\r\nconstructing a simple ether theory, which would be amenable to analytic\r\ntreatment and would at the same time stimulate further progress. It\r\nshould be observed that it could scarcely be shown that no logically\r\nconsistent ether theory was possible; indeed in 1910, H. A. Wilson\r\noffered a consistent ether theory which was at least quite neutral with\r\nrespect to all available optical data. But Wilson’s ether is almost\r\nwholly negative—its only virtue being that it does not directly\r\ncontradict observed facts. Neither any direct confirmation nor a direct\r\nrefutation is possible and it does not throw any light on the various\r\noptical phenomena. A theory like this being practically useless stands\r\nself-condemned.\r\n\r\nWe must now consider the problem of relative motion of ether and matter\r\nfrom the point of view of electrical theory. From 1860 the identity of\r\nlight as an electromagnetic vector became gradually established as a\r\nresult of the brilliant “displacement current” hypothesis of Clerk\r\nMaxwell and his further analytical investigations. The elastic solid\r\nether became gradually transformed into the electromagnetic one. Maxwell\r\nsucceeded in giving a fairly satisfactory account of all ordinary\r\noptical phenomena and little room was left for any serious doubts as\r\nregards the general validity of Maxwell’s theory. Hertz’s researches on\r\nelectric waves, first carried out in 1886, succeeded in furnishing a\r\nstrong experimental confirmation of Maxwell’s theory. Electric waves\r\nbehaved generally like light waves of very large wave length.\r\n\r\nThe orthodox Maxwellian view located the dielectric polarisation in the\r\nelectromagnetic ether which was merely a transformation of Fresnel’s\r\nstagnant ether. The magnetic polarisation was looked upon as wholly\r\nsecondary in origin, being due to the relative motion of the dielectric\r\ntubes of polarisation. On this view the Fresnelian convection\r\ncoefficient comes out to be ½, as shown by J. J. Thomson in 1880,\r\ninstead of 1 - (1/μ²) as required by optical experiments. This obviously\r\nimplies a complete failure to account for all those optical experiments\r\nwhich depend for their satisfactory explanation on the assumption of a\r\nvalue for the convection coefficient equal to 1 - (1/μ²).\r\n\r\nThe modifications proposed independently by Hertz and Heaviside fare no\r\nbetter.[1] They postulated the actual medium to be the seat of all\r\nelectric polarisation and further emphasised the reciprocal relation\r\nsubsisting between electricity and magnetism, thus making the field\r\nequations more symmetrical. On this view the whole of the polarised\r\nether is carried away by the moving medium, and consequently, the\r\nconvection coefficient naturally becomes unity in this theory, a value\r\nquite as discrepant as that obtained on the original Maxwellian\r\nassumption.\r\n\r\nThus neither Maxwell’s original theory nor its subsequent modifications\r\nas developed by Hertz and Heaviside succeeded in obtaining a value for\r\nFresnelian coefficient equal to 1 - (1/μ^2), and consequently stood\r\ntotally condemned from the optical point of view.\r\n\r\nCertain direct electromagnetic experiments involving relative motion of\r\npolarised dielectrics were no less conclusive against the generalised\r\ntheory of Hertz and Heaviside. According to Hertz a moving dielectric\r\nwould carry away the whole of its electric displacement with it. Hence\r\nthe electromagnetic effect near the moving dielectric would be\r\nproportional to the total electric displacement, that is to K, the\r\nspecific inductive capacity of the dielectric. In 1901, Blondlot working\r\nwith a stream of moving gas could not detect any such effect. H. A.\r\nWilson repeated the experiment in an improved form in 1903 and working\r\nwith ebonite found that the observed effect was proportional to K - 1\r\ninstead of to K. For gases K is nearly equal to 1 and hence practically\r\nno effect will be observed in their case. This gives a satisfactory\r\nexplanation of Blondlot’s negative results.\r\n\r\nRowland had shown in 1876 that the magnetic force due to a rotating\r\ncondenser (the dielectric remaining stationary) was proportional to K,\r\nthe sp. ind. cap. On the other hand, Röntgen found in 1888 the magnetic\r\neffect due to a rotating dielectric (the condenser remaining stationary)\r\nto be proportional to K - 1, and not to K. Finally Eichenwald in 1903\r\nfound that when both condenser and dielectric are rotated together, the\r\neffect observed was quite independent of K, a result quite consistent\r\nwith the two previous experiments. The Rowland effect proportional to K,\r\ntogether with the opposite Röntgen effect proportional to 1 - K, makes\r\nthe Eichenwald effect independent of K.\r\n\r\nAll these experiments together with those of Blondlot and Wilson made it\r\nclear that the electromagnetic effect due to a moving dielectric was\r\nproportional to K - 1, and not to K as required by Hertz’s theory. Thus\r\nthe above group of experiments with moving dielectrics directly\r\ncontradicted the Hertz-Heaviside theory. The internal discrepancies\r\ninherent in the classic ether theory had now become too prominent. It\r\nwas clear that the ether concept had finally outgrown its usefulness.\r\nThe observed facts had become too contradictory and too heterogeneous to\r\nbe reduced to an organised whole with the help of the ether concept\r\nalone. Radical departures from the classical theory had become\r\nabsolutely necessary.\r\n\r\nThere were several outstanding difficulties in connection with anomalous\r\ndispersion, selective reflection and selective absorption which could\r\nnot be satisfactory explained in the classic electromagnetic theory. It\r\nwas evident that the assumption of some kind of discreteness in the\r\noptical medium had become inevitable. Such an assumption naturally gave\r\nrise to an atomic theory of electricity, namely, the modern electron\r\ntheory. Lorentz had postulated the existence of electrons so early as\r\n1878, but it was not until some years later that the electron theory\r\nbecame firmly established on a satisfactory basis.\r\n\r\nLorentz assumed that a moving dielectric merely carried away its own\r\n“polarisation doublets,” which on his theory gave rise to the induced\r\nfield proportional to K - 1. The field near a moving dielectric is\r\nnaturally proportional to K - 1 and not to K. Lorentz’s theory thus gave\r\na satisfactory explanation of all those experiments with moving\r\ndielectrics which required effects proportional to K - 1. Lorentz\r\nfurther succeeded in obtaining a value for the Fresnelian convection\r\ncoefficient equal to 1 - 1/μ^2, the exact value required by all optical\r\nexperiments of the moving type.\r\n\r\nWe must now go back to Michelson and Morley’s experiment. We have seen\r\nthat both parts of the beam are situated in free ether; no material\r\nmedium is involved in any portion of the paths actually traversed by the\r\nbeam. Consequently no compensation due to Fresnelian convection of ether\r\nby moving medium is possible. Thus Fresnelian convection compensation\r\ncan have no possible application in this case. Yet some marvellous\r\ncompensation has evidently taken place which has completely masked the\r\n“absolute” velocity of the earth.\r\n\r\nIn Michelson and Morley’s experiment, the distance travelled by the beam\r\nalong OA (that is, in a direction parallel to the motion of the\r\nplatform) is 2_l_β², while the distance travelled by the beam along OB,\r\nperpendicular to the direction of motion of the platform, is 2_l_β. Yet\r\nthe most careful experiments showed, as Eddington says, “that both parts\r\nof the beam took the same time as tested by the interference bands\r\nproduced. It would seem that OA and OB could not really have been of the\r\nsame length; and if OB was of length _l_, OA must have been of length\r\n_l_/β. The apparatus was now rotated through 90°, so that OB became the\r\nup-stream. The time for the two journeys was again the same, so that 0B\r\nmust now be the shorter length. The plain meaning of the experiment is\r\nthat both arms have a length _l_ when placed along O_y_ (perpendicular\r\nto the direction of motion), and automatically contract to a length\r\n_l_/β, when placed along O_x_ (parallel to the direction of motion).\r\nThis explanation was first given by Fitz-Gerald.”\r\n\r\nThis Fitz-Gerald contraction, startling enough in itself, does not\r\nsuffice. Assuming this contraction to be a real one, the distance\r\ntravelled with respect to the ether is 2_l_β and the time taken for this\r\njourney is 2_l_β/_c_. But the distance travelled with respect to the\r\nplatform is always 2_l_. Hence the velocity of light with respect to the\r\nplatform is\r\n\r\n$$ \\frac {2l}{\\frac {2l\\beta}{c}} = \\frac {c}{\\beta} $$\r\n\r\na variable quantity depending on the “absolute” velocity of the\r\nplatform. But no trace of such an effect has ever been found. The\r\nvelocity of light is always found to be quite independent of the\r\nvelocity of the platform. The present difficulty cannot be solved by any\r\nfurther alteration in the measure of space. The only recourse left open\r\nis to alter the measure of time as well, that is, to adopt the concept\r\nof “local time.” If a moving clock goes slower so that one ‘real’ second\r\nbecomes 1/β second as measured in the moving system, the velocity of\r\nlight relative to the platform will always remain _c_. We must adopt two\r\nvery startling hypotheses, namely, the Fitz-Gerald contraction and the\r\nconcept of “local time,” in order to give a satisfactory explanation of\r\nthe Michelson-Morley experiment.\r\n\r\nThese results were already reached by Lorentz in the course of further\r\ndevelopments of his electron theory. Lorentz used a special set of\r\ntransformation equations[2] for time which implicitly introduced the\r\nconcept of local time. But he himself failed to attach any special\r\nsignificance to it, and looked upon it rather as a mere mathematical\r\nartifice like imaginary quantities in analysis or the circle at infinity\r\nin projective geometry. The originality of Einstein at this stage\r\nconsists in his successful physical interpretation of these results, and\r\nviewing them as the coherent organised consequences of a single general\r\nprinciple. Lorentz established the Relativity Theorem[3] (consisting\r\nmerely of a set of transformation equations) while Einstein generalised\r\nit into a Universal Principle. In addition Einstein introduced\r\nfundamentally new concepts of space and time, which served to destroy\r\nold fetishes and demanded a wholesale revision of scientific concepts\r\nand thus opened up new possibilities in the synthetic unification of\r\nnatural processes.\r\n\r\nNewton had framed his laws of motion in such a way as to make them quite\r\nindependent of the absolute velocity of the earth. Uniform relative\r\nmotion of ether and matter could not be detected with the help of\r\ndynamical laws. According to Einstein neither could it be detected with\r\nthe help of optical or electromagnetic experiments. Thus the Einsteinian\r\nPrinciple of Relativity asserts that all physical laws are independent\r\nof the ‘absolute’ velocity of an observer.\r\n\r\nFor different systems, the _form_ of all physical laws is conserved. If\r\nwe chose the velocity of light[4] to be the fundamental unit of\r\nmeasurement for all observers (that is, assume the constancy of the\r\nvelocity of light in all systems) we can establish a _metric_ “one-one”\r\ncorrespondence between any two observed systems, such correspondence\r\ndepending only the _relative_ velocity of the two systems. Einstein’s\r\nRelativity is thus merely the consistent logical application of the well\r\nknown physical principle that we can know nothing but _relative_ motion.\r\nIn this sense it is a further extension of Newtonian Relativity.\r\n\r\nOn this interpretation, the Lorentz-Fitzgerald contraction and “local\r\ntime” lose their arbitrary character. Space and time as measured by two\r\ndifferent observers are naturally diverse, and the difference depends\r\nonly on their relative motion. Both are equally valid; they are merely\r\ndifferent descriptions of the same physical reality. This is essentially\r\nthe point of view adopted by Minkowski. He considers time itself to be\r\none of the co-ordinate axes, and in his four-dimensional world, that is\r\nin the space-time reality, relative motion is reduced to a rotation of\r\nthe axes of reference. Thus, the diversity in the measurement of lengths\r\nand temporal rates is merely due to the static difference in the\r\n“frame-work” of the different observers.\r\n\r\nThe above theory of Relativity absorbed practically the whole of the\r\nelectromagnetic theory based on the Maxwell-Lorentz system of field\r\nequations. It combined all the advantages of classic Maxwellian theory\r\ntogether with an electronic hypothesis. The Lorentz assumption of\r\npolarisation doublets had furnished a satisfactory explanation of the\r\nFresnelian convection of ether, but in the new theory this is deduced\r\nmerely as a consequence of the altered concept of relative velocity. In\r\naddition, the theory of Relativity accepted the results of Michelson and\r\nMorley’s experiments as a definite principle, namely, the principle of\r\nthe constancy of the velocity of light, so that there was nothing left\r\nfor explanation in the Michelson-Morley experiment. But even more than\r\nall this, it established a single general principle which served to\r\nconnect together in a simple coherent and fruitful manner the known\r\nfacts of Physics.\r\n\r\nThe theory of Relativity received direct experimental confirmation in\r\nseveral directions. Repeated attempts were made to detect the\r\nLorentz-Fitzgerald contraction. Any ordinary physical contraction will\r\nusually have observable physical results; for example, the total\r\nelectrical resistance of a conductor will diminish. Trouton and Noble,\r\nTrouton and Rankine, Rayleigh and Brace, and others employed a variety\r\nof different methods to detect the Lorentz-Fitzgerald contraction, but\r\ninvariably with the same negative results. _Whether there is an ether or\r\nnot, uniform velocity with respect to it can never be detected._ This\r\ndoes not prove that there is no such thing as an ether but certainly\r\ndoes render the ether entirely superfluous. Universal compensation is\r\ndue to a change in local units of length and time, or rather, being\r\nmerely different descriptions of the same reality, there is no\r\ncompensation at all.\r\n\r\nThere was another group of observed phenomena which could scarcely be\r\nfitted into a Newtonian scheme of dynamics without doing violence to it.\r\nThe experimental work of Kaufmann, in 1901, made it abundantly clear\r\nthat the “mass” of an electron depended on its velocity. So early as\r\n1881, J. J. Thomson had shown that the inertia of a charged particle\r\nincreased with its velocity. Abraham now deduced a formula for the\r\nvariation of mass with velocity, on the hypothesis that an electron\r\nalways remained a _rigid_ sphere. Lorentz proceeded on the assumption\r\nthat the electron shared in the Lorentz-Fitzgerald contraction and\r\nobtained a totally different formula. A very careful series of\r\nmeasurements carried out independently by Bücherer, Wolz, Hupka and\r\nfinally Neumann in 1913, decided conclusively in favour of the Lorentz\r\nformula. This “contractile” formula follows immediately as a direct\r\nconsequence of the new Theory of Relativity, without any assumption as\r\nregards the electrical origin of inertia. Thus the complete agreement of\r\nexperimental facts with the predictions of the new theory must be\r\nconsidered as confirming it as a principle which goes even beyond the\r\nelectron itself. The greatest triumph of this new theory consists,\r\nindeed, in the fact that a large number of results, which had formerly\r\nrequired all kinds of special hypotheses for their explanation, are now\r\ndeduced very simply as inevitable consequences of one single general\r\nprinciple.\r\n\r\nWe have now traced the history of the development of the restricted or\r\nspecial theory of Relativity, which is mainly concerned with optical and\r\nelectrical phenomena. It was first offered by Einstein in 1905. Ten\r\nyears later, Einstein formulated his second theory, the Generalised\r\nPrinciple of Relativity. This new theory is mainly a theory of\r\ngravitation and has very little connection with optics and electricity.\r\nIn one sense, the second theory is indeed a further generalisation of\r\nthe restricted principle, but the former does not really contain the\r\nlatter as a special case.\r\n\r\nEinstein’s first theory is restricted in the sense that it only refers\r\nto uniform rectilinear motion and has no application to any kind of\r\naccelerated movements. Einstein in his second theory extends the\r\nRelativity Principle to cases of accelerated motion. If Relativity is to\r\nbe universally true, then even accelerated motion must be merely\r\n_relative motion between matter and matter_. Hence the Generalised\r\nPrinciple of Relativity asserts that “absolute” motion cannot be\r\ndetected even with the help of gravitational laws.\r\n\r\nAll movements must be referred to definite sets of co-ordinate axes. If\r\nthere is any change of axes, the numerical magnitude of the movements\r\nwill also change. But according to Newtonian dynamics, such alteration\r\nin physical movements can only be due to the effect of certain forces in\r\nthe field.[5] Thus any change of axes will introduce new “geometrical”\r\nforces in the field which are quite independent of the nature of the\r\nbody acted on. Gravitational forces also have this same remarkable\r\nproperty, and gravitation itself may be of essentially the same nature\r\nas these “geometrical” forces introduced by a change of axes. This leads\r\nto Einstein’s famous Principle of Equivalence. _A gravitational field of\r\nforce is strictly equivalent to one introduced by a transformation of\r\nco-ordinates and no possible experiment can distinguish between the\r\ntwo._\r\n\r\nThus it may become possible to “transform away” gravitational effects,\r\nat least for sufficiently small regions of space, by referring all\r\nmovements to a new set of axes. This new “framework” may of course have\r\nall kinds of very complicated movements when referred to the old\r\nGalilean or “rectangular unaccelerated system of co-ordinates.”\r\n\r\nBut there is no reason why we should look upon the Galilean system as\r\nmore fundamental than any other. If it is found simpler to refer all\r\nmotion in a gravitational field to a special set of co-ordinates, we may\r\ncertainly look upon this special “framework” (at least for the\r\nparticular region concerned), to be more fundamental and more natural.\r\nWe may, still more simply, identify this particular framework with the\r\nspecial local properties of space in that region. That is, we can look\r\nupon the effects of a gravitational field as simply due to the local\r\nproperties of space and time itself. The very presence of matter implies\r\na modification of the characteristics of space and time in its\r\nneighbourhood. As Eddington says “matter does not cause the curvature of\r\nspace-time. It is the curvature. Just as light does not cause\r\nelectromagnetic oscillations; it is the oscillations.”\r\n\r\nWe may look upon this from a slightly different point of view. The\r\nGeneral Principle of Relativity asserts that all motion is merely\r\nrelative motion between matter and matter, and as all movements must be\r\nreferred to definite sets of co-ordinates, the ground of any possible\r\nframework must ultimately be material in character. It _is_ convenient\r\nto take the matter actually present in a field as the fundamental ground\r\nof our framework. If this is done, the special characteristics of our\r\nframework would naturally depend on the actual distribution of matter in\r\nthe field. But physical space and time is completely defined by the\r\n“framework.” In other words the “framework” itself _is_ space and time.\r\nHence we see how _physical_ space and time is actually defined by the\r\nlocal distribution of matter.\r\n\r\nThere are certain magnitudes which remain constant by any change of\r\naxes. In ordinary geometry distance between two points is one such\r\nmagnitude; so that δ_x²_ + δ_y²_ + δ_z²_ is an invariant. In the\r\nrestricted theory of light, the principle of constancy of light velocity\r\ndemands that δ_x²_ + δ_y²_ + δ_z²_ - _c²_δ_t²_ should remain constant.\r\n\r\nThe _separation ds_ of adjacent events is defined by _ds²_ = -_dx²_ -\r\n_dy²_ - _dz²_ + _c²dt²_. It is an extension of the notion of distance\r\nand this is the new invariant. Now if _x_, _y_, _z_, _t_ are transformed\r\nto any set of new variables _x₁_, _x₂_, _x₃_, _x₄_, we shall get a\r\nquadratic expression for\r\n\r\n$$ ds^2 = g_{1\\;1}x_{1}^2 + 2g_{1\\;2}x_{1}x_{2} + ... = \\sum\r\ng_{i\\;j}x_{i}x_{j} $$\r\n\r\nwhere the _g_’s are functions of _x₁_, _x₂_, _x₃_, _x₄_ depending on the\r\ntransformation.\r\n\r\nThe special properties of space and time in any region are defined by\r\nthese _g_’s which are themselves determined by the actual distribution\r\nof matter in the locality. Thus from the Newtonian point of view, these\r\n_g_’s represent the gravitational effect of matter while from the\r\nRelativity stand-point, these merely define the non-Newtonian (and\r\nincidentally non-Euclidean) space in the neighbourhood of matter.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that Einstein’s theory requires local curvature of\r\nspace-time in the neighbourhood of matter. Such altered characteristics\r\nof space and time give a satisfactory explanation of an outstanding\r\ndiscrepancy in the observed advance of perihelion of Mercury. The large\r\ndiscordance is almost completely removed by Einstein’s theory.\r\n\r\nAgain, in an intense gravitational field, a beam of light will be\r\naffected by the local curvature of space, so that to an observer who is\r\nreferring all phenomena to a Newtonian system, the beam of light will\r\nappear to deviate from its path along an Euclidean straight line.\r\n\r\nThis famous prediction of Einstein about the deflection of a beam of\r\nlight by the sun’s gravitational field was tested during the total solar\r\neclipse of May, 1919. The observed deflection is decisively in favour of\r\nthe Generalised Theory of Relativity.\r\n\r\nIt should be noted however that the velocity of light itself would\r\ndecrease in a gravitational field. This may appear at first sight to be\r\na violation of the principle of constancy of light-velocity. But when we\r\nremember that the Special Theory is explicitly _restricted_ to the case\r\nof unaccelerated motion, the difficulty vanishes. In the absence of a\r\ngravitational field, that is in any unaccelerated system, the velocity\r\nof light will always remain constant. Thus the validity of the Special\r\nTheory is completely preserved within its own _restricted_ field.\r\n\r\nEinstein has proposed a third crucial test. He has predicted a shift of\r\nspectral lines towards the red, due to an intense gravitational\r\npotential. Experimental difficulties are very considerable here, as the\r\nshift of spectral lines is a complex phenomenon. Evidence is conflicting\r\nand nothing conclusive can yet be asserted. Einstein thought that a\r\ngravitational displacement of the Fraunhofer lines is a necessary and\r\nfundamental condition for the acceptance of his theory. But Eddington\r\nhas pointed out that even if this test fails, the logical conclusion\r\nwould seem to be that while Einstein’s law of gravitation is true for\r\nmatter in bulk, it is not true for such small material systems as atomic\r\noscillator.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Conclusion\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the conceptual stand-point there are several important consequences\r\nof the Generalised or Gravitational Theory of Relativity. Physical\r\nspace-time is perceived to be intimately connected with the actual local\r\ndistribution of matter. Euclid-Newtonian space-time is _not_ the actual\r\nspace-time of Physics, simply because the former completely neglects the\r\nactual presence of matter. Euclid-Newtonian continuum is merely an\r\nabstraction, while physical space-*time is the actual framework which\r\nhas some definite curvature due to the presence of matter. Gravitational\r\nTheory of Relativity thus brings out clearly the fundamental distinction\r\nbetween actual physical space-time (which is non-isotropic and\r\nnon-Euclid-Newtonian) on one hand and the abstract Euclid-Newtonian\r\ncontinuum (which is homogeneous, isotropic and a purely intellectual\r\nconstruction) on the other.\r\n\r\nThe measurements of the rotation of the earth reveals a fundamental\r\nframework which may be called the “inertial framework.” This constitutes\r\nthe actual physical universe. This universe approaches Galilean\r\nspace-time at a great distance from matter.\r\n\r\nThe properties of this physical universe may be referred to some\r\nworld-distribution of matter or the “inertial framework” may be\r\nconstructed by a suitable modification of the law of gravitation itself.\r\nIn Einstein’s theory the actual curvature of the “inertial framework” is\r\nreferred to vast quantities of undetected world-matter. It has\r\ninteresting consequences. The dimensions of Einsteinian universe would\r\ndepend on the quantity of matter in it; it would vanish to a point in\r\nthe total absence of matter. Then again curvature depends on the\r\nquantity of matter, and hence in the presence of a sufficient quantity\r\nof matter space-time may curve round and close up. Einsteinian universe\r\nwill then reduce to a finite system without boundaries, like the surface\r\nof a sphere. In this “closed up” system, light rays will come to a focus\r\nafter travelling round the universe and we should see an “anti-sun”\r\n(corresponding to the back surface of the sun) at a point in the sky\r\nopposite to the real sun. This anti-sun would of course be equally large\r\nand equally bright if there is no absorption of light in free space.\r\n\r\nIn de Sitter’s theory, the existence of vast quantities of world-matter\r\nis not required. But beyond a definite distance from an observer, time\r\nitself stands still, so that to the observer nothing can ever “happen”\r\nthere. All these theories are still highly speculative in character, but\r\nthey have certainly extended the scope of theoretical physics to the\r\ncentral problem of the ultimate nature of the universe itself.\r\n\r\nOne outstanding peculiarity still attaches to the concept of electric\r\nforce—it is not amenable to any process of being “transformed away” by a\r\nsuitable change of framework. H. Weyl, it seems, has developed a\r\ngeometrical theory (in hyper-space) in which no fundamental distinction\r\nis made between gravitational and electrical forces.\r\n\r\nEinstein’s theory connects up the law of gravitation with the laws of\r\nmotion, and serves to establish a very intimate relationship between\r\nmatter and physical space-*time. Space, time and matter (or energy) were\r\nconsidered to be the three ultimate elements in Physics. The restricted\r\ntheory fused space-time into one indissoluble whole. The generalised\r\ntheory has further synthesised space-time and matter into one\r\nfundamental physical reality. Space, time and matter taken separately\r\nare more abstractions. Physical reality consists of a synthesis of all\r\nthree.\r\n\r\nP. C. MAHALANOBIS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Note A.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor example consider a massive particle resting on a circular disc. If\r\nwe set the disc rotating, a centrifugal force appears in the field. On\r\nthe other hand, if we transform to a set of rotating axes, we must\r\nintroduce a centrifugal force in order to correct for the change of\r\naxes. This newly introduced centrifugal force is usually looked upon as\r\na mathematical fiction—as “geometrical” rather than physical. The\r\npresence of such a geometrical force is usually interpreted as being due\r\nto the adoption of a fictitious framework. On the other hand a\r\ngravitational force is considered quite real. Thus a fundamental\r\ndistinction is made between geometrical and gravitational forces.\r\n\r\nIn the General Theory of Relativity, this fundamental distinction is\r\ndone away with. The very possibility of distinguishing between\r\ngeometrical and gravitational forces is denied. All axes of reference\r\nmay now be regarded as equally valid.\r\n\r\nIn the Restricted Theory, all “unaccelerated” axes of reference were\r\nrecognised as equally valid, so that physical laws were made independent\r\nof uniform absolute velocity. In the General Theory, physical laws are\r\nmade independent of “absolute” motion of any kind.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1:\r\n\r\n  See Note 1.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2:\r\n\r\n  See Note 2.\r\n\r\nFootnote 3:\r\n\r\n  See Note 4.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4:\r\n\r\n  See Notes 9 and 12.\r\n\r\nFootnote 5:\r\n\r\n  Note A.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                On The Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies\r\n                                   By\r\n                              A. Einstein.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             INTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is well known that if we attempt to apply Maxwell’s electrodynamics,\r\nas conceived at the present time, to moving bodies, we are led to\r\nasymmetry which does not agree with observed phenomena. Let us think of\r\nthe mutual action between a magnet and a conductor. The observed\r\nphenomena in this case depend only on the relative motion of the\r\nconductor and the magnet, while according to the usual conception, a\r\ndistinction must be made between the cases where the one or the other of\r\nthe bodies is in motion. If, for example, the magnet moves and the\r\nconductor is at rest, then an electric field of certain energy-value is\r\nproduced in the neighbourhood of the magnet, which excites a current in\r\nthose parts of the field where a conductor exists. But if the magnet be\r\nat rest and the conductor be set in motion, no electric field is\r\nproduced in the neighbourhood of the magnet, but an electromotive force\r\nwhich corresponds to no energy in itself is produced in the conductor;\r\nthis causes an electric current of the same magnitude and the same\r\ncareer as the electric force, it being of course assumed that the\r\nrelative motion in both of these cases is the same.\r\n\r\n2. Examples of a similar kind such as the unsuccessful attempt to\r\nsubstantiate the motion of the earth relative to the “Light-medium” lead\r\nus to the supposition that not only in mechanics, but also in\r\nelectrodynamics, no properties of observed facts correspond to a concept\r\nof absolute rest; but that for all coordinate systems for which the\r\nmechanical equations hold, the equivalent electrodynamical and optical\r\nequations hold also, as has already been shown for magnitudes of the\r\nfirst order. In the following we make these assumptions (which we shall\r\nsubsequently call the Principle of Relativity) and introduce the further\r\nassumption,—an assumption which is at the first sight quite\r\nirreconcilable with the former one—that light is propagated in vacant\r\nspace, with a velocity _c_ which is independent of the nature of motion\r\nof the emitting body. These two assumptions are quite sufficient to give\r\nus a simple and consistent theory of electrodynamics of moving bodies on\r\nthe basis of the Maxwellian theory for bodies at rest. The introduction\r\nof a “Lightäther” will be proved to be superfluous, for according to the\r\nconceptions which will be developed, we shall introduce neither a space\r\nabsolutely at rest, and endowed with special properties, nor shall we\r\nassociate a velocity-vector with a point in which electro-magnetic\r\nprocesses take place.\r\n\r\n3. Like every other theory in electrodynamics, the theory is based on\r\nthe kinematics of rigid bodies; in the enunciation of every theory, we\r\nhave to do with relations between rigid bodies (co-ordinate system),\r\nclocks, and electromagnetic processes. An insufficient consideration of\r\nthese circumstances is the cause of difficulties with which the\r\nelectrodynamics of moving bodies have to fight at present.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        I.—KINEMATICAL PORTION.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    § 1. Definition of Synchronism.\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us have a co-ordinate system, in which the Newtonian equations hold.\r\nFor distinguishing this system from another which will be introduced\r\nhereafter, we shall always call it “the stationary system.”\r\n\r\nIf a material point be at rest in this system, then its position in this\r\nsystem can be found out by a measuring rod, and can be expressed by the\r\nmethods of Euclidean Geometry, or in Cartesian co-ordinates.\r\n\r\nIf we wish to describe the motion of a material point, the values of its\r\ncoordinates must be expressed as functions of time. It is always to be\r\nborne in mind that _such a mathematical definition has a physical sense,\r\nonly when we have a clear notion of what is meant by time. We have to\r\ntake into consideration the fact that those of our conceptions, in which\r\ntime plays a part, are always conceptions of synchronism._ For example,\r\nwe say that a train arrives here at 7 o’clock; this means that the exact\r\npointing of the little hand of my watch to 7, and the arrival of the\r\ntrain are synchronous events.\r\n\r\nIt may appear that all difficulties connected with the definition of\r\ntime can be removed when in place of time, we substitute the position of\r\nthe little hand of my watch. Such a definition is in fact sufficient,\r\nwhen it is required to define time exclusively for the place at which\r\nthe clock is stationed. But the definition is not sufficient when it is\r\nrequired to connect by time events taking place at different\r\nstations,—or what amounts to the same thing,—to estimate by means of\r\ntime (zeitlich werten) the occurrence of events, which take place at\r\nstations distant from the clock.\r\n\r\nNow with regard to this attempt;—the time-estimation of events, we can\r\nsatisfy ourselves in the following manner. Suppose an observer—who is\r\nstationed at the origin of coordinates with the clock—associates a ray\r\nof light which comes to him through space, and gives testimony to the\r\nevent of which the time is to be estimated,—with the corresponding\r\nposition of the hands of the clock. But such an association has this\r\ndefect,—it depends on the position of the observer provided with the\r\nclock, as we know by experience. We can attain to a more practicable\r\nresult by the following treatment.\r\n\r\nIf an observer be stationed at A with a clock, he can estimate the time\r\nof events occurring in the immediate neighbourhood of A, by looking for\r\nthe position of the hands of the clock, which are synchronous with the\r\nevent. If an observer be stationed at B with a clock,—we should add that\r\nthe clock is of the same nature as the one at A,—he can estimate the\r\ntime of events occurring about B. But without further premises, it is\r\nnot possible to compare, as far as time is concerned, the events at B\r\nwith the events at A. We have hitherto an A-time, and a B-time, but no\r\ntime common to A and B. This last time (_i.e._, common time) can be\r\ndefined, if we establish by definition that the time which light\r\nrequires in travelling from A to B is equivalent to the time which light\r\nrequires in travelling from B to A. For example, a ray of light proceeds\r\nfrom A at A-time t_{A} towards B, arrives and is reflected from B at\r\nB-time t_{B}, and returns to A at A-time t′_{A}. According to the\r\ndefinition, both clocks are synchronous, if\r\n\r\n                      t_{B} - t_{A} = t′_{A} - t_{B}.\r\n\r\nWe assume that this definition of synchronism is possible without\r\ninvolving any inconsistency, for any number of points, therefore the\r\nfollowing relations hold:—\r\n\r\n1. If the clock at B be synchronous with the clock at A, then the clock\r\nat A is synchronous with the clock at B.\r\n\r\n2. If the clock at A as well as the clock at B are both synchronous with\r\nthe clock at C, then the clocks at A and B are synchronous.\r\n\r\nThus with the help of certain physical experiences, we have established\r\nwhat we understand when we speak of clocks at rest at different\r\nstations, and synchronous with one another; and thereby we have arrived\r\nat a definition of synchronism and time.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with experience we shall assume that the magnitude\r\n\r\n$$ \\frac {2 \\overline{AB}}{t'_{A} - t_{A}} = c $$\r\n\r\nwhere _c_ is a universal constant.\r\n\r\nWe have defined time essentially with a clock at rest in a stationary\r\nsystem. On account of its adaptability to the stationary system, we call\r\nthe time defined in this way as “time of the stationary system.”\r\n\r\n\r\n               § 2. On the Relativity of Length and Time.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following reflections are based on the Principle of Relativity and\r\non the Principle of Constancy of the velocity of light, both of which we\r\ndefine in the following way:—\r\n\r\n1. The laws according to which the nature of physical systems alter are\r\nindependent of the manner in which these changes are referred to two\r\nco-ordinate systems which have a uniform translators motion relative to\r\neach other.\r\n\r\n2. Every ray of light moves in the “stationary co-ordinate system” with\r\nthe same velocity _c_, the velocity being independent of the condition\r\nwhether this ray of light is emitted by a body at rest or in motion.[6]\r\nTherefore\r\n\r\n                 velocity = Path of Light/Interval of time,\r\n\r\nwhere, by ‘interval of time’ we mean time as defined in §1.\r\n\r\nLet us have a rigid rod at rest; this has a length _l_, when measured by\r\na measuring rod at rest; we suppose that the axis of the rod is laid\r\nalong the X-axis of the system at rest, and then a uniform velocity _v_,\r\nparallel to the axis of X, is imparted to it. Let us now enquire about\r\nthe length of the moving rod; this can be obtained by either of these\r\noperations.—\r\n\r\n(_a_) The observer provided with the measuring rod moves along with the\r\nrod to be measured, and measures by direct superposition the length of\r\nthe rod:—just as if the observer, the measuring rod, and the rod to be\r\nmeasured were at rest.\r\n\r\n(_b_) The observer finds out, by means of clocks placed in a system at\r\nrest (the clocks being synchronous as defined in §1), the points of this\r\nsystem where the ends of the rod to be measured occur at a particular\r\ntime _t_. The distance between these two points, measured by the\r\npreviously used measuring rod, this time it being at rest, is a length,\r\nwhich we may call the “length of the rod.”\r\n\r\nAccording to the Principle of Relativity, the length found out by the\r\noperation _a_), which we may call “the length of the rod in the moving\r\nsystem” is equal to the length _l_ of the rod in the stationary system.\r\n\r\nThe length which is found out by the second method, may be called ‘_the\r\nlength of the moving rod measured from the stationary system_.’ This\r\nlength is to be estimated on the basis of our principle, and _we shall\r\nfind it to be different from l_.\r\n\r\nIn the generally recognised kinematics, we silently assume that the\r\nlengths defined by these two operations are equal, or in other words,\r\nthat at an epoch of time _t_, a moving rigid body is geometrically\r\nreplaceable by the same body, which can replace it in the condition of\r\nrest.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Relativity of Time.\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us suppose that the two clocks synchronous with the clocks in the\r\nsystem at rest are brought to the ends A, and B of a rod, _i.e._, the\r\ntime of the clocks correspond to the time of the stationary system at\r\nthe points where they happen to arrive; these clocks are therefore\r\nsynchronous in the stationary system.\r\n\r\nWe further imagine that there are two observers at the two watches, and\r\nmoving with them, and that these observers apply the criterion for\r\nsynchronism to the two clocks. At the time _t__{A}, a ray of light goes\r\nout from A, is reflected from B at the time _t__{B}, and arrives back at\r\nA at time _t′__{A}. Taking into consideration the principle of,\r\nconstancy of the velocity of light, we have\r\n\r\n                      _t__{B} - _t__{A} = _r__{AB}/(_c_ - _v_),\r\n\r\n            and       _t′__{A} - _t__{B} = _r__{AB}/(_c_ + _v_),\r\n\r\nwhere _r__{AB} is the length of the moving rod, measured in the\r\nstationary system. Therefore the observers stationed with the watches\r\nwill not find the clocks synchronous, though the observer in the\r\nstationary system must declare the clocks to be synchronous. We\r\ntherefore see that we can attach no absolute significance to the concept\r\nof synchronism; but two events which are synchronous when viewed from\r\none system, will not be synchronous when viewed from a system moving\r\nrelatively to this system.\r\n\r\n\r\n  § 3. Theory of Co-ordinate and Time-Transformation from a stationary\r\nsystem to a system which moves relatively to this with uniform velocity.\r\n\r\n\r\nLet there be given, in the stationary system two co-ordinate systems,\r\n_i.e._, two series of three mutually perpendicular lines issuing from a\r\npoint. Let the X-axes of each coincide with one another, and the Y and\r\nZ-axes be parallel. Let a rigid measuring rod, and a number of clocks be\r\ngiven to each of the systems, and let the rods and clocks in each be\r\nexactly alike each other.\r\n\r\nLet the initial point of one of the systems (_k_) have a constant\r\nvelocity in the direction of the X-axis of the other which is stationary\r\nsystem K, the motion being also communicated to the rods and clocks in\r\nthe system (_k_). Any time _t_ of the stationary system K corresponds to\r\na definite position of the axes of the moving system, which are always\r\nparallel to the axes of the stationary system. By _t_, we always mean\r\nthe time in the stationary system.\r\n\r\nWe suppose that the space is measured by the stationary measuring rod\r\nplaced in the stationary system, as well as by the moving measuring rod\r\nplaced in the moving system, and we thus obtain the co-ordinates (_x_,\r\n_y_, _z_) for the stationary system, and (ξ, η, ζ) for the moving\r\nsystem. Let the time _t_ be determined for each point of the stationary\r\nsystem (which are provided with clocks) by means of the clocks which are\r\nplaced in the stationary system, with the help of light-signals as\r\ndescribed in § 1. Let also the time τ of the moving system be determined\r\nfor each point of the moving system (in which there are clocks which are\r\nat rest relative to the moving system), by means of the method of light\r\nsignals between these points (in which there are clocks) in the manner\r\ndescribed in § 1.\r\n\r\nTo every value of (_x_, _y_, _z_, _t_) which fully determines the\r\nposition and time of an event in the stationary system, there correspond\r\na system of values (ξ, η, ζ, τ); now the problem is to find out the\r\nsystem of equations connecting these magnitudes.\r\n\r\nPrimarily it is clear that on account of the property of homogeneity\r\nwhich we ascribe to time and space, the equations must be linear.\r\n\r\nIf we put _x′_ = _x_ - _vt_, then it is clear that at a point relatively\r\nat rest in the system _k_, we have a system of values (_x′_ _y_ _z_)\r\nwhich are independent of time. Now let us find out τ as a function of\r\n(_x′_, _y_, _z_, _t_). For this purpose we have to express in equations\r\nthe fact that τ is not other than the time given by the clocks which are\r\nat rest in the system _k_ which must be made synchronous in the manner\r\ndescribed in § 1.\r\n\r\nLet a ray of light be sent at time τ₀ from the origin of the system _k_\r\nalong the X-axis towards _x′_ and let it be reflected from that place at\r\ntime τ₁ towards the origin of moving co-ordinates and let it arrive\r\nthere at time τ₂; then we must have\r\n\r\n                              ½ (τ₀ + τ₂) = τ₁\r\n\r\nIf we now introduce the condition that τ is a function of co-ordinates,\r\nand apply the principle of constancy of the velocity of light in the\r\nstationary system, we have\r\n\r\n$$ \\frac {1}{2} (\\tau (0,0,0,t) + \\tau (0,0,0,(t + \\frac {x'}{c-v} +\r\n\\frac {x'}{c+v}))) $$\r\n\r\n$$ = \\tau (x',0,0, t + \\frac {x'}{c-v}) $$\r\n\r\nIt is to be noticed that instead of the origin of co-ordinates, we could\r\nselect some other point as the exit point for rays of light, and\r\ntherefore the above equation holds for all values of (_x′_, _y_, _z_,\r\n_t_,).\r\n\r\nA similar conception, being applied to the _y_- and _z_-axis gives us,\r\nwhen we take into consideration the fact that light when viewed from the\r\nstationary system, is always propagated along those axes with the\r\nvelocity √(_c²_ - _v²_), we have the questions\r\n\r\n                             ∂τ        ∂τ\r\n                            ---- = 0, ---- = 0.\r\n                             ∂y        ∂z\r\n\r\nFrom these equations it follows that τ is a linear function of _x′_ and\r\n_t_. From equations (1) we obtain\r\n\r\n                                         vx′\r\n                           τ = a (t - -------- )\r\n                                       c² - v²\r\n\r\nwhere _a_ is an unknown function of _v_.\r\n\r\nWith the help of these results it is easy to obtain the magnitudes (ξ,\r\nη, ζ) if we express by means of equations the fact that light, when\r\nmeasured in the moving system is always propagated with the constant\r\nvelocity _c_ (as the principle of constancy of light velocity in\r\nconjunction with the principle of relativity requires). For a time τ =\r\n0, if the ray is sent in the direction of increasing ξ, we have\r\n\r\n                                                  _vx′_\r\n              ξ = _c_τ, _i.e._ ξ = _a c_(_t_ - ------------ )\r\n                                                _c²_ - _v²_\r\n\r\nNow the ray of light moves relative to the origin of _k_ with a velocity\r\n_c_ - _v_, measured in the stationary system; therefore we have\r\n\r\n                                 _x′_\r\n                              ---------- = _t_\r\n                               _c_ - _v_\r\n\r\nSubstituting these values of _t_ in the equation for ξ, we obtain\r\n\r\n                                     _c²_\r\n                         ξ = _a_ ------------- _x′_\r\n                                  _c²_ - _v²_\r\n\r\nIn an analogous manner, we obtain by considering the ray of light which\r\nmoves along the _y_-axis,\r\n\r\n                                              _vx′_\r\n                   η = _c_τ = _a c_(_t_ - ------------- )\r\n                                           _c²_ - _v²_\r\n\r\nwhere\r\n\r\n                          _y_\r\n                    ------------------ = _t_, _x′_ = 0,\r\n                     √ (_c²_ - _v²_)\r\n\r\nTherefore\r\n\r\n                                      _c_\r\n                      η = _a_ ------------------ _y_,\r\n                               √ (_c²_ - _v²_)\r\n\r\n                                      _c_\r\n                      ζ = _a_ ----------------- _z_ .\r\n                                √ (_c²_ - _v²_)\r\n\r\nIf for _x′_, we substitute its value _x_ - _tv_, we obtain\r\n\r\n                                            _v_._c_\r\n                    τ = φ (_v_). β (_t_ - ----------- ,\r\n                                                c²\r\n\r\n                    ξ = φ (_v_). β (_x_ - _vt_) ,\r\n\r\n                    η = φ (_v_) _y_\r\n\r\n                    ζ = φ (_v_) _z_ ,\r\n\r\nwhere\r\n\r\n$$ \\beta = \\frac {1}{\\sqrt {1 - \\frac {v^2}{c^2}}} $$\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n                 φ (_v_) = _ac_ / √ (_c²_ - _v²_) = _a_ / β\r\n\r\nis a function of _v_.\r\n\r\nIf we make no assumption about the initial position of the moving system\r\nand about the null-point of _t_, then an additive constant is to be\r\nadded to the right hand side.\r\n\r\nWe have now to show, that every ray of light moves in the moving system\r\nwith a velocity _c_ (when measured in the moving system), in case, as we\r\nhave actually assumed, _c_ is also the velocity in the stationary\r\nsystem; for we have not as yet adduced any proof in support of the\r\nassumption that the principle of relativity is reconcilable with the\r\nprinciple of constant light-velocity.\r\n\r\nAt a time τ = _t_ = 0 let a spherical wave be sent out from the common\r\norigin of the two systems of co-ordinates, and let it spread with a\r\nvelocity _c_ in the system K. If (_x_, _y_, _z_), be a point reached by\r\nthe wave, we have\r\n\r\n                       _x²_ + _y²_ + _z²_ = _c²__t²_\r\n\r\nwith the aid of our transformation-equations, let us transform this\r\nequation, and we obtain by a simple calculation,\r\n\r\n                           ξ² + η² + ζ² = _c²_τ².\r\n\r\nTherefore the wave is propagated in the moving system with the same\r\nvelocity _c_, and as a spherical wave.[7] Therefore we show that the two\r\nprinciples are mutually reconcilable.\r\n\r\nIn the transformations we have got an undetermined function φ(_v_), and\r\nwe now proceed to find it out.\r\n\r\nLet us introduce for this purpose a third co-ordinate system _k′_, which\r\nis set in motion relative to the system _k_, the motion being parallel\r\nto the ξ-axis. Let the velocity of the origin be (-_v_). At the time _t_\r\n= 0, all the initial co-ordinate points coincide, and for _t_ = _x_ =\r\n_y_ = _z_ = 0, the time _t′_ of the system _k′_ = 0. We shall say that\r\n(_x′_ _y′_ _z′_ _t′_) are the co-ordinates measured in the system _k′_,\r\nthen by a two-fold application of the transformation-equations, we\r\nobtain\r\n\r\n                                               _v_\r\n                      τ′ = φ(-_v_)β(-_v_){τ + ----- ξ}\r\n                                               _c²_\r\n                           = φ(_v_)φ(-_v_)t,\r\n\r\n                      _x′_ = φ](_v_)β(_v_)(ξ + _v_τ)\r\n                           = φ(_v_)φ(-_v_)_x_, etc.\r\n\r\nSince the relations between (_x′_, _y′_, _z′_, _t′_), and (_x_, _y_,\r\n_z_, _t_) do not contain time explicitly, therefore K and _k′_ are\r\nrelatively at rest.\r\n\r\nIt appears that the systems K and _k′_ are identical.\r\n\r\n                            ∴ φ(_v_)φ(-_v_) = 1.\r\n\r\nLet us now turn our attention to the part of the ξ-axis between (ξ = 0,\r\nη = 0, ζ = 0), and (ξ = 0, η = 1, ζ = 0). Let this piece of the _y_-axis\r\nbe covered with a rod moving with the velocity _v_ relative to the\r\nsystem K and perpendicular to its axis;—the ends of the rod having\r\ntherefore the co-ordinates\r\n\r\n                 _x₁_ = _vt_, _y₁_ = _l_ / φ(_v_), _z₁_ = 0\r\n\r\n                 _x₂_ = _vt_, _y₂_ = 0, _z₂_ = 0\r\n\r\nTherefore the length of the rod measured in the system K is _l_/φ(_v_).\r\nFor the system moving with velocity (-_v_), we have on grounds of\r\nsymmetry,\r\n\r\n                       _l_         _l_\r\n                     -------- = ---------\r\n                      φ(_v_)     φ(-_v_)\r\n\r\n                     ∴ φ(_v_) = φ(-_v_), ∴ φ(_v_) = 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n  § 4. The physical significance of the equations obtained concerning\r\n                 moving rigid bodies and moving clocks.\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us consider a rigid sphere (_i.e._, one having a spherical figure\r\nwhen tested in the stationary system) of radius R which is at rest\r\nrelative to the system (K), and whose centre coincides with the origin\r\nof K then the equation of the surface of this sphere, which is moving\r\nwith a velocity _v_ relative to K, is\r\n\r\n                             ξ² + η² + ζ² = R².\r\n\r\nAt time _t_ = 0, the equation is expressed by means of (_x_, _y_, _z_,\r\n_t_,) as\r\n\r\n$$ \\frac {x^2}{(\\sqrt {1 - \\frac {v_2}{c_2}})^2} + y^2 + z^2 = R^2. $$\r\n\r\nA rigid body which has the figure of a sphere when measured in the\r\nmoving system, has therefore in the moving condition—when considered\r\nfrom the stationary system, the figure of a rotational ellipsoid with\r\nsemi-axes\r\n\r\n$$ R \\sqrt {1 - \\frac {v^2}{c^2}}, R, R. $$\r\n\r\nTherefore the _y_ and _z_ dimensions of the sphere (therefore of any\r\nfigure also) do not appear to be modified by the motion, but the _x_\r\ndimension is shortened in the ratio\r\n\r\n$$ 1 : \\sqrt {1 - \\frac {v^2}{c^2}}; $$\r\n\r\nthe shortening is the larger, the larger is _v_. For _v_ = _c_, all\r\nmoving bodies, when considered from a stationary system shrink into\r\nplanes. For a velocity larger than the velocity of light, our\r\npropositions become meaningless; in our theory _c_ plays the part of\r\ninfinite velocity.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that similar results hold about stationary bodies in a\r\nstationary system when considered from a uniformly moving system.\r\n\r\nLet us now consider that a clock which is lying at rest in the\r\nstationary system gives the time _t_, and lying at rest relative to the\r\nmoving system is capable of giving the time τ; suppose it to be placed\r\nat the origin of the moving system _k_, and to be so arranged that it\r\ngives the time τ. How much does the clock gain, when viewed from the\r\nstationary system K? We have,\r\n\r\n$$ \\tau = \\frac {1}{\\sqrt {1-\\frac {v^2}{c^2}}} (t - \\frac {v}{c^2}x),\r\n$$\r\n\r\nand _x_ = _vt_,\r\n\r\n$$ \\therefore \\tau - t = (1 - \\sqrt {1 - \\frac {v^2}{c^2}}) t. $$\r\n\r\nTherefore the clock loses by an amount ½(_v²_/_c²_) per second of\r\nmotion, to the second order of approximation.\r\n\r\nFrom this, the following peculiar consequence follows. Suppose at two\r\npoints A and B of the stationary system two clocks are given which are\r\nsynchronous in the sense explained in § 3 when viewed from the\r\nstationary system. Suppose the clock at A to be set in motion in the\r\nline joining it with B, then after the arrival of the clock at B, they\r\nwill no longer be found synchronous, but the clock which was set in\r\nmotion from A will lag behind the clock which had been all along at B by\r\nan amount ½_t_(_v²_/_c²_), where _t_ is the time required for the\r\njourney.\r\n\r\nWe see forthwith that the result holds also when the clock moves from A\r\nto B by a polygonal line, and also when A and B coincide.\r\n\r\nIf we assume that the result obtained for a polygonal line holds also\r\nfor a curved line, we obtain the following law. If at A, there be two\r\nsynchronous clocks, and if we set in motion one of them with a constant\r\nvelocity along a closed curve till it comes back to A, the journey being\r\ncompleted in _t_-seconds, then after arrival, the last mentioned clock\r\nwill be behind the stationary one by ½_t_(_v²_/_c²_) seconds. From this,\r\nwe conclude that a clock placed at the equator must be slower by a very\r\nsmall amount than a similarly constructed clock which is placed at the\r\npole, all other conditions being identical.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  § 5. Addition-Theorem of Velocities.\r\n\r\n\r\nLet a point move in the system _k_ (which moves with velocity _v_ along\r\nthe _x_-axis of the system K) according to the equation\r\n\r\n$$ \\xi = w_{\\xi} \\tau, \\eta = w_{\\eta} \\tau, \\zeta = 0, $$\r\n\r\nwhere _w__{ξ} and _w__{η} are constants.\r\n\r\nIt is required to find out the motion of the point relative to the\r\nsystem K. If we now introduce the system of equations in § 3 in the\r\nequation of motion of the point, we obtain\r\n\r\n$$ x = (\\frac {w_{\\xi} + v}{1+\\frac {vw_{\\xi}}{c^2}}) t $$,\r\n\r\n$$ y = \\frac {(1-\\frac {v^2}{c^2})^{\\frac {1}{2}} w_{\\eta}t} {1+\\frac\r\n{vw_{\\xi}}{c^2}} $$ ,\r\n\r\nz = 0 .\r\n\r\nThe law of parallelogram of velocities hold up to the first order of\r\napproximation. We can put\r\n\r\n$$ U^2 = (\\frac {\\partial x}{\\partial t})^2 + (\\frac {\\partial\r\ny}{\\partial t})^2 $$ ,\r\n\r\n$$ w^2 = w_{\\xi}^2 + w_{\\eta}^2 $$ ,\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n$$ \\alpha = tan^{-1} \\frac {w}{w_{\\xi}} $$\r\n\r\n_i.e._, α is put equal to the angle between the velocities _v_, and _w_.\r\nThen we have—\r\n\r\n$$ U = \\frac {[(v^2 + w^2 + 2 vw \\cos \\alpha) - (\\frac {vw \\sin\r\n\\alpha}{c})^2]^{\\frac {1}{2}}} {1 + \\frac {vw \\cos \\alpha}{c^2}} $$\r\n\r\nIt should be noticed that _v_ and _w_ enter into the expression for\r\nvelocity symmetrically. If _w_ has the direction of the ξ-axis of the\r\nmoving system,\r\n\r\n$$ U = \\frac {v + w}{1 + \\frac {vw}{c^2}} $$\r\n\r\nFrom this equation, we see that by combining two velocities, each of\r\nwhich is smaller than _c_, we obtain a velocity which is always smaller\r\nthan _c_. If we put _v_ = _c_ - χ, and _w_ = _c_ - λ, where χ and λ are\r\neach smaller than _c_,[8]\r\n\r\n$$ U = c \\frac {2c - \\chi - \\lambda}{2c - \\chi - \\lambda + \\frac {\\chi\r\n\\lambda}{c^2}} < c $$\r\n\r\nIt is also clear that the velocity of light _c_ cannot be altered by\r\nadding to it a velocity smaller than _c_.

Let us have a point-mass of electricity which is of magnitude\r\nunity in the stationary system K, _i.e._, it exerts a unit force upon a\r\nsimilar quantity placed at a distance of 1 cm. If this quantity of\r\nelectricity be at rest in the stationary system, then the force acting\r\nupon it is equivalent to the vector (X, Y, Z) of electric force. But if\r\nthe quantity of electricity be at rest relative to the moving system (at\r\nleast for the moment considered), then the force acting upon it, and\r\nmeasured in the moving system is equivalent to the vector (X′, Y′, Z′).\r\nThe first three of equations (1), (2), (3), can be expressed in the\r\nfollowing way:—\r\n\r\n1. If a point-mass of electric unit pole moves in an electro-magnetic\r\nfield, then besides the electric force, an electromotive force acts upon\r\nit, which, neglecting the numbers involving the second and higher powers\r\nof _v_/_c_, is equivalent to the vector-product of the velocity vector,\r\nand the magnetic force divided by the velocity of light (Old mode of\r\nexpression).\r\n\r\n2. If a point-mass of electric unit pole moves in an electro-magnetic\r\nfield, then the force acting upon it is equivalent to the electric force\r\nexisting at the position of the unit pole, which we obtain by the\r\ntransformation of the field to a co-ordinate system which is at rest\r\nrelative to the electric unit pole [New mode of expression].\r\n\r\nSimilar theorems hold with reference to the magnetic force. We see that\r\nin the theory developed the electro-magnetic force plays the part of an\r\nauxiliary concept, which owes its introduction in theory to the\r\ncircumstance that the electric and magnetic forces possess no existence\r\nindependent of the nature of motion of the co-ordinate system.\r\n\r\nIt is further clear that the asymmetry mentioned in the introduction\r\nwhich occurs when we treat of the current excited by the relative motion\r\nof a magnet and a conductor disappears. Also the question about the seat\r\nof electromagnetic energy is seen to be without any meaning.\r\n\r\n\r\n           § 7. Theory of Döppler’s Principle and Aberration.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the system K, at a great distance from the origin of co-ordinates,\r\nlet there be a source of electrodynamic waves, which is represented with\r\nsufficient approximation in a part of space not containing the origin,\r\nby the equations:—\r\n\r\n                         X = X₀ sin Φ\r\n                         Y = Y₀ sin Φ\r\n                         Z = Z₀ sin Φ\r\n                         L = L₀ sin Φ\r\n                         M = M₀ sin Φ\r\n                         N = N₀ sin Φ\r\n                                    lx + my + nz\r\n                         Φ = ω(t -  ------------ )\r\n                                          c\r\n\r\nHere (X₀, Y₀, Z₀) and (L₀, M₀, N₀) are the vectors which determine the\r\namplitudes of the train of waves, (_l_, _m_, _n_) are the\r\ndirection-cosines of the wave-normal.\r\n\r\nLet us now ask ourselves about the composition of these waves, when they\r\nare investigated by an observer at rest in a moving medium _k_:—By\r\napplying the equations of transformation obtained in §6 for the electric\r\nand magnetic forces, and the equations of transformation obtained in § 3\r\nfor the co-ordinates, and time, we obtain immediately:—\r\n\r\n                       X′ = X₀ sin Φ′\r\n\r\n                                   v\r\n                       Y′ = β(Y₀ - --- N₀) sin Φ′\r\n                                   c\r\n\r\n                                   v\r\n                       Z′ = β(Z₀ - --- M₀) sin Φ′\r\n                                   c\r\n\r\n                       L′ = L₀ sin Φ′\r\n\r\n                                   v\r\n                       M′ = β(M₀ - --- Z₀) sin Φ′\r\n                                   c\r\n\r\n                                   v\r\n                       N′ = β(N₀ - --- Y₀) sin Φ′\r\n                                   c\r\n\r\n                                    l′ξ + m′η + n′ζ\r\n                       Φ′ = ω′(t -  --------------- )\r\n                                           c\r\n\r\nwhere\r\n\r\n$$ \\omega' = \\omega \\beta (1 - \\frac {lv}{c}) $$ ,\r\n\r\n$$ l' = \\frac {l - \\frac {v}{c}}{1 - \\frac {lv}{c}} $$ ,\r\n\r\n$$ m' = \\frac {m}{\\beta (1 - \\frac {lv}{c})} $$ ,\r\n\r\n$$ n' = \\frac {n}{\\beta (1 - \\frac {lv}{c})} $$\r\n\r\nFrom the equation for ω′ it follows:—If an observer moves with the\r\nvelocity _v_ relative to an infinitely distant source of light emitting\r\nwaves of frequency ν, in such a manner that the line joining the source\r\nof light and the observer makes an angle of Φ with the velocity of the\r\nobserver referred to a system of co-ordinates which is stationary with\r\nregard to the source, then the frequency ν′ which is perceived by the\r\nobserver is represented by the formula\r\n\r\n$$ \\nu' = \\nu \\frac {1 - cos \\Phi \\frac {v}{c}} {\\sqrt {1 - \\frac\r\n{v^2}{c^2}}} $$\r\n\r\nThis is Döppler’s principle for any velocity. If Φ = 0, then the\r\nequation takes the simple form\r\n\r\n$$ \\nu' = \\nu (\\frac {1 - \\frac {v}{c}}{1 + \\frac {v}{c}})^{\\frac\r\n{1}{2}} $$\r\n\r\nWe see that—contrary to the usual conception—ν = ∞, for _v_ = -_c_.\r\n\r\nIf Φ′ = angle between the wave-normal (direction of the ray) in the\r\nmoving system, and the line of motion of the observer, the equation for\r\n_l´_ takes the form\r\n\r\n$$ \\cos \\Phi' = \\frac {\\cos \\Phi - \\frac {v}{c}} {1 - \\frac {v}{c} \\cos\r\n\\Phi} $$\r\n\r\nThis equation expresses the law of observation in its most general form.\r\nIf Φ = π/2, the equation takes the simple form\r\n\r\n                                          v\r\n                                cos Φ′ = ---\r\n                                          c\r\n\r\nWe have still to investigate the amplitude of the waves, which occur in\r\nthese equations. If A and A′ be the amplitudes in the stationary and the\r\nmoving systems (either electrical or magnetic), we have\r\n\r\n$$ A'^2 = A^2 \\frac {(1 - \\frac {v}{c} \\cos \\Phi)^2} {1 - \\frac\r\n{v^2}{c^2}} $$\r\n\r\nIf Φ = 0, this reduces to the simple form\r\n\r\n$$ A'^2 = A^2 \\frac {1 - \\frac {v}{c}} {1 + \\frac {v}{c}} $$\r\n\r\nFrom these equations, it appears that for an observer, which moves with\r\nthe velocity c towards the source of light, the source should appear\r\ninfinitely intense.\r\n\r\n\r\n § 8. Transformation of the Energy of the Rays of Light. Theory of the\r\n                Radiation-pressure on a perfect mirror.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince A²/8π is equal to the energy of light per unit volume, we have to\r\nregard A²/8π as the energy of light in the moving system. A′²/A² would\r\ntherefore denote the ratio between the energies of a definite\r\nlight-complex “measured when moving” and “measured when stationary,” the\r\nvolumes of the light-complex measured in K and _k_ being equal. Yet this\r\nis not the case. If _l_, _m_, _n_ are the direction-cosines of the\r\nwave-normal of light in the stationary system, then no energy passes\r\nthrough the surface elements of the spherical surface\r\n\r\n           (_x_ - _clt_)² + (_y_ - _cmt_)² + (_z_ - _cnt_)² = R²,\r\n\r\nwhich expands with the velocity of light. We can therefore say, that\r\nthis surface always encloses the same light-complex. Let us now consider\r\nthe quantity of energy, which this surface encloses, when regarded from\r\nthe system _k_, _i.e._, the energy of the light-complex relative to the\r\nsystem _k_.\r\n\r\nRegarded from the moving system, the spherical surface becomes an\r\nellipsoidal surface, having, at the time τ = 0, the equation:—\r\n\r\n$$ (\\beta \\xi - l \\beta \\frac {v}{c} \\xi)^2 + (\\eta - m \\beta \\frac\r\n{v}{c} \\xi)^2 + (\\zeta - n \\beta \\frac {v}{c} \\xi)^2 = R^2 $$\r\n\r\nIf S = volume of the sphere, S′ = volume of this ellipsoid, then a\r\nsimple calculation shows that:\r\n\r\n$$ \\frac {S'}{S} = \\frac {\\beta}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac {v}{c} \\cos \\Phi}} $$\r\n\r\nIf E denotes the quantity of light energy measured in the stationary\r\nsystem, E′ the quantity measured in the moving system, which are\r\nenclosed by the surfaces mentioned above, then\r\n\r\n$$ \\frac {E'}{E} = \\frac {\\frac {A'^2}{8\\pi} S'}{\\frac {A^2}{8\\pi}S} =\r\n\\frac {1 - \\frac {v}{c} \\cos \\Phi}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac {v^2}{c^2}}} $$\r\n\r\nIf Φ = 0, we have the simple formula:—\r\n\r\n$$ \\frac {E'}{E} = (\\frac{1 - \\frac{v}{c}}{1 +\r\n\\frac{v}{c}})^{\\frac{1}{2}} $$\r\n\r\nIt is to be noticed that the energy and the frequency of a light-complex\r\nvary according to the same law with the state of motion of the observer.\r\n\r\nLet there be a perfectly reflecting mirror at the co-ordinate-plane ξ =\r\n0, from which the plane-wave considered in the last paragraph is\r\nreflected. Let us now ask ourselves about the light-pressure exerted on\r\nthe reflecting surface and the direction, frequency, intensity of the\r\nlight after reflexion.\r\n\r\nLet the incident light be defined by the magnitudes A cos Φ, _v_\r\n(referred to the system K). Regarded from _k_, we have the corresponding\r\nmagnitudes:\r\n\r\n$$ A' = A \\frac{1 - \\frac{v}{c} \\cos \\Phi}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}\r\n$$\r\n\r\n$$ \\cos \\Phi' = \\frac{\\cos \\Phi - \\frac{v}{c}}{1 - \\frac{v}{c} \\cos\r\n\\Phi} $$\r\n\r\n$$ \\nu' = \\nu \\frac{1 - \\frac{v}{c} \\cos \\Phi}{\\sqrt{1 -\r\n\\frac{v^2}{c^2}}} $$\r\n\r\nFor the reflected light we obtain, when the process is referred to the\r\nsystem _k_:—\r\n\r\n                     A″ = A′, cos Φ″ = -cos Φ″, ν″ = ν′\r\n\r\nBy means of a back-transformation to the stationary system, we obtain K,\r\nfor the reflected light:—\r\n\r\n$$ A''' = A'' \\frac{1 + \\frac{v}{c}\\cos \\Phi''}{\\sqrt{1 -\r\n\\frac{v^2}{c^2}}} = A \\frac{1 - 2\\frac{v}{c} \\cos \\Phi +\r\n\\frac{v^2}{c^2}}{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}} $$ ,\r\n\r\n$$ \\cos \\Phi''' = \\frac{\\cos \\Phi'' + \\frac{v}{c}}{1 + \\frac{v}{c}\\cos\r\n\\Phi''} = - \\frac{(1 + \\frac{v^2}{c^2}) \\cos \\Phi - 2 \\frac{v}{c}} {1 -\r\n2 \\frac{v}{c} \\cos \\Phi + \\frac {v^2}{c^2}} $$ ,\r\n\r\n$$ \\nu''' = \\nu'' \\frac{1 + \\frac{v}{c} \\cos \\Phi''}{\\sqrt{1 -\r\n\\frac{v^2}{c^2}}} = \\nu \\frac{1 - 2 \\frac{v}{c} \\cos \\Phi +\r\n\\frac{v^2}{c^2}} {(1 - \\frac{v}{c})^2} $$\r\n\r\nThe amount or energy falling upon the unit surface of the mirror per\r\nunit of time (measured in the stationary system) is A²/(8π (c cos Φ -\r\n_v_)). The amount of energy going away from unit surface of the mirror\r\nper unit of time is A‴²/(8π (-c cos Φ″ + _v_)). The difference of these\r\ntwo expressions is, according to the Energy principle, the amount of\r\nwork exerted, by the pressure of light per unit of time. If we put this\r\nequal to P._v_, where P = pressure of light, we have\r\n\r\n$$ P = 2 \\frac{A^2}{8\\pi} \\frac{(\\cos \\Phi - \\frac{v}{c})^2} {1 -\r\n(\\frac{v}{c})^2} $$\r\n\r\nAs a first approximation, we obtain\r\n\r\n                                    A²\r\n                              P = 2 -- cos² Φ\r\n                                    8π\r\n\r\nwhich is in accordance with facts, and with other theories.\r\n\r\nAll problems of optics of moving bodies can be solved after the method\r\nused here. The essential point is, that the electric and magnetic forces\r\nof light, which are influenced by a moving body, should be transformed\r\nto a system of co-ordinates which is stationary relative to the body. In\r\nthis way, every problem of the optics of moving bodies would be reduced\r\nto a series of problems of the optics of stationary bodies.\r\n\r\n\r\n          § 9.

If we now suppose\r\nthat the electrical-masses are bound unchangeably to small, rigid bodies\r\n(Ions, electrons), then these equations form the electromagnetic basis\r\nof Lorentz’s electrodynamics and optics for moving bodies.\r\n\r\nIf these equations which hold in the system K, are transformed to the\r\nsystem _k_ with the aid of the transformation-equations given in § 3 and\r\n§ 6, then we obtain the equations:—\r\n\r\n$$ \\frac{1}{c} (\\rho' u_{\\xi} + \\frac{\\partial X'}{\\partial \\tau}) =\r\n\\frac{\\partial N'}{\\partial \\eta} - \\frac{\\partial M'}{\\partial \\zeta}\r\n$$ ,\r\n\r\n$$ \\frac{\\partial L'}{\\partial \\tau} = \\frac{\\partial Y'}{\\partial\r\n\\zeta} - \\frac{\\partial Z'}{\\partial \\eta} $$ ,\r\n\r\n$$ \\frac{1}{c} (\\rho' u_{\\eta} + \\frac{\\partial Y'}{\\partial \\tau}) =\r\n\\frac{\\partial L'}{\\partial \\zeta} - \\frac{\\partial N'}{\\partial \\xi} $$\r\n,\r\n\r\n$$ \\frac{\\partial M'}{\\partial \\tau} = \\frac{\\partial Z'}{\\partial \\xi}\r\n- \\frac{\\partial X'}{\\partial \\zeta} $$ ,\r\n\r\n$$ \\frac{1}{c} (\\rho' u_{\\zeta} + \\frac{\\partial Z'}{\\partial \\tau}) =\r\n\\frac{\\partial M'}{\\partial \\xi} - \\frac{\\partial L'}{\\partial \\eta} $$\r\n,\r\n\r\n$$ \\frac{\\partial N'}{\\partial \\tau} = \\frac{\\partial X'}{\\partial \\eta}\r\n- \\frac{\\partial Y'}{\\partial \\xi} $$ ,\r\n\r\nwhere\r\n\r\n$$ \\frac{u_{x} - v}{1 - \\frac{u_{x}v}{c}} = u_{\\xi} $$ ,\r\n\r\n$$ \\frac{u_{y}}{\\beta(1 - \\frac{vu_{x}}{c^2})} = u_{\\eta} $$ ,\r\n\r\n$$ \\rho' = \\frac{\\partial X'}{\\partial \\xi} + \\frac{\\partial\r\nY'}{\\partial \\eta} + \\frac{\\partial Z'}{\\partial \\xi} = \\beta(1 -\r\n\\frac{vu_{x}}{c^2}) \\rho $$ ,\r\n\r\n$$ \\frac{u_{x}}{\\beta(1 - \\frac{vu_{x}}{c^2})} = u_{\\zeta} $$ ,\r\n\r\nSince the vector (_u__{ξ}, _u__{η}, _u__{ζ}) is nothing but the velocity\r\nof the electrical mass measured in the system _k_, as can be easily seen\r\nfrom the addition-theorem of velocities in § 4—so it is hereby shown,\r\nthat by taking our kinematical principle as the basis, the\r\nelectromagnetic basis of Lorentz’s theory of electrodynamics of moving\r\nbodies correspond to the relativity-postulate. It can be briefly\r\nremarked here that the following important law follows easily from the\r\nequations developed in the present section:—if an electrically charged\r\nbody moves in any manner in space, and if its charge does not change\r\nthereby, when regarded from a system moving along with it, then the\r\ncharge remains constant even when it is regarded from the stationary\r\nsystem K.\r\n\r\n\r\n          § 10. Dynamics of the Electron (slowly accelerated).\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us suppose that a point-shaped particle, having the electrical\r\ncharge _e_ (to be called henceforth the electron) moves in the\r\nelectromagnetic field; we assume the following about its law of motion.\r\n\r\nIf the electron be at rest at any definite epoch, then in the next\r\n“_particle of time_,” the motion takes place according to the equations\r\n\r\n                _d²x_             _d²y_             _d²z_\r\n            _m_ ----- = _e_X, _m_ ----- = _e_Y, _m_ ----- = _e_Z\r\n                _dt²_             _dt²_              _dt²_\r\n\r\nWhere (_x_, _y_, _z_) are the co-ordinates of the electron, and _m_ is\r\nits mass.\r\n\r\nLet the electron possess the velocity _v_ at a certain epoch of time.\r\nLet us now investigate the laws according to which the electron will\r\nmove in the ‘particle of time’ immediately following this epoch.\r\n\r\nWithout influencing the generality of treatment, we can and we will\r\nassume that, at the moment we are considering, the electron is at the\r\norigin of co-ordinates, and moves with the velocity _v_ along the X-axis\r\nof the system. It is clear that at this moment (_t_ = 0) the electron is\r\nat rest relative to the system _k_, which moves parallel to the X-axis\r\nwith the constant velocity _v_.\r\n\r\nFrom the suppositions made above, in combination with the principle of\r\nrelativity, it is clear that regarded from the system _k_, the electron\r\nmoves according to the equations\r\n\r\n             _d²_ξ              _d²_η              _d²_ζ\r\n         _m_ ----- = _e_X′, _m_ ----- = _e_Y′, _m_ ----- = _e_Z′ ,\r\n             _d_τ²              _d_τ²              _d_τ²\r\n\r\nin the time immediately following the moment, where the symbols (ξ, η,\r\nζ, τ, X’, Y’, Z’) refer to the system _k_. If we now fix, that for _t_ =\r\n_v_ = _y_ = _z_ = 0, τ = ξ = η = ζ = 0, then the equations of\r\ntransformation given in § 3 (and § 6) hold, and we have:\r\n\r\n                    _v_\r\n        τ = β(_t_ - ---- _x_), ξ = β(_x_ - _vt_), η = _y_, ζ = _z_,\r\n                    _c²_\r\n\r\n                           _v_                _v_\r\n        X′ = X, Y′ = β(Y - --- N), Z′ = β(Z + --- M)\r\n                           _c_                _c_\r\n\r\nWith the aid of these equations, we can transform the above equations of\r\nmotion from the system _k_ to the system K, and obtain:—\r\n\r\n(A)\r\n\r\n$$ \\frac{d^2 x}{dt^2} = \\frac{e}{m} \\frac{1}{\\beta} X $$ ,\r\n\r\n$$ \\frac{d^2 y}{dt^2} = \\frac{e}{m} \\frac{1}{\\beta} (Y - \\frac{v}{c} N)\r\n$$ ,\r\n\r\n$$ \\frac{d^2 z}{dt^2} = \\frac{e}{m} \\frac{1}{\\beta} (Z + \\frac{v}{c} M)\r\n$$\r\n\r\nLet us now consider, following the usual method of treatment, the\r\nlongitudinal and transversal mass of a moving electron. We write the\r\nequations (A) in the form\r\n\r\n                         _d²x_\r\n                   _m_β² ----- = _e_X = _e_X′\r\n                         _dt²_\r\n\r\n                         _d²y_             _v_\r\n                   _m_β² ----- = _e_β (Y - --- N) = _e_Y′\r\n                         _dt²_             _c_\r\n\r\n                         _d²z_             _v_\r\n                   _m_β² ----- = _e_β (Z - --- M) = _e_Z′\r\n                         _dt²_             _c_\r\n\r\nand let us first remark, that _e_X′, _e_Y′, _e_Z′ are the components of\r\nthe ponderomotive force acting upon the electron, and are considered in\r\na moving system which, at this moment, moves with a velocity which is\r\nequal to that of the electron. This force can, for example, be measured\r\nby means of a spring-balance which is at rest in this last system. If we\r\nbriefly call this force as “the force acting upon the electron,” and\r\nmaintain the equation:—\r\n\r\nMass-number × acceleration-number = force-number, and if we further fix\r\nthat the accelerations are measured in the stationary system K, then\r\nfrom the above equations, we obtain:—\r\n\r\nLongitudinal mass:\r\n\r\n$$ \\frac{m}{(\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}})^{\\frac{3}{2}}} $$\r\n\r\nTransversal mass:\r\n\r\n$$ \\frac{m}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}} $$\r\n\r\nNaturally, when other definitions are given of the force and the\r\nacceleration, other numbers are obtained for the mass; hence we see that\r\nwe must proceed very carefully in comparing the different theories of\r\nthe motion of the electron.\r\n\r\nWe remark that this result about the mass hold also for ponderable\r\nmaterial mass; for in our sense, a ponderable material point may be made\r\ninto an electron by the addition of an electrical charge which may be as\r\nsmall as possible.\r\n\r\nLet us now determine the kinetic energy of the electron. If the electron\r\nmoves from the origin of co-ordinates of the system K with the initial\r\nvelocity 0 steadily along the X-axis under the action of an\r\nelectromotive force X, then it is clear that the energy drawn from the\r\nelectrostatic field has the value ∫_e_X_dx_. Since the electron is only\r\nslowly accelerated, and in consequence, no energy is given out in the\r\nform of radiation, therefore the energy drawn from the electro-static\r\nfield may be put equal to the energy W of motion. Considering the whole\r\nprocess of motion in questions, the first of equations A) holds, we\r\nobtain:—\r\n\r\n$$ W = \\int eXdx = \\int_0^v m\\beta^3 vdv = mc^2 (\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 -\r\n\\frac{v^2}{c^2}}} - 1) $$\r\n\r\nFor _v_ = _c_, W is infinitely great. As our former result shows,\r\nvelocities exceeding that of light can have no possibility of existence.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the arguments mentioned above, this expression for\r\nkinetic energy must also hold for ponderable masses.\r\n\r\nWe can now enumerate the characteristics of the motion of the electrons\r\navailable for experimental verification, which follow from equations A).\r\n\r\n1. From the second of equations A), it follows that an electrical force\r\nY, and a magnetic force N produce equal deflexions of an electron moving\r\nwith the velocity _v_, when Y = N_v_/_c_. Therefore we see that\r\naccording to our theory, it is possible to obtain the velocity of an\r\nelectron from the ratio of the magnetic deflexion A_{_m_}, and the\r\nelectric deflexion A_{_e_}, by applying the law:—\r\n\r\n$$ \\frac{A_{m}}{A_{e}} = \\frac{v}{c} $$\r\n\r\nThis relation can be tested by means of experiments because the velocity\r\nof the electron can be directly measured by means of rapidly oscillating\r\nelectric and magnetic fields.\r\n\r\n2. From the value which is deduced for the kinetic energy of the\r\nelectron, it follows that when the electron falls through a potential\r\ndifference of P, the velocity _v_ which is acquired is given by the\r\nfollowing relation:—\r\n\r\n$$ P = \\int Xdx = \\frac{m}{e}c^2 (\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}} -\r\n1) $$\r\n\r\n3. We calculate the radius of curvature R of the path, where the only\r\ndeflecting force is a magnetic force N acting perpendicular to the\r\nvelocity of projection. From the second of equations A) we obtain:\r\n\r\n$$ - \\frac{d^2y}{dt^2} = \\frac{v^2}{R} = \\frac{e}{m} \\frac{v}{c} N\r\n\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}} $$\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n                                    _mv_β_c_\r\n                               R = ----------\r\n                                      _e_N\r\n\r\nThese three relations are complete expressions for the law of motion of\r\nthe electron according to the above theory.\r\n\r\nFootnote 6:\r\n\r\n  _Vide_ Note 9.\r\n\r\nFootnote 7:\r\n\r\n  _Vide_ Note 9.\r\n\r\nFootnote 8:\r\n\r\n  _Vide_ Note 12.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           ALBRECHT EINSTEIN\r\n                     [_A short biographical note._]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe name of Prof. Albrecht Einstein has now spread far beyond the narrow\r\npale of scientific investigators owing to the brilliant confirmation of\r\nhis predicted deflection of light-rays by the gravitational field of the\r\nsun during the total solar eclipse of May 29, 1919. But to the serious\r\nstudent of science, he has been known from the beginning of the current\r\ncentury, and many dark problems in physics has been illuminated with the\r\nlustre of his genius, before, owing to the latest sensation just\r\nmentioned, he flashes out before public imagination as a scientific star\r\nof the first magnitude.\r\n\r\nEinstein is a Swiss-German of Jewish extraction, and began his\r\nscientific career as a privat-dozent in the Swiss University of Zürich\r\nabout the year 1902. Later on, he migrated to the German University of\r\nPrague in Bohemia as ausser-ordentliche (or associate) Professor. In\r\n1914, through the exertions of Prof. M. Planck of the Berlin University,\r\nhe was appointed a paid member of the Royal (now National) Prussian\r\nAcademy of Sciences, on a salary of 18,000 marks per year. In this post,\r\nhe has only to do and guide research work. Another distinguished\r\noccupant of the same post was Van’t Hoff, the eminent physical chemist.\r\n\r\nIt is rather difficult to give a detailed, and consistent chronological\r\naccount of his scientific activities,—they are so variegated, and cover\r\nsuch a wide field. The first work which gained him distinction was an\r\ninvestigation on Brownian Movement. An admirable account will be found\r\nin Perrin’s book ‘The Atoms.’ Starting from Boltzmann’s theorem\r\nconnecting the entropy, and the probability of a state, he deduced a\r\nformula on the mean displacement of small particles (colloidal)\r\nsuspended in a liquid. This formula gives us one of the best methods for\r\nfinding out a very fundamental number in physics—namely—the number of\r\nmolecules in one gm. molecule of gas (Avogadro’s number). The formula\r\nwas shortly afterwards verified by Perrin, Prof. of Chemical Physics in\r\nthe Sorbonne, Paris.\r\n\r\nTo Einstein is also due the resuscitation of Planck’s quantum theory of\r\nenergy-emission. This theory has not yet caught the popular imagination\r\nto the same extent as the new theory of Time, and Space, but it is none\r\nthe less iconoclastic in its scope as far as classical concepts are\r\nconcerned. It was known for a long time that the observed emission of\r\nlight from a heated black body did not correspond to the formula which\r\ncould be deduced from the older classical theories of continuous\r\nemission and propagation. In the year 1900, Prof. Planck of the Berlin\r\nUniversity worked out a formula which was based on the bold assumption\r\nthat energy was emitted and absorbed by the molecules in multiples of\r\nthe quantity _h_ν, where _h_ is a constant (which is universal like the\r\nconstant of gravitation), and ν is the frequency of the light.\r\n\r\nThe conception was so radically different from all accepted theories\r\nthat in spite of the great success of Planck’s radiation formula in\r\nexplaining the observed facts of black-body radiation, it did not meet\r\nwith much favour from the physicists. In fact, some one remarked\r\njocularly that according to Planck, energy flies out of a radiator like\r\na swarm of gnats.\r\n\r\nBut Einstein found a support for the new-born concept in another\r\ndirection. It was known that if green or ultraviolet light was allowed\r\nto fall on a plate of some alkali metal, the plate lost electrons. The\r\nelectrons were emitted with all velocities, but there is generally a\r\nmaximum limit. From the investigations of Lenard and Ladenburg, the\r\ncurious discovery was made that this maximum velocity of emission did\r\nnot at all depend upon the intensity of light, but upon its wavelength.\r\nThe more violet was the light, the greater was the velocity of emission.\r\n\r\nTo account for this fact, Einstein made the bold assumption that the\r\nlight is propagated in space as a unit pulse (he calls it a Light-cell),\r\nand falling upon an individual atom, liberates electrons according to\r\nthe energy equation\r\n\r\n                                   1\r\n                           _h_ν = --- _mv²_ + A,\r\n                                   2\r\n\r\nwhere (_m_, _v_) are the mass and velocity of the electron. A is a\r\nconstant characteristic of the metal plate.\r\n\r\nThere was little material for the confirmation of this law when it was\r\nfirst proposed (1905), and eleven years elapsed before Prof. Millikan\r\nestablished, by a set of experiments scarcely rivalled for the\r\ningenuity, skill, and care displayed, the absolute truth of the law. As\r\nresults of this confirmation, and other brilliant triumphs, the quantum\r\nlaw is now regarded as a fundamental law of Energetics. In recent years,\r\nX-rays have been added to the domain of light, and in this direction\r\nalso, Einstein’s photo-electric formula has proved to be one of the most\r\nfruitful conceptions in Physics.\r\n\r\nThe quantum law was next extended by Einstein to the problems of\r\ndecrease of specific heat at low temperature, and here also his theory\r\nwas confirmed in a brilliant manner.\r\n\r\nWe pass over his other contributions to the equation of state, to the\r\nproblems of null-point energy, and photo-chemical reactions. The recent\r\nexperimental works of Nernst and Warburg seem to indicate that through\r\nEinstein’s genius, we are probably for the first time having a\r\nsatisfactory theory of photo-chemical action.\r\n\r\nIn 1915, Einstein made an excursion into Experimental Physics, and here\r\nalso, in his characteristic way, he tackled one of the most fundamental\r\nconcepts of Physics. It is well-known that according to Ampere, the\r\nmagnetisation of iron and iron-like bodies, when placed within a coil\r\ncarrying an electric current is due to the excitation in the metal of\r\nsmall electrical circuits. But the conception though a very fruitful\r\none, long remained without a trace of experimental proof, though after\r\nthe discovery of the electron, it was generally believed that these\r\nmolecular currents may be due to the rotational motion of free electrons\r\nwithin the metal. It is easily seen that if in the process of\r\nmagnetisation, a number of electrons be set into rotatory motion, then\r\nthese will impart to the metal itself a turning couple. The experiment\r\nis a rather difficult one, and many physicists tried in vain to observe\r\nthe effect. But in collaboration with de Haas, Einstein planned and\r\nsuccessfully carried out this experiment, and proved the essential\r\ncorrectness of Ampere’s views.\r\n\r\nEinstein’s studies on Relativity were commenced in the year 1905, and\r\nhas been continued up to the present time. The first paper in the\r\npresent collection forms Einstein’s first great contribution to the\r\nPrinciple of Special Relativity. We have recounted in the introduction\r\nhow out of the chaos and disorder into which the electrodynamics and\r\noptics of moving bodies had fallen previous to 1895, Lorentz, Einstein\r\nand Minkowski have succeeded in building up a consistent, and fruitful\r\nnew theory of Time and Space.\r\n\r\nBut Einstein was not satisfied with the study of the special problem of\r\nRelativity for uniform motion, but tried, in a series of papers\r\nbeginning from 1911, to extend it to the case of non-uniform motion. The\r\nlast paper in the present collection is a translation of a comprehensive\r\narticle which he contributed to the Annalen der Physik in 1916 on this\r\nsubject, and gives, in his own words, the Principles of Generalized\r\nRelativity. The triumphs of this theory are now matters of public\r\nknowledge.\r\n\r\nEinstein is now only 45, and it is to be hoped that science will\r\ncontinue to be enriched, for a long time to come, with further\r\nachievements of his genius.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        Principle of Relativity\r\n\r\n\r\n                             INTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the present time, different opinions are being held about the\r\nfundamental equations of Electro-dynamics for moving bodies. The\r\nHertzian[9] forms must be given up, for it has appeared that they are\r\ncontrary to many experimental results.\r\n\r\nIn 1895 H. A. Lorentz[10] published his theory of optical and electrical\r\nphenomena in moving bodies; this theory was based upon the atomistic\r\nconception (vorstellung) of electricity, and on account of its great\r\nsuccess appears to have justified the bold hypotheses, by which it has\r\nbeen ushered into existence. In his theory, Lorentz proceeds from\r\ncertain equations, which must hold at every point of “Äther”; then by\r\nforming the average values over “Physically infinitely small” regions,\r\nwhich however contain large numbers of electrons, the equations for\r\nelectro-magnetic processes in moving bodies can be successfully built\r\nup.\r\n\r\nIn particular, Lorentz’s theory gives a good account of the\r\nnon-existence of relative motion of the earth and the luminiferous\r\n“Äther”; it shows that this fact is intimately connected with the\r\ncovariance of the original equation, when certain simultaneous\r\ntransformations of the space and time co-ordinates are effected; these\r\ntransformations have therefore obtained from H. Poincare[11] the name of\r\nLorentz-transformations. The covariance of these fundamental equations,\r\nwhen subjected to the Lorentz-transformation is a purely mathematical\r\nfact _i.e._ not based on any physical considerations; I will call this\r\nthe Theorem of Relativity; this theorem rests essentially on the form of\r\nthe differential equations for the propagation of waves with the\r\nvelocity of light.\r\n\r\nNow without _recognizing_ any hypothesis about the connection between\r\n“Äther” and matter, we can expect these mathematically evident theorems\r\nto have their consequences so far extended—that thereby even those laws\r\nof ponderable media which are yet unknown may anyhow possess this\r\ncovariance when subjected to a Lorentz-transformation; by saying this,\r\nwe do not indeed express an opinion, but rather a conviction,—and this\r\nconviction I may be permitted to call the Postulate of Relativity. The\r\nposition of affairs here is almost the same as when the Principle of\r\nConservation of Energy was postulated in cases, where the corresponding\r\nforms of energy were unknown.\r\n\r\nNow if hereafter, we succeed in maintaining this covariance as a\r\ndefinite connection between pure and simple observable phenomena in\r\nmoving bodies, the definite connection may be styled ‘the Principle of\r\nRelativity.’\r\n\r\nThese differentiations seem to me to be necessary for enabling us to\r\ncharacterise the present day position of the electro-dynamics for moving\r\nbodies.\r\n\r\nH. A. Lorentz[12] has found out the “Relativity theorem” and has created\r\nthe Relativity-postulate as a hypothesis that electrons and matter\r\nsuffer contractions in consequence of their motion according to a\r\ncertain law.\r\n\r\nA. Einstein[13] has brought out the point very clearly, that this\r\npostulate is not an artificial hypothesis but is rather a new way of\r\ncomprehending the time-concept which is forced upon us by observation of\r\nnatural phenomena.\r\n\r\nThe Principle of Relativity has not yet been formulated for\r\nelectro-dynamics of moving bodies in the sense characterized by me. In\r\nthe present essay, while formulating this principle, I shall obtain the\r\nfundamental equations for moving bodies in a sense which is uniquely\r\ndetermined by this principle.\r\n\r\nBut it will be shown that none of the forms hitherto assumed for these\r\nequations can exactly fit in with this principle.[14]\r\n\r\nWe would at first expect that the fundamental equations which are\r\nassumed by Lorentz for moving bodies would correspond to the Relativity\r\nPrinciple. But it will be shown that this is not the case for the\r\ngeneral equations which Lorentz has for any possible, and also for\r\nmagnetic bodies; but this is approximately the case (if neglect the\r\nsquare of the velocity of matter in comparison to the velocity of light)\r\nfor those equations which Lorentz hereafter infers for non-magnetic\r\nbodies. But this latter accordance with the Relativity Principle is due\r\nto the fact that the condition of non-magnetisation has been formulated\r\nin a way not corresponding to the Relativity Principle; therefore the\r\naccordance is due to the fortuitous compensation of two contradictions\r\nto the Relativity-Postulate. But meanwhile enunciation of the Principle\r\nin a rigid manner does not signify any contradiction to the hypotheses\r\nof Lorentz’s molecular theory, but it shall become clear that the\r\nassumption of the contraction of the electron in Lorentz’s theory must\r\nbe introduced at an earlier stage than Lorentz has actually done.\r\n\r\nIn an appendix, I have gone into discussion of the position of Classical\r\nMechanics with respect to the Relativity Postulate. Any easily\r\nperceivable modification of mechanics for satisfying the requirements of\r\nthe Relativity theory would hardly afford any noticeable difference in\r\nobservable processes; but would lead to very surprising consequences. By\r\nlaying down the Relativity-Postulate from the outset, sufficient means\r\nhave been created for deducing henceforth the complete series of Laws of\r\nMechanics from the principle of conservation of Energy alone (the form\r\nof the Energy being given in explicit forms).\r\n\r\n\r\n                               NOTATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nLet a rectangular system (_x_, _y_, _z_, _t_,) of reference be given in\r\nspace and time. The unit of time shall be chosen in such a manner with\r\nreference to the unit of length that the velocity of light in space\r\nbecomes unity.\r\n\r\nAlthough I would prefer not to change the notations used by Lorentz, it\r\nappears important to me to use a different selection of symbols, for\r\nthereby certain homogeneity will appear from the very beginning. I shall\r\ndenote the vector electric force by E, the magnetic induction by M, the\r\nelectric induction by _e_ and the magnetic force by _m_, so that (E, M,\r\n_e_, _m_) are used instead of Lorentz’s (E, B, D, H) respectively.\r\n\r\nI shall further make use of complex magnitudes in a way which is not yet\r\ncurrent in physical investigations, _i.e._, instead of operating with\r\n(_t_), I shall operate with (_i t_), where _i_ denotes √(-1). If now\r\ninstead of (_x_, _y_, _z_, _i t_), I use the method of writing with\r\nindices, certain essential circumstances will come into evidence; on\r\nthis will be based a general use of the suffixes (1, 2, 3, 4). The\r\nadvantage of this method will be, as I expressly emphasize here, that we\r\nshall have to handle symbols which have apparently a purely real\r\nappearance; we can however at any moment pass to real equations if it is\r\nunderstood that of the symbols with indices, such ones as have the\r\nsuffix 4 only once, denote imaginary quantities, while those which have\r\nnot at all the suffix 4, or have it twice denote real quantities.\r\n\r\nAn individual system of values of (_x_, _y_, _z_, _t_) _i. e._, of (_x₁_\r\n_x₂_ _x₃_ _x₄_) shall be called a space-time point.\r\n\r\nFurther let _u_ denote the velocity vector of matter, ε the dielectric\r\nconstant, μ the magnetic permeability, σ the conductivity of matter,\r\nwhile ρ denotes the density of electricity in space, and _x_ the vector\r\nof “Electric Current” which we shall some across in §7 and §8.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 PART I\r\n                                  § 2.\r\n                           The Limiting Case.\r\n                  The Fundamental Equations for Äther.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy using the electron theory, Lorentz in his above mentioned essay\r\ntraces the Laws of Electro-dynamics of Ponderable Bodies to still\r\nsimpler laws. Let us now adhere to these simpler laws, whereby we\r\nrequire that for the limiting case ε = 1, μ = 1, σ = 0, they should\r\nconstitute the laws for ponderable bodies. In this ideal limiting case ε\r\n= 1, μ = 1, σ = 0, E will be equal to _e_, and M to _m_. At every space\r\ntime point (_x_, _y_, _z_, _t_) we shall have the equations[15]\r\n\r\n                      (i) Curl _m_ - (δ_e_/δ_t_) = ρu\r\n\r\n                      (ii) div _e_ = ρ\r\n\r\n                      (iii) Curl _e_ + δ_m_/δ_t_ = 0\r\n\r\n                      (iv) div m = 0\r\n\r\nI shall now write (_x₁_ _x₂_ _x₃_ _x₄_) for (_x_, _y_, _z_, _t_) and\r\n(ρ₁, ρ₂, ρ₃, ρ₄) for\r\n\r\n$$ (\\rho u_{x}, \\rho u_{y}, \\rho u_{z}, i\\rho) $$\r\n\r\n_i.e._ the components of the convection current ρu, and the electric\r\ndensity multiplied by √ -1\r\n\r\nFurther I shall write\r\n\r\n     _f__{2 3}, _f__{3 1}, _f__{1 2}, _f__{1 4}, _f__{2 4}, _f__{3 4}.\r\n\r\nfor\r\n\r\n        m_{_x_}, m_{_y_}, m_{_z_}, -ie_{_x_}, -ie_{_y_}, -ie_{_z_}.\r\n\r\n_i.e._, the components of m and (-_i.e._) along the three axes; now if\r\nwe take any two indices (h. k) out of the series\r\n\r\n                     3, 4), _f__{_k h_} = -_f__{_k h_},\r\n\r\nTherefore\r\n\r\n               _f₃₂_ = -_f₂₃_, _f₁₃_ = -_f₃₁_, _f₂₁_ = -_f₁₂_\r\n               _f₄₁_ = -_f₁₄_, _f₄₄_ = -_f₂₄_, _f₄₃_ = -_f₃₄_\r\n\r\nThen the three equations comprised in (i), and the equation (ii)\r\nmultiplied by i becomes\r\n\r\n$$ \\begin{vmatrix} & \\frac{\\delta f_{1 2}}{\\delta x_{2}} & +\r\n\\frac{\\delta f_{1 3}}{\\delta x_{3}} & + \\frac{\\delta f_{1 4}}{\\delta\r\nx_{4}} & = \\rho_{1} \\frac{\\delta f_{2 1}}{\\delta x_{1}} & & +\r\n\\frac{\\delta f_{2 3}}{\\delta x_{3}} & \\times \\frac{\\delta f_{2\r\n4}}{\\delta x_{4}} & = \\rho_{2} \\frac{\\delta f_{3 1}}{\\delta x_{1}} &\r\n\\times \\frac{\\delta f_{3 2}}{\\delta x_{2}} & & + \\frac{\\delta f_{3\r\n4}}{\\delta x_{4}} & = \\rho_{3} \\frac{\\delta f_{4 1}}{\\delta x_{1}} & +\r\n\\frac{\\delta f_{4 2}}{\\delta x_{2}} & + \\frac{\\delta f_{4 3}}{\\delta\r\nx_{3}} & & = \\rho_{4} \\end{vmatrix} × $$\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the three equations comprised in (iii) and the (iv)\r\nequation multiplied by (_i_) becomes\r\n\r\n$$ \\begin{vmatrix} & \\frac{\\delta f_{3 4}}{\\delta x_{2}} & +\r\n\\frac{\\delta f_{4 2}}{\\delta x_{3}} & + \\frac{\\delta f_{2 3}}{\\delta\r\nx_{4}} & = = \\frac{\\delta f_{4 3}}{\\delta x_{1}} & & + \\frac{\\delta f_{1\r\n4}}{\\delta x_{3}} & + \\frac{\\delta f_{3 1}}{\\delta x_{4}} & =\r\n0 \\frac{\\delta f_{2 4}}{\\delta x_{1}} & + \\frac{\\delta f_{4 1}}{\\delta\r\nx_{2}} & & + \\frac{\\delta f_{1 2}}{\\delta x_{4}} & = 0 \\frac{\\delta f_{3\r\n2}}{\\delta x_{1}} & + \\frac{\\delta f_{1 3}}{\\delta x_{2}} & +\r\n\\frac{\\delta f_{2 1}}{\\delta x_{3}} & & = - \\end{vmatrix} × $$\r\n\r\nBy means of this method of writing we at once notice the perfect\r\nsymmetry of the 1st as well as the 2nd system of equations as regards\r\npermutation with the indices, (1, 2, 3, 4).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  § 3.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is well-known that by writing the equations i) to iv) in the symbol\r\nof vector calculus, we at once set in evidence an invariance (or rather\r\na (covariance) of the system of equations A) as well as of B), when the\r\nco-ordinate system is rotated through a certain amount round the\r\nnull-point.

Special Lorentz Transformation.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rôle which is played by the Z-axis in the transformation (4) can\r\neasily be transferred to any other axis when the system of axes are\r\nsubjected to a transformation about this last axis. So we came to a more\r\ngeneral law:—\r\n\r\nLet _v_ be a vector with the components _v__{_x_}, _v__{_y_}, _v__{_z_},\r\nand let | _v_ | = _q_ < 1. By _ṽ_ we shall denote any vector which is\r\nperpendicular to _v_, and by _r__{_v_}, _r__{_ṽ_} we shall denote\r\ncomponents of _r_ in direction of _ṽ_ and _v_.\r\n\r\nInstead of (_x_, _y_, _z_, _t_), new magnetudes (_x′_ _y′_ _z′_ _t′_)\r\nwill be introduced in the following way. If for the sake of shortness,\r\n_r_ is written for the vector with the components (_x_, _y_, _z_) in the\r\nfirst system of reference, _r′_ for the same vector with the components\r\n(_x′_ _y′_ _z′_) in the second system of reference, then for the\r\ndirection of _v_, we have\r\n\r\n              (10) _r′__{_v_} = (_r__{_v_} - _qt_)/√(1 - _q²_)\r\n\r\nand for the perpendicular direction _ṽ_,\r\n\r\n                        (11) _r′__{_ṽ_} = _r__{_ṽ_}\r\n\r\nand further (12) _t′_ = (-_qr__{_v_} + _t_)/√(1 - _q²_).\r\n\r\nThe notations (_r′__{_ṽ_}, _r′__{_v_}) are to be understood in the sense\r\nthat with the directions _v_, and every direction _ṽ_ perpendicular to\r\n_v_ in the system (_x_, _y_, _z_) are always associated the directions\r\nwith the same direction cosines in the system (_x′_ _y′_ _z′_).\r\n\r\nA transformation which is accomplished by means of (10), (11), (12)\r\nwith the condition 0 < _q_ < 1 will be called a special\r\nLorentz-transformation. We shall call _v_ the vector, the direction of\r\n_v_ the axis, and the magnitude of _v_ the moment of this\r\ntransformation.\r\n\r\nIf further ρ′ and the vectors _u′_, _e′_, _m′_, in the system (_x′_ _y′_\r\n_z′_) are so defined that,\r\n\r\n               (13) ρ′ = ρ[(-_qu__{_v_} + 1)/√(1 - _q²_)],\r\n               ρ′_u_′_{_v_} = ρ(_u__{_v_} - _q_)/√(1 - _q²_),\r\n               ρ′_u__{_ṽ_} =  ρ′_u__{_v_},\r\n\r\nfurther\r\n\r\n    (14) (_e′_ + _im′_)_{_ṽ_} = ((_e_ + _im_) - _i_[_v_, (_e_ +\r\n       _im_])']_{_ṽ_})/√(1 - _q²_).\r\n\r\n    (15) (_e′_ + _im′_)_{_v_} = (_e_ + _im_) - _i_[_u_, (_e_ +\r\n       _im_)]_{_v_}.\r\n\r\nThen it follows that the equations I), II), III), IV) are transformed\r\ninto the corresponding system with dashes.\r\n\r\nThe solution of the equations (10), (11), (12) leads to\r\n\r\n             (16) _r__{_v_} = (_r′__{_v_} + _qt′_)/√(1 - _q²_),\r\n             _r__{_ṽ_} = _r′__{_ṽ_},\r\n             _t_ = (_qr′__{_v_} + _t′_)/√(1 - _q²_),\r\n\r\nNow we shall make a very important observation about the vectors _u_ and\r\n_u′_. We can again introduce the indices 1, 2, 3, 4, so that we write\r\n(_x₁_′, _x₂_′, _x₃_′, _x₄_′) instead of (_x′_, _y′_, _z′_, _it′_) and\r\nρ₁′, ρ₂′, ρ₃′, ρ₄′ instead of (ρ′_u′_{_x′_}, ρ′_u′_{_y′_}, ρ′_u′_{_z′_},\r\n_i_ρ′).\r\n\r\nLike the rotation round the Z-axis, the transformation (4), and more\r\ngenerally the transformations (10), (11), (12), are also linear\r\ntransformations with the determinant + 1, so that\r\n\r\n    (17) _x₁²_ + _x₂²_ + _x₃²_ + _x₄²_ _i. e._ _x²_ + _y²_ + _z²_ -\r\n       _t²_,\r\n\r\nis transformed into\r\n\r\n    _x₁′²_ + _x₂′²_ + _x₃′²_ + _x₄′²_ _i. e._ _x′²_ + _y′²_ + _z′²_ -\r\n       _t′²_.\r\n\r\nOn the basis of the equations (13), (14), we shall have (ρ₁² + ρ₂² + ρ₃²\r\n+ ρ₄²) = ρ²(1 - _u__{_x²_}, -_u__{_y²_}, -_u__{_z²_}) = ρ²(1 - _u²_)\r\ntransformed into ρ²(1 - _u²_) or in other words,\r\n\r\n                             (18) ρ√(1 - _u²_)\r\n\r\nis an invariant in a Lorentz-transformation.\r\n\r\nIf we divide (ρ₁, ρ₂, ρ₃, ρ₄) by this magnitude, we obtain the four\r\nvalues (ω₁, ω₂, ω₃, ω₄) = (1/√(1 - _u²_))(_u__{_x_}, _u__{_y_},\r\n_u__{_z_}, _i_) so that ω₁² + ω₂² + ω₃² + ω₄² = -1.\r\n\r\nIt is apparent that these four values are determined by the vector _u_\r\nand inversely the vector _u_ of magnitude < 1 follows from the 4 values\r\nω₁, ω₂, ω₃, ω₄; where (ω₁, ω₂, ω₃) are real, -_i_ω₄ real and positive\r\nand condition (19) is fulfilled.\r\n\r\nThe meaning of (ω₁, ω₂, ω₃, ω₄) here is, that they are the ratios of\r\n_dx₁_, _dx₂_, _dx₃_, _dx₄_ to\r\n\r\n      (20) √(-(_dx₁²_ + _dx₂²_ + _dx₃²_ + _dx₄²_)) = _dt_√(1 - _u²_).\r\n\r\nThe differentials denoting the displacements of matter occupying the\r\nspacetime point (_x₁_, _x₂_, _x₃_, _x₄_) to the adjacent space-time\r\npoint.\r\n\r\nAfter the Lorentz-transformation is accomplished the velocity of matter\r\nin the new system of reference for the same space-time point (_x′_ _y′_\r\n_z′_ _t′_) is the vector _u′_ with the ratios _dx′_/_dt′_, _dy′_/_dt′_,\r\n_dz′_/_dt′_, _dl′_/_dt′_, as components.\r\n\r\nNow it is quite apparent that the system of values\r\n\r\n                 _x₁_ = ω₁, _x₂_ = ω₂, _x₃_ = ω₃, _x₄_ = ω₄\r\n\r\nis transformed into the values\r\n\r\n             _x₁′_ = ω₁′, _x₂′_ = ω₂′, _x₃′_ = ω₃′, _x₄′_ = ω₄′\r\n\r\nin virtue of the Lorentz-transformation (10), (11), (12).\r\n\r\nThe dashed system has got the same meaning for the velocity _u′_ after\r\nthe transformation as the first system of values has got for _u_ before\r\ntransformation.\r\n\r\nIf in particular the vector _v_ of the special Lorentz-transformation be\r\nequal to the velocity vector _u_ of matter at the space-time point\r\n(_x₁_, _x₂_, _x₃_, _x₄_) then it follows out of (10), (11), (12) that\r\n\r\n                    ω₁′ = 0, ω₂′ = 0, ω₃′ = 0, ω₄′ = _i_\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances therefore, the corresponding space-time point\r\nhas the velocity _v′_ = 0 after the transformation, it is as if we\r\ntransform to rest. We may call the invariant ρ√(1 - _u²_) the\r\nrest-density of Electricity.[16]\r\n\r\n\r\n                        § 5. Space-time Vectors.\r\n                        Of the 1st and 2nd kind.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf we take the principal result of the Lorentz transformation together\r\nwith the fact that the system (A) as well as the system (B) is covariant\r\nwith respect to a rotation of the coordinate-system round the null\r\npoint, we obtain the general _relativity theorem_. In order to make the\r\nfacts easily comprehensible, it may be more convenient to define a\r\nseries of expressions, for the purpose of expressing the ideas in a\r\nconcise form, while on the other hand I shall adhere to the practice of\r\nusing complex magnitudes, in order to render certain symmetries quite\r\nevident.\r\n\r\nLet us take a linear homogeneous transformation,\r\n\r\n$$ \\begin{vmatrix} x_{1} x_{2} x_{3} x_{4} \\end{vmatrix} =\r\n\\begin{vmatrix} a_{1 1} & a_{1 2} & a_{1 3} & a_{1 4} a_{2 1} & a_{2\r\n2} & a_{2 3} & a_{2 4} a_{3 1} & a_{3 2} & a_{3 3} & a_{3 4} a_{4 1} &\r\na_{4 2} & a_{4 3} & a_{4 4} \\end{vmatrix} \\begin{vmatrix}\r\nx_{1}' x_{2}' x_{3}' x_{4}' \\end{vmatrix} $$\r\n\r\nthe Determinant of the matrix is +1, all co-efficients without the index\r\n4 occurring once are real, while _a₄₁_, _a₄₂_, _a₄₃_, are purely\r\nimaginary, but _a₄₄_ is real and > 0, and _x₁²_ + _x₂²_ + _x₃²_ + _x₄²_\r\ntransforms into _x₁′²_ + _x₂′²_ + _x₃′²_ + _x₄′²_. The operation shall\r\nbe called a general Lorentz transformation.\r\n\r\n(This notation, which is due to Dr. C. E.

Under a\r\nspace-time vector of the 1st kind shall be understood a system of four\r\nmagnitudes (ρ₁, ρ₂, ρ₃, ρ₄) with the condition that in case of a\r\nLorentz-transformation it is to be replaced by the set (ρ₁′, ρ₂′, ρ₃′,\r\nρ₄′), where these are the values of (_x₁′_, _x₂′_, _x₃′_, _x₄′_),\r\nobtained by substituting (ρ₁, ρ₂, ρ₃, ρ₄) for (_x₁_, _x₂_, _x₃_, _x₄_)\r\nin the expression (21).\r\n\r\nBesides the time-space vector of the 1st kind (_x₁_, _x₂_, _x₃_, _x₄_)\r\nwe shall also make use of another space-time vector of the first kind\r\n(_y₁_, _y₂_, _y₃_, _y₄_), and let us form the linear combination\r\n\r\n    (23) _f₂₃_(_x₂__y₃_ - _x₃__y₂_) + _f₃₁_(_x₃__y₁_ - _x₁__y₃_) +\r\n       _f₁₂_(_x₁__y₂_\r\n    - _x₂__y₁_) + _f₁₄_(_x₁__y₄_ - _x₄__y₁_) + _f₂₄_(_x₂__y₄_ -\r\n       _x₄__y₂_) +\r\n    _f₃₄_(_x₃__y₄_ - _x₄__y₃_)\r\n\r\nwith six coefficients _f₂₃_--_f₃₄_. Let us remark that in the vectorial\r\nmethod of writing, this can be constructed out of the four vectors.\r\n\r\n_x₁_, _x₂_, _x₃_; _y₁_, _y₂_, _y₃_; _f₂₃_, _f₃₁_, _f₁₂_; _f₁₄_, _f₂₄_,\r\n_f₃₄_ and the constants _x₄_ and _y₄_, at the same time it is\r\nsymmetrical with regard the indices (1, 2, 3, 4).\r\n\r\nIf we subject (_x₁_, _x₂_, _x₃_, _x₄_) and (_y₁_, _y₂_, _y₃_, _y₄_)\r\nsimultaneously to the Lorentz transformation (21), the combination (23)\r\nis changed to:\r\n\r\n    (24) _f₂₃′_(_x₂′__y₃′_ - _x₃′__y₂′_) + _f₃₁_(_x₃′__y₁′_ -\r\n       _x₁′__y₃′_) + _f₁₂_\r\n    (_x₁′__y₂′_ - _x₂′__y₁′_) + _f₁₄′_(_x₁′__y₄′_) - _x₄′__y₁′_) +\r\n       _f₂₄′_(_x₂′__y₄′_\r\n    - _x₄′__y₂′_) + _f₃₄′_(_x₃′__y₄′_ - _x₄′__y₃′_),\r\n\r\nwhere the coefficients _f₂₃′_, _f₃₁′_, _f₁₂′_, _f₁₄′_, _f₂₄′_, _f₃₄′_,\r\ndepend solely on (_f₂₃_ _f₂₄_) and the coefficients _a₁₁_ ... _a₄₄_.\r\n\r\nWe shall define a space-time Vector of the 2nd kind as a system of\r\nsix-magnitudes _f₂₃_, _f₃₁_ ... _f₃₄_, with the condition that when\r\nsubjected to a Lorentz transformation, it is changed to a new system\r\n_f₂₃′_ ... f₃₄, ... which satisfies the connection between (23) and\r\n(24).\r\n\r\nI enunciate in the following manner the general theorem of relativity\r\ncorresponding to the equations (I)-(iv),—which are the fundamental\r\nequations for Äther.\r\n\r\nIf _x_, _y_, _z_, _it_ (space co-ordinates, and time _it_) is subjected\r\nto a Lorentz transformation, and at the same time (_pu__{_x_},\r\n_pu__{_y_}, _pu__{_z_}, _i_ρ) (convection-current, and charge density\r\nρ_i_) is transformed as a space time vector of the 1st kind, further\r\n(_m__{_x_}, _m__{_y_}, _m__{_z_}, -_ie__{_x_}, -_ie__{_y_}, -_ie__{_z_})\r\n(magnetic force, and electric induction × (-_i_) is transformed as a\r\nspace time vector of the 2nd kind, then the system of equations (I),\r\n(II), and the system of equations (III), (IV) transforms into\r\nessentially corresponding relations between the corresponding magnitudes\r\nnewly introduced into the system.\r\n\r\nThese facts can be more concisely expressed in these words: the system\r\nof equations (I and II) as well as the system of equations (III) (IV)\r\nare covariant in all cases of Lorentz-transformation, where (ρ_u_, _i_ρ)\r\nis to be transformed as a space time vector of the 1st kind, (_m_ -\r\n_ie_) is to be treated as a vector of the 2nd kind, or more\r\nsignificantly,—\r\n\r\n(ρ_u_, _i_ρ) is a space time vector of the 1st kind, (_m_ - _ie_)[17] is\r\na space-time vector of the 2nd kind.\r\n\r\nI shall add a few more remarks here in order to elucidate the conception\r\nof space-time vector of the 2nd kind. Clearly, the following are\r\ninvariants for such a vector when subjected to a group of Lorentz\r\ntransformation.\r\n\r\n    (_i_) _m²_ - _e²_ = _f₂₃²_ + _f₃₁²_ + _f₁₂²_ + _f₁₄²_ + _f₂₄²_ +\r\n       _f₂₄²_\r\n\r\n    _me_ = _i_(_f₂₃__f₁₄_ + _f₃₁__f₂₄_ + _f₁₂__f₃₄_).\r\n\r\nA space-time vector of the second kind (_m_ - _ie_), where (_m_ and _e_)\r\nare real magnitudes, may be called singular, when the scalar square (_m_\r\n- _ie_)² = 0, _ie_ _m²_ - _e²_ = 0, and at the same time (_m e_) = 0,\r\n_ie_ the vector _m_ and _e_ are equal and perpendicular to each other;\r\nwhen such is the case, these two properties remain conserved for the\r\nspace-time vector of the 2nd kind in every Lorentz-transformation.\r\n\r\nIf the space-time vector of the 2nd kind is not singular, we rotate the\r\nspacial co-ordinate system in such a manner that the vector-product\r\n[_me_] coincides with the Z-axis, _i.e._ _m__{_x_} = 0, _e__{_x_} = 0.\r\nThen\r\n\r\n        (_m__{_x_}, -_i e__{_x_})² + (_m__{_y_}, -_i e__{_y_})² ≠ 0.\r\n\r\nTherefore (_e__{_y_} + _i m__{_y_})/(_e__{_x_} + _i e__{_x_}) is\r\ndifferent from +_i_, and we can therefore define a complex argument (φ +\r\n_i_ψ) in such a manner that\r\n\r\n                      tan (φ + _i_ψ)\r\n\r\n                             _e__{_y_} + _i m__{_y_}\r\n                          = -------------------------\r\n                             _e__{_x_} + _i m__{_x_}\r\n\r\nIf then, by referring back to equations (9), we carry out the\r\ntransformation (1) through the angle ψ and a subsequent rotation round\r\nthe Z-axis through the angle φ, we perform a Lorentz-transformation at\r\nthe end of which _m__{_y_} = 0, _e__{_y_} = 0, and therefore _m_ and _e_\r\nshall both coincide with the new Z-axis. Then by means of the invariants\r\n_m²_ - _e²_, (_me_) the final values of these vectors, whether they are\r\nof the same or of opposite directions, or whether one of them is equal\r\nto zero, would be at once settled.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         § 6. Concept of Time.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the Lorentz transformation, we are allowed to effect certain\r\n_changes_ of the time parameter. In consequence of this fact, it is no\r\nlonger permissible to speak of the absolute simultaneity of two events.\r\nThe ordinary idea of simultaneity rather presupposes that six\r\nindependent parameters, which are evidently required for defining a\r\nsystem of space and time axes, are somehow reduced to three. Since we\r\nare accustomed to consider that these limitations represent in a unique\r\nway the actual facts very approximately, we maintain that the\r\nsimultaneity of two events exists of themselves.[18] In fact, the\r\nfollowing considerations will prove conclusive.\r\n\r\nLet a reference system (_x_, _y_, _z_, _t_) for space time points\r\n(events) be somehow known. Now if a space point A (_x₀_, _y₀_, _z₀_) the\r\ntime _t₀_ be compared with a space point P (_x_, _y_, _z_) at the time\r\n_t_, and if the difference of time _t_ - _t₀_, (let _t_ > _t₀_) be less\r\nthan the length A P _i.e._ less than the time required for the\r\npropagation of light from A to P, and if _q_ = (_t_ - _t₀_)/(A P) < 1,\r\nthen by a special Lorentz transformation, in which A P is taken as the\r\naxis, and which has the moment _q_, we can introduce a time parameter\r\n_t′_, which (see equation 11, 12, § 4) has got the same value _t′_ = _0_\r\nfor both space-time points (A, _t₀_), and (P, t). So the two events can\r\nnow be comprehended to be simultaneous.\r\n\r\nFurther, let us take at the same time _t₀_ = 0, two different\r\nspace-points A, B, or three space-points (A, B, C) which are not in the\r\nsame space-line, and compare therewith a space point P, which is outside\r\nthe line A B, or the plane A B C, at another time _t_, and let the time\r\ndifference _t_ - _t₀_ (t > _t₀_) be less than the time which light\r\nrequires for propagation from the line A B, or the plane (A B C) to P.\r\nLet q be the quotient of (_t_ - _t₀_) by the second time. Then if a\r\nLorentz transformation is taken in which the perpendicular from P on A\r\nB, or from P on the plane A B C is the axis, and q is the moment, then\r\nall the three (or four) events (A, _t₀_), (B, _t₀_), (C, _t₀_) and (P,\r\nt) are simultaneous.\r\n\r\nIf four space-points, which do not lie in one plane, are conceived to be\r\nat the same time _t₀_, then it is no longer permissible to make a change\r\nof the time parameter by a Lorentz-transformation, without at the same\r\ntime destroying the character of the simultaneity of these four space\r\npoints.\r\n\r\nTo the mathematician, accustomed on the one hand to the methods of\r\ntreatment of the poly-dimensional manifold, and on the other hand to the\r\nconceptual figures of the so-called non-Euclidean Geometry, there can be\r\nno difficulty in adopting this concept of time to the application of the\r\nLorentz-transformation. The paper of Einstein which has been cited in\r\nthe Introduction, has succeeded to some extent in presenting the nature\r\nof the transformation from the physical standpoint.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  PART II. ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PHENOMENA.\r\n             § 7. Fundamental Equations for bodies at rest.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter these preparatory works, which have been first developed on\r\naccount of the small amount of mathematics involved in the limiting case\r\nε = 1, μ = 1, σ = 0, let us turn to the electro-magnetic phenomena in\r\nmatter. We look for those relations which make it possible for us—when\r\nproper fundamental data are given—to obtain the following quantities at\r\nevery place and time, and therefore at every space-time point as\r\nfunctions of (_x_, _y_, _z_, _t_):—the vector of the electric force E,\r\nthe magnetic induction M, the electrical induction _e_, the magnetic\r\nforce _m_, the electrical space-density ρ, the electric current s (whose\r\nrelation hereafter to the conduction current is known by the manner in\r\nwhich conductivity occurs in the process), and lastly the vector _v_,\r\nthe velocity of matter.\r\n\r\nThe relations in question can be divided into two classes.\r\n\r\nFirstly—those equations, which,—when _v_, the velocity of matter is\r\ngiven as a function of (_x_, _y_, _z_, _t_),—lead us to a knowledge of\r\nother magnitude as functions of _x_, _y_, _z_, _t_—I shall call this\r\nfirst class of equations the fundamental equations—\r\n\r\nSecondly, the expressions for the ponderomotive force, which, by the\r\napplication of the Laws of Mechanics, gives us further information about\r\nthe vector _u_ as functions of (_x_, _y_, _z_, _t_).\r\n\r\nFor the case of bodies at rest, _i.e._ when _u_ (_x_, _y_, _z_, _t_) = 0\r\nthe theories of Maxwell (Heaviside, Hertz) and Lorentz lead to the same\r\nfundamental equations. They are;—\r\n\r\n(1) The Differential Equations:—which contain no constant referring to\r\nmatter:—\r\n\r\n                      (_i_) Curl _m_ - δ_e_/δ_t_ = C,\r\n                      (_ii_) div _e_ = lρ.\r\n                      (_iii_) Curl E + δM/δ_t_ = 0,\r\n                      (_iv_) Div M = 0.\r\n\r\n(2) Further relations, which characterise the influence of existing\r\nmatter for the most important case to which we limit ourselves _i.e._\r\nfor isotopic bodies;—they are comprised in the equations\r\n\r\n                      (V) _e_ = ε E, M = μ_m_, C = σE.\r\n\r\nwhere ε = dielectric constant, μ = magnetic permeability, σ = the\r\nconductivity of matter, all given as function of _x_, _y_, _z_, _t_; _s_\r\nis here the conduction current.\r\n\r\nBy employing a modified form of writing, I shall now cause a latent\r\nsymmetry in these equations to appear. I put, as in the previous work,\r\n\r\n              _x₁_ = _x_, _x₂_ = _y_, _x₃_ = _z_, _x₄_ = _it_,\r\n\r\nand write _s₁_, _s₂_, _s₃_, _s₄_ for C_{_x_}, C_{_y_}, C_{_z_} (√-1)ρ.\r\n\r\nFurther _f₂₃_, _f₃₁_, _f₁₂_, _f₁₄_, _f₂₄_, _f₃₄_\r\n\r\nfor _m__{_x_}, _m__{_y_}, _m__{_z_}, -_i_(_e__{_x_}, _e__{_y_},\r\n_e__{_z_}),\r\n\r\nand F₂₃, F₃₁, F₁₂, F₁₄, F₂₄, F₃₄\r\n\r\nfor M_{_x_}, M_{_y_}, M_{_z_}, -_i_(E_{_x_}, E_{_y_}, E_{_z_})\r\n\r\nlastly we shall have the relation _f__{k h} = - _f__{_h k_}, _F__{_k h_}\r\n= -_F__{_h k_}, (the letter _f_, F shall denote the field, _s_ the\r\n(_i.e._ current).\r\n\r\nThen the fundamental Equations can be written as\r\n\r\n           (A)\r\n               ∂_f₁₂_/∂_x₂_ + ∂_f₁₃_/∂_x₃_ + ∂_f₁₄_/∂_x₄_ = s₁\r\n\r\n           ∂_f₂₁_/∂_x₁_ +    + ∂_f₂₃_/∂_x₃_ + ∂_f₂₄_/∂_x₄_ = s₂\r\n\r\n           ∂_f₃₁_/∂_x₁_ + ∂_f₃₂_/∂_x₂_ +    + ∂_f₃₄_/∂_x₄_ = s₃\r\n\r\n           ∂_f₄₁_/∂_x₁_ + ∂_f₄₂_/∂_x₂_ + ∂_f₄₃_/∂_x₃_       = s₄\r\n\r\nand the equations (3) and (4), are\r\n\r\n                   ∂F₃₄/∂_x₂_ + ∂F₄₂/∂_x₃_ + ∂F₂₃/∂_x₄_ = 0\r\n\r\n              ∂F₄₃/∂_x₁_ +     + ∂F₁₄/∂_x₃_ + ∂F₃₁∂_x₄_ = 0\r\n\r\n              ∂F₂₄/∂_x₁_ + ∂F₄₁/∂_x₂_ +    + ∂F₁₂/∂_x₄_ = 0\r\n\r\n              ∂F₃₂/∂_x₁_ + ∂F₁₃/∂_x₂_ + ∂F₂₁/∂_x₃_         = 0\r\n\r\n\r\n                    § 8. The Fundamental Equations.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are now in a position to establish in a unique way the fundamental\r\nequations for bodies moving in any manner by means of these three axioms\r\nexclusively.\r\n\r\nThe first Axion shall be,—\r\n\r\nWhen a detached region[19] of matter is at rest at any moment, therefore\r\nthe vector _u_ is zero, for a system (_x_, _y_, _z_, _t_)—the\r\nneighbourhood may be supposed to be in motion in any possible manner,\r\nthen for the space-time point _x_, _y_, _z_, _t_, the same relations (A)\r\n(B) (V) which hold in the case when all matter is at rest, shall also\r\nhold between ρ, the vectors C, _e_, _m_, _M_, _E_ and their\r\ndifferentials with respect to _x_, _y_, _z_, _t_. The second axiom shall\r\nbe:—\r\n\r\nEvery velocity of matter is < 1, smaller than the velocity of\r\npropagation of light.[20]\r\n\r\nThe fundamental equations are of such a kind that when (_x_, _y_, _z_,\r\n_it_) are subjected to a Lorentz transformation and thereby (_m_ - _ie_)\r\nand (_M_ - _iE_) are transformed into space-time vectors of the second\r\nkind, (C, _i_ρ) as a space-time vector of the 1st kind, the equations\r\nare transformed into essentially identical forms involving the\r\ntransformed magnitudes.\r\n\r\nShortly I can signify the third axiom as:—\r\n\r\n(_m_, -_ie_), and (_M_, -_iE_) are space-time vectors of the second\r\nkind, (C, _i_p) is a space-time vector of the first kind.\r\n\r\nThis axiom I call the Principle of Relativity.\r\n\r\nIn fact these three axioms lead us from the previously mentioned\r\nfundamental equations for bodies at rest to the equations for moving\r\nbodies in an unambiguous way.\r\n\r\nAccording to the second axiom, the magnitude of the velocity vector |\r\n_u_ | is < 1 at any space-time point. In consequence, we can always\r\nwrite, instead of the vector _u_, the following set of four allied\r\nquantities\r\n\r\n                         ω₁ = u_{_x_}/√(1 - _u²_),\r\n                         ω₂ = u_{_y_}/√(1 - u²),\r\n                         ω₃ = u_{_z_}/√(1 - u²),\r\n                         ω₄ = _i_/√(1 - u²)\r\n\r\nwith the relation\r\n\r\n                      (27) ω₁² + ω₂² + ω₃² + ω₄² = - |\r\n\r\nFrom what has been said at the end of § 4, it is clear that in the case\r\nof a Lorentz-transformation, this set behaves like a space-time vector\r\nof the 1st kind.\r\n\r\nLet us now fix our attention on a certain point (_x_, _y_, _z_) of\r\nmatter at a certain time (_t_). If at this space-time point _u_ = 0,\r\nthen we have at once for this point the equations (_A_), (_B_) (_V_) of\r\n§ 7. If _u_ ≠ 0, then there exists according to 16), in case | _u_ | <\r\n1, a special Lorentz-transformation, whose vector _v_ is equal to this\r\nvector _u_ (_x_, _y_, _z_, _t_), and we pass on to a new system of\r\nreference (_x′_ _y′_ _z′_ _t′_) in accordance with this transformation.\r\nTherefore for the space-time point considered, there arises as in § 4,\r\nthe new values 28) ω′₁ = 0, ω′₂ = 0, ω′₃ = 0, ω′₄ = _i_, therefore the\r\nnew velocity vector ω′ = 0, the space-time point is as if transformed to\r\nrest. Now according to the third axiom the system of equations for the\r\ntransformed point (_x′_ _y′_ _z′_ _t_) involves the newly introduced\r\nmagnitude (_u′_ ρ′, C′, _e′_, _m′_, _E′_, _M′_) and their differential\r\nquotients with respect to (_x′_, _y′_, _z′_, _t′_) in the same manner as\r\nthe original equations for the point (_x_, _y_, _z_, _t_). But according\r\nto the first axiom, when _u′_ = 0, these equations must be exactly\r\nequivalent to\r\n\r\n(1) the differential equations (_A′_), (_B′_), which are obtained from\r\nthe equations (_A_), (_B_) by simply dashing the symbols in (_A_) and\r\n(_B_).\r\n\r\n(2) and the equations\r\n\r\n               (V′) _e′_ = ε_E′_, _M’_ = μ_m′_, _C′_ = σ_E′_\r\n\r\nwhere ε, μ, σ are the dielectric constant, magnetic permeability, and\r\nconductivity for the system (_x′_ _y′_ _z′_ _t′_) _i.e._ in the\r\nspace-time point (_x_ _y_, _z_ _t_) of matter.\r\n\r\nNow let us return, by means of the reciprocal Lorentz-transformation to\r\nthe original variables (_x_, _y_, _z_, _t_), and the magnitudes (_u_, ρ,\r\nC, _e_, _m_, _E_, _M_) and the equations, which we then obtain from the\r\nlast mentioned, will be the fundamental equations sought by us for the\r\nmoving bodies.\r\n\r\nNow from § 4, and § 6, it is to be seen that the equations _A_), as well\r\nas the equations _B_) are covariant for a Lorentz-transformation, _i.e._\r\nthe equations, which we obtain backwards from _A′_) _B′_), must be\r\nexactly of the same form as the equations _A_) and _B_), as we take them\r\nfor bodies at rest. We have therefore as the first result:—\r\n\r\nThe differential equations expressing the fundamental equations of\r\nelectrodynamics for moving bodies, when written in ρ and the vectors C,\r\n_e_, _m_, E, M, are exactly of the same form as the equations for moving\r\nbodies. The velocity of matter does not enter in these equations. In the\r\nvectorial way of writing, we have\r\n\r\n                       I) curl _m_ - ∂_e_/∂_t_ = C₁,\r\n\r\n                       II) div _e_ = ρ\r\n\r\n                       III) curl E + ∂M/∂_t_ = 0\r\n\r\n                       IV) div M = 0\r\n\r\nThe velocity of matter occurs only in the auxiliary equations which\r\ncharacterise the influence of matter on the basis of their\r\ncharacteristic constants ε, μ, σ. Let us now transform these auxiliary\r\nequations V′) into the original co-ordinates (_x_, _y_, _z_, and _t_.)\r\n\r\nAccording to formula 15) in § 4, the component of _e′_ in the direction\r\nof the vector _u_ is the same as that of (_e_ + [_u_ _m_]), the\r\ncomponent of _m′_ is the same as that of _m_ - [_u_ _e_], but for the\r\nperpendicular direction _ū_, the components of _e′_, _m′_ are the same\r\nas those of (_e_ + [_u_ _m_]) and (_m_ - [_u_ _e_], multiplied by 1/√(1\r\n- _u²_). On the other hand E′ and M′ shall stand to E + [_u_M], and M -\r\n[_u_E] in the same relation as _e′_ and _m′_ to _e_ + [_um_], and _m_ -\r\n(_ue_). From the relation _e′_ = εE′, the following equations follow\r\n\r\n                     (C) _e_ + [_um_] = ε(E + [_u_M]),\r\n\r\nand from the relation M′ = μ_m′_, we have\r\n\r\n                     (D) M - [_u_ E] = μ(_m_ - [_ue_]),\r\n\r\nFor the components in the directions perpendicular to _u_, and to each\r\nother, the equations are to be multiplied by √(1 - _u²_).\r\n\r\nThen the following equations follow from the transformation? equations\r\n(12), (10), (11) in § 4, when we replace q, _r__{_v_}, _r__{_ṽ_}, _t_,\r\n_r′__{_v_}, _r′__{_ṽ_}, _t’_ by |_u_|, C_{_u_}, C_{_ū_}, ρ, C′_{_u_},\r\nC′_{_ū_}, ρ′\r\n\r\n          ρ′ = (-|_u_| C_{_u_} + ρ)/√(1 - _u²_),\r\n          C’_{_u_} = (C_{_u_} - |_u_|ρ)/√(1 - _u²_),\r\n          C′_{_ū_} = C_{_ū_},\r\n\r\n          E) (C_{_u_} - |_u_|ρ)/√(1 - _u²_) = σ(E + [_u_M])_{_u_},\r\n\r\n          C_{_ū_} = σ (E + [_u_M])_{_u_}/√(1 - _u²_).\r\n\r\nIn consideration of the manner in which σ enters into these relations,\r\nit will be convenient to call the vector C - ρ_u_ with the components\r\nC_{_u_} - ρ|_u_| in the direction of _u_, and C′_{_ū_} in the directions\r\n_ū_ perpendicular to _u_ the “Convection current.” This last vanishes\r\nfor σ = 0.\r\n\r\nWe remark that for ε = 1, μ = 1 the equations _e′_ = E′, _m′_ = M′\r\nimmediately lead to the equations _e_ = E, _m_ = M by means of a\r\nreciprocal Lorentz-transformation with -_u_ as vector; and for σ = 0,\r\nthe equation C′ = 0 leads to C = ρ_u_; that the fundamental equations of\r\nÄther discussed in § 2 becomes in fact the limitting case of the\r\nequations obtained here with ε = 1, μ = 1, σ = 0.\r\n\r\n\r\n          § 9. The Fundamental Equations in Lorentz’s Theory.\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us now see how far the fundamental equations assumed by Lorentz\r\ncorrespond to the Relativity postulate, as defined in §8. In the article\r\non Electron-theory (Ency., Math., Wiss., Bd. V. 2, Art 14) Lorentz has\r\ngiven the fundamental equations for any possible, even magnetised bodies\r\n(see there page 209, Eqn XXX′, formula (14) on page 78 of the same\r\n(part).\r\n\r\n          (III_a″_) Curl (H - [_u_E]) = J + _d_D/_dt_ + _u_ div D\r\n          - curl [_u_D].\r\n\r\n          (I″) div D = ρ\r\n\r\n          (IV″) curl E = - _d_B/_dt_, Div B = 0 (V′)\r\n\r\nThen for moving non-magnetised bodies, Lorentz puts (page 223, 3) μ = 1,\r\nB = H, and in addition to that takes account of the occurrence of the\r\ndi-electric constant ε, and conductivity σ according to equations\r\n\r\n             (ε_q_XXXIV″, p. 327) D - E = (ε - 1) {E + [_u_B]}\r\n\r\n             (ε_q_XXXIII′, p. 223) J = σ(E + [_u_B])\r\n\r\nLorentz’s E, D, H are here denoted by E, M, _e_, _m_ while J denotes the\r\nconduction current.\r\n\r\nThe three last equations which have been just cited here coincide with\r\neqn (II), (III), (IV), the first equation would be, if J is identified\r\nwith C, = _u_ρ (the current being zero for σ = 0,\r\n\r\n          (29) Curl [H - (_u_, E)] = C + _d_D/_dt_ - curl [_u_D],\r\n\r\nand thus comes out to be in a different form than (1) here. Therefore\r\nfor magnetised bodies, Lorentz’s equations do not correspond to the\r\nRelativity Principle.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the form corresponding to the relativity principle,\r\nfor the condition of non-magnetisation is to be taken out of (D) in §8,\r\nwith μ = 1, not as B = H, as Lorentz takes, but as (30) B - [_u_D] = H -\r\n[_u_D] (M - [_u_E] = _m_ - [_ue_]. Now by putting H = B, the\r\ndifferential equation (29) is transformed into the same form as eqn (1)\r\nhere when _m_ - [_ue_] = M - [_u_E]. Therefore it so happens that by a\r\ncompensation of two contradictions to the relativity principle, the\r\ndifferential equations of Lorentz for moving non-magnetised bodies at\r\nlast agree with the relativity postulate.\r\n\r\nIf we make use of (30) for non-magnetic bodies, and put accordingly H =\r\nB + [_u_, (D - E)], then in consequence of (C) in §8,\r\n\r\n           (ε - 1) (E + [_u_, B]) = D - E + [_u_. [_u_, D - E]],\r\n\r\n_i.e._ for the direction of _u_,\r\n\r\n                 (ε - 1) (E + [_u_B])_{_u_} = (D - E)_{_u_}\r\n\r\nand for a perpendicular direction ū,\r\n\r\n           (ε - 1) [E + (_u_B)]_{_u_} = (1 - _u²_) (D - E)_{_u_}\r\n\r\n_i.e._ it coincides with Lorentz’s assumption, if we neglect _u²_ in\r\ncomparison to 1.\r\n\r\nAlso to the same order of approximation, Lorentz’s form for J\r\ncorresponds to the conditions imposed by the relativity principle [comp.\r\n(E) § 8]—that the components of J_{_u_}, J_{_ū_} are equal to the\r\ncomponents of σ (E + [_u_ B]) multiplied by √(1 - _u²_) or 1 / √(1 -\r\n_u²_) respectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 §10. Fundamental Equations of E. Cohn.\r\n\r\n\r\nE. Cohn assumes the following fundamental equations.\r\n\r\n           (31) Curl (M + [_u_ E]) = _d_E/_dt_ + u div. E + J\r\n\r\n           - Curl [E - (_u_. M)] = _d_M/_dt_ + u div. M.\r\n\r\n           (32) J = σ E, = ε E - [_u_ M], M = μ (_m_ + [_u_ E.])\r\n\r\nwhere E M are the electric and magnetic field intensities (forces), E, M\r\nare the electric and magnetic polarisation (induction). The equations\r\nalso permit the existence of true magnetism; if we do not take into\r\naccount this consideration, div. M. is to be put = 0.\r\n\r\nAn objection to this system of equations, is that according to these,\r\nfor ε = 1, μ = 1, the vectors force and induction do not coincide. If in\r\nthe equations, we conceive E and M and not E - (U. M), and M + [U E] as\r\nelectric and magnetic forces, and with a glance to this we substitute\r\nfor E, M, E, M, div. E, the symbols _e_, M, E + [U M], _m_ - [_u_ _e_],\r\nρ, then the differential equations transform to our equations, and the\r\nconditions (32) transform into\r\n\r\n              J = σ(E + [_u_ M])\r\n              _e_ + [_u_, (_m_ - [_u_ _e_])] = ε(E + [_u_ M])\r\n              M - [_u_, (E + _u_ M)] = μ(_m_ - [_u_ _e_])\r\n\r\nthen in fact the equations of Cohn become the same as those required by\r\nthe relativity principle, if errors of the order _u²_ are neglected in\r\ncomparison to 1.\r\n\r\nIt may be mentioned here that the equations of Hertz become the same as\r\nthose of Cohn, if the auxiliary conditions are\r\n\r\n                        (33) E = εE, M = μM, J = σE.\r\n\r\n\r\n       §11. Typical Representations of the Fundamental Equations.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the statement of the fundamental equations, our leading idea had been\r\nthat they should retain a covariance of form, when subjected to a group\r\nof Lorentz-transformations. Now we have to deal with ponderomotive\r\nreactions and energy in the electro-magnetic field. Here from the very\r\nfirst there can be no doubt that the settlement of this question is in\r\nsome way connected with the simplest forms which can be given to the\r\nfundamental equations, satisfying the conditions of covariance. In order\r\nto arrive at such forms, I shall first of all put the fundamental\r\nequations in a typical form which brings out clearly their covariance in\r\ncase of a Lorentz-transformation.

For a\r\nmoment we shall not suppose any special relation to hold between the\r\nunit of length and the unit of time, so that instead of _t_, _t′_, _q_,\r\nwe shall write _ct_, _ct′_, and _q_/_c_, where _c_ represents a certain\r\npositive constant, and _q_ is < _c_. The above mentioned equations are\r\ntransformed into\r\n\r\n             _r′__{_ṽ_} = _r__{_ṽ_},\r\n             _r′__{_v_} = _c_(_r__{_v_} - _qt_)/√(_c²_ - _q²_),\r\n             _t′_ = (_qr__{_v_} + _c²__t_)/_c_√(_c²_ - _q²_)\r\n\r\nThey denote, as we remember, that _r_ is the space-vector (_x_, _y_,\r\n_z_), _r′_ is the space-vector (_x′_ _y′_ _z′_)\r\n\r\nIf in these equations, keeping _v_ constant we approach the limit _c_ =\r\n∞, then we obtain from these\r\n\r\n                       _r′__{_ṽ_} = _r__{_ṽ_},\r\n                       _r′__{_v_} = _r__{_v_} - _qt_,\r\n                       _t′_ = _t_.\r\n\r\nThe new equations would now denote the transformation of a spatial\r\nco-ordinate system (_x_, _y_, _z_) to another spatial co-ordinate system\r\n(_x′_ _y′_ _z′_) with parallel axes, the null point of the second system\r\nmoving with constant velocity in a straight line, while the time\r\nparameter remains unchanged. We can, therefore, say that classical\r\nmechanics postulates a covariance of Physical laws for the group of\r\nhomogeneous linear transformations of the expression\r\n\r\n                     -_x²_ - _y²_ - _z²_ + _c²_     (1)\r\n\r\nwhen _c_ = ∞.\r\n\r\nNow it is rather confusing to find that in one branch of Physics, we\r\nshall find a covariance of the laws for the transformation of expression\r\n(1) with a finite value of _c_, in another part for _c_ = ∞.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that according to Newtonian Mechanics, this covariance\r\nholds for _c_ = ∞ and not for _c_ = velocity of light.\r\n\r\nMay we not then regard those traditional covariances for _c_ = ∞ only as\r\nan approximation consistent with experience, the actual covariance of\r\nnatural laws holding for a certain finite value of _c_.\r\n\r\nI may here point out that by if instead of the Newtonian\r\nRelativity-Postulate with _c_ = ∞, we assume a relativity-postulate with\r\na finite _c_, then the axiomatic construction of Mechanics appears to\r\ngain considerably in perfection.\r\n\r\nThe ratio of the time unit to the length unit is chosen in a manner so\r\nas to make the velocity of light equivalent to unity.\r\n\r\nWhile now I want to introduce geometrical figures in the manifold of the\r\nvariables (_x_, _y_, _z_, _t_), it may be convenient to leave (_y_, _z_)\r\nout of account, and to treat _x_ and _t_ as any possible pair of\r\nco-ordinates in a plane, referred to oblique axes.\r\n\r\nA space time null point 0 (_x_, _y_, _z_, _t_ = 0, 0, 0, 0) will be kept\r\nfixed in a Lorentz transformation.\r\n\r\n        The figure -_x²_ - _y²_ - _z²_ + _t²_ = 1, _t_ > 0 ...  (2)\r\n\r\nwhich represents a hyper boloidal shell, contains the space-time points\r\nA (_x_, _y_, _z_, _t_ = 0, 0, 0, 1), and all points A′ which after a\r\nLorentz-transformation enter into the newly introduced system of\r\nreference as (_x′_, _y′_, _z′_, _t′_ = 0, 0, 0, 1).\r\n\r\nThe direction of a radius vector 0A′ drawn from 0 to the point A′ of\r\n(2), and the directions of the tangents to (2) at A′ are to be called\r\nnormal to each other.\r\n\r\nLet us now follow a definite position of matter in its course through\r\nall time _t_. The totality of the space-time points (_x_, _y_, _z_, _t_)\r\nwhich correspond to the positions at different times _t_, shall be\r\ncalled a space-time line.\r\n\r\nThe task of determining the motion of matter is comprised in the\r\nfollowing problem:—It is required to establish for every space-time\r\npoint the direction of the space-time line passing through it.\r\n\r\nTo transform a space-time point P (_x_, _y_, _z_, _t_) to rest is\r\nequivalent to introducing, by means of a Lorentz transformation, a new\r\nsystem of reference (_x′_, _y′_, _z′_, _t′_), in which the _t′_ axis has\r\nthe direction 0A′, 0A′ indicating the direction of the space-time line\r\npassing through P. The space _t′_ = const, which is to be laid through\r\nP, is the one which is perpendicular to the space-time line through P.\r\n\r\nTo the increment _dt_ of the time of P corresponds the increment\r\n\r\n         _d_τ = √(_dt²_ - _dx²_ - _dy²_) - _dz²_ = _dt_√(1 - _u²_)\r\n\r\nof the newly introduced time parameter _t′_. The value of the integral\r\n\r\n             ∫ _dτ_ = ∫ √(-(_dx₁²_ + _dx₂²_ + _dx₃²_ + _dx₄²_))\r\n\r\nwhen calculated upon the space-time line from a fixed initial point P₀\r\nto the variable point P, (both being on the space-time line), is known\r\nas the ‘Proper-time’ of the position of matter we are concerned with at\r\nthe space-time point P. (It is a generalization of the idea of\r\nPositional-time which was introduced by Lorentz for uniform motion.)\r\n\r\nIf we take a body R₀ which has got extension in space at time _t₀_, then\r\nthe region comprising all the space-time line passing through R₀ and\r\n_t₀_ shall be called a space-time filament.\r\n\r\nIf we have an analytical expression θ(_x_ _y_, _z_, _t_) so that θ(_x_,\r\n_y_ _z_ _t_) = 0 is intersected by every space time line of the filament\r\nat one point,—whereby\r\n\r\n                   -(∂Θ/∂_x_)², -(∂Θ/∂_y_)², -(∂Θ/∂_z_)²,\r\n                   -(∂Θ/∂_t_)² > 0, ∂Θ/∂_t_ > 0.\r\n\r\nthen the totality of the intersecting points will be called a cross\r\nsection of the filament.\r\n\r\nAt any point P of such across-section, we can introduce by means of a\r\nLorentz transformation a system of reference (_x′_, _y_, _z′_ _t_), so\r\nthat according to this\r\n\r\n          ∂Θ/∂_x′_ = 0, ∂Θ/∂_y′_ = 0, ∂Θ/∂_z′_ = 0, ∂Θ/∂_t′_ > 0.\r\n\r\nThe direction of the uniquely determined _t′_—axis in question here is\r\nknown as the upper normal of the cross-section at the point P and the\r\nvalue of _d_J = ∫∫∫ _dx′ dy′ dz′_ for the surrounding points of P on the\r\ncross-section is known as the elementary contents (Inhalts-element) of\r\nthe cross-section. In this sense R₀ is to be regarded as the\r\ncross-section normal to the _t_ axis of the filament at the point _t_ =\r\n_t₀_, and the volume of the body R₀ is to be regarded as the contents of\r\nthe cross-section.\r\n\r\nIf we allow R₀ to converge to a point, we come to the conception of an\r\ninfinitely thin space-time filament. In such a case, a space-time line\r\nwill be thought of as a principal line and by the term ‘Proper-time’ of\r\nthe filament will be understood the ‘Proper-time’ which is laid along\r\nthis principal line; under the term normal cross-section of the\r\nfilament, we shall understand the cross-section upon the space which is\r\nnormal to the principal line through P.\r\n\r\nWe shall now formulate the principle of conservation of mass.\r\n\r\nTo every space R at a time _t_, belongs a positive quantity—the mass at\r\nR at the time _t_. If R converges to a point (_x_, _y_, _z_, _t_), then\r\nthe quotient of this mass, and the volume of R approaches a limit μ(_x_,\r\n_y_, _z_, _t_), which is known as the mass-density at the space-time\r\npoint (_x_, _y_, _z_, _t_).\r\n\r\nThe principle of conservation of mass says—that for an infinitely thin\r\nspace-time filament, the product μ_d_J, where μ = mass-density at the\r\npoint (_x_, _y_, _z_, _t_) of the filament (_i.e._, the principal line\r\nof the filament), _d_J = contents of the cross-section normal to the _t_\r\naxis, and passing through (_x_, _y_, _z_, _t_), is constant along the\r\nwhole filament.\r\n\r\nNow the contents _d_J_{n} of the normal cross-section of the filament\r\nwhich is laid through (_x_, _y_, _z_, _t_) is\r\n\r\n    (4) _d_J_{n} = (1/√(1 - _u²_))_d_J = -_i_ω₄ _d_J = (_dt_/_d_τ)_d_J.\r\n\r\nand the function\r\n\r\n               ν = μ/-_i_ω₄ = μ√(1 - _u²_)) = μ(∂τ/∂_t_. (5)\r\n\r\nmay be defined as the rest-mass density at the position (_x_ _y_ _z_\r\n_t_). Then the principle of conservation of mass can be formulated in\r\nthis manner:—\r\n\r\n_For an infinitely thin space-time filament, the product of the\r\nrest-mass density and the contents of the normal cross-section is\r\nconstant along the whole filament._\r\n\r\nIn any space-time filament, let us consider two cross-sections Q° and\r\nQ′, which have only the points on the boundary common to each other; let\r\nthe space-time lines inside the filament have a larger value of _t_ on\r\nQ′ than on Q°. The finite range enclosed between Q° and Q′ shall be\r\ncalled a space-time _sichel_,[29] Q′ is the lower boundary, and Q′ is\r\nthe upper boundary of the _sichel_.\r\n\r\nIf we decompose a filament into elementary space-time filaments, then to\r\nan entrance-point of an elementary filament through the lower boundary\r\nof the _sichel_, there corresponds an exit point of the same by the\r\nupper boundary, whereby for both, the product νdJ_{n} taken in the sense\r\nof (4) and (5), has got the same value. Therefore the difference of the\r\ntwo integrals ∫ν_dJ__{n} (the first being extended over the upper, the\r\nsecond upon the lower boundary) vanishes. According to a well-known\r\ntheorem of Integral Calculus the difference is equivalent to\r\n\r\n                       ∫∫∫∫ lor ν[=ω] _dx dy dz dt_,\r\n\r\nthe integration being extended over the whole range of the _sichel_, and\r\n(comp.

We shall\r\ndecompose the _sichel_ into elementary space-time filaments, and every\r\none of these filaments in small elements _d_τ of its proper-time, which\r\nare however large compared to the linear dimensions of the normal\r\ncross-section; let us assume that the mass of such a filament\r\nν_d_J_{_n_} = _dm_ and write τ⁰, τ^l for the ‘Proper-time’ of the upper\r\nand lower boundary of the _sichel_.\r\n\r\nThen the integral (7) can be denoted by\r\n\r\n                   ∫∫ ν_d_J_{_n_} _d_τ = ∫ (τ′-τ⁰) _dm_.\r\n\r\ntaken over all the elements of the sichel.\r\n\r\nNow let us conceive of the space-time lines inside a space-time _sichel_\r\nas material curves composed of material points, and let us suppose that\r\nthey are subjected to a continual change of length inside the sichel in\r\nthe following manner. The entire curves are to be varied in any possible\r\nmanner inside the _sichel_, while the end points on the lower and upper\r\nboundaries remain fixed, and the individual substantial points upon it\r\nare displaced in such a manner that they always move forward normal to\r\nthe curves. The whole process may be analytically represented by means\r\nof a parameter λ, and to the value λ = 0, shall correspond the actual\r\ncurves inside the _sichel_. Such a process may be called a virtual\r\ndisplacement in the sichel.\r\n\r\nLet the point (_x_, _y_, _z_, _t_) in the sichel λ = 0 have the values\r\n_x_ + δ_x_, _y_ + δ_y_, _z_ + δ_z_, _t_ + δ_t_, when the parameter has\r\nthe value λ; these magnitudes are then functions of (_x_, _y_, _z_, _t_,\r\nλ). Let us now conceive of an infinitely thin space-time filament at the\r\npoint (_x_ _y_ _z_ _t_) with the normal section of contents _d_J_{_n_}\r\nand if _d_J_{_n_} + δ_d_J_{_n_} be the contents of the normal section at\r\nthe corresponding position of the varied filament, then according to the\r\nprinciple of conservation of mass—(ν + _d_ν being the rest-mass-density\r\nat the varied position),\r\n\r\n       (8) (ν + δν) (_d_J_{_n_} + δ_d_J_{_n_}) = ν_d_J_{_n_} = _dm_.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of this condition, the integral (7) taken over the whole\r\nrange of the _sichel_, varies on account of the displacement as a\r\ndefinite function N + δN of λ, and we may call this function N + δN as\r\nthe _mass action_ of the virtual displacement.\r\n\r\nIf we now introduce the method of writing with indices, we shall have\r\n\r\n    (9) _d_(_x__{_h_} + δ_x__{_h_}) = _dx__{_h_} + ∑_{_k_}\r\n       ∂δ_x__{_h_}/∂_x__{_k_} + ∂δ_x__{_h_}/∂λ _d_λ\r\n\r\n    _k_ = 1, 2, 3, 4\r\n    _h_ = 1, 2, 3, 4\r\n\r\nNow on the basis of the remarks already made, it is clear that the value\r\nof N + δN, when the value of the parameter is λ, will be:—\r\n\r\n        (10) N + δN = ∫∫∫∫ ((ν_d_(τ + δτ))/_d_τ)_dx_ _dy_ _dz_ _dt_,\r\n\r\nthe integration extending over the whole sichel _d_(τ + δτ) where _d_(τ\r\n+ δτ) denotes the magnitude, which is deduced from\r\n\r\n    √(-(_dx₁_ + _d_δ_x₁_)² - (_dx₂_ + _d_δ_x₂_)² - (_dx₃_ + _d_δ_x₃_)² -\r\n       (_dx₄_ + _d_δ_x₄_)²)\r\n\r\nby means of (9) and\r\n\r\n                 _dx₁_ = ω₁ _d_τ, _dx₂_ = ω₂ _d_τ,\r\n                 _dx₃_ = ω₃ _d_τ, _dx₄_ = ω₄ _d_τ, _d_λ = 0\r\n\r\ntherefore:—\r\n\r\n    (11) (_d_(τ + δτ))/_d_τ = √( -∑(ω_{_h_} +\r\n       ∑(∂δ_x__{_h_}/∂_x__{_k_})ω_{_k_})²)\r\n\r\n    _k_ = 1, 2, 3, 4.\r\n    _h_ = 1, 2, 3, 4.\r\n\r\nWe shall now subject the value of the differential quotient\r\n\r\n                     (12) ((_d_(N + δN))/_d_λ) (λ = 0)\r\n\r\nto a transformation. Since each δ_x__{_h_} as a function of (_x_, _y_,\r\n_z_, _t_) vanishes for the zero-value of the parameter λ, so in general\r\n_d_δ_x__{_k_}/(∂_x__{_h_} = 0, for λ = 0.\r\n\r\nLet us now put (∂δ_x__{_h_}/∂λ) = ξ_{_h_} (_h_ = 1, 2, 3, 4) (13)\r\n\r\nλ = 0\r\n\r\nthen on the basis of (10) and (11), we have the expression (12):—\r\n\r\n      = -∫∫∫∫ ∑ ω_{_h_}((∂ξ_{_h_}/∂_x₁_)ω₁ + (∂ξ_{_h_}/∂_x₂_)ω₂\r\n         +(∂ξ_{_h_}/∂_x₃_)ω₃ + (∂ξ_{_h_}/∂_x₄_)ω₄)\r\n    _dx dy dz dt_\r\n\r\nfor the system (_x₁_ _x₂_ _x₃_ _x₄_) on the boundary of the _sichel_,\r\n(δ_x₁_ δ_x₂_ δ_x₃_ δ_x₄_) shall vanish for every value of λ and\r\ntherefore ξ₁, ξ₂, ξ₃, ξ₄ are nil. Then by partial integration, the\r\nintegral is transformed into the form\r\n\r\n    ∫∫∫∫ ∑ ξ_{_h_}(∂νω_{_h_}ω₁/∂_x₁_ + ∂νω_{_h_}ω₂/∂_x₂_ +\r\n       ∂νω_{_h_}ω₃/∂_x₃_ + ∂νω_{_h_}ω₄/∂_x₄_)\r\n    _dx dy dz dt_\r\n\r\nthe expression within the bracket may be written as\r\n\r\n      = ω_{_h_} ∑ ∂νω_{_k_}/∂_x__{_k_} + ν∑ω_{_k_}∂ω_{_h_}/∂_x__{_k_}.\r\n\r\nThe first sum vanishes in consequence of the continuity equation (_b_).\r\nThe second may be written as\r\n\r\n    (∂ω_{_h_}/∂_x₁_)(_dx₁_/_d_τ) + (∂ω_{_h_}/∂_x₂_)(_dx₂_/_d_τ) +\r\n       (∂ω_{_h_}/∂_x₃_)(_dx₃_/_d_τ) + (∂ω_{_h_}/∂_x₄_)(_dx₄_/_d_τ)\r\n\r\n       = _d_ω_{_h_}/_d_τ = (_d_/_d_τ)(_dx__{_h_}/_d_τ)\r\n\r\nwhereby (_d_/_d_τ) is meant the differential quotient in the direction\r\nof the space-time line at any position. For the differential quotient\r\n(12), we obtain the final expression\r\n\r\n       (14) ∫∫∫∫ ν((∂ω₁/∂τ)ξ₁ + (∂ω₂/∂τ)ξ₂ + (∂ω₃/∂τ)ξ₃ + (∂ω₄/∂τ)ξ₄)\r\n\r\n       _dx dy dz dt_.\r\n\r\nFor a virtual displacement in the _sichel_ we have postulated the\r\ncondition that the points supposed to be substantial shall advance\r\nnormally to the curves giving their actual motion, which is λ = 0; this\r\ncondition denotes that the ξ_{_h_} is to satisfy the condition\r\n\r\n                _w₁_ξ₁ + _w₂_ξ₂ + _w₃_ξ₃ + _w₄_ξ₄ = 0. (15)\r\n\r\nLet us now turn our attention to the Maxwellian tensions in the\r\nelectrodynamics of stationary bodies, and let us consider the results in\r\n§ 12 and 13; then we find that Hamilton’s Principle can be reconciled to\r\nthe relativity postulate for continuously extended elastic media.\r\n\r\nAt every space-time point (as in § 13), let a space time matrix of the\r\n2nd kind be known\r\n\r\n    (16) S =\r\n    | S₁₁ S₁₂ S₁₃ S₁₄ | = | X_{_x_} Y_{_x_} Z_{_x_} -_i_T_{_x_} |\r\n\r\n    | S₂₁ S₂₂ S₂₃ S₂₄ | = | X_{_y_} Y_{_y_} Z_{_y_} -_i_T_{_y_} |\r\n\r\n    | S₃₁ S₃₂ S₃₃ S₃₄ | = | X_{_z_} Y_{_z_} Z_{_z_} -_i_T_{_z_} |\r\n\r\n    | S₄₁ S₄₂ S₄₃ S₄₄ | = | -_i_X_{_t_} -_i_Y_{_t_} -_i_Z_{_t_} T_{_t_}\r\n       |\r\n\r\nwhere X_{_n_} Y_{_x_} .....X_{_z_}, T_{_t_} are real magnitudes.\r\n\r\nFor a virtual displacement in a space-time sichel (with the previously\r\napplied designation) the value of the integral\r\n\r\n    (17) W + δW = ∫∫∫∫ (∑S_{_h k_} (∂(_x__{_k_} +\r\n       δ_x__{_k_}))/∂_x__{_h_} _dx dy dz dt_\r\n\r\nextended over the whole range of the _sichel_, may be called the\r\ntensional work of the virtual displacement.\r\n\r\nThe sum which comes forth here, written in real magnitudes, is\r\n\r\n    X_{_x_} + Y_{_y_} + Z_{_z_} + T_{_t_} + X_{_x_} (∂δ_x_)/∂_x_ +\r\n       X_{_y_} (∂δ_x_)/∂_y_ + ...

T_{_t_}\r\n       (∂δ_t_)/∂_t_\r\n\r\nwe can now postulate the following _minimum principle in mechanics_.\r\n\r\n_If any space-time Sichel be bounded, then for each virtual displacement\r\nin the Sichel, the sum of the mass-works, and tension works shall always\r\nbe an extremum for that process of the space-time line in the Sichel\r\nwhich actually occurs._\r\n\r\nThe meaning is, that for each virtual displacement,\r\n\r\n                  ([_d_(·δN + δW)]/_d_λ)_{λ = 0} = 0 (18)\r\n\r\nBy applying the methods of the Calculus of Variations, the following\r\nfour differential equations at once follow from this minimal principle\r\nby means of the transformation (14), and the condition (15).\r\n\r\n    (19) ν ∂_w__{_h_}/∂τ = K_{_h_} + χ_w__{_h_} (_h_ = 1, 2, 3, 4)\r\n\r\n    whence K_{_h_} = ∂S_{1 _h_}/∂_x₁_ + ∂S_{2 _h_}/∂_x₂_ + ∂S_{3\r\n       _h_}/∂_x₃_ + ∂S_{4 _h_}/∂_x₄_, (20)\r\n\r\nare components of the space-time vector 1st kind K = lor S, and X is a\r\nfactor, which is to be determined from the relation _w__ẇ_ = - 1. By\r\nmultiplying (19) by _w__{_h_}, and summing the four, we obtain X = K_ẇ_,\r\nand therefore clearly K + (K_ẇ_)_w_ will be a space-time vector of the\r\n1st kind which is normal to _w_. Let us write out the components of this\r\nvector as\r\n\r\n                               X, Y, Z, ·_i_T\r\n\r\nThen we arrive at the following equation for the motion of matter,\r\n\r\n    (21) ν _d_/_d_τ (_dx_/_d_τ) = X, ν _d_/_d_τ (_dy_/_d_τ) = Y, ν\r\n       _d_/_d_τ (_dz_/_d_τ) = Z,\r\n\r\n    ν _d_/_d_τ (_dx_/_d_τ) = T, and we have also\r\n\r\n    (_dx_/_d_τ)² + (_dy_/_d_τ)² + (_dz_/_d_τ)² > (_dt_/_d_τ)² = -1,\r\n\r\n    and X _dx_/_d_τ + Y _dy_/_d_τ + Z _dz_/_d_τ = T _dt_/_d_τ.\r\n\r\nOn the basis of this condition, the fourth of equations (21) is to be\r\nregarded as a direct consequence of the first three.\r\n\r\nFrom (21), we can deduce the law for the motion of a material point,\r\n_i.e._, the law for the career of an infinitely thin space-time\r\nfilament.\r\n\r\nLet _x_, _y_, _z_, _t_, denote a point on a principal line chosen in any\r\nmanner within the filament. We shall form the equations (21) for the\r\npoints of the normal cross section of the filament through _x_, _y_,\r\n_z_, _t_, and integrate them, multiplying by the elementary contents of\r\nthe cross section over the whole space of the normal section. If the\r\nintegrals of the right side be R_{_x_} R_{_y_} R_{_z_} R_{_t_} and if\r\n_m_ be the constant mass of the filament, we obtain\r\n\r\n                   (22) _m_ _d_/_d_τ _dx_/_d_τ = R_{_x_},\r\n                        _m_ _d_/_d_τ _dy_/_d_τ = R_{_y_},\r\n                        _m_ _d_/_d_τ _dz_/_d_τ = R_{_z_},\r\n                        _m_ _d_/_d_τ _dt_/_d_τ = R_{_t_}\r\n\r\nR is now a space-time vector of the 1st kind with the components\r\n(R_{_x_} R_{_y_} R_{_z_} R_{_t_}) which is normal to the space-time\r\nvector of the 1st kind _w_,—the velocity of the material point with the\r\ncomponents\r\n\r\n              _dx_/_d_τ, _dy_/_d_τ, _dz_/_d_τ, _i_ _dt_/_d_τ.\r\n\r\nWe may call this vector R _the moving force of the material point_.\r\n\r\nIf instead of integrating over the normal section, we integrate the\r\nequations over that cross section of the filament which is normal to the\r\n_t_ axis, and passes through (_x_, _y_, _z_, _t_), then [See (4)] the\r\nequations (22) are obtained, but\r\n\r\nare now multiplied by _d_τ/_dt_; in particular, the last equation comes\r\nout in the form,\r\n\r\n    _m_ _d_/_dt_ (_dt_/_d_τ) = _w__{_x_} R_{_x_} _d_τ/_dt_ + _w__{_y_}\r\n       R_{_y_} _d_τ/_dt_ + _w__{_z_} R_{_z_} _d_τ/_dt_.\r\n\r\nThe right side is to be looked upon _as the amount of work done per unit\r\nof time_ at the material point. In this equation, we obtain the\r\nenergy-law for the motion of the material point and the expression\r\n\r\n               _m_ (_dt_/_d_τ - 1) = _m_ [1/√(1 - _w²_) - 1]\r\n                 = _m_ (½ |_w₁²_  + 3/8 |_w₁⁴_ + )\r\n\r\nmay be called the kinetic energy of the material point.\r\n\r\nSince _dt_ is always greater than _d_τ we may call the quotient (_dt_ -\r\n_d_τ)/_d_τ as the “Gain” (vorgehen) of the time over the proper-time of\r\nthe material point and the law can then be thus expressed;—The kinetic\r\nenergy of a material point is the product of its mass into the gain of\r\nthe time over its proper-time.\r\n\r\nThe set of four equations (22) again shows the symmetry in (_x_, _y_,\r\n_z_, _t_), which is demanded by the relativity postulate; to the fourth\r\nequation however, a higher physical significance is to be attached, as\r\nwe have already seen in the analogous case in electrodynamics. On the\r\nground of this demand for symmetry, the triplet consisting of the first\r\nthree equations are to be constructed after the model of the fourth;\r\nremembering this circumstance, we are justified in saying,—\r\n\r\n“If the relativity-postulate be placed at the head of mechanics, then\r\nthe whole set of laws of motion follows from the law of energy.”\r\n\r\nI cannot refrain from showing that no contradiction to the assumption on\r\nthe relativity-postulate can be expected from the phenomena of\r\ngravitation.\r\n\r\nIf B*(_x_*, _y_*, _z_*, _t_*) be a solid (fester) space-time point, then\r\nthe region of all those space-time points B (_x_, _y_, _z_, _t_), for\r\nwhich\r\n\r\n     (23) (_x_ - _x_*)² + (_y_ - _y_*)² + (_z_ - _z_*)² = (_t_ - _t_*)²\r\n\r\n     _t_ - _t_* >= 0\r\n\r\nmay be called a “Ray-figure” (Strahl-gebilde) of the space time point\r\nB*.\r\n\r\nA space-time line taken in any manner can be cut by this figure only at\r\none particular point; this easily follows from the convexity of the\r\nfigure on the one hand, and on the other hand from the fact that all\r\ndirections of the space-time lines are only directions from B* towards\r\nto the concave side of the figure. Then B* may be called the light-point\r\nof B.\r\n\r\nIf in (23), the point (_x_ _y_ _z_ _t_) be supposed to be fixed, the\r\npoint (_x_* _y_* _z_* _t_*) be supposed to be variable, then the\r\nrelation (23) would represent the locus of all the space-time points B*,\r\nwhich are light-points of B.\r\n\r\nLet us conceive that a material point F of mass _m_ may, owing to the\r\npresence of another material point F*, experience a moving force\r\naccording to the following law. Let us picture to ourselves the\r\nspace-time filaments of F and F* along with the principal lines of the\r\nfilaments. Let BC be an infinitely small element of the principal line\r\nof F; further let B* be the light point of B, C* be the light point of C\r\non the principal line of F*; so that OA′ is the radius vector of the\r\nhyperboloidal fundamental figure (23) parallel to B*C*, finally D* is\r\nthe point of intersection of line B*C* with the space normal to itself\r\nand passing through B. The moving force of the mass-point F in the\r\nspace-time point B is now the space-time vector of the first kind which\r\nis normal to BC, and which is composed of the vectors\r\n\r\n(24) _mm_*(OA′/B*D*)³ BD* in the direction of BD*, and another vector of\r\nsuitable value in direction of B*C*.\r\n\r\nNow by (OA′/B*D*) is to be understood the ratio of the two vectors in\r\nquestion. It is clear that this proposition at once shows the covariant\r\ncharacter with respect to a Lorentz-group.\r\n\r\nLet us now ask how the space-time filament of F behaves when the\r\nmaterial point F* has a uniform translatory motion, _i.e._, the\r\nprincipal line of the filament of F* is a line. Let us take the space\r\ntime null-point in this, and by means of a Lorentz-transformation, we\r\ncan take this axis as the t-axis. Let _x_, _y_, _z_, _t_, denote the\r\npoint B, let τ* denote the proper time of B*, reckoned from O. Our\r\nproposition leads to the equations\r\n\r\n    (25) _d²__x_/_d_τ² = - _m_*_x_/(_t_ - τ*)², _d²__y_/_d_τ² = -\r\n       _m_*_y_/(_t_ - τ*)³\r\n\r\n    _d²__z_/_d_τ² = -_m_*_z_/(_t_ - τ*)³,\r\n    (26) _d²__t_/_d_τ² = -_m_*/(_t_ - τ*)² _d_(_t_ - τ*)/_dt_\r\n\r\nwhere (27) _x²_ + _y²_ + _z²_ = (_t_ - τ*)²\r\n\r\nand (28) (_dx_/_d_τ)² + (_dy_/_d_τ)² + (_dz_/_d_τ)² = (_dt_/_d_τ)² - 1.\r\n\r\nIn consideration of (27), the three equations (25) are of the same form\r\nas the equations for the motion of a material point subjected to\r\nattraction from a fixed centre according to the Newtonian Law, only that\r\ninstead of the time _t_, the proper time τ of the material point occurs.\r\nThe fourth equation (26) gives then the connection between proper time\r\nand the time for the material point.\r\n\r\nNow for different values of τ′, the orbit of the space-point (_x_ _y_\r\n_z_) is an ellipse with the semi-major axis _a_ and the eccentricity\r\n_e_. Let E denote the eccentric anomaly, Τ the increment of the proper\r\ntime for a complete description of the orbit, finally _n_Τ = 2π, so that\r\nfrom a properly chosen initial point τ, we have the Kepler-equation\r\n\r\n                         (29) _n_τ = E - _e_ sin E.\r\n\r\nIf we now change the unit of time, and denote the velocity of light by\r\n_c_, then from (28), we obtain\r\n\r\n              (30) (_dt_/_d_τ)² - 1\r\n                = (_m_*/_ac²_) (1 + _e_ cos E)/(1 - _e_ cos E)\r\n\r\nNow neglecting _c⁻⁴_ with regard to 1, it follows that\r\n\r\n     _ndt_ = _nd_τ [ 1 + ½ _m_*/_ac²_ (1 + _e_ cos E)/(1 - _e_ cos E) ]\r\n\r\nfrom which, by applying (29),\r\n\r\n      (31) _nt_ + const = (1 + ½ _m_*/_ac²_) _n_τ + _m_*/_ac²_ Sin E.\r\n\r\nthe factor _m_*/_ac²_ is here the square of the ratio of a certain\r\naverage velocity of F in its orbit to the velocity of light. If now _m_*\r\ndenote the mass of the sun, _a_ the semi major axis of the earth’s\r\norbit, then this factor amounts to 10⁻⁸.\r\n\r\nThe law of mass attraction which has been just described and which is\r\nformulated in accordance with the relativity postulate would signify\r\nthat gravitation is propagated with the velocity of light. In view of\r\nthe fact that the periodic terms in (31) are very small, it is not\r\npossible to decide out of astronomical observations between such a law\r\n(with the modified mechanics proposed above) and the Newtonian law of\r\nattraction with Newtonian mechanics.\r\n\r\nFootnote 29:\r\n\r\n  Sichel—a German word meaning a crescent or a scythe.

Herein lies its\r\nstrength. The tendency is radical. Henceforth, the old conception of\r\nspace for itself, and time for itself shall reduce to a mere shadow, and\r\nsome sort of union of the two will be found consistent with facts.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   I\r\n\r\n\r\nNow I want to show you how we can arrive at the changed concepts about\r\ntime and space from mechanics, as accepted now-a-days, from purely\r\nmathematical considerations. The equations of Newtonian mechanics show a\r\ntwofold invariance, (_i_) their form remains unaltered when we subject\r\nthe fundamental space-coordinate system to any possible change of\r\nposition, (_ii_) when we change the system in its nature of motion, _i.\r\ne._, when we impress upon it any uniform motion of translation, the\r\nnull-point of time plays no part. We are accustomed to look upon the\r\naxioms of geometry as settled once for all, while we seldom have the\r\nsame amount of conviction regarding the axioms of mechanics, and\r\ntherefore the two invariants are seldom mentioned in the same breath.\r\nEach one of these denotes a certain group of transformations for the\r\ndifferential equations of mechanics. We look upon the existence of the\r\nfirst group as a fundamental characteristics of space. We always prefer\r\nto leave off the second group to itself, and with a light heart conclude\r\nthat we can never decide from physical considerations whether the space,\r\nwhich is supposed to be at rest, may not finally be in uniform motion.\r\nSo these two groups lead quite separate existences besides each other.\r\nTheir totally heterogeneous character may scare us away from the attempt\r\nto compound them. Yet it is the whole compounded group which as a whole\r\ngives us occasion for thought.\r\n\r\nWe wish to picture to ourselves the whole relation graphically. Let\r\n(_x_, _y_, _z_) be the rectangular coordinates of space, and _t_ denote\r\nthe time. Subjects of our perception are always connected with place and\r\ntime. _No one has observed a place except at a particular time, or has\r\nobserved a time except at a particular place._ Yet I respect the dogma\r\nthat time and space have independent existences. I will call a\r\nspace-point plus a time-point, _i.e._, a system of values _x_, _y_, _z_,\r\n_t_, as a _world-point_. The manifoldness of all possible values of _x_,\r\n_y_, _z_, _t_, will be the _world_. I can draw four world-axes with the\r\nchalk. Now any axis drawn consists of quickly vibrating molecules, and\r\nbesides, takes part in all the journeys of the earth ; and therefore\r\ngives us occasion for reflection. The greater abstraction required for\r\nthe four-axes does not cause the mathematician any trouble. In order not\r\nto allow any yawning gap to exist, we shall suppose that at every place\r\nand time, something perceptible exists. In order not to specify either\r\nmatter or electricity, we shall simply style these as substances. We\r\ndirect our attention to the _world-point_ _x_, _y_, _z_, _t_, and\r\nsuppose that we are in a position to recognise this substantial point at\r\nany subsequent time. Let _dt_ be the time element corresponding to the\r\nchanges of space coordinates of this point [_dx_, _dy_, _dz_]. Then we\r\nobtain (as a picture, so to speak, of the perennial life-career of the\r\nsubstantial point),—a curve in the _world_—the _world-line_, the points\r\non which unambiguously correspond to the parameter _t_ from +∞ to -∞.\r\nThe whole world appears to be resolved in such _world-lines_, and I may\r\njust deviate from my point if I say that according to my opinion the\r\nphysical laws would find their fullest expression as mutual relations\r\namong these lines.\r\n\r\nBy this conception of time and space, the (_x_, _y_, _z_) manifoldness\r\n_t_ = 0 and its two sides _t_ < 0 and _t_ > 0 falls asunder. If for the\r\nsake of simplicity, we keep the null-point of time and space fixed, then\r\nthe first named group of mechanics signifies that at _t_ = 0 we can give\r\nthe _x_, _y_, and _z_-axes any possible rotation about the null-point\r\ncorresponding to the homogeneous linear transformation of the expression\r\n\r\n                            _x²_ + _y²_ + _z²_.\r\n\r\nThe second group denotes that without changing the expression for the\r\nmechanical laws, we can substitute (_x_ - α_t_, _y_ - β_t_, _z_ - γ_t_\r\nfor (_x_, _y_, _z_) where (α, β, γ) are any constants. According to this\r\nwe can give the time-axis any possible direction in the upper half of\r\nthe world _t_ > 0. Now what have the demands of orthogonality in space\r\nto do with this perfect freedom of the time-axis towards the upper half?\r\n\r\nTo establish this connection, let us take a positive parameter c, and\r\nlet us consider the figure\r\n\r\n                     _c²__t²_ - _x²_ - _y²_ - _z²_ = 1\r\n\r\nAccording to the analogy of the hyperboloid of two sheets, this consists\r\nof two sheets separated by _t_ = 0. Let us consider the sheet, in the\r\nregion of _t_ > 0, and let us now conceive the transformation of _x_,\r\n_y_, _z_, _t_ in the new system of variables; (_x’_, _y’_, _z’_, _t’_)\r\nby means of which the form of the expression will remain unaltered.\r\nClearly the rotation of space round the null-point belongs to this group\r\nof transformations. Now we can have a full idea of the transformations\r\nwhich we picture to ourselves from a particular transformation in which\r\n(_y_, _z_) remain unaltered. Let us draw the cross section of the upper\r\nsheets with the plane of the _x_- and _t_-axes, _i.e._, the upper half\r\nof the hyperbola _c²__t²_ - x² = 1, with its asymptotes (_vide_ fig. 1).\r\n\r\nThen let us draw the radius rector OA′, the tangent A′ B′ at A′, and let\r\nus complete the parallelogram OA′ B′ C′; also produce B′ C′ to meet the\r\nx-axis at D′. Let us now take Ox′, OA′ as new axes with the unit\r\nmeasuring rods OC′ = 1, OA′ = (1/c) ; then the hyperbola is again\r\nexpressed in the form _c²__t′²_ - x′² = 1, t′ > 0 and the transition\r\nfrom (_x_, _y_, _z_, _t_) to (_x′_ _y′_ _z′_ _t_) is one of the\r\ntransitions in question. Let us add to this characteristic\r\ntransformation any possible displacement of the space and time\r\nnull-points; then we get a group of transformation depending only on\r\n_c_, which we may denote by G_{_c_}.\r\n\r\nNow let us increase _c_ to infinity. Thus (1/c) becomes zero and it\r\nappears from the figure that the hyperbola is gradually shrunk into the\r\n_x_-axis, the asymptotic angle becomes a straight one, and every special\r\ntransformation in the limit changes in such a manner that the _t_-axis\r\ncan have any possible direction upwards, and _x′_ more and more\r\napproximates to _x_. Remembering this point it is clear that the full\r\ngroup belonging to Newtonian Mechanics is simply the group G_{_c_}, with\r\nthe value of _c_ = ∞. In this state of affairs, and since G_{_c_} is\r\nmathematically more intelligible than G_{∞}, a mathematician may, by a\r\nfree play of imagination, hit upon the thought that natural phenomena\r\npossess an invariance not only for the group G_{∞}, but in fact also for\r\na group G_{_c_}, where _c_ is finite, but yet exceedingly large compared\r\nto the usual measuring units. Such a preconception would be an\r\nextraordinary triumph for pure mathematics.\r\n\r\nAt the same time I shall remark for which value of _c_, this invariance\r\ncan be conclusively held to be true. _For c, we shall substitute the\r\nvelocity of light c in free space._ In order to avoid speaking either of\r\nspace or of vacuum, we may take this quantity as the ratio between the\r\nelectrostatic and electro-magnetic units of electricity.\r\n\r\nWe can form an idea of the invariant character of the expression for\r\nnatural laws for the group-transformation G_{_c_} in the following\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nOut of the totality of natural phenomena, we can, by successive higher\r\napproximations, deduce a coordinate system (_x_, _y_, _z_, _t_); by\r\nmeans of this coordinate system, we can represent the phenomena\r\naccording to definite laws. This system of reference is by no means\r\nuniquely determined by the phenomena. _We can change the system of\r\nreference in any possible manner corresponding to the above-mentioned\r\ngroup transformation G_{c}, but the expressions for natural laws will\r\nnot be changed thereby._\r\n\r\nFor example, corresponding to the above described figure, we can call\r\n_t′_ the time, but then necessarily the space connected with it must be\r\nexpressed by the manifoldness (_x′_ _y_ _z_). The physical laws are now\r\nexpressed by means of _x′_, _y_, _z_, _t′_,—and the expressions are just\r\nthe same as in the case of _x_, _y_, _z_, _t_. According to this, we\r\nshall have in the world, not one space, but many spaces,—quite analogous\r\nto the case that the three-dimensional space consists of an infinite\r\nnumber of planes. The three-dimensional geometry will be a chapter of\r\nfour-dimensional physics. Now you perceive, why I said in the beginning\r\nthat time and space shall reduce to mere shadows and we shall have a\r\nworld complete in itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   II\r\n\r\n\r\nNow the question may be asked,—what circumstances lead us to these\r\nchanged views about time and space, are they not in contradiction with\r\nobserved phenomena, do they finally guarantee us advantages for the\r\ndescription of natural phenomena?\r\n\r\nBefore we enter into the discussion, a very important point must be\r\nnoticed. Suppose we have individualised time and space in any manner;\r\nthen a world-line parallel to the _t_-axis will correspond to a\r\nstationary point; a world-line inclined to the _t_-axis will correspond\r\nto a point moving uniformly; and a world-curve will correspond to a\r\npoint moving in any manner. Let us now picture to our mind the\r\nworld-line passing through any world point _x_, _y_, _z_, _t_; now if we\r\nfind the world-line parallel to the radius vector OA′ of the\r\nhyperboloidal sheet, then we can introduce OA′ as a new time-axis, and\r\nthen according to the new conceptions of time and space the substance\r\nwill appear to be at rest in the world point concerned. We shall now\r\nintroduce this fundamental axiom:—\r\n\r\n_The substance existing at any world point can always be conceived to be\r\nat rest, if we establish our time and space suitably._ The axiom denotes\r\nthat in a world-point, the expression\r\n\r\n                     _c²__dt²_ - _dx²_ - _dy²_ - _dz²_\r\n\r\nshall always be positive or what is equivalent to the same thing, every\r\nvelocity V should be smaller than _c_. _c_ shall therefore be the upper\r\nlimit for all substantial velocities and herein lies a deep significance\r\nfor the quantity _c_. At the first impression, the axiom seems to be\r\nrather unsatisfactory. It is to be remembered that only a modified\r\nmechanics will occur, in which the square root of this differential\r\ncombination takes the place of time, so that cases in which the velocity\r\nis greater than _c_ will play no part, something like imaginary\r\ncoordinates in geometry.\r\n\r\nThe _impulse_ and real cause of inducement _for the assumption of the\r\ngroup-transformation G_{c}_ is the fact that the differential equation\r\nfor the propagation of light in vacant space possesses the\r\ngroup-transformation G_{_c_}. On the other hand, the idea of rigid\r\nbodies has any sense only in a system mechanics with the group\r\nG_{infinity}. Now if we have an optics with G_{_c_}, and on the other\r\nhand if there are rigid bodies, it is easy to see that a _t_-direction\r\ncan be defined by the two hyperboloidal shells common to the groups\r\nG_{∞}, and G_{_c_}, which has got the further consequence, that by means\r\nof suitable rigid instruments in the laboratory, we can perceive a\r\nchange in natural phenomena, in case of different orientations, with\r\nregard to the direction of progressive motion of the earth. But all\r\nefforts directed towards this object, and even the celebrated\r\ninterference-experiment of Michelson have given negative results. In\r\norder to supply an explanation for this result, H. A. Lorentz formed a\r\nhypothesis which practically amounts to an invariance of optics for the\r\ngroup G_{_c_}. According to Lorentz every substance shall suffer a\r\ncontraction\r\n\r\n1:(√(1 - v²/_c²_)) in length, in the direction of its motion\r\n\r\n         _l_/_l′_ = 1/√(1 - _v²_/_c²_)  _l′_ = _l_(1 - _v²_/_c²_).\r\n\r\nThis hypothesis sounds rather phantastical. For the contraction is not\r\nto be thought of as a consequence of the resistance of ether, but purely\r\nas a gift from the skies, as a sort of condition always accompanying a\r\nstate of motion.\r\n\r\nI shall show in our figure that Lorentz’s hypothesis is fully equivalent\r\nto the new conceptions about time and space. Thereby it may appear more\r\nintelligible. Let us now, for the sake of simplicity, neglect (_y_, _z_)\r\nand fix our attention on a two dimensional world, in which let upright\r\nstrips parallel to the _t_-axis represent a state of rest and another\r\nparallel strip inclined to the _t_-axis represent a state of uniform\r\nmotion for a body, which has a constant spatial extension (see fig. 1).\r\nIf OA′ is parallel to the second strip, we can take _t′_ as the _t_-axis\r\nand _x′_ as the _x_-axis, then the second body will appear to be at\r\nrest, and the first body in uniform motion. We shall now assume that the\r\nfirst body supposed to be at rest, has the length _l_, _i.e._, the cross\r\nsection PP of the first strip upon the _x_-axis = _l_^. OC, where OC is\r\nthe unit measuring rod upon the _x_-axis—and the second body also, when\r\nsupposed to be at rest, has the same length _l_, this means that, the\r\ncross section Q′Q′ of the second strip has a cross-section _l_^· OC′,\r\nwhen measured parallel to the _x′_-axis. In these two bodies, we have\r\nnow images of two Lorentz-electrons, one of which is at rest and the\r\nother moves uniformly. Now if we stick to our original coordinates, then\r\nthe extension of the second electron is given by the cross section QQ of\r\nthe strip belonging to it measured parallel to the _x_-axis. Now it is\r\nclear since Q′Q′ = _l_^· OC′, that QQ = _l_^· OD′.\r\n\r\nIf (_dc_/_dt_) = _v_, an easy calculation gives that\r\n\r\n     OD′ = OC √(1-(_v²_/_c²_)), therefore (PP/QQ) = (1/√(1-(_v²_/_c²_))\r\n\r\nThis is the sense of Lorentz’s hypothesis about the contraction of\r\nelectrons in case of motion. On the other hand, if we conceive the\r\nsecond electron to be at rest, and therefore adopt the system (_x′_,\r\n_t′_,) then the cross-section P′P′ of the strip of the electron parallel\r\nto OC′ is to be regarded as its length and we shall find the first\r\nelectron shortened with reference to the second in the same proportion,\r\nfor it is,\r\n\r\n                    P′P′/Q′Q′ = OD/OC′ = OD′/OC = QQ/PP\r\n\r\nLorentz called the combination _t′_ of (_t_ and _x_) as the _local time_\r\n(_Ortszeit_) of the uniformly moving electron, and used a physical\r\nconstruction of this idea for a better comprehension of the\r\ncontraction-hypothesis. But to perceive clearly that the time of an\r\nelectron is as good as the time of any other electron, _i.e._ _t_, _t′_\r\nare to be regarded as equivalent, has been the service of A. Einstein\r\n[Ann. d. Phys. 891, p. 1905, Jahrb. d. Radis. ... 4-4-11-1907.] There\r\nthe concept of time was shown to be completely and unambiguously\r\nestablished by natural phenomena. But the concept of space was not\r\narrived at, either by Einstein or Lorentz, probably because in the case\r\nof the above-mentioned spatial transformations, where the (_x′_, _t′_)\r\nplane coincides with the _x_-_t_ plane, the significance is possible\r\nthat the _x_-axis of space some-how remains conserved in its position.\r\n\r\nWe can approach the idea of space in a corresponding manner, though some\r\nmay regard the attempt as rather fantastical.\r\n\r\nAccording to these ideas, the word “Relativity-Postulate” which has been\r\ncoined for the demands of invariance in the group G, seems to be rather\r\ninexpressive for a true understanding of the group G_{_c_}, and for\r\nfurther progress. Because the sense of the postulate is that the\r\nfour-dimensional world is given in space and time by phenomena only, but\r\nthe projection in time and space can be handled with a certain freedom,\r\nand therefore I would rather like to give to this assertion the name\r\n“_The Postulate of the Absolute world_” [World-Postulate].\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  III\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the world-postulate a similar treatment of the four determining\r\nquantities _x_, _y_, _z_, _t_, of a world-point is possible. Thereby the\r\nforms under which the physical laws come forth, gain in intelligibility,\r\nas I shall presently show. Above all, the idea of acceleration becomes\r\nmuch more striking and clear.\r\n\r\nI shall again use the geometrical method of expression. Let us call any\r\nworld-point O as a “Space-time-null-point.” The cone\r\n\r\n                     _c²__t²_ - _x²_ - _y²_ - _z²_ = O\r\n\r\nconsists of two parts with O as apex, one part having _t_ < 0, the other\r\nhaving _t_ > 0. The first, which we may call _the fore-cone_ consists of\r\nall those points which send light towards O, the second, which we may\r\ncall _the aft-cone_, consists of all those points which receive their\r\nlight from O. The region bounded by the fore-cone may be called the\r\nfore-side of O, and the region bounded by the aft-cone may be called the\r\naft-side of O. (_Vide_ fig. 2).\r\n\r\nOn the aft-side of O we have the already considered hyperboloidal shell\r\nF = _c²__t²_ - _x²_ - _y²_ - _z²_ = 1, _t_ > 0.\r\n\r\nThe region inside the two cones will be occupied by the hyperboloid of\r\none sheet\r\n\r\n                 -F = _x²_ + _y²_ + _z²_ - _c²__t²_ = _k²_,\r\n\r\nwhere _k²_ can have all possible positive values. The hyperbolas which\r\nlie upon this figure with O as centre, are important for us. For the\r\nsake of clearness the individual branches of this hyperbola will be\r\ncalled the “_Inter-hyperbola with centre O_.” Such a hyperbolic branch,\r\nwhen thought of as a world-line, would represent a motion which for _t_\r\n= -∞ and _t_ = ∞, asymptotically approaches the velocity of light _c_.\r\n\r\nIf, by way of analogy to the idea of vectors in space, we call any\r\ndirected length in the manifoldness _x_, _y_, _z_, _t_ a vector, then we\r\nhave to distinguish between a time-vector directed from O towards the\r\nsheet ±F = 1, _t_ > 0 and a space-vector directed from O towards the\r\nsheet -F = 1. The time-axis can be parallel to any vector of the first\r\nkind. Any world-point between the _fore_ and _aft cones_ of O, may by\r\nmeans of the system of reference be regarded either as synchronous with\r\nO, as well as later or earlier than O. Every world-point on the\r\nfore-side of O is necessarily always earlier, every point on the aft\r\nside of O, later than O. The limit _c_ = ∞ corresponds to a complete\r\nfolding up of the wedge-shaped cross-section between the fore and aft\r\ncones in the manifoldness _t_ = 0. In the figure drawn, this\r\ncross-section has been intentionally drawn with a different breadth.\r\n\r\nLet us decompose a vector drawn from O towards (_x_, _y_, _z_, _t_) into\r\nits components. If the directions of the two vectors are respectively\r\nthe directions of the radius vector OR to one of the surfaces ±F = 1,\r\nand of a tangent RS at the point R of the surface, then the vectors\r\nshall be called normal to each other. Accordingly\r\n\r\n                   _c²__tt₁_ - _xx₁_ - _yy₁_ - _zz₁_ = 0,\r\n\r\nwhich is the condition that the vectors with the components (_x_, _y_,\r\n_z_, _t_) and (_x₁_ _y₁_ _z₁_ _t₁_) are normal to each other.\r\n\r\nFor the _measurement_ of vectors in different directions, the unit\r\nmeasuring rod is to be fixed in the following manner;—a space-like\r\nvector from 0 to -F = I is always to have the measure unity, and a\r\ntime-like vector from O to +F = 1, _t_ > 0 is always to have the measure\r\n1/_c_.\r\n\r\nLet us now fix our attention upon the world-line of a substantive point\r\nrunning through the world-point (_x_, _y_, _z_, _t_); then as we follow\r\nthe _progress_ of the line, the quantity\r\n\r\n            _d_τ = (1/_c_) √(_c²__dt²_ - _dx²_ - _dy²_ - _dz²_),\r\n\r\ncorresponds to the time-like vector-element (_dx_, _dy_, _dz_, _dt_).\r\n\r\nThe integral τ = ∫_d_τ, taken over the world-line from any fixed\r\ninitial point P₀ to any variable final point P, may be called the\r\n“Proper-time” of the substantial point at P₀ upon the _world-line_. We\r\nmay regard (_x_, _y_, _z_, _t_), _i.e._, the components of the vector\r\nOP, as functions of the “proper-time” τ; let ([._x_], [._y_], [._z_],\r\n[._t_]) denote the first differential-quotients, and ([.._x_],\r\n[.._y_], [.._z_], [.._t_]) the second differential quotients of (_x_,\r\n_y_, _z_, _t_) with regard to τ, then these may respectively be called\r\nthe _Velocity-vector_, and the _Acceleration-vector_ of the\r\nsubstantial point at P. Now we have\r\n\r\n    _c²_ [._t²_] - [._x²_] - [._y²_] - [._z²_] = _c²_\r\n\r\n    _c²_ [._t_][.._t_] - [._x_][.._x_] - [._y_][.._y_] - [._z_][.._z_] =\r\n       0\r\n\r\n_i.e._, the ‘_Velocity-vector_’ is the time-like vector of unit measure\r\nin the direction of the world-line at P, the ‘_Acceleration-vector_’ at\r\nP is normal to the velocity-vector at P, and is in any case, a\r\nspace-like vector.\r\n\r\nNow there is, as can be easily seen, a certain hyperbola, which has\r\nthree infinitely contiguous points in common with the world-line at P,\r\nand of which the asymptotes are the generators of a ‘fore-cone’ and an\r\n‘aft-cone.’ This hyperbola may be called the “hyperbola of curvature” at\r\nP (_vide_ fig. 3). If M be the centre of this hyperbola, then we have to\r\ndeal here with an ‘Inter-hyperbola’ with centre M. Let P = measure of\r\nthe vector MP, then we easily perceive that the acceleration-vector at P\r\nis _a vector of magnitude_ _c²_/ρ _in the direction of_ MP.\r\n\r\nIf [.._x_], [.._y_], [.._z_], [.._t_] are nil, then the hyperbola of\r\ncurvature at P reduces to the straight line touching the world-line at\r\nP, and ρ = ∞.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   IV\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to demonstrate that the assumption of the group G_{_c_} for the\r\nphysical laws does not possibly lead to any contradiction, it is\r\nunnecessary to undertake a revision of the whole of physics on the basis\r\nof the assumptions underlying this group. The revision has already been\r\nsuccessfully made in the case of “Thermodynamics and Radiation,”[30] for\r\n“Electromagnetic phenomena”,[31] and finally for “Mechanics with the\r\nmaintenance of the idea of mass.”\r\n\r\nFor this last mentioned province of physics, the question may be asked:\r\nif there is a force with the components X, Y, Z (in the direction of the\r\nspace-axes) at a world-point (_x_, _y_, _z_, _t_), where the\r\nvelocity-vector is ([._x_], [._y_], [._z_], [._t_]), then how are we to\r\nregard this force when the system of reference is changed in any\r\npossible manner? Now it is known that there are certain well-tested\r\ntheorems about the ponderomotive force in electromagnetic fields, where\r\nthe group G_{_c_} is undoubtedly permissible. These theorems lead us to\r\nthe following simple rule; _if the system of reference be changed in any\r\nway, then the supposed force is to be put as a force in the new\r\nspace-coordinates in such a manner, that the corresponding vector with\r\nthe components_\r\n\r\n    [._t_]X, [._t_]Y, [._t_]Z, [._t_]T,\r\n\r\n    _where_ T = 1/_c²_ ([._x_]/[._t_] X + [._y_]/[._t_] Y +\r\n       [._z_]/[._t_] Z) = 1/_c²_\r\n    (_the rate of\r\n    which work is done at the world-point_), _remains unaltered_.\r\n\r\nThis vector is always normal to the velocity-vector at P. Such a\r\nforce-vector, representing a force at P, may be called a _moving\r\nforce-vector at_ P.\r\n\r\nNow the world-line passing through P will be described by a substantial\r\npoint with the constant _mechanical mass m_. Let us call _m-times_ the\r\nvelocity-vector at P as the _impulse-vector_, and _m-times_ the\r\nacceleration-vector at P as the _force-vector of motion_, at P.\r\nAccording to these definitions, the following law tells us how the\r\nmotion of a point-mass takes place under any moving force-vector[32]:\r\n\r\n_The force-vector of motion is equal to the moving force-vector._\r\n\r\nThis enunciation comprises four equations for the components in the four\r\ndirections, of which the fourth can be deduced from the first three,\r\nbecause both of the above-mentioned vectors are perpendicular to the\r\nvelocity-vector. From the definition of T, we see that the fourth simply\r\nexpresses the “Energy-law.” Accordingly _c²_-_times the component of the\r\nimpulse-vector in the direction of the t-axis is_ to be defined as _the\r\nkinetic-energy_ of the point-mass. The expression for this is\r\n\r\n                 _mc²_ _dt_/_d_τ = _mc²_ /√(1 - _v²_/_c²_)\r\n\r\n_i.e._, if we deduct from this the additive constant _mc²_, we obtain\r\nthe expression ½ _mv²_ of Newtonian-mechanics up to magnitudes of _the\r\norder of_ 1/_c²_. Hence it appears that _the energy_ depends _upon the\r\nsystem of reference_. But since the _t_-axis can be laid in the\r\ndirection of any time-like axis, therefore the energy-law comprises, for\r\nany possible system of reference, the whole system of equations of\r\nmotion. This fact retains its significance even in the limiting case c =\r\n∞, for the axiomatic construction of Newtonian mechanics, as has already\r\nbeen pointed out by T. R. Schütz.[33]\r\n\r\nFrom the very beginning, we can establish the ratio between the units of\r\ntime and space in such a manner, that the velocity of light becomes\r\nunity. If we now write √-1 _t_ = _l_, in the place of _l_, then the\r\ndifferential expression\r\n\r\n                 _d_τ² = -(_dx²_ + _dy²_ + _dz²_ + _dl²_),\r\n\r\nbecomes symmetrical in (_x_, _y_, _r_, _l_); this symmetry then enters\r\ninto each law, which does not contradict the _world-postulate_. We can\r\nclothe the “essential nature of this postulate in the mystical, but\r\nmathematically significant formula\r\n\r\n                           3·10⁵ _km_ = √-1 Sec.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   V\r\n\r\n\r\nThe advantages arising from the formulation of the world-postulate are\r\nillustrated by nothing so strikingly as by the expressions which tell us\r\nabout the reactions exerted by a point-charge moving in any manner\r\naccording to the Maxwell-Lorentz theory.\r\n\r\nLet us conceive of the world-line of such an electron with the charge\r\n(_e_), and let us introduce upon it the “Proper-time” τ reckoned from\r\nany possible initial point. In order to obtain the field caused by the\r\nelectron at any world-point P₁ let us construct the fore-cone belonging\r\nto P₁ (_vide_ fig. 4). Clearly this cuts the unlimited world-line of the\r\nelectron at a single point P, because these directions are all time-like\r\nvectors. At P, let us draw the tangent to the world-line, and let us\r\ndraw from P₁ the normal to this tangent. Let _r_ be the measure of P₁Q.\r\nAccording to the definition of a fore-cone, _r_/_e_ is to be reckoned as\r\nthe measure of PQ. Now at the world-point P₁, the vector-potential of\r\nthe field excited by _e_ is represented by the vector in direction PQ,\r\nhaving the magnitude _e_/_cr_, in its three space components along the\r\n_x_-, _y_-, _z_-axes; the scalar-potential is represented by the\r\ncomponent along the _t_-axis. This is the elementary law found out by A.\r\nLienard, and E. Wiechert.[34]\r\n\r\nIf the field caused by the electron be described in the above-mentioned\r\nway, then it will appear that the division of the field into electric\r\nand magnetic forces is a relative one, and depends upon the time-axis\r\nassumed; the two forces considered together bears some analogy to the\r\nforce-screw in mechanics; the analogy is, however, imperfect.\r\n\r\nI shall now describe _the ponderomotive force which is exerted by one\r\nmoving electron upon another moving electron_. Let us suppose that the\r\nworld-line of a second point-electron passes through the world-point P₁.\r\nLet us determine P, Q, _r_ as before, construct the middle-point M of\r\nthe hyperbola of curvature at P, and finally the normal MN upon a line\r\nthrough P which is parallel to QP₁. With P as the initial point, we\r\nshall establish a system of reference in the following way: the _t_-axis\r\nwill be laid along PQ, the _x_-axis in the direction of QP₁. The\r\n_y_-axis in the direction of MN, then the _z_-axis is automatically\r\ndetermined, as it is normal to the _x_-, _y_-, _z_-axes. Let [:_x_],\r\n[:_y_], [:_z_], [:_t_] be the acceleration-vector at P, [._x_]₁, [._y_]₁\r\n[._z_]₁, [._t_]₁ be the velocity-vector at P₁. Then the force-vector\r\nexerted by the first election _e_, (moving in any possible manner) upon\r\nthe second election _e_, (likewise moving in any possible manner) at P₁\r\nis represented by\r\n\r\n                      -_e e₁_([._t₁_] - [._x₁_]/_c_)F,\r\n\r\n_For the components F_{x}, F_{y}, F_{z}, F_{t} of the vector F the\r\nfollowing three relations hold_:—\r\n\r\n    _c_F_{_t_} - F_{_x_} = 1/_r²_, F_{_y_} = [:_y_]/(_c²__r_), F_{_z_} =\r\n       0,\r\n\r\n_and fourthly this vector F is normal to the velocity-vector_ P₁, _and\r\nthrough this circumstance alone, its dependence on this last\r\nvelocity-vector arises_.\r\n\r\nIf we compare with this expression the previous formulæ[35] giving the\r\nelementary law about the ponderomotive action of moving electric charges\r\nupon each other, then we cannot but admit, that the relations which\r\noccur here reveal the inner essence of full simplicity first in four\r\ndimensions; but in three dimensions, they have very complicated\r\nprojections.\r\n\r\nIn the mechanics reformed according to the world-postulate, the\r\ndisharmonies which have disturbed the relations between Newtonian\r\nmechanics and modern electrodynamics automatically disappear. I shall\r\nnow consider the position of the Newtonian law of attraction to this\r\npostulate. I will assume that two point-masses _m_ and _m₁_ describe\r\ntheir world-lines; a moving force-vector is exercised by _m_ upon _m₁_,\r\nand the expression is just the same as in the case of the electron, only\r\nwe have to write +_mm₁_ instead -_ee₁_. We shall consider only the\r\nspecial case in which the acceleration-vector of _m_ is always zero:\r\nthen _t_ may be introduced in such a manner that _m_ may be regarded as\r\nfixed, the motion of _m_ is now subjected to the moving-force vector of\r\n_m_ alone. If we now modify this given vector by writing\r\n-([^.]1/√(1-(_v_²/_c²_)) instead of [._t_] ([._t_] = 1 up to magnitudes\r\nof the order (1[^.]/_c²_)), then it appears that Kepler’s laws hold good\r\nfor the position (_x₁_, _y₁_, _z₁_), of _m₁_ at any time, only in place\r\nof the time _t₁_, we have to write the proper time τ₁ of _m₁_. On the\r\nbasis of this simple remark, it can be seen that the proposed law of\r\nattraction in combination with new mechanics is not less suited for the\r\nexplanation of astronomical phenomena than the Newtonian law of\r\nattraction in combination with Newtonian mechanics.\r\n\r\nAlso the fundamental equations for electro-magnetic processes in moving\r\nbodies are in accordance with the world-postulate. I shall also show on\r\na later occasion that the deduction of these equations, as taught by\r\nLorentz, are by no means to be given up.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the world-postulate holds without exception is, I believe,\r\nthe true essence of an electromagnetic picture of the world; the idea\r\nfirst occurred to Lorentz, its essence was first picked out by Einstein,\r\nand is now gradually fully manifest. In course of time, the mathematical\r\nconsequences will be gradually deduced, and enough suggestions will be\r\nforthcoming for the experimental verification of the postulate; in this\r\nway even those, who find it uncongenial, or even painful to give up the\r\nold, time-honoured concepts, will be reconciled to the new ideas of time\r\nand space,—in the prospect that they will lead to pre-established\r\nharmony between pure mathematics and physics.\r\n\r\nFootnote 30:\r\n\r\n  Planck, Zur Dynamik bewegter systeme, Ann. d. physik, Bd. 26, 1908, p.\r\n  1.\r\n\r\nFootnote 31:\r\n\r\n  H.

Einstein.\r\n                   From Annalen der Physik 4.49.1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe theory which is sketched in the following pages forms the most\r\nwide-going generalization conceivable of what is at present known as\r\n“the theory of Relativity;” this latter theory I differentiate from the\r\nformer “Special Relativity theory,” and suppose it to be known. The\r\ngeneralization of the Relativity theory has been made much easier\r\nthrough the form given to the special Relativity theory by Minkowski,\r\nwhich mathematician was the first to recognize clearly the formal\r\nequivalence of the space like and time-like co-ordinates, and who made\r\nuse of it in the building up of the theory. The mathematical apparatus\r\nuseful for the general relativity theory, lay already complete in the\r\n“Absolute Differential Calculus,” which were based on the researches of\r\nGauss, Riemann and Christoffel on the non-Euclidean manifold, and which\r\nhave been shaped into a system by Ricci and Levi-civita, and already\r\napplied to the problems of theoretical physics. I have in part B of this\r\ncommunication developed in the simplest and clearest manner, all the\r\nsupposed mathematical auxiliaries, not known to Physicists, which will\r\nbe useful for our purpose, so that, a study of the mathematical\r\nliterature is not necessary for an understanding of this paper. Finally\r\nin this place I thank my friend Grossmann, by whose help I was not only\r\nspared the study of the mathematical literature pertinent to this\r\nsubject, but who also aided me in the researches on the field equations\r\nof gravitation.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   A\r\n      Principal considerations about the Postulate of Relativity.\r\n\r\n\r\n             § 1. Remarks on the Special Relativity Theory.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe special relativity theory rests on the following postulate which\r\nalso holds valid for the Galileo-Newtonian mechanics.\r\n\r\nIf a co-ordinate system K be so chosen that when referred to it, the\r\nphysical laws hold in their simplest forms these laws would be also\r\nvalid when referred to another system of co-ordinates K′ which is\r\nsubjected to an uniform translational motion relative to K. We call this\r\npostulate “The Special Relativity Principle.” By the word special, it is\r\nsignified that the principle is limited to the case, when K′ has\r\n_uniform translatory_ motion with reference to K, but the equivalence of\r\nK and K′ does not extend to the case of non-uniform motion of K′\r\nrelative to K.\r\n\r\nThe Special Relativity Theory does not differ from the classical\r\nmechanics through the assumption of this postulate, but only through the\r\npostulate of the constancy of light-velocity in vacuum which, when\r\ncombined with the special relativity postulate, gives in a well-known\r\nway, the relativity of synchronism as well as the Lorenz-transformation,\r\nwith all the relations between moving rigid bodies and clocks.\r\n\r\nThe modification which the theory of space and time has undergone\r\nthrough the special relativity theory, is indeed a profound one, but a\r\nweightier point remains untouched. According to the special relativity\r\ntheory, the theorems of geometry are to be looked upon as the laws about\r\nany possible relative positions of solid bodies at rest, and more\r\ngenerally the theorems of kinematics, as theorems which describe the\r\nrelation between measurable bodies and clocks. Consider two material\r\npoints of a solid body at rest; then according to these conceptions\r\nthere corresponds to these points a wholly definite extent of length,\r\nindependent of kind, position, orientation and time of the body.\r\n\r\nSimilarly let us consider two positions of the pointers of a clock which\r\nis at rest with reference to a co-ordinate system; then to these\r\npositions, there always corresponds, a time-interval of a definite\r\nlength, independent of time and place. It would be soon shown that the\r\ngeneral relativity theory can not hold fast to this simple physical\r\nsignificance of space and time.\r\n\r\n\r\n       § 2. About the reasons which explain the extension of the\r\n                         relativity-postulate.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the classical mechanics (no less than) to the special relativity\r\ntheory, is attached an episteomological defect, which was perhaps first\r\ncleanly pointed out by E. Mach. We shall illustrate it by the following\r\nexample; Let two fluid bodies of equal kind and magnitude swim freely in\r\nspace at such a great distance from one another (and from all other\r\nmasses) that only that sort of gravitational forces are to be taken into\r\naccount which the parts of any of these bodies exert upon each other.\r\nThe distance of the bodies from one another is invariable. The relative\r\nmotion of the different parts of each body is not to occur. But each\r\nmass is seen to rotate by an observer at rest relative to the other mass\r\nround the connecting line of the masses with a constant angular velocity\r\n(definite relative motion for both the masses). Now let us think that\r\nthe surfaces of both the bodies (S₁ and S₂) are measured with the help\r\nof measuring rods (relatively at rest); it is then found that the\r\nsurface of S₁ is a sphere and the surface of the other is an ellipsoid\r\nof rotation. We now ask, why is this difference between the two bodies?\r\nAn answer to this question can only then be regarded as satisfactory\r\nfrom the episteomological standpoint when the thing adduced as the cause\r\nis an observable fact of experience. The law of causality has the sense\r\nof a definite statement about the world of experience only when\r\nobservable facts alone appear as causes and effects.\r\n\r\nThe Newtonian mechanics does not give to this question any satisfactory\r\nanswer. For example, it says:—The laws of mechanics hold true for a\r\nspace R₁ relative to which the body S₁ is at rest, not however for a\r\nspace relative to which S₂ is at rest.\r\n\r\nThe Galiliean space, which is here introduced is however only a purely\r\nimaginary cause, not an observable thing. It is thus clear that the\r\nNewtonian mechanics does not, in the case treated here, actually fulfil\r\nthe requirements of causality, but produces on the mind a fictitious\r\ncomplacency, in that it makes responsible a _wholly imaginary cause_ R₁\r\nfor the different behaviours of the bodies S₁ and S₂ which are actually\r\nobservable.\r\n\r\nA satisfactory explanation to the question put forward above can only be\r\nthus given:—that the physical system composed of S₁ and S₂ shows for\r\nitself alone no conceivable cause to which the different behaviour of S₁\r\nand S₂ can be attributed. The cause must thus lie outside the system. We\r\nare therefore led to the conception that the general laws of motion\r\nwhich determine specially the forms of S₁ and S₂ must be of such a kind,\r\nthat the mechanical behaviour of S₁ and S₂ must be essentially\r\nconditioned by the distant masses, which we had not brought into the\r\nsystem considered. These distant masses, (and their relative motion as\r\nregards the bodies under consideration) are then to be looked upon as\r\nthe seat of the principal observable causes for the different behaviours\r\nof the bodies under consideration. They take the place of the imaginary\r\ncause R₁. Among all the conceivable spaces R₁ and R₂ moving in any\r\nmanner relative to one another, there is a priori, no one set which can\r\nbe regarded as affording greater advantages, against which the objection\r\nwhich was already raised from the standpoint of the theory of knowledge\r\ncannot be again revived. The laws of physics must be so constituted that\r\nthey should remain valid for any system of co-ordinates moving in any\r\nmanner. We thus arrive at an extension of the relativity postulate.\r\n\r\nBesides this momentous episteomological argument, there is also a\r\nwell-known physical fact which speaks in favour of an extension of the\r\nrelativity theory. Let there be a Galiliean co-ordinate system K\r\nrelative to which (at least in the four-dimensional region considered) a\r\nmass at a sufficient distance from other masses move uniformly in a\r\nline. Let K′ be a second co-ordinate system which has a uniformly\r\naccelerated motion relative to K. Relative to K′ any mass at a\r\nsufficiently great distance experiences an accelerated motion such that\r\nits acceleration and the direction of acceleration is independent of its\r\nmaterial composition and its physical conditions.\r\n\r\nCan any observer, at rest relative to K′, then conclude that he is in an\r\nactually accelerated reference-system? This is to be answered in the\r\nnegative; the above-named behaviour of the freely moving masses relative\r\nto K′ can be explained in as good a manner in the following way. The\r\nreference-system K′ has no acceleration. In the space-time region\r\nconsidered there is a gravitation-field which generates the accelerated\r\nmotion relative to K′.\r\n\r\nThis conception is feasible, because to us the experience of the\r\nexistence of a field of force (namely the gravitation field) has shown\r\nthat it possesses the remarkable property of imparting the same\r\nacceleration to all bodies. The mechanical behaviour of the bodies\r\nrelative to K′ is the same as experience would expect of them with\r\nreference to systems which we assume from habit as stationary; thus it\r\nexplains why from the physical stand-point it can be assumed that the\r\nsystems K and K′ can both with the same legitimacy be taken as at rest,\r\nthat is, they will be equivalent as systems of reference for a\r\ndescription of physical phenomena.\r\n\r\nFrom these discussions we see, that the working out of the general\r\nrelativity theory must, at the same time, lead to a theory of\r\ngravitation; for we can “create” a gravitational field by a simple\r\nvariation of the co-ordinate system. Also we see immediately that the\r\nprinciple of the constancy of light-velocity must be modified, for we\r\nrecognise easily that the path of a ray of light with reference to K′\r\nmust be, in general, curved, when light travels with a definite and\r\nconstant velocity in a straight line with reference to K.\r\n\r\n\r\n § 3. The time-space continuum. Requirements of the general Co-variance\r\n      for the equations expressing the laws of Nature in general.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the classical mechanics as well as in the special relativity theory,\r\nthe co-ordinates of time and space have an immediate physical\r\nsignificance; when we say that any arbitrary point has _x₁_ as its X₁\r\nco-ordinate, it signifies that the projection of the point-event on the\r\nX₁-axis _ascertained_ by means of a solid rod according to the rules of\r\nEuclidean Geometry is reached when a definite measuring rod, the unit\r\nrod, can be carried _x₁_ times from the origin of co-ordinates along the\r\nX₁ axis. A point having _x₄_ = _t₁_ as the X₄ co-ordinate signifies that\r\na unit clock which is adjusted to be at rest relative to the system of\r\nco-ordinates, and coinciding in its spatial position with the\r\npoint-event and set according to some definite standard has gone over\r\n_x₄_ = _t_ periods before the occurrence of the point-event.\r\n\r\nThis conception of time and space is continually present in the mind of\r\nthe physicist, though often in an unconscious way, as is clearly\r\nrecognised from the role which this conception has played in physical\r\nmeasurements. This conception must also appear to the reader to be lying\r\nat the basis of the second consideration of the last paragraph and\r\nimparting a sense to these conceptions. But we wish to show that we are\r\nto abandon it and in general to replace it by more general conceptions\r\nin order to be able to work out thoroughly the postulate of general\r\nrelativity,—the case of special relativity appearing as a limiting case\r\nwhen there is no gravitation.\r\n\r\nWe introduce in a space, which is free from Gravitation-field, a\r\nGaliliean Co-ordinate System K (_x_, _y_, _z_, _t_) and also, another\r\nsystem K′ (_x′_ _y′_ _z′_ _t′_) rotating uniformly relative to K. The\r\norigin of both the systems as well as their _z_-axes might continue to\r\ncoincide. We will show that for a space-time measurement in the system\r\nK′, the above established rules for the physical significance of time\r\nand space can not be maintained. On grounds of symmetry it is clear that\r\na circle round the origin in the XY plane of K, can also be looked upon\r\nas a circle in the plane (X′, Y′) of K′. Let us now think of measuring\r\nthe circumference and the diameter of these circles, with a unit\r\nmeasuring rod (infinitely small compared with the radius) and take the\r\nquotient of both the results of measurement. If this experiment be\r\ncarried out with a measuring rod at rest relatively to the Galiliean\r\nsystem K we would get π, as the quotient. The result of measurement with\r\na rod relatively at rest as regards K′ would be a number which is\r\ngreater than π. This can be seen easily when we regard the whole\r\nmeasurement-process from the system K and remember that the rod placed\r\non the periphery suffers a Lorenz-contraction, not however when the rod\r\nis placed along the radius. Euclidean Geometry therefore does not hold\r\nfor the system K′; the above fixed conceptions of co-ordinates which\r\nassume the validity of Euclidean Geometry fail with regard to the system\r\nK′. We cannot similarly introduce in K′ a time corresponding to physical\r\nrequirements, which will be shown by all similarly prepared clocks at\r\nrest relative to the system K′. In order to see this we suppose that two\r\nsimilarly made clocks are arranged one at the centre and one at the\r\nperiphery of the circle, and considered from the stationary system K.\r\nAccording to the well-known results of the special relativity theory it\r\nfollows—(as viewed from K)—that the clock placed at the periphery will\r\ngo slower than the second one which is at rest. The observer at the\r\ncommon origin of co-ordinates who is able to see the clock at the\r\nperiphery by means of light will see the clock at the periphery going\r\nslower than the clock beside him. Since he cannot allow the velocity of\r\nlight to depend explicitly upon the time in the way under consideration\r\nhe will interpret his observation by saying that the clock on the\r\nperiphery actually goes slower than the clock at the origin. He cannot\r\ntherefore do otherwise than define time in such a way that the rate of\r\ngoing of a clock depends on its position.\r\n\r\nWe therefore arrive at this result. In the general relativity theory\r\ntime and space magnitudes cannot be so defined that the difference in\r\nspatial co-ordinates can be immediately measured by the unit-measuring\r\nrod, and time-like co-ordinate difference with the aid of a normal\r\nclock.\r\n\r\nThe means hitherto at our disposal, for placing our co-ordinate system\r\nin the time-space continuum, in a definite way, therefore completely\r\nfail and it appears that there is no other way which will enable us to\r\nfit the co-ordinate system to the four-dimensional world in such a way,\r\nthat by it we can expect to get a specially simple formulation of the\r\nlaws of Nature. So that nothing remains for us but to regard all\r\nconceivable co-ordinate systems as equally suitable for the description\r\nof natural phenomena. This amounts to the following law:—\r\n\r\n_That in general, Laws of Nature are expressed by means of equations\r\nwhich are valid for all co-ordinate systems, that is, which are\r\ncovariant for all possible transformations._ It is clear that a physics\r\nwhich satisfies this postulate will be unobjectionable from the\r\nstandpoint of the general relativity postulate. Because among all\r\nsubstitutions there are, in every case, contained those, which\r\ncorrespond to all relative motions of the co-ordinate system (in three\r\ndimensions). This condition of general covariance which takes away the\r\nlast remnants of physical objectivity from space and time, is a natural\r\nrequirement, as seen from the following considerations. All our\r\n_well-substantiated_ space-time propositions amount to the determination\r\nof space-time coincidences. If, for example, the event consisted in the\r\nmotion of material points, then, for this last case, nothing else are\r\nreally observable except the encounters between two or more of these\r\nmaterial points. The results of our measurements are nothing else than\r\nwell-proved theorems about such coincidences of material points, of our\r\nmeasuring rods with other material points, coincidences between the\r\nhands of a clock, dial-marks and point-events occurring at the same\r\nposition and at the same time.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of a system of co-ordinates serves no other purpose\r\nthan an easy description of totality of such coincidences. We fit to the\r\nworld our space-time variables (_x₁_ _x₂_ _x₃_ _x₄_) such that to any\r\nand every point-event corresponds a system of values of (_x₁_ _x₂_ _x₃_\r\n_x₄_). Two coincident point-events correspond to the same value of the\r\nvariables (_x₁_ _x₂_ _x₃_ _x₄_); _i.e._, the coincidence is\r\ncharacterised by the equality of the co-ordinates. If we now introduce\r\nany four functions (_x′₁_ _x′₂_ _x′₃_ _x′₄_) as co-ordinates, so that\r\nthere is an unique correspondence between them, the equality of all the\r\nfour co-ordinates in the new system will still be the expression of the\r\nspace-time coincidence of two material points. As the purpose of all\r\nphysical laws is to allow us to remember such coincidences, there is a\r\npriori no reason present, to prefer a certain co-ordinate system to\r\nanother; _i.e._, we get the condition of general covariance.\r\n\r\n\r\n      § 4. Relation of four co-ordinates to spatial and time-like\r\n                             measurements.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Analytical expression for the Gravitation-field._\r\n\r\n\r\nI am not trying in this communication to deduce the general\r\nRelativity-theory as the simplest logical system possible, with a\r\nminimum of axioms. But it is my chief aim to develop the theory in such\r\na manner that the reader perceives the psychological naturalness of the\r\nway proposed, and the fundamental assumptions appear to be most\r\nreasonable according to the light of experience. In this sense, we shall\r\nnow introduce the following supposition; that for an infinitely small\r\nfour-dimensional region, the relativity theory is valid in the special\r\nsense when the axes are suitably chosen.\r\n\r\nThe nature of acceleration of an infinitely small (positional)\r\nco-ordinate system is hereby to be so chosen, that the gravitational\r\nfield does not appear; this is possible for an infinitely small region.\r\nX₁, X₂, X₃ are the spatial co-ordinates; X₄ is the corresponding\r\ntime-co-ordinate measured by some suitable measuring clock. These\r\nco-ordinates have, with a given orientation of the system, an immediate\r\nphysical significance in the sense of the special relativity theory\r\n(when we take a rigid rod as our unit of measure). The expression\r\n\r\n              (1) _ds²_ = - _d_X₁² - _d_X₂² - _d_X₃² + _d_X₄²\r\n\r\nhad then, according to the special relativity theory, a value which may\r\nbe obtained by space-time measurement, and which is independent of the\r\norientation of the local co-ordinate system. Let us take _ds_ as the\r\nmagnitude of the line-element belonging to two infinitely near points in\r\nthe four-dimensional region. If _ds²_ belonging to the element (_d_X₁,\r\n_d_X₂, _d_X₃, _d_X₄) be positive we call it with Minkowski, time-like,\r\nand in the contrary case space-like.\r\n\r\nTo the line-element considered, _i.e._, to both the infinitely near\r\npoint-events belong also definite differentials _dx₁_, _dx₂_, _dx₃_,\r\n_dx₄_, of the four-dimensional co-ordinates of any chosen system of\r\nreference. If there be also a local system of the above kind given for\r\nthe case under consideration, _d_X’s would then be represented by\r\ndefinite linear homogeneous expressions of the form\r\n\r\n                    (2) _d_X_{ν} = σ_{σ}_a__{νσ}_dx__{σ}\r\n\r\nIf we substitute the expression in (1) we get\r\n\r\n                 (3) _ds²_ = σ_{στ}_g__{στ}_dx__{σ}_dx__{τ}\r\n\r\nwhere _g__{στ} will be functions of _x__{σ}, but will no longer depend\r\nupon the orientation and motion of the ‘local’ co-ordinates; for _ds²_\r\nis a definite magnitude belonging to two point-events infinitely near in\r\nspace and time and can be got by measurements with rods and clocks. The\r\n_g__{τσ}’s are here to be so chosen, that _g__{τσ} = _g__{στ}; the\r\nsummation is to be extended over all values of σ and τ, so that the sum\r\nis to be extended, over 4 × 4 terms, of which 12 are equal in pairs.\r\n\r\nFrom the method adopted here, the case of the usual relativity theory\r\ncomes out when owing to the special behaviour of _g__{στ} in a _finite_\r\nregion it is possible to choose the system of co-ordinates in such a way\r\nthat _g__{στ} assumes constant values—\r\n\r\n                                  { -1, 0, 0, 0\r\n                            (4)   {  0 -1  0  0\r\n                                  {  0  0 -1  0\r\n                                  {  0  0  0 +1\r\n\r\nWe would afterwards see that the choice of such a system of co-ordinates\r\nfor a finite region is in general not possible.\r\n\r\nFrom the considerations in § 2 and § 3 it is clear, that from the\r\nphysical stand-point the quantities _g__{στ} are to be looked upon as\r\nmagnitudes which describe the gravitation-field with reference to the\r\nchosen system of axes. We assume firstly, that in a certain\r\nfour-dimensional region considered, the special relativity theory is\r\ntrue for some particular choice of co-ordinates. The _g__{στ}’s then\r\nhave the values given in (4). A free material point moves with reference\r\nto such a system uniformly in a straight-line. If we now introduce, by\r\nany substitution, the space-time co-ordinates _x₁_..._x₄_ then in the\r\nnew system _g__{μν}’s are no longer constants, but functions of space\r\nand time. At the same time, the motion of a free point-mass in the new\r\nco-ordinates, will appear as curvilinear, and not uniform, in which the\r\nlaw of motion, will be _independent of the nature of the moving\r\nmass-points_. We can thus signify this motion as one under the influence\r\nof a gravitation field. We see that the appearance of a\r\ngravitation-field is connected with space-time variability of\r\n_g__{στ}’s. In the general case, we can not by any suitable choice of\r\naxes, make special relativity theory valid throughout any finite region.\r\nWe thus deduce the conception that _g__{στ}’s describe the gravitational\r\nfield. According to the general relativity theory, gravitation thus\r\nplays an exceptional rôle as distinguished from the others, specially\r\nthe electromagnetic forces, in as much as the 10 functions _g__{στ}\r\nrepresenting gravitation, define immediately the metrical properties of\r\nthe four-dimensional region.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   B\r\n    Mathematical Auxiliaries for Establishing the General Covariant\r\n                               Equations.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have seen before that the general relativity-postulate leads to the\r\ncondition that the system of equations for Physics, must be co-variants\r\nfor any possible substitution of co-ordinates _x₁_, ... _x₄_; we have\r\nnow to see how such general co-variant equations can be obtained. We\r\nshall now turn our attention to these purely mathematical propositions.\r\nIt will be shown that in the solution, the invariant _ds_, given in\r\nequation (3) plays a fundamental rôle, which we, following Gauss’s\r\nTheory of Surfaces, style as the line-element.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental idea of the general co-variant theory is this:—With\r\nreference to any co-ordinate system, let certain things (tensors) be\r\ndefined by a number of functions of co-ordinates which are called the\r\ncomponents of the tensor. There are now certain rules according to which\r\nthe components can be calculated in a new system of co-ordinates, when\r\nthese are known for the original system, and when the transformation\r\nconnecting the two systems is known. The things herefrom designated as\r\n“Tensors” have further the property that the transformation equation of\r\ntheir components are linear and homogeneous; so that all the components\r\nin the new system vanish if they are all zero in the original system.\r\nThus a law of Nature can be formulated by putting all the components of\r\na tensor equal to zero so that it is a general co-variant equation; thus\r\nwhile we seek the laws of formation of the tensors, we also reach the\r\nmeans of establishing general co-variant laws.\r\n\r\n\r\n             5. Contra-variant and co-variant Four-vector.\r\n\r\n\r\nContra-variant Four-vector. The line-element is defined by the four\r\ncomponents _dx__{ν}, whose transformation law is expressed by the\r\nequation\r\n\r\n(5) $$ dx'_{\\sigma} = \\sum_{\\nu} \\frac{\\partial x'_{\\sigma}}{\\partial\r\nx_{\\nu}} dx_{\\nu} $$\r\n\r\nThe _dx′__{σ}’_s_ are expressed as linear and homogeneous function of\r\n_dx__{ν}’_s_; we can look upon the differentials of the co-ordinates as\r\nthe components of a tensor, which we designate specially as a\r\ncontravariant Four-vector. Everything which is defined by Four\r\nquantities A^{σ}, with reference to a co-ordinate system, and transforms\r\naccording to the same law,\r\n\r\n(5a)\r\n\r\n$$ A^{\\sigma} = \\sum_{\\nu} \\frac{\\partial x'_{\\sigma}}{\\partial x_{\\nu}}\r\nA^{\\nu} $$\r\n\r\nwe may call a contra-variant Four-vector. From (5. a), it follows at\r\nonce that the sums (A^{σ} ± B^{σ}) are also components of a four-vector,\r\nwhen A^{σ} and B^{σ} are so; corresponding relations hold also for all\r\nsystems afterwards introduced as “tensors” (Rule of addition and\r\nsubtraction of Tensors).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Co-variant Four-vector._\r\n\r\n\r\nWe call four quantities A_{ν} as the components of a covariant\r\nfour-vector, when for any choice of the contra-variant four vector B^{ν}\r\n(6) ∑_{ν} A_{ν} B^{ν} = _Invariant_. From this definition follows the\r\nlaw of transformation of the co-variant four-vectors. If we substitute\r\nin the right hand side of the equation\r\n\r\n                  ∑_{σ} A′_{σ} B^{σ′} = ∑_{ν} A_{ν} B^{ν}.\r\n\r\nthe expressions\r\n\r\n$$ \\sum_{\\sigma} \\frac{\\partial x_{\\nu}}{\\partial x_{\\sigma'}}\r\nB^{\\sigma'} $$\r\n\r\nfor B^{ν} following from the inversion of the equation (5a) we get\r\n\r\n$$ \\sum_{\\sigma} B^{\\sigma'} \\sum_{\\nu} \\frac{\\partial x_{\\nu}}{\\partial\r\nx_{\\sigma'}} A_{\\nu} = \\sum_{\\sigma} B^{\\sigma'} A'_{\\sigma} $$\r\n\r\nAs in the above equation B^{σ′} are independent of one another and\r\nperfectly arbitrary, it follows that the transformation law is:—\r\n\r\n$$ A'_{\\sigma} = \\sum \\frac{\\partial x_{\\nu}}{\\partial x_{\\sigma'}}\r\nA_{\\nu} $$\r\n\r\n_Remarks on the simplification of the mode of writing the expressions._\r\nA glance at the equations of this paragraph will show that the indices\r\nwhich appear twice within the sign of summation [for example ν in (5)]\r\nare those over which the summation is to be made and that only over the\r\nindices which appear twice. It is therefore possible, without loss of\r\nclearness, to leave off the summation sign; so that we introduce the\r\nrule: wherever the index in any term of an expression appears twice, it\r\nis to be summed over all of them except when it is not expressedly said\r\nto the contrary.\r\n\r\nThe difference between the co-variant and the contra-variant four-vector\r\nlies in the transformation laws [(7) and (5)]. Both the quantities are\r\ntensors according to the above general remarks; in it lies its\r\nsignificance. In accordance with Ricci and Levi-civita, the\r\ncontravariants and co-variants are designated by the over and under\r\nindices.\r\n\r\n\r\n              § 6. Tensors of the second and higher ranks.\r\n\r\n\r\nContravariant tensor:—If we now calculate all the 16 products A^{μν} of\r\nthe components A^{μ} B^{ν}, of two contravariant four-vectors\r\n\r\n                          (8) A^{μν} = A^{μ}B^{ν}\r\n\r\nA^{μν}, will according to (8) and (5 a) satisfy the following\r\ntransformation law.\r\n\r\n(9)\r\n\r\n$$ A^{\\sigma \\tau'} = \\frac{\\partial x'_{\\sigma}}{\\partial x_{\\mu}}\r\n\\frac{\\partial x'_{\\tau}}{\\partial x_{\\nu}} A^{\\mu \\nu} $$\r\n\r\nWe call a thing which, with reference to any reference system is defined\r\nby 16 quantities and fulfils the transformation relation (9), a\r\ncontravariant tensor of the second rank. Not every such tensor can be\r\nbuilt from two four-vectors, (according to 8). But it is easy to show\r\nthat any 16 quantities A^{μν}, can be represented as the sum of\r\nA^{μ}B^{ν} of properly chosen four pairs of four-vectors. From it, we\r\ncan prove in the simplest way all laws which hold true for the tensor of\r\nthe second rank defined through (9), by proving it only for the special\r\ntensor of the type (8).\r\n\r\n_Contravariant Tensor of any rank_:—It is clear that corresponding to\r\n(8) and (9), we can define contravariant tensors of the 3rd and higher\r\nranks, with 4³, etc. components. Thus it is clear from (8) and (9) that\r\nin this sense, we can look upon contravariant four-vectors, as\r\ncontravariant tensors of the first rank.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Co-variant tensor._\r\n\r\n\r\nIf on the other hand, we take the 16 products A_{μν} of the components\r\nof two co-variant four-vectors A_{μ} and B_{ν},\r\n\r\n                         (10) A_{μν} = A_{μ} B_{ν}.\r\n\r\nfor them holds the transformation law\r\n\r\n(11)\r\n\r\n$$ A^{\\sigma \\tau'} = \\frac{\\partial x'_{\\mu}}{\\partial x_{\\sigma'}}\r\n\\frac{\\partial x'_{\\nu}}{\\partial x_{\\tau'}} A^{\\mu \\nu} $$\r\n\r\nBy means of these transformation laws, the co-variant tensor of the\r\nsecond rank is defined. All re-marks which we have already made\r\nconcerning the contravariant tensors, hold also for co-variant tensors.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Remark_:—\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is convenient to treat the scalar Invariant either as a contravariant\r\nor a co-variant tensor of zero rank.\r\n\r\n_Mixed tensor._ We can also define a tensor of the second rank of the\r\ntype\r\n\r\n                        (12) A_{μ}^{ν} = A_{μ}B^{ν}\r\n\r\nwhich is co-variant with reference to μ and contravariant with reference\r\nto ν. Its transformation law is\r\n\r\n(13)\r\n\r\n$$ A^{\\tau'}_{\\sigma} = \\frac{\\partial x_{\\tau'}}{\\partial x_{\\beta}}\r\n\\frac{\\partial \\alpha}{\\partial x_{\\sigma'}} A^{\\beta}_{\\alpha} $$\r\n\r\nNaturally there are mixed tensors with any number of co-variant indices,\r\nand with any number of contra-variant indices. The co-variant and\r\ncontra-variant tensors can be looked upon as special cases of mixed\r\ntensors.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Symmetrical tensors_:—\r\n\r\n\r\nA contravariant or a co-variant tensor of the second or higher rank is\r\ncalled symmetrical when any two components obtained by the mutual\r\ninterchange of two indices are equal. The tensor A^{μν} or A_{μν} is\r\nsymmetrical, when we have for any combination of indices\r\n\r\n                            (14) A^{μν} = A^{νμ}\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n                           (14a) A_{μν} = A_{νμ}.\r\n\r\nIt must be proved that a symmetry so defined is a property independent\r\nof the system of reference. It follows in fact from (9) remembering (14)\r\n\r\n$$ A^{\\sigma \\tau'} = \\frac{\\partial x_{\\sigma'}}{\\partial x_{\\mu}}\r\n\\frac{\\partial x'_{\\tau}}{\\partial x_{\\nu}} A^{\\mu \\nu} = \\frac{\\partial\r\nx_{\\sigma'}}{\\partial x_{\\mu}} \\frac{\\partial x_{\\tau'}}{\\partial\r\nx_{\\nu}} A^{\\nu \\mu} = A^{\\tau \\sigma'} $$\r\n\r\n\r\n_Antisymmetrical tensor._\r\n\r\n\r\nA contravariant or co-variant tensor of the 2nd, 3rd or 4th rank is\r\ncalled _antisymmetrical_ when the two components got by mutually\r\ninterchanging any two indices are equal and opposite. The tensor or\r\nA^{μν} or A_{μν} is thus antisymmetrical when we have\r\n\r\n                           (15) A^{μν} = -A^{νμ}\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n                          (15a) A_{μν} = -A_{νμ}.\r\n\r\nOf the 16 components A^{μν}, the four components A^{μμ} vanish, the rest\r\nare equal and opposite in pairs; so that there are only 6 numerically\r\ndifferent components present (Six-vector).\r\n\r\nThus we also see that the antisymmetrical tensor A^{μνσ} (3rd rank) has\r\nonly 4 components numerically different, and the antisymmetrical tensor\r\nA^{μνστ} only one. Symmetrical tensors of ranks higher than the fourth,\r\ndo not exist in a continuum of 4 dimensions.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    § 7. Multiplication of Tensors.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Outer multiplication of Tensors_:—We get from the components of a\r\ntensor of rank _z_, and another of a rank _z′_, the components of a\r\ntensor of rank (_z_ + _z′_) for which we multiply all the components of\r\nthe first with all the components of the second in pairs. For example,\r\nwe obtain the tensor Τ from the tensors A and B of different kinds:—\r\n\r\n                        Τ_{μνσ} = A_{μν}B_{σ},\r\n\r\n                        Τ^{αβγδ} = A^{αβ}B^{γδ},\r\n\r\n                        Τ_{αβ}^{γδ} = A_{αβ}B^{γδ}.\r\n\r\nThe proof of the tensor character of Τ, follows immediately from the\r\nexpressions (8), (10) or (12), or the transformation equations (9),\r\n(11), (13); equations (8), (10) and (12) are themselves examples of the\r\nouter multiplication of tensors of the first rank.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Reduction in rank of a mixed Tensor._\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom every mixed tensor we can get a tensor which is two ranks lower,\r\nwhen we put an index of co-variant character equal to an index of the\r\ncontravariant character and sum according to these indices (Reduction).\r\nWe get for example, out of the mixed tensor of the fourth rank\r\nA_{αβ}^{γδ}, the mixed tensor of the second rank\r\n\r\n               A_{β}^{δ} = A_{αβ}^{αδ} = (∑_{α} A_{αβ}^{αδ})\r\n\r\nand from it again by “reduction” the tensor of the zero rank\r\n\r\n                        A = A_{β}^{β} = A_{αβ}^{αβ}.\r\n\r\nThe proof that the result of reduction retains a truly tensorial\r\ncharacter, follows either from the representation of tensor according to\r\nthe generalisation of (12) in combination with (6) or out of the\r\ngeneralisation of (13).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Inner and mixed multiplication of Tensors._\r\n\r\n\r\nThis consists in the combination of outer multiplication with reduction.\r\nExamples:—From the co-variant tensor of the second rank A_{μν} and the\r\ncontravariant tensor of the first rank B^{σ} we get by outer\r\nmultiplication the mixed tensor\r\n\r\n                        D^{σ}_{μν} = A_{μν} B^{σ} .\r\n\r\nThrough reduction according to indices ν and σ (_i.e._, putting ν = σ),\r\nthe co-variant four vector\r\n\r\n              D_{μ} = D^{ν}_{μν} = A_{μν} B^{ν} is generated.\r\n\r\nThese we denote as the inner product of the tensor A_{μν} and B^{σ}.\r\nSimilarly we get from the tensors A_{μν} and B^{στ} through outer\r\nmultiplication and two-fold reduction the inner product A_{μν} B^{μν}.\r\nThrough outer multiplication and one-fold reduction we get out of A_{μν}\r\nand B^{στ}, the mixed tensor of the second rank D^{τ}_{μ} = A_{μν}\r\nB^{τν}. We can fitly call this operation a mixed one; for it is outer\r\nwith reference to the indices μ and τ and inner with respect to the\r\nindices ν and σ.\r\n\r\nWe now prove a law, which will be often applicable for proving the\r\ntensor-character of certain quantities. According to the above\r\nrepresentation, A_{μν} B^{μν} is a scalar, when A_{μν} and B^{στ} are\r\ntensors. We also remark that when A_{μν} B^{μν} is an invariant for\r\nevery choice of the tensor B^{μν}, then A_{μν} has a tensorial\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nProof:—According to the above assumption, for any substitution we have\r\n\r\n                     A_{στ′}  B^{στ′} = A_{μν} B^{μν}.\r\n\r\nFrom the inversion of (9) we have however\r\n\r\n$$ B_{\\mu \\nu} = \\frac{\\partial x_{\\mu}}{\\partial x_{\\sigma'}}\r\n\\frac{\\partial x_{\\nu}}{\\partial \\tau'} B^{\\sigma \\tau'} $$\r\n\r\nSubstitution of this for B^{μν} in the above equation gives\r\n\r\n$$ (A_{\\sigma \\tau'} - \\frac{\\partial x_{\\mu}}{\\partial x_{\\sigma'}}\r\n\\frac{\\partial x_{\\nu}}{\\partial x_{\\tau'}}) B^{\\sigma \\tau'} = 0 $$\r\n\r\nThis can be true, for any choice of B^{στ′} only when the term within\r\nthe bracket vanishes. From which by referring to (11), the theorem at\r\nonce follows. This law correspondingly holds for tensors of any rank and\r\ncharacter. The proof is quite similar. The law can also be put in the\r\nfollowing form. If B^{μ} and C^{ν} are any two vectors, and if for every\r\nchoice of them the inner product A_{μν} B^{μ} C^{ν} is a scalar, then\r\nA_{μν} is a co-variant tensor. The last law holds even when there is the\r\nmore special formulation, that with any arbitrary choice of the\r\nfour-vector B^{μ} alone the scalar product A_{μν} B^{μ} B^{ν} is a\r\nscalar, in which case we have the additional condition that A_{μν}\r\nsatisfies the symmetry condition. According to the method given above,\r\nwe prove the tensor character of (A_{μν} + A_{νμ}), from which on\r\naccount of symmetry follows the tensor-character of A_{μν}. This law can\r\neasily be generalized in the case of co-variant and contravariant\r\ntensors of any rank.\r\n\r\nFinally, from what has been proved, we can deduce the following law\r\nwhich can be easily generalized for any kind of tensor: If the\r\nquantities A_{μν} B^{ν} form a tensor of the first rank, when B^{ν} is\r\nany arbitrarily chosen four-vector, then A_{μν} is a tensor of the\r\nsecond rank. If for example, C^{μ} is any four-vector, then owing to the\r\ntensor character of A_{μν} B^{ν}, the inner product A_{μν} C^{μ} B^{ν}\r\nis a scalar, both the four-vectors C^{μ} and B^{ν} being arbitrarily\r\nchosen. Hence the proposition follows at once.\r\n\r\n\r\nA few words about the Fundamental Tensor _g__{μν}.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe co-variant fundamental tensor—In the invariant expression of the\r\nsquare of the linear element\r\n\r\n                     _ds²_ = _g__{μν} _dx__{μ} _dx__{ν}\r\n\r\n_dx__{μ} plays the rôle of any arbitrarily chosen contravariant vector,\r\nsince further _g__{μν} = _g__{νμ}, it follows from the considerations of\r\nthe last paragraph that _g__{μν} is a symmetrical co-variant tensor of\r\nthe second rank. We call it the “fundamental tensor.” Afterwards we\r\nshall deduce some properties of this tensor, which will also be true for\r\nany tensor of the second rank. But the special rôle of the fundamental\r\ntensor in our Theory, which has its physical basis on the particularly\r\nexceptional character of gravitation makes it clear that those relations\r\nare to be developed which will be required only in the case of the\r\nfundamental tensor.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The co-variant fundamental tensor._\r\n\r\n\r\nIf we form from the determinant scheme | _g__{μν} | the minors of\r\n_g__{μν} and divide them by the determinant _g_ = | _g__{μν} | we get\r\ncertain quantities _g_^{μν} = _g_^{νμ}, which as we shall prove\r\ngenerates a contravariant tensor.\r\n\r\nAccording to the well-known law of Determinants\r\n\r\n                     (16) _g__{μσ} _g_^{νσ} = δ_{μ}^{ν}\r\n\r\nwhere δ_{μ}^{ν} is 1, or 0, according as μ = ν or not. Instead of the\r\nabove expression for _ds²_, we can also write\r\n\r\n                    _g__{μσ} δ_{ν}^{σ} _dx__{μ} _dx__{ν}\r\n\r\nor according to (16) also in the form\r\n\r\n                _g__{μσ} _g__{ντ} _g_^{στ} _dx__{μ} _dx__{ν}\r\n\r\nNow according to the rules of multiplication, of the fore-going\r\nparagraph, the magnitudes\r\n\r\n                        _d_ξ_{σ} = _g__{μσ} _dx__{μ}\r\n\r\nforms a co-variant four-vector, and in fact (on account of the arbitrary\r\nchoice of _dx__{μ}) any arbitrary four-vector.\r\n\r\nIf we introduce it in our expression, we get\r\n\r\n                    _ds²_ = _g_^{στ} _d_ξ_{σ} _d_ξ_{τ}.\r\n\r\nFor any choice of the vectors _d_ξ_{σ} _d_ξ_{τ} this is scalar, and\r\n_g_^{στ}, according to its definition is a symmetrical thing in σ and τ,\r\nso it follows from the above results, that _g_^{στ} is a contravariant\r\ntensor. Out of (16) it also follows that δ^{ν}_{μ} is a tensor which we\r\nmay call the mixed fundamental tensor.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Determinant of the fundamental tensor._\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to the law of multiplication of determinants, we have\r\n\r\n             | _g__{μα} _g_^{αν} | = | _g__{μα} | | _g_^{αν} |\r\n\r\nOn the other hand we have\r\n\r\n                 | _g__{μα} _g_^{αν} | = | δ^{ν}_{μ} | = 1\r\n\r\nSo that it follows (17) that | _g__{μν} | | _g_^{μν} | = 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Invariant of volume._\r\n\r\n\r\nWe see first the transformation law for the determinant _g_ = | _g__{μν}\r\n|.

The invariant √(-_g_)_d_τ, is equal in magnitude to the\r\nfour-dimensional volume-element measured with solid rods and clocks, in\r\naccordance with the special relativity theory.\r\n\r\n_Remarks on the character of the space-time continuum_—Our assumption\r\nthat in an infinitely small region the special relativity theory holds,\r\nleads us to conclude that _ds²_ can always, according to (1) be\r\nexpressed in real magnitudes _d_X₁ ... _d_X_{_h_}. If we call _d_τ₀ the\r\n“_natural_” volume element _d_X₁ _d_X₂ _d_X₃ _d_X₄ we have thus (18a)\r\n_d_τ₀ = √(_g_)_i_τ.\r\n\r\nShould √(-_g_) vanish at any point of the four-dimensional continuum it\r\nwould signify that to a finite co-ordinate volume at the place\r\ncorresponds an infinitely small “natural volume.” This can never be the\r\ncase; so that _g_ can never change its sign; we would, according to the\r\nspecial relativity theory assume that _g_ has a finite negative value.\r\nIt is a hypothesis about the physical nature of the continuum\r\nconsidered, and also a pre-established rule for the choice of\r\nco-ordinates.\r\n\r\nIf however (-_g_) remains positive and finite, it is clear that the\r\nchoice of co-ordinates can be so made that this quantity becomes equal\r\nto one. We would afterwards see that such a limitation of the choice of\r\nco-ordinates would produce a significant simplification in expressions\r\nfor laws of nature.\r\n\r\nIn place of (18) it follows then simply that\r\n\r\n                                _d_τ′ = _d_\r\n\r\nfrom this it follows, remembering the law of Jacobi,\r\n\r\n(19)\r\n\r\n$$ | \\frac{\\partial x'_{\\sigma}}{dx_{\\mu}} | = 1 $$\r\n\r\nWith this choice of co-ordinates, only substitutions with determinant 1\r\nare allowable.\r\n\r\nIt would however be erroneous to think that this step signifies a\r\npartial renunciation of the general relativity postulate. We do not seek\r\nthose laws of nature which are co-variants with regard to the\r\ntransformations having the determinant 1, but we ask: what are the\r\ngeneral co-variant laws of nature? First we get the law, and then we\r\nsimplify its expression by a special choice of the system of reference.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Building up of new tensors with the help of the fundamental tensor._\r\n\r\n\r\nThrough inner, outer and mixed multiplications of a tensor with the\r\nfundamental tensor, tensors of other kinds and of other ranks can be\r\nformed.\r\n\r\nExample:—\r\n\r\n                           A^{μ} = _g_^{μσ} A_{σ}\r\n\r\n                           A = _g__{μν} A^{μν}\r\n\r\nWe would point out specially the following combinations:\r\n\r\n                     A^{μν} = _g_^{μα} _g_^{νβ} A_{αβ}\r\n\r\n                     A_{μν} = _g__{μα} _g__{νβ} A^{αβ}\r\n\r\n(complement to the co-variant or contravariant tensors)\r\n\r\n                   and B_{μν} =  _g__{μν} _g_^{αβ} A_{αβ}\r\n\r\nWe can call B_{μν} the reduced tensor related to A_{μν}.\r\n\r\nSimilarly\r\n\r\n                      B^{μν} = _g_^{μν}_g__{αβ}A^{αβ}.\r\n\r\nIt is to be remarked that _g_^{μν} is no other than the “complement” of\r\n_g__{μν} for we have,—\r\n\r\n          _g_^{μα}_g_^{νβ}_g__{αβ} = _g__{μα}δ^{ν}_{α} = _g_^{μν}.\r\n\r\n\r\n        § 9. Equation of the geodetic line (or of point-motion).\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the “line element” _ds_ is a definite magnitude independent of the\r\nco-ordinate system, we have also between two points P₁ and P₂ of a four\r\ndimensional continuum a line for which ∫_ds_ is an extremum (geodetic\r\nline), _i.e._, one which has got a significance independent of the\r\nchoice of co-ordinates.\r\n\r\nIts equation is\r\n\r\n                       (20) δ{ ∫^{P₂}_{P₁} _ds_ } = 0\r\n\r\nFrom this equation, we can in a wellknown way deduce 4 total\r\ndifferential equations which define the geodetic line; this deduction is\r\ngiven here for the sake of completeness.\r\n\r\nLet λ, be a function of the co-ordinates _x__{ν}; this defines a series\r\nof surfaces which cut the geodetic line sought-for as well as all\r\nneighbouring lines from P₁ to P₂. We can suppose that all such curves\r\nare given when the value of its co-ordinates _x__{ν} are given in terms\r\nof λ. The sign δ corresponds to a passage from a point of the geodetic\r\ncurve sought-for to a point of the contiguous curve, both lying on the\r\nsame surface λ.\r\n\r\nThen (20) can be replaced by\r\n\r\n                   { λ₃\r\n                   { ∫δω _d_λ = 0\r\n           (20a)   { λ₁\r\n                   {\r\n                   { ω² = _g__{μν}(_dx__{μ}/_d_λ)(_dx__{ν}/_d_λ)\r\n\r\nBut\r\n\r\n    δω = (1/ω){½(∂_g__{μν}/∂_x__{σ}) · (_dx__{μ}/_d_λ) · (_dx__{ν}/_d_λ)\r\n       · δ_x__{σ}\r\n      + _g__{μν}(_dx__{μ}/_d_λ)δ(_dx__{ν}/_d_λ)}\r\n\r\nSo we get by the substitution of δω in (20a), remembering that\r\n\r\n                  δ(_dx__{ν}/_d_λ) = (_d_/_d_λ)(δ_x__{ν})\r\n\r\nafter partial integration,\r\n\r\n            { λ₃\r\n            { ∫ _d_λ _k__{σ} δ_x__{σ} = 0\r\n    (20b)   { λ₁\r\n            {\r\n            { where _k__{σ} = (_d_/_d_λ){(_g__{μν}/ω) · (_dx__{μ}/_d_λ)}\r\n               - (1/(2ω))(∂_g__{μν}/∂_x__{σ}\r\n\r\n                × (_dx__{μ}/_d_λ) · (_dx__{ν}/_d_λ).\r\n\r\nFrom which it follows, since the choice of δν_{σ} is perfectly arbitrary\r\nthat _k__{σ}_’s_ should vanish. Then\r\n\r\n                (20c)      _k__{σ} = 0      (σ = 1, 2, 3, 4)\r\n\r\nare the equations of geodetic line; since along the geodetic line\r\nconsidered we have _ds_ ≠ 0, we can choose the parameter λ, as the\r\nlength of the arc measured along the geodetic line. Then _w_ = 1, and we\r\nwould get in place of (20c)\r\n\r\n$$ g_{\\mu\\nu} \\frac{\\partial^2 x_{\\mu}}{\\partial s^2} + \\frac{\\partial\r\ng_{\\mu\\nu}}{\\partial x_{\\sigma}} \\frac{\\partial x_{\\sigma}}{\\partial s}\r\n\\frac{\\partial x_{\\mu}}{\\partial s} - \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\partial\r\ng_{\\mu\\sigma}}{\\partial x_{\\nu}} \\frac{\\partial x_{\\mu}}{\\partial s}\r\n\\frac{\\partial x_{\\sigma}}{\\partial s} = 0 $$\r\n\r\nOr by merely changing the notation suitably,\r\n\r\n(20d) $$ g_{\\alpha\\sigma} \\frac{d^2 x_{\\alpha}}{ds^2} +\r\n\\begin{bmatrix}\\mu\\nu\\\\\\sigma\\end{bmatrix} \\frac{dx_{\\mu}}{ds}\r\n\\frac{dx_{\\nu}}{ds} = 0 $$\r\n\r\nwhere we have put, following Christoffel,\r\n\r\n(21)\r\n\r\n$$ \\begin{bmatrix}\\mu\\nu\\\\\\sigma\\end{bmatrix} = \\frac{1}{2}\r\n\\begin{bmatrix}\\frac{\\partial g_{\\mu\\sigma}}{\\partial x_{\\nu}} +\r\n\\frac{\\partial g_{\\nu\\sigma}}{\\partial x_{\\mu}} - \\frac{\\partial\r\ng_{\\mu\\nu}}{\\partial \\sigma}\\end{bmatrix} $$\r\n\r\nMultiply finally (20d) with _g_^{στ} (outer multiplication with\r\nreference to τ, and inner with respect to σ) we get at last the final\r\nform of the equation of the geodetic line—\r\n\r\n$$ \\frac{d^2 x_{\\tau}}{ds^2} + \\begin{Bmatrix}\\mu\\nu\\\\\\tau\\end{Bmatrix}\r\n\\frac{dx_{\\mu}}{ds} \\frac{dx_{\\nu}}{ds} = 0 $$\r\n\r\nHere we have put, following Christoffel,\r\n\r\n$$ \\begin{Bmatrix}\\mu\\nu\\\\\\tau\\end{Bmatrix} = g^{\\tau\\alpha}\r\n\\begin{bmatrix}\\mu\\nu\\\\\\alpha\\end{bmatrix} $$\r\n\r\n\r\n          § 10. Formation of Tensors through Differentiation.\r\n\r\n\r\nRelying on the equation of the geodetic line, we can now easily deduce\r\nlaws according to which new tensors can be formed from given tensors by\r\ndifferentiation. For this purpose, we would first establish the general\r\nco-variant differential equations. We achieve this through a repeated\r\napplication of the following simple law. If a certain curve be given in\r\nour continuum whose points are characterised by the arc-distances _s_,\r\nmeasured from a fixed point on the curve, and if further φ, be an\r\ninvariant space function, then _d_φ/_ds_ is also an invariant. The proof\r\nfollows from the fact that _d_φ as well as _ds_, are both invariants\r\n\r\nSince\r\n\r\n$$ \\frac{d \\phi}{ds} = \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial x_{\\mu}}\r\n\\frac{\\partial x_{\\mu}}{\\partial s} $$\r\n\r\nso that\r\n\r\n$$ \\psi = \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial x_{\\mu}} \\frac{dx_{\\mu}}{ds} $$\r\n\r\nis also an invariant for all curves which go out from a point in the\r\ncontinuum, _i.e._, for any choice of the vector _dx__{μ}. From which\r\nfollows immediately that\r\n\r\n                            A_{μ} = ∂φ/∂_x__{μ}\r\n\r\nis a co-variant four-vector (gradient of φ).\r\n\r\nAccording to our law, the differential-quotient χ = ∂ψ/∂_s_ taken along\r\nany curve is likewise an invariant.\r\n\r\nSubstituting the value of ψ, we get\r\n\r\n$$ \\chi = \\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi}{\\partial x_{\\mu} \\partial x_{\\nu}}\r\n\\frac{dx_{\\mu}}{ds} \\frac{dx_{\\nu}}{ds} + \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial\r\nx_{\\mu}} \\frac{d^2 x_{\\mu}}{ds^2} $$\r\n\r\nHere however we can not at once deduce the existence of any tensor. If\r\nwe however take that the curves along which we are differentiating are\r\ngeodesics, we get from it by replacing _d²__x__{ν}/_ds²_ according to\r\n(22)\r\n\r\n$$ \\chi = \\begin{bmatrix}\\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi}{\\partial x_{\\mu}\\partial\r\nx_{\\nu}} - \\begin{Bmatrix}\\mu\\nu\\\\\\tau\\end{Bmatrix} \\frac{\\partial\r\n\\phi}{\\partial x_{\\tau}} \\end{bmatrix} \\frac{dx_{\\mu}}{ds}\r\n\\frac{dx_{\\nu}}{ds} $$\r\n\r\nFrom the interchangeability of the differentiation with regard to μ and\r\nν, and also according to (23) and (21) we see that the bracket\r\n\r\n$$ \\begin{Bmatrix}\\mu\\nu\\\\\\tau\\end{Bmatrix} $$\r\n\r\nis symmetrical with respect to μ and ν.\r\n\r\nAs we can draw a geodetic line in any direction from any point in the\r\ncontinuum, ∂_x__{μ}/_ds_ is thus a four-vector, with an arbitrary ratio\r\nof components, so that it follows from the results of §7 that\r\n\r\n(25)\r\n\r\n$$ A_{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi}{\\partial x_{\\mu} \\partial\r\nx_{\\nu}} - \\begin{Bmatrix}\\mu\\nu\\\\\\tau\\end{Bmatrix} \\frac{\\partial\r\n\\phi}{\\partial x_{\\tau}} $$\r\n\r\nis a co-variant tensor of the second rank. We have thus got the result\r\nthat out of the co-variant tensor of the first rank A_{μ} = ∂φ/∂_x__{μ}\r\nwe can get by differentiation a co-variant tensor of 2nd rank\r\n\r\n(26)\r\n\r\n$$ A_{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{\\partial A_{\\mu}}{\\partial x_{\\nu}} -\r\n\\begin{Bmatrix}\\mu\\nu\\\\\\tau\\end{Bmatrix} A_{\\tau} $$\r\n\r\nWe call the tensor A_{μν} the “extension” of the tensor A_{μ}. Then we\r\ncan easily show that this combination also leads to a tensor, when the\r\nvector A_{μ} is not representable as a gradient. In order to see this we\r\nfirst remark that ψ (_d_φ/∂_x__{μ}) is a co-variant four-vector when ψ\r\nand φ are scalars. This is also the case for a sum of four such terms :—\r\n\r\n$$ S_{\\mu} = \\psi^{(1)} \\frac{\\partial \\phi^{(1)}}{\\partial x_{\\mu}} +\r\n... + \\psi^{(4)} \\frac{\\partial \\phi^{(4)}}{\\partial x_{\\mu}} $$\r\n\r\nwhen ψ^{(1)}, φ^{(1)} ... ψ^{(4)}, φ^{(4)} are scalars. Now it is\r\nhowever clear that every co-variant four-vector is representable in the\r\nform of S_{μ}.\r\n\r\nIf for example, A_{μ} is a four-vector whose components are any given\r\nfunctions of _x__{ν}, we have, (with reference to the chosen co-ordinate\r\nsystem) only to put\r\n\r\n                        ψ^{(1)} = A₁ φ^{(1)} = _x₁_\r\n\r\n                        ψ^{(2)} = A₂ φ^{(2)} = _x₂_\r\n\r\n                        ψ^{(3)} = A₃ φ^{(3)} = _x₃_\r\n\r\n                        ψ^{(4)} = A₄ φ^{(4)} = _x₄_.\r\n\r\nin order to arrive at the result that S_{μ} is equal to A_{μ}.\r\n\r\nIn order to prove then that A_{μν} is a tensor when on the right side of\r\n(26) we substitute any co-variant four-vector for A_{μ} we have only to\r\nshow that this is true for the four-vector S_{μ}. For this latter case,\r\nhowever, a glance on the right hand side of (26) will show that we have\r\nonly to bring forth the proof for the case when\r\n\r\n                           A_{μ} = ψ ∂φ/∂_x__{μ}.\r\n\r\nNow the right hand side of (25) multiplied by ψ is\r\n\r\n$$ \\psi \\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi}{\\partial x_{\\mu} \\partial x_{\\nu}} -\r\n\\begin{Bmatrix}\\mu\\nu\\\\\\tau\\end{Bmatrix} \\psi \\frac{\\partial\r\n\\phi}{\\partial x_{\\tau}} $$\r\n\r\nwhich has a tensor character. Similarly, (∂φ/∂_x__{μ}) (∂φ/∂_x__{ν}) is\r\nalso a tensor (outer product of two four-vectors).\r\n\r\nThrough addition follows the tensor character of\r\n\r\n$$ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_{\\nu}} (\\psi \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial\r\nx_{\\mu}}) - \\begin{Bmatrix}\\mu\\nu\\\\\\tau\\end{Bmatrix} (\\psi\r\n\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial x_{\\tau}}) $$\r\n\r\nThus we get the desired proof for the four-vector, ψ ∂φ/∂_x__{μ} and\r\nhence for any four-vectors A_{μ} as shown above.\r\n\r\nWith the help of the extension of the four-vector, we can easily define\r\n“extension” of a co-variant tensor of any rank. This is a generalisation\r\nof the extension of the four-vector. We confine ourselves to the case of\r\nthe extension of the tensors of the 2nd rank for which the law of\r\nformation can be clearly seen.\r\n\r\nAs already remarked every co-variant tensor of the 2nd rank can be\r\nrepresented as a sum of the tensors of the type A_{μ} B_{ν}.\r\n\r\nIt would therefore be sufficient to deduce the expression of extension,\r\nfor one such special tensor. According to (26) we have the expressions\r\n\r\n$$ \\frac{\\partial A_{\\mu}}{\\partial x_{\\sigma}} -\r\n\\begin{Bmatrix}\\sigma\\mu\\\\\\tau\\end{Bmatrix} A_{\\tau} $$\r\n\r\n$$ \\frac{\\partial B_{\\nu}}{\\partial x_{\\sigma}} -\r\n\\begin{Bmatrix}\\sigma\\mu\\\\\\tau\\end{Bmatrix} B_{\\tau} $$\r\n\r\nare tensors. Through outer multiplication of the first with B_{ν} and\r\nthe 2nd with A_{μ} we get tensors of the third rank. Their addition\r\ngives the tensor of the third rank\r\n\r\n(27)\r\n\r\n$$ A_{\\mu\\nu\\sigma} = \\frac{\\partial A_{\\mu\\nu}}{\\partial x_{\\sigma}} -\r\n\\begin{Bmatrix}\\sigma\\mu\\\\\\tau\\end{Bmatrix} A_{\\tau\\nu} -\r\n\\begin{Bmatrix}\\sigma\\nu\\\\\\tau\\end{Bmatrix} A_{\\mu\\tau} $$\r\n\r\nwhere A_{μν} is put = A_{μ} B_{ν}. The right hand side of (27) is linear\r\nand homogeneous with reference to A_{μν}, and its first differential\r\nco-efficient, so that this law of formation leads to a tensor not only\r\nin the case of a tensor of the type A_{μ} B_{ν} but also in the case of\r\na summation for all such tensors, _i.e._, in the case of any co-variant\r\ntensor of the second rank. We call A_{μνσ} the extension of the tensor\r\nA_{μν}. It is clear that (26) and (24) are only special cases of (27)\r\n(extension of the tensors of the first and zero rank). In general we can\r\nget all special laws of formation of tensors from (27) combined with\r\ntensor multiplication.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome special cases of Particular Importance.\r\n\r\n\r\n_A few auxiliary lemmas concerning the fundamental tensor._ We shall\r\nfirst deduce some of the lemmas much used afterwards.

The Riemann-Christoffel Tensor.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe now seek only those tensors, which can be obtained from the\r\nfundamental tensor _g_^{μν} by differentiation alone. It is found\r\neasily. We put in (27) instead of any tensor A^{μν} the fundamental\r\ntensor _g_^{μν} and get from it a new tensor, namely the extension of\r\nthe fundamental tensor. We can easily convince ourselves that this\r\nvanishes identically. We prove it in the following way; we substitute in\r\n(27)\r\n\r\n$$ A_{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{\\partial A_{\\mu}}{\\partial x_{\\nu}} -\r\n\\begin{Bmatrix}\\mu & & \\nu\\ \\rho&\\end{Bmatrix} A_{\\rho} $$\r\n\r\n_i.e._, the extension of a four-vector.\r\n\r\nThus we get (by slightly changing the indices) the tensor of the third\r\nrank\r\n\r\n$$ A_{\\mu\\sigma\\tau} = \\frac{\\partial^2 A_{\\mu}}{\\partial x_{\\sigma}\r\n\\partial x_{\\tau}} - \\begin{Bmatrix}\\mu & & \\sigma\\ \\rho&\\end{Bmatrix}\r\n\\frac{\\partial A_{\\rho}}{\\partial x_{\\tau}} - \\begin{Bmatrix}\\mu & &\r\n\\tau\\ \\rho&\\end{Bmatrix} \\frac{\\partial A_{\\rho}}{\\partial x_{\\sigma}} -\r\n\\begin{Bmatrix}\\sigma & & \\tau\\ \\rho&\\end{Bmatrix} \\frac{\\partial\r\nA_{\\mu}}{\\partial x_{\\rho}} + \\begin{bmatrix} - \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\r\nx_{\\tau}} \\begin{Bmatrix}\\mu&&\\sigma\\ \\rho&\\end{Bmatrix} +\r\n\\begin{Bmatrix}\\mu&&\\tau\\ \\alpha\\end{Bmatrix}\r\n\\begin{Bmatrix}\\alpha&&\\sigma\\ \\rho&\\end{Bmatrix} +\r\n\\begin{Bmatrix}\\sigma&&\\tau\\ \\alpha\\end{Bmatrix}\r\n\\begin{Bmatrix}\\alpha&&\\mu\\ \\rho&\\end{Bmatrix} \\end{bmatrix} A_{\\rho} $$\r\n\r\nWe use these expressions for the formation of the tensor A_{μστ} -\r\nA_{μτσ}. Thereby the following terms in A_{μστ} cancel the corresponding\r\nterms in A_{μτσ}; the first member, the fourth member, as well as the\r\nmember corresponding to the last term within the square bracket. These\r\nare all symmetrical in σ, and τ. The same is true for the sum of the\r\nsecond and third members. We thus get\r\n\r\n(43)\r\n\r\n$$ A_{\\mu\\sigma\\tau} - A_{\\mu\\tau\\sigma} = B^{\\rho}_{\\mu\\sigma\\tau}\r\nA_{\\rho} $$\r\n\r\n$$ B^{\\rho}_{\\mu\\sigma\\tau} = - \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_{\\tau}}\r\n\\begin{Bmatrix}\\mu & & \\sigma\\ \\rho&\\end{Bmatrix} +\r\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_{\\sigma}} \\begin{Bmatrix}\\mu & &\r\n\\tau\\ \\rho&\\end{Bmatrix} - \\begin{Bmatrix}\\mu & &\r\n\\sigma\\ \\alpha&\\end{Bmatrix} \\begin{Bmatrix}\\alpha & &\r\n\\tau\\ \\rho&\\end{Bmatrix} + \\begin{Bmatrix}\\mu & &\r\n\\tau\\ \\alpha&\\end{Bmatrix} \\begin{Bmatrix}\\alpha & &\r\n\\sigma\\ \\rho&\\end{Bmatrix} $$\r\n\r\nThe essential thing in this result is that on the right hand side of\r\n(42) we have only A_{ρ}, but not its differential co-efficients. From\r\nthe tensor-character of A_{μστ} - A_{μτσ}, and from the fact that A_{ρ}\r\nis an arbitrary four vector, it follows, on account of the result of §7,\r\nthat B^{ρ}_{μστ} is a tensor (Riemann-Christoffel Tensor).\r\n\r\nThe mathematical significance of this tensor is as follows; when the\r\ncontinuum is so shaped, that there is a co-ordinate system for which\r\n_g__{μν}_’s_ are constants, B^{ρ}_{μστ} all vanish.\r\n\r\nIf we choose instead of the original co-ordinate system any new one, so\r\nwould the _g__{μν}’s referred to this last system be no longer\r\nconstants. The tensor character of B^{ρ}_{μστ} shows us, however, that\r\nthese components vanish collectively also in any other chosen system of\r\nreference. The vanishing of the Riemann Tensor is thus a necessary\r\ncondition that for some choice of the axis-system _g__{μν}’s can be\r\ntaken as constants. In our problem it corresponds to the case when by a\r\nsuitable choice of the co-ordinate system, the special relativity theory\r\nholds throughout any finite region. By the reduction of (43) with\r\nreference to indices to τ and ρ, we get the covariant tensor of the\r\nsecond rank\r\n\r\n(44)\r\n\r\n$$ B_{\\mu\\nu} = R_{\\mu\\nu} + S_{\\mu\\nu} $$\r\n\r\n$$ R_{\\mu\\nu} = - \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_{\\alpha}}\r\n\\begin{Bmatrix}\\mu & & \\nu\\ \\alpha&\\end{Bmatrix} + \\begin{Bmatrix}\\mu\r\n& & \\alpha\\ \\beta&\\end{Bmatrix} \\begin{Bmatrix}\\nu & &\r\n\\beta\\ \\alpha&\\end{Bmatrix} $$\r\n\r\n$$ S_{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{\\partial \\log \\sqrt{-g}}{\\partial x_{\\mu} \\partial\r\nx_{\\nu}} - \\begin{Bmatrix}\\mu & & \\nu\\ \\alpha&\\end{Bmatrix}\r\n\\frac{\\partial \\log \\sqrt{-g}}{\\partial x_{\\alpha}} $$\r\n\r\n\r\n_Remarks upon the choice of co-ordinates._—It has already been remarked\r\nin §8, with reference to the equation (18a), that the co-ordinates can\r\nwith advantage be so chosen that √(-_g_) = 1. A glance at the equations\r\ngot in the last two paragraphs shows that, through such a choice, the\r\nlaw of formation of the tensors suffers a significant simplification. It\r\nis specially true for the tensor B_{μν}, which plays a fundamental rôle\r\nin the theory. By this simplification, S_{μν} vanishes of itself so that\r\ntensor B_{μν} reduces to R_{μν}.\r\n\r\nI shall give in the following pages all relations in the simplified\r\nform, with the above-named specialisation of the co-ordinates. It is\r\nthen very easy to go back to the general covariant equations, if it\r\nappears desirable in any special case.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 C. THE THEORY OF THE GRAVITATION-FIELD\r\n\r\n\r\n  §13. Equation of motion of a material point in a gravitation-field.\r\n          Expression for the field-components of gravitation.\r\n\r\n\r\nA freely moving body not acted on by external forces moves, according to\r\nthe special relativity theory, along a straight line and uniformly. This\r\nalso holds for the generalised relativity theory for any part of the\r\nfour-dimensional region, in which the co-ordinates K_{0} can be, and\r\nare, so chosen that _g__{μν}’s have special constant values of the\r\nexpression (4).\r\n\r\nLet us discuss this motion from the stand-point of any arbitrary\r\nco-ordinate-system K₁; it moves with reference to K₁ (as explained in\r\n§2) in a gravitational field. The laws of motion with reference to K₁\r\nfollow easily from the following consideration. With reference to K₀,\r\nthe law of motion is a four-dimensional straight line and thus a\r\ngeodesic. As a geodetic-line is defined independently of the system of\r\nco-ordinates, it would also be the law of motion for the motion of the\r\nmaterial-point with reference to K₁. If we put\r\n\r\n(45) $$ \\Gamma^{\\tau}_{\\mu\\nu} = - \\begin{Bmatrix}\\mu & &\r\n\\nu\\ \\tau&\\end{Bmatrix} $$\r\n\r\nwe get the motion of the point with reference to K₁, given by\r\n\r\n(46) $$ \\frac{d^2 x_{\\tau}}{ds^2} = \\Gamma^{\\tau}_{\\mu\\nu}\r\n\\frac{dx_{\\mu}}{ds} \\frac{dx_{\\nu}}{ds} $$\r\n\r\nWe now make the very simple assumption that this general covariant\r\nsystem of equations defines also the motion of the point in the\r\ngravitational field, when there exists no reference-system K₀, with\r\nreference to which the special relativity theory holds throughout a\r\nfinite region. The assumption seems to us to be all the more legitimate,\r\nas (46) contains only the first differentials of _g__{μν}, among which\r\nthere is no relation in the special case when K₀ exists.\r\n\r\nIf γ_{μν}^{τ}’s vanish, the point moves uniformly and in a straight\r\nline; these magnitudes therefore determine the deviation from\r\nuniformity. They are the components of the gravitational field.\r\n\r\n\r\n    §14. The Field-equation of Gravitation in the absence of matter.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the following, we differentiate gravitation-field from matter in the\r\nsense that everything besides the gravitation-field will be signified as\r\nmatter; therefore the term includes not only matter in the usual sense,\r\nbut also the electro-dynamic field. Our next problem is to seek the\r\nfield-equations of gravitation in the absence of matter. For this we\r\napply the same method as employed in the foregoing paragraph for the\r\ndeduction of the equations of motion for material points. A special case\r\nin which the field-equations sought-for are evidently satisfied is that\r\nof the special relativity theory in which _g__{μν}’s have certain\r\nconstant values. This would be the case in a certain finite region with\r\nreference to a definite co-ordinate system K₀. With reference to this\r\nsystem, all the components B^{ρ}_{μστ} of the Riemann’s Tensor [equation\r\n43] vanish. These vanish then also in the region considered, with\r\nreference to every other co-ordinate system.\r\n\r\nThe equations of the gravitation-field free from matter must thus be in\r\nevery case satisfied when all B^{ρ}_{μστ} vanish. But this condition is\r\nclearly one which goes too far. For it is clear that the\r\ngravitation-field generated by a material point in its own neighbourhood\r\ncan never be transformed _away_ by any choice of axes, _i.e._, it cannot\r\nbe transformed to a case of constant _g__{μν}’s.\r\n\r\nTherefore it is clear that, for a gravitational field free from matter,\r\nit is desirable that the symmetrical tensors B_{μν} deduced from the\r\ntensors B^{ρ}_{μστ} should vanish. We thus get 10 equations for 10\r\nquantities _g__{μν} which are fulfilled in the special case when\r\nB^{ρ}_{μστ}’s all vanish.\r\n\r\nRemembering (44) we see that in absence of matter the field-equations\r\ncome out as follows; (when referred to the special co-ordinate-system\r\nchosen.)\r\n\r\n(47) $$ \\frac{\\partial \\Gamma^{\\alpha}_{\\mu\\nu}}{\\partial x_{\\alpha}} +\r\n\\Gamma^{\\alpha}_{\\mu\\beta} \\Gamma^{\\beta}_{\\mu\\alpha} = 0 $$\r\n\r\n$$ \\sqrt{-g} = 1 $$\r\n\r\n$$ \\Gamma^{\\alpha}_{\\mu\\nu} = - \\begin{Bmatrix}\\mu & &\r\n\\nu\\ \\alpha&\\end{Bmatrix} $$\r\n\r\nIt can also be shown that the choice of these equations is connected\r\nwith a minimum of arbitrariness. For besides B_{μν}, there is no tensor\r\nof the second rank, which can be built out of _g__{μν}’s and their\r\nderivatives no higher than the second, and which is also linear in them.\r\n\r\nIt will be shown that the equations arising in a purely mathematical way\r\nout of the conditions of the general relativity, together with equations\r\n(46), give us the Newtonian law of attraction as a first approximation,\r\nand lead in the second approximation to the explanation of the\r\nperihelion-motion of mercury discovered by Leverrier (the residual\r\neffect which could not be accounted for by the consideration of all\r\nsorts of disturbing factors). My view is that these are convincing\r\nproofs of the physical correctness of my theory.\r\n\r\n\r\n          §15.

For this purpose, let us consider H as a function of\r\n_g_^{μν} and _g_^{μν}_{σ} (= ∂_g_^{μν}/∂_x__{σ})\r\n\r\nWe have at first\r\n\r\n    δH = Γ^{α}_{μβ} Γ^{β}_{να} δ_g_^{μν} + 2_g_^{μν} Γ^{α}_{μβ}\r\n       δΓ^{β}_{να}\r\n\r\n    = - Γ^{α}_{μβ} Γ^{β}_{να} δ_g_^{μν} + 2Γ^{α}_{μβ}\r\n       δ(_g_^{μν}Γ^{β}_{να}).\r\n\r\nBut\r\n\r\n$$ \\delta(g^{\\mu\\nu} \\Gamma^{\\beta}_{\\nu\\alpha}) = - \\frac{1}{2}\r\n\\delta \\begin{bmatrix}g^{\\mu\\nu} & g^{\\beta\\lambda}\\end{bmatrix}\r\n(\\frac{\\partial g_{\\nu\\lambda}}{\\partial x_{\\alpha}} +\r\n\\frac{\\partial g_{\\alpha\\lambda}}{\\partial x_{\\nu}} - \\frac{\\partial\r\ng_{\\alpha\\nu}}{\\partial x_{\\lambda}}) $$\r\n\r\nThe terms arising out of the two last terms within the round bracket are\r\nof different signs, and change into one another by the interchange of\r\nthe indices μ and β. They cancel each other in the expression for δH,\r\nwhen they are multiplied by Γ_{μβ}^{α}, which is symmetrical with\r\nrespect to μ and β, so that only the first member of the bracket remains\r\nfor our consideration. Remembering (31), we thus have:—\r\n\r\n      δH = -Γ_{μβ}^{α} Γ_{να}^{β} δ_g_^{μν} + Γ_{μβ}^{α} δ_g__{α}^{μβ}\r\n\r\nTherefore\r\n\r\n                   (48)\r\n                   ∂H/∂_g_^{μν} = -Γ_{μβ}^{α} Γ_{να}^{β}\r\n\r\n                   ∂H/∂_g__{σ}^{μν} = Γ_{μν}^{σ}\r\n\r\nIf we now carry out the variations in (47a), we obtain the system of\r\nequations\r\n\r\n         (47b) ∂/∂_x__{α} ( ∂H/∂_g__{α}^{μν} ) - ∂H/∂_g_^{μν} = 0,\r\n\r\nwhich, owing to the relations (48), coincide with (47), as was required\r\nto be proved.\r\n\r\nIf (47b) is multiplied by _g__{σ}^{μν}, since\r\n\r\n              ∂_g__{σ}^{μν}/∂_x__{α} = ∂_g__{α}^{μν}/∂_x__{σ}\r\n\r\nand consequently\r\n\r\n    _g__{σ}^{μν} ∂/∂_x__{α} (∂H/∂_g__{α}^{μν}) = ∂/∂_x__{α}\r\n       (_g__{σ}^{μν} ∂H/∂_g__{α}^{μν})\r\n    - ∂H/∂_g__{α}^{μν} ∂_g__{α}^{μν}/∂_x__{σ}\r\n\r\nwe obtain the equation\r\n\r\n        ∂/∂_x__{α} (_g__{σ}^{μν} ∂H/∂_g__{α}^{μν}) - ∂H/∂_x__{σ} = 0\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n         { ∂_t__{σ}^α/∂_x__{α} = 0\r\n\r\n    (49) { -2κ_t__{σ}^{α} = _g__{σ}^{μν} ∂H/∂_g__{α}^{μν} - δ_{σ}^{α} H.\r\n\r\nOwing to the relations (48), the equations (47) and (34),\r\n\r\n       (50) κ_t__{σ}^{α} = ½ δ_{σ}^{α} _g_^{μν} Γ_{μβ}^{α} Γ_{να}^{β}\r\n       - _g_^{μν} Γ_{μβ}^{α} Γ_{νσ}^{β}.\r\n\r\nIt is to be noticed that _t__{σ}^{α} is not a tensor, so that the\r\nequation (49) holds only for systems for which √-_g_ = 1. This equation\r\nexpresses the laws of conservation of impulse and energy in a\r\ngravitation-field. In fact, the integration of this equation over a\r\nthree-dimensional volume V leads to the four equations\r\n\r\n             (49a) _d_/_dx₄_ {∫_t__{σ}^4 _d_V} = ∫(_t__{σ}^1 α₁\r\n             + _t__{σ}² α₂ + _t__{σ}³ α₃)_d_S\r\n\r\nwhere α₁, α₂, α₂ are the direction-cosines of the inward-drawn normal to\r\nthe surface-element _d_S in the Euclidean Sense. We recognise in this\r\nthe usual expression for the laws of conservation. We denote the\r\nmagnitudes _t_^α_{σ} as the energy-components of the gravitation-field.\r\n\r\nI will now put the equation (47) in a third form which will be very\r\nserviceable for a quick realisation of our object. By multiplying the\r\nfield-equations (47) with _g_^{νσ}, these are obtained in the mixed\r\nforms. If we remember that\r\n\r\n    _g_^{νσ} ∂Γ^α_{μν}/∂_x__{α} = ∂/∂_x__{α} (_g_^{νσ} Γ^α_{μν}) -\r\n       ∂_g_^{νσ}/∂_x__{α} Γ^α_{μν},\r\n\r\nwhich owing to (34) is equal to\r\n\r\n       ∂/∂_x__{α} (._g_^{νσ} Γ^α_{μν}) - _g_^{νβ} Γ^σ_{αβ} Γγ^α_{μν}\r\n       - _g_^{σβ} Γ^ν_{βα} Γ^α_{μν},\r\n\r\nor slightly altering the notation, equal to\r\n\r\n       ∂/∂_x__{α} (_g_^{σβ} Γ^α_{μβ}) - _g_^{mn} Γ^σ_{mβ} Γ^β_{_n_μ}\r\n       - _g_^{νσ} Γ^α_{μβ} Γ^β_{να}.\r\n\r\nThe third member of this expression cancels with the second member of\r\nthe field-equations (47). In place of the second term of this\r\nexpression, we can, on account of the relations (50), put\r\n\r\n            κ (_t_^σ_{μ} - ½ δ^σ_{μ} _t_), where _t_ = _t_^α_{α}\r\n\r\nTherefore in the place of the equations (47), we obtain\r\n\r\n    (51) { ∂/∂_x__{α} (_g_^{σβ} Γ^α_{μβ}) = -κ(_t_^σ_{μ} - ½ δ^σ_{μ}\r\n       _t_)\r\n\r\n         { √(-_g_) = 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n     §16. General formulation of the field-equation of Gravitation.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe field-equations established in the preceding paragraph for spaces\r\nfree from matter is to be compared with the equation ▽²φ = 0 of the\r\nNewtonian theory. We have now to find the equations which will\r\ncorrespond to Poisson’s Equation ▽²φ = 4πκρ (ρ signifies the density of\r\nmatter).\r\n\r\nThe special relativity theory has led to the conception that the\r\ninertial mass (Träge Masse) is no other than energy. It can also be\r\nfully expressed mathematically by a symmetrical tensor of the second\r\nrank, the energy-tensor. We have therefore to introduce in our\r\ngeneralised theory energy-tensor τ^α_{σ} associated with matter, which\r\nlike the energy components _t_^α_{σ} of the gravitation-field (equations\r\n49, and 50) have a mixed character but which however can be connected\r\nwith symmetrical covariant tensors. The equation (51) teaches us how to\r\nintroduce the energy-tensor (corresponding to the density of Poisson’s\r\nequation) in the field equations of gravitation. If we consider a\r\ncomplete system (for example the Solar-system) its total mass, as also\r\nits total gravitating action, will depend on the total energy of the\r\nsystem, ponderable as well as gravitational. This can be expressed, by\r\nputting in (51), in place of energy-components _t__{μ}^σ of\r\ngravitation-field alone the sum of the energy-components of matter and\r\ngravitation, _i.e._,\r\n\r\n                            _t__{μ}^σ + T_{μ}^σ.\r\n\r\nWe thus get instead of (51), the tensor-equation\r\n\r\n(52) $$ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_{\\alpha}} (g^{\\sigma\beta}\r\n\\Gamma^{\u0007lpha}_{\\mu\\beta}) = - \\kappa [(t^{\\sigma}_{\\mu} +\r\nT^{\\sigma}_{\\mu}) - \\frac{1}{2} \\delta^{\\sigma}_{\\mu} (t + T)] $$ $$\r\n\\sqrt{-g} = 1 $$\r\n\r\nwhere T = T_{μ}^μ (Laue’s Scalar). These are the general field-equations\r\nof gravitation in the mixed form. In place of (47), we get by working\r\nbackwards the system\r\n\r\n(53) $$ \\frac{\\partial \\Gamma^{\u0007lpha}_{\\mu u}}{\\partial x_{\\alpha}} +\r\n\\Gamma^{\u0007lpha}_{\\mu\\beta} \\Gamma^{\beta}_{\\nu\\alpha} = - \\kappa\r\n(T_{\\mu\\nu} - \\frac{1}{2} g_{\\mu\\nu} T) $$\r\n\r\n$$ \\sqrt{-g} = 1 $$\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted, that this introduction of the energy-tensor of\r\nmatter cannot be justified by means of the Relativity-Postulate alone;\r\nfor we have in the foregoing analysis deduced it from the condition that\r\nthe energy of the gravitation-field should exert gravitating action in\r\nthe same way as every other kind of energy. The strongest ground for the\r\nchoice of the above equation however lies in this, that they lead, as\r\ntheir consequences, to equations expressing the conservation of the\r\ncomponents of total energy (the impulses and the energy) which exactly\r\ncorrespond to the equations (49) and (49a). This shall be shown\r\nafterwards.\r\n\r\n\r\n           §17. The laws of conservation in the general case.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe equations (52) can be easily so transformed that the second member\r\non the right-hand side vanishes. We reduce (52) with reference to the\r\nindices μ and σ and subtract the equation so obtained after\r\nmultiplication with ½ δ_{μ}^σ from (52).\r\n\r\nWe obtain,\r\n\r\n     (52a) ∂/∂_x__{α}(_g_^{σβ} Γ_{μβ}^α - ½ δ_{μ}^σ _g_^{λβ} Γ_{λβ}^α)\r\n     = -κ(_t__{μ}^σ + T_{μ}^σ)\r\n\r\nwe operate on it by ∂/∂_x__{σ}. Now,\r\n\r\n       ∂²/∂_x__{α}∂_x__{σ} (_g_^{σβ}Γ_{μβ}^α)\r\n       = -½ ∂²/∂_x__{α}∂_x__{σ} [_g_^{σβ} _g_^{αλ}(∂_g__{μλ}/∂_x__{β}\r\n        + ∂_g__{βλ}/∂_x__{μ} - ∂_g__{μβ}/∂_x__{λ})].\r\n\r\nThe first and the third member of the round bracket lead to expressions\r\nwhich cancel one another, as can be easily seen by interchanging the\r\nsummation-indices α, and σ, on the one hand, and β and λ, on the other.\r\n\r\nThe second term can be transformed according to (31). So that we get,\r\n\r\n                (54) ∂²/∂_x__{α}∂_x__{σ} (_g_^{σβ}γ_{μβ}^α)\r\n                 = ½ ∂³_g_^{αβ}/∂_x__{σ}∂_x__{β}∂_x__{μ}\r\n\r\nThe second member of the expression on the left-hand side of (52a) leads\r\nfirst to\r\n\r\n      - ½ ∂²/∂_x__{α}∂_x__{μ} (_g_^{λβ}Γ_{λβ}^α) or\r\n\r\n      to 1/4 ∂²/∂_x__{α}∂_x__{μ} [_g_^{λβ}_g_^{αδ}( ∂_g__{δλ}/∂_x__{β}\r\n       + ∂_g__{δβ}/∂_x__{λ} - ∂_g__{λβ}/∂_x__{δ})].\r\n\r\nThe expression arising out of the last member within the round bracket\r\nvanishes according to (29) on account of the choice of axes. The two\r\nothers can be taken together and give us on account of (31), the\r\nexpression\r\n\r\n                   -½ ∂³_g_^{αβ}/∂_x__{α}∂_x__{β}∂_x__{μ}\r\n\r\nSo that remembering (54) we have\r\n\r\n                 (55) ∂²/∂_x__{α}∂_x__{σ} (_g_^{σβ}Γ_{μβ}^α\r\n                  - ½ δ_{μ}^σ _g_^{λβ} Γ_{λβ}^α) = 0.\r\n\r\nidentically.\r\n\r\nFrom (55) and (52a) it follows that\r\n\r\n                 (56) ∂/∂_x__{σ} (_t__{μ}^σ + T_{μ}^σ) = 0\r\n\r\nFrom the field equations of gravitation, it also follows that the\r\nconservation-laws of impulse and energy are satisfied. We see it most\r\nsimply following the same reasoning which lead to equations (49a); only\r\ninstead of the energy-components of the gravitational-field, we are to\r\nintroduce the total energy-components of matter and gravitational field.\r\n\r\n\r\n     §18. The Impulse-energy law for matter as a consequence of the\r\n                            field-equations.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf we multiply (53) with ∂_g_^{μν}/∂_x__{σ}, we get in a way similar to\r\n§15, remembering that\r\n\r\n    _g__{μν} ∂_g_^{μν}/∂_x__{σ} vanishes,\r\n\r\n    the equations ∂_t__{σ}^α/∂_x__{α} - ½ ∂_g_^{μν}/∂_x__{σ} T_{μν} = 0\r\n\r\nor remembering (56)\r\n\r\n          (57) ∂T_{σ}^α/∂_x__{α} + ½ ∂_g_^{μν}/∂_x__{σ} T_{μν} = 0\r\n\r\nA comparison with (41b) shows that these equations for the above choice\r\nof co-ordinates (√(-_g_) = 1) asserts nothing but the vanishing of the\r\ndivergence of the tensor of the energy-components of matter.\r\n\r\nPhysically the appearance of the second term on the left-hand side shows\r\nthat for matter alone the law of conservation of impulse and energy\r\ncannot hold; or can only hold when _g_^{μν}’s are constants; _i.e._,\r\nwhen the field of gravitation vanishes. The second member is an\r\nexpression for impulse and energy which the gravitation-field exerts per\r\ntime and per volume upon matter. This comes out clearer when instead of\r\n(57) we write it in the form of (47).\r\n\r\n                (57a) ∂T_{σ}^α/∂_x__{α} = -Γ_{σβ}^α T_{α}^β.\r\n\r\nThe right-hand side expresses the interaction of the energy of the\r\ngravitational-field on matter. The field-equations of gravitation\r\ncontain thus at the same time 4 conditions which are to be satisfied by\r\nall material phenomena. We get the equations of the material phenomena\r\ncompletely when the latter is characterised by four other differential\r\nequations independent of one another.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      D. THE “MATERIAL” PHENOMENA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Mathematical auxiliaries developed under ‘B’ at once enables us to\r\ngeneralise, according to the generalised theory of relativity, the\r\nphysical laws of matter (Hydrodynamics, Maxwell’s Electro-dynamics) as\r\nthey lie already formulated according to the special-relativity-theory.\r\nThe generalised Relativity Principle leads us to no further limitation\r\nof possibilities; but it enables us to know exactly the influence of\r\ngravitation on all processes without the introduction of any new\r\nhypothesis.\r\n\r\nIt is owing to this, that as regards the physical nature of matter (in a\r\nnarrow sense) no definite necessary assumptions are to be introduced.\r\nThe question may lie open whether the theories of the electro-magnetic\r\nfield and the gravitational-field together, will form a sufficient basis\r\nfor the theory of matter. The general relativity postulate can teach us\r\nno new principle. But by building up the theory it must be shown whether\r\nelectro-magnetism and gravitation together can achieve what the former\r\nalone did not succeed in doing.\r\n\r\n\r\n       §19. Euler’s equations for frictionless adiabatic liquid.\r\n\r\n\r\nLet _p_ and ρ, be two scalars, of which the first denotes the pressure\r\nand the last the density of the fluid; between them there is a relation.\r\nLet the contravariant symmetrical tensor\r\n\r\n        T^{αβ} = -_g_^{αβ} _p_ + ρ  _dx__{α}/_ds_ _dx__{β}/_ds_ (58)\r\n\r\nbe the contra-variant energy-tensor of the liquid. To it also belongs\r\nthe covariant tensor\r\n\r\n    (58a) T_{μν} = -_g__{μν} _p_ + _g__{μα} _dx__{α}/_ds_ _g__{μβ}\r\n       _dx__{β}/_ds_ ρ\r\n\r\nas well as the mixed tensor\r\n\r\n    (58b) T^α_{σ} = -δ^α_{σ} _p_ + _g__{σβ} _dx__{β}/_ds_ _dx__{α}/_ds_\r\n       ρ.\r\n\r\nIf we put the right-hand side of (58b) in (57a) we get the general\r\nhydrodynamical equations of Euler according to the generalised\r\nrelativity theory. This in principle completely solves the problem of\r\nmotion; for the four equations (57a) together with the given equation\r\nbetween _p_ and ρ, and the equation\r\n\r\n                  _g__{αβ} _dx__α/_ds_ _dx__{β}/_ds_ = 1,\r\n\r\nare sufficient, with the given values of _g__{αβ}, for finding out the\r\nsix unknowns\r\n\r\n           _p_, ρ, _dx₁_/_ds_, _dx₂_/_ds_, _dx₃_/_ds_ _dx₄_/_ds_.\r\n\r\nIf _g__{μν}’s are unknown we have also to take the equations (53). There\r\nare now 11 equations for finding out 10 functions _g_, so that the\r\nnumber is more than sufficient. Now it is be noticed that the equation\r\n(57a) is already contained in (53), so that the latter only represents\r\n(7) independent equations. This indefiniteness is due to the wide\r\nfreedom in the choice of co-ordinates, so that mathematically the\r\nproblem is indefinite in the sense that three of the space-functions can\r\nbe arbitrarily chosen.\r\n\r\n\r\n            §20. Maxwell’s Electro-Magnetic field-equations.\r\n\r\n\r\nLet φ_{ν} be the components of a covariant four-vector, the\r\nelectro-magnetic potential; from it let us form according to (36) the\r\ncomponents F_{ρσ} of the covariant six-vector of the electro-magnetic\r\nfield according to the system of equations\r\n\r\n              (59) F_{ρσ} = ∂φ_{ρ}/∂_x__{σ} - ∂φ_{σ}/∂_x__{ρ}.\r\n\r\nFrom (59), it follows that the system of equations\r\n\r\n      (60) ∂F_{ρσ}/∂_x__{τ} + ∂F_{στ}/∂_x__{ρ} + ∂F_{τρ}/∂_x__{σ} = 0\r\n\r\nis satisfied of which the left-hand side, according to (37), is an\r\nanti-symmetrical tensor of the third kind. This system (60) contains\r\nessentially four equations, which can be thus written:—\r\n\r\n                    { ∂F₂₃/∂_x₄_ + ∂F₃₄/∂_x₂_ ∂F₄₂/∂_x₃_ = 0\r\n                    {\r\n                    { ∂F₃₄/∂_x₁_ + ∂F₄₁/∂_x₃_ ∂F₁₃/∂_x₄_ = 0\r\n              (60a) {\r\n                    { ∂F₄₁/∂_x₂_ + ∂F₁₂/∂_x₄_ ∂F₂₄/∂_x₁_ = 0\r\n                    {\r\n                    { ∂F₁₂/∂_x₃_ + ∂F₂₃/∂_x₁_ ∂F₃₁/∂_x₂_ = 0.\r\n\r\nThis system of equations corresponds to the second system of equations\r\nof Maxwell.

If the electrical masses be free, that is, under the\r\ninfluence of the electro-magnetic field only, then the covariant\r\nfour-vector K_{σ} will vanish.\r\n\r\nIn order to get the energy components T_{σ}^ν of the electro-magnetic\r\nfield, we require only to give to the equation K_{σ} = 0, the form of\r\nthe equation (57).\r\n\r\nFrom (63) and (65) we get first,\r\n\r\n          K_{σ} = F_{σμ} ∂F_{μν}/∂_x__{ν}\r\n\r\n          = ∂/∂_x__{ν} (F_{σμ} F^{μν}) - F^{μν} ∂F_{σμ}/∂_x__{ν}.\r\n\r\nOn account of (60) the second member on the right-hand side admits of\r\nthe transformation—\r\n\r\n            F^{μν} ∂F_{σμ}/∂_x__{ν} = -½ F^{μν} ∂F_{μν}/∂_x__{σ}\r\n\r\n            = -½ _g_^{μα} _g_^{νβ} F_{αβ} ∂F_{μν}/∂_x__{σ}.\r\n\r\nOwing to symmetry, this expression can also be written in the form\r\n\r\n             = -1/4 [_g_^{μα} _g_^{νβ} F_{αβ} ∂F_{μν}/∂_x__{σ}\r\n\r\n             + _g_^{μα} _g_^{νβ} ∂F_{αβ}/∂_x__{σ} F_{μν}],\r\n\r\nwhich can also be put in the form\r\n\r\n            - 1/4 ∂/∂_x__{σ} (_g_^{μα} _g_^{νβ} F_{αβ} F_{μν})\r\n\r\n            + 1/4 F_{αβ} F_{μν} ∂/∂_x__{σ} (_g_^{μα} _g_^{νβ}).\r\n\r\nThe first of these terms can be written shortly as\r\n\r\n                     - 1/4 ∂/∂_x__{σ} (F^{μν} F_{μν}),\r\n\r\nand the second after differentiation can be transformed in the form\r\n\r\n               - ½ F^{μτ} F_{μν} _g_^{νρ} ∂_g__{στ}/∂_x__{σ}.\r\n\r\nIf we take all the three terms together, we get the relation\r\n\r\n    (66) K_{σ} = ∂τ_{σ}^ν/∂_x__{ν} - ½ _g_^{τμ} ∂_g__{μν}/∂_x__{σ}\r\n       τ_{τ}^ν\r\n\r\nwhere\r\n\r\n        (66a)  τ_{σ}^ν = -F_{σα} F^{να} + 1/4 δ_{σ}^ν F_{αβ} F^{αβ}.\r\n\r\nOn account of (30) the equation (66) becomes equivalent to (57) and\r\n(57a) when K_{σ} vanishes. Thus τ_{σ}^ν’s are the energy-components of\r\nthe electro-magnetic field. With the help of (61) and (64) we can easily\r\nshow that the energy-components of the electro-magnetic field, in the\r\ncase of the special relativity theory, give rise to the well-known\r\nMaxwell-Poynting expressions.\r\n\r\nWe have now deduced the most general laws which the gravitation-field\r\nand matter satisfy when we use a co-ordinate system for which √(-_g_) =\r\n1. Thereby we achieve an important simplification in all our formulas\r\nand calculations, without renouncing the conditions of general\r\ncovariance, as we have obtained the equations through a specialisation\r\nof the co-ordinate system from the general covariant-equations. Still\r\nthe question is not without formal interest, whether, when the\r\nenergy-components of the gravitation-field and matter is defined in a\r\ngeneralised manner without any specialisation of co-ordinates, the laws\r\nof conservation have the form of the equation (56), and the\r\nfield-equations of gravitation hold in the form (52) or (52a); such that\r\non the left-hand side, we have a divergence in the usual sense, and on\r\nthe right-hand side, the sum of the energy-components of matter and\r\ngravitation. I have found out that this is indeed the case. But I am of\r\nopinion that the communication of my rather comprehensive work on this\r\nsubject will not pay, for nothing essentially new comes out of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n           E. §21. Newton’s theory as a first approximation.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have already mentioned several times that the special relativity\r\ntheory is to be looked upon as a special case of the general, in which\r\n_g__{μν}’s have constant values (4). This signifies, according to what\r\nhas been said before, a total neglect of the influence of gravitation.\r\nWe get one important approximation if we consider the case when\r\n_g__{μν}’s differ from (4) only by small magnitudes (compared to 1)\r\nwhere we can neglect small quantities of the second and higher orders\r\n(first aspect of the approximation.)\r\n\r\nFurther it should be assumed that within the space-time region\r\nconsidered, _g__{μν}’s at infinite distances (using the word infinite in\r\na spatial sense) can, by a suitable choice of co-ordinates, tend to the\r\nlimiting values (4); _i.e._, we consider only those gravitational fields\r\nwhich can be regarded as produced by masses distributed over finite\r\nregions.\r\n\r\nWe can assume that this approximation should lead to Newton’s theory.\r\nFor it however, it is necessary to treat the fundamental equations from\r\nanother point of view. Let us consider the motion of a particle\r\naccording to the equation (46). In the case of the special relativity\r\ntheory, the components\r\n\r\n                    _dx₁_/_ds_, _dx₂_/_ds_, _dx₃_/_ds_,\r\n\r\ncan take any values. This signifies that any velocity\r\n\r\n         _v_ = √((_dx₁_/_dx₄_)² + (_dx₂_/_dx₄_)² + (_dx₃_/_dx₄_)²)\r\n\r\ncan appear which is less than the velocity of light in vacuum (_v_ < 1).\r\nIf we finally limit ourselves to the consideration of the case when _v_\r\nis small compared to the velocity of light, it signifies that the\r\ncomponents\r\n\r\n                    _dx₁_/_ds_, _dx₂_/_ds_, _dx₃_/_ds_,\r\n\r\ncan be treated as small quantities, whereas _dx₄_/_ds_ is equal to 1, up\r\nto the second-order magnitudes (the second point of view for\r\napproximation).\r\n\r\nNow we see that, according to the first view of approximation, the\r\nmagnitudes γ_{μν}^τ’s are all small quantities of at least the first\r\norder. A glance at (46) will also show, that in this equation according\r\nto the second view of approximation, we are only to take into account\r\nthose terms for which μ = ν = 4.\r\n\r\nBy limiting ourselves only to terms of the lowest order we get instead\r\nof (46), first, the equations:—\r\n\r\n           _d²__x__{τ}/_dt²_ = Γ₄₄^τ, where _ds_ = _dx₄_ = _dt_,\r\n\r\nor by limiting ourselves only to those terms which according to the\r\nfirst stand-point are approximations of the first order,\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted, that this introduction of the energy-tensor of\r\nmatter cannot be justified by means of the Relativity-Postulate alone;\r\nfor we have in the foregoing analysis deduced it from the condition that\r\nthe energy of the gravitation-field should exert gravitating action in\r\nthe same way as every other kind of energy. The strongest ground for the\r\nchoice of the above equation however lies in this, that they lead, as\r\ntheir consequences, to equations expressing the conservation of the\r\ncomponents of total energy (the impulses and the energy) which exactly\r\ncorrespond to the equations (49) and (49a). This shall be shown\r\nafterwards.\r\n\r\n\r\n           §17. The laws of conservation in the general case.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe equations (52) can be easily so transformed that the second member\r\non the right-hand side vanishes. We reduce (52) with reference to the\r\nindices μ and σ and subtract the equation so obtained after\r\nmultiplication with ½ δ_{μ}^σ from (52).\r\n\r\nWe obtain,\r\n\r\n     (52a) ∂/∂_x__{α}(_g_^{σβ} Γ_{μβ}^α - ½ δ_{μ}^σ _g_^{λβ} Γ_{λβ}^α)\r\n     = -κ(_t__{μ}^σ + T_{μ}^σ)\r\n\r\nwe operate on it by ∂/∂_x__{σ}. Now,\r\n\r\n       ∂²/∂_x__{α}∂_x__{σ} (_g_^{σβ}Γ_{μβ}^α)\r\n       = -½ ∂²/∂_x__{α}∂_x__{σ} [_g_^{σβ} _g_^{αλ}(∂_g__{μλ}/∂_x__{β}\r\n        + ∂_g__{βλ}/∂_x__{μ} - ∂_g__{μβ}/∂_x__{λ})].\r\n\r\nThe first and the third member of the round bracket lead to expressions\r\nwhich cancel one another, as can be easily seen by interchanging the\r\nsummation-indices α, and σ, on the one hand, and β and λ, on the other.\r\n\r\nThe second term can be transformed according to (31). So that we get,\r\n\r\n                (54) ∂²/∂_x__{α}∂_x__{σ} (_g_^{σβ}γ_{μβ}^α)\r\n                 = ½ ∂³_g_^{αβ}/∂_x__{σ}∂_x__{β}∂_x__{μ}\r\n\r\nThe second member of the expression on the left-hand side of (52a) leads\r\nfirst to\r\n\r\n      - ½ ∂²/∂_x__{α}∂_x__{μ} (_g_^{λβ}Γ_{λβ}^α) or\r\n\r\n      to 1/4 ∂²/∂_x__{α}∂_x__{μ} [_g_^{λβ}_g_^{αδ}( ∂_g__{δλ}/∂_x__{β}\r\n       + ∂_g__{δβ}/∂_x__{λ} - ∂_g__{λβ}/∂_x__{δ})].\r\n\r\nThe expression arising out of the last member within the round bracket\r\nvanishes according to (29) on account of the choice of axes. The two\r\nothers can be taken together and give us on account of (31), the\r\nexpression\r\n\r\n                   -½ ∂³_g_^{αβ}/∂_x__{α}∂_x__{β}∂_x__{μ}\r\n\r\nSo that remembering (54) we have\r\n\r\n                 (55) ∂²/∂_x__{α}∂_x__{σ} (_g_^{σβ}Γ_{μβ}^α\r\n                  - ½ δ_{μ}^σ _g_^{λβ} Γ_{λβ}^α) = 0.\r\n\r\nidentically.\r\n\r\nFrom (55) and (52a) it follows that\r\n\r\n                 (56) ∂/∂_x__{σ} (_t__{μ}^σ + T_{μ}^σ) = 0\r\n\r\nFrom the field equations of gravitation, it also follows that the\r\nconservation-laws of impulse and energy are satisfied. We see it most\r\nsimply following the same reasoning which lead to equations (49a); only\r\ninstead of the energy-components of the gravitational-field, we are to\r\nintroduce the total energy-components of matter and gravitational field.\r\n\r\n\r\n     §18. The Impulse-energy law for matter as a consequence of the\r\n                            field-equations.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf we multiply (53) with ∂_g_^{μν}/∂_x__{σ}, we get in a way similar to\r\n§15, remembering that\r\n\r\n    _g__{μν} ∂_g_^{μν}/∂_x__{σ} vanishes,\r\n\r\n    the equations ∂_t__{σ}^α/∂_x__{α} - ½ ∂_g_^{μν}/∂_x__{σ} T_{μν} = 0\r\n\r\nor remembering (56)\r\n\r\n          (57) ∂T_{σ}^α/∂_x__{α} + ½ ∂_g_^{μν}/∂_x__{σ} T_{μν} = 0\r\n\r\nA comparison with (41b) shows that these equations for the above choice\r\nof co-ordinates (√(-_g_) = 1) asserts nothing but the vanishing of the\r\ndivergence of the tensor of the energy-components of matter.\r\n\r\nPhysically the appearance of the second term on the left-hand side shows\r\nthat for matter alone the law of conservation of impulse and energy\r\ncannot hold; or can only hold when _g_^{μν}’s are constants; _i.e._,\r\nwhen the field of gravitation vanishes. The second member is an\r\nexpression for impulse and energy which the gravitation-field exerts per\r\ntime and per volume upon matter. This comes out clearer when instead of\r\n(57) we write it in the form of (47).\r\n\r\n                (57a) ∂T_{σ}^α/∂_x__{α} = -Γ_{σβ}^α T_{α}^β.\r\n\r\nThe right-hand side expresses the interaction of the energy of the\r\ngravitational-field on matter. The field-equations of gravitation\r\ncontain thus at the same time 4 conditions which are to be satisfied by\r\nall material phenomena. We get the equations of the material phenomena\r\ncompletely when the latter is characterised by four other differential\r\nequations independent of one another.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      D. THE “MATERIAL” PHENOMENA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Mathematical auxiliaries developed under ‘B’ at once enables us to\r\ngeneralise, according to the generalised theory of relativity, the\r\nphysical laws of matter (Hydrodynamics, Maxwell’s Electro-dynamics) as\r\nthey lie already formulated according to the special-relativity-theory.\r\nThe generalised Relativity Principle leads us to no further limitation\r\nof possibilities; but it enables us to know exactly the influence of\r\ngravitation on all processes without the introduction of any new\r\nhypothesis.\r\n\r\nIt is owing to this, that as regards the physical nature of matter (in a\r\nnarrow sense) no definite necessary assumptions are to be introduced.\r\nThe question may lie open whether the theories of the electro-magnetic\r\nfield and the gravitational-field together, will form a sufficient basis\r\nfor the theory of matter. The general relativity postulate can teach us\r\nno new principle. But by building up the theory it must be shown whether\r\nelectro-magnetism and gravitation together can achieve what the former\r\nalone did not succeed in doing.\r\n\r\n\r\n       §19. Euler’s equations for frictionless adiabatic liquid.\r\n\r\n\r\nLet _p_ and ρ, be two scalars, of which the first denotes the pressure\r\nand the last the density of the fluid; between them there is a relation.\r\nLet the contravariant symmetrical tensor\r\n\r\n        T^{αβ} = -_g_^{αβ} _p_ + ρ  _dx__{α}/_ds_ _dx__{β}/_ds_ (58)\r\n\r\nbe the contra-variant energy-tensor of the liquid. To it also belongs\r\nthe covariant tensor\r\n\r\n    (58a) T_{μν} = -_g__{μν} _p_ + _g__{μα} _dx__{α}/_ds_ _g__{μβ}\r\n       _dx__{β}/_ds_ ρ\r\n\r\nas well as the mixed tensor\r\n\r\n    (58b) T^α_{σ} = -δ^α_{σ} _p_ + _g__{σβ} _dx__{β}/_ds_ _dx__{α}/_ds_\r\n       ρ.\r\n\r\nIf we put the right-hand side of (58b) in (57a) we get the general\r\nhydrodynamical equations of Euler according to the generalised\r\nrelativity theory. This in principle completely solves the problem of\r\nmotion; for the four equations (57a) together with the given equation\r\nbetween _p_ and ρ, and the equation\r\n\r\n                  _g__{αβ} _dx__α/_ds_ _dx__{β}/_ds_ = 1,\r\n\r\nare sufficient, with the given values of _g__{αβ}, for finding out the\r\nsix unknowns\r\n\r\n           _p_, ρ, _dx₁_/_ds_, _dx₂_/_ds_, _dx₃_/_ds_ _dx₄_/_ds_.\r\n\r\nIf _g__{μν}’s are unknown we have also to take the equations (53). There\r\nare now 11 equations for finding out 10 functions _g_, so that the\r\nnumber is more than sufficient. Now it is be noticed that the equation\r\n(57a) is already contained in (53), so that the latter only represents\r\n(7) independent equations. This indefiniteness is due to the wide\r\nfreedom in the choice of co-ordinates, so that mathematically the\r\nproblem is indefinite in the sense that three of the space-functions can\r\nbe arbitrarily chosen.\r\n\r\n\r\n            §20. Maxwell’s Electro-Magnetic field-equations.\r\n\r\n\r\nLet φ_{ν} be the components of a covariant four-vector, the\r\nelectro-magnetic potential; from it let us form according to (36) the\r\ncomponents F_{ρσ} of the covariant six-vector of the electro-magnetic\r\nfield according to the system of equations\r\n\r\n              (59) F_{ρσ} = ∂φ_{ρ}/∂_x__{σ} - ∂φ_{σ}/∂_x__{ρ}.\r\n\r\nFrom (59), it follows that the system of equations\r\n\r\n      (60) ∂F_{ρσ}/∂_x__{τ} + ∂F_{στ}/∂_x__{ρ} + ∂F_{τρ}/∂_x__{σ} = 0\r\n\r\nis satisfied of which the left-hand side, according to (37), is an\r\nanti-symmetrical tensor of the third kind. This system (60) contains\r\nessentially four equations, which can be thus written:—\r\n\r\n                    { ∂F₂₃/∂_x₄_ + ∂F₃₄/∂_x₂_ ∂F₄₂/∂_x₃_ = 0\r\n                    {\r\n                    { ∂F₃₄/∂_x₁_ + ∂F₄₁/∂_x₃_ ∂F₁₃/∂_x₄_ = 0\r\n              (60a) {\r\n                    { ∂F₄₁/∂_x₂_ + ∂F₁₂/∂_x₄_ ∂F₂₄/∂_x₁_ = 0\r\n                    {\r\n                    { ∂F₁₂/∂_x₃_ + ∂F₂₃/∂_x₁_ ∂F₃₁/∂_x₂_ = 0.\r\n\r\nThis system of equations corresponds to the second system of equations\r\nof Maxwell.

If the electrical masses be free, that is, under the\r\ninfluence of the electro-magnetic field only, then the covariant\r\nfour-vector K_{σ} will vanish.\r\n\r\nIn order to get the energy components T_{σ}^ν of the electro-magnetic\r\nfield, we require only to give to the equation K_{σ} = 0, the form of\r\nthe equation (57).\r\n\r\nFrom (63) and (65) we get first,\r\n\r\n          K_{σ} = F_{σμ} ∂F_{μν}/∂_x__{ν}\r\n\r\n          = ∂/∂_x__{ν} (F_{σμ} F^{μν}) - F^{μν} ∂F_{σμ}/∂_x__{ν}.\r\n\r\nOn account of (60) the second member on the right-hand side admits of\r\nthe transformation—\r\n\r\n            F^{μν} ∂F_{σμ}/∂_x__{ν} = -½ F^{μν} ∂F_{μν}/∂_x__{σ}\r\n\r\n            = -½ _g_^{μα} _g_^{νβ} F_{αβ} ∂F_{μν}/∂_x__{σ}.\r\n\r\nOwing to symmetry, this expression can also be written in the form\r\n\r\n             = -1/4 [_g_^{μα} _g_^{νβ} F_{αβ} ∂F_{μν}/∂_x__{σ}\r\n\r\n             + _g_^{μα} _g_^{νβ} ∂F_{αβ}/∂_x__{σ} F_{μν}],\r\n\r\nwhich can also be put in the form\r\n\r\n            - 1/4 ∂/∂_x__{σ} (_g_^{μα} _g_^{νβ} F_{αβ} F_{μν})\r\n\r\n            + 1/4 F_{αβ} F_{μν} ∂/∂_x__{σ} (_g_^{μα} _g_^{νβ}).\r\n\r\nThe first of these terms can be written shortly as\r\n\r\n                     - 1/4 ∂/∂_x__{σ} (F^{μν} F_{μν}),\r\n\r\nand the second after differentiation can be transformed in the form\r\n\r\n               - ½ F^{μτ} F_{μν} _g_^{νρ} ∂_g__{στ}/∂_x__{σ}.\r\n\r\nIf we take all the three terms together, we get the relation\r\n\r\n    (66) K_{σ} = ∂τ_{σ}^ν/∂_x__{ν} - ½ _g_^{τμ} ∂_g__{μν}/∂_x__{σ}\r\n       τ_{τ}^ν\r\n\r\nwhere\r\n\r\n        (66a)  τ_{σ}^ν = -F_{σα} F^{να} + 1/4 δ_{σ}^ν F_{αβ} F^{αβ}.\r\n\r\nOn account of (30) the equation (66) becomes equivalent to (57) and\r\n(57a) when K_{σ} vanishes. Thus τ_{σ}^ν’s are the energy-components of\r\nthe electro-magnetic field. With the help of (61) and (64) we can easily\r\nshow that the energy-components of the electro-magnetic field, in the\r\ncase of the special relativity theory, give rise to the well-known\r\nMaxwell-Poynting expressions.\r\n\r\nWe have now deduced the most general laws which the gravitation-field\r\nand matter satisfy when we use a co-ordinate system for which √(-_g_) =\r\n1. Thereby we achieve an important simplification in all our formulas\r\nand calculations, without renouncing the conditions of general\r\ncovariance, as we have obtained the equations through a specialisation\r\nof the co-ordinate system from the general covariant-equations. Still\r\nthe question is not without formal interest, whether, when the\r\nenergy-components of the gravitation-field and matter is defined in a\r\ngeneralised manner without any specialisation of co-ordinates, the laws\r\nof conservation have the form of the equation (56), and the\r\nfield-equations of gravitation hold in the form (52) or (52a); such that\r\non the left-hand side, we have a divergence in the usual sense, and on\r\nthe right-hand side, the sum of the energy-components of matter and\r\ngravitation. I have found out that this is indeed the case. But I am of\r\nopinion that the communication of my rather comprehensive work on this\r\nsubject will not pay, for nothing essentially new comes out of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n           E. §21. Newton’s theory as a first approximation.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have already mentioned several times that the special relativity\r\ntheory is to be looked upon as a special case of the general, in which\r\n_g__{μν}’s have constant values (4). This signifies, according to what\r\nhas been said before, a total neglect of the influence of gravitation.\r\nWe get one important approximation if we consider the case when\r\n_g__{μν}’s differ from (4) only by small magnitudes (compared to 1)\r\nwhere we can neglect small quantities of the second and higher orders\r\n(first aspect of the approximation.)\r\n\r\nFurther it should be assumed that within the space-time region\r\nconsidered, _g__{μν}’s at infinite distances (using the word infinite in\r\na spatial sense) can, by a suitable choice of co-ordinates, tend to the\r\nlimiting values (4); _i.e._, we consider only those gravitational fields\r\nwhich can be regarded as produced by masses distributed over finite\r\nregions.\r\n\r\nWe can assume that this approximation should lead to Newton’s theory.\r\nFor it however, it is necessary to treat the fundamental equations from\r\nanother point of view. Let us consider the motion of a particle\r\naccording to the equation (46). In the case of the special relativity\r\ntheory, the components\r\n\r\n                    _dx₁_/_ds_, _dx₂_/_ds_, _dx₃_/_ds_,\r\n\r\ncan take any values. This signifies that any velocity\r\n\r\n         _v_ = √((_dx₁_/_dx₄_)² + (_dx₂_/_dx₄_)² + (_dx₃_/_dx₄_)²)\r\n\r\ncan appear which is less than the velocity of light in vacuum (_v_ < 1).\r\nIf we finally limit ourselves to the consideration of the case when _v_\r\nis small compared to the velocity of light, it signifies that the\r\ncomponents\r\n\r\n                    _dx₁_/_ds_, _dx₂_/_ds_, _dx₃_/_ds_,\r\n\r\ncan be treated as small quantities, whereas _dx₄_/_ds_ is equal to 1, up\r\nto the second-order magnitudes (the second point of view for\r\napproximation).\r\n\r\nNow we see that, according to the first view of approximation, the\r\nmagnitudes γ_{μν}^τ’s are all small quantities of at least the first\r\norder. A glance at (46) will also show, that in this equation according\r\nto the second view of approximation, we are only to take into account\r\nthose terms for which μ = ν = 4.\r\n\r\nBy limiting ourselves only to terms of the lowest order we get instead\r\nof (46), first, the equations:—\r\n\r\n           _d²__x__{τ}/_dt²_ = Γ₄₄^τ, where _ds_ = _dx₄_ = _dt_,\r\n\r\nor by limiting ourselves only to those terms which according to the\r\nfirst stand-point are approximations of the first order,\r\n\r\n$$ \\frac{d^2 x_{\\tau}}{dt^2} = \\begin{bmatrix}44\\\\\\tau\\end{bmatrix} $$\r\n(\\tau = 1, 2, 3)\r\n\r\n$$ \\frac{d^2 x_{4}}{dt^2} = - \\begin{bmatrix}4^4\\\\4\\end{bmatrix] $$\r\n\r\nIf we further assume that the gravitation-field is quasi-static, _i.e._,\r\nit is limited only to the case when the matter producing the\r\ngravitation-field is moving slowly (relative to the velocity of light)\r\nwe can neglect the differentiations of the positional co-ordinates on\r\nthe right-hand side with respect to time, so that we get\r\n\r\n         (67) _d²__x__{τ}/_dt²_ = -½ ∂_g₄₄_/∂_x__{τ} (τ, = 1, 2, 3)\r\n\r\nThis is the equation of motion of a material point according to Newton’s\r\ntheory, where _g_₄₄/₂ plays the part of gravitational potential. The\r\nremarkable thing in the result is that in the first-approximation of\r\nmotion of the material point, only the component _g₄₄_ of the\r\nfundamental tensor appears.\r\n\r\nLet us now turn to the field-equation (53). In this case, we have to\r\nremember that the energy-tensor of matter is exclusively defined in a\r\nnarrow sense by the density ρ of matter, _i.e._, by the second member on\r\nthe right-hand side of 58 [(58a, or 58b)]. If we make the necessary\r\napproximations, then all component vanish except\r\n\r\n                                τ₄₄ = ρ = τ.\r\n\r\nOn the left-hand side of (53) the second term is an infinitesimal of the\r\nsecond order, so that the first leads to the following terms in the\r\napproximation, which are rather interesting for us:\r\n\r\n$$ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_{1}} \\begin{bmatrix}\\mu\\nu\\\\1\\end{bmatrix}\r\n+ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_{2}} \\begin{bmatrix}\\mu\\nu\\\\2\\end{bmatrix}\r\n+ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_{3}} \\begin{bmatrix}\\mu\\nu\\\\3\\end{bmatrix}\r\n+ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_{4}} \\begin{bmatrix}\\mu\\nu\\\\4\\end{bmatrix}\r\n$$\r\n\r\nBy neglecting all differentiations with regard to time, this leads, when\r\nμ = ν =4, to the expression\r\n\r\n$$ - \\frac{1}{2} ( \\frac{\\partial^2 g_{44}}{\\partial x^2_{1}} +\r\n\\frac{\\partial^2 g_{44}}{\\partial x^2_{2}} + \\frac{\\partial^2\r\ng_{44}}{\\partial x^2_{3}} ) = - \\frac{1}{2} V^2 g_{44} $$\r\n\r\nThe last of the equations (53) thus leads to\r\n\r\n                            (68) ▽² _g₄₄_ = κρ.\r\n\r\nThe equations (67) and (68) together, are equivalent to Newton’s law of\r\ngravitation.\r\n\r\nFor the gravitation-potential we get from (67) and (68) the exp.\r\n\r\n                         (68a.) -κ/(8π) ∫ ρ_d_τ/_r_\r\n\r\nwhereas the Newtonian theory for the chosen unit of time gives\r\n\r\n                            -K/_c²_ ∫ρ_d_τ/_r_,\r\n\r\nwhere K denotes usually the gravitation-constant. 6.7 x 10⁻⁸; equating\r\nthem we get\r\n\r\n                     (69) κ = 8πK/_c²_ = 1.87 x 10⁻²⁷.\r\n\r\n\r\n       §22. Behaviour of measuring rods and clocks in a statical\r\n  gravitation-field. Curvature of light-rays. Perihelion-motion of the\r\n                         paths of the Planets.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to obtain Newton’s theory as a first approximation we had to\r\ncalculate only _g₄₄_, out of the 10 components _g__{μν} of the\r\ngravitation-potential, for that is the only component which comes in the\r\nfirst approximate equations of motion of a material point in a\r\ngravitational field.\r\n\r\nWe see however, that the other components of _g__{μν} should also differ\r\nfrom the values given in (4) as required by the condition _g_ = -1.\r\n\r\nFor a heavy particle at the origin of co-ordinates and generating the\r\ngravitational field, we get as a first approximation the symmetrical\r\nsolution of the equation:—\r\n\r\n         { _g__{ρσ} = -δ_{ρσ} - α(_x__{ρ} _x__{σ})/_r³_ (ρ and σ 1, 2,\r\n            3)\r\n         {\r\n    (70) { _g__{ρ4} = _g__{4ρ} = 0    (ρ 1, 2, 3)\r\n         {\r\n         { _g₄₄_ = 1 - α/_r_.\r\n\r\nδ_{ρσ} is 1 or 0, according as ρ = σ or not and _r_ is the quantity\r\n\r\n                         +√(_x₁²_ + _x₂²_ + _x₃²_).\r\n\r\nOn account of (68a) we have\r\n\r\n                              (70a) α = κM/4π\r\n\r\nwhere M denotes the mass generating the field. It is easy to verify that\r\nthis solution satisfies approximately the field-equation outside the\r\nmass M.\r\n\r\nLet us now investigate the influences which the field of mass M will\r\nhave upon the metrical properties of the field. Between the lengths and\r\ntimes measured locally on the one hand, and the differences in\r\nco-ordinates _dx__{ν} on the other, we have the relation\r\n\r\n                    _ds²_ = _g__{μν} _dx__{μ} _dx__{ν}.\r\n\r\nFor a unit measuring rod, for example, placed parallel to the _x_ axis,\r\nwe have to put\r\n\r\n                   _ds²_ = -1, _dx₂_ = _dx₃_ = _dx₄_ = 0\r\n\r\n                   then          -1 = _g_₁₁_dx₁²_.\r\n\r\nIf the unit measuring rod lies on the _x_ axis, the first of the\r\nequations (70) gives\r\n\r\n                           _g₁₁_ = -(1 + α/_r_).\r\n\r\nFrom both these relations it follows as a first approximation that\r\n\r\n                          (71) _dx_ = 1 - α/2_r_.\r\n\r\nThe unit measuring rod appears, when referred to the co-ordinate-system,\r\nshortened by the calculated magnitude through the presence of the\r\ngravitational field, when we place it radially in the field.\r\n\r\nSimilarly we can get its co-ordinate-length in a tangential position, if\r\nwe put for example\r\n\r\n     _ds²_ = -1, _dx₁_ = _dx₃_ = _dx₄_ = 0, _x₁_ = _r_, _x₂_ = _x₃_ = 0\r\n\r\nwe then get\r\n\r\n                     (71a) -1 = _g₂₂_ _dx₂²_ = -_dx₂²_.\r\n\r\nThe gravitational field has no influence upon the length of the rod,\r\nwhen we put it tangentially in the field.\r\n\r\nThus Euclidean geometry does not hold in the gravitational field even in\r\nthe first approximation, if we conceive that one and the same rod\r\nindependent of its position and its orientation can serve as the measure\r\nof the same extension. But a glance at (70a) and (69) shows that the\r\nexpected difference is much too small to be noticeable in the\r\nmeasurement of earth’s surface.\r\n\r\nWe would further investigate the rate of going of a unit-clock which is\r\nplaced in a statical gravitational field. Here we have for a period of\r\nthe clock\r\n\r\n                     _ds_ = 1, _dx₁_ = _dx₂_ _dx₃_ = 0;\r\n\r\nthen we have\r\n\r\n       1 = _g₄₄__dx₄²_\r\n\r\n       _dx₄_ = 1/√(_g_₄₄) = 1/√(1 + (_g_₄₄ - 1)) = 1 - (_g_₄₄ - 1)/2\r\n\r\n       or _dx₄_ = 1 + _k_/8π ∫ ρ_d_τ/_r_.\r\n\r\nTherefore the clock goes slowly what it is placed in the neighbourhood\r\nof ponderable masses. It follows from this that the spectral lines in\r\nthe light coming to us from the surfaces of big stars should appear\r\nshifted towards the red end of the spectrum.\r\n\r\nLet us further investigate the path of light-rays in a statical\r\ngravitational field. According to the special relativity theory, the\r\nvelocity of light is given by the equation\r\n\r\n                  -_dx₁²_ - _dx₂²_ - _dx₃²_ + _dx₄²_ = 0;\r\n\r\nthus also according to the generalised relativity theory it is given by\r\nthe equation\r\n\r\n                (73) _ds²_ = _g__{μν} _dx__{μ} _dx__{ν} = 0.\r\n\r\nIf the direction, _i.e._, the ratio _dx₁_ : _dx₂_ : _dx₃_ is given, the\r\nequation (73) gives the magnitudes\r\n\r\n                   _dx₁_/_dx₄_, _dx₂_/_dx₄_, _dx₃_/_dx₄_,\r\n\r\nand with it the velocity,\r\n\r\n          √((_dx₁_/_dx₄_)² + (_dx₂_/_dx₄_)² + (_dx₃_/_dx₄_)²) = γ,\r\n\r\nin the sense of the Euclidean Geometry. We can easily see that, with\r\nreference to the co-ordinate system, the rays of light must appear\r\ncurved in case _g__{μν}’s are not constants. If _n_ be the direction\r\nperpendicular to the direction of propagation, we have, from Huygen’s\r\nprinciple, that light-rays (taken in the plane (γ, _n_)] must suffer a\r\ncurvature ∂λ/∂_n_.\r\n\r\nLet us find out the curvature which a light-ray suffers when it goes by\r\na mass M at a distance Δ from it. If we use the co-ordinate system\r\naccording to the above scheme, then the total bending B of light-rays\r\n(reckoned positive when it is concave to the origin) is given as a\r\nsufficient approximation by\r\n\r\n                       B = ∫_{-∞}^∞ ∂γ/∂[_x_]₁ _dx₂_\r\n\r\nwhere (73) and (70) gives\r\n\r\n             γ = √(-_g₄₄_/_g₂₂_) = 1 - α/2_r_ (1 + _x₂²_/_r²_).\r\n\r\nThe calculation gives\r\n\r\n                             B = 2α/Δ = KM/2πΔ.\r\n\r\nA ray of light just grazing the sun would suffer a bending of 1·7″,\r\nwhereas one coming by Jupiter would have a deviation of about ·02″.\r\n\r\nIf we calculate the gravitation-field to a greater order of\r\napproximation and with it the corresponding path of a material particle\r\nof a relatively small (infinitesimal) mass we get a deviation of the\r\nfollowing kind from the Kepler-Newtonian Laws of Planetary motion. The\r\nEllipse of Planetary motion suffers a slow rotation in the direction of\r\nmotion, of amount\r\n\r\n            (75) _s_ = 24π³_a²_/τ²_c²_(1 - _e²_) per revolution.\r\n\r\nIn this Formula ‘_a_’ signifies the semi-major axis, _c_, the velocity\r\nof light, measured in the usual way, _e_, the eccentricity, τ, the time\r\nof revolution in seconds.\r\n\r\nThe calculation gives for the planet Mercury, a rotation of path of\r\namount 43″ per century, corresponding sufficiently to what has been\r\nfound by astronomers (Leverrier). They found a residual perihelion\r\nmotion of this planet of the given magnitude which can not be explained\r\nby the perturbation of the other planets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 NOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Note 1.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fundamental electro-magnetic equations of Maxwell for stationary\r\nmedia are:—\r\n\r\n                     curl H = 1/_c_ (∂D/∂_t_ + ρν) (1)\r\n\r\n                     curl E = -1/_c_ ∂B/∂_t_ (2)\r\n\r\n                     div D = ρ\r\n                     B = μH\r\n                     div B = 0\r\n                     D = kE\r\n\r\nAccording to Hertz and Heaviside, these require modification in the case\r\nof moving bodies.\r\n\r\nNow it is known that due to motion alone there is a change in a vector\r\n_R_ given by\r\n\r\n            (∂_R_/∂_t_) due to motion = _u_. div R + curl [_Ru_]\r\n\r\nwhere _u_ is the vector velocity of the moving body and [R_u_] the\r\nvector product of R and _u_.\r\n\r\nHence equations (1) and (2) become\r\n\r\n      _c_ curl H = ∂D/∂_t_ + _u_ div D + curl Vect.

Now at a point which\r\nis fixed with respect to the ether, the rate of change of electric\r\npolarisation is δD/δ_t_.\r\n\r\nConsider a slab of matter moving with velocity _u__{_x_} along the\r\n_x_-axis, then even in a stationary field of electrostatic polarisation,\r\nthat is, for a field in which δD/δ_t_ = 0, there will be some change in\r\nthe polarisation of the body due to its motion, given by\r\n_u__{_x_}(δD/δ_x_). Hence we must add this term to a purely temporal\r\nrate of change δD/δ_t_. Doing this we immediately arrive at equations\r\n(1·21) and (2·21) for the special case considered there.\r\n\r\nThus the Hertz-Heaviside form of field equations gives _unity_ as the\r\nvalue for the Fresnelian convection co-efficient. It has been shown in\r\nthe historical introduction how this is entirely at variance with the\r\nobserved optical facts. As a matter of fact, Larmor has shown (Aether\r\nand Matter) that 1 - 1/μ² is not only sufficient but is also necessary,\r\nin order to explain experiments of the Arago prism type.\r\n\r\nA short summary of the electromagnetic experiments bearing on this\r\nquestion, has already been given in the introduction.\r\n\r\nAccording to Hertz and Heaviside the total polarisation is situated in\r\nthe medium itself and is completely carried away by it. Thus the\r\nelectromagnetic effect outside a moving medium should be proportional to\r\nK, the specific inductive capacity.\r\n\r\n_Rowland_ showed in 1876 that when a charged condenser is rapidly\r\nrotated (the dielectric remaining stationary), the magnetic effect\r\noutside is proportional to K, the Sp. Ind. Cap.\r\n\r\n_Röntgen_ (Annalen der Physik 1888, 1890) found that if the dielectric\r\nis rotated while the condenser remains stationary, the effect is\r\nproportional to K - 1.\r\n\r\n_Eichenwald_ (Annalen der Physik 1903, 1904) rotated together both\r\ncondenser and dielectric and found that the magnetic effect was\r\nproportional to the potential difference and to the angular velocity,\r\nbut was completely independent of K. This is of course quite consistent\r\nwith Rowland and Röntgen.\r\n\r\n_Blondlot_ (Comptes Rendus, 1901) passed a current of air in a steady\r\nmagnetic field H_{_y_}, (H = H_{_z_} = 0). If this current of air moves\r\nwith velocity _u__{_x_} along the _x_-axis, an electromotive force would\r\nbe set up along the _z_-axis, due to the relative motion of matter and\r\nmagnetic tubes of induction. A pair of plates at _z_ = ±_a_, will be\r\ncharged up with density ρ = D_{_z_} = KE = K. _u__{_s_} H_{_y_}/c. But\r\nBlondlot failed to detect any such effect.\r\n\r\n_H. A. Wilson_ (Phil. Trans. Royal Soc. 1904) repeated the experiment\r\nwith a cylindrical condenser made of ebony, rotating in a magnetic field\r\nparallel to its own axis. He observed a change proportional to K — 1 and\r\nnot to K.\r\n\r\nThus the above set of electro-magnetic experiments contradict the\r\nHertz-Heaviside equations, and these must be abandoned.\r\n\r\n[P.

Theory of Electrons (English edition), pages 197-200, 230, also\r\nnotes 73, 86, pages 318, 328.\r\n\r\nLorentz wanted to explain the Michelson-Morley null-effect. In order to\r\ndo so, it was obviously necessary to explain the Fitzgerald contraction.\r\nLorentz worked on the hypothesis that an electron itself undergoes\r\ncontraction when moving. He introduced new variables for the moving\r\nsystem defined by the following set of equations.\r\n\r\n    _x¹_ = β(_x_ - _ut_), _y¹_ = _y_, _z¹_ = _z_, _t¹_ = β(_t_ -\r\n       (_u_/_c²_)·_x_)\r\n\r\nand for velocities, used\r\n\r\n    _v__{_x_}¹ = β²_v__{_x_} + _u_, _v__{_y_}¹ = β_v__{_y_}, _v__{_z_}¹\r\n       = β_v__{_z_} and ρ¹ = ρ/β.\r\n\r\nWith the help of the above set of equations, which is known as the\r\nLorentz transformation, he succeeded in showing how the Fitzgerald\r\ncontraction results as a consequence of “fortuitous compensation of\r\nopposing effects.”\r\n\r\nIt should be observed that the Lorentz transformation is not identical\r\nwith the Einstein transformation. The Einsteinian addition of velocities\r\nis quite different as also the expression for the “relative” density of\r\nelectricity.\r\n\r\nIt is true that the Maxwell-Lorentz field equations remain _practically_\r\nunchanged by the Lorentz transformation, but they _are_ changed to some\r\nslight extent. One marked advantage of the Einstein transformation\r\nconsists in the fact that the field equations of a moving system\r\npreserve _exactly_ the same form as those of a stationary system.\r\n\r\nIt should also be noted that the Fresnelian convection coefficient comes\r\nout in the theory of relativity as a direct consequence of Einstein’s\r\naddition of velocities and is quite independent of any electrical theory\r\nof matter.\r\n\r\n[P.

Thus the electromagnetic laws of Maxwell and Lorentz\r\n_can be definitely proved_ “to be independent of the manner in which\r\nthey are referred to two coordinate systems which have a uniform\r\ntranslatory motion relative to each other.” (See “Electrodynamics of\r\nMoving Bodies,” page 5.) Thus so far as the electromagnetic laws are\r\nconcerned, the principle of relativity _can be proved to be true_.\r\n\r\nBut it is not known whether this principle will remain true in the case\r\nof other physical laws. We can always proceed on the assumption that it\r\ndoes remain true. Thus it is always possible to construct physical laws\r\nin such a way that they retain their form when referred to moving\r\ncoordinates. The ultimate ground for formulating physical laws in this\r\nway is merely a subjective conviction that the principle of relativity\r\nis universally true. There is no _a priori_ logical necessity that it\r\nshould be so. Hence the Principle of Relativity (so far as it is applied\r\nto phenomena other than electromagnetic) must be regarded as a\r\n_postulate_, which we have assumed to be true, but for which we cannot\r\nadduce any definite proof, until after the generalisation is made and\r\nits consequences tested in the light of actual experience.\r\n\r\n[P.

It follows that even if a radiant source S move\r\nwith a velocity _u_, it should always remain the centre of spherical\r\nwaves expanding outwards with velocity _c_.\r\n\r\nAt first sight, it may not appear clear why the velocity should remain\r\nconstant. Indeed according to the theory of Ritz, the velocity should\r\nbecome _c_ + _u_, when the source of light moves towards the observer\r\nwith the velocity _u_.\r\n\r\nProf. de Sitter has given an astronomical argument for deciding between\r\nthese two divergent views. Let us suppose there is a double star of\r\nwhich one is revolving about the common centre of gravity in a circular\r\norbit. Let the observer be in the plane of the orbit, at a great\r\ndistance Δ.\r\n\r\n[Illustration.]\r\n\r\nThe light emitted by the star when at the position A will be received by\r\nthe observer after a time, Δ/(_c_ + _u_) while the light emitted by the\r\nstar when at the position B will be received after a time Δ/(_c_ - _u_).\r\nLet T be the real half-period of the star. Then the observed half-period\r\nfrom B to A is approximately T - 2Δ_u_/_c²_ and from A to B is T +\r\n2Δ_u_/_c²_. Now if 2_u_Δ/_c²_ be comparable to T, then it is impossible\r\nthat the observations should satisfy Kepler’s Law. In most of the\r\nspectroscopic binary stars, 2_u_Δ/_c²_ are not only of the same order as\r\nT, but are mostly much larger. For example, if _u_ = 100 _km_/sec, T = 8\r\ndays, Δ/_c_ = 33 years (corresponding to an annual parallax of ·1″),\r\nthen T - 2_u_Δ/_c²_ = 0. The existence of the Spectroscopic binaries,\r\nand the fact that they follow Kepler’s Law is therefore a proof that _c_\r\nis not affected by the motion of the source.\r\n\r\nIn a later memoir, replying to the criticisms of Freundlich and Günthick\r\nthat an apparent eccentricity occurs in the motion proportional to\r\n_ku_Δ₀, _u₀_ being the maximum value of _u_, the velocity of light\r\nemitted being\r\n\r\n                          _u₀_ = _c_ + _ku_,\r\n                          _k_ = 0 Lorentz-Einstein\r\n                          _k_ = 1 Ritz.\r\n\r\nProf. de Sitter admits the validity of the criticisms. But he remarks\r\nthat an upper value of _k_ may be calculated from the observations of\r\nthe double star β-Aurigae. For this star, the parallax π = ·014″, _e_ =\r\n·005, _u₀_ = 110 _km_/sec, T = 3·96,\r\n\r\n                            Δ > 65 light-years,\r\n                            _k_ is < ·002.\r\n\r\nFor an experimental proof, see a paper by C.

Instead of Minkowski’s space-time vector\r\nof the first kind, he uses the more expressive term ‘four-vector,’\r\nthereby making it quite clear that it represents a directed quantity\r\nlike a straight line, a force or a momentum, and has got 4 components,\r\nthree in the direction of space-axes, and one in the direction of the\r\ntime-axis.\r\n\r\nThe representation of the plane (defined by two straight lines) is much\r\nmore difficult. In three dimensions, the plane can be represented by the\r\nvector perpendicular to itself. But that artifice is not available in\r\nfour dimensions. For the perpendicular to a plane, we now have not a\r\nsingle line, but an infinite number of lines constituting a plane. This\r\ndifficulty has been overcome by Minkowski in a very elegant manner which\r\nwill become clear later on. Meanwhile we offer the following extract\r\nfrom the above mentioned work of Sommerfeld.\r\n\r\n(Pp. 755, Bd. 32, Ann. d. Physik.)\r\n\r\n“In order to have a better knowledge about the nature of the six-vector\r\n(which is the same thing as Minkowski’s space-time vector of the _2nd_\r\nkind) let us take the special case of a piece of plane, having unit area\r\n(contents), and the form of a parallelogram, bounded by the four-vectors\r\n_u_, _v_, passing through the origin. Then the projection of this piece\r\nof plane on the _xy_ plane is given by the projections _u__{_x_},\r\n_u__{_y_}, _v__{_x_}, _v__{_y_} of the four vectors in the combination\r\n\r\n           φ_{_x_ _y_} = _u__{_x_}_v__{_y_} - _u__{_y_}_v_{_x_}.\r\n\r\nLet us form in a similar manner all the six components of this plane φ.\r\nThen six components are not all independent but are connected by the\r\nfollowing relation\r\n\r\n    φ_{_y_ _z_} φ_{_x_ _l_} + φ_{_z_ _x_} φ_{_y_ _l_} + φ_{_x_ _y_}\r\n       φ_{_z_ _l_} = 0\r\n\r\nFurther the contents | φ | of the piece of a plane is to be defined as\r\nthe square root of the sum of the squares of these six quantities. In\r\nfact,\r\n\r\n    | φ |² = φ_{_y_ _z_}² + φ_{_z_ _x_}² + φ_{_x_ _y_}² + φ_{_x_ _l_}² +\r\n       φ_{_y_ _l_}² + φ_{_z_ _l_}².\r\n\r\nLet us now on the other hand take the case of the unit plane φ^* normal\r\nto φ; we can call this plane the Complement of φ. Then we have the\r\nfollowing relations between the components of the two plane:—\r\n\r\n    φ_{_y_ _z_}^* = φ_{_x_ _l_}, φ_{_z_ _x_}^* = φ_{_y_ _l_}, φ_{_x_\r\n       _y_}^* = φ_{_z_ _l_} φ_{_z_ _l_}^* = φ_{_y_ _x_} ...\r\n\r\nThe proof of these assertions is as follows. Let _u_^*, _v_^* be the\r\nfour vectors defining φ^*.

We shall\r\nnow see the consequences of admitting a velocity W > _c_.\r\n\r\nLet A and B be separated by distance _l_, and let velocity of a “signal”\r\nin the system S be W > _c_. Let the (observing) system S′ have velocity\r\n+_v_ with respect to the system S.\r\n\r\nThen velocity of signal with respect to system S′ is given by W′ = (W -\r\n_v_)/(1 - W_v_/_c²_)\r\n\r\nThus “time” from A to B as measured in S′, is given by _l_/W′ = _l_(1 -\r\nW_v_/_c²_)/(W - _v_) = _t′_ (1)\r\n\r\nNow if _v_ is less than _c_, then W being greater than _c_ (by\r\nhypothesis) W is greater than _v_, _i.e._, W > _v_.\r\n\r\nLet W = _c_ + μ and _v_ = _c_ - λ.\r\n\r\nThen W_v_ = (_c_ + μ)(_c_ - λ) = _c²_ + (μ + λ)_c_ - μλ.\r\n\r\nNow we can always choose _v_ in such a way that W_v_ is greater than\r\n_c²_, since W_v_ is > _c²_ if (μ + λ)_c_ - μλ is > 0, that is, if μ + λ\r\n> μλ/_c_; which can always be satisfied by a suitable choice of λ.\r\n\r\nThus for W > _c_ we can always choose λ in such a way as to make W_v_ >\r\n_c²_, _i.e._, λ - W_v_/_c²_ negative. But W - _v_ is always positive.\r\nHence with W > _c_, we can always make _t′_, the time from A to B in\r\nequation (1) “negative.” That is, the signal starting from A will reach\r\nB (as observed in system S′) in less than no time. Thus the effect will\r\nbe perceived before the cause commences to act, _i.e._, the future will\r\nprecede the past. Which is absurd. Hence we conclude that W > _c_ is an\r\nimpossibility, there can be no velocity greater than that of light.\r\n\r\nIt is _conceptually_ possible to imagine velocities greater than that of\r\nlight, but such velocities cannot occur in reality. Velocities greater\r\nthan _c_, will not produce any effect. Causal effect of any physical\r\ntype can never travel with a velocity greater than that of light.\r\n\r\n[P. C.

(P. 36).\r\n\r\n\r\nThis represents the vector product of a four-vector and a six-vector.\r\nNow as combinations of this type are of frequent occurrence in this\r\npaper, it will be better to form an idea of their geometrical meaning.\r\nThe following is taken from the above mentioned paper of Sommerfeld.\r\n\r\n“We can also form a vectorial combination of a four-vector and a\r\nsix-vector, giving us a vector of the third type. If the six-vector be\r\nof a special type, _i.e._, a piece of plane, then this vector of the\r\nthird type denotes the parallelopiped formed of this four-vector and\r\nthe complement of this piece of plane. In the general case, the\r\nproduct will be the geometric sum of two parallelopipeds, but it can\r\nalways be represented by a four-vector of the 1st type. For two pieces\r\nof 3-space volumes can always be added together by the vectorial\r\naddition of their components. So by the addition of two 3-space\r\nvolumes, we do not obtain a vector of a more general type, but one\r\nwhich can always be represented by a four-vector (loc. cit. p. 759).\r\nThe state of affairs here is the same as in the ordinary vector\r\ncalculus, where by the vector-multiplication of a vector of the first,\r\nand a vector of the second type (_i.e._, a polar vector), we obtain a\r\nvector of the first type (axial vector). The formal scheme of this\r\nmultiplication is taken from the three-dimensional case.\r\n\r\nLet A = (A_{_x_}, A_{_y_}, A_{_z_}) denote a vector of the first type, B\r\n= (B_{_y z_}, B_{_z x_}, B_{_x y_}) denote a vector of the second type.\r\nFrom this last, let us form three special vectors of the first kind,\r\nnamely—\r\n\r\n    B_{_x_} = (B_{_x x_}, B_{_x y_}, B_{_x z_}) }\r\n    B_{_y_} = (B_{_y x_}, B_{_y y_}, B_{_y z_}) } (B_{_i k_} = - B_{_k\r\n       i_}, B_{_i i_} = 0).\r\n    B_{_z_} = (B_{_z x_}, B_{_z y_}, B_{_z z_}) }\r\n\r\nSince B_{_j j_} is zero, B_{_j_} is perpendicular to the _j_-axis. The\r\n_j_-component of the vector-product of A and B is equivalent to the\r\nscalar product of A and B_{_j_}, _i.e._,\r\n\r\n    (A B_{_j_},) = A_{_x_} B_{_j x_} + A_{_y_} B_{_j y_} + A_{_z_} B_{_j\r\n       z_}.\r\n\r\nWe see easily that this coincides with the usual rule for the\r\nvector-product; _e. g._, for _j_ = _x_.\r\n\r\n          (AB_{_x_}) = A_{_y_} B_{_x_ _y_} - A_{_z_} B_{_z_ _x_}.\r\n\r\nCorrespondingly let us define in the four-dimensional case the product\r\n(P_f_) of any four-vector P and the six-vector _f_. The _j_-component\r\n(_j_ = _x_, _y_, _z_, or _l_) is given by\r\n\r\n    (P_f__{_j_}) = P_{_x_}_f__{_j_ _x_} + P_{_y_}_f__{_j_ _y_} +\r\n       P_{_w_}_f__{_j_ _z_} + P_{_z_}_f__{_j_ _l_}\r\n\r\nEach one of these components is obtained as the scalar product of P, and\r\nthe vector _f__{_j_} which is perpendicular to j-axis, and is obtained\r\nfrom _f_ by the rule _f__{_j_} = [(_f__{_j_ _x_}, _f__{_j_ _y_},\r\n_f__{_j_ _z_}, _f__{_j_ _l_}) _f__{_j_ _j_} = 0.]\r\n\r\nWe can also find out here the geometrical significance of vectors of the\r\nthird type, when _f_ = φ, _i.e._, _f_ represents only one plane.\r\n\r\nWe replace φ by the parallelogram defined by the two four-vectors U, V,\r\nand let us pass over to the conjugate plane φ^*, which is formed by the\r\nperpendicular four-vectors U^*, V^*.

Lorentz, the discoverer of the theorem of relativity.\r\nLater writers have sometimes used the symbol □ to denote this operation.\r\nIn the above-mentioned paper (Annalen der Physik, p. 649, Bd. 38)\r\nSommerfeld has introduced the terms, Div (divergence), Rot (Rotation),\r\nGrad (gradient) as four-dimensional extensions of the corresponding\r\nthree-dimensional operations in place of the general symbol lor. The\r\nphysical significance of these operations will become clear when along\r\nwith Minkowski’s method of treatment we also study the geometrical\r\nmethod of Sommerfeld. Minkowski begins here with the case of lor S,\r\nwhere S is a six-vector (space-time vector of the 2nd kind).\r\n\r\nThis being a complicated case, we take the simpler case of lor _s_,\r\n\r\nwhere _s_ is a four-vector = | _s₁_, _s₂_, _s₃_, _s₄_ |\r\n\r\n                           and    _s_ = | _s₁_ |\r\n                                        | _s₂_ |\r\n                                        | _s₃_ |\r\n                                        | _s₄_ |\r\n\r\nThe following geometrical method is taken from Sommerfeld.\r\n\r\nScalar Divergence—Let ΔΣ denote a small four-dimensional volume of any\r\nshape in the neighbourhood of the space-time point Q, _d_S denote the\r\nthree-dimensional bounding surface of ΔΣ, _n_ be the outer normal to\r\n_d_S. Let S be any four-vector, P_{_n_} its normal component. Then\r\n\r\n                       Div S = Lim ∫ P_{_n_}_d_S/ΔΣ.\r\n                           ΔΣ = 0\r\n\r\nNow if for ΔΣ we choose the four-dimensional parallelopiped with sides\r\n(_dx₁_, _dx₂_, _dx₃_, _dx₄_), we have then\r\n\r\n    Div S = ∂_s₁_/∂_x₁_ + ∂_s₂_/∂_x₂_ + ∂_s₃_/∂_x₃_ + ∂_s₄_/∂_x₄_ = lor\r\n       S.\r\n\r\nIf _f_ denotes a space-time vector of the second kind, lor _f_ is\r\nequivalent to a space-time vector of the first kind. The geometrical\r\nsignificance can be thus brought out. We have seen that the operator\r\n‘lor’ behaves in every respect like a four-vector. The vector-product of\r\na four-vector and a six-vector is again a four-vector. Therefore it is\r\neasy to see that lor S will be a four-vector. Let us find the component\r\nof this four-vector in any direction _s_. Let S denote the three-space\r\nwhich passes through the point Q (_x₁_, _x₂_, _x₃_, _x₄_) and is\r\nperpendicular to _s_, ΔS a very small part of it in the region of Q,\r\n_d_σ is an element of its two-dimensional surface. Let the perpendicular\r\nto this surface lying in the space be denoted by _n_, and let _f__{_s_\r\n_n_} denote the component of _f_ in the plane of (_sn_) which is\r\nevidently conjugate to the plane _d_σ. Then the _s_-component of the\r\nvector divergence of _f_ because the operator lor multiplies _f_\r\nvectorially.\r\n\r\n              = Div _f__{_s_} = Lim (∫ _f__{_s_ _n_}_d_σ)/ΔS.\r\n                  Δ_s_ = 0\r\n\r\nWhere the integration in _d_σ is to be extended over the whole surface.\r\n\r\nIf now _s_ is selected as the _x_-direction, Δ_s_ is then a\r\nthree-dimensional parallelopiped with the sides _dy_, _dz_, _dl_, then\r\nwe have\r\n\r\n$$ Div f_{x} = \\frac{1}{dy dz dl} {dz. dl. \\frac{\\partial\r\nf_{xy}}{\\partial y} dy + dl dy \\frac{\\partial f_{xy}}{\\partial z} dz +\r\ndy dz \\frac{\\partial f_{xy}}{\\partial l} dl} = \\frac{\\partial\r\nf_{xy}}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial f_{xy}}{\\partial z} +\r\n\\frac{\\partial f_{xy}}{\\partial l} $$\r\n\r\nand generally\r\n\r\n    Div _f__{_j_} = ∂_f__{_j_ _x_}/∂_x_ + ∂_f__{_j_ _y_}/∂_y_ +\r\n       ∂_f__{_j_ _z_}/∂_z_ + ∂_f__{_j_ _l_}/∂_l_ (where _f__{_j_, _j_} =\r\n       0).\r\n\r\nHence the four-components of the four-vector lor S or Div. _f_ is a\r\nfour-vector with the components given on page 42.\r\n\r\nAccording to the formulae of space geometry, D_{_x_} denotes a\r\nparallelopiped laid in the (_y_-_z_-_l_) space, formed out of the\r\nvectors (P_{_y_} P_{_z_} P_{_l_}), (U_{_y_}^* U_{_z_}^* U_{_l_}^*)\r\n(V_{_y_}^* V_{_z_}^* V_{_l_}^*).\r\n\r\nD_{_x_} is therefore the projection on the _y-z-l_ space of the\r\nparallelopiped formed out of these three four-vectors (P, U^*, V^*), and\r\ncould as well be denoted by Dyzl. We see directly that the four-vector\r\nof the kind represented by (D_{_x_}, D_{_y_}, D_{_z_}, D_{_l_}) is\r\nperpendicular to the parallelopiped formed by (P U^* V^*).\r\n\r\nGenerally we have\r\n\r\n                           (P_f_) = PD + P^*D^*.\r\n\r\n∴ The vector of the third type represented by (P_f_) is given by the\r\ngeometrical sum of the two four-vectors of the first type PD and P^*D^*.\r\n\r\n[M.
