We ask--who is\r\nsufficient for these things? What life is long enough--what intellect\r\nstrong enough, to master even a tithe of the learning which all these\r\nbooks contain? But the reflection comes to our aid that, after all, the\r\nreally important books bear but a small proportion to the mass. Most\r\nbooks are but repetitions, in a different form, of what has already been\r\nmany times written and printed. The rarest of literary qualities is\r\noriginality. Most writers are mere echoes, and the greater part of\r\nliterature is the pouring out of one bottle into another. If you can get\r\nhold of the few really best books, you can well afford to be ignorant of\r\nall the rest. The reader who has mastered Kames's \"Elements of\r\nCriticism,\" need not spend his time over the multitudinous treatises upon\r\nrhetoric. He who has read Plutarch's Lives thoroughly has before him a\r\ngallery of heroes which will go farther to instruct him in the elements\r\nof character than a whole library of modern biographies. The student of\r\nthe best plays of Shakespeare may save his time by letting other and\r\ninferior dramatists alone. He whose imagination has been fed upon Homer,\r\nDante, Milton, Burns, and Tennyson, with a few of the world's\r\nmaster-pieces in single poems like Gray's Elegy, may dispense with the\r\nwhole race of poetasters. Until you have read the best fictions of\r\nScott, Thackeray, Dickens, Hawthorne, George Eliot, and Victor Hugo, you\r\nshould not be hungry after the last new novel,--sure to be forgotten in a\r\nyear, while the former are perennial. The taste which is once formed upon\r\nmodels such as have been named, will not be satisfied with the trashy\r\nbook, or the spasmodic school of writing.\r\n\r\nWhat kind of books should form the predominant part in the selection of\r\nour reading, is a question admitting of widely differing opinions. Rigid\r\nutilitarians may hold that only books of fact, of history and science,\r\nworks crammed full of knowledge, should be encouraged. Others will plead\r\nin behalf of lighter reading, or for a universal range. It must be\r\nadmitted that the most attractive reading to the mass of people is not\r\nscientific or philosophical. But there are many very attractive books\r\noutside the field of science, and outside the realm of fiction, books\r\ncapable of yielding pleasure as well as instruction. There are few books\r\nthat render a more substantial benefit to readers of any age than good\r\nbiographies. In them we find those personal experiences and adventures,\r\nthose traits of character, that environment of social and domestic life,\r\nwhich form the chief interest in works of fiction. In fact, the novel, in\r\nits best estate, is only biography amplified by imagination, and\r\nenlivened by dialogue. And the novel is successful only when it succeeds\r\nin depicting the most truly the scenes, circumstances, and characters of\r\nreal life. A well written biography, like that of Dr. Johnson, by\r\nBoswell, Walter Scott, by Lockhart, or Charles Dickens, by Forster, gives\r\nthe reader an insight into the history of the times they lived in, the\r\nsocial, political, and literary environment, and the impress of their\r\nfamous writings upon their contemporaries. In the autobiography of Dr.\r\nFranklin, one of the most charming narratives ever written, we are taken\r\ninto the writer's confidence, sympathize with his early struggles,\r\nmistakes, and successes, and learn how he made himself, from a poor boy\r\nselling ballads on Boston streets, into a leader among men, whom two\r\nworlds have delighted to honor. Another most interesting book of\r\nbiography is that of the brothers William and Robert Chambers, the famous\r\npublishers of Edinburgh, who did more to diffuse useful knowledge, and to\r\neducate the people, by their manifold cheap issues of improving and\r\nentertaining literature, than was ever done by the British Useful\r\nKnowledge Society itself.\r\n\r\nThe French nation has, of all others, the greatest genius for personal\r\nmemoirs, and the past two centuries are brought far more vividly before\r\nus in these free-spoken and often amusing chronicles, than in all the\r\nformal histories. Among the most readable of these (comparatively few\r\nhaving been translated into English) are the Memoirs of Marmontel,\r\nRousseau, Madame Rémusat, Amiel, and Madame De Staël. The recently\r\npublished memoirs by Imbert de St. Amand, of court life in France in the\r\ntimes of Marie Antoinette, Josephine, Marie Louise, and other periods,\r\nwhile hastily written and not always accurate, are lively and\r\nentertaining.\r\n\r\nThe English people fall far behind the French in biographic skill, and\r\nmany of their memoirs are as heavy and dull as the persons whom they\r\ncommemorate. But there are bright exceptions, in the lives of literary\r\nmen and women, and in some of those of noted public men in church and\r\nstate. Thus, there are few books more enjoyable than Sydney Smith's\r\nMemoirs and Letters, or Greville's Journals covering the period including\r\nGeorge IV to Victoria, or the Life and Letters of Macaulay, or Mrs.\r\nGaskell's Charlotte Brontë, or the memoirs of Harriet Martineau, or\r\nBoswell's Life of Dr. Johnson. Among the briefer biographies worthy of\r\nspecial mention are the series of English Men of Letters, edited by John\r\nMorley, and written by some of the best of contemporary British writers.\r\nThey embrace memoirs of Chaucer, Spenser, Bacon, Sidney, Milton, De Foe,\r\nSwift, Sterne, Fielding, Locke, Dryden, Pope, Johnson, Gray, Addison,\r\nGoldsmith, Burke, Hume, Gibbon, Bunyan, Bentley, Sheridan, Burns, Cowper,\r\nSouthey, Scott, Byron, Lamb, Coleridge, Keats, Shelley, Wordsworth, De\r\nQuincey, Macaulay, Landor, Dickens, Thackeray, Hawthorne, and Carlyle.\r\nThese biographies, being quite compendious, and in the main very well\r\nwritten, afford to busy readers a short-hand method of acquainting\r\nthemselves with most of the notable writers of Britain, their personal\r\ncharacteristics, their relation to their contemporaries, and the quality\r\nand influence of their works. Americans have not as yet illustrated the\r\nfield of biographic literature by many notably skilful examples. We are\r\nespecially deficient in good autobiographies, so that Dr. Franklin's\r\nstands almost alone in singular merit in that class. We have an abundance\r\nof lives of notable generals, professional men, and politicians, in which\r\nindiscriminate eulogy and partisanship too often usurp the place of\r\nactual facts, and the truth of history is distorted to glorify the merits\r\nof the subject of the biography. The great success of General Grant's own\r\nMemoirs, too, has led publishers to tempt many public men in military or\r\ncivil life, into the field of personal memoirs, not as yet with\r\ndistinguished success.\r\n\r\nIt were to be wished that more writers possessed of some literary skill,\r\nwho have borne a part in the wonderful drama involving men and events\r\nenacted in this country during the century now drawing to a close, had\r\ngiven us their sincere personal impressions in autobiographic form. Such\r\nnarratives, in proportion as they are truthful, are far more trustworthy\r\nthan history written long after the event by authors who were neither\r\nobservers nor participants in the scenes which they describe.\r\n\r\nAmong American biographies which will help the reader to gain a tolerably\r\nwide acquaintance with the men and affairs of the past century in this\r\ncountry, are the series of Lives of American Statesmen, of which thirty\r\nvolumes have been published. These include Washington, the Adamses,\r\nJefferson, Franklin, Hamilton, Jay, Madison, Marshall, Monroe, Henry,\r\nGallatin, Morris, Randolph, Jackson, Van Buren, Webster, Clay, Calhoun,\r\nCass, Benton, Seward, Lincoln, Chase, Stevens, and Sumner. While these\r\nMemoirs are of very unequal merit, they are sufficiently instructive to\r\nbe valuable to all students of our national history.\r\n\r\nAnother very useful series is that of American Men of Letters, edited by\r\nCharles Dudley Warner, in fifteen volumes, which already includes\r\nFranklin, Bryant, Cooper, Irving, Noah Webster, Simms, Poe, Emerson,\r\nRipley, Margaret Fuller, Willis, Thoreau, Taylor, and Curtis.\r\n\r\nIn the department of history, the best books for learners are not always\r\nthe most famous. Any mere synopsis of universal history is necessarily\r\ndry reading, but for a constant help in reference, guiding one to the\r\nbest original sources, under each country, and with very readable\r\nextracts from the best writers treating on each period, the late work of\r\nJ. N. Larned, \"History for Ready Reference,\" five volumes, will be found\r\ninvaluable. Brewer's Historic Note Book, in a single volume, answers many\r\nhistoric queries in a single glance at the alphabet. For the History of\r\nthe United States, either John Fiske's or Eggleston's is an excellent\r\ncompend, while for the fullest treatment, Bancroft's covers the period\r\nfrom the discovery of America up to the adoption of the constitution in\r\n1789, in a style at once full, classical, and picturesque. For\r\ncontinuations, McMaster's History of the People of the United States\r\ncovers the period from 1789 to 1824, and is being continued. James\r\nSchouler has written a History of the United States from 1789 to 1861, in\r\nfive volumes, while J. F. Rhodes ably covers the years 1850 to the Civil\r\nWar with a much more copious narrative.\r\n\r\nFor the annals of England, the Short History of England by J. R. Green is\r\na most excellent compend. For more elaborate works, the histories of Hume\r\nand Macaulay bring the story of the British Empire down to about 1700.\r\nFor the more modern period, Lecky's History of England in the 18th\r\ncentury is excellent, and for the present century, McCarthy's History of\r\nOur Own Time, and Miss Martineau's History of England, 1815-52, are well\r\nwritten works. French history is briefly treated in the Student's History\r\nof France, while Guizot's complete History, in eight volumes, gives a\r\nmuch fuller account, from the beginnings of France in the Roman period,\r\nto the year 1848. Carlyle's French Revolution is a splendid picture of\r\nthat wonderful epoch, and Sloane's History of Napoleon gives very full\r\ndetails of the later period.\r\n\r\nFor the history of Germany, Austria, Russia, France, Spain, Italy,\r\nHolland, and other countries, the various works in the \"Story of the\r\nNations\" series, are excellent brief histories.\r\n\r\nMotley's Rise of the Dutch Republic and his United Netherlands are highly\r\nimportant and well written historical works.\r\n\r\nThe annals of the ancient world are elaborately and ably set forth in\r\nGrote's History of Greece, Merivale's Rome, and Gibbon's Decline and Fall\r\nof the Roman Empire.\r\n\r\nAnother class of books closely allied to biography and history, is the\r\ncorrespondence of public men, and men of letters, with friends and\r\ncontemporaries. These familiar letters frequently give us views of\r\nsocial, public, and professional life which are of absorbing interest.\r\nAmong the best letters of this class may be reckoned the correspondence\r\nof Horace Walpole, Madame de Sévigné, the poets Gray and Cowper, Lord\r\nMacaulay, Lord Byron, and Charles Dickens. Written for the most part with\r\nunstudied ease and unreserve, they entertain the reader with constant\r\nvariety of incident and character, while at the same time they throw\r\ninnumerable side-lights upon the society and the history of the time.\r\n\r\nNext, we may come to the master-pieces of the essay-writers. You will\r\noften find that the best treatise on any subject is the briefest, because\r\nthe writer is put upon condensation and pointed statement, by the very\r\nform and limitations of the essay, or the review or magazine article.\r\nBook-writers are apt to be diffuse and episodical, having so extensive a\r\ncanvas to cover with their literary designs. Among the finest of the\r\nessayists are Montaigne, Lord Bacon, Addison, Goldsmith, Macaulay, Sir\r\nJames Stephen, Cardinal Newman, De Quincey, Charles Lamb, Washington\r\nIrving, Emerson, Froude, Lowell, and Oliver Wendell Holmes. You may spend\r\nmany a delightful hour in the perusal of any one of these authors.\r\n\r\nWe come now to poetry, which some people consider very unsubstantial\r\npabulum, but which forms one of the most precious and inspiring portions\r\nof the literature of the world. In all ages, the true poet has exercised\r\nan influence upon men's minds that is unsurpassed by that of any other\r\nclass of writers. And the reason is not far to seek. Poetry deals with\r\nthe highest thoughts, in the most expressive language. It gives utterance\r\nto all the sentiments and passions of humanity in rhythmic and harmonious\r\nverse. The poet's lines are remembered long after the finest compositions\r\nof the writers of prose are forgotten. They fasten themselves in the\r\nmemory by the very flow and cadence of the verse, and they minister to\r\nthat sense of melody that dwells in every human brain. What the world\r\nowes to its great poets can never be fully measured. But some faint idea\r\nof it may be gained from the wondrous stimulus given through them to the\r\nimaginative power, and from the fact that those sentiments of human\r\nsympathy, justice, virtue, and freedom, which inspire the best poetry of\r\nall nations, become sooner or later incarnated in their institutions.\r\nThis is the real significance of the oft-quoted saying of Andrew\r\nFletcher, that stout Scotch republican of two centuries ago, that if one\r\nwere permitted to make all the ballads of a nation, he need not care who\r\nshould make the laws.\r\n\r\nIn the best poetry, the felicity of its expressions of thought, joined\r\nwith their rhythmical form, makes it easy for the reader to lay up almost\r\nunconsciously a store in the memory of the noblest poetic sentiments, to\r\ncomfort or to divert him in many a weary or troubled hour. Hence time is\r\nwell spent in reading over and over again the great poems of the world.\r\nFar better and wiser is this, than to waste it upon the newest trash that\r\ncaptivates the popular fancy, for the last will only tickle the\r\nintellectual palate for an hour, or a day, and be then forgotten, while\r\nthe former will make one better and wiser for all time.\r\n\r\nNor need one seek to read the works of very many writers in order to fill\r\nhis mind with images of truth and beauty which will dwell with him\r\nforever. The really great poets in the English tongue may be counted upon\r\nthe fingers. Shakespeare fitly heads the list--a world's classic,\r\nunsurpassed for reach of imagination, variety of scenes and characters,\r\nprofound insight, ideal power, lofty eloquence, moral purpose, the most\r\nmoving pathos, alternating with the finest humor, and diction unequalled\r\nfor strength and beauty of expression. Milton, too, in his minor poems,\r\nhas given us some of the noblest verse in the language. There is poetry\r\nenough in his L'Allegro and Il Penseroso to furnish forth a whole galaxy\r\nof poets.\r\n\r\nSpenser and Pope, Gray and Campbell, Goldsmith and Burns, Wordsworth and\r\nthe Brownings, Tennyson and Longfellow,--these are among the other\r\nforemost names in the catalogue of poets which none can afford to\r\nneglect. Add to these the best translations of Homer, Virgil, Horace,\r\nDante, and Goethe, and one need not want for intellectual company and\r\nsolace in youth or age.\r\n\r\nAmong the books which combine entertainment with information, the best\r\nnarratives of travellers and voyagers hold an eminent place. In them the\r\nreader enlarges the bounds of his horizon, and travels in companionship\r\nwith his author all over the globe. While many, if not the most, of the\r\nbooks of modern travellers are filled with petty incidents and personal\r\nobservations of no importance, there are some wonderfully good books of\r\nthis attractive class. Such are Kinglake's \"Eothen, or traces of travel\r\nin the East,\" Helen Hunt Jackson's \"Bits of Travel,\" a volume of keen and\r\namusing sketches of German and French experiences, the books of De Amicus\r\non Holland, Constantinople, and Paris, those on England by Emerson,\r\nHawthorne, William Winter, and Richard Grant White, Curtis's Nile Notes,\r\nHowell's \"Venetian Life,\" and Taine's \"Italy, Rome and Naples.\"\r\n\r\nThe wide domain of science can be but cursorily touched upon. Many\r\nreaders get so thorough a distaste for science in early life--mainly from\r\nthe fearfully and wonderfully dry text-books in which our schools and\r\ncolleges have abounded--that they never open a scientific book in later\r\nyears. This is a profound mistake, since no one can afford to remain\r\nignorant of the world in which we live, with its myriad wonders, its\r\ninexhaustible beauties, and its unsolved problems. And there are now\r\nworks produced in every department of scientific research which give in a\r\npopular and often in a fascinating style, the revelations of nature which\r\nhave come through the study and investigation of man. Such books are \"The\r\nStars and the Earth,\" Kingsley's \"Glaucus, or Wonders of the Shore,\"\r\nClodd's \"Story of Creation,\" (a clear account of the evolution theory)\r\nFiguier's \"Vegetable World,\" and Professor Langley's \"New Astronomy.\"\r\nThere are wise specialists whose published labors have illuminated for\r\nthe uninformed reader every nook and province of the mysteries of\r\ncreation, from the wing of a beetle to the orbits of the planetary\r\nworlds. There are few pursuits more fascinating than those that bring us\r\nacquainted with the secrets of nature, whether dragged up from the depths\r\nof the sea, or demonstrated in the substance and garniture of the green\r\nearth, or wrung from the far-off worlds in the shining heavens.\r\n\r\nA word only can be spared to the wide and attractive realm of fiction. In\r\nthis field, those are the best books which have longest kept their hold\r\nupon the public mind. It is a wise plan to neglect the novels of the\r\nyear, and to read (or to re-read in many cases) the master-pieces which\r\nhave stood the test of time, and criticism, and changing fashions, by the\r\nsure verdict of a call for continually new editions. Ouida and Trilby may\r\nendure for a day, but Thackeray and Walter Scott are perennial. It is\r\nbetter to read a fine old book through three times, than to read three\r\nnew books through once.\r\n\r\nOf books more especially devoted to the history of literature, in times\r\nancient and modern, and in various nations, the name is legion. I count\r\nup, of histories of English literature alone (leaving out the American)\r\nno less than one hundred and thirty authors on this great field or some\r\nportion of it. To know what ones of these to study, and what to leave\r\nalone, would require critical judgment and time not at my command. I can\r\nonly suggest a few known by me to be good. For a succinct yet most\r\nskilfully written summary of English writers, there is no book that can\r\ncompare with Stopford A. Brooke's Primer of English Literature. For more\r\nfull and detailed treatment, Taine's History of English Literature, or\r\nChambers' Cyclopaedia of English Literature, two volumes, with specimens\r\nof the writers of every period, are the best. E. C. Stedman's Victorian\r\nPoets is admirable, as is also his Poets of America. For a bird's eye\r\nview of American authors and their works, C. F. Richardson's Primer of\r\nAmerican Literature can be studied to advantage, while for more full\r\nreference to our authors, with specimens of each, Stedman's Library of\r\nAmerican Literature in eleven volumes, should be consulted. M. C. Tyler's\r\nvery interesting critical History of the Early American Literature, so\r\nlittle known, comes down in its fourth volume only to the close of the\r\nrevolution in 1783.\r\n\r\nFor classical literature, the importance of a good general knowledge of\r\nwhich can hardly be overrated, J. P. Mahaffy's History of Greek\r\nLiterature, two volumes, and G. A. Simcox's Latin Literature, two\r\nvolumes, may be commended. On the literature of modern languages, to\r\nrefer only to works written in English, Saintsbury's Primer of French\r\nLiterature is good, and R. Garnett's History of Italian Literature is\r\nadmirable (by the former Keeper of Printed Books in the British Museum\r\nLibrary). Lublin's Primer of German Literature is excellent for a\r\ncondensed survey of the writers of Germany, while W. Scherer's History of\r\nGerman Literature, two volumes, covers a far wider field. For Spanish\r\nLiterature in its full extent, there is no work at all equal to George\r\nTicknor's three volumes, but for a briefer history, H. B. Clark's\r\nHand-book of Spanish Literature, London, 1893, may be used.\r\n\r\nI make no allusion here to the many works of reference in the form of\r\ncatalogues and bibliographical works, which may be hereafter noted. My\r\naim has been only to indicate the best and latest treatises covering the\r\nleading literatures of the world, having no space for the Scandinavian,\r\nDutch, Portuguese, Russian, or any of the Slavonic or oriental tongues.\r\n\r\nThose who find no time for studying the more extended works named, will\r\nfind much profit in devoting their hours to the articles in the\r\nEncyclopaedia Britannica upon the literatures of the various countries.\r\nThese are within reach of everyone.\r\n\r\nThe select list of books named in this chapter does not by any means aim\r\nto cover those which are well worth reading; but only to indicate a few,\r\na very few, of the best. It is based on the supposition that intelligent\r\nreaders will give far less time to fiction than to the more solid food of\r\nhistory, biography, essays, travels, literary history, and applied\r\nscience. The select list of books in the fields already named is designed\r\nto include only the most improving and well-executed works. Many will not\r\nfind their favorites in the list, which is purposely kept within narrow\r\nlimits, as a suggestion only of a few of the best books for a home\r\nlibrary or for general reading. You will find it wise to own, as early in\r\nlife as possible, a few of the choicest productions of the great writers\r\nof the world. Those who can afford only a selection from a selection, can\r\nbegin with never so few of the authors most desired, or which they have\r\nnot already, putting in practice the advice of Shakespeare:\r\n\r\n    \"In brief, sir, study what you most affect.\"\r\n\r\nSays John Ruskin: \"I would urge upon every young man to obtain as soon\r\nas he can, by the severest economy, a restricted and steadily increasing\r\nseries of books, for use through life; making his little library, of all\r\nhis furniture, the most studied and decorative piece.\" And Henry Ward\r\nBeecher urged it as the most important early ambition for clerks, working\r\nmen and women, and all who are struggling up in life, to form gradually a\r\nlibrary of good books. \"It is a man's duty,\" says he, \"to have books. A\r\nlibrary is not a luxury, but one of the necessaries of life.\"\r\n\r\nAnd says Bishop Hurst, urging the vital importance of wise selection in\r\nchoosing our reading: \"If two-thirds of the shelves of the typical\r\ndomestic library were emptied of their burden, and choice books put in\r\ntheir stead, there would be reformation in intelligence and thought\r\nthroughout the civilized world.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSELECTION OF BOOKS FOR PUBLIC LIBRARIES.\r\n\r\nLet us now consider the subject of books fitted for public libraries. At\r\nthe outset, it is most important that each selection should be made on a\r\nwell considered plan. No hap-hazard, or fitfully, or hastily made\r\ncollection can answer the two ends constantly to be aimed at--namely,\r\nfirst, to select the best and most useful books, and, secondly, to\r\neconomize the funds of the library. No money should be wasted upon whims\r\nand experiments, but every dollar should be devoted to the acquisition of\r\nimproving books.\r\n\r\nAs to the principles that should govern and the limitations to be laid\r\ndown, these will depend much upon the scope of the library, and the\r\namount of its funds. No library of the limited and moderate class\r\ncommonly found in our public town libraries can afford to aim at the\r\nuniversal range of a national library, nor even at the broad selections\r\nproper to a liberally endowed city library.\r\n\r\nBut its aims, while modest, should be comprehensive enough to provide a\r\ncomplete selection of what may be termed standard literature, for the\r\nreading public. If the funds are inadequate to do this in the beginning,\r\nit should be kept constantly in view, as the months and years go on.\r\nEvery great and notable book should be in the library sooner or later,\r\nand if possible at its foundation. Thus will its utility and\r\nattractiveness both be well secured.\r\n\r\nTaking first the case of a small public library about to be started, let\r\nus see in a few leading outlines what it will need.\r\n\r\n1. A selection of the best works of reference should be the corner-stone\r\nof every library collection. In choosing these, regard must be had to\r\nsecure the latest as well as the best. Never buy the first edition of\r\nSoule's Synonymes because it is cheap, but insist upon the revised and\r\nenlarged edition of 1892. Never acquire an antiquated Lempriere's or\r\nAnthon's Classical Dictionary, because some venerable library director,\r\nwho used it in his boyhood, suggests it, when you can get Professor H. T.\r\nPeck's \"Dictionary of Classical Antiquities,\" published in 1897. Never be\r\ntempted to buy an old edition of an encyclopaedia at half or quarter\r\nprice, for it will be sure to lack the populations of the last census,\r\nbesides being a quarter of a century or more in arrears in its other\r\ninformation. When consulting sale catalogues to select reference books,\r\nlook closely at the dates of publication, and make sure by your American\r\nor English catalogues that no later edition has appeared. It goes without\r\nsaying that you will have these essential bibliographies, as well as\r\nLowndes' Manual of English Literature first of all, whether you are able\r\nto buy Watt and Brunet or not.\r\n\r\n2. Without here stopping to treat of books of reference in detail, which\r\nwill appear in another place, let me refer to some other great classes\r\nof literature in which every library should be strong. History stands\r\nfairly at the head, and while a newly established library cannot hope to\r\npossess at once all the noted writers, it should begin by securing a fine\r\nselection, embracing general history, ancient and modern, and the history\r\nof each country, at least of the important nations. For compendious short\r\nhistories, the \"Story of the Nations\" series, by various writers, should\r\nbe secured, and the more extensive works of Gibbon, Grote, Mommsen,\r\nDuruy, Fyffe, Green, Macaulay, Froude, McCarthy, Carlyle, Thiers,\r\nBancroft, Motley, Prescott, Fiske, Schouler, McMaster, Buckle, Guizot,\r\netc., should be acquired. The copious lists of historical works appended\r\nto Larned's \"History for Ready Reference\" will be useful here.\r\n\r\n3. Biography stands close to history in interest and importance. For\r\ngeneral reference, or the biography of all nations, Lippincott's\r\nUniversal Pronouncing Dictionary of Biography is essential, as well as\r\nAppleton's Cyclopaedia of American Biography, for our own country. For\r\nGreat Britain, the \"Dictionary of National Biography\" is a mine of\r\ninformation, and should be added if funds are sufficient. Certain sets of\r\ncollective biographies which are important are American Statesmen, 26\r\nvols., Englishmen of Letters, -- vols., Autobiography, 33 vols., Famous\r\nWomen series, 21 vols., Heroes of the Nation series, 24 vols., American\r\nPioneers and Patriots, 12 vols., and Plutarch's Lives. Then of\r\nindispensable single biographies there are Boswell's Johnson, Lockhart's\r\nScott, Froude's Carlyle, Trevelyan's Macaulay, Froude's Caesar, Lewes'\r\nGoethe, etc.\r\n\r\n4. Of notable essays, a high class of literature in which there are many\r\nnames, may be named Addison, Montaigne, Bacon, Goldsmith, Emerson, Lamb,\r\nDe Quincey, Holmes, Lowell, etc.\r\n\r\n5. Poetry stands at the head of all the literature of imagination. Some\r\npeople of highly utilitarian views decry poetry, and desire to feed all\r\nreaders upon facts. But that this is a great mistake will be apparent\r\nwhen we consider that the highest expressions of moral and intellectual\r\ntruth and the most finely wrought examples of literature in every nation\r\nare in poetic form. Take out of the world's literature the works of its\r\ngreat poets, and you would leave it poor indeed. Poetry is the only great\r\nsource for the nurture of imagination, and without imagination man is a\r\npoor creature. I read the other day a dictum of a certain writer,\r\nalleging that Dickens's Christmas Carol is far more effective as a piece\r\nof writing than Milton's noble ode \"On the Morning of Christ's Nativity.\"\r\nSuch comparisons are of small value. In point of fact, no library can\r\nspare either of them. I need not repeat the familiar names of the great\r\npoets; they are found in all styles of production, and some of the best\r\nare among the least expensive.\r\n\r\n6. Travels and voyages form a very entertaining as well as highly\r\ninstructive part of a library. A good selection of the more notable will\r\nprove a valuable resource to readers of nearly every age.\r\n\r\n7. The wide field of science should be carefully gleaned for a good range\r\nof approved text-books in each department. So progressive is the modern\r\nworld that the latest books are apt to be the best in each science,\r\nsomething which is by no means true in literature.\r\n\r\n8. In law, medicine, theology, political science, sociology, economics,\r\nart, architecture, music, eloquence, and language, the library should be\r\nprovided with the leading modern works.\r\n\r\n9. We come now to fiction, which the experience of all libraries shows is\r\nthe favorite pabulum of about three readers out of four. The great demand\r\nfor this class of reading renders it all the more important to make a\r\nwise and improving selection of that which forms the minds of multitudes,\r\nand especially of the young. This selection presents to every librarian\r\nand library director or trustee some perplexing problems. To buy\r\nindiscriminately the new novels of the day, good, bad, and indifferent\r\n(the last named greatly predominating) would be a very poor discharge of\r\nthe duty devolving upon those who are the responsible choosers of the\r\nreading of any community. Conceding, as we must, the vast influence and\r\nuntold value of fiction as a vehicle of entertainment and instruction,\r\nthe question arises--where can the line be drawn between the good and\r\nimproving novels, and novels which are neither good nor improving? This\r\ninvolves something more than the moral tone and influence of the\r\nfictions: it involves their merits and demerits as literature also. I\r\nhold it to be the bounden duty of those who select the reading of a\r\ncommunity to maintain a standard of good taste, as well as of good\r\nmorals. They have no business to fill the library with wretched models of\r\nwriting, when there are thousand of good models ready, in numbers far\r\ngreater than they have money to purchase. Weak and flabby and silly books\r\ntend to make weak and flabby and silly brains. Why should library guides\r\nput in circulation such stuff as the dime novels, or \"Old Sleuth\"\r\nstories, or the slip-slop novels of \"The Duchess,\" when the great masters\r\nof romantic fiction have endowed us with so many books replete with\r\nintellectual and moral power? To furnish immature minds with the\r\nmiserable trash which does not deserve the name of literature, is as\r\nblameworthy as to put before them books full of feverish excitement, or\r\nstories of successful crime.\r\n\r\nWe are told, indeed (and some librarians even have said it) that for\r\nunformed readers to read a bad book is better than to read none at all.\r\nI do not believe it. You might as well say that it is better for one to\r\nswallow poison than not to swallow any thing at all. I hold that library\r\nproviders are as much bound to furnish wholesome food for the minds of\r\nthe young who resort to them for guidance, as their parents are to\r\nprovide wholesome food for their bodies.\r\n\r\nBut the question returns upon us--what is wholesome food? In the first\r\nplace, it is that great body of fiction which has borne the test, both of\r\ncritical judgment, and of popularity with successive generations of\r\nreaders. It is the novels of Scott, Austen, Dickens, Thackeray, George\r\nEliot, Cooper, Hawthorne, Kingsley, Mulock-Craik, and many more, such as\r\nno parents need blush to put into the hands of their daughters. In the\r\nnext place, it is such a selection from the myriads of stories that have\r\npoured from the press of this generation as have been approved by the\r\nbest readers, and the critical judgment of a responsible press.\r\n\r\nAs to books of questionable morality, I am aware that contrary opinions\r\nprevail on the question whether any such books should be allowed in a\r\npublic library, or not. The question is a different one for the small\r\ntown libraries and for the great reference libraries of the world. The\r\nformer are really educational institutions, supported at the people's\r\nexpense, like the free schools, and should be held to a responsibility\r\nfrom which the extensive reference libraries in the city are free. The\r\nlatter may and ought to preserve every form of literature, and, if\r\nnational libraries, they would be derelict in their duty to posterity if\r\nthey did not acquire and preserve the whole literature of the country,\r\nand hand it down complete to future generations. The function of the\r\npublic town library is different. It must indispensably make a selection,\r\nsince its means are not adequate to buy one-tenth of the annual product\r\nof the press, which amounts in only four nations (England, France,\r\nGermany, and the United States) to more than thirty-five thousand new\r\nvolumes a year. Its selection, mainly of American and English books, must\r\nbe small, and the smaller it is, the greater is the need of care in\r\nbuying. In fact, it is in most cases, compelled to be a selection from a\r\nselection. Therefore, in the many cases of doubt arising as to the fit\r\ncharacter of a book, let the doubt be resolved in favor of the fund, thus\r\npreserving the chance of getting a better book for the money.\r\n\r\nWith this careful and limited selection of the best, out of the multitude\r\nof novels that swarm from the press, the reading public will have every\r\nreason to be satisfied. No excuse can be alleged for filling up our\r\nlibraries with poor books, while there is no dearth whatever of good\r\nones. It is not the business of a public library to compete with the news\r\nstands or the daily press in furnishing the latest short stories for\r\npopular consumption; a class of literature whose survival is likely to be\r\nquite as short as the stories themselves.\r\n\r\nTake an object lesson as to the mischiefs of reading the wretched stuff\r\nwhich some people pretend is \"better than no reading at all\" from the boy\r\nJesse Pomeroy, who perpetrated a murder of peculiar atrocity in Boston.\r\n\"Pomeroy confessed that he had always been a great reader of 'blood and\r\nthunder' stories, having read probably sixty dime novels, all treating of\r\nscalping and deeds of violence. The boy said that he had no doubt that\r\nthe reading of those books had a great deal to do with his course, and he\r\nwould advise all boys to leave them alone.\"\r\n\r\nIn some libraries, where the pernicious effect of the lower class of\r\nfiction has been observed, the directors have withdrawn from circulation\r\na large proportion of the novels, which had been bought by reason of\r\ntheir popularity. In other newly started libraries only fiction of the\r\nhighest grade has been placed in the library from the start, and this is\r\nby far the best course. If readers inquire for inferior or immoral books,\r\nand are told that the library does not have them, although they will\r\nexpress surprise and disappointment, they will take other and improving\r\nreading, thus fulfilling the true function of the library as an educator.\r\nLibrarians and library boards cannot be too careful about what\r\nconstitutes the collection which is to form the pabulum of so many of the\r\nrising generation.\r\n\r\nThis does not imply that they are to be censors, or prudes, but with the\r\nvast field of literature before them from which to choose, they are bound\r\nto choose the best.\r\n\r\nThe American Library Association has had this subject under discussion\r\nrepeatedly, and while much difference of opinion has arisen from the\r\ndifficulty of finding any absolute standard of excellence, nearly all\r\nhave agreed that as to certain books, readers should look elsewhere than\r\nto the public free library for them. At one time a list of authors was\r\nmade out, many of whose works were deemed objectionable, either from\r\ntheir highly sensational character, or their bad style, or their highly\r\nwrought and morbid pictures of human passions, or their immoral tendency.\r\nThis list no doubt will surprise many, as including writers whose books\r\neverybody, almost, has read, or has been accustomed to think well of. It\r\nembraces the following popular authors, many of whose novels have had a\r\nwide circulation, and that principally through popular libraries.\r\n\r\nHere follow the names:\r\n\r\nMary J. Holmes, Mrs. Henry Wood, C. L. Hentz, M. P. Finley, Mrs. A. S.\r\nStephens, E. D. E. N. Southworth, Mrs. Forrester, Rhoda Broughton, Helen\r\nMathers, Jessie Fothergill, M. E. Braddon, Florence Marryat, Ouida,\r\nHoratio Alger, Mayne Reid, Oliver Optic, W. H. S. Kingston, E. Kellogg,\r\nG. W. M. Reynolds, C. Fosdick, Edmund Yates, G. A. Lawrence, Grenville\r\nMurray, W. H. Ainsworth, Wilkie Collins, E. L. Bulwer-Lytton, W. H.\r\nThomes, and Augusta Evans Wilson.\r\n\r\nBear in mind, that only English and American novels are included, and\r\nthose only of the present century: also, that as to many which are\r\nincluded, no imputation of immorality was made. Such a \"black list\" is\r\nobviously open to the charge of doing great injustice to the good repute\r\nof writers named, since only a part of the works written by some of them\r\ncan properly be objected to, and these are not specially named.\r\nBulwer-Lytton, for example, whose \"Paul Clifford\" is a very improper book\r\nto go into the hands of young people, has written at least a dozen other\r\nfictions of noble moral purpose, and high literary merit.\r\n\r\nOut of seventy public libraries to which the list was sent, with inquiry\r\nwhether the authors named were admitted as books of circulation, thirty\r\nlibraries replied. All of them admitted Bulwer-Lytton and Wilkie Collins,\r\nall but two Oliver Optic's books, and all but six Augusta Evans Wilson's.\r\nReynolds' novels were excluded by twenty libraries, Mrs. Southworth's by\r\neleven, \"Ouida's\" by nine, and Mrs. Stephens's and Mrs. Henry Wood's by\r\neight. Other details cannot find space for notice here.\r\n\r\nThis instance is one among many of endeavors constantly being made by\r\nassociated librarians to stem the ever increasing flood of poor fiction\r\nwhich threatens to submerge the better class of books in our public\r\nlibraries.\r\n\r\nThat no such wholesome attempt can be wholly successful is evident\r\nenough. The passion for reading fiction is both epidemic and chronic; and\r\nin saying this, do not infer that I reckon it as a disease. A librarian\r\nhas no right to banish fiction because the appetite for it is abused. He\r\nis not to set up any ideal and impossible standard of selection. His\r\nmost useful and beneficent function is to turn into better channels the\r\nuniversal hunger for reading which is entertaining. Do readers want an\r\nexciting novel? What can be more exciting than \"Les Miserables\" of Victor\r\nHugo, a book of exceptional literary excellence and power? Literature is\r\nfull of fascinating stories, admirably told, and there is no excuse for\r\nloading our libraries with trash, going into the slums for models, or\r\nfeeding young minds upon the unclean brood of pessimistic novels. If it\r\nis said that people will have trash, let them buy it, and let the\r\nlibraries wash their hands of it, and refuse to circulate the stuff which\r\nno boy nor girl can touch without being contaminated.\r\n\r\nThose who claim that we might as well let the libraries down to the level\r\nof the poorest books, because unformed and ignorant minds are capable of\r\nnothing better, should be told that people are never raised by giving\r\nthem nothing to look up to. To devour infinite trash is not the road to\r\nlearn wisdom, or virtue, or even to attain genuine amusement. To those\r\nwho are afraid that if the libraries are purified, the masses will get\r\nnothing that they can read, the answer is, have they not got the entire\r\nworld of magazines, the weekly, daily, and Sunday newspapers, which\r\nsupply a whole library of fiction almost daily? Add to these plenty of\r\nimaginative literature in fiction and in poetry, on every library's\r\nshelves, which all who can read can comprehend, and what excuse remains\r\nfor buying what is neither decent nor improving?\r\n\r\nTake an example of the boundless capacity for improvement that exists in\r\nthe human mind and human taste, from the spread of the fine arts among\r\nthe people. Thirty years ago, their houses, if having any decoration at\r\nall, exhibited those fearful and wonderful colored lithographs and\r\nchromos in which bad drawing, bad portraiture, and bad coloring vied with\r\neach other to produce pictures which it would be a mild use of terms to\r\ncall detestable. Then came the two great international art expositions at\r\nPhiladelphia and Chicago, each greatly advancing by the finest models,\r\nthe standard of taste in art, and by new economies of reproduction\r\nplacing the most beautiful statues and pictures within the reach of the\r\nmost moderate purse. What has been the result? An incalculable\r\nimprovement in the public taste, educated by the diffusion of the best\r\nmodels, until even the poor farmer of the backwoods will no longer\r\ntolerate the cheap and nasty horrors that once disfigured his walls.\r\n\r\nThe lesson in art is good in literature also. Give the common people good\r\nmodels, and there is no danger but they will appreciate and understand\r\nthem. Never stoop to pander to a depraved taste, no matter what specious\r\npleas you may hear for tolerating the low in order to lead to the high,\r\nor for making your library contribute to the survival of the unfittest.\r\n\r\nIs it asked, how can the librarian find out, among the world of novels\r\nfrom which he is to select, what is pure and what is not, what is\r\nwholesome and what unhealthy, what is improving and what is trash? The\r\nanswer is--there are some lists which will be most useful in this\r\ndiscrimination, while there is no list which is infallible. Mr. F.\r\nLeypoldt's little catalogue of \"Books for all Time\" has nothing that any\r\nlibrary need do without. Another compendious list is published by the\r\nAmerican Library Association. And the more extensive catalogue prepared\r\nfor the World's Fair in 1893, and embracing about 5,000 volumes, entitled\r\n\"Catalogue of A. L. A. Library: 5,000 vols. for a popular library,\" while\r\nit has many mistakes and omissions, is a tolerably safe guide in making\r\nup a popular library. I may note that the list of novels in this large\r\ncatalogue put forth by the American Library Association has the names of\r\nfive only out of the twenty-eight writers of fiction heretofore\r\npronounced objectionable, and names a select few only of the books of\r\nthese five.\r\n\r\nAs for the later issues of the press, and especially the new novels, let\r\nhim skim them for himself, unless in cases where trustworthy critical\r\njudgments are found in journals. Running through a book to test its style\r\nand moral drift is no difficult task for the practiced eye.\r\n\r\nLet us suppose that you are cursorily perusing a novel which has made a\r\ngreat sensation, and you come upon the following sentence: \"Eighteen\r\nmillions of years would level all in one huge, common, shapeless ruin.\r\nPerish the microcosm in the limitless macrocosm! and sink this feeble\r\nearthly segregate in the boundless rushing choral aggregation!\" This is\r\nin Augusta J. Evans Wilson's story \"Macaria\", and many equally\r\nextraordinary examples of \"prose run mad\" are found in the novels of this\r\nonce noted writer. What kind of a model is that to form the style of the\r\nyouthful neophyte, to whom one book is as good as another, since it was\r\nfound on the shelves of the public library?\r\n\r\nI am not insisting that all books admitted should be models of style;\r\neven a purist must admit that one of the greatest charms of literature is\r\nits infinite variety. But when book after book is filled with such\r\nspecimens of literary lunacy as this, one is tempted to believe that\r\nHomer and Shakespeare, to say nothing of Thackeray and Hawthorne, have\r\nlived in vain.\r\n\r\nNever fear criticism of those who find fault with the absence from your\r\nlibrary of books that you know to be nearly worthless; their absence will\r\nbe a silent but eloquent protest against them, sure to be vindicated by\r\nthe utter oblivion into which they will fall. Many a flaming reputation\r\nhas been extinguished after dazzling callow admirers for six months, or\r\neven less. Do not dread the empty sarcasm, that may grow out of the\r\nexclusion of freshly printed trash, that your library is a \"back number.\"\r\nTo some poor souls every thing that is great and good in the world's\r\nliterature is a \"back number\"; and the Bible itself, with its immortal\r\npoetry and sublimity, is the oldest back number of all. It is no part of\r\nyour business as a librarian to cater to the tastes of those who act as\r\nif the reading of endless novels of sensation were the chief end of man.\r\nAs one fed on highly spiced viands and stimulating drinks surely loses\r\nthe appetite for wholesome and nourishing food, so one who reads only\r\nexciting and highly wrought fictions loses the taste for the\r\nmaster-pieces of prose and poetry.\r\n\r\nLet not the fear of making many mistakes be a bug-bear in your path. If\r\nyou are told that your library is too exclusive, reply that it has not\r\nmeans enough to buy all the good books that are wanted, and cannot afford\r\nto spend money on bad or even on doubtful ones. If you have excluded any\r\nhighly-sought-for book on insufficient evidence, never fail to revise the\r\njudgment. All that can be expected of any library is approximately just\r\nand wise selection, having regard to merit, interest, and moral tone,\r\nmore than to novelty or popularity.\r\n\r\nIn the matter of choice, individual opinions are of small value. Never\r\nbuy a book simply because some reader extols it as very fine, or\r\n\"splendid,\" or \"perfectly lovely.\" Such praises are commonly to be\r\ndistrusted in direct proportion to their extravagance.\r\n\r\nA good lesson to libraries is furnished in the experience of the\r\nCleveland (Ohio) Public Library. In 1878, out of 16,000 volumes in that\r\nlibrary, no less than 6,000 were novels. The governing board, on the\r\nplea of giving people what they wanted, bought nearly all new books of\r\nfiction, and went so far, even, as to buy of Pinkerton's Detective\r\nstories, fifteen copies each, fifteen of all Mrs. Southworth's novels,\r\netc. But a change took place in the board, and the librarian was\r\npermitted to stop the growing flood of worthless fiction, and as fast as\r\nthe books were worn out, they were replaced by useful reading. It\r\nresulted that four years later, with 40,000 volumes in the library, only\r\n7,000 were novels, or less than one-fifth, instead of more than one-third\r\nof the whole collection, as formerly. In the same time, the percentage of\r\nfiction drawn out was reduced from 69 per cent. of the aggregate books\r\nread, to 50 per cent.\r\n\r\nLibraries are always complaining that they cannot buy many valuable books\r\nfrom lack of funds. Yet some of them buy a great many that are valueless\r\nin spite of this lack. Can any thing be conceived more valueless than a\r\nset of Sylvanus Cobb's novels, reprinted to the number of thirty-five to\r\nforty, from the New York Ledger? Yet these have been bought for scores of\r\nlibraries, which could not afford the latest books in science and art, or\r\nbiography, history, or travel. There are libraries in which the latest\r\nbooks on electricity, or sewerage, or sanitary plumbing, might have saved\r\nmany lives, but which must go without them, because the money has been\r\nsquandered on vapid and pernicious literature.\r\n\r\nIn almost every library, while some branches of knowledge are fairly\r\nrepresented, others are not represented at all. Nearly all present\r\nglaring deficiencies, and these are often caused by want of systematic\r\nplan in building up the collection. Boards of managers are frequently\r\nchanged, and the policy of the library with them. All the more important\r\nis it that the librarian should be so well equipped with a definite aim,\r\nand with knowledge and skill competent to urge that aim consistently, as\r\nto preserve some unity of plan.\r\n\r\nI need not add that a librarian should be always wide awake to the needs\r\nof his library in every direction. It should be taken for granted that\r\nits general aim is to include the best books in the whole range of human\r\nknowledge. With the vast area of book production before him, he should\r\nstrengthen every year some department, taking them in order of\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\nSome scholarly writers tell us that very few books are essential to a\r\ngood education. James Russell Lowell named five, which in his view\r\nembraced all the essentials; namely, Homer, Dante, Shakespeare,\r\nCervantes, and Goethe's Faust. Prof. Charles E. Norton of Harvard\r\nremarked that this list might even be abridged so as to embrace only\r\nHomer, Dante and Shakespeare. I can only regard such exclusiveness as\r\nmisleading, though conceding the many-sidedness of these great writers.\r\nTo extend the list is the function of all public libraries, as well as of\r\nmost of the private ones. Next after the really essential books, that\r\nlibrary will be doing its public good service which acquires all the\r\nimportant works that record the history of man. This will include\r\nbiography, travels and voyages, science, and much besides, as well as\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nSpecial pains should be taken in every library to have every thing\r\nproduced in its own town, county, and State. Not only books, but all\r\npamphlets, periodicals, newspapers, and even broadsides or circulars,\r\nshould be sought for and stored up as memorials of the present age,\r\ntending in large part rapidly to disappear.\r\n\r\nIn selecting editions of standard authors, one should always\r\ndiscriminate, so as to secure for the library, if not the best, at least\r\ngood, clear type, sound, thick paper, and durable binding. Cheap and\r\npoor editions wear out quickly, and have to be thrown away for better\r\nones, which wise economy should have selected in the first place. For\r\nexample, a widely circulated edition of Scott's novels, found in most\r\nlibraries, has the type so worn and battered by the many large editions\r\nprinted from the plates, that many letters and words are wanting, thus\r\nspoiling not only the pleasure but abridging the profit of the reader in\r\nperusing the novels. The same is true of one edition of Cooper. Then\r\nthere are many cheap reprints of English novels in the Seaside and other\r\nlibraries which abound in typographical errors. A close examination of a\r\ncheap edition of a leading English novelist's works revealed more than\r\n3,000 typographical errors in the one set of books! It would be\r\nunpardonable carelessness to buy such books for general reading because\r\nthey are cheap.\r\n\r\nLibrarians should avoid what are known as subscription books, as a rule,\r\nthough some valid exceptions exist. Most of such books are profusely\r\nillustrated and in gaudy bindings, gotten up to dazzle the eye. If works\r\nof merit, it is better to wait for them, than to subscribe for an\r\nunfinished work, which perhaps may never reach completion.\r\n\r\nA librarian or book collector should be ever observant of what he may\r\nfind to enrich his collection. When in a book-store, or a private or\r\npublic library, he should make notes of such works seen as are new to\r\nhim, with any characteristics which their custodian may remark upon. Such\r\npersonal examination is more informing than any catalogue.\r\n\r\nI think each public library should possess, besides a complete set of the\r\nEnglish translations of the Greek and Latin classics, a full set of the\r\noriginals, for the benefit of scholarly readers. These classic texts can\r\nbe had complete in modern editions for a very moderate price.\r\n\r\nHow far duplicate volumes should be bought should depend upon demand, and\r\nthe views of the purchasing powers. There is a real need of more than one\r\ncopy of almost every standard work, else it will be perpetually out,\r\ngiving occasion for numerous complaints from those who use the library.\r\nIt would be a good rule to keep one copy always in, and at the service of\r\nreaders, of every leading history, standard poet, or popular novel. Then\r\nthe duplicate copies for circulation may be one or more, as experience\r\nand ability to provide may determine. A library which caters to the\r\nnovel-reading habit as extensively as the New York Mercantile (a\r\nsubscription library) has to buy fifty to one hundred copies of \"Trilby,\"\r\nfor example, to keep up with the demand. No such obligation exists for\r\nthe free public libraries. They, however, often buy half a dozen to a\r\ndozen copies of a very popular story, when new, and sell them out after\r\nthe demand has slackened or died away.\r\n\r\nThe methods of selection and purchase in public libraries are very\r\nvarious. In the Worcester (Mass.) Public Library, the librarian makes a\r\nlist of desiderata, has it manifolded, and sends a copy to each of the\r\nthirteen members of the Board of directors. This list is reported on by\r\nthe members at the next monthly meeting of the Board, and generally, in\r\nthe main, approved. Novels and stories are not bought until time has\r\nshown of what value they may be. The aim is mainly educational at the\r\nWorcester library, very special pains being taken to aid all the pupils\r\nand teachers in the public schools, by careful selection, and providing\r\nduplicate or more copies of important works.\r\n\r\nIn the Public Library of Cleveland, Ohio, there is appointed out of the\r\ngoverning Board a book-committee of three. To one of these are referred\r\nEnglish books wanted, to another French, and to the third German books.\r\nThis sub-committee approves or amends the Librarian's recommendations,\r\nat its discretion; but expensive works are referred to the whole board\r\nfor determination.\r\n\r\nIn the New York Mercantile Library, which must keep continually up to\r\ndate in its supply of new books, the announcements in all the morning\r\npapers are daily scanned, and books just out secured by immediate order.\r\nMany publishers send in books on approval, which are frequently bought.\r\nAn agent in London is required to send on the day of publication all new\r\nbooks on certain subjects.\r\n\r\nThe library boards of management meet weekly in New York and\r\nPhiladelphia, but monthly in most country libraries. The selection of\r\nbooks made by committees introduces often an element of chance, not quite\r\nfavorable to the unity of plan in developing the resources of the\r\nlibrary. But with a librarian of large information, discretion, and\r\nskill, there need seldom be any difficulty in securing approval of his\r\nselections, or of most of them. In some libraries the librarian is\r\nauthorized to buy at discretion additions of books in certain lines, to\r\nbe reported at the next meeting of the board; and to fill up all\r\ndeficiencies in periodicals that are taken. This is an important\r\nconcession to his judgment, made in the interest of completeness in the\r\nlibrary, saving a delay of days and sometimes weeks in waiting for the\r\nboard of directors.\r\n\r\nAll orders sent out for accessions should previously be compared with the\r\nalphabeted order-card list, as well as with the general catalogue of the\r\nlibrary, to avoid duplication. After this the titles are to be\r\nincorporated in the alphabet of all outstanding orders, to be withdrawn\r\nonly on receipt of the books.\r\n\r\nThe library should invite suggestions from all frequenting it, of books\r\nrecommended and not found in the collection. A blank record-book for this\r\npurpose, or an equivalent in order-cards, should be always kept on the\r\ncounter of the library.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 2.\r\n\r\nBOOK BUYING.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe buying of books is to some men a pastime; to others it is a passion;\r\nbut to the librarian and the intelligent book collector it is both a\r\nbusiness and a pleasure. The man who is endowed with a zeal for knowledge\r\nis eager to be continually adding to the stores which will enable him to\r\nacquire and to dispense that knowledge. Hence the perusal of catalogues\r\nis to him an ever fresh and fascinating pursuit. However hampered he may\r\nbe by the lack of funds, the zest of being continually in quest of some\r\ncoveted volumes gives him an interest in every sale catalogue, whether of\r\nbookseller or of auctioneer. He is led on by the perennial hope that he\r\nmay find one or more of the long-wished for and waited-for _desiderata_\r\nin the thin pamphlet whose solid columns bristle with book-titles in\r\nevery variety of abbreviation and arrangement. It is a good plan, if one\r\ncan possibly command the time, to read every catalogue of the book\r\nauctions, and of the second-hand book dealers, which comes to hand. You\r\nwill thus find a world of books chronicled and offered which you do not\r\nwant, because you have got them already: you will find many, also, which\r\nyou want, but which you know you cannot have; and you may find some of\r\nthe very volumes which you have sought through many years in vain. In any\r\ncase, you will have acquired valuable information--whether you acquire\r\nany books or not; since there is hardly a priced catalogue, of any\r\nconsiderable extent, from which you cannot reap knowledge of some\r\nkind--knowledge of editions, knowledge of prices, and knowledge of the\r\ncomparative scarcity or full supply of many books, with a glimpse of\r\ntitles which you may never have met before. The value of the study of\r\ncatalogues as an education in bibliography can never be over-estimated.\r\n\r\nThe large number of active and discriminating book-buyers from America\r\nhas for years past awakened the interest and jealousy of collectors\r\nabroad, where it has very largely enhanced the price of all first-class\r\neditions, and rare works.\r\n\r\nNo longer, as in the early days of Dibdin and Heber, is the competition\r\nfor the curiosities of old English literature confined to a half-score of\r\nnative amateurs. True, we have no such omnivorous gatherers of literary\r\nrubbish as that magnificent _helluo librorum_, Richard Heber, who amassed\r\nwhat was claimed to be the largest collection of books ever formed by a\r\nsingle individual. Endowed with a princely fortune, and an undying\r\npassion for the possession of books, he spent nearly a million dollars in\r\ntheir acquisition. His library, variously stated at from 105,000 volumes\r\n(by Dr. Dibdin) to 146,000 volumes (by Dr. Allibone) was brought to the\r\nhammer in 1834. The catalogue filled 13 octavo volumes, and the sale\r\noccupied 216 days. The insatiable owner (who was a brother of Reginald\r\nHeber, Bishop of Calcutta) died while still collecting, at the age of\r\nsixty, leaving his enormous library, which no single house of ordinary\r\nsize could hold, scattered in half a dozen mansions in London, Oxford,\r\nParis, Antwerp, Brussels and Ghent.\r\n\r\nYet the owner of this vast mass of mingled nonsense and erudition, this\r\nlibrary of the curiosities of literature, was as generous in imparting as\r\nin acquiring his literary treasures. No English scholar but was freely\r\nwelcome to the loan of his volumes; and his own taste and critical\r\nknowledge are said to have been of the first order.\r\n\r\nFrom this, probably the most extensive private library ever gathered, let\r\nus turn to the largest single purchase, in number of volumes, made at one\r\ntime for a public library. When Dr. J. G. Cogswell went abroad in 1848,\r\nto lay the foundations of the Astor Library, he took with him credentials\r\nfor the expenditure of $100,000; and, what was of even greater\r\nimportance, a thoroughly digested catalogue of _desiderata_, embracing\r\nthe most important books in every department of literature and science.\r\nNo such opportunity of buying the finest books at the lowest prices is\r\nlikely ever to occur again, as the fortuitous concourse of events brought\r\nto Dr. Cogswell. It was the year of revolutions--the year when the\r\nthrones were tottering or falling all over Europe, when the wealthy and\r\nprivileged classes were trembling for their possessions, and anxious to\r\nturn them into ready money. In every time of panic, political or\r\nfinancial, the prices of books, as well as of all articles of luxury, are\r\nthe first to fall. Many of the choicest collections came to the hammer;\r\nmultitudes were eager to sell--but there were few buyers except the book\r\nmerchants, who were all ready to sell again. The result was that some\r\n80,000 volumes were gathered for the Astor Library, embracing a very\r\nlarge share of the best editions and the most expensive works, with many\r\nbooks strictly denominated rare, and nearly all bound in superior style,\r\nat an average cost of about $1.40 per volume. This extraordinary good\r\nfortune enabled the Astor Library to be opened on a very small endowment,\r\nmore splendidly equipped for a library of reference than any new\r\ninstitution could be today with four or five times the money.\r\n\r\nCompared with such opportunities as these, you may consider the\r\nexperiences of the little libraries, and the narrow means of recruitment\r\ngenerally found, as very literally the day of small things. But a wise\r\napportionment of small funds, combined with a good knowledge of the\r\ncommercial value of books, and perpetual vigilance in using\r\nopportunities, will go very far toward enlarging any collection in the\r\nmost desirable directions.\r\n\r\nCompare for a moment with the results stated of the Astor Library's early\r\npurchases, the average prices paid by British Libraries for books\r\npurchased from 1826 to 1854, as published in a parliamentary return. The\r\naverage cost per volume varied from 16_s_ or about $4 a volume, for the\r\nUniversity Library of Edinburgh, to 4_s_ 6_d_, or $1.10 a volume for the\r\nManchester Free Library. The latter, however, were chiefly popular new\r\nbooks, published at low prices, while the former included many costly old\r\nworks, law books, etc. The British Museum Library's average was 8_s_ 5_d_\r\nor about $2.00 per volume. Those figures represent cloth binding, while\r\nthe Astor's purchases were mostly in permanent leather bindings.\r\n\r\nAverages are very uncertain standards of comparison, as a single book\r\nrarity often costs more than a hundred volumes of the new books of the\r\nday; but in a library filled with the best editions of classical and\r\nscientific works, and reference books, I presume that two dollars a\r\nvolume is not too high an estimate of average cost, in these days\r\nrepresented by the last twenty years. For a circulating library, on the\r\nother hand, composed chiefly of what the public most seek to read, half\r\nthat average would perhaps express the full commercial value of the\r\ncollection. Of its intrinsic value I will not here pause to speak.\r\n\r\nThere are many methods of book buying, of which we may indicate the\r\nprincipal as follows:\r\n\r\n    1. By direct orders from book dealers.\r\n    2. By competition on select lists of wants.\r\n    3. By order from priced catalogues.\r\n    4. By purchase at auction sales.\r\n    5. By personal research among book stocks.\r\n    6. By lists and samples of books sent on approval.\r\n\r\nEach of these methods has its advantages--and, I may add, its\r\ndisadvantages likewise. The collector who combines them, as opportunity\r\npresents, is most likely to make his funds go the farthest, and to enrich\r\nhis collection the most. Direct orders for purchase are necessary for\r\nmost new books wanted, except in the case of the one government library,\r\nwhich in most countries, receives them under copyright provision. An\r\nadvantageous arrangement can usually be made with one or more\r\nbook-dealers, to supply all new books at a fairly liberal discount from\r\nretail prices. And it is wise management to distribute purchases where\r\ngood terms are made, as thereby the trade will feel an interest in the\r\nlibrary, and a mutuality of interest will secure more opportunities and\r\nbetter bargains.\r\n\r\nThe submission of lists of books wanted, to houses having large stocks or\r\ngood facilities, helps to make funds go as far as possible through\r\ncompetition. By the typewriter such lists can now be manifolded much more\r\ncheaply than they can be written or printed.\r\n\r\nSelection from priced catalogues presents a constantly recurring\r\nopportunity of buying volumes of the greatest consequence, to fill gaps\r\nin any collection, and often at surprisingly low prices. Much as book\r\nvalues have been enhanced of late years, there are yet catalogues issued\r\nby American, English and continental dealers which quote books both of\r\nthe standard and secondary class at very cheap rates. Even now English\r\nbooks are sold by the Mudie and the W. H. Smith lending libraries in\r\nLondon, after a very few months, at one-half to one-fourth their original\r\npublishing price. These must usually be rebound, but by instructing your\r\nagent to select copies which are clean within, all the soil of the edges\r\nwill disappear with the light trimming of the binder.\r\n\r\nPurchase at auction supplies a means of recruiting libraries both public\r\nand private with many rare works, and with the best editions of the\r\nstandard authors, often finely bound. The choice private libraries of the\r\ncountry, as well as the poor ones, tend to pour themselves sooner or\r\nlater into public auctions. The collectors of books, whose early avidity\r\nto amass libraries of fine editions was phenomenal, rarely persist in\r\ncultivating the passion through life. Sometimes they are overtaken by\r\nmisfortune--sometimes by indifference--the bibliomania not being a\r\nperennial inspiration, but often an acute and fiery attack, which in a\r\nfew years burns out. Even if the library gathered with so much money and\r\npains descends to the heirs of the collector, the passion for books is\r\nvery seldom an inherited one. Thus the public libraries are constantly\r\nrecruited by the opportunities of selection furnished by the forced sale\r\nof the private ones. Here, public competition frequently runs up the\r\nprice of certain books to an exorbitant degree, while those not wanted\r\noften sell for the merest trifle. One should have a pretty clear idea of\r\nthe approximate commercial value of books, before competing for them at\r\npublic sale. He may, however, if well persuaded in his own mind as to the\r\nimportance or the relative unimportance to his own collection of any\r\nwork, regulate his bids by that standard, regardless of commercial value,\r\nexcept as a limit beyond which he will not go. Few librarians can\r\npersonally attend auction sales--nor is it needful, when limits can so\r\neasily be set to orders. It is never safe to send an unlimited bid, as\r\nthere may be others without limit, in which case the book is commonly\r\nawarded to the most remote bidder.\r\n\r\nThere are many curiosities of the auction room, one of them being the\r\nfrequent re-appearance of book rarities which have been through several\r\nauctions, sometimes at intervals of years, keenly competed for by rival\r\nbibliophiles, and carried off in triumph by some ardent collector, who\r\nlittle thought at the time how soon his own collection would come to the\r\nhammer.\r\n\r\nThere are also many curiosities of compilation in auction catalogues. Not\r\nto name errors of commission, like giving the authorship of books to the\r\nwrong name, and errors of omission, like giving no author's name at all,\r\nsome catalogues are thickly strewn with the epithets _rare_--and _very\r\nrare_, when the books are sufficiently common in one or the other market.\r\nDo not be misled by these surface indications. Books are often attributed\r\nin catalogues to their editor or translator, and the unwary buyer may\r\nthus find himself saddled with a duplicate already in his own collection.\r\nThere has been much improvement in late years in the care with which\r\nauction catalogues are edited, and no important collection at least is\r\noffered, without having first passed through the hands of an expert,\r\nfamiliar with bibliography. It is the minor book sales where the\r\ncatalogues receive no careful editing, and where the dates and editions\r\nare frequently omitted, that it is necessary to guard against. It is well\r\nto refrain from sending any bids out of such lists, because they furnish\r\nno certain identification of the books, and if all would do the same,\r\nthus diminishing the competition and the profit of the auctioneer, he\r\nmight learn never to print a catalogue without date, place of\r\npublication, and full name of author of every book offered.\r\n\r\nNever be too eager to acquire an auction book, unless you are very\r\nthoroughly assured that it is one of the kind truly designated\r\n_rarissimus_. An eminent and thoroughly informed book collector, with an\r\nexperience of forty years devoted to book auctions and book catalogues,\r\nassured me that it was his experience that almost every book would turn\r\nup on the average about every seven years. Of course there are notable\r\nexceptions--and especially among the class of books known as\r\n_incunabula_, (or cradle-books printed in the infancy of printing) and of\r\nearly Americana: but it is not these which the majority of libraries are\r\nmost in search of. Remember always, if you lose a coveted volume, that\r\nthere will be another chance--perhaps many of them. The private\r\ncollector, who carries it off against you, has had no former opportunity\r\nto get the rare volume, and may never have another. He is therefore\r\njustified in paying what is to ordinary judgment an extraordinary price.\r\nIndividual collectors die, but public libraries are immortal.\r\n\r\nIf you become thoroughly conversant with priced catalogues, you will make\r\nfewer mistakes than most private buyers. Not only catalogues of notable\r\ncollections, with the prices obtained at auction, but the large and very\r\ncopious catalogues of such London book-dealers as Quaritch and Sotheran,\r\nare accessible in the great city libraries. These are of the highest use\r\nin suggesting the proximate prices at which important books have been or\r\nmay be acquired. Since 1895, annual volumes entitled \"American Book\r\nPrices Current\" have been issued, giving the figures at which books have\r\nbeen sold at all the principal auction sales of the year.\r\n\r\nThere is no word so much abused as the term _rare_, when applied to\r\nbooks. Librarians know well the unsophisticated citizen who wants to sell\r\nat a high price a \"rare\" volume of divinity \"a hundred and fifty years\r\nold\" (worth possibly twenty-five cents to half a dollar,) and the\r\npersistent woman who has the rarest old bible in the country, which she\r\nvalues anywhere from fifty to five hundred dollars, and which turns out\r\non inspection to be an imperfect copy of one of Barker's multitudinous\r\neditions of 1612 to '18, which may be picked up at five to eight\r\nshillings in any old London book-shop. The confident assertions so often\r\nparaded, even in catalogues, \"only three copies known,\" and the like, are\r\nto be received with absolute incredulity, and the claims of ignorant\r\nowners of books who fancy that their little pet goose is a fine swan,\r\nbecause they never saw another, are as ridiculous as the laudation\r\nbestowed by a sapient collector upon two of his most valued nuggets.\r\n\"This, sir, is unique, but not so unique as the other.\"\r\n\r\nBuying books by actual inspection at the book-shops is even more\r\nfascinating employment than buying them through catalogues. You thus come\r\nupon the most unexpected volumes unawares. You open the covers, scan the\r\ntitle-pages, get a glimpse of the plates, and flit from book to book,\r\nlike a bee gathering honey for its hive. It is a good way to recruit your\r\nlibrary economically, to run through the stock of a book-dealer\r\nsystematically--neglecting no shelf, but selecting throughout the whole\r\nstock, and laying aside what you think you may want. When this is done,\r\nyou will have quite a pile of literature upon which to negotiate with the\r\nproprietor. It is cheaper to buy thus at wholesale than by piecemeal,\r\nbecause the bookseller will make you a larger discount on a round lot of\r\nwhich you relieve his shelves.\r\n\r\nAnother method of recruiting your library is the examination of books \"on\r\napproval.\" Most book-dealers will be so obliging as to send in parcels of\r\nbooks for the inspection of a librarian or collector, who can thus\r\nexamine them leisurely and with more thoroughness than in a book store,\r\nwithout leaving his business.\r\n\r\nAll books, by whatever course they may be purchased, are indispensably\r\nto be collated before they are accepted and paid for. Neglect of this\r\nwill fill any library with imperfections, since second-hand books are\r\nliable to have missing leaves, or plates, or maps, while new books may\r\nlack signatures or plates, or be wrongly bound together. In the case of\r\nnew books, or books still in print, the publisher is bound to make good\r\nan imperfection.\r\n\r\nIn old books, this is usually impossible, and the only remedy is to\r\nreturn the imperfect books upon the seller's hands, unless there may be a\r\nreason, such as the rarity of the volume, or its comparative little cost,\r\nor the trifling nature of the imperfection, for retaining it. The\r\nequities in these cases are in favor of the buyer, who is presumed to\r\nhave purchased a perfect copy. But the right of reclamation must be\r\nexercised promptly, or it may be forfeited by lapse of time. If an\r\nimperfection in any book you order is noted in the catalogue, it is not\r\nsubject to return. I have ever found the book auctioneers most courteous\r\nand considerate in their dealings--and the same can be said of the book\r\ntrade generally, among whom instances of liberality to libraries are by\r\nno means rare.\r\n\r\nOne of the choicest pleasures of the book collector, whether private\r\nstudent or librarian, is to visit the second-hand book-shops of any city,\r\nand examine the stock with care. While he may find but few notable\r\ntreasures in one collection, a search through several shops will be\r\nalmost sure to reward him. Here are found many of the outpourings of the\r\nprivate libraries, formed by specialists or amateurs, and either\r\npurchased by the second-hand dealer _en bloc_, or bid off by him at some\r\nauction sale. Even rare books are picked up in this way, no copies of\r\nwhich can be had by order, because long since \"out of print.\" The stock\r\nin these shops is constantly changing, thus adding a piquant and\r\nsometimes exciting element to the book-hunter, who is wise in proportion\r\nas he seizes quickly upon all opportunities of new \"finds\" by frequent\r\nvisits. To mourn over a lost chance in rare books is often more grievous\r\nto the zealous collector, than to lose a large share out of his fortune;\r\nwhile to exult over a literary nugget long sought and at length found is\r\na pleasure to which few others can be compared.\r\n\r\nOf the many _bouquinistes_ whose open-air shops line the quays of Paris\r\nalong the Seine, numbering once as many as a hundred and fifty dealers in\r\nsecond-hand books, I have no room to treat; books have been written about\r\nthem, and the _littérateurs_ of France, of Europe, and of America have\r\nprofited by countless bargains in their learned wares. Nor can I dwell\r\nupon the literary wealth of London book-shops, dark and dingy, but ever\r\nattractive to the hungry scholar, or the devotee of bibliomania.\r\n\r\nOf the many second-hand booksellers (or rather sellers of second-hand\r\nbooks) in American cities, the more notable have passed from the stage of\r\naction in the last quarter of a century. Old William Gowans, a quaint,\r\nintelligent Scotchman, in shabby clothes and a strong face deeply marked\r\nwith small pox, was for many years the dean of this fraternity in New\r\nYork. His extensive book-shop in Nassau street, with its dark cellar, was\r\ncrowded and packed with books on shelves, on stairways and on the floors,\r\nheaped and piled in enormous masses, amid which the visitor could hardly\r\nfind room to move. On one of the piles you might find the proprietor\r\nseated--\r\n\r\n    Books to the right of him,\r\n    Books to the left of him,\r\n    Books behind him,\r\n    Volleyed and tumbled,\r\n\r\nwhile he answered inquiries for books from clergymen and students, or\r\ngruffly bargained with a boy or an old woman for a dilapidated lot of\r\nold books. He had a curious quizzical way with strangers, who at once set\r\nhim down as an oddity, and his impatience with ignoramuses and bores gave\r\nhim the repute of crustiness, which was redeemed by suavity enough\r\nwhenever he met with people of intelligence.\r\n\r\nGowans issued scores of catalogues of his stock, in which titles were\r\noften illustrated by notes, always curious and often amusing, credited to\r\n\"Western Memorabilia,\" a work which no bookseller or man of letters had\r\never heard of, but which was shrewdly suspected to have been a projected\r\nscrap-book of the observations and opinions of William Gowans.\r\n\r\nThere was another eccentric book-dealer's shop in Nassau street kept by\r\none John Doyle, who aimed so high in his profession as to post over his\r\ndoor a sign reading \"The Moral Centre of the Intellectual Universe.\" This\r\nestablishment was notably full of old editions of books of English\r\nhistory and controversial theology.\r\n\r\nThe most famous second-hand book-shop in Boston was Burnham's, whose\r\nfore-name was Thomas Oliver Hazard Perry, shortened into \"Perry Burnham\"\r\nby his familiars. He was a little, pale-faced, wiry, nervous man, with\r\npiercing black eyes and very brusque manners. In old and musty books he\r\nlived and moved and had his being, for more than a generation. He\r\nexchanged a stuffy, narrow shop in Cornhill for more spacious quarters in\r\nWashington street, near School street, where he bought and sold books\r\nwith an assiduous devotion to business, never trusting to others what he\r\ncould do himself. He was proud of his collection and its extent. He\r\nbought books and pamphlets at auction literally by the cart-load, every\r\nthing that nobody else wanted being bid off to Burnham at an\r\ninsignificant price, almost nominal. He got a wide reputation for\r\nselling cheaply, but he always knew when to charge a stiff price for a\r\nbook, and to stick to it. Once when I was pricing a lot of miscellaneous\r\nbooks picked out for purchase, mostly under a dollar a volume, we came to\r\na copy of \"The Constitutions of the Several Independent States of\r\nAmerica,\" 1st edition, Philadelphia, 1781, of which two hundred copies\r\nonly were printed, by order of Congress. This copy was in the original\r\nboards, uncut, and with the autograph of Timothy Pickering on the title\r\npage. \"If the Congress Library wants that book,\" said Mr. Burnham, \"it\r\nwill have to pay eight dollars for it.\" I took it, well pleased to secure\r\nwhat years of search had failed to bring. The next year my satisfaction\r\nwas enhanced when an inferior copy of the same book was offered at twenty\r\ndollars.\r\n\r\nBurnham died a wealthy man, having amassed a million dollars in trade and\r\nby rise in real estate, as he owned the land on which the Parker House\r\nstands in Boston.\r\n\r\nAmong Philadelphia dealers in second-hand books, one John Penington was\r\nrecognized as most intelligent and honorable. He was a book-lover and a\r\nscholar, and one instinctively ranked him not as a bookseller, but as a\r\ngentleman who dealt in books. On his shelves one always found books of\r\nscience and volumes in foreign languages.\r\n\r\nAnother notable dealer was John Campbell, a jolly, hearty Irish-American,\r\nwith a taste for good books, and an antipathy to negroes, as keen as the\r\nproverbial hatred of the devil for holy water. Campbell wrote a book\r\nentitled \"Negromania,\" published in 1851, in which his creed was set\r\nforth in strong language. He was a regular bidder at book auctions, where\r\nhis burly form and loud voice made him a prominent figure.\r\n\r\nOf notable auction sales of books, and of the extravagant prices obtained\r\nfor certain editions by ambitious and eager competition, there is little\r\nroom to treat. The oft-told story of the Valdarfer Boccaccio of 1471,\r\ncarried off at the Roxburghe sale in 1812, at £2,260 from Earl Spencer by\r\nthe Marquis of Blandford, and re-purchased seven years after at another\r\nauction for £918, has been far surpassed in modern bibliomania. \"The\r\nsound of that hammer,\" wrote the melodramatic Dibdin, \"echoed through\r\nEurope:\" but what would he have said of the Mazarin Bible of Gutenberg\r\nand Fust (1450-55) sold in 1897, at the Ashburnham sale, for four\r\nthousand pounds, or of the Latin Psalter of Fust and Schoeffer, 2d ed.\r\n1459, which brought £4,950 at the Syston Park sale in 1884? This last sum\r\n(about twenty-four thousand dollars) is the largest price ever yet\r\nrecorded as received for a single volume. Among books of less rarity,\r\nthough always eagerly sought, is the first folio Shakespeare of 1623, a\r\nvery fine and perfect copy of which brought £716.2 at Daniel's sale in\r\n1864. Copies warranted perfect have since been sold in London for £415 to\r\n£470. In New York, a perfect but not \"tall\" copy brought $4,200 in 1891\r\nat auction. Walton's \"Compleat Angler,\" London, 1st ed. 1653, a little\r\nbook of only 250 pages, sold for £310 in 1891. It was published for one\r\nshilling and sixpence. The first edition of Robinson Crusoe brought £75\r\nat the Crampton sale in 1896.\r\n\r\nThe rage for first editions of very modern books reached what might be\r\ncalled high-water mark some time since, and has been on the decline.\r\nShelley's \"Queen Mab,\" 1st ed. 1813, was sold at London for £22.10, and\r\nhis \"Refutation of Deism,\" 1814, was sold at £33, at a London sale in\r\n1887. In New York, many first editions of Shelley's poems brought the\r\nfollowing enormous prices in 1897.\r\n\r\n    Shelley's Adonais, 1st ed. Pisa, Italy, 1821, $335.\r\n    Alastor, London, 1816, $130.\r\n    The Cenci, Italy, 1819, $65.\r\n    Hellas, London, 1822, $13.\r\n\r\nBut these were purely adventitious prices, as was clearly shown in the\r\nsale at the same auction rooms, a year or two earlier, of the following:\r\n\r\n    Shelley's Adonais, 1st ed. Pisa, 1821, $19.\r\n    Alastor, London, 1816, $32.\r\n    The Cenci, Italy, 1819, $21.\r\n    Hellas, London, 1822, $2.\r\n\r\nThe sales occasionally made at auction of certain books at extraordinary\r\nprices, prove nothing whatever as to the real market value, for these\r\nreasons: (1) The auctioneer often has an unlimited bid, and the price is\r\ncarried up to an inordinate height. (2) Two or more bidders present,\r\ninfatuated by the idea of extreme rarity, bid against one another until\r\nall but one succumb, when the price has reached a figure which it is a\r\nmild use of terms to call absurd. (3) Descriptions in sale catalogues,\r\nthough often entirely unfounded, characterising a book as \"excessively\r\nrare;\" \"only -- copies known,\" \"very scarce,\" \"never before offered at\r\nour sales,\" etc., may carry the bidding on a book up to an unheard-of\r\nprice.\r\n\r\nThe appeal always lies to the years against the hours; and many a poor\r\nbook-mad enthusiast has had to rue his too easy credulity in giving an\r\nextravagant sum for books which he discovers later that he could have\r\nbought for as many shillings as he has paid dollars. Not that the\r\n_rarissimi_ of early printed books can ever be purchased for a trifle;\r\nbut it should ever be remembered that even at the sales where a few--a\r\nvery few--bring the enormous prices that are bruited abroad, the mass of\r\nthe books offered are knocked down at very moderate figures, or are even\r\nsacrificed at rates very far below their cost. The possessor of one of\r\nthe books so advertised as sold at some auction for a hundred dollars or\r\nupwards, if he expects to realise a tithe of the figure quoted, will\r\nspeedily find himself in the vocative.\r\n\r\nWhile there are almost priceless rarities not to be found in the market\r\nby any buyer, let the book collector be consoled by the knowledge that\r\ngood books, in good editions, were never so easy to come by as now. A\r\nfine library can be gathered by any one with very moderate means,\r\nsupplemented by a fair amount of sagacity and common sense. The buyer\r\nwith a carefully digested list of books wanted will find that to buy them\r\nwisely takes more time and less money than he had anticipated. The time\r\nis required to acquaint himself with the many competing editions, with\r\ntheir respective merits and demerits. This involves a comparison of type,\r\npaper, and binding, as well as the comparative prices of various dealers\r\nfor the same books. No one who is himself gifted with good perceptions\r\nand good taste, should trust to other hands the selection of his library.\r\nHis enjoyment of it will be proportioned to the extent to which it is his\r\nown creation. The passion for nobly written books, handsomely printed,\r\nand clothed in a fitting garb, when it has once dawned, is not to be\r\ndefrauded of its satisfaction by hiring a commission merchant to appease\r\nit. What we do for ourselves, in the acquirement of any knowledge, is apt\r\nto be well done: what is done for us by others is of little value.\r\n\r\nWe have heard of some uninformed _parvenus_, grown suddenly rich, who\r\nhave first ordered a magnificent library room fitted with rose-wood,\r\nmarble and gilded trappings, and then ordered it to be filled with\r\nsplendidly bound volumes at so much per volume. And it is an authentic\r\nfact, that a bookseller to the Czar of Russia one Klostermann, actually\r\nsold books at fifty to one hundred roubles by the yard, according to the\r\nbinding. The force of folly could no farther go, to debase the aims and\r\ndegrade the intellect of man.\r\n\r\nIn the chapter upon rare books, the reader will find instances in great\r\nvariety of the causes that contribute to the scarcity and enhancement of\r\nprices of certain books, without at all affecting their intrinsic value,\r\nwhich may be of the smallest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 3.\r\n\r\nTHE ART OF BOOK BINDING.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn these suggestions upon the important question of the binding of books,\r\nI shall have nothing to say of the history of the art, and very little of\r\nits aesthetics. The plainest and most practical hints will be aimed at,\r\nand if my experience shall prove of value to any, I shall be well\r\nrewarded for giving it here. For other matters readers will naturally\r\nconsult some of the numerous manuals of book-binding in English, French\r\nand German. The sumptuous bindings executed in the sixteenth century,\r\nunder the patronage and the eyes of Grolier, the famous tooled\r\nmasterpieces of Derome, Le Gascon, Padeloup, Trautz and other French\r\nartists, and the beautiful gems of the binder's art from the hands of\r\nRoger Payne, Lewis, Mackenzie, Hayday and Bedford, are they not\r\ncelebrated in the pages of Dibdin, Lacroix, Fournier, Wheatley, and\r\nRobert Hoe?\r\n\r\nThere are some professed lovers of books who affect either indifference\r\nor contempt for the style in which their favorites are dressed. A well\r\nknown epigram of Burns is sometimes quoted against the fondness for fine\r\nbindings which widely prevails in the present day, as it did in that of\r\nthe Scottish Poet. A certain Scottish nobleman, endowed with more wealth\r\nthan brains, was vain of his splendidly bound Shakespeare, which,\r\nhowever, he never read. Burns, on opening the folio, found the leaves\r\nsadly worm-eaten, and wrote these lines on the fly-leaf:\r\n\r\n    \"Through and through th' inspired leaves,\r\n        Ye maggots make your windings;\r\n      But O respect his lordship's taste,\r\n        And spare the golden bindings!\"\r\n\r\nYet no real book-lover fails to appreciate the neatness and beauty of a\r\ntasteful binding, any more than he is indifferent to the same qualities\r\nin literary style. Slovenly binding is almost as offensive to a\r\ncultivated eye as slovenly composition. No doubt both are \"mere\r\nexternals,\" as we are told, and so are the splendors of scenery, the\r\nbeauty of flowers, and the comeliness of the human form, or features, or\r\ncostume. Talk as men will of the insignificance of dress, it constitutes\r\na large share of the attractiveness of the world in which we live.\r\n\r\nThe two prime requisites of good binding for libraries are neatness and\r\nsolidity. It is pleasant to note the steady improvement in American\r\nbindings of late years. As the old style of \"Half cloth boards,\" of half\r\na century ago, with paper titles pasted on the backs, has given way to\r\nthe neat, embossed, full muslin gilt, so the clumsy and homely sheep-skin\r\nbinding has been supplanted by the half-roan or morocco, with marble or\r\nmuslin sides. Few books are issued, however, either here or abroad, in\r\nwhat may be called permanent bindings. The cheapness demanded by buyers\r\nof popular books forbids this, while it leaves to the taste and fancy of\r\nevery one the selection of the \"library style\" in which he will have his\r\ncollection permanently dressed.\r\n\r\nWhat is the best style of binding for a select or a public library? is a\r\nquestion often discussed, with wide discrepancies of opinion. The so\r\nuniversally prevalent cloth binding is too flimsy for books subjected to\r\nmuch use--as most volumes in public collections and many in private\r\nlibraries are likely to be. The choice of the more substantial bindings\r\nlies between calf and morocco, and between half or full bindings of\r\neither. For nearly all books, half binding, if well executed, and with\r\ncloth sides, is quite as elegant, and very nearly as solid and lasting as\r\nfull leather; for if a book is so worn as to need rebinding, it is\r\ngenerally in a part where the full binding wears out quite as fast as the\r\nother. That is, it gets worn at the hinges and on the back, whether full\r\nor half-bound. The exceptions are the heavy dictionaries, encyclopaedias,\r\nand other works of reference, which are subjected to much wear and tear\r\nat the sides, as well as at the back and corners. Full leather is much\r\nmore expensive than half binding, though not doubly so.\r\n\r\nEvery librarian or book collector should understand something of\r\nbook-binding and its terms, so that he may be able to give clear\r\ndirections as to every item involved in binding, repairing, or\r\nre-lettering, and to detect imperfect or slighted work.\r\n\r\nThe qualities that we always expect to find in a well-bound book are\r\nsolidity, flexibility, and elegance. Special examination should be\r\ndirected toward each of these points in revising any lot of books\r\nreturned from a binder. Look at each book with regard to:--\r\n\r\n    1. Flexibility in opening.\r\n\r\n    2. Evenness of the cover, which should lie flat and\r\n    smooth--each edge being just parallel with the others\r\n    throughout.\r\n\r\n    3. Compactness--see that the volumes are thoroughly\r\n    pressed--solid, and not loose or spongy.\r\n\r\n    4. Correct and even lettering of titles, and other tooling.\r\n\r\n    5. Good wide margins.\r\n\r\nA well-bound book always opens out flat, and stays open. It also shuts up\r\ncompletely, and when closed stays shut. But how many books do we see\r\nalways bulging open at the sides, or stiffly resisting being opened by\r\ntoo great tightness in the back? If the books you have had bound do not\r\nmeet all these requirements, it is time to look for another binder.\r\n\r\nThe different styles of dressing books may all be summed up in the\r\nfollowing materials: Boards, cloth, vellum, sheep, bock, pig-skin, calf,\r\nRussia, and morocco--to which may be added of recent years, buckram,\r\nduck, linoleum, and the imitations of leather, such as leatherette and\r\nmorocco paper, and of parchment. I take no account here of obsolete\r\nstyles--as ivory, wood, brass, silver and other metals, nor of velvet,\r\nsatin, and other occasional luxuries of the binder's art. These belong to\r\nthe domain of the amateur, the antiquary, or the book-fancier--not to\r\nthat of the librarian or the ordinary book-collector.\r\n\r\nRoan leather is nothing but sheep-skin, stained or colored; basil or\r\nbasan is sheepskin tanned in bark, while roan is tanned in sumac, and\r\nmost of the so called moroccos are also sheep, ingeniously grained by a\r\nmechanical process. As all the manufactures in the world are full of\r\n\"shoddy,\" or sham materials, the bookbinder's art affords no exception.\r\nBut if the librarian or collector patronises shams, he should at least do\r\nit with his eyes open, and with due counting of the cost.\r\n\r\nNow as to the relative merits and demerits of materials for binding. No\r\none will choose boards covered with paper for any book which is to be\r\nsubjected to perusal, and cloth is too flimsy and shaky in its attachment\r\nto the book, however cheap, for any library volumes which are to be\r\nconstantly in use. It is true that since the bulk of the new books coming\r\ninto any library are bound in cloth, they may be safely left in it until\r\nwell worn; and by this rule, all the books which nobody ever reads may be\r\nexpected to last many years, if not for generations. Cloth is a very\r\ndurable material, and will outlast some of the leathers, but any wetting\r\ndestroys its beauty, and all colors but the darkest soon become soiled\r\nand repulsive, if in constant use. In most libraries, I hold that every\r\ncloth-bound book which is read, must sooner or later come to have a\r\nstout leather jacket. It may go for years, especially if the book is well\r\nsewed, but to rebinding it must come at last; and the larger the volume,\r\nthe sooner it becomes shaky, or broken at some weak spot.\r\n\r\nThe many beautiful new forms of cloth binding should have a word of\r\npraise, but the many more which we see of gaudy, fantastic, and\r\nmeretricious bindings, and frightful combinations of colors must be\r\nviewed with a shudder.\r\n\r\nVellum, formerly much used for book-bindings, is the modern name for\r\nparchment. Parchment was the only known writing material up to the 12th\r\ncentury, when paper was first invented. There are two kinds--animal and\r\nvegetable. The vegetable is made from cotton fibre or paper, by dipping\r\nit in a solution of sulphuric acid and [sometimes] gelatine, then\r\nremoving the acid by a weak solution of ammonia, and smooth finishing by\r\nrolling the sheets over a heated cylinder. Vegetable parchment is used to\r\nbind many booklets which it is desired to dress in an elegant or dainty\r\nstyle, but is highly unsuitable for library books. Vellum proper is a\r\nmuch thicker material, made from the skins of calves, sheep, or lambs,\r\nsoaked in lime-water, and smoothed and hardened by burnishing with a hard\r\ninstrument, or pumice-stone. The common vellum is made from sheep-skin\r\nsplits, or skivers, but the best from whole calf-skins. The hard, strong\r\ntexture of vellum is in its favor, but its white color and tendency to\r\nwarp are fatal objections to it as a binding material.\r\n\r\nVellum is wholly unfit for the shelves of a library; the elegant white\r\nbinding soils with dust, or the use of the hands, more quickly than any\r\nother; and the vellum warps in a dry climate, or curls up in a heated\r\nroom, so as to be unmanageable upon the shelves, and a nuisance in the\r\neyes of librarian and reader alike. The thin vegetable parchment lately\r\nin vogue for some books and booklets is too unsubstantial for anything\r\nbut a lady's boudoir, where it may have its little day--\"a thing of\r\nbeauty,\" but by no means \"a joy forever.\"\r\n\r\nSheepskin--once the full binding for most school-books, and for a large\r\nshare of law and miscellaneous works for libraries, is now but little\r\nused, except in its disguised forms. It is too soft a leather for hard\r\nwear and tear, and what with abrasion and breaking at the hinges (termed\r\nby binders the joints), it will give little satisfaction in the long run.\r\nUnder the effect of gas and heated atmospheres sheep crumbles and turns\r\nto powder. Its cheapness is about its only merit, and even this is\r\ndoubtful economy, since no binding can be called cheap that has to be\r\nrebound or repaired every few years. In the form of half-roan or bock,\r\ncolored sheep presents a handsome appearance on the shelf, and in volumes\r\nor sets which are reasonably secure from frequent handling, one is\r\nsometimes justified in adopting it, as it is far less expensive than\r\nmorocco. Pig-skin has been recently revived as a binding material, but\r\nthough extremely hard and durable, it is found to warp badly on the\r\nshelves.\r\n\r\nCalf bindings have always been great favorites with book-lovers, and\r\nthere are few things more beautiful--_prima facie_, than a volume\r\ndaintily bound in light French calf, as smooth as glass, as fine as silk,\r\nwith elegant gold tooling without and within, gilt edges, and fly-leaves\r\nof finest satin. I said beautiful, _prima facie_--and this calls to mind\r\nthe definition of that law term by a learned Vermont jurist, who said:\r\n\"Gentlemen of the jury, I must explain to you that a _prima facie_ case\r\nis a case that is very good in front, but may be very bad in the rear.\"\r\nSo of our so much lauded and really lovely calf bindings: they develop\r\nqualities in use which give us pause. Calf is the most brittle of the\r\nleathers--hence it is always breaking at the hinges; it is a very smooth\r\nleather--hence it shows every scratch instantly; it is a light and\r\ndelicate leather--hence it shows soils and stains more quickly than any\r\nother. Out of every hundred calf-bound volumes in any well-used library,\r\nthere will not remain ten which have not had to be re-bound or repaired\r\nat the end of twenty or thirty years. Heavy volumes bound in calf or\r\nhalf-calf leather will break by their own weight on the shelves, without\r\nany use at all; and smaller volumes are sure to have their brittle joints\r\nsnapped asunder by handling sooner or later--it is only a question of\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nNext comes Russia leather, which is very thick and strong, being made of\r\nthe hides of cattle, colored, and perfumed by the oil of birch, and made\r\nchiefly in Russia. The objections to this leather are its great cost, its\r\nstiffness and want of elasticity, and its tendency to desiccate and lose\r\nall its tenacity in the dry or heated atmosphere of our libraries. It\r\nwill break at the hinges--though not so readily as calf.\r\n\r\nLastly, we have the morocco leather, so called because it was brought\r\nfrom Morocco, in Africa, and still we get the best from thence, and from\r\nthe Mediterranean ports of the Levant--whence comes another name for the\r\nbest of this favorite leather, \"Levant morocco,\" which is the skin of the\r\nmountain goat, and reckoned superior to all other leathers. The\r\ncharacteristics of the genuine morocco, sometimes called Turkey morocco,\r\nhaving a pebbled grain, distinguishing it from the smooth morocco, are\r\nits toughness and durability, combined with softness and flexibility. It\r\nhas a very tenacious fibre, and I have never found a real morocco binding\r\nbroken at the hinges. The old proverb--\"there is nothing like\r\nleather\"--is pregnant with meaning, and especially applies to the best\r\nmorocco. As no material yet discovered in so many ages can take the\r\nplace of leather for foot-wear and for harness, such is its tenacity and\r\nelasticity--so for book coverings, to withstand wear and tear, good\r\nleather is indispensable. There are thoroughly-bound books existing which\r\nare five centuries old--representing about the time when leather began to\r\nreplace wood and metals for binding. The three great enemies of books are\r\ntoo great heat, too much moisture, and coal gas, which produces a\r\nsulphurous acid very destructive to bindings, and should never be used in\r\nlibraries. From the dangers which destroy calf and Russia leather,\r\nmorocco is measurably free.\r\n\r\nAs to color, I usually choose red for books which come to binding or\r\nrebinding, for these reasons. The bulk of every library is of dark and\r\nsombre color, being composed of the old-fashioned calf bindings, which\r\ngrow darker with age, mingled with the cloth bindings of our own day, in\r\nwhich dark colors predominate. Now the intermixture of red morocco, in\r\nall or most of the newly bound books, relieves the monotony of so much\r\nblackness, lights up the shelves, and gives a more cheerful aspect to the\r\nwhole library. Some there are who insist upon varying the colors of\r\nbindings with the subjects of the books--and the British Museum Library\r\nactually once bound all works on botany in green, poetry in yellow,\r\nhistory in red, and theology in blue; but this is more fanciful than\r\nimportant. A second reason for preferring red in moroccos is that, being\r\ndyed with cochineal, it holds its color more permanently than any\r\nother--the moroccos not colored red turning to a dingy, disagreeable\r\nbrown after forty or fifty years, while the red are found to be fast\r\ncolors. This was first discovered in the National Library of France, and\r\never since most books in that great collection have been bound in red. A\r\ncelebrated binder having recommended this color to a connoisseur who was\r\nhaving fine morocco binding done, instanced the example of the Paris\r\nLibrary, whose books, said he, are \"mostly red,\" to which the amateur\r\nreplied that he hoped they were.\r\n\r\nAdd to the merits of morocco leather the fact that it is not easily\r\nscratched nor stained, that it is very tough in wear, and resists better\r\nthan any other the moisture and soiling of the hands--and we have a\r\nmaterial worthy of all acceptance.\r\n\r\nIn half-binding chosen for the great majority of books because it is much\r\ncheaper than full leather, the sides are covered with muslin or with some\r\nkind of colored paper--usually marble. The four corners of every book,\r\nhowever, should always be protected by leather or, better still, by\r\nvellum, which is a firmer material--otherwise they will rapidly wear off,\r\nand the boards will break easily at their corners. As to the relative\r\nmerits of cloth and paper for the sides of books, cloth is far more\r\ndurable, though it costs more. Paper becomes quickly frayed at the edges,\r\nor is liable to peel where pasted on, though it may be renewed at small\r\nexpense, and may properly be used except upon the much-read portion of\r\nthe library. The cloth or paper should always harmonize in color with the\r\nleather to which it is attached. They need not be the same, but they\r\nshould be of similar shade.\r\n\r\nOne more reason for preferring morocco to other leathers is that you can\r\nalways dispense with lettering-pieces or patches in gilding the titles on\r\nthe back. All light-colored bindings (including law calf) are open to the\r\nobjection that gold lettering is hardly legible upon them. Hence the\r\nnecessity of stamping the titles upon darker pieces of leather, which are\r\nfastened to the backs. These lettering-pieces become loose in over-heated\r\nlibraries, and tend continually to peel off, entailing the expense of\r\nrepairing or re-lettering. Every morocco bound book can be lettered\r\ndirectly upon the leather. Bock is made of the skin of the Persian sheep,\r\nand is called Persian in London. It is a partially unsuccessful imitation\r\nof morocco, becoming easily abraded, like all the sheep-skin leathers,\r\nand although it is to be had in all colors, and looks fairly handsome for\r\na time, and is tougher than skiver (or split sheep-skin), the books that\r\nare bound in it will sooner or later become an eyesore upon the shelves.\r\nA skin of Persian leather costs about one-third the price of genuine\r\nmorocco, or goat. But the actual saving in binding is in a far less\r\nratio--the difference being only six to eight cents per volume. It is\r\nreally much cheaper to use morocco in the first place, than to undergo\r\nall the risks of deterioration and re-binding.\r\n\r\nOf the various imitations of leather, or substitutes for it, we have\r\nleatherette, leather-cloth, duck, fibrette, feltine, and buckram. Buckram\r\nand duck are strong cotton or linen fabricks, made of different colors,\r\nand sometimes figured or embossed to give them somewhat the look of\r\nleather. Hitherto, they are made mostly in England, and I have learned of\r\nno American experience in their favor except the use of stout duck for\r\ncovering blank books and binding newspapers. The use of buckram has been\r\nmostly abandoned by the libraries. Morocco cloth is American, but has no\r\nadvantage over plain muslin or book cloth, that I am aware of.\r\nLeatherette, made principally of paper, colored and embossed to simulate\r\nmorocco leather, appears to have dropped out of use almost as fast as it\r\ncame in, having no quality of permanence, elegance, or even of great\r\ncheapness to commend it. Leatherette tears easily, and lacks both\r\ntenacity and smoothness.\r\n\r\nBoth feltine and fibrette are made of paper--tear quickly, and are unfit\r\nfor use on any book that is ever likely to be read. All these imitations\r\nof leather are made of paper as their basis, and hence can never be\r\nproper substitutes for leather.\r\n\r\nAll torn leaves or plates in books should be at once mended by pasting a\r\nvery thin onion-skin paper on both sides of the torn leaf, and pressing\r\ngently between leaves of sized paper until dry.\r\n\r\nCorners made of vellum or parchment are more durable than any leather.\r\nWhen dry, the parchment becomes as hard almost as iron and resists falls\r\nor abrasion. To use it on books where the backs are of leather is a\r\ndeparture from the uniformity or harmony of style insisted upon by many,\r\nbut in binding books that are to be greatly worn, use should come before\r\nbeauty.\r\n\r\nIn rebinding, all maps or folded plates should be mounted on thin canvas,\r\nlinen, or muslin, strong and fine, to protect them from inevitable\r\ntearing by long use. If a coarse or thick cloth is used, the maps will\r\nnot fold or open easily and smoothly.\r\n\r\nThe cutting or trimming of the edges of books needs to be watched with\r\njealous care. Few have reflected that the more margin a binder cuts off,\r\nthe greater his profit on any job, white paper shavings having a very\r\nappreciable price by the pound. A strictly uncut book is in many American\r\nlibraries a rarity. And of the books which go a second time to the\r\nbinder, although at first uncut, how many retain their fair proportions\r\nof margin when they come back? You have all seen books in which the text\r\nhas been cut into by the ruthless knife-machine of the binder. This is\r\ncalled \"bleeding\" a book, and there are no words strong enough to\r\ndenounce this murderous and cold-blooded atrocity. The trimming of all\r\nbooks should be held within the narrowest limits--for the life of a book\r\ndepends largely upon its preserving a good margin. Its only chance of\r\nbeing able to stand a second rebinding may depend upon its being very\r\nlittle trimmed at its first. If it must be cut at all, charge your binder\r\nto take off the merest shaving from either edge.\r\n\r\nEvery new book or magazine added to the library, if uncut, should be\r\ncarefully cut with a paper-knife before it goes into the hands of any\r\nreader. Spoiled or torn or ragged edges will be the penalty of neglecting\r\nthis. You have seen people tear open the leaves of books and magazines\r\nwith their fingers--a barbarism which renders him who would be guilty of\r\nit worthy of banishment from the resorts of civilization. In cutting\r\nbooks, the leaves should always be held firmly down--and the knife\r\npressed evenly through the uncut leaves to the farthest verge of the\r\nback. Books which are cut in the loose fashion which many use are left\r\nwith rough or ragged edges always, and often a slice is gouged out of the\r\nmargin by the mis-directed knife. Never trust a book to a novice to be\r\ncut, without showing him how to do it, and how not to do it.\r\n\r\nThe collation of new books in cloth or _broché_ should be done before\r\ncutting, provided they are issued to readers untrimmed. In collating\r\nbooks in two or more volumes double watchfulness is needed to guard\r\nagainst a missing signature, which may have its place filled by the same\r\npages belonging to another volume--a mixture sometimes made in binderies,\r\nin \"gathering\" the sheets, and which makes it necessary to see that the\r\nsignatures are right as well as the pages. The collator should check off\r\nall plates and maps called for by the table of contents to make sure that\r\nthe copy is perfect. Books without pagination are of course to have their\r\nleaves counted, which is done first in detail, one by one, and then\r\nverified by a rapid counting in sections, in the manner used by printers\r\nand binders in counting paper by the quire.\r\n\r\nThe binding of books may be divided into two styles or methods, namely,\r\nmachine-made book-bindings, and hand-made bindings. Binding by machinery\r\nis wholly a modern art, and is applied to all or nearly all new books\r\ncoming from the press. As these are, in more than nine cases out of ten,\r\nbound in cloth covers, and these covers, or cases, are cut out and\r\nstamped by machinery, such books are called \"case-made.\" The distinction\r\nbetween this method of binding and the hand method is that in the former\r\nthe case is made separately from the book, which is then put into it.\r\nAfter the sheets of any book come pressed and dried from the printing\r\noffice, the first step is to fold them from the large flat sheets into\r\nbook form. This is sometimes done by hand-folders of bone or some other\r\nhard material, but in large establishments for making books, it is done\r\nby a folding machine. This will fold ten thousand or more sheets in a\r\nday. The folded sheets are next placed in piles or rows, in their\r\nnumerical sequence, and \"gathered\" by hand, _i. e._: a bindery hand picks\r\nup the sheets one by one, with great rapidity, until one whole book is\r\ngathered and collated, and the process is repeated so long as any sheets\r\nremain. Next, the books are thoroughly pressed or \"smashed\" as it is\r\ncalled, in a powerful smashing-machine, giving solidity to the book,\r\nwhich before pressing was loose and spongy. Then the books are sawed or\r\ngrooved in the back by another machine, operating a swiftly moving saw,\r\nand sewed on cords by still another machine, at about half the cost of\r\nhand-sewing. Next, they are cut or trimmed on the three edges in a\r\ncutting-machine. The backs of the books are made round by a\r\nrounding-machine, leaving the back convex and the front concave in form,\r\nas seen in all finished books. The books are now ready for the covers.\r\nThese consist of binders' board or mill-board, cut out of large sheets\r\ninto proper size, with lightning-like rapidity, by another machine\r\ncalled a rotary board-cutter. The cloth which is to form the back and\r\nsides of the book is cut out, of proper size for the boards, from great\r\nrolls of stamped or ribbed or embossed muslin, by another machine. The\r\nuse of cloth, now so universal for book-binding, dates back little more\r\nthan half a century. About 1825, Mr. Leighton, of London, introduced it\r\nas a substitute for the drab-colored paper then used on the sides, and\r\nfor the printed titles on the backs. The boards are firmly glued to the\r\ncloth, the edges of which are turned over the boards, and fastened on the\r\ninside of the covers. The ornamental stamps or figures seen on the\r\ncovers, both at the back and sides are stamped in with a heated die of\r\nbrass, or other metal, worked by machinery. The lettering of the title is\r\ndone in the same way, only that gold-leaf is applied before the die\r\nfalls. Lastly, the book is pasted by its fly leaves or end-leaves,\r\n(sometimes with the addition of a cloth guard) to the inside of the cloth\r\ncase or cover, and the book is done, after a final pressing. By these\r\nrapid machine methods a single book-manufacturing house can turn out ten\r\nthousand volumes in a day, with a rapidity which almost takes the breath\r\naway from the beholder.\r\n\r\nThere is a kind of binding which dispenses entirely with sewing the\r\nsheets of a book. The backs are soaked with a solution of india-rubber,\r\nand each sheet must be thoroughly agglutinated to the backs, so as to\r\nadhere firmly to its fellows. This requires that all the sheets shall be\r\nfolded as single leaves or folios, otherwise the inner leaves of the\r\nsheets, having no sewing, would drop out. This method is employed on\r\nvolumes of plates, music, or any books made up of large separate sheets.\r\n\r\nIn notable contrast to these rapid methods of binding what are termed\r\ncase-made books, comes the hand-made process, where only partial use of\r\nmachinery is possible.\r\n\r\nThe rebinding process is divided into three branches: preparing,\r\nforwarding, and finishing. The most vital distinction between a\r\nmachine-made and a hand-made binding, is that the cloth or case-made book\r\nis not fastened into its cover in a firm and permanent way, as in\r\nleather-backed books. It is simply pasted or glued to its boards--not\r\ninterlaced by the cords or bands on which it is sewed. Hence one can\r\neasily tear off the whole cover of a cloth-bound book, by a slight\r\neffort, and such volumes tend to come to pieces early, under constant\r\nwear and tear of library service.\r\n\r\nLet us now turn to the practical steps pursued in the treatment of books\r\nfor library use. In re-binding a book, the first step is to take the book\r\napart, or, as it is sometimes called, to take it to pieces. This is done\r\nby first stripping off its cover, if it has one. Cloth covers easily come\r\noff, as their boards are not tied to the cords on which the book is\r\nsewed, but are simply fastened by paste or glue to the boards by a muslin\r\nguard, or else the cloth is glued to the back of the book. If the book is\r\nleather-covered, or half-bound, _i. e._: with a leather back and\r\n(usually) leather on its four corners, taking it to pieces is a somewhat\r\nslower process. The binder's knife is used to cut the leather at the\r\njoints or hinges of the volume, so that the boards may be removed. The\r\ncords that tie the boards to the volume are cut at the same time. If the\r\nbook has a loose or flexible back, the whole cover comes easily off: if\r\nbound with a tight back, the glued leather back must be soaked with a\r\nsponge full of water, till it is soft enough to peel off, and let the\r\nsheets be easily separated.\r\n\r\nThe book is now stripped of its former binding, and the next step is to\r\ntake it apart, signature by signature. A signature is that number of\r\nleaves which make up one sheet of the book in hand. Thus, an octavo\r\nvolume, or a volume printed in eights, as it is called, has eight leaves,\r\nor sixteen pages to a signature; a quarto four leaves; a duodecimo, or 12\r\nmo. twelve leaves. The term signature (from Lat. _signare_, a sign) is\r\nalso applied to a letter or figure printed at the foot of the first page\r\nof each sheet or section of the book. If the letters are used, the\r\nsignatures begin with A. and follow in regular sequence of the alphabet.\r\nIf the book is a very thick one, (or more than twenty-six signatures)\r\nthen after signature Z, it is customary to duplicate the letters--A.\r\nA.--etc., for the remaining signatures. If figures are used instead of\r\nletters, the signatures run on to the last, in order of numbers. These\r\nletters, indicating signatures are an aid to the binder, in folding,\r\n\"gathering,\" and collating the consecutive sheets of any book, saving\r\nconstant reference to the \"pagination,\" as it is termed, or the paging of\r\nthe volume, which would take much more time. In many books, you find the\r\nsignature repeated in the \"inset,\" or the inner leaves of the sheet, with\r\na star or a figure to mark the sequence. Many books, however, are now\r\nprinted without any signature marks whatever.\r\n\r\nTo return: in taking apart the sheets or signatures, where they are stuck\r\ntogether at the back by adhesive glue or paste, the knife is first used\r\nto cut the thread in the grooves, where the book is sewed on cords or\r\ntape. Then the back is again soaked, the sheets are carefully separated,\r\nand the adhering substance removed by the knife or fingers. Care has to\r\nbe taken to lay the signatures in strict order or sequence of pages, or\r\nthe book may be bound up wrongly. The threads are next to be removed from\r\nthe inside of every sheet. The sheets being all separated, the book is\r\nnext pressed, to render all the leaves smooth, and the book solid for\r\nbinding. Formerly, books were beaten by a powerful hammer, to accomplish\r\nthis, but it is much more quickly and effectively done in most binderies\r\nby the ordinary screw press. Every pressing of books should leave them\r\nunder pressure at least eight hours.\r\n\r\nAfter pressing, the next step is to sew the sheets on to cords or twine,\r\nset vertically at proper distances in a frame, called a \"sewing bench,\"\r\nfor this purpose. No book can be thoroughly well bound if the sewing is\r\nslighted in any degree. Insist upon strong, honest linen thread--if it\r\nbreaks with a slight pull it is not fit to be used in a book. The book is\r\nprepared for the sewer by sawing several grooves across the back with a\r\ncommon saw. The two end grooves are light and narrow, the central ones\r\nwider and deeper. Into these inner grooves, the cords fit easily, and the\r\nbook being taken, sheet by sheet, is firmly sewed around the cords, by\r\nalternate movements of the needle and thread, always along the middle of\r\nthe sheet, the thread making a firm knot at each end (called the\r\n\"kettle-stitch\") as it is returned for sewing on the next sheet.\r\nSometimes the backs are not sawed at all, but the sheets of the book are\r\nsewed around the cords, which thus project a little from the back, and\r\nform the \"bands,\" seen in raised form on the backs of some books. Books\r\nshould be sewed on three to six cords, according to their size. This\r\nraised-band sewing is reckoned by some a feature of excellent binding.\r\nThe sunken-band style is apt to give a stiff back, while the raised bands\r\nare usually treated with a flexible back. When sewed, the book is\r\ndetached from its fellows, which may have been sewed on the same bench,\r\nby slipping it along the cords, then cutting them apart, so as to leave\r\nsome two inches of each cord projecting, as ends to be fastened later to\r\nthe board. In careful binding, the thread is sewed \"all along,\" _i. e._:\r\neach sheet by itself, instead of \"two on,\" as it is called.\r\n\r\nThe next process is termed \"lining up,\" and consists of putting on the\r\nproper fly-leaves or end-leaves, at the beginning and end of the volume.\r\nThese usually consist of four leaves of ordinary white printing paper at\r\neach end, sometimes finished out with two leaves of colored or marbled\r\npaper, to add a touch of beauty to the book when opened. Marbled paper is\r\nmore durable in color than the tinted, and does not stain so easily. One\r\nof these end-leaves is pasted down to the inside cover, while the other\r\nis left flying--whence \"fly-leaf.\"\r\n\r\nAfter this comes the cutting of the book at the edges. This is done by\r\nscrewing it firmly in a cutting-machine, which works a sharp knife\r\nrapidly, shaving off the edges successively of the head, front and end,\r\nor \"tail\" as it is called in book-binding parlance. This trimming used to\r\nbe done by hand, with a sharp cutting knife called by binders a \"plough.\"\r\nNow, there are many forms of cutting machines, some of which are called\r\n\"guillotines\" for an obvious reason. In binding some books, which it is\r\ndesired to preserve with wide margins, only a mere shaving is taken off\r\nthe head, so as to leave it smooth at the top, letting the front and tail\r\nleaves remain uncut. But in case of re-binding much-used books, the edges\r\nare commonly so much soiled that trimming all around may be required, in\r\norder that they may present a decent appearance. Yet in no case should\r\nthe binder be allowed to cut any book deeply, so as to destroy a good,\r\nfair margin. Care must also be taken to cut the margins evenly, at right\r\nangles, avoiding any crooked lines.\r\n\r\nAfter cutting the book comes \"rounding,\" or giving the back of the book a\r\ncurved instead of its flat shape. This process is done with the hand, by\r\na hammer, or in a rounding press, with a metallic roller. Before\r\nrounding, the back of the book is glued up, that is, receives a coating\r\nof melted glue with a glueing brush, to hold the sections together, and\r\nrender the back firm, and a thorough rubbing of the back with hot glue\r\nbetween the sections gives strength to the volume.\r\n\r\nNext comes the treatment of the edges of the book, hitherto all white, in\r\norder to protect them from showing soil in long use. Sometimes (and this\r\nis the cheaper process) the books are simply sprinkled at the edges with\r\na brush dipped in a dark fluid made of burnt umber or red ochre, and\r\nshaken with a quick concussion near the edges until they receive a\r\nsprinkle of color from the brush. Other books receive what is called a\r\nsolid color on the edges, the books being screwed into a press, and the\r\ncolor applied with a sponge or brush.\r\n\r\nBut a marbled edge presents a far more handsome appearance, and should\r\nharmonize in color and figure with the marbled paper of the end leaves.\r\nMarbling, so called from its imitation of richly veined colored marble,\r\nis staining paper or book edges with variegated colors. The process of\r\nmarbling is highly curious, both chemically and aesthetically, and may be\r\nbriefly described. A large shallow trough or vat is filled with prepared\r\ngum water (gum-tragacanth being used); on the surface of this gum-water\r\nbright colors, mixed with a little ox-gall, to be used in producing the\r\ncomposite effect aimed at in the marbling are thrown or sprinkled in\r\nliquid form. Then they are deftly stirred or agitated on the surface of\r\nthe water, with an implement shaped to produce a certain pattern. The\r\nmost commonly used one is a long metallic comb, which is drawn across the\r\nsurface of the combined liquids, leaving its pattern impressed upon the\r\nductile fluid. The edges of the book to be marbled are then touched or\r\ndipped on the top of the water, on which the coloring matter floats, and\r\nat once withdrawn, exhibiting on the edge the precise pattern of \"combed\r\nmarble\" desired, since the various colors--red, yellow, blue, white,\r\netc., have adhered to the surface of the book-edges. The serrated and\r\ndiversified effect of most comb-marbling is due to stroking the comb in\r\nwaved lines over the surface. The spotted effect so much admired in other\r\nforms, is produced by throwing the colors on with a brush, at the fancy\r\nof the skilled workman, or artist, as you may call him. Marbled paper is\r\nmade in the same way, by dipping one surface of the white sheet, held in\r\na curved form, with great care on the surface of the coloring vat. This\r\nis termed shell and wave marbling, as distinguished from comb-marbling.\r\nThe paper or the book edges are next finished by sizing and burnishing,\r\nwhich gives them a bright glistening appearance.\r\n\r\nA still more ornate effect in a book is attained by gilding the edges.\r\nFrequently the head of a book is gilt, leaving the front and tail of an\r\nuncut book without ornament, and this is esteemed a very elegant style by\r\nbook connoisseurs, who are, or should be solicitous of wide margins. The\r\ngilding of the top edge is a partial protection from dust falling inside,\r\nto which the other edges are not so liable. To gild a book edge, it is\r\nplaced in a press, the edges scraped or smoothed, and coated with a\r\nred-colored fluid, which serves to heighten the effect of the gold. Then\r\na sizing is applied by a camel's-hair brush, being a sticky substance,\r\nusually the white of an egg, mixed with water (termed by binders\r\n\"glaire\") and the gold-leaf is laid smoothly over it. When the sizing is\r\ndry, the gold is burnished with a tool, tipped with an agate or\r\nblood-stone, drawn forcibly over the edge until it assumes a glistening\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\nAfter the edges have been treated by whatever process, there follows what\r\nis termed the \"backing\" of the book. The volume is pressed between iron\r\nclamps, and the back is hammered or rolled where it joins the sides, so\r\nas to form a groove to hold the boards forming the solid portion of the\r\ncover of every book. A backing-machine is sometimes used for this\r\nprocess, making by pressure the joint or groove for the boards. Then the\r\n\"head-band\" is glued on, being a silk braid or colored muslin, fastened\r\naround a cord, which projects a little above the head and the tail, at\r\nthe back of the book, giving it a more finished appearance. At the same\r\ntime, a book-mark for keeping the place is sometimes inserted and\r\nfastened like the head-band. This is often a narrow ribbon of colored\r\nsilk, or satin, and helps to give a finish to the book, as well as to\r\nfurnish the reader a trustworthy guide to keep a place--as it will not\r\nfall out like bits of paper inserted for that purpose.\r\n\r\nNext, the mill-boards are applied, cut so as to project about an eighth\r\nto a quarter of an inch from the edges of the book on three sides. The\r\nbook is held to the boards by the ends of its cords being interlaced, _i.\r\ne._: passed twice through holes pierced in the boards, the loose ends of\r\nthe cords being then wet with paste and hammered down flat to the surface\r\nof the boards. The best tar-boards should be used, which are made of old\r\nrope; no board made of straw is fit to be used on any book. Straw boards\r\nare an abomination--a cheap expedient which costs dearly in the end. The\r\nbinder should use heavy boards on the larger and thicker volumes, but\r\nthin ones on all duodecimos and smaller sizes.\r\n\r\nNext, the books are subjected to a second pressing, after which the\r\nlining of the back is in order. Good thick brown paper is generally used\r\nfor this, cut to the length of the book, and is firmly glued to the back,\r\nand rubbed down closely with a bone folder. A cloth \"joint,\" or piece of\r\nlinen (termed \"muslin super,\") is often glued to the back, with two\r\nnarrow flaps to be pasted to the boards, on each side, thus giving\r\ngreater tenacity to the covering. If the book is to be backed so as to\r\nopen freely, that is, to have a spring back or elastic back, two\r\nthicknesses of a firm, strong paper, or thin card-board are used, one\r\nthickness of the paper being glued to the back of the book, while the\r\nother--open in the middle, but fastened at the edges, is to be glued to\r\nthe leather of which the back is to be made.\r\n\r\nAfter this, comes putting the book in leather. If full bound a piece of\r\nleather cut full size of the volume, with about half an inch over, is\r\nfirmly glued or pasted to the boards and the back, the leather being\r\nturned over the edges of the boards, and nicely glued on their inside\r\nmargin. It is of great importance that the edges of the leather should be\r\nsmoothly pared down with a sharp knife, so as to present an even edge\r\nwhere the leather joins the boards, not a protuberance--which makes an\r\nugly and clumsy piece of work, instead of a neat one.\r\n\r\nFor half-binding, a piece of leather is taken large enough to cover the\r\nback lengthwise, and turn in at the head and tail, while the width should\r\nbe such as to allow from one to one and a half inches of the leather to\r\nbe firmly glued to the boards next the back. The four corners of the\r\nboards are next to be leathered, the edges of the leather being carefully\r\npared down, to give a smooth surface, even with the boards, when turned\r\nin. The leather is usually wet, preparatory to being manipulated thus,\r\nwhich renders it more flexible and ductile than in its dry state. The\r\ncloth or marbled paper is afterwards pasted or glued to the sides of the\r\nbook, and turned neatly over the edge of the boards.\r\n\r\nIt may be added, that the edges of the boards, in binding nice books, are\r\nsometimes ground off on a swiftly revolving emery-wheel, giving the book\r\na beveled edge, which is regarded as handsomer and more finished than a\r\nstraight rectangular edge.\r\n\r\nAll the processes hitherto described are called \"forwarding\" the book: we\r\nnow come to what is denominated \"finishing.\" This includes the lettering\r\nof the title, and the embellishing of the back and sides, with or without\r\ngilding, as the case may be. Before this is taken in hand, the leather of\r\nthe book must be perfectly dry. For the lettering, copper-faced types are\r\nused to set up the desired sequence of letters and words, and care and\r\ntaste should be exercised to have (1) Types neither too large, which\r\npresent a clumsy appearance, nor too small, which are difficult to read.\r\n(2) Proper spacing of the words and lines, and \"balancing\" the component\r\nparts of the lettering on the back, so as to present a neat and\r\nharmonious effect to the eye. A word should never be divided or\r\nhyphenated in lettering, when it can be avoided. In the case of quite\r\nthin volumes, the title may be lettered lengthwise along the back, in\r\nplain, legible type, instead of in very small letters across the back,\r\nwhich are often illegible. The method of applying gold lettering is as\r\nfollows: the back of the book where the title is to go, is first\r\nmoistened with a sticky substance, as albumen or glaire, heretofore\r\nmentioned, laid on with a camel's hair brush. The type (or the die as the\r\ncase may be) is heated in a binder's charcoal furnace, or gas stove, to\r\ninsure the adhesion of the gold leaf. The thin gold leaf (which comes\r\npacked in little square \"books,\" one sheet between every two leaves) is\r\nthen cut the proper size by the broad thin knife of the \"finisher,\" and\r\ncarefully laid over the sized spot to receive the lettering. Usually, two\r\nthicknesses of gold leaf are laid one above another, which ensures a\r\nbrighter and more decided effect in the lettering. The type metal or die\r\nis then pressed firmly and evenly down upon the gold-leaf, and the\r\nsurplus shavings of the gold carefully brushed off and husbanded, for\r\nthis leaf is worth money. The gold leaf generally in use costs about\r\n$6.50 for 500 little squares or sheets. It is almost inconceivably thin,\r\nthe thickness of one gold leaf being estimated at about 1/280000 of an\r\ninch.\r\n\r\nBesides the lettering, many books receive gold ornamentation on the back\r\nor side of a more or less elaborate character. Designs of great artistic\r\nbeauty, and in countless variety, have been devised for book ornaments,\r\nand French and English book-binders have vied with each other for\r\ngenerations in the production of decorative borders, fillets,\r\ncentre-pieces, rolls, and the most exquisite gold-tooling, of which the\r\nart is capable.\r\n\r\nThese varied patterns of book ornamentation are cut in brass or steel,\r\nand applied by the embossing press with a rapidity far exceeding that of\r\nthe hand-work formerly executed by the gilders of books. But for choice\r\nbooks and select jobs, only the hands are employed, with such fillets,\r\nstamps, pallets, rolls, and polishing irons as may aid in the nice\r\nexecution of the work. If a book is to be bound in what is called\r\n\"morocco antique,\" it is to be \"blind-tooled,\" _i. e._: the hot iron\r\nwheels which impress the fillets or rolls, are to be worked in blank, or\r\nwithout gold-leaf ornamentation. This is a rich and tasteful binding,\r\nespecially with carefully beveled boards, and gilded edges.\r\n\r\nOn some books, money has been lavished on the binding to an amount\r\nexceeding by many fold the cost of the book itself. Elegant book-binding\r\nhas come to be reckoned as a fine art, and why should not \"the art\r\npreservative of all other arts\"--printing--be preserved in permanent and\r\nsumptuous, if not splendid style, in its environment? Specimens of French\r\nartistic binding from the library of Grolier, that celebrated and\r\nmunificent patron of art, who died in 1565, have passed through the hands\r\nof many eager connoisseurs, always at advancing prices. The Grolier\r\nbinding was notable for the elegant finish of its interlaced ornaments\r\nin gold-leaf, a delicacy of touch, and an inimitable flowing grace, which\r\nmodern binders have struggled after in vain. At the Beckford Library sale\r\nin London, in 1884, there was a great array of fine French bindings of\r\nearly date. A book from Grolier's library, the \"Toison d'Or,\" 1563,\r\nbrought £405, or over $2,000, and a Heptameron, which had belonged to\r\nLouis XIV, in beautiful brown morocco, with crown, fleur-de-lys, a stag,\r\na cock, and stars, as ornaments, all exquisitely worked in gold, lined\r\nwith vellum, was sold for £400. Following the Grolier patterns, came\r\nanother highly decorative style, by the French binders, which was notable\r\nfor the very delicate gold tooling, covering the whole sides of the book\r\nwith exquisite scroll-work, and branches of laurel.\r\n\r\nThe most celebrated of English book-binders was Roger Payne, who was\r\nnotable for the careful labor bestowed on the forwarding and finishing of\r\nhis books, specimens of which are still reckoned among the\r\n_chefs-d'oeuvre_ of the art. His favorite style was a roughly-grained red\r\nmorocco, always full-bound, and he kept in view what many binders forget,\r\nthat the leather is the main thing in a finely executed binding, not to\r\nbe overlaid by too much gilding and decoration. He charged twelve guineas\r\neach (over $60) for binding some small volumes in his best style. Payne's\r\nmost notable successors have been Lewis, Hayday, Bedford, and Zaehnsdorf,\r\nthe latter of whom is the author of a treatise on book-binding. At the\r\nart exhibition of 1862, a book bound by Bedford was exhibited, which took\r\ntwo months merely to finish, and the binding cost forty guineas; and a\r\nDoré's Dante, exquisitely bound by Zaehnsdorf, in Grolier style, cost one\r\nhundred guineas.\r\n\r\nA decorative treatment not yet mentioned is applied to the covers of some\r\nbooks, which are bound in elegant full calf. To give to this leather the\r\nelegant finish known as \"tree-calf binding\", it is first washed with\r\nglaire or albumen. The boards of the book are then bent to a convex\r\nshape, and water sprinkled over, until it runs down from the centre in\r\nmany little branches or rivulets. While running, a solution of copperas\r\nis sprinkled on, and carried along the branches which radiate from the\r\ncentral trunk, producing the dark-mottled colored effect which resembles,\r\nmore or less nearly, a tree with its spreading branches.\r\n\r\nTo make the book beautiful should be the united aim of all who are\r\nconcerned in its manufacture--the paper-maker, the printer, and the\r\nbook-binder. While utility comes first in the art of book-making for\r\nlibraries, yet neatness and even elegance should always be united with\r\nit. An ill-forwarded book, or a badly finished one, presents a clumsy,\r\nunattractive look to the eye; while an evenly made piece of work, and a\r\ncareful and tasteful ornamentation in the gilding, attract every\r\ndiscerning reader by their beauty. One writer upon book-binding terms the\r\nforwarder of the book an artizan, and the finisher an artist; but both\r\nshould have the true artist's taste, in order to produce the work that\r\nshall commend itself by intrinsic excellence. The form and shape of the\r\nbook depend wholly, indeed, on the forwarder.\r\n\r\nWe are told that the great beauty of the Grolier bindings lay in the\r\nlavish and tasteful adornment of the sides. In fact, much depends upon\r\nthe design, in every piece of decorative work. The pretty scroll\r\npatterns, the interlaced figures, the delicate tracery, the circles,\r\nrosettes, and stars, the lovely arabesques, the flowers and leaves\r\nborrowed from the floral kingdom, the geometric lines, the embroidered\r\nborders, like fine lace-work,--all these lend their separate individual\r\ncharms to the finish of the varied specimens of the binder's art. There\r\nare some books that look as brilliant as jewels in their rich, lustrous\r\nadornment, the design sometimes powdered with gold points and stars. Some\r\ngems of art are lined with rich colored leather in the inside covers,\r\nwhich are stamped and figured in gold. This is termed \"_doublé_\" by the\r\nFrench. Some have their edges gilded over marbling, a refinement of\r\nbeauty which adds richness to the work, the marble design showing through\r\nthe brilliant gold, when the edge is turned. Others have pictorial\r\ndesigns drawn on the edges, which are then gilded over the pictures. This\r\ncomplex style of gilding, the French term _gaufré_. It was formerly much\r\nin vogue, but is latterly out of fashion. Many gems of binding are\r\nadorned with fly-leaves of moire silk, or rich colored satin. Color,\r\ninterspersed with gold in the finish of a book covering, heightens the\r\neffect. The morocco of the side-cover is sometimes cut, and inlaid with\r\nleather of a different color. Inlaying with morocco or kid is the richest\r\nstyle of decoration which the art has yet reached. Beautiful bindings\r\nhave been in greater request during the past twenty years than ever\r\nbefore. There was a renaissance of the ancient styles of decoration in\r\nFrance, and the choice Grolier and Maioli patterns were revived with the\r\ngeneral applause of the lovers of fine books.\r\n\r\nIn vivid contrast to these lovely specimens of the binder's art, are\r\nfound innumerable bibliopegic horrors, on the shelves of countless\r\nlibraries, public and private. Among these are to be reckoned most law\r\nbooks, clad in that dead monotony of ugliness, which Charles Dickens has\r\ndescribed as \"that _under-done pie-crust_ cover, which is technically\r\nknown as law calf.\" There are other uncouth and unwholesome specimens\r\neverywhere abroad, \"whom Satan hath bound\", to borrow Mr. Henry Stevens's\r\nwitty application of a well-known Scripture text. Such repellant\r\nbindings are only fit to serve as models to be avoided by the librarian.\r\n\r\nThe binding that is executed by machinery is sometimes called \"commercial\r\nbinding\". It is also known as \"edition binding\", because the whole\r\nedition of a book is bound in uniform style of cover. While the modern\r\nfigured cloth binding originated in England, it has had its fullest\r\ndevelopment in the United States. Here, those ingenious and powerful\r\nmachines which execute every branch of the folding and forwarding of a\r\nbook, and even the finishing of the covers, with almost lightning speed,\r\nwere mostly invented and applied. Very vivid is the contrast between the\r\nquiet, humdrum air of the old-fashioned bindery hand-work, and the\r\nceaseless clang and roar of the machinery which turns out thousands of\r\nvolumes in a day.\r\n\r\n    \"Not as ours the books of old,\r\n    Things that steam can stamp and fold.\"\r\n\r\nI believe that I failed to notice, among the varieties of material for\r\nbook-bindings heretofore enumerated, some of the rarer and more singular\r\nstyles. Thus, books have been bound in enamel, (richly variegated in\r\ncolor) in Persian silk, in seal-skin, in the skin of the rabbit,\r\nwhite-bear, crocodile, cat, dog, mole, tiger, otter, buffalo, wolf, and\r\neven rattle-snake. A favorite modern leather for purses and satchels,\r\nalligator-skin, has been also applied to the clothing of books. Many\r\neccentric fancies have been exemplified in book-binding, but the acme of\r\ngruesome oddity has been reached by binding books in human skin, of which\r\nmany examples are on record. It is perhaps three centuries old, but the\r\nfirst considerable instance of its use grew out of the horrors of the\r\nFrench Revolution. In England, the Bristol law library has several\r\nvolumes bound in the skin of local criminals, flayed after execution,\r\nand specially tanned for the purpose. It is described as rather darker\r\nthan vellum. A Russian poet is said to have bound his sonnets in human\r\nleather--his own skin--taken from a broken thigh--and the book he\r\npresented to the lady of his affections! Such ghoulish incidents as these\r\nafford curious though repulsive glimpses of the endless vagaries of human\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nIt is said that the invention of half-binding originated among the\r\neconomists of Germany; and some wealthy bibliophiles have stigmatized\r\nthis style of dressing books as \"genteel poverty.\" But its utility and\r\neconomy have been demonstrated too long to admit of any doubt that\r\nhalf-binding has come to stay; while, as we have seen, it is also capable\r\nof attractive aesthetic features. Mr. William Matthews, perhaps the\r\nforemost of American binders, said that \"a book when neatly forwarded,\r\nand cleanly covered, is in a very satisfactory condition without any\r\nfinishing or decorating.\" It was this same binder who exhibited at the\r\nNew York World's Fair Exhibition of 1853, a copy of Owen Jones's\r\nAlhambra, bound by him in full Russia, inlaid with blue and red morocco,\r\nwith gold tooling all executed by hand, taking six months to complete,\r\nand costing the binder no less than five hundred dollars.\r\n\r\nBook lettering, or stamping the proper title on the back of the book, is\r\na matter of the first importance. As the titles of most books are much\r\ntoo long to go on the back, a careful selection of the most distinctive\r\nwords becomes necessary. Here the taste and judgment of the librarian\r\ncome indispensably into play. To select the lettering of a book should\r\nnever be left to the binder, because it is not his business, and because,\r\nin most cases, he will make a mistake somewhere in the matter. From want\r\nof care on this point, many libraries are filled with wrongly lettered\r\nbooks, misleading titles, and blunders as ludicrous as they are\r\ndistressing. I have had to have thousands of volumes in the Library of\r\nCongress re-lettered. A copy of Lord Bacon's \"Sylva Sylvarum\", for\r\nexample, was lettered \"Verlum's Sylva\"--because the sapient binder read\r\non the title-page \"By Baron Verulam\", and it was not his business to find\r\nout that this was the title of honor which Bacon bore; so, by a compound\r\nblunder, he converted Verulam into Verlum, and gave the book to an\r\nunknown writer. This is perhaps an extreme case, but you will find many\r\nto match it. Another folio, Rochefort's History of the Caribby Islands,\r\nwas lettered \"Davies' Carriby Islands,\" because the title bore the\r\nstatement \"Rendered into English by John Davies.\" In another library, the\r\ngreat work of the naturalist, Buffon, was actually lettered \"Buffoon's\r\nNatural History.\" Neither of these blunders was as bad as that of the\r\nowner of an elegant black-letter edition of a Latin classic, which was\r\nprinted without title-page, like most fifteenth century books, and began\r\nat the top of the first leaf, in large letters--\"HOC INCIPIT,\" signifying\r\n\"This begins\", followed by the title or subject of the book. The wiseacre\r\nwho owned it had the book richly bound, and directed it to be lettered on\r\nthe back--\"Works of Hoc Incipit, Rome, 1490.\" This is a true story, and\r\nthe hero of it might perhaps, on the strength of owning so many learned\r\nworks, have passed for a philosopher, if he had not taken the pains to\r\nadvertise himself as a blockhead.\r\n\r\nSome of the commonest blunders are stamping on the back the translator's\r\nor the editor's name, instead of that of the author of the book; putting\r\non adjectives instead of substantives for titles; modernizing ancient and\r\ncharacteristic spelling, found in the title, (the exact orthography of\r\nwhich should always be followed); mixing up the number and the case of\r\nLatin titles, and those in other foreign languages; leaving off entirely\r\nthe name of the writer; and lettering periodicals by putting on the\r\nvolume without the year, or the year, without the number of the volume.\r\n\"No one but an idiot\", said Mr. C. Walford to the London Librarians'\r\nConference, \"would send his books to the binder, without indicating the\r\nlettering he desires on the backs.\" The only safe-guard is for the\r\nlibrarian or owner to prescribe on a written slip in each volume, a title\r\nfor every book, before it goes to the binder, who will be only too glad\r\nto have his own time saved--since time is money to him. I would not\r\nunderrate the book-binders, who are a most worthy and intelligent class,\r\nnumbering in their ranks men who are scholars as well as artists; but\r\nthey are concerned chiefly with the mechanics and not with the\r\nmetaphysics of their art, and moreover, they are not bound by that rigid\r\nrule which should govern the librarian--namely--to have no ignoramus\r\nabout the premises.\r\n\r\nIn writing letterings (for I take it that no one would be guilty of\r\ndefacing his title-pages by marking them up with directions to the\r\nbinder) you should definitely write out the parts of the title as they\r\nare to run on the back of the book, spaced line upon line, and not \"run\r\ntogether.\" I think that the name of the author should always stand first\r\nat the head of the lettering, because it affords the quickest guide to\r\nthe eye in finding any book, as well as in replacing it upon the shelves.\r\nEspecially useful and time-saving is this, where classes of books are\r\narranged in alphabetical sequence. Is not the name of the author commonly\r\nuppermost in the mind of the searcher? Then, let it be uppermost on the\r\nbook sought also. Follow the name of the author by the briefest possible\r\nwords selected from the title which will suffice to characterize the\r\nsubject of the work. Thus, the title--\"On the Origin of Species by means\r\nof Natural Selection\", by Charles Darwin, should be abbreviated into\r\n\r\n                           Darwin\r\n                          --------\r\n                      Origin of Species.\r\n\r\nHere are no superfluous words, to consume the binder's time and\r\ngold-leaf, and to be charged in the bill; or to consume the time of the\r\nbook-searcher, in stopping to read a lot of surplusage on the back of the\r\nbook, before seizing it for immediate use. Books in several volumes\r\nshould have the number of each volume plainly marked in Arabic (not\r\nRoman) numerals on the back. The old-fashioned method of expressing\r\nnumerals by letters, instead of figures, is too cumbrous and\r\ntime-consuming to be tolerated. You want to letter, we will say, vol. 88\r\nof Blackwood's Magazine. If you follow the title-page of that book, as\r\nprinted, you have to write\r\n\r\n\"Volume LXXXVIII,\" eight letters, for the number of the volume, instead\r\nof two simple figures--thus--88.\r\n\r\nNow can any one give a valid reason for the awkward and tedious method of\r\nnotation exhibited in the Roman numerals? If it were only the lost time\r\nof the person who writes it, or the binder's finisher who letters it, it\r\nwould be comparatively insignificant. But think of the time wasted by the\r\nwhole world of readers, who must go through a more or less troublesome\r\nprocess of notation before they get a clear notion of what all this\r\nsuperfluous stuff stands for instead of the quick intuition with which\r\nthey take in the Arabic figures; and who must moreover, by the antiquated\r\nmethod, take valuable time to write out LXXXVIII, eight figures instead\r\nof two, to say nothing of the added liability to error, which increases\r\nin the exact ratio of the number of figures to be written. Which of these\r\ntwo forms of expression is more quickly written, or stamped, or read? By\r\nwhich method of notation will the library messenger boys or girls soonest\r\nfind the book? This leads me to say what cannot be too strongly insisted\r\nupon; all library methods should be time-saving methods, and so devised\r\nfor the benefit alike of the librarian, the assistants, and the readers.\r\nUntil one has learned the supreme value of moments, he will not be fit\r\nfor a librarian. The same method by Arabic numerals only, should be used\r\nin all references to books; and it would be well if the legal fashion of\r\nciting authorities by volume and page, now adopted in most law books,\r\nwere extended to all literature--thus:\r\n\r\n\"3 Macaulay's England, 481. N. Y. 1854,\" instead of \"Macaulay's England,\r\nN. Y. ed. 1854. vol. 3, page 481.\" It is a matter of congratulation to\r\nall librarians, as well as to the reading public, that Poole's Indexes to\r\nPeriodical Literature have wisely adopted Arabic figures only, both for\r\nvolume and page. The valuable time thus saved to all is quite\r\nincalculable.\r\n\r\nEvery book which is leather-bound has its back divided off into panels or\r\nsections, by the band across the back or by the gold or plain fillet or\r\nroll forming part of the finish of the book. These panels are usually\r\nfive or six in number, the former being the more common. Now it is the\r\nlibrarian's function to prescribe in which of these panels the lettering\r\nof the book--especially where there is double lettering--shall go. Thus\r\n\r\n          |   COUSIN   |       |       |      |      |\r\n          |    ----    |       |       |      | NEW  |\r\n     2nd  |  HISTORY   |  4th  | WIGHT | End  |YORK, |\r\n    panel |    OF      | panel |       |      |1852. |\r\n          |  MODERN    |       |       |      |      |\r\n          | PHILOSOPHY.|       |       |      |      |\r\n\r\nMany books, especially dramatic works, and the collected works of authors\r\nrequire the contents of the various volumes to be briefed on the back.\r\nHere is a Shakespeare, for example, in 10 volumes, or a Swift in 19, or\r\nCarlyle in 33, and you want to find _King Lear_, or _Gulliver's Travels_,\r\nor _Heroes and Hero Worship_. The other volumes concern you not--but you\r\nwant the shortest road to these. If the name of each play is briefed by\r\nthe first word upon the different volumes of your Shakespeare, or the\r\ncontents of each volume upon the Swift and the Carlyle,--as they should\r\nbe--you find instantly what you want, with one glance of the eye along\r\nthe backs. If put to the trouble of opening every volume to find the\r\ncontents, or of hunting it in the index, or the library catalogue, you\r\nlose precious time, while readers wait, thus making the needless delay\r\ncumulative, and as it must be often repeated, indefinite.\r\n\r\nEach volume should have its date and place of publication plainly\r\nlettered at the lower end, or what binders term the tail of the book.\r\nThis often saves time, as you may not want an edition of old date, or\r\n_vice versa_, while the place and date enable readers' tickets to be\r\nfilled out quickly without the book. The name of the library might well\r\nbe lettered also on the back, being more obvious as a permanent means of\r\nidentification than the book-plate or inside stamp.\r\n\r\nBooks should never be used when fresh from the binder's hands. The covers\r\nare then always damp, and warp on exposure to air and heat. Unless\r\npressed firmly in shelves, or in piles, for at least two weeks, they may\r\nbecome incurably warped out of shape. Many an otherwise handsomely bound\r\nbook is ruined by neglect of this caution, for once thoroughly dried in\r\nits warped condition, there is no remedy save the costly one of\r\nrebinding.\r\n\r\nBooks are frequently lettered so carelessly that the titles instead of\r\naligning, or being in straight horizontal lines, run obliquely upward or\r\ndownward, thus defacing the volume. Errors in spelling words are also\r\nliable to occur. All crooked lettering and all mistakes in spelling\r\nshould at once be rejected, and the faulty books returned to the binder,\r\nto be corrected at his own expense. This severe revision of all books\r\nwhen newly bound, before they are placed upon the shelves, should be done\r\nby the librarian's or owner's own eye--not entrusted to subordinates,\r\nunless to one thoroughly skilled.\r\n\r\nOne should never receive back books from a binder without collating them,\r\nto see if all are perfect as to pages, and if all plates or maps are in\r\nplace. If deficiencies are found, the binder, and not the library is\r\nresponsible, provided the book was known to be perfect when sent for\r\nbinding.\r\n\r\nIn the Congressional Library I had the periodicals which are analyzed in\r\nPoole's Index of Periodical Literature thoroughly compared and\r\nre-lettered, wherever necessary, to make the series of volumes correspond\r\nwith the references in that invaluable and labor-saving index. For\r\ninstance, the Eclectic Review, as published in London, had eight distinct\r\nand successive series (thus confusing reference by making eight different\r\nvolumes called 1, 2, 3, etc.) each with a different numbering, \"First\r\nseries, 2d series,\" etc., which Poole's Index very properly consolidated\r\ninto one, for convenient reference. By adding the figures as scheduled in\r\nthat work--prefixed by the words _Poole's Index No._ ---- or simply\r\n_Poole_, in small letters, followed by the figure of the volume as given\r\nin that index, you will find a saving of time in hunting and supplying\r\nreferences that is almost incalculable. If you cannot afford to have this\r\nre-numbering done by a binder in gilt letters, it will many times repay\r\nthe cost and time of doing it on thin manila paper titles, written or\r\nprinted by a numbering machine and pasted on the backs of the volumes.\r\n\r\nIn all periodicals,--magazines and serials of every kind,--the covers and\r\ntheir advertisements should be bound in their proper place, with each\r\nmonth or number of the periodical, though it may interrupt the continuity\r\nof the paging. Thus will be preserved valuable contemporary records\r\nrespecting prices, bibliographical information, etc., which should never\r\nbe destroyed, as it is illustrative of the life and history of the\r\nperiod. The covers of the magazines, too, frequently contain the table of\r\ncontents of the number, which of course must be prefixed to it, in order\r\nto be of any use. If advertising pages are very numerous and bulky, (as\r\nin many popular periodicals of late years) they may well be bound at the\r\nend of the volume, or, if so many as to make the volume excessively\r\nthick, they might be bound in a supplementary volume. In all books,\r\nhalf-titles or bastard titles, as they are called, should be bound in, as\r\nthey are a part of the book.\r\n\r\nWith each lot of books to be bound, there should always be sent a sample\r\nvolume of good work as a pattern, that the binder may have no excuse for\r\nhasty or inferior workmanship.\r\n\r\nThe Grolier Club was founded in New York in 1884, having for its objects\r\nto promote the literary study and progress of the arts pertaining to the\r\nproduction of books. It has published more than twenty books in sumptuous\r\nstyle, and mostly in quarto form, the editions being limited to 150\r\ncopies at first, since increased to 300, under the rapidly enlarging\r\nmembership of the Club. Most of these books relate to fine binding, fine\r\nprinting, or fine illustration of books, or are intended to exemplify\r\nthem, and by their means, by lectures, and exhibitions of fine book-work,\r\nthis society has contributed much toward the diffusion of correct taste.\r\nMore care has been bestowed upon fine binding in New York than in London\r\nitself. In fact, elegant book-binding is coming to be recognized as one\r\nof the foremost of the decorative arts.\r\n\r\nThe art of designing book-covers and patterns for gilding books has\r\nengaged the talents of many artists, among whom may be named Edwin A.\r\nAbbey, Howard Pyle, Stanford White, and Elihu Vedder. Nor have skilful\r\ndesigns been wanting among women, as witness Mrs. Whitman's elegant\r\ntea-leaf border for the cover of Dr. O. W. Holmes's \"Over the Tea-cups,\"\r\nand Miss Alice Morse's arabesques and medallions for Lafcadio Hearn's\r\n\"Two Years in the French West Indies.\" Miss May Morris designed many\r\ntasteful letters for the fine bindings executed by Mr. Cobden-Sanderson\r\nof London, and Kate Greenaway's many exquisite little books for little\r\npeople have become widely known for their quaint and curious cover\r\ndesigns. A new field thus opens for skilled cultivators of the beautiful\r\nwho have an eye for the art of drawing.\r\n\r\nMr. William Matthews, the accomplished New York binder, in an address\r\nbefore the Grolier Club in 1895, said: \"I have been astonished that so\r\nfew women--in America, I know none--are encouragers of the art; they\r\ncertainly could not bestow their taste on anything that would do them\r\nmore credit, or as a study, give them more satisfaction.\" It is but fair\r\nto add that since this judgment was put forth, its implied reproach is no\r\nlonger applicable: a number of American women have interested themselves\r\nin the study of binding as a fine art; and some few in practical work as\r\nbinders of books.\r\n\r\nThere is no question that readers take a greater interest in books that\r\nare neatly and attractively bound, than in volumes dressed in a mean\r\ngarb. No book owner or librarian with any knowledge of the incurable\r\ndefects of calf, sheep, or roan leather, if he has any regard for the\r\nusefulness or the economies of his library, will use them in binding\r\nbooks that are to possess permanent value in personal or public use. True\r\neconomy lies in employing the best description of binding in the first\r\ninstance.\r\n\r\nWhen it is considered that the purposed object of book-binding is to\r\npreserve in a shape at once attractive and permanent, the best and\r\nnoblest thoughts of man, it rises to a high rank among the arts. Side by\r\nside with printing, it strives after that perfection which shall ensure\r\nthe perpetuity of human thought. Thus a book, clothed in morocco, is not\r\na mere piece of mechanism, but a vehicle in which the intellectual life\r\nof writers no longer on earth is transmitted from age to age. And it is\r\nthe art of book-binding which renders libraries possible. What the\r\nauthor, the printer, and the binder create, the library takes charge of\r\nand preserves. It is thus that the material and the practical link\r\nthemselves indissolubly with the ideal. And the ideal of every true\r\nlibrarian should be so to care for the embodiments of intelligence\r\nentrusted to his guardianship, that they may become in the highest degree\r\nuseful to mankind. In this sense, the care bestowed upon thorough and\r\nenduring binding can hardly be overrated, since the life of the book\r\ndepends upon it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 4.\r\n\r\nPREPARATION FOR THE SHELVES: BOOK PLATES, ETC.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen any lot of books is acquired, whether by purchase from book-dealers\r\nor from auction, or by presentation, the first step to be taken, after\r\nseeing that they agree with the bill, and have been collated, in\r\naccordance with methods elsewhere given, should be to stamp and label\r\neach volume, as the property of the library. These two processes are\r\nquite distinct, and may be performed by one or two persons, according to\r\nconvenience, or to the library force employed. The stamp may be the\r\nordinary rubber one, inked by striking on a pad, and ink of any color may\r\nbe used, although black or blue ink has the neatest appearance. The stamp\r\nshould bear the name of the library, in clear, legible, plain type, with\r\nyear of acquisition of the book in the centre, followed by the month and\r\nday if desired. A more permanent kind of stamp is the embossing stamp,\r\nwhich is a steel die, the letters cut in relief, but it is very expensive\r\nand slow, requiring the leaf to be inserted between the two parts of the\r\nstamp, though the impression, once made, is practically indelible.\r\n\r\nThe size of the stamp (which is preferably oval in shape) should not\r\nexceed 1¼ to 1½ inches in diameter, as a large, coarse stamp never\r\npresents a neat appearance on a book. Indeed, many books are too small to\r\nadmit any but a stamp of very moderate dimensions. The books should be\r\nstamped on the verso (reverse) of the title page, or if preferred, on the\r\nwidest unprinted portion of the title-page, preferably on the right hand\r\nof the centre, or just below the centre on the right. This, because its\r\nimpression is far more legible on the plain white surface than on any\r\npart of the printed title. In a circulating library, the stamps should be\r\nimpressed on one or more pages in the body of the book, as well as on the\r\nlast page, as a means of identification if the book is stolen or\r\notherwise lost; as it is very easy to erase the impression of a rubber\r\nstamp from the title-page, and thereby commit a fraud by appropriating or\r\nselling the book. In such a case, the duplicate or triplicate impression\r\nof the stamp on some subsequent page (say page 5 or 16, many books having\r\nbut few pages) as fixed upon by the librarian, is quite likely to escape\r\nnotice of the thief, while it remains a safe-guard, enabling the\r\nlibrarian to reclaim the book, wherever found. The law will enforce this\r\nright of free reclamation in favor of a public library, in the case of\r\nstolen books, no matter in what hands found, and even though the last\r\nholder may be an innocent purchaser. All libraries are victimized at some\r\ntime by unscrupulous or dishonest readers, who will appropriate books,\r\nthinking themselves safe from detection, and sometimes easing their\r\nconsciences, (if they have any) by the plea that the book is in a measure\r\npublic property.\r\n\r\nIn these cases, there is no absolute safe-guard, as it is easy to carry\r\noff a book under one's coat, and the librarian and his few aids are far\r\ntoo busy to act as detectives in watching readers. Still, a vigilant\r\nlibrarian will almost always find out, by some suspicious\r\ncircumstance--such as the hiding of books away, or a certain furtive\r\naction observed in a reader--who are the persons that should be watched,\r\nand when it is advisable to call in the policeman.\r\n\r\nThe British Museum Library, which has no circulation or book lending,\r\nenforces a rule that no one making his exit can have a book with him,\r\nunless checked as his own property, all overcoats and other wraps being\r\nof course checked at the door.\r\n\r\nIt is a melancholy fact, duly recorded in a Massachusetts paper, that no\r\nless than two hundred and fifty volumes, duly labeled and stamped as\r\npublic library books, were stolen from a single library in a single year,\r\nand sold to second-hand booksellers.\r\n\r\nThe impression of the stamp in the middle of a certain page, known to the\r\nlibrarian, renders it less liable to detection by others, while if\r\nstamped on the lower unprinted margin, it might be cut out by a designing\r\nperson.\r\n\r\nNext to the stamping, comes the labeling of the books to be added to the\r\nlibrary. This is a mechanical process, and yet one of much importance.\r\nUpon its being done neatly and properly, depends the good or bad\r\nappearance of the library books, as labels with rough or ragged edges, or\r\nput on askew, or trimmed irregularly at their margins, present an ugly\r\nand unfinished aspect, offensive to the eye of good taste, and reflecting\r\ndiscredit on the management. A librarian should take pride in seeing all\r\ndetails of his work carefully and neatly carried out. If he cannot have\r\nperfection, from want of time, he should always aim at it, at least, and\r\nthen only will he come near to achieving it.\r\n\r\nThe label, or book-plate (for they are one and the same thing) should be\r\nof convenient size to go into books both small and large; and a good size\r\nis approximately 2¼ inches wide by 1½ inches high when trimmed. As\r\ncomparatively few libraries care to go to the expense, which is about ten\r\ntimes that of printing, of an engraved label (although such work adds to\r\nthe attractiveness of the books containing it) it should be printed in\r\nclear, not ornamental type, with the name of the library, that of the\r\ncity or town in which it is located (unless forming a part of the title)\r\nand the abbreviation No. for number, with such other spaces for section\r\nmarks or divisions, shelf-marks, etc., as the classification adopted may\r\nrequire. The whole should be enclosed in an ornamental border--not too\r\nornate for good taste.\r\n\r\nThe labels, nicely trimmed to uniform size by a cutting machine, (if that\r\nis not in the library equipment, any binder will do it for you) are next\r\nto be pasted or gummed, as preferred. This process is a nice one,\r\nrequiring patience, care, and practice. Most libraries are full of books\r\nimperfectly labelled, pasted on in crooked fashion, or perhaps damaging\r\nthe end-leaves by an over-use of paste, causing the leaves to adhere to\r\nthe page labelled--which should always be the inside left hand cover of\r\nthe book. This slovenly work is unworthy of a skilled librarian, who\r\nshould not suffer torn waste leaves, nor daubs of over-running paste in\r\nany of his books. To prevent both these blunders in library economy, it\r\nis only needful to instruct any intelligent assistant thoroughly, by\r\npractical example how to do it--accompanied by a counter-example how not\r\nto do it. The way to do it is to have your paste as thin as that used by\r\nbinders in pasting their fly-leaves, or their leather, or about the\r\nconsistency of porridge or pea soup. Then lay the label or book-plate\r\nface downward on a board or table covered with blotting paper, dip your\r\npaste brush (a half inch bristle brush is the best) in the paste, stroke\r\nit (to remove too much adhering matter) on the inner side of your paste\r\ncup, then apply it across the whole surface of the label, with light,\r\neven strokes of the brush, until you see that it is all moistened with\r\npaste. Next, take up the label and lay it evenly in the middle of the\r\nleft inner cover page of the book to be labelled, and with a small piece\r\nof paper (not with the naked fingers) laid over it, stroke it down firmly\r\nin its place, by rubbing over a few times the incumbent paper. This being\r\nproperly done (and it is done by an expert, once learned, very rapidly)\r\nyour book-plate will be firmly and smoothly pasted in, with no exuding\r\nof paste at the edges, to spoil the fly-leaves, and no curling up of\r\nedges because insufficiently pasted down.\r\n\r\nSo much for the book-plate--for the inside of the volumes; now let us\r\nturn attention to the outside label. This is necessarily very much\r\nsmaller than the book-plate: in fact, it should not be larger than\r\nthree-quarters or seven-eighths of an inch in diameter, and even smaller\r\nfor the thinner volumes, while in the case of the very smallest, or\r\nthinnest of books, it becomes necessary to paste the labels on the side,\r\ninstead of on the back. This label is to contain the section and\r\nshelf-mark of the book, marked by plain figures, according to the plan of\r\nclassification adopted. When well done, it is an inexpressible comfort to\r\nany librarian, because it shows at one glance of the eye, and without\r\nopening the book at all, just where in the wide range of the\r\nmiscellaneous library it is to go. Thus the book service of every day is\r\nincalculably aided, and the books are both found when sought on the\r\nshelves, and replaced there, with no trouble of opening them.\r\n\r\nThis outer-label system once established, in strict correspondence with\r\nthe catalogue, the only part of the librarian's work remaining to be\r\nprescribed in this field, concerns the kind of label to be selected, and\r\nthe method of affixing them to the books. The adhesive gummed labels\r\nfurnished by the Library Bureau, or those manufactured by the Dennison\r\nCompany of New York have the requisite qualities for practical use. They\r\nmay be purchased in sheets, or cut apart, as convenient handling may\r\ndictate. Having first written in ink in plain figures, as large as the\r\nlabels will bear, the proper locality marks, take a label moistener (a\r\nhollow tube filled with water, provided with a bit of sponge at the end\r\nand sold by stationers) and wet the label throughout its surface, then\r\nfix it on the back of the book, on the smooth part of the binding near\r\nthe lower end, and with a piece of paper (not the fingers) press it down\r\nfirmly to its place by repeated rubbings. If thoroughly done, the labels\r\nwill not peel off nor curl up at the edges for a long time. Under much\r\nusage of the volumes, however, they must occasionally be renewed.\r\n\r\nWhen the books being prepared for the shelves have all been duly\r\ncollated, labelled and stamped, processes which should precede\r\ncataloguing them, they are next ready for the cataloguer. His functions\r\nhaving been elsewhere described, it need only be said that the books when\r\ncatalogued and handed over to the reviser, (or whoever is to scrutinize\r\nthe titles and assign them their proper places in the library\r\nclassification) are to have the shelf-marks of the card-titles written on\r\nthe inside labels, as well as upon the outside.\r\n\r\nWhen this is done, the title-cards can be withdrawn and alphabeted in the\r\ncatalogue drawers. Next, all the books thus catalogued, labelled, and\r\nsupposed to be ready for the shelves, should be examined with reference\r\nto three points:\r\n\r\n1st. Whether any of the volumes need re-lettering.\r\n\r\n2nd. Whether any of them require re-binding.\r\n\r\n3rd. If any of the bindings are in need of repair.\r\n\r\nIn any lot of books purchased or presented, are almost always to be found\r\nsome that are wrongly or imperfectly lettered on the back. Before these\r\nare ready for the shelves, they should be carefully gone through with,\r\nand all errors or shortcomings corrected. It is needful to send to the\r\nbinder\r\n\r\n1st. All books which lack the name of the author on the back. This should\r\nbe stamped by the binder at the head, if there is room--if not, in the\r\nmiddle panel on the back of the book.\r\n\r\n2nd. All books lettered with mis-spelled words.\r\n\r\n3rd. All volumes in sets, embracing several distinct works--to have the\r\nname of each book in the contents plainly stamped on the outside.\r\n\r\n4th. All books wholly without titles on the back, of which many are\r\npublished--the title being frequently given on the side only, or in the\r\ninterior alone.\r\n\r\n5th. All periodicals having the volume on the back, without the year, to\r\nhave the year lettered; and periodicals having the year, but not the\r\nvolume, are to have the number of the volume added.\r\n\r\nIf these things, all essential to good management and prompt library\r\nservice, are not done before the books go to their shelves, the chances\r\nare that they will not be done at all.\r\n\r\nThe second requisite to be attended to is to examine whether any of the\r\nvolumes catalogued require to be bound or re-bound. In any lot of books\r\nof considerable extent, there will always be some (especially if from\r\nauction sales) dilapidated and shaken, so as to unfit them for use. There\r\nwill be others so soiled in the bindings or the edges as to be positively\r\nshabby, and they should be re-bound to render them presentable.\r\n\r\nThe third point demanding attention is to see what volumes need repair.\r\nIt very often happens that books otherwise pretty well bound have torn\r\ncorners, or rubbed or shop-worn backs, or shabby marbled paper frayed at\r\nthe sides, or some other defect, which may be cured by mending or\r\nfurbishing up, without re-binding. This a skilful binder is always\r\ncompetent to take in charge; and as in the other cases, it should have\r\nattention immediately upon the acquisition of the books.\r\n\r\nAll books coming into a library which contain autographs, book-plates of\r\nformer owners, coats of arms, presentation inscriptions from the author,\r\nmonograms, or other distinguishing features, should preserve them as of\r\ninterest to the present or the future.\r\n\r\nAnd all printed paper covers should be carefully preserved by binding\r\nthem inside the new cover which the book receives, thus preserving\r\nauthentic evidence of the form in which the book was first issued to the\r\npublic, and often its original price. In like manner, when a cloth-bound\r\nbook comes to re-binding, its side and back covers may be bound in at the\r\nend of the book, as showing the style in which it was originally issued,\r\nfrequently displaying much artistic beauty.\r\n\r\nWhoever receives back any books which have been out in circulation,\r\nwhether it be the librarian or assistant, must examine each volume, to\r\nsee if it is in apparent good order. If it is found (as frequently\r\nhappens) that it is shaky and loose, or if leaves are ready to drop out,\r\nor if the cover is nearly off, it should never be allowed to go back to\r\nthe shelves, but laid aside for re-binding or repair with the next lot\r\nsent to the binder. Only prompt vigilance on this point, combined with\r\nthe requirement of speedy return by the binder, will save the loss or\r\ninjury beyond repair of many books. It will also save the patrons of the\r\nlibrary from the frequent inconvenience of having to do without books,\r\nwhich should be on the shelves for their use. How frequent this sending\r\nof books to repair should be, cannot be settled by any arbitrary rule;\r\nbut it would be wise, in the interest of all, to do it as often as two or\r\nthree dozen damaged books are accumulated.\r\n\r\nIf you find other injury to a book returned, than the natural wear and\r\ntear that the library must assume, if a book, for example, is blotched\r\nwith ink, or soiled with grease, or has been so far wet as to be badly\r\nstained in the leaves, or if it is found torn in any part on a hasty\r\ninspection, or if a plate or a map is missing, or the binding is\r\nviolently broken (as sometimes happens) then the damage should be borne\r\nby the reader, and not by the library. This will sometimes require the\r\npurchase of a fresh copy of the book, which no fair-minded reader can\r\nobject to pay, who is favored with the privileges of free enjoyment of\r\nthe treasures of a public library. Indeed, it will be found in the\r\nmajority of cases that honest readers themselves call attention to such\r\ninjuries as books have accidentally received while in their possession,\r\nwith voluntary offer to make good the damage.\r\n\r\nAll unbound or paper covered volumes should be reserved from the shelves,\r\nand not supplied to readers until bound. This rule may be relaxed (as\r\nthere is almost no rule without some valid exception) in the case of a\r\npopular new book, issued only in paper covers, if it is desired to give\r\nan opportunity of early perusal to readers frequenting the library. But\r\nsuch books should not be permitted to circulate, as they would soon be\r\nworn to pieces by handling. Only books dressed in a substantial covering\r\nare fit to be loaned out of any library. In preparing for the bindery any\r\nnew books, or old ones to be re-bound or repaired, lists should be made\r\nof any convenient number set apart for the purpose, prompt return should\r\nbe required, and all should be checked off on the list when returned.\r\n\r\nNo shelf in a well-regulated library should be unprovided with\r\nbook-supports, in order to prevent the volumes from sagging and straining\r\nby falling against one another, in a long row of books. Numerous\r\ndifferent devices are in the market for this purpose, from the solid\r\nbrick to the light sheet-iron support; but it is important to protect the\r\nend of every row from strain on the bindings, and the cost of book\r\nsupports is indefinitely less than that of the re-binding entailed by\r\nneglecting to use them.\r\n\r\nSome libraries of circulation make it a rule to cover all their books\r\nwith paper or thin muslin covers, before they are placed on the shelves\r\nfor use. This method has its advantages and its drawbacks. It doubtless\r\nprotects the bindings from soiling, and where books circulate widely and\r\nlong, no one who has seen how foul with dirt they become, can doubt the\r\nexpediency of at least trying the experiment of clean covers. They should\r\nbe of the firmest thin but tough Manila paper, and it is claimed that\r\ntwenty renewals of clean paper covers actually cost less than one\r\nre-binding. On the other hand, it is not to be denied that books thus\r\ncovered look shabby, monotonous, and uninteresting. In the library used\r\nfor reference and reading only, without circulation, covers are quite out\r\nof place.\r\n\r\nBook-plates having been briefly referred to above, a few words as to\r\ntheir styles and uses may here be pertinent. The name \"book-plate\" is a\r\nclumsy and misleading title, suggesting to the uninitiated the\r\nillustrations or plates which embellish the text of a book. The name _Ex\r\nlibris_, two latin words used for book-plate in all European languages,\r\nis clearer, but still not exact, as a definition of the thing, signifying\r\nsimply \"out of books.\" A book-plate is the owner's or the library's\r\ndistinctive mark of ownership, pasted upon the inside cover, whether it\r\nbe a simple name-label, or an elaborately engraved heraldic or pictorial\r\ndevice. The earliest known book-plates date back to the fifteenth\r\ncentury, and are of German origin, though English plates are known as\r\nearly as 1700. In France, specimens appear for the first time between\r\n1600 and 1650.\r\n\r\nForeign book-plates are, as a rule, heraldic in design, as are also the\r\nearly American plates, representing the coat of arms or family crest of\r\nthe owner of the books, with a motto of some kind. The fashion of\r\ncollecting these owners' marks, as such, irrespective of the books\r\ncontaining them, is a recent and very possibly a passing mania. Still,\r\nthere is something of interest in early American plates, and in those\r\nused by distinguished men, aside from the collector's fad. Some of the\r\nfirst American engravers showed their skill in these designs, and a\r\nsigned and dated plate engraved by Nathaniel Hurd, for example, of\r\nBoston, is of some historic value as an example of early American art. He\r\nengraved many plates about the middle of the last century, and died in\r\n1777. Paul Revere, who was an engraver, designed and executed some few\r\nplates, which are rare, and highly prized, more for his name than for his\r\nskill, for, as generally known, he was a noted patriot of the\r\nRevolutionary period, belonging by his acts to the heroic age of American\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nA book of George Washington's containing his book-plate has an added\r\ninterest, though the plate itself is an armorial design, not at all well\r\nexecuted. Its motto is \"_exitus acta probat_\"--the event justifies the\r\ndeed. From its rarity and the high price it commands, it has probably\r\nbeen the only American book-plate ever counterfeited. At an auction sale\r\nof books in Washington in 1863, this counterfeit plate had been placed in\r\nmany books to give a fictitious value, but the fraud was discovered and\r\nannounced by the present writer, just before the books were sold. Yet the\r\nsale was attended by many attracted to bid upon books said to have been\r\nowned by Washington, and among them the late Dr. W. F. Poole, then\r\nlibrarian of the Boston Athenaeum, which possesses most of the library\r\nauthentically known to have been at Mount Vernon.\r\n\r\nJohn Adams and John Quincy Adams used book-plates, and James Monroe and\r\nJohn Tyler each had a plain name-label. These are all of our presidents\r\nknown to have used them, except General Garfield, who had a printed\r\nbook-plate of simple design, with the motto \"_inter folia fructus_.\"\r\nEleven of the signers of the Declaration of Independence are known to\r\nhave had these signs of gentle birth--for in the early years of the\r\nAmerican Colonies, it was only the families of aristocratic connection\r\nand scholarly tastes who indulged in what may be termed a superfluous\r\nluxury.\r\n\r\nThe plates used among the Southern settlers were generally ordered from\r\nEngland, and not at all American. The Northern plates were more\r\nfrequently of native design and execution, and therefore of much greater\r\nvalue and interest, though far inferior in style of workmanship and\r\nelaboration of ornament to the best European ones.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary library label is also a book-plate, and some of the early\r\nlibraries and small collections have elaborate designs. The early Harvard\r\nCollege library plate was a large and fine piece of engraving by Hurd.\r\nThe Harvard Library had some few of this fine engraved label printed in\r\nred ink, and placed in the rarer books of the library--as a reminder that\r\nthe works containing the rubricated book-plates were not to be drawn out\r\nby students.\r\n\r\nThe learned bibliophile and librarian of Florence, Magliabecchi, who died\r\nin 1714, devised for his library of thirty thousand volumes, which he\r\nbequeathed to the Grand Duke of Tuscany, a book-plate representing his\r\nown profile on a medal surrounded with books and oak boughs, with the\r\ninscription--\"Antonius Magliabecchius Florentinus.\"\r\n\r\nSome book-plates embody designs of great beauty. The late George\r\nBancroft's, engraved on copper, represented a winged cherub (from\r\nRaphael) gazing sun-ward, holding a tablet with the inscription \"_Eis\r\nphaos_,\" toward the light.\r\n\r\nSome French book-plates aim at humor or caricature. One familiar example\r\nrepresents an old book-worm mounted on a tall ladder in a library,\r\nprofoundly absorbed in reading, and utterly unconscious that the room\r\nbeneath him is on fire.\r\n\r\nTo those who ask of what possible utility it can be to cultivate so\r\nunfruitful a pursuit as the devising or the collecting of book-plates, it\r\nmay be pertinent to state the claim made in behalf of the amateurs of\r\nthis art, by a connoisseur, namely, \"Book-plates foster the study of art,\r\nhistory, genealogy, and human character.\" On this theory, we may add, the\r\ncoat of arms or family crest teaches heraldry; the mottoes or\r\ninscriptions chosen cultivate the taste for language and sententious\r\nliterature; the engraving appeals to the sense of the artistic; the names\r\nof early or ancient families who are often thus commemorated teach\r\nbiography, history, or genealogy; while the great variety of sentiments\r\nselected for the plates illustrate the character and taste of those\r\nselecting them.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it must be said that the coat of arms fails to\r\nindicate individual taste or genius, and might better be supplanted by\r\noriginal and characteristic designs, especially such as relate to books,\r\nlibraries, and learning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 5.\r\n\r\nTHE ENEMIES OF BOOKS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have seen in former chapters how the books of a library are acquired,\r\nhow they are prepared for the shelves, or for use, and how they are or\r\nshould be bound. Let us now consider the important questions which\r\ninvolve the care, the protection, and the preservation of the books.\r\n\r\nEvery librarian or book owner should be something more than a custodian\r\nof the books in his collection. He should also exercise perpetual\r\nvigilance with regard to their safety and condition. The books of every\r\nlibrary are beset by dangers and by enemies. Some of these are open and\r\npalpable; others are secret, illusive, little suspected, and liable to\r\ncome unlooked for and without warning. Some of these enemies are\r\nimpersonal and immaterial, but none the less deadly; others are\r\npersonally human in form, but most inhuman in their careless and brutal\r\ntreatment of books. How far and how fatally the books of many libraries\r\nhave been injured by these ever active and persistent enemies can never\r\nbe adequately told. But we may point out what the several dangers are\r\nwhich beset them, and how far the watchful care of the librarian and his\r\nassistants may fore-stall or prevent them.\r\n\r\nOne of the foremost of the inanimate enemies of books is dust. In some\r\nlibraries the atmosphere is dust-laden, to a degree which seems\r\nincredible until you witness its results in the deposits upon books,\r\nwhich soil your fingers, and contaminate the air you breathe, as you\r\nbrush or blow it away. Peculiarly liable to dust are library rooms\r\nlocated in populous towns, or in business streets, and built close to\r\nthe avenues of traffic. Here, the dust is driven in at the windows and\r\ndoors by every breeze that blows. It is an omnipresent evil, that cannot\r\nbe escaped or very largely remedied. As preventive measures, care should\r\nbe taken not to build libraries too near the street, but to have ample\r\nfront and side yards to isolate the books as far as may be consistent\r\nwith convenient access. Where the library is already located immediately\r\non the street, a subscription for sprinkling the thoroughfare with water,\r\nthe year round, would be true economy.\r\n\r\nIn some cities, the evils of street dust are supplemented by the\r\nmischiefs of coal smoke, to an aggravated degree. Wherever soft coal is\r\nburned as the principal fuel, a black, fuliginous substance goes floating\r\nthrough the air, and soils every thing it touches. It penetrates into\r\nhouses and public buildings, often intensified by their own interior use\r\nof the same generator of dirt, and covers the books of the library with\r\nits foul deposits. You may see, in the public libraries of some western\r\ncities, how this perpetual curse of coal smoke has penetrated the leaves\r\nof all the books, resisting all efforts to keep it out, and slowly but\r\nsurely deteriorating both paper and bindings. Here, preventive measures\r\nare impossible, unless some device for consuming the coal smoke of\r\nchimneys and factories were made compulsory, or the evil somewhat\r\nmitigated by using a less dangerous fuel within the library.\r\n\r\nBut, aside from these afflictions of dust, in its most aggravated form,\r\nevery library and every room in any building is subject to its persistent\r\nvisitations. Wherever carpets or rugs cover the floors, there dust has an\r\nassured abiding-place, and it is diffused throughout the apartment in\r\nimpalpable clouds, at every sweeping of the floors. Hence it would be\r\nwise to adopt in public libraries a floor-covering like linoleum, or some\r\nsubstance other than woolen, which would be measurably free from dust,\r\nwhile soft enough to deaden the sound of feet upon the floors. Even with\r\nthis preventive precaution, there will always be dust enough, and too\r\nmuch for comfort, or for the health of the books. Only a thorough\r\ndusting, carried on if possible daily, can prevent an accumulation of\r\ndust, at once deleterious to the durability of the books, and to the\r\ncomfort both of librarians and readers. Dust is an insidious foe,\r\nstealing on its march silently and unobserved, yet, however impalpable in\r\nthe atmosphere of a library, it will settle upon the tops of every shelf\r\nof books, it will penetrate their inner leaves, it will lodge upon the\r\nbindings, soiling books and readers, and constituting a perpetual\r\nannoyance.\r\n\r\nIt is not enough to dust the tops of the books periodically; a more full\r\nand radical remedy is required, to render library books presentable. At\r\nno long intervals, there should be a thorough library cleaning, as\r\ndrastic and complete as the house-cleaning which neat housewives\r\ninstitute twice a year, with such wholesome results. The books are to be\r\ntaken down from the shelves, and subjected to a shaking-up process, which\r\nwill remove more of the dust they have absorbed than any brush can reach.\r\nTo do this effectually, take them, if of moderate thickness, by the\r\nhalf-dozen at a time from the shelf, hold them loosely on a table, their\r\nfronts downward, backs uppermost, then with a hand at either side of the\r\nlittle pile, strike them smartly together a few times, until the dust,\r\nwhich will fly from them in a very palpable cloud, ceases to fall. Then\r\nlay them on their ends, with the tops uppermost on the table, and repeat\r\nthe concussion in that posture, when you will eliminate a fresh crop of\r\ndust, though not so thick as the first. After this, let each volume of\r\nthe lot be brushed over at the sides and back with a soft (never stiff)\r\nbrush, or else with a piece of cotton or woolen cloth, and so restored\r\nclean to the shelves. While this thorough method of cleansing will take\r\ntime and pains, it will pay in the long run. It will not eliminate all\r\nthe dust (which in a large collection is a physical impossibility) but it\r\nwill reduce it to a minimum. Faithfully carried out, as a periodical\r\nsupplement to a daily dusting of the books as they stand on the shelves,\r\nit will immensely relieve the librarian or book-owner, who can then, (and\r\nthen only) feel that he has done his whole duty by his books.\r\n\r\nAnother dangerous enemy of the library book is damp, already briefly\r\nreferred to. Books kept in any basement room, or near any wall, absorb\r\nmoisture with avidity; both paper and bindings becoming mildewed, and\r\noften covered with blue mould. If long left in this perilous condition,\r\nsure destruction follows; the glue or paste which fastens the cover\r\nsoftens, the leather loses its tenacity, and the leaves slowly rot, until\r\nthe worthless volumes smell to heaven. Books thus injured may be\r\npartially recovered, before the advanced stage of decomposition, by\r\nremoval to a dry atmosphere, and by taking the volumes apart, drying the\r\nsheets, and rebinding--a very expensive, but necessary remedy, provided\r\nthe books are deemed worth preserving.\r\n\r\nBut a true remedy is the preventive one. No library should ever be kept,\r\neven in part, in a basement story, nor should any books ever be located\r\nnear the wall of a building. All walls absorb, retain, and give out\r\nmoisture, and are dangerous and oft-times fatal neighbors to books. Let\r\nthe shelves be located at right angles to every wall--with the end\r\nnearest to it at least twelve to eighteen inches removed, and the danger\r\nwill be obviated.\r\n\r\nA third enemy of the book is heat. Most libraries are unfortunately\r\nover-heated,--sometimes from defective means of controlling the\r\ntemperature, and sometimes from carelessness or want of thought in the\r\nattendant. A high temperature is very destructive to books. It warps\r\ntheir covers, so that volumes unprotected by their fellows, or by a book\r\nsupport, tend to curl up, and stay warped until they become a nuisance.\r\nIt also injures the paper of the volumes by over-heating, and weakening\r\nthe tenacity of the leaves held together by the glue on the back, besides\r\ndrying to an extreme the leather, till it cracks or crumbles under the\r\nheat. The upper shelves or galleries of any library are most seriously\r\naffected by over-heating, because the natural law causes the heat to rise\r\ntoward the ceiling. If you put your hand on some books occupying the\r\nhighest places in some library rooms, in mid-winter, when the fires are\r\nkept at their maximum, the heat of the volume will almost burn your\r\nfingers. If these books were sentient beings, and could speak, would they\r\nnot say--\"our sufferings are intolerable?\"\r\n\r\nThe remedy is of course a preventive one; never to suffer the library to\r\nbecome over-heated, and to have proper ventilation on every floor,\r\ncommunicating with the air outside. Seventy degrees Fahrenheit is a safe\r\nand proper maximum temperature for books and librarian.\r\n\r\nThe mischief arising from gas exhalations is another serious source of\r\ndanger to books. In many well-lighted libraries, the heat itself from the\r\nnumerous gas-burners is sufficient to injure them, and there is besides a\r\nsulphuric acid escaping from the coal-gas fluid, in combustion, which is\r\nmost deleterious to bindings. The only remedy appears to be, where\r\nlibraries are open evenings, to furnish them with electric lights. This\r\nimproved mode of illumination is now so perfected, and so widely\r\ndiffused, that it may be reckoned a positive boon to public libraries, in\r\nsaving their books from one of their worst and most destructive enemies.\r\n\r\nAnother of the potent enemies of books is fire. I refer, not to\r\nover-heating the rooms they occupy, but to the risk they continually run,\r\nin most libraries, of total destruction. The chronicle of burned\r\nlibraries would make a long and melancholy record, on which there is no\r\nspace here to enter. Irreparable losses of manuscripts and early printed\r\nbooks, and precious volumes printed in small editions, have arisen from\r\nmen's neglect of building our book-repositories fire-proof. In all\r\nlibraries not provided with iron or steel shelves, there is perpetual\r\ndanger. Books do not burn easily, unless surrounded with combustibles,\r\nbut these are furnished in nearly all libraries, by surrounding the books\r\non three sides with wooden shelves, which need only to be ignited at any\r\npoint to put the whole collection in a blaze. Then follows the usual\r\nabortive endeavor to save the library by the aid of fire engines, which\r\nflood the building, until the water spoils nearly all which the fire does\r\nnot consume. The incalculable losses which the cause of learning has\r\nsustained from the burning of public, university and ecclesiastical\r\nlibraries are far greater than the cost which the provision of fire-proof\r\nrepositories would have entailed.\r\n\r\nOf late years, there has been a partial reform in library construction.\r\nSome have been built fire-proof throughout, with only stone, brick,\r\nconcrete and iron material, even to the floors and window casings. Many\r\nmore have had iron shelves and iron stacks to hold the shelves\r\nconstructed, and there are now several competing manufacturers of these\r\ninvaluable safeguards to books. The first library interior constructed\r\nwholly of iron was that of the Library of Congress at Washington, which\r\nhad been twice consumed, first when the Capitol was burned by the British\r\narmy in 1814, and again in 1851, through a defective flue, when only\r\n20,000 volumes were saved from the flames, out of a total of 55,000. The\r\nexample of iron construction has been slowly followed, until now the\r\nlarge cities have most of their newly-constructed libraries approximately\r\nfire-proof, although many are exposed to fire in parts, owing to a\r\nniggardly and false economy. The lesson that what is worth doing at all\r\nis worth doing well, and that every neglect of security brings sooner or\r\nlater irreparable loss, is very slowly learned. Whole hecatombs of books\r\nhave been sacrificed to the spirit of commercial greed, blind or\r\nshort-sighted enough not to see that secure protection to public\r\nproperty, though costlier at first, is far cheaper in the end. You may\r\nspeak of insurance against library losses by fire, but what insurance\r\ncould restore the rare and costly Shakespearean treasures of the\r\nBirmingham Free Library, or the unique and priceless manuscripts that\r\nwent up in flames in the city library of Strasburg, in 1870, or the many\r\nprecious and irreplaceable manuscript archives of so many of our States,\r\nburned in the conflagration of their capitols?\r\n\r\nOne would think that the civilized world had had lessons enough, ever\r\nsince that seventh century burning of the Alexandrian library by the\r\nCaliph Omar, with that famous but apocryphal rhetorical dilemma, put in\r\nhis mouth perhaps by some nimble-witted reporter:--\"If these books agree\r\nwith the Koran, they are useless, and should be burned: if not, they are\r\npernicious, and must not be spared.\" But the heedless world goes\r\ncarelessly on, deaf to the voice of reason, and the lessons of history,\r\namid the holocausts of literature and the wreck of blazing libraries,\r\nuttering loud newspaper wails at each new instance of destruction,\r\nforgotten in a week, then cheerfully renewing the business of building\r\nlibraries that invite the flames.\r\n\r\nNothing here said should be interpreted as advice not to insure any\r\nlibrary, in all cases where it is not provided with iron cases for the\r\nbooks, or a fire-proof building. On the contrary, the menaced destruction\r\nof books or manuscripts that cannot be replaced should lead to securing\r\nmeans in advance for replacing all the rest in case of loss by fire. And\r\nthe experience of the past points the wisdom of locating every library in\r\nan isolated building, where risks of fire from other buildings are\r\nreduced to a minimum, instead of in a block whose buildings (as in most\r\ncommercial structures) are lined with wood.\r\n\r\nYou will perhaps attach but small importance at first thought, to the\r\nnext insidious foe to library books that I shall name--that is, wetting\r\nby rain. Yet most buildings leak at the roof, sometime, and some old\r\nbuildings are subject to leaks all the time. Even under the roof of the\r\nCapitol at Washington, at every melting of a heavy snow-fall, and on\r\noccasion of violent and protracted rains, there have been leaks pouring\r\ndown water into the libraries located in the old part of the building.\r\nEach of these saturated and injured its quota of books, some of which\r\ncould only be restored to available use by re-binding, and even then the\r\nleaves were left water-stained in part. See to it that your library roof\r\nis water-tight, or the contents of your library will be constantly\r\nexposed to damage against which there is no insurance.\r\n\r\nAnother besetting danger to the books of our libraries arises from\r\ninsects and vermin. These animated foes appear chiefly in the form of\r\nbook-worms, cockroaches, and mice. The first-named is rare in American\r\nlibraries, though its ravages have extended far and wide among the old\r\nEuropean ones. This minute little insect, whose scientific name is the\r\n_anobium paniceum_, bores through the leaves of old volumes, making\r\nsometimes holes which deface and mutilate the text. All our public\r\nlibraries, doubtless, have on their shelves old folios in vellum or\r\nleather bindings, which present upon opening the disagreeable vision of\r\nleaves eaten through (usually before they crossed the sea) by these\r\npernicious little borers. It is comforting to add, that I have never\r\nknown of any book-worm in the Congressional Library--except the human\r\nvariety, which is frequently in evidence. Georgetown College library once\r\nsent me a specimen of the insect, which was found alive in one of its\r\nvolumes, but the united testimony of librarians is that this pest is rare\r\nin the United States. As to remedies, the preventive one of sprinkling\r\nthe shelves twice a year with a mixture of powdered camphor and snuff, or\r\nthe vapor of benzine or carbolic acid, or other repellant chemicals, is\r\nresorted to abroad, but I have not heard of any similar practice in this\r\ncountry. I may remark in passing, that the term \"book-worm\" is a\r\nmisnomer, since it is not a worm at all, but an insect. A more serious\r\ninsect menace is the cockroach, a hungry, unclean little beast, which\r\nfrequents a good many libraries, and devours bindings (especially fresh\r\nones) to get at the paste or savory parts of the binding. The remedy for\r\nthis evil, when once found to exist, is to scatter the most effective\r\nroach poison that can be found, which may arrest further ravages.\r\n\r\nAnother insect pest is the Croton bug, (_Blatta Germanica_) which eats\r\ninto cloth bindings to get at the sizing or albumen. The late eminent\r\nentomologist, Dr. C. V. Riley, pronounced them the worst pest known in\r\nlibraries, but observed that they do not attack books bound in leather,\r\nand confine their ravages to the outside of cloth-bound books, never\r\ntroubling the leaves. The remedy prescribed is a powder in which\r\npyrethrum is the chief ingredient, sprinkled about the shelves.\r\n\r\nAmong the rodents, mice are apt to be busy and mischievous infesters of\r\nlibraries. They are extremely fond of paste, and being in a chronic\r\nstate of hunger, they watch opportunities of getting at any library\r\nreceptacle of it. They will gnaw any fresh binding, whether of cloth,\r\nboard, or leather, to get at the coveted food. They will also gnaw some\r\nbooks, and even pamphlets, without any apparent temptation of a succulent\r\nnature. A good library cat or a series of mouse traps, skilfully baited,\r\nmay rid you of this evil.\r\n\r\nThe injury that comes to library books from insufficient care in\r\nprotecting them on the shelves is great and incalculable. There are to be\r\nseen in every library, volumes all twisted out of shape by the sagging or\r\nleaning, to which the end-book is subjected, and which is often shared by\r\nall its neighbors on the shelf. The inevitable result is that the book is\r\nnot only spoiled in its good looks, but (which is vastly more important)\r\nit is injured in its binding, which is strained and weakened just in\r\nproportion to the length of time in which it is subjected to such risks.\r\nThe plain remedy is to take care that every volume is supported upright\r\nupon the shelf, in some way. When the shelf is full, the books will\r\nsupport one another. But when volumes are withdrawn, or when a shelf is\r\nonly partly filled with books, the unsupported volumes tumble by force of\r\ngravitation, and those next them sag and lean, or fall like a row of\r\nbricks, pushing one another over. No shelf of books can safely be left in\r\nthis condition. Some one of the numerous book-supports that have been\r\ncontrived should be always ready, to hold up the volumes which are liable\r\nto lean and fall.\r\n\r\nWe come now to the active human enemies of books, and these are unhappily\r\nfound among some of the readers who frequent our libraries. These abuses\r\nare manifold and far-reaching. Most of them are committed through\r\nignorance, and can be corrected by the courteous but firm interposition\r\nof the librarian, instructing the delinquent how to treat a book in hand.\r\nOthers are wilful and unpardonable offences against property rights and\r\npublic morals, even if not made penal offences by law. One of these is\r\nbook mutilation, very widely practiced, but rarely detected until the\r\nmischief is done, and the culprit gone. I have found whole pages torn out\r\nof translations, in the volumes of Bohn's Classical Library, doubtless by\r\nstudents wanting the translated text as a \"crib\" in their study of the\r\noriginal tongue. Some readers will watch their opportunity, and mutilate\r\na book by cutting out plates or a map, to please their fancy, or perhaps\r\nto make up a defective copy of the same work. Those consulting bound\r\nfiles of newspapers will ruthlessly despoil them by cutting out articles\r\nor correspondence, or advertisements, and carrying off the stolen\r\nextracts, to save themselves the trouble of copying. Others, bolder\r\nstill, if not more unscrupulous, will deliberately carry off a library\r\nbook under a coat, or in a pocket, perhaps signing a false name to a\r\nreader's ticket to hide the theft, or escape detection. Against these\r\nscandalous practices, there is no absolute safeguard in any library. Even\r\nwhere a police watch is kept, thefts are perpetrated, and in most\r\nlibraries where no watchman is employed, the librarian and his assistants\r\nare commonly far too busy to exercise close scrutiny of all readers. As\r\none safeguard, no rare or specially costly book should be entrusted to a\r\nreader except under the immediate eye of the librarian or assistant.\r\nOrdinary books can be replaced if carried off, and by watching the\r\nrarities, risk of theft can be reduced to a minimum.\r\n\r\nWhen newspapers are given out to readers, it should always be in a part\r\nof the library where those using them are conscious of a surveillance\r\nexercised over their movements. The penalty of neglecting this may at any\r\ntime be the mutilation of an important file, and it must be remembered\r\nthat such damage, once done, cannot be repaired. You can replace a\r\nmutilated book usually by buying a new one, but a newspaper can almost\r\nnever be replaced. Even in the city of Boston, the librarian of the\r\nAthenaeum library records the disgraceful fact, that \"the temptation to\r\navoid the trouble of copying, by cutting out articles from newspapers is\r\ntoo strong for the honesty of a considerable part of the public.\" And it\r\nwas recorded by the custodian of a public library in Albany that all the\r\nplates were missing from certain books, that the poetry and best\r\nillustrations were cut from magazines before they had lain on the tables\r\na week, and strange to say, that many of these depredations were\r\ncommitted by women.\r\n\r\nIt is a difficult problem how to prevent such outrages to decency, and\r\nsuch irreparable depredations on the books in our libraries as destroy,\r\nin great part, their value. A posted notice, reminding readers that\r\nmutilation of books or periodicals is a penal offence, will warn off\r\nmany, if not all, from such acts of vandalism. If there is no law\r\npunishing the offence, agitate until you get one. Expose through the\r\npress such thefts and mutilations as are discovered. Interest readers\r\nwhom you know, to be watchful of those you do not know, and to quietly\r\nreport any observed violation of rules. When a culprit is detected, push\r\nthe case to prompt legal hearing, and let the penalty of the law be\r\nenforced. Let it be known that the public property in books is too sacred\r\na right to be violated with impunity. Inculcate by every means and on\r\nevery opportunity the sentiment that readers who freely benefit by the\r\nbooks supplied should themselves feel personal concern in their\r\ncleanliness and preservation, and that the interest of the library is\r\nreally the interest of all.\r\n\r\nA daily abuse practiced by many readers in libraries, though without\r\nwrongful intent, is the piling of one book on top of another while open.\r\nThis is inexcusable ill-treatment, for it subjects the open book thus\r\nburdened, to injury, besides probably soiling its pages with dust.\r\nEspecially harmful is such careless treatment of large volumes of\r\nnewspapers or illustrated works.\r\n\r\nCareless use of ink is the cause of much injury to library books. As a\r\nrule (to which the very fewest exceptions should be made) pencils only\r\nshould be allowed to readers, who must forego the use of ink, with the\r\ninevitable risk of dropping it upon the book to its irreparable injury.\r\nThe use of ink in fountain pens is less objectionable. Tracing of maps or\r\nplates should not be allowed, unless with a soft pencil. Under no\r\ncircumstances should tracing with a pen or other hard instrument be\r\npermitted to any reader. Failure to enforce this rule may result in ruin\r\nof valuable engravings or maps.\r\n\r\nThere is one class of books which demand special and watchful care at the\r\nhands of the librarian. These are the fine illustrated works, mostly in\r\nlarge folio, which include the engravings of the art galleries of Europe,\r\nand many other specially rare or costly publications. These should be\r\ncarefully shelved in cases where they can lie on their sides, not placed\r\nupright, as in some collections, to lean over, and, sooner or later to\r\nbreak their backs, and necessitate rebinding. When supplied to readers,\r\nthere should not be more than one volume at a time given out, to avoid\r\nthe risk, always threatening, of careless handling or of opening one\r\nvolume on top of another that is open. There should also be a printed\r\nnotice or label affixed to the side cover of every illustrated work\r\nreading, \"Never touch an engraving,\" or an equivalent warning. This will\r\ngo far, by its plain reminder, to prevent soiling the pages by the\r\nfingers, a practice which rapidly deteriorates fine books, and if long\r\ncontinued, renders them unfit to be exhibited to clean-handed readers.\r\n\r\nAll plates should be stamped at some portion of their surface (it is\r\noften done on the back) with the embossing stamp of the library, as a\r\nmeans of identification if abstracted from the volume to which they\r\nbelong.\r\n\r\nSuch books should, moreover, be consulted on a large table, or better an\r\nadjustable stand (to avoid frequent lifting or shifting of the position\r\nof the volume when inspecting the plates) and always under the eye of the\r\nlibrarian or an assistant not far removed. These precautions will insure\r\nfar more careful treatment, and will result in handing down to a new\r\ngeneration of readers many a rare and precious volume, which would\r\notherwise be destroyed or irretrievably injured in a very few years. The\r\nlibrary treasures which cost so much to bring together should never be\r\npermitted to suffer from want of care to preserve them.\r\n\r\nAll writing upon the margins of books should be prohibited--other than\r\nsimple pencil corrections of the text, as to an erroneous date, name,\r\netc., which corrections of errors should not only be permitted, but\r\nwelcomed, upon due verification. The marking of passages for copying or\r\ncitation should be tolerated only upon the rigid condition that every\r\nuser of the book rubs out his own pencil marks before returning it. I\r\nhave seen lawyers and others thoughtless enough of right and wrong to\r\nmark long passages in pen and ink in books belonging to public libraries.\r\nThis is a practice to be sternly repressed, even at the cost of denying\r\nfurther library privileges to the offender.\r\n\r\nTurning down leaves in a book to keep the place is one of the easily\r\nbesetting sins of too many readers. Those who thus dogs-ear a volume\r\nshould be taught that the vile practice weakens and wears out the leaves\r\nthus folded down, and makes the book a more easy prey to dust and\r\ndisintegration. However busy I may be, I instinctively turn back every\r\nturned-down leaf I notice in any book, before using it, or handing it to\r\nanother. A good safe-guard would be to provide a supply of little narrow\r\nstrips of paper, in the ticket boxes at the library tables to serve as\r\nthe book-markers so frequently needed by readers. For this purpose, no\r\nthick or smooth calendered paper should be used, which falls out of any\r\nloosely bound book too readily--but a thin soft paper un-sized, which\r\nwill be apt to retain its place. I have lost valuable time (which I shall\r\nnever see again) in trying to find the pages marked for me by a searcher\r\nwho had thoughtlessly inserted bits of card-board as markers--which kept\r\nfalling out by their own weight. The book-marks should be at least two\r\ninches long, and not more than half an inch wide; and rough edges are\r\nbetter than smooth ones, for they will adhere better to the head of the\r\nvolume where placed. Better still it is, to provide paper book-marks\r\nforked at the lower end by slitting, then doubled so that the mark will\r\ngo on both sides of the leaf at once. This is the only sure safe-guard\r\nagainst these bits of paper falling out, and thus losing the place. Never\r\nput cards, or letters, or documents, or any solid substance into a book.\r\nIt weakens the binding, and if continued, often breaks the back. The fact\r\nthat most of the injuries to which books are exposed are unintentional\r\ninjuries does not alter the fact that they are none the less injuries to\r\nbe guarded against. Wilful perpetration of the many abuses referred to\r\nmay be rare, but the unconscious perpetrators should be instructed how to\r\nuse books by a vigilant librarian. And they who have thus been taught to\r\nbe careful of the books in a public library will learn to be more careful\r\nof their own, which is a great step in the education of any one.\r\n\r\nIt ought not to be needful to charge any one never to wet the finger to\r\nturn over the leaves of a book--a childish habit, akin to running out the\r\ntongue when writing, or moving the lips when reading to one's self. The\r\nonly proper way to turn the leaf is at the upper right-hand corner, and\r\nthe index-finger of the right hand will always be found competent to that\r\nduty.\r\n\r\nStill less should it be needful to insist upon the importance to every\r\nreader of books, of coming to their perusal clean-handed. When you\r\nreflect that nine-tenths of the soiling and spoiling which books undergo\r\ncomes from the dirty hands of many readers, this becomes a vital point.\r\nFouquet, a learned book collector of France, used to keep a pile of white\r\ngloves in the ante-room of his library, and no visitor was allowed to\r\ncross the threshold, or to handle a book without putting on a pair, lest\r\nhe should soil the precious volumes with naked hands. Such a refinement\r\nof care to keep books immaculate is not to be expected in this age of the\r\nworld; and yet, a librarian who respects his calling is often tempted to\r\nwish that there were some means of compelling people to be more careful\r\nabout books than they are.\r\n\r\nIt ought not ever to be true that an enemy to the welfare of library\r\nbooks is found in the librarian himself, or in any of his assistants, yet\r\nthere have been those employed in the care of books who have abused their\r\npositions and the volumes entrusted to their charge, not only by neglect\r\nof care, (which is a negative injury) but by positive and continual ill\r\ntreatment. This may arise from ignorance of better methods, but ignorance\r\nis a poor excuse for one credited with the intelligence of a librarian.\r\nIn some libraries, books are treated with positive indignity, and are\r\npermanently injured by tightly wedging them together. Never crowd books\r\nby main force into shelves too short or too small for them. It strains\r\nthe backs, and seriously injures the bindings. Every book should slip\r\neasily past its fellows on the shelf. If a volume is too tall to go in\r\nits place, it should be relegated to lower shelves for larger books,\r\nnever letting its head be crowded against the shelf above it.\r\n\r\nOne should never pull books out from the shelf by their head-bands, or by\r\npulling at the binding, but place the finger firmly on the top of the\r\nbook, next to the binding, and press down while drawing out the volume.\r\nFrom failure to observe this simple precaution, you will find in all\r\nlibraries multitudes of torn or broken bindings at the top--a wholly\r\nneedless defacement and waste.\r\n\r\nNever permit a book to be turned down on its face to keep the place. This\r\neasily besetting habit weakens the book, and frequently soils its leaves\r\nby contact with a dusty table. For the same reason, one volume should not\r\nbe placed within the leaves of another to keep the place where a\r\nbook-mark of paper, so easily supplied, should always be used. Books\r\nshould not be turned down on the fore-edges or fronts on the library\r\ntables, as practiced in most book-stores, in order to better display the\r\nstock. The same habit prevails in many libraries, from careless\r\ninattention. When necessary, in order to better read the titles, they\r\nshould never be left long in such position. This treatment weakens the\r\nback infallibly, and if long continued breaks it. Librarians, of all\r\npersons in the world, should learn, and should lead others to learn,\r\nnever to treat a book with indignity, and how truly the life of a book\r\ndepends upon proper treatment, as well as that of an animated being.\r\n\r\nThese things, and others of my suggestions, may seem trifles to some; but\r\nto those who consider how much success in life depends upon attention to\r\nwhat are called trifles--nay, how much both human taste and human\r\nhappiness are promoted by care regarding trifles, they will not appear\r\nunimportant. The existence of schools to teach library science, and of\r\nmanuals devoted to similar laudable aims, is an auspicious omen of the\r\nnew reign of refined taste in those nobler arts of life which connect\r\nthemselves with literature, and are to be hailed as authentic evidences\r\nof the onward progress of civilization.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 6.\r\n\r\nTHE RESTORATION AND RECLAMATION OF BOOKS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are now to consider carefully the restoration and the reclamation of\r\nthe books of a library, whether public or private.\r\n\r\nNothing can be more important than the means of restoring or reclaiming\r\nlibrary books that are lost or injured, since every such restoration will\r\nsave the funds of the library or collector from replacing them with fresh\r\nor newly bought copies, and will enable it to furnish its stores with as\r\nmany new books as the money thus saved represents. The cardinal thing to\r\nbe kept always in view is a wise economy of means. An every-day prudence\r\nis the price of successful administration. A management which permits any\r\nof the enemies of books to destroy or damage them, thereby wasting the\r\nsubstance of the library without repair, is a fatally defective\r\nmanagement, which should be changed as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nThis consideration assumes added importance when it is remembered that\r\nthe means of nearly all our libraries are very limited and inadequate to\r\nthe drafts upon them, year by year. A great many libraries are compelled\r\nto let their books needing rebinding accumulate, from the mere want of\r\nmoney to pay for reclothing the nearly worn-out volumes, thus depriving\r\nthe readers for a considerable time, of the use of many coveted books.\r\nAnd even with those which have large means, I have never yet heard of a\r\nlibrary that had enough, either to satisfy the eager desire of the\r\nlibrarian to fill up deficiencies, or to meet fully the manifold wants of\r\nreaders. So much the more important, then, is it to husband every dollar\r\nthat can be saved, to keep the books in such good condition that they\r\nwill not need frequent rebinding, and to reduce to a minimum all the\r\nevils which beset them, menacing their safety, or injuring their\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nTo attain these great ends, the librarian who is qualified for his\r\nresponsible position, must be both a preserver and a restorer of books.\r\nIf not personally able to go through the mechanical processes which\r\nbelong to the art of restoration, (and this is the case in all libraries\r\nexcept the smallest) he should at least learn all about them, so as to be\r\nable to teach them thoroughly and intelligently to an assistant. It is\r\nfrequently made an excuse for the soiled and slovenly and even torn\r\ncondition of books and bindings in a much used public library, that\r\nneither the librarian nor his aids have any time to look into the\r\ncondition of the books, much less to repair any of the numerous damages\r\nthey sustain. But it should be remembered that in most libraries, even\r\nthe busiest, there are seasons of the day, or periods of very stormy\r\nweather, when the frequentation of readers is quite small. Those times\r\nshould always be seized upon to take hold of volumes which have had to be\r\nlaid aside as damaged, in the hurry of business. To arrest such damages\r\nat the threshold is the duty and the interest of the library. A torn leaf\r\ncan be quickly mended, a slightly broken binding can be pasted or glued,\r\nturned-down leaves can be restored where they belong, a plate or map that\r\nis started can be fastened in, by devoting a few minutes at the proper\r\ntime, and with the proper appliances ready at hand. Multitudes of volumes\r\ncan be so treated in the course of the year, thus saving the heavy cost\r\nof rebinding. It is the proverbial stitch in time that saves nine. Never\r\nwait, in such matters, for the leisure day that never comes, but seize\r\nthe golden moment as it flies, when no reader is interrupting you, and\r\nclear off at least one of the little jobs that are awaiting your\r\nattention. No one who does not know how to use the odd moments is\r\nqualified for the duties of a librarian. I have seen, in country\r\nlibraries, the librarian and his lady assistant absorbed in reading\r\nnewspapers, with no other readers in the room. This is a use of valuable\r\ntime never to be indulged in during library hours. If they had given\r\nthose moments to proper care of the books under their charge, their\r\nshelves would not have been found filled with neglected volumes, many of\r\nwhich had been plainly badly treated and injured, but not beyond\r\nreclamation by timely and provident care.\r\n\r\nIt is amazing how any one can expect long employment as a librarian, who\r\ntakes no interest in the condition of the books under his charge. The way\r\nto build up a library, and to establish the reputation of a librarian at\r\nthe same time, is to devote every energy and intelligence to the great\r\nwork in hand. Convince the library directors, by incessant care of the\r\ncondition of the books, that you are not only a fit, but an indispensable\r\ncustodian of them. Let them see your methods of preserving and restoring,\r\nand they will be induced to give you every facility of which you stand in\r\nneed. Show them how the cost of binding or re-buying many books can be\r\nsaved by timely repair within the library, and then ask for another\r\nassistant to be always employed on such work at very moderate cost.\r\nLibrary directors and trustees are commonly intensely practical men, and\r\nquick to see into the heart of good management. They do not want a\r\nlibrarian who has a great reputation as a linguist, or an educator, or a\r\nbook-worm, but one who knows and cares about making their funds go as far\r\nas possible, and can show them how he has saved by restoring old books,\r\nenough money to pay for a great many new ones.\r\n\r\nNothing is more common in public lending libraries than to find torn\r\nleaves in some of the books. If the leaf is simply broken, without being\r\nabsolutely detached, or if part is torn off, and remains on hand, the\r\nvolume may be restored by a very simple process. Keep always at hand in\r\nsome drawer, a few sheets of thin \"onion-skin\" paper, or the transparent\r\nadhesive paper supplied by the Library Bureau. Paste this on either side\r\nof the torn leaf, seeing that it laps over all the points of juncture\r\nwhere the tear occurred, and that the fitting of the text or reading\r\nmatter is complete and perfect. The paper being transparent, there will\r\nbe no difficulty in reading the torn page through it.\r\n\r\nThis little piece of restoration should always be effected immediately on\r\ndiscovery, both that the torn piece or fragment may be saved, and that\r\nthe volume may be restored to use.\r\n\r\nIn case of absolute loss of a leaf or a part of a page, there are only\r\nthree remedies known to me.\r\n\r\n1. The book may be condemned as imperfect, and a new copy purchased.\r\n\r\n2. The missing part may be restored from a perfect copy of the same work,\r\nby copying the portions of the text wanting, and inserting them where\r\nthey belong. This can be done with a pen, and the written deficiency\r\nneatly inserted, in fac-simile of the type, or in ordinary script hand;\r\nor else the part wanting may be photographed or heliotyped by the best\r\nmodern process from a duplicate copy of the book.\r\n\r\n3. If the book is of very recent issue, the publishers may furnish a\r\nsignature or sheet which would make good the deficiency, from the\r\n\"imperfections\" left in the bindery, after making up the edition of the\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nIn most cases, the last named means of replacement will not be found\r\navailable. The first, or buying a fresh copy, may entail a greater\r\nexpense than the library authorities would deem proper at the time, and\r\nit might be preferred to continue the book in use, with a slight\r\nimperfection.\r\n\r\nThe second method, more or less troublesome according to circumstances,\r\nor the extent of the matter to be copied is sometimes the most\r\neconomical. Of course, it is subject to the drawback of not being, when\r\ndone, a _bona fide_ or genuine copy of the book as published. This\r\ndiminishes the commercial value of even the rarest book, although so\r\nfully restored as to text that the reader has it all before him, so that\r\nit supplies every requisite of a perfect copy for the purposes of a\r\npublic library, or a private owner who is not a connoisseur in books.\r\n\r\nWhen the corners of a book are found to be broken (as often happens by\r\nfalling to the floor or severe handling) the book may be restored by a\r\ntreatment which will give it new leather corners. With paste or glue well\r\nrubbed in, apply thick brown paper on the corners, which, when dry, will\r\nbe as hard as desired, and ready to receive the leather. Then the sides\r\nmay be covered with marbled paper or cloth, and the volume is restored.\r\n\r\nWhen the back of a book becomes loose, the remedy is to take it out of\r\nthe cover, re-sew it, and glue it firmly into the former back. This will\r\nof course render the back of the volume more rigid, but, in compensation,\r\nit will be more durable.\r\n\r\nIn these cases of loose or broken backs, the study should be to save the\r\nleather cover and the boards or sides of the book intact, so as to\r\ndiminish by more than one-half the cost of repair. As the volume cannot\r\nbe restored to a solid and safe condition without being re-sewed, it may\r\nbe carefully separated from the cover by cutting the cords or bands at\r\ntheir junction with the boards, then slowly stripping the book out of its\r\ncover, little by little, and treating the sheets when separated as\r\nalready indicated in the chapter on rebinding.\r\n\r\nOne of the most common defacements which library books undergo is marking\r\nup the margins with comments or references in pencil. Of course no\r\nthoughtful reader would be guilty of this practice, but thoughtless\r\nreaders are often in the majority, and the books they read or fancy that\r\nthey read, get such silly commentaries on the margins as these:\r\n\"beautiful,\" \"very sad,\" \"perfectly splendid,\" \"I think Becky is horrid,\"\r\nor, \"this book ends badly.\" Such vile practices or defacements are not\r\nalways traceable to the true offender, especially in a circulating\r\nlibrary, where the hours are so busy as to prevent the librarian from\r\nlooking through the volumes as they come in from the readers. But if\r\ndetected, as they may be after a few trials of suspected parties, by\r\ngiving them out books known to be clean and free from pencil marks when\r\nissued to them, the reader should be required always to rub out his own\r\nmarks, as a wholesome object-lesson for the future. The same course\r\nshould be pursued with any reader detected in scribbling on the margin of\r\nany book which is being read within the library. Incorrigible cases,\r\namounting to malicious marking up of books, should be visited by severe\r\npenalties--even to the denial of further library privileges to the\r\noffender.\r\n\r\nNot long ago, I bought at an auction sale a copy of the first edition of\r\nTennyson's \"In Memoriam,\" which was found on receipt to be defaced by\r\nmarking dozens of verses in the margin with black lines drawn along them,\r\nabsolutely with pen and ink! The owner of that book, who did the\r\nruthless deed, never reflected that it might fall into hands where his\r\nindelible folly would be sharply denounced.\r\n\r\nThe librarian or assistant librarian who will instinctively rub out all\r\npencil marks observed in a library book deserves well of his countrymen.\r\nIt is time well spent.\r\n\r\nThe writing on book-margins is so common a practice, and so destructive\r\nof the comfort and satisfaction which readers of taste should find in\r\ntheir perusal of books, that no legitimate means of arresting it or\r\nrepairing it should be neglected. In a public library in Massachusetts, a\r\nyoung woman of eighteen who was detected as having marked a library copy\r\nof \"Middlemarch\" with gushing effusions, was required to read the statute\r\nprescribing fine and imprisonment for such offenses, with very tearful\r\neffect, and undoubtedly with a wholesome and permanent improvement in her\r\nrelations to books and libraries.\r\n\r\nIn some libraries, a warning notice is posted up like this: \"Readers\r\nfinding a book injured or defaced, are required to report it at once to\r\nthe librarian, otherwise they will be held responsible for the damage\r\ndone.\" This rule, while its object is highly commendable, may lead in\r\npractice to injustice to some readers. So long as the reader uses the\r\nbook inside of the library walls, he should of course report such defects\r\nas meet his eye in reading, whether missing pages, plates, or maps, or\r\nserious internal soiling, torn leaves, etc. But in the case of drawing\r\nout books for home reading, the rule might embarrass any reader, however\r\nwell disposed, if too strictly construed. A reader finding any serious\r\ndefect in a library volume used at home, should simply place a mark or\r\nslip in the proper place with the word \"damaged,\" or \"defective\" written\r\non it. Then, on returning the book to the library, his simple statement\r\nof finding it damaged or defective when he came to read it should be\r\naccepted by the librarian as exonerating him from blame for any damage.\r\nAnd this gives point to the importance of examining every book, at least\r\nby cursory inspection, before it is handed out for use. A volume can be\r\nrun through quickly by a practiced hand, so as to show in a moment or two\r\nany leaves started or torn, or, usually, any other important injury. If\r\nany such is found, the volume should under no circumstances be given out,\r\nbut at once subjected to repair or restoration. This degree of care will\r\nnot only save the books of the library from rapid deterioration, but will\r\nalso save the feelings of readers, who might be anxious lest they be\r\nunjustly charged with damaging while in their hands.\r\n\r\nThe treatment of their imperfect books (which tend perpetually to\r\naccumulate) is very different in different libraries. Some libraries,\r\nwhere funds are ample enough to enable them to do it, condemn any book\r\nthat has so much as a sentence torn out, and replace it on the shelves\r\nwith a new copy. The imperfect volumes are sold for waste paper, or put\r\ninto some sale of duplicate books, marked as imperfect, with note of the\r\ndamage upon a slip inserted at the proper place in the book, and also in\r\nthe catalogue, if sold at auction or in a printed list of duplicates\r\noffered by the library. This notice of what imperfection exists is\r\nnecessary, so that no incautious purchaser may think that he is securing\r\na perfect copy of the work.\r\n\r\nOther libraries not blessed with means to pursue this course, do as best\r\nthey can afford, supplying what is deficient when possible without much\r\ncost of time or money, or else continuing the damaged book in use \"with\r\nall its imperfections on its head.\"\r\n\r\nThe loss of a single plate does not destroy the value of the book for\r\nreaders, however to be regretted as diminishing the satisfaction to be\r\nderived from the volume. And one can sometimes pardon the loss of a part\r\nof a page in a mutilated book, especially when he is made aware of the\r\nfact that the library which welcomes him to the free enjoyment of its\r\ntreasures cannot well afford to buy another.\r\n\r\nIt is disheartening to read, in an annual report of a public library of\r\ncirculation in Massachusetts, that many of its popular books are so\r\nsoiled and defaced, after a few readings, as to be unfit for further\r\nservice; that books of poetry are despoiled by the scissors to save\r\ntrouble of copying verses wanted; that plates are often abstracted, and\r\nthat many magazines \"seem to be taken from the library for no other\r\nreason than that private scrap-books may be enriched or restless children\r\namused.\" The only remedy suggested is to examine each book before again\r\ngiving it out, and, if returned defaced, to hold the borrower\r\nresponsible.\r\n\r\nThe art of cleaning books that are stained or dirty, is a matter not\r\nwidely known, and in this country there are few experts at it. Some of\r\nthese keep closely guarded the methods they use to cleanse a book.\r\nComparatively few libraries avail themselves of the practice of washing\r\ntheir soiled volumes, as the process is too expensive for most of them,\r\nand so they are accustomed to let the library books remain in use and\r\nre-issue them again and again, until they become so filthy as to be quite\r\nunfit to be seen--much less handled by any reader.\r\n\r\nBut there are often valuable or rare works which have sustained interior\r\ninjury, and which it is desired to restore to a clean condition. The best\r\nmethod is to take the book apart as the first step. When separated into\r\nsheets, those leaves which are merely dirty should be placed in a bath\r\ncomposed of about four ounces of chloride of lime, dissolved in a quart\r\nof water. They should soak until all stains are removed, and the paper is\r\nrestored to its proper color. Then the pages should be washed in cold\r\nwater--running water is preferable--and allowed to soak about six hours.\r\nThis removes all traces of the lime, which would otherwise tend to rot or\r\ninjure the book. After this, the sheets are to be \"sized,\" _i. e._,\r\ndipped in a bath of size and water, and laid out to dry. This process\r\ngives firmness and consistency to the paper, which would otherwise remain\r\ntoo soft to handle. The sheets should be pressed a few hours between\r\nglazed paste-boards, as used in printing offices. A cheap and simple size\r\nfor this purpose may be made by mixing white gelatine with water, and\r\nthis may be kept in a bottle, so as to be always conveniently at hand.\r\nThe art of restoring and rendering fit for handling books and rare early\r\npamphlets by sizing all the leaves is in constant use in Europe. By this\r\nmeans, and by piecing out margins, the most rotten paper, ready to drop\r\napart in turning the leaves, may be restored to use, if not quite to its\r\npristine condition.\r\n\r\nInk-spots or mildew stains may be wholly removed, when freshly made, by\r\napplying a solution of oxalic or citric acid, and then washing the leaf\r\nwith a wet sponge. It is more effectual to follow the bath of oxalic acid\r\nby applying a solution of one part hydrochloric acid to six parts of\r\nwater, after which bathe in cold water, and dry slowly. Or an infusion of\r\nhypochlorite of potash in twice its volume of water may be used instead\r\nof the preceding.\r\n\r\nIf a leather-bound book has grease on its cover, it can be removed by\r\nscraping French chalk or magnesia over the place, and ironing with a warm\r\n(not hot) iron. A simpler method is to apply benzine to the grease spots,\r\n(which dissolves the fatty material) and then dry the spot quickly with a\r\nfine cloth. This operation may be repeated, if not effectual at the first\r\ntrial. The same method of applying benzine to oily spots upon plates or\r\nengravings, will remove the stains.\r\n\r\nInk-stains may also be taken off from the leather covers of books bound\r\nin calf or morocco by the use of oxalic acid. Care should be taken first\r\nto try the acid on a piece of similar leather or on a discarded book of\r\nthe same color. If the leather is discolored after removing the black\r\nspot, one may apply, after taking out the traces of oxalic acid by some\r\nalkali, a coloring matter similar to the tint of the leather.\r\n\r\nSpots or stains of grease or oil are often found in books. They may be\r\nwholly removed by applying carbonate of magnesia on both sides of the\r\nleaf stained, backed by paper, and pressing with a hot iron, after which\r\nthe sheets should be washed and left under pressure over night. Another\r\nmethod is to dilute spirits of salts with five times its bulk of water,\r\nthen let the stained leaves lie in the liquid four minutes, after which\r\nthey are to be washed. Still another method is to make a mixture of one\r\npound of soap, half a pound of clay and two ounces of lime, dissolved in\r\nwater to a proper consistency; apply it to the spots; fifteen minutes\r\nafter, dip the leaf in a bath of warm water for half an hour, after which\r\ndry and press until smooth.\r\n\r\nStains left by mud on the leaves of a book (a not uncommon fate of\r\nvolumes falling in a wet street) can be removed thus: spread over the\r\nspots a jelly composed of white soap and water, letting it remain about\r\nhalf an hour. Then dip the leaf in clear water, and remove the soap with\r\na fine sponge dipped in warm water; all the mud stains will disappear at\r\nthe same time. To remove the last traces of the soap, dip a second time\r\nin clear water, place the leaf between two sheets of blotting paper, and\r\ndry slowly in a cool and shady place.\r\n\r\nThe same process, of washing in soap and water, will remove what are\r\ndoubtless the most common of all the soilings that library books\r\nundergo, namely, the soil that comes from the dirty hands and fingers of\r\nreaders.\r\n\r\nIt is sometimes necessary to color the sheets that have been washed\r\nwhite, so as to correspond in tint with the rest of the volume, which has\r\nnot needed that treatment. An infusion of cheap tobacco leaves, or a bath\r\nof brown stout will effect this.\r\n\r\nIn all these methods of removing soil from the pages of books, it is\r\nabsolutely necessary to give attention to thorough washing after the\r\nchemicals are used. Otherwise there will remain an element of destruction\r\nwhich will sooner or later spoil the book, to restore which so much pains\r\nmay have been expended.\r\n\r\nAnd one can readily learn how to restore a valuable book by these\r\nmethods. He should, however, first practice on the restoration of a\r\nvolume of little worth--and venture upon the treatment of a precious\r\nvolume only after practice has made him an expert.\r\n\r\nTo restore a fresher look to volumes whose bindings are much rubbed or\r\n\"scuffed\" as it is sometimes called, one may spread over their surface a\r\nlittle wet starch pretty thick, with a little alum added, applied with an\r\nold leather glove. With this the back of the book, and the sides and\r\nedges of the boards should be smartly rubbed, after which, with a fine\r\nrag rub off the thicker part of the starch, and the book will present a\r\nmuch brighter appearance, besides being rid of dust and soil.\r\n\r\nThere will remain on the volume a very slight deposit of gelatine or\r\ngluten; before it dries completely, the palm of the hand may be passed\r\nover it at all points, and the leather, which may have assumed a dull\r\ncolor from the starch, will resume a bright brown or other tint. If this\r\nfails to appear, a bit of flannel, impregnated with a few drops of\r\nvarnish, should be rubbed over the leather, and when nearly dry, rub\r\nwith a white rag slightly touched with olive oil, and a brilliant\r\nappearance will be given to the binding.\r\n\r\nWhen leaves are started, or a signature becomes loose in any volume, it\r\nshould be at once withdrawn from circulation, or the loss of an important\r\npart of the book may result. The remedy commonly resorted to, of patching\r\nup the book by pasting in the loose leaves, is a mere makeshift which\r\nwill not last. The cause of a loose signature is generally to be found in\r\na broken thread in the sewing, and the only permanent cure is to take the\r\nbook out of its cover, and re-sew it, when it may usually be re-inserted\r\nin the same binding. This is for cloth-bound books. When bound in\r\nleather, it is best to take out the loose sheet, \"overcast\" it, that is,\r\nsecure all the leaves by sewing, then carefully lay some paste along the\r\nouter edge or back of the sheet, insert the sheet in its place, pressing\r\nit firmly with a paper knife along the middle of the sheet, and the\r\nvolume will be restored ready for use after a few days drying under\r\nweight.\r\n\r\nOn occasion of a fire next to the Mercantile Library rooms in\r\nPhiladelphia, in 1877, great damage was done, from water thrown by the\r\nfire-engines, to many thousands of books. The library authorities tried\r\nvarious methods of restoring the volumes, and among others, drying them\r\nin ovens was resorted to. This was found, however, to dry the books so\r\nrapidly, that the bindings cracked, and in many cases came off, while\r\nmany volumes were much warped. The most advantageous method that was\r\nadopted was to prepare a large number of frames on which many wires were\r\nstrung horizontally across a large room. The wet books (many of which\r\nwere soaked through) were suspended on these wires in such a way as to\r\ndry them by degrees, the temperature of the room being raised\r\nconsiderably by furnace heat.\r\n\r\nThe condition in which the books were found after the wetting varied\r\ngreatly. Nearly all that were printed on soft paper were wet through,\r\nwhile those next to them printed on thick paper, and with solid leather\r\nbindings, were scarcely damaged at all. The water stains constituted the\r\nmost serious injury to the volumes, and multitudes of fine books that\r\nwere wet will always bear the marks of the stain. Some of the more costly\r\nbooks were restored by taking them apart, washing them thoroughly, then\r\nplacing them in a heated press, and drying them, so that the water-stains\r\nwere removed. All the books, however different the degree of damage from\r\nthe water, retained their legibility, and were put to the same uses in\r\nthe library as before the fire occurred. None were burned, the actual\r\nfire being confined to the neighboring buildings of the block in the\r\nmidst of which the library was unfortunately located.\r\n\r\nThe whole number of volumes damaged was about 55,000, and the insurance,\r\nwhich was assessed by referees at the amount of $42,000, would nearly\r\nhave replaced the books by new ones. Many of the volumes had to be\r\nrebound as the damage by wetting the glue and paste which are such\r\nimportant elements in binding securely, led to the falling apart of the\r\ncovers.\r\n\r\nThere are multitudes of books restored by some one of the processes which\r\nhave been ingeniously contrived to make an old book as good as new, or an\r\nimperfect volume perfect. The art of reproducing in facsimile, by mere\r\nmanual dexterity with the pen, letters, words, and whole pages, has been\r\ncarried to a high degree of perfection, notably in London. A celebrated\r\nbook restorer named Harris, gained a great reputation among book lovers\r\nand librarians by his consummate skill in the reproduction of the text\r\nof black-letter rarities and early-printed books of every kind. To such\r\nperfection did he carry the art of imitating an original that in many\r\ncases one could not distinguish the original from the imitation, and even\r\nexperts have announced a Harris facsimile in a Shakespeare folio to be\r\nthe printed original. The art has even been extended to engravings, with\r\nsuch success that the famous Droeshout portrait of Shakespeare, which\r\nillustrates the title-page of the first folio of 1623, has been\r\nmultiplied in pen-made facsimile, so as to deceive the most careful\r\nscrutiny.\r\n\r\nThis nice and difficult art is not widely pursued in this country, though\r\nthere are some experts among New York and Philadelphia book-binders, who\r\npractice it. The British Museum Library has a corps of workers engaged in\r\nthe restoration both of books and of manuscripts (as well as engravings)\r\nwho are men of the highest training and skill.\r\n\r\nThe process is necessarily quite expensive, because of the time required\r\nand of the small number of competing artists in this field. It is chiefly\r\nconfined to the restoration of imperfect copies of early printed and rare\r\nbooks, which are so frequently found in imperfect condition, often\r\nwanting title-pages or the final leaves, or parts of pages in any part of\r\nthe volume.\r\n\r\nSo costly, indeed, is this skilful hand-restoration of imperfect books,\r\nthat it has been a great boon to the collectors of libraries and rare\r\nworks, to see the arts of photography so developed in recent years, as to\r\nreproduce with almost exact fidelity printed matter of any kind from the\r\npages of books. The cost of such facsimiles of course varies with the\r\nlocality, the work, the skill, or the competition involved. But it may be\r\nsaid in general that the average cost of book-page facsimiles by\r\nphotographic process need not exceed one dollar a page.\r\n\r\nAn entire edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica has been printed from\r\nplates made in replica from photographs of the original text of the\r\nEdinburgh edition. The reproduction in this case can hardly be commended,\r\nas it is trying to the eyes to read, when compared with the original,\r\npresenting a somewhat blurred and irregular aspect to the eyes.\r\n\r\nIt is very difficult to lay down rules which shall be effective in\r\nchecking the abuse of books which compels exercise of the means of\r\nrestoration. Writing upon margins (already referred to) may sometimes be\r\nchecked by putting a printed slip in every library book bearing the\r\nwarning--\"Never write in a library book.\" To this may be added--\"Never\r\nturn down leaves,\" an equally important injunction. Indeed, a whole list\r\nof \"Dont's\" might be inserted, but for the chance that too many warnings\r\nmight operate to warn off a reader from absorbing any of them. Thus--\r\n\r\n    \"Don't soil any book\r\n    Don't write on margins\r\n    Don't turn down leaves\r\n    Don't lay a book on its face open\r\n    Don't wet fingers to turn leaves\r\n    Don't fail to use the book-mark\r\n    Don't read with unclean hands.\"\r\n\r\nAs a loose slip is liable to fall out, some such reminder should be\r\npasted into the fly-leaf of every book, next the book-plate.\r\n\r\nA self-respecting reader will generally heed such hints, which a moment's\r\nreflection will teach him are meant to preserve the library book clean\r\nand presentable for his own use, as well as for that of others. But there\r\nwill always be some rude, boorish people who will persist in their brutal\r\nand destructive treatment of books, in the face of whatever warnings. How\r\nto deal with such unwelcome persons is an ever-present problem with the\r\nlibrarian. If sustained by the other library authorities, a really\r\neffectual remedy is to deny the further use of the library to any\r\noffender clearly proven to have subjected library books to damage while\r\nin his hands. Some librarians go so far as to post the names of such\r\noffenders in the library hall, stating that they are denied the\r\nprivileges of the library by the authorities, for mutilating books.\r\n\r\nIn any case, great care must be taken to have the clearest proof, before\r\nproceeding to fasten the offense upon a particular individual. This\r\ninvolves, where the injury is not committed in the presence of any\r\nlibrary officer, so as to be observed, but has been done while the book\r\nwas drawn out, an examination of each volume before giving it out. If\r\nthis rule were to be observed as to all, it would entail an expense that\r\nfew libraries could afford. In a large circulating library in a city, it\r\nmight require the entire time of two assistants to collate the books\r\nbefore re-issuing them. The circumstances of each library must determine\r\nhow to deal with this matter. Probably the majority will limit the close\r\nexamination of books before giving them out, to cases where there is\r\nreason to suspect wilful continued soiling, scribbling, or dog's-earing.\r\nA few such cases once detected and dealt with will have a most salutary\r\nrestraining influence upon others, especially if re-enforced by frequent\r\nand judicious paragraphs in the local press, setting forth the offense\r\nand the remedy.\r\n\r\nBut all in vain will be the endeavor to abate these defacements and\r\nconsequent waste of the library books, unless it is enforced by a\r\npositive law, with penal provisions, to punish offenders who mutilate or\r\ndeface books that are public property. A good model of such a statute is\r\nthe following, slightly abridged as to verbiage, from an act of Congress,\r\nof which we procured the enactment in the year 1878:\r\n\r\n\"Any person who steals, defaces, injures, mutilates, tears, or destroys\r\nany book, pamphlet, work of art, or manuscript, belonging to any public\r\nlibrary, or to the United States, in the District of Columbia, shall be\r\nfined ten dollars to one hundred dollars, and punished by imprisonment\r\nfrom one to twelve months, for every such offense.\"\r\n\r\nThis act will be found in the United States Statutes at Large, Vol. 20,\r\np. 171. It would be well if the term \"periodical\" were added to the list\r\nof objects to be protected, to avoid all risk of a failure to punish the\r\nmutilation of newspapers and magazines, by pleading technical points, of\r\nwhich lawyers are prone to avail themselves in aiding offenders to escape\r\nconviction.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed, that the word \"deface,\" employed in this statute,\r\nactually covers the marking of margins by any reader, all such marking\r\nconstituting a defacement within the meaning of the law.\r\n\r\nWhile the great multitude of readers who frequent our public libraries\r\nare honest and trustworthy, there are always some who are conspicuously\r\nthe reverse. It is rarely safe in a large public library to admit readers\r\nto the shelves, without the company or the surveillance of an attendant.\r\nAnd it is not alone the uncultivated reader who cannot be trusted; the\r\nexperience of librarians is almost uniform to the effect that literary\r\nmen, and special scholars, as well as the collectors of rare books, are\r\namong those who watch the opportunity to purloin what they wish to save\r\nthemselves the cost of buying. Sometimes, you may find your most valuable\r\nwork on coins mutilated by the abstraction of a plate, carried off by\r\nsome student of numismatics. Sometimes, you may discover a fine picture\r\nor portrait abstracted from a book by some lover of art or collector of\r\nportraits. Again, you may be horrified by finding a whole sermon torn out\r\nof a volume of theology by a theological student or even a clergyman.\r\nAll these things have happened, and are liable to happen again. No\r\nlibrary is safe that is not closely watched and guarded. In the Astor\r\nlibrary a literary man actually tore out sixty pages of the _Revue de\r\nParis_, and added to the theft the fraud of plagiarism, by translating\r\nfrom the stolen leaves an article which he sold to Appleton's Journal as\r\nan original production!\r\n\r\nIn this case, the culprit, though detected, could not be punished, the\r\nlaw of New York requiring the posting in the library of the statute\r\nprohibiting mutilation or other injury to the books, and this posting had\r\nnot been done. The law has since been amended, to make the penalties\r\nabsolute and unconditional.\r\n\r\nIn the Astor Library, over six hundred volumes were discovered to have\r\nbeen mutilated, including art works, Patent office reports, magazines,\r\nnewspapers, and even encyclopaedias. The books stolen from that library\r\nhad been many, until several exposures and punishment of thieves inspired\r\na wholesome dread of a similar fate.\r\n\r\nAt a meeting of the American Library Association, one member inquired\r\nwhether there was any effectual way to prevent the abstraction of books.\r\nHe was answered by another librarian (from Cincinnati) who replied that\r\nhe knew of only one effectual method, and that was to keep a man standing\r\nover each book with a club. Of course this was a humorous paradox, not to\r\nbe taken literally, but it points a moral.\r\n\r\nSeriously, however, the evil may be greatly curtailed, (though we may be\r\nhopeless of absolute prevention) by adopting the precautions already\r\nreferred to. In the Library of the British Museum, a great library of\r\nreference, from which no book is permitted to be taken under any\r\ncircumstances, the evil of mutilation was much reduced by prosecuting\r\nand posting the offenders publicly. After a few years, the obnoxious\r\npractice had so far ceased, that the placards, having an unpleasant\r\naspect, were taken down. But on renewal of such depredations and\r\ndefacements of books by readers, the placards were renewed, and some of\r\nthe mutilated books, suitably labelled, were posted in the great reading\r\nroom before the eyes of all. The authorities of the British Museum are\r\nconvinced of the salutary effects of such warnings, though books are\r\nsometimes stolen or mutilated under the liberal management which leaves\r\nseveral thousand volumes open for reference, without tickets.\r\n\r\nThe late Dr. Wm. F. Poole, the Chicago librarian, recorded his experience\r\nin dealing with some clergymen, who, said he, seem to have as regards\r\nbooks, an imperfect appreciation of the laws of _meum_ and _tuum_. He had\r\nfound ministers more remiss in returning books than any other class of\r\nmen. He would by no means reflect on a noble and sacred profession by\r\ncharging the derelictions of a few upon the many. But he had had\r\nunpleasant experiences with men of that profession, who had absolutely\r\npurloined books from the Public Library, removed the book-plates and\r\nlibrary stamp, and covered the volumes with paper carefully pasted down\r\ninside of the covers.\r\n\r\nA librarian in Massachusetts testified that it was common experience that\r\nclergymen and professional men gave the most trouble. Second-hand\r\nbook-dealers in Boston had found a judge of the court purloining rare\r\npamphlets, and ministers making away with pamphlet sermons under their\r\ncoats. Without insisting here upon any such extenuations of such\r\npractices as the prevalence of kleptomania, it has been made abundantly\r\nmanifest that theft and mutilation of books are sufficiently common to\r\ndemonstrate the weakness of human nature, and the necessity of every\r\nsafeguard which public libraries can provide against such abuses of\r\ntheir treasures.\r\n\r\nA Boston librarian stated that the thieves or mutilators of books\r\nincluded school-boys, clerks, students, teachers, soldiers, physicians,\r\nlawyers, clergymen, etc. In only one case was the crime committed through\r\nwant or suffering. Yet, though the offenders had been proven guilty in\r\nevery instance, only two cases were known in which the penalty of the law\r\nhad been enforced. Does not this bespeak laxity of public morals in\r\nBoston in regard to such abuses of library property?\r\n\r\nThe Union Theological Seminary at New York recorded its experience with\r\nministers and theological students, to the effect that its library had\r\nlost more than a thousand volumes, taken and not returned. This of course\r\nincluded what were charged out, but could not be recovered.\r\n\r\nA librarian in Auburn, N. Y., returning from vacation, found that the\r\nAmerican Architect, an important illustrated weekly, had been mutilated\r\nin seven different volumes, and that 130 pages in all had been stolen.\r\nFortunately, she was able to trace the reader who had been using the\r\nwork, and succeeded in recovering the abstracted plates. The offender was\r\nprosecuted to conviction, and had to pay a fine of fifty dollars.\r\n\r\nIt often happens that books which disappear mysteriously from a public\r\nlibrary re-appear quite as mysteriously. Those taking them, finding that\r\nthe rules do not allow certain books to leave the library, make a law\r\nunto themselves, carry off the book wanted, keep it until read, and then\r\nreturn it surreptitiously, by replacing it on some shelf or table, when\r\nno one is looking. This is where no intention of stealing the book\r\nexists, and the borrower wilfully makes his own convenience override the\r\nlibrary regulations, in the belief that he will not be found out. The\r\nBuffalo Young Men's Library reported in one year eighteen illustrated\r\nworks on the fine arts, reserved from being taken out by its by-laws, as\r\ndisappearing for weeks, but brought back in this underhanded manner. In\r\nother cases of such return, it is likely that the purpose was to keep the\r\nbook, but that conscience or better thoughts, or fear of detection\r\nprevailed, and secured its return.\r\n\r\nSome instances where leniency has been exercised to save book thieves\r\nfrom penalties may be instructive. One man who had carried off and sold\r\ntwo volumes from the Astor Library was traced and arrested, when he\r\npleaded that absolute want had driven him to the act. He had a wife ill\r\nand starving at his home, and this on investigation proving true, he was\r\npardoned and saved further misery.\r\n\r\nIn another case, a poor German had stolen a volume of the classics which\r\nhe pawned for a small sum to get bread for himself, being long out of\r\nwork, and in a condition bordering closely upon starvation. He was\r\nreleased, the book reclaimed, and the offender turned over to the\r\nagencies of public charity.\r\n\r\nA librarian of New York gave it as his experience that some ministers are\r\nnot to be trusted any more than other people. Some of them like to write\r\ntheir opinions on the margins of the books. He found one of the library\r\nbooks written on in thirty pages, recognized the hand-writing, and wrote\r\nto the reverend gentleman asking an interview. He came, admitted the\r\nfact, and said that his notes made the book more valuable. This ingenious\r\nexcuse did not satisfy the librarian, who said, \"others do not think so,\r\nsir; so if you will get us a new book, you may keep the more valuable\r\none.\" He soon brought in a new copy, and the matter ended.\r\n\r\nAt the New York Mercantile Library, a young lady, amply able to buy all\r\nthe books she could want, was discovered going out of the library with\r\none book in her hand which she was entitled to, it being charged, and\r\nwith five others hidden under her cloak, without permission.\r\n\r\nMr. Melvil Dewey has truly said that it is very hard to tell a library\r\nthief at sight. Well-dressed, gentlemanly, even sanctimonious looking men\r\nare among them, and the wife of a well-known college professor, detected\r\nin purloining books, begged so hard not to be exposed, that she was\r\nreluctantly pardoned, and even restored to library privileges.\r\n\r\nA prominent lawyer of Brooklyn, of distinguished appearance and fine\r\nmanners, did not steal books, but his specialty was magazines and\r\nnewspapers, which he carried off frequently. Being caught at it one day,\r\nand accused by the librarian, he put on an air of dignity, declared he\r\nwas insulted, and walked out. The librarian found the periodical he had\r\ntaken thrown down in the entry, and he never after frequented that\r\nlibrary.\r\n\r\nIt is curious and instructive to know the experience of some libraries\r\nregarding the theft or mutilation of books. Thus, in the public library\r\nof Woburn, Mass., a case of mutilation occurred by the cutting out of a\r\npicture from \"Drake's Historic Fields and Mansions of Middlesex County.\"\r\nOn discovery of the loss, a reward of $10 was offered for information\r\nleading to detection of the culprit. This was published in the town\r\npaper, and an article was printed calling attention to these library\r\nthefts and abuses, followed by citing the State law making such\r\ndepredations a penal offense. Within a week the missing plate came back\r\nto the librarian through the mail--anonymously of course, the person who\r\nhad abstracted it finding that it was rather an unsafe picture to keep or\r\nexhibit, and so choosing to make his best policy honesty, though rather\r\ntardy in coming to that wise conclusion.\r\n\r\nThis experience, and others here cited, may serve as a hint what course\r\nto pursue under similar circumstances, in the reclamation of library\r\nbooks.\r\n\r\nIn the Library of the London Institution, continuous thefts of valuable\r\neditions of the classics had occurred. Putting a detective in the\r\nlibrary, a young man of suspicious demeanor was soon identified as the\r\nthief, and was followed and arrested in the very act of selling a library\r\nbook. He proved to be a young man of good family, education and previous\r\ngood character; but the library had suffered such losses from his\r\ndepredations, that no mercy was shown, and he received and underwent the\r\nsentence to two months imprisonment.\r\n\r\nIt may be added as an instance of methods availed of in London to trace\r\nmissing books, that the librarian, knowing from the vacancies on the\r\nshelves what books had been abstracted, printed a list of them, sent it\r\nto every second-hand book-dealer in London, at the same time supplying it\r\nto the police, who circulate daily a list of missing property among all\r\nthe pawn-brokers' shops in the city, and recovered all the books within\r\ntwenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nThe Mercantile Library of Philadelphia missed a number of valuable books\r\nfrom its shelves, and on a watch being set, a physician in the most\r\nrespectable rank in society was detected as the purloiner, and more than\r\nfifty volumes recovered from him.\r\n\r\nA library at Lancaster, Pa., reported the almost incredible incident of a\r\nthief having hidden under his coat, and carried off, a Webster's\r\nUnabridged Dictionary!\r\n\r\nIn most cases of detected theft or mutilation of books, strong appeals\r\nare made by the culprit or his friends to save exposure by public\r\nprosecution. These are commonly, in the case of persons in very\r\nrespectable circumstances in life, not so much to avoid paying fines\r\nimposed by law as to avoid the disgrace attached to publicity, and the\r\nconsequent damage done to the character of the individual. It is probably\r\ntrue that in a majority of cases, such influences have been strong enough\r\nto overcome the determination of the librarian or library authorities to\r\nlet the law take its course. Now, while it must be admitted that there is\r\nno rule without some valid exception that may be made, it is nevertheless\r\nto be insisted upon that due protection to public property in libraries\r\ndemands the enforcement of the laws enacted to that end. The consequence\r\nof leniency to the majority of book thieves would be not only an indirect\r\nencouragement to the culprits to continue their depredations, but it\r\nwould also lead to a lax and dangerous notion of the obligations of\r\nreaders, and the sacredness of such property, in the public mind.\r\nEnforcement of the penalties of wrong-doing, on the other hand, tends\r\nunquestionably to deter others, both by the fear of publicity which must\r\nfollow detection, and by terror of the penalty which is or may be\r\nimprisonment for a considerable term, besides the imposing of a fine.\r\n\r\nAt the Worcester, Mass., Public Library, a young man of twenty-two was\r\ndetected in stealing a book, obliged to confess, and prosecuted. Much\r\npressure was brought to bear by his family and friends, very respectable\r\npeople, to save him from the penalty. The Court, however, imposed a fine\r\nof thirty dollars, and it being represented that his relatives would have\r\nto pay the amount, though innocent parties, the judge suspended the\r\nsentence until the young man should pay it in instalments from his own\r\nearnings, one of the family giving bail. The valuable lesson was in this\r\nway not lost, either to the offender or to the community; the law was\r\nenforced, and the young man perhaps saved from a life of wrong-doing,\r\nwhile if he had been let off scot-free, in deference to the influence\r\nexerted to that end, he might have gone from bad to worse.\r\n\r\nAt the Pratt Institute Free Library in Brooklyn, books had been\r\ndisappearing from the reference department at intervals of about a week,\r\nand a watch was instituted. After some weeks' fruitless watching, a young\r\nman who came frequently to consult books was singled out as the probable\r\noffender, and the eyes of the library staff were centered upon him. The\r\njanitor watched his movements for some days, from a concealed post of\r\nobservation, as the young man walked back and forth between the book\r\nstacks, and one day caught him in the act of slipping a book into his\r\npocket, and arrested him as he was leaving the building. He had stolen a\r\ndozen books from the library, all but three of which were recovered. He\r\nclaimed to be a theological student, and that he had taken the books\r\nmerely for the purposes of study. Much sympathy was expressed for him by\r\npeople who believed that this was his motive, and that it was some\r\npartial atonement for his offense. The grief of his relatives at his\r\ndisgrace was intense. The Court sentenced him to eight years in the\r\npenitentiary, but suspended the sentence in view of the fact that it was\r\na first offense, by a youth of twenty-one years. He was put under police\r\nsurveillance for his good behavior (equivalent to being paroled) but the\r\nsentence becomes active upon any further transgression of the law on his\r\npart.\r\n\r\nIt may be gathered from these many cases of library depredations, that\r\nthey are very common, that perpetual vigilance is the price of safety,\r\nthat punishment in nearly all cases is wiser than pardon, and that the\r\nfew exceptions made should be mostly confined to offenders who steal\r\nbooks under desperate necessity or actual want.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 7.\r\n\r\nPAMPHLET LITERATURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is a pamphlet? is a question which is by no means capable of being\r\nscientifically answered. Yet, to the librarian dealing continually with a\r\nmass of pamphlets, books, and periodicals, it becomes important to define\r\nsomewhere, the boundary line between the pamphlet and the book. The\r\ndictionaries will not aid us, for they all call the pamphlet \"a few\r\nsheets of printed paper stitched together, but not bound.\" Suppose (as\r\noften happens) that you bind your pamphlet, does it then cease to be a\r\npamphlet, and become a book? Again, most pamphlets now published are not\r\nstitched at all, but stabbed and wired to fasten the leaves together. The\r\norigin of the word \"pamphlet,\" is in great doubt. A plausible derivation\r\nis from two French words, \"_paume_,\" and \"_feuillet_,\" literally a\r\nhand-leaf; and another derives the word from a corruption of\r\nLatin--\"_papyrus_,\" paper, into _pampilus_, or _panfletus_, whence\r\npamphlet. The word is in Shakespeare:\r\n\r\n    \"Comest thou with deep premeditated lines,\r\n     With written pamphlets studiously devised?\"\r\n\r\nBut we also find \"pamphlets and bookys,\" in a work printed by Caxton in\r\n1490, a hundred years before Shakespeare.\r\n\r\nWhatever the origin, the common acceptation of the word is plain,\r\nsignifying a little book, though where the pamphlet ends, and the book\r\nbegins, is uncertain. The rule of the British Museum Library calls every\r\nprinted publication of one hundred pages or less, a pamphlet. This is\r\narbitrary, and so would any other rule be. As that library binds its\r\npamphlets separately, and counts them in its aggregate of volumes, the\r\nreason for any distinction in the matter is not plain. Some of the\r\ngovernment libraries in Europe are greatly overrated numerically by\r\nreckoning pamphlets as volumes. Thus, the Royal Library at Munich, in\r\nBavaria, has been ranked fourth among the libraries of the world,\r\nclaiming over a million volumes, but as it reckons every university\r\nthesis, or discussion of some special topic by candidates for degrees, as\r\na volume, and has perhaps 400,000 of this prolific class of publications,\r\nit is actually not so large as some American libraries, which count their\r\npamphlets as distinct from books in their returns.\r\n\r\nThe pamphlet, or thin book, or tract (as some prefer to call it) is\r\nreckoned by some librarians as a nuisance, and by others as a treasure.\r\nThat it forms rather a troublesome asset in the wealth of a library\r\ncannot be doubted. Pamphlets taken singly, will not stand upon the\r\nshelves; they will curl up, become dogs-eared, accumulate dust, and get\r\nin the way of the books. If kept in piles, as is most frequent, it is\r\nvery hard to get at any one that is wanted in the mass. Then it is\r\nobjected to them, that the majority of them are worthless, that they cost\r\naltogether too much money, and time, and pains, to catalogue them, and\r\nthat they are useless if not catalogued; that if kept bound, they cost\r\nthe library a sum out of all proportion to their value; that they\r\naccumulate so rapidly (much faster, in fact, than books) as to outrun the\r\nmeans at the disposal of any library to deal with them; in short, that\r\nthey cost more than they come to, if bound, and if unbound, they vex the\r\nsoul of the librarian day by day.\r\n\r\nThis is one side of the pamphlet question; and it may be candidly\r\nadmitted, that in most libraries, the accumulation of uncatalogued and\r\nunbound pamphlets is one of the chief among those arrears which form the\r\nskeleton in the closet of the librarian. But there is another side to the\r\nmatter. It is always possible to divide your pamphlets into two\r\nclasses--the important, and the insignificant. Some of them have great\r\nhistorical, or economic, or intellectual value; others are as nearly\r\nworthless as it is possible for any printed matter to be. Why should you\r\ntreat a pamphlet upon Pears's soap, or a quack medicine, or advertising\r\nthe Columbia bicycle, with the same attention which you would naturally\r\ngive to an essay on international politics by Gladstone, or a review of\r\nthe Cuban question by a prominent Spaniard, or a tract on Chinese\r\nimmigration by Minister Seward, or the pamphlet genealogy of an American\r\nfamily? Take out of the mass of pamphlets, as they come in, what appear\r\nto you the more valuable, or the more liable to be called for; catalogue\r\nand bind them, or file them away, according to the use which they are\r\nlikely to have: relegate the rest, assorted always by subject-matters or\r\nclasses, to marked piles, or to pamphlet cases, according to your means;\r\nand the problem is approximately solved.\r\n\r\nTo condemn any pamphlet to \"innocuous desuetude,\" or to permanent\r\nbanishment from among the intellectual stores of a library, merely\r\nbecause it is innocent of a stiff cover, is to despoil the temple of\r\nlearning and reject the good things of Providence. What great and\r\ninfluential publications have appeared in the world in the guise of\r\npamphlets! Milton's immortal \"Areopagitica, or Plea for Unlicenced\r\nPrinting,\" was a pamphlet of only forty pages; Webster's speech for the\r\nUnion, in reply to Hayne, was a pamphlet; every play of Shakespeare, that\r\nwas printed in his life-time, was a pamphlet; Charles Sumner's discourse\r\non \"The True Grandeur of Nations\" was a pamphlet; the \"Crisis\" and\r\n\"Common Sense\" of Thomas Paine, which fired the American heart in the\r\nRevolution, were pamphlets. Strike out of literature, ancient and modern,\r\nwhat was first published in pamphlets, and you would leave it the poorer\r\nand weaker to an incalculable degree.\r\n\r\nPamphlets are not only vehicles of thought and opinion, and propagandists\r\nof new ideas; they are often also store-houses of facts, repositories of\r\nhistory, annals of biography, records of genealogy, treasuries of\r\nstatistics, chronicles of invention and discovery. They sometimes throw\r\nan unexpected light upon obscure questions where all books are silent.\r\nBeing published for the most part upon some subject that was interesting\r\nthe public mind when written, they reflect, as in a mirror, the social,\r\npolitical, and religious spirit and life of the time. As much as\r\nnewspapers, they illustrate the civilization (or want of it) of an epoch,\r\nand multitudes of them, preserved in great libraries, exhibit this at\r\nthose early periods when no newspapers existed as vehicles of public\r\nopinion. Many of the government libraries of Europe have been buying up\r\nfor many years past, the rare, early-printed pamphlets of their\r\nrespective countries, paying enormous prices for what, a century ago,\r\nthey would have slighted, even as a gift.\r\n\r\nWhen Thomas Carlyle undertook to write the life of Oliver Cromwell, and\r\nto resurrect from the dust-bins of two centuries, the letters and\r\nspeeches of the great Protector, he found his richest quarry in a\r\ncollection of pamphlets in the British Museum Library. An indefatigable\r\npatriot and bookseller, named Thomason, had carefully gathered and kept\r\nevery pamphlet, book, periodical, or broadside that appeared from the\r\nBritish press, during the whole time from A. D. 1649 to 1660, the period\r\nof the interregnum in the English monarchy, represented by Cromwell and\r\nthe Commonwealth. This vast collection, numbering over 20,000 pamphlets,\r\nbound in 2,000 volumes, after escaping the perils of fire, and of both\r\nhostile armies, was finally purchased by the King, and afterward\r\npresented to the British Museum Library. Its completeness is one great\r\nsource of its value, furnishing, as it does, to the historical student of\r\nthat exceedingly interesting revolution, the most precious memorials of\r\nthe spirit of the times, many of which have been utterly lost, except the\r\nsingle copy preserved in this collection.\r\n\r\nSeveral great European libraries number as many pamphlets as books in\r\ntheir collections. The printed catalogue of the British Museum Library is\r\nwidely sought by historical students, because of the enormous amount of\r\npamphlet literature it contains, that is described nowhere else. And the\r\nLibrarian of the Boston Athenaeum said that some readers found the great\r\ninterest in his catalogue of that collection lay in its early American\r\npamphlets.\r\n\r\nAs another instance of the value to the historical stores of a public\r\nlibrary of this ephemeral literature, it may be noted that the great\r\ncollection of printed matter, mostly of a fugitive character, relating to\r\nthe French Revolutionary period, gathered by the late M. de La Bedoyère,\r\namounted to 15,000 volumes and pamphlets. Fifty years of the life of the\r\nwealthy and enthusiastic collector, besides a very large sum of money,\r\nwere spent in amassing this collection. With an avidity almost\r\nincredible, he ransacked every book-store, quay, and private shelf that\r\nmight contribute a fresh morsel to his stores; and when Paris was\r\nexhausted, had his agents and purveyors busy in executing his orders all\r\nover Europe. Rival collectors, and particularly M. Deschiens, who had\r\nbeen a contemporary in the Revolution, and had laid aside everything that\r\nappeared in his day, only contributed at their decease, to swell the\r\nprecious stores of M. de La Bedoyère. This vast collection, so precious\r\nfor the history of France at its most memorable period, contained\r\nseveral thousands of volumes of newspapers and ephemeral journals, and\r\nwas acquired in the year 1863, for the National Library of France, where\r\nit will ever remain a monument to the enlightened and far-sighted spirit\r\nof its projector.\r\n\r\nIn like manner, the late Peter Force, Mayor of Washington City, and\r\nhistoriographer of the \"American Archives,\" devoted forty years to\r\namassing an extensive collection of _Americana_, or books, pamphlets,\r\nnewspapers, manuscripts, and maps, relating to the discovery, history,\r\ntopography, natural history, and biography of America. He carried off at\r\nauction sales, from all competitors, six great collections of early\r\nAmerican pamphlets, formed by Ebenezer Hazard, William Duane, Oliver\r\nWolcott, etc., representing the copious literature of all schools of\r\npolitical opinion. He sedulously laid aside and preserved every pamphlet\r\nthat appeared at the capital or elsewhere, on which he could lay hands,\r\nand his rich historical collection, purchased by the government in 1866,\r\nthirty-three years ago, now forms an invaluable portion of the\r\nCongressional Library.\r\n\r\nOf the multitudinous literature of pamphlets it is not necessary to speak\r\nat length. Suffice it to say that the library which neglects the\r\nacquisition and proper preservation and binding of these publications is\r\nfar behind its duty, both to those of its own generation, and to those\r\nwhich are to follow. The pamphlet literature of every period often\r\nfurnishes the most precious material to illustrate the history and\r\ndevelopment of that period. The new ideas, the critical sagacity, the\r\npolitical controversies, the mechanical and industrial development, the\r\nreligious thought, and the social character of many epochs, find their\r\nbest expression in the pamphlets that swarmed from the press while those\r\nagencies were operating. The fact that multitudes of these productions\r\nare anonymous, does not detract from their value as materials for\r\nstudents.\r\n\r\nPamphlets, from their peculiar style of publication, and the difficulty\r\nof preserving them, tend to disappear more quickly than any class of\r\npublications except newspapers, and broad-sides, and hand-bills. They are\r\nfar less likely to be preserved in the hands of private holders than even\r\nreviews and magazines. It is the common experience of librarians that a\r\npamphlet is far more difficult to procure than a book. Multitudes of\r\npamphlets are annually lost to the world, from the want of any preserving\r\nhand to gather them and deposit them permanently in some library. So much\r\nthe more important is it that the custodians of all our public libraries\r\nshould form as complete collections as possible of all pamphlets, at\r\nleast, that appear in their own city or neighborhood. How to do this is a\r\nproblem not unattended with difficulty. Pamphlets are rarely furnished\r\nfor sale in the same manner as books, and when they are, book-sellers\r\ntreat them with such indignity that they are commonly thrust aside as\r\nwaste paper, almost as soon as they have appeared from the press. If all\r\nthe writers of pamphlets would take pains to present them to the public\r\nlibraries of the country, and especially to those in their own\r\nneighborhood, they would at once enrich these collections, and provide\r\nfor the perpetuity of their own thought. A vigilant librarian should\r\ninvite and collect from private libraries all the pamphlets which their\r\nowners will part with. It would also be a wise practice to engage the\r\nprinting-offices where these fugitive leaves of literature are put in\r\ntype, to lay aside one copy of each for the library making the\r\ncollection.\r\n\r\nOur local libraries should each and all make it a settled object to\r\npreserve not only full sets of the reports of all societies,\r\ncorporations, charity organizations, churches, railroads, etc., in their\r\nown neighborhood, but all catalogues of educational institutions, all\r\nsermons or memorial addresses, and in short, every fugitive publication\r\nwhich helps to a knowledge of the people or the region in which the\r\nlibrary is situated.\r\n\r\nThe binding of pamphlets is a mooted point in all libraries. While the\r\nBritish Museum and the Library of Congress treat the pamphlets as a book,\r\nbinding all separately, this is deemed in some quarters too vexatious and\r\ntroublesome, as well as needlessly expensive. It must be considered,\r\nhowever, that the crowding together of a heterogenous mass of a dozen or\r\ntwenty pamphlets, by different authors, and on various subjects, into a\r\nsingle cover, is just as objectionable as binding books on unrelated\r\nsubjects together. Much time is consumed in finding the pamphlet wanted,\r\namong the dozen or more that precede or follow it, and, if valuable or\r\nmuch sought-for pamphlets are thus bound, many readers may be kept\r\nwaiting for some of them, while one reader engrosses the volume\r\ncontaining all. Besides, if separately bound, a single pamphlet can be\r\nfar more easily replaced in case of loss than can a whole volume of them.\r\nPamphlets may be lightly bound in paste-board, stitched, with cloth\r\nbacks, at a small cost; and the compensating advantage of being able to\r\nclassify them like books upon the shelves, should weigh materially in the\r\ndecision of the question. If many are bound together, they should\r\ninvariably be assorted into classes, and those only on the same general\r\ntopic should be embraced in the same cover. The long series of annual\r\nreports of societies and institutions, corporations, annual catalogues,\r\netc., need not be bound separately, but should be bound in chronological\r\nseries, with five to ten years in a volume, according to thickness. So\r\nmay several pamphlets, by the same writer, if preferred, be bound\r\ntogether. Libraries which acquire many bound volumes of pamphlets should\r\ndivide them into series, and number them throughout with strict reference\r\nto the catalogue. There will thus be accumulated a constantly increasing\r\nseries of theological, political, agricultural, medical, educational,\r\nscientific, and other pamphlets, while the remaining mass, which cannot\r\nbe thus classified, may be designated in a consecutive series of volumes,\r\nas \"Miscellaneous Pamphlets.\" When catalogued, the title-page or\r\nbeginning of each pamphlet in the volume, should be marked by a thin slip\r\nof unsized paper, projected above the top of the book, to facilitate\r\nquick reference in finding each one without turning many leaves to get at\r\nthe titles. In all cases, the contents of each volume of pamphlets should\r\nbe briefed in numerical order upon the fly-leaf of the volume, and its\r\ncorresponding number, or sequence in the volumes written in pencil on the\r\ntitle page of each pamphlet, to correspond with the figures of this brief\r\nlist. Then the catalogue of each should indicate its exact location,\r\nthus: Wilkeson (Samuel) How our National Debt may become a National\r\nBlessing, 21 pp. 8vo. Phila., 1863 [Miscellaneous pamphlets, v. 347:3],\r\nmeaning that this is the third pamphlet bound in vol. 347.\r\n\r\nThe only objection to separate binding of each pamphlet, is the increased\r\nexpense. The advantage of distinct treatment may or may not outweigh\r\nthis, according to the importance of the pamphlet, the circumstances of\r\nthe library, and the funds at its command. If bound substantially in good\r\nhalf-leather, with leather corners, the cost is reckoned at 1_s._ 4_d._\r\neach, in London. Here, they cost about thirty cents with cloth sides,\r\nwhich may be reduced by the use of marble or Manila paper, to twenty\r\ncents each. Black roan is perhaps the best leather for pamphlets, as it\r\nbrings out the lettering on the backs more distinctly--always a cardinal\r\npoint in a library.\r\n\r\nBut there is a more economical method, which dispenses with leather\r\nentirely. As no patent is claimed for the invention, or rather the\r\nmodification of well-known methods, it may be briefly described. The\r\nthinnest tar-board is used for the sides, which, _i. e._, the boards, are\r\ncut down to nearly the size of the pamphlet to be bound. The latter is\r\nprepared for the boards by adding two or more waste leaves to the front\r\nand back, and backing it with a strip of common muslin, which is firmly\r\npasted the full length of the back, and overlaps the sides to the width\r\nof an inch or more. The pamphlet has to be stitched through, or stabbed\r\nand fastened with wire, in the manner commonly practiced with thin books;\r\nafter which it is ready to receive the boards. These are glued to a strip\r\nof book muslin, which constitutes the ultimate back of the book, being\r\nturned in neatly at each end, so as to form, with the boards, a skeleton\r\ncover, into which the pamphlet is inserted, and held in its place by the\r\ninner strip of muslin before described, which is pasted or glued to the\r\ninside of the boards. The boards are then covered with marbled paper,\r\nturned in at each edge, and the waste leaves pasted smoothly down to the\r\nboards on the inside. The only remaining process is the lettering, which\r\nis done by printing the titles in bronze upon glazed colored paper, which\r\nis pasted lengthwise on the back. A small font of type, with a\r\nhand-press, will suffice for this, and a stabbing machine, with a small\r\npair of binding shears, constitutes the only other apparatus required.\r\nThe cost of binding pamphlets in this style varies from seven to twelve\r\ncents each, according to the material employed, and the amount of labor\r\npaid for. The advantages of the method are too obvious to all acquainted\r\nwith books to require exemplification.\r\n\r\nTwo still cheaper methods of binding may be named. What is known as the\r\nHarvard binder, employed in that library at Cambridge, Mass., consists\r\nsimply of thin board sides with muslin back, and stubs also of cloth on\r\nthe inside. The pamphlet is inserted and held in place by paste or glue.\r\nThe cost of each binding is stated at six cents.\r\n\r\nThe cheapest style of separate treatment for pamphlets yet suggested is\r\nof stiff Manila paper, with cloth back, costing about three cents each.\r\n\r\nI think that the rule of never mixing incongruous subjects within the\r\nsame cover should be adhered to. The expense, by the cheaper method of\r\nbinding referred to, is but slightly greater than must be incurred by\r\nbinding several in a volume, in solid half morocco style. But, whenever\r\npamphlets are bound together, the original printed paper covers should\r\nnever be destroyed, but should be bound in.\r\n\r\nAnother method of preserving pamphlets is to file them away in selected\r\nlots, placed inside of cloth covers, of considerable thickness. These may\r\nbe had from any book-binder, being the rejected covers in which books\r\nsent for re-binding were originally bound. If kept in this way, each\r\nvolume, or case of pamphlets, should be firmly tied with cord (or better\r\nwith tape) fastened to the front edge of the cloth cover. Never use\r\nrubber or elastic bands for this, or any other purpose where time and\r\nsecurity of fastening are involved, because the rubber will surely rot in\r\na few weeks or months, and be useless as a means of holding together any\r\nobjects whatever.\r\n\r\nStill another means of assorting and keeping pamphlets is to use\r\nWoodruff's file-holders, one of which holds from ten to thirty pamphlets\r\naccording to their thickness. They should be arranged in classes, placing\r\nin each file case only pamphlets on similar subjects, in order of the\r\nauthors' names, arranged alphabetically. Each pamphlet should be plainly\r\nnumbered at its head by colored pencil, with the figure of its place in\r\nthe volume, and the number of the case, containing it, which should also\r\nbe volumed, and assigned to shelves containing books on related subjects.\r\nI need not add that all these numbers should correspond with the\r\ncatalogue-title of each pamphlet. Then, when any one pamphlet is wanted,\r\nsend for the case containing it, find it and withdraw it at once by its\r\nnumber, place it in one of the Koch spring-back binders, and give it to\r\nthe reader precisely like any book that is served at the library counter.\r\n\r\nA more economical plan still, for libraries which cannot afford the\r\nexpense of the Woodruff file-holders, is to cut out cases for the\r\npamphlets, of suitable size, from tough Manila board, which need not cost\r\nmore than about three cents each case.\r\n\r\nIn whatever way the unbound pamphlets are treated, you should always mark\r\nthem as such on the left-hand margin of each catalogue-card, by the\r\ndesignation \"ub.\" (unbound) in pencil. If you decide later, to bind any\r\nof them, this pencil-mark should be erased from the cards, on the return\r\nof the pamphlets from the bindery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 8.\r\n\r\nPERIODICAL LITERATURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe librarian who desires to make the management of his library in the\r\nhighest degree successful, must give special attention to the important\r\nfield of periodical literature. More and more, as the years roll on, the\r\nperiodical becomes the successful rival of the book in the claim for\r\npublic attention. Indeed, we hear now and then, denunciations of the\r\never-swelling flood of magazines and newspapers, as tending to drive out\r\nthe book. Readers, we are told, are seduced from solid and improving\r\nreading, by the mass of daily, weekly, and monthly periodicals which lie\r\nin wait for them on every hand. But no indiscriminate censure of\r\nperiodicals or of their reading, can blind us to the fact of their great\r\nvalue. Because some persons devote an inordinate amount of time to them,\r\nis no reason why we should fail to use them judiciously ourselves, or to\r\naid others in doing so. And because many periodicals (and even the vast\r\nmajority) are of little importance, and are filled with trifling and\r\nephemeral matter, that fact does not discredit the meritorious ones.\r\nCounterfeit currency does not diminish the value of the true coin; it is\r\nvery sure to find its own just level at last; and so the wretched or the\r\nsensational periodical, however pretentious, will fall into inevitable\r\nneglect and failure in the long run.\r\n\r\nIt is true that the figures as to the relative issues of books and\r\nperiodicals in the publishing world are startling enough to give us\r\npause. It has been computed that of the annual product of the American\r\npress, eighty-two per cent. consists of newspapers, ten per cent. of\r\nmagazines and reviews, and only eight per cent. of books. Yet this vast\r\nredundancy of periodical literature is by no means such a menace to our\r\npermanent literature as it appears at first sight;--and that for three\r\nreasons: (1) a large share of the books actually published, appear in the\r\nfirst instance in the periodicals in serial or casual form; (2) the\r\nperiodicals contain very much matter of permanent value; (3) the steady\r\nincrease of carefully prepared books in the publishing world, while it\r\nmay not keep pace with the rapid increase of periodicals, evinces a\r\ngrowth in the right direction. It is no longer so easy to get a crude or\r\na poor book published, as it was a generation ago. The standard of\r\ncritical taste has risen, and far more readers are judges of what\r\nconstitutes a really good book than ever before. While it is true that\r\nour periodical product has so grown, that whereas there were twenty years\r\nago, in 1878, only 7,958 different newspapers and magazines published in\r\nthe United States, there are now, in 1899, over 20,500 issued, it can\r\nalso be stated that the annual product of books has increased in the same\r\ntwenty years from less than two thousand to more than five thousand\r\nvolumes of new issues in a year. Whatever may be the future of our\r\nAmerican literature, it can hardly be doubted that the tendency is\r\nsteadily toward the production of more books, and better ones.\r\n\r\nWhether a public library be large or small, its value to students will\r\ndepend greatly upon the care and completeness with which its selection of\r\nperiodical works is made, and kept up from year to year. Nothing is more\r\ncommon in all libraries, public and private, than imperfect and partially\r\nbound sets of serials, whether newspapers, reviews, magazines or the\r\nproceedings and reports of scientific and other societies. Nothing can be\r\nmore annoying than to find the sets of such publications broken at the\r\nvery point where the reference or the wants of those consulting them\r\nrequire satisfaction. In these matters, perpetual vigilance is the price\r\nof completeness; and the librarian who is not willing or able to devote\r\nthe time and means requisite to complete the files of periodical\r\npublications under his charge is to be censured or commiserated,\r\naccording to the causes of the failure. The first essential in keeping up\r\nthe completeness of files of ephemeral publications, next to vigilance on\r\nthe part of their custodian, is room for the arrangement of the various\r\nparts, and means for binding with promptitude. Some libraries, and among\r\nthem a few of the largest, are so hampered for want of room, that their\r\nserials are piled in heaps without order or arrangement, and are thus\r\ncomparatively useless until bound. In the more fortunate institutions,\r\nwhich possess adequate space for the orderly arrangement of all their\r\nstores, there can be no excuse for failing to supply any periodical,\r\nwhether bound or unbound, at the moment it is called for. It is simply\r\nnecessary to devote sufficient time each day to the systematic\r\narrangement of all receipts: to keep each file together in chronological\r\norder; to supply them for the perusal of readers, with a proper check or\r\nreceipt, and to make sure of binding each new volume as fast as the\r\npublication of titles and index enables it to be done properly. While\r\nsome libraries receive several thousands of serials, the periodical\r\npublications taken by others amount to a very small number; but in either\r\ncase, the importance of prompt collation and immediate supply of missing\r\nparts or numbers is equally imperative. While deficiencies in daily\r\nnewspapers can rarely be made up after the week, and sometimes not after\r\nthe day of their appearance, the missing parts of official and other\r\npublications, as well as of reviews and magazines appearing at less\r\nfrequent intervals, can usually be supplied within the year, although a\r\nmore prompt securing of them is often necessary. In these publications,\r\nas in the acquisition of books for any library, the collation of each\r\npart or number is imperative, in order to avoid imperfections which may\r\nbe irreparable.\r\n\r\nFirst in the ranks of these ephemeral publications, in order of number,\r\nif not of importance, come the journals of all classes, daily and weekly,\r\npolitical, illustrated, literary, scientific, mechanical, professional,\r\nagricultural, financial, etc. From the obscure and fugitive beginnings of\r\njournalism in the sixteenth century to the establishment of the first\r\ncontinuous newspaper--the London Weekly News, in 1622, and Renaudot's\r\nGazette (afterwards the _Gazette de France_) in 1631, followed by the\r\nissue of the first daily newspaper, the London Daily Courant, in 1702,\r\nand the Boston Weekly News-letter in 1704, (the first American\r\njournal)--to the wonderful fecundity of the modern periodical press,\r\nwhich scatters the leaves of more than thirty thousand different journals\r\nbroadcast over the world, there is a long and interesting history of the\r\ntrials and triumphs of a free press. In whatever respect American\r\nlibraries may fall behind those of older lands (and their deficiencies\r\nare vast, and, in many directions permanent) it may be said with\r\nconfidence, that in the United States the newspaper has received its\r\nwidest and most complete development. Numerically, the fullest\r\napproximate return of the newspaper and periodical press gives a total\r\nnumber of 21,500 periodical publications, regularly appearing within the\r\nlimits of the United States.\r\n\r\nWhile no one library, however large and comprehensive, has either the\r\nspace or the means to accumulate a tithe of the periodicals that swarm\r\nfrom a productive press, there are valid reasons why more attention\r\nshould be paid by the librarian to a careful preservation of a wise\r\nselection of the best of all this current literature. The modern\r\nnewspaper and other periodical publications afford the fullest and\r\ntruest, and on the whole, the most impartial image of the age we live in,\r\nthat can be derived from a single source. Taken together, they afford the\r\nrichest material for the historian, or the student of politics, of\r\nsociety, of literature, and of civilization in all its varied aspects.\r\nWhat precious memorials of the day, even the advertisements and brief\r\nparagraphs of the newspapers of a century ago afford us! While in a field\r\nso vast, it is impossible for any one library to be more than a gleaner,\r\nno such institution can afford to neglect the collection and preservation\r\nof at least some of the more important newspapers from year to year. A\r\npublic library is not for one generation only, but it is for all time.\r\nOpportunities once neglected of securing the current periodicals of any\r\nage in continuous and complete form seldom or never recur. The principle\r\nof selection will of course vary in different libraries and localities.\r\nWhile the safest general rule is to secure the best and most\r\nrepresentative of all the journals, reviews, and magazines within the\r\nlimit of the funds which can be devoted to that purpose, there is another\r\nprinciple which should largely guide the selection. In each locality, it\r\nshould be one leading object of the principal library to gather within\r\nits walls the fullest representation possible, of the literature relating\r\nto its own State and neighborhood. In every city and large town, the\r\nlocal journals and other periodicals should form an indispensable part of\r\na public library collection. Where the means are wanting to purchase\r\nthese, the proprietors will frequently furnish them free of expense, for\r\npublic use; but no occasion should be lost of securing, immediately on\r\nits issue from the press, every publication, large or small, which\r\nrelates to the local history or interests of the place where the library\r\nis maintained.\r\n\r\nWhile the files of the journals of any period furnish unquestionably the\r\nbest instruments for the history of that epoch, it is lamentable to\r\nreflect that so little care has ever been taken to preserve a fair\r\nrepresentation of those of any age. The destiny of nearly all newspapers\r\nis swift destruction; and even those which are preserved, commonly\r\nsurvive in a lamentably fragmentary state. The obvious causes of the\r\nrapid disappearance of periodical literature, are its great volume,\r\nnecessarily increasing with every year, the difficulty of lodging the\r\nfiles of any long period in our narrow apartments, and the continual\r\ndemand for paper for the uses of trade. To these must be added the great\r\ncost of binding files of journals, increasing in the direct ratio of the\r\nsize of the volume. As so formidable an expense can be incurred by very\r\nfew private subscribers to periodicals, so much the more important is it\r\nthat the public libraries should not neglect a duty which they owe to\r\ntheir generation, as well as to those that are to follow. These poor\r\njournals of to-day, which everybody is willing to stigmatize as trash,\r\nnot worth the room to store or the money to bind, are the very materials\r\nwhich the man of the future will search for with eagerness, and for some\r\nof which he will be ready to pay their weight in gold. These\r\nrepresentatives of the commercial, industrial, inventive, social,\r\nliterary, political, moral and religious life of the times, should be\r\npreserved and handed down to posterity with sedulous care. No historian\r\nor other writer on any subject who would write conscientiously or with\r\nfull information, can afford to neglect this fruitful mine of the\r\njournals, where his richest materials are frequently to be found.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of any great library of journals, or of that universal\r\nlibrary which every nation should possess, it becomes the more important\r\nto assemble in the various local libraries all those ephemeral\r\npublications, which, if not thus preserved contemporaneously with their\r\nissue, will disappear utterly, and elude the search of future historical\r\ninquirers. And that library which shall most sedulously gather and\r\npreserve such fugitive memorials of the life of the people among which it\r\nis situated will be found to have best subserved its purpose to the\r\nsucceeding generations of men.\r\n\r\nNot less important than the preservation of newspapers is that of reviews\r\nand magazines. In fact, the latter are almost universally recognized as\r\nfar more important than the more fugitive literature of the daily and\r\nweekly press. Though inferior to the journals as historical and\r\nstatistical materials, reviews and magazines supply the largest fund of\r\ndiscussion concerning such topics of scientific, social, literary, and\r\nreligious interest as occupy the public mind during the time in which\r\nthey appear. More and more the best thought of the times gets reflected\r\nin the pages of this portion of the periodical press. No investigator in\r\nany department can afford to overlook the rich stores contributed to\r\nthought in reviews and magazines. These articles are commonly more\r\ncondensed and full of matter than the average books of the period. While\r\nevery library, therefore, should possess for the current use and ultimate\r\nreference of its readers a selection of the best, as large as its means\r\nwill permit, a great and comprehensive library, in order to be\r\nrepresentative of the national literature, should possess them all.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe salient fact that the periodical press absorbs, year by year, more of\r\nthe talent which might otherwise be expended upon literature of more\r\npermanent form is abundantly obvious. This tendency has both its good and\r\nits evil results. On the one hand, the best writing ability is often\r\ndrawn out by magazines and journals, which are keen competitors for\r\nattractive matter, and for known reputations, and sometimes they secure\r\nboth in combination. On the other hand, it is a notable fact that writers\r\ncapable of excellent work often do great injustice to their reputations\r\nby producing too hastily articles written to order, instead of the\r\nwell-considered, ripe fruits of their literary skill. Whether the brief\r\narticle answering the limits of a magazine or a review is apt to be more\r\nor less superficial than a book treating the same topic, is a question\r\nadmitting of different views. If the writer is capable of skilful\r\ncondensation, without loss of grace of composition, or of graphic power,\r\nthen the article, measured by its influence upon the public mind, must be\r\npreferred to the more diffuse treatise of the book. It has the immense\r\nadvantage of demanding far less of the reader's time; and whenever its\r\nconclusions are stated in a masterly way, its impression should be quite\r\nas lasting as that of any book treating a similar theme. Such is\r\ndoubtless the effect of the abler articles written for periodicals, which\r\nare more condensed and full of matter in speedily available form, than\r\nthe average book of the period. In this sense it is a misuse of terms to\r\ncall the review article ephemeral, or to treat the periodicals containing\r\nthem as perishable literary commodities, which serve their term with the\r\nmonth or year that produced them. On the contrary, the experience of\r\nlibrarians shows that the most sought-for, and the most useful\r\ncontributions to any subject are frequently found, not in the books\r\nwritten upon it, but in the files of current periodicals, or in those of\r\nformer years. It is especially to be noted that the book may frequently\r\nlose its adaptation and usefulness by lapse of time, and the onward march\r\nof science, while the article is apt to reflect the latest light which\r\ncan help to illustrate the subject.\r\n\r\nWhile, therefore, there is always a liability of finding many crude and\r\nsketchy contributions in the literature of the periodical press, its\r\nconductors are ever on the alert to reduce to a minimum the weak or\r\nunworthy offerings, and to secure a maximum of articles embodying mature\r\nthought and fit expression. The pronounced tendency toward short methods\r\nin every channel of human activity, is reflected in the constantly\r\nmultiplying series of periodical publications.\r\n\r\nThe publishing activities of the times are taking on a certain\r\ncoöperative element, which was not formerly known. Thus, the \"literary\r\nsyndicate\" has been developed by degrees into one of the most\r\nfar-reaching agencies for popular entertainment. The taste for short\r\nstories, in place of the ancient three volume novel, has been cultivated\r\neven in conservative England, and has become so wide-spread in the United\r\nStates, that very few periodicals which deal in fiction at all, are\r\nwithout their stories begun and finished in a single issue. The talent\r\nrequired to produce a fascinating and successful fiction in this narrow\r\ncompass is a peculiar one, and while there are numerous failures, there\r\nare also a surprising number of successes. Well written descriptive\r\narticles, too, are in demand, and special cravings for personal gossip\r\nand lively sketches of notable living characters are manifest. That\r\nperennial interest which mankind and womankind evince in every individual\r\nwhose name, for whatever reason, has become familiar, supplies a basis\r\nfor an inexhaustible series of light paragraphic articles. Another\r\nfruitful field for the syndicate composition is brief essays upon any\r\ntopic of the times, the fashions, notable events, or new inventions,\r\npublic charities, education, governmental doings, current political\r\nmovements, etc. These appear almost simultaneously, in many different\r\nperiodicals, scattered throughout the country, under the copyright\r\n_imprimatur_, which warns off all journals from republishing, which have\r\nnot subscribed to the special \"syndicate\" engaging them. Thus each\r\nperiodical secures, at extremely moderate rates, contributions which are\r\nfrequently written by the most noted and popular living writers, who, in\r\ntheir turn, are much better remunerated for their work than they would be\r\nfor the same amount of writing if published in book form. Whether this\r\nnow popular method of attaining a wide and remunerative circulation for\r\ntheir productions will prove permanent, is less certain than that many\r\nauthors now find it the surest road to profitable employment of their\r\npens. The fact that it rarely serves to introduce unknown writers of\r\ntalent to the reading world, may be laid to the account of the eagerness\r\nof the syndicates to secure names that already enjoy notoriety.\r\n\r\nThe best method for filing newspapers for current reading is a vexed\r\nquestion in libraries. In the large ones, where room enough exists, large\r\nreading-stands with sloping sides furnish the most convenient access,\r\nprovided with movable metal rods to keep the papers in place. Where no\r\nroom exists for these stands, some of the numerous portable\r\nnewspaper-file inventions, or racks, may be substituted, allowing one to\r\neach paper received at the library.\r\n\r\nFor filing current magazines, reviews, and the smaller newspapers, like\r\nthe literary and technical journals, various plans are in use. All of\r\nthese have advantages, while none is free from objection. Some libraries\r\nuse the ordinary pamphlet case, in which the successive numbers are kept\r\nuntil a volume is accumulated for binding. This requires a separate case\r\nfor each periodical, and where many are taken, is expensive, though by\r\nthis method the magazines are kept neat and in order. Others use small\r\nnewspaper files or tapes for periodicals. Others still arrange them\r\nalphabetically on shelves, in which case the latest issues are found on\r\ntop, if the chronology is preserved. In serving periodicals to readers,\r\ntickets should be required (as for books) with title and date, as a\r\nprecaution against loss, or careless leaving upon tables.\r\n\r\nWhether current periodicals are ever allowed to be drawn out, must depend\r\nupon several weighty considerations. When only one copy is taken, no\r\ncirculation should be permitted, so that the magazines and journals may\r\nbe always in, at the service of readers frequenting the library. But in\r\nsome large public libraries, where several copies of each of the more\r\npopular serials are subscribed to, it is the custom to keep one copy\r\n(sometimes two) always in, and to allow the duplicate copies to be drawn\r\nout. This circulation should be limited to a period much shorter than is\r\nallowed for keeping books.\r\n\r\nIn no case, should the bound volumes of magazines, reviews, and journals\r\nof whatever kind be allowed to leave the library. This is a rule which\r\nshould be enforced for the common benefit of all the readers, since to\r\nlend to one reader any periodical or work of general reference is to\r\ndeprive all the rest of its use just so long as it is out of the library.\r\nThis has become all the more important since the publication of Poole's\r\nIndexes to periodical literature has put the whole reading community on\r\nthe quest for information to be found only (in condensed form, or in the\r\nlatest treatment) in the volumes of the periodical press. And it is\r\nreally no hardship to any quick, intelligent reader, to require that\r\nthese valuable serials should be used within the library only. An article\r\nis not like a book;--a long and perhaps serious study, requiring many\r\nhours or days to master it. The magazine or review article, whatever\r\nother virtues it may lack, has the supreme merit of brevity.\r\n\r\nThe only valid exception which will justify loaning the serial volumes of\r\nperiodicals outside the library, is when there are duplicate sets of any\r\nof them. Some large libraries having a wide popular circulation are able\r\nto buy two or more sets of the magazines most in demand, and so to lend\r\none out, while another is kept constantly in for use and reference. And\r\neven a library of small means might secure for its shelves duplicate sets\r\nof many periodicals, by simply making known that it would be glad to\r\nreceive from any families or other owners, all the numbers of their\r\nmagazines, etc., which they no longer need for use. This would bring in,\r\nin any large town or city, a copious supply of periodicals which\r\nhouse-keepers, tired of keeping, storing and dusting such unsightly\r\nproperty, would be glad to bestow where they would do the most good.\r\n\r\nWhatever periodicals are taken, it is essential to watch over their\r\ncompleteness by keeping a faithfully revised check-list. This should be\r\nruled to furnish blank spaces for each issue of all serials taken,\r\nwhether quarterly, monthly, weekly, or daily, and no week should elapse\r\nwithout complete scrutiny of the list, and ordering all missing numbers\r\nfrom the publishers. Mail failures are common, and unceasing vigilance is\r\nthe price that must be paid for completeness. The same check-list, by\r\nother spaces, should show the time of expiration of subscriptions, and\r\nthe price paid per year. And where a large number of periodicals are\r\nreceived, covering many parts of the country, they should be listed, not\r\nonly by an alphabet of titles, but by another alphabet of places where\r\npublished, as well.\r\n\r\nIf a new library is to be formed, having no sets of periodicals on which\r\nto build, effort should be made to secure full sets from the beginning of\r\nas many of the prominent magazines and reviews, American and foreign, as\r\nthe funds will permit. It is expedient to wait a little, rather than to\r\ntake up with incomplete sets, as full ones are pretty sure to turn up,\r\nand competition between the many dealers should bring down prices to a\r\nfair medium. In fact, many old sets of magazines are offered surprisingly\r\ncheap, and usually well-bound. But vigilant care must be exercised to\r\nsecure perfect sets, as numbers are often mutilated, or deficient in some\r\npages or illustrations. This object can only be secured by collation of\r\nevery volume, page by page, with due attention to the list of\r\nillustrations, if any are published.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of British bibliographical enterprise (a want much to be\r\ndeplored) it has fallen to the lot of American librarians to produce the\r\nonly general index of subjects to English periodical literature which\r\nexists. Poole's Index to Periodical Literature is called by the name of\r\nits senior editor, the late Dr. Wm. F. Poole, and was contributed to by\r\nmany librarians on a coöperative division of labor, in indexing, under\r\ndirection of Mr. Wm. I. Fletcher, librarian of Amherst College. This\r\nindex to leading periodicals is literally invaluable, and indispensable\r\nas an aid to research. Its first volume indexes in one alphabet the\r\nperiodicals embraced, from their first issues up to 1882. The second\r\nvolume runs from 1882 to 1887, and the third covers the period from 1887\r\nto 1891, while a fourth volume indexes the periodicals from 1892 to 1896,\r\ninclusive. For 1897, and each year after, an annual index to the\r\npublications of the year is issued.\r\n\r\nBesides this, the _Review of Reviews_ publishes monthly an index to one\r\nmonth's leading periodicals, and also an annual index, very full, in a\r\nsingle alphabet. And the \"Cumulative Index,\" issued both monthly and\r\nquarterly, by W. H. Brett, the Cleveland, Ohio, librarian, is an\r\nadmirably full means of keeping our keys to periodical literature up to\r\ndate. There are other indexes to periodicals, published monthly or\r\nquarterly, too numerous to be noticed here. The annual _New York Tribune_\r\nIndex (the only daily journal, except the _London Times_, which prints an\r\nindex) is highly useful, and may be used for other newspapers as well,\r\nfor the most important events or discussions, enabling one to search the\r\ndailies for himself, the date once being fixed by aid of the index.\r\n\r\nMention should also be made here of the admirably comprehensive annual\r\n\"_Rowell's Newspaper Directory_,\" which should rather be called the\r\n\"American Periodical Directory,\" since it has a classified catalogue of\r\nall periodicals published in the United States and Canada.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 9.\r\n\r\nTHE ART OF READING.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The true University of these days,\" says a great scholar of our century,\r\nThomas Carlyle, \"is a collection of books, and all education is to teach\r\nus how to read.\"\r\n\r\nIf there were any volume, out of the multitude of books about books that\r\nhave been written, which could illuminate the pathway of the unskilled\r\nreader, so as to guide him into all knowledge by the shortest road, what\r\na boon that book would be!\r\n\r\nWhen we survey the vast and rapidly growing product of the modern\r\npress,--when we see these hosts of poets without imagination, historians\r\nwithout accuracy, critics without discernment, and novelists without\r\ninvention or style, in short, the whole prolific brood of writers who do\r\nnot know how to write,--we are tempted to echo the sentiment of\r\nWordsworth:--\r\n\r\n    \"The intellectual power, through words and things,\r\n     Goes sounding on a dim and perilous way.\"\r\n\r\nThe most that any one can hope to do for others is to suggest to them a\r\nclue which, however feeble, has helped to guide his uncertain footsteps\r\nthrough the labyrinthian maze of folly and wisdom which we call\r\nliterature.\r\n\r\nThe knowledge acquired by a Librarian, while it may be very wide and very\r\nvaried, runs much risk of being as superficial as it is diversified.\r\nThere is a very prevalent, but very erroneous notion which conceives of a\r\nlibrarian as a kind of animated encyclopaedia, who, if you tap him in any\r\ndirection, from A to Z, will straightway pour forth a flood of knowledge\r\nupon any subject in history, science, or literature. This popular ideal,\r\nhowever fine in theory, has to undergo what commercial men call a heavy\r\ndiscount when reduced to practice. The librarian is a constant and busy\r\nworker in far other fields than exploring the contents of books. His day\r\nis filled with cataloguing, arranging and classifying them, searching\r\ncatalogues, selecting new books, correspondence, directing assistants,\r\nkeeping library records, adjusting accounts, etc., in the midst of which\r\nhe is constantly at the call of the public for books and information.\r\nWhat time has he, wearied by the day's multifarious and exacting labors,\r\nfor any thorough study of books? So, when anyone begins an inquiry with,\r\n\"You know everything; can you tell me,\"--I say: \"Stop a moment;\r\nomniscience is not a human quality; I really know very few things, and am\r\nnot quite sure of some of them.\" There are many men, and women, too, in\r\nalmost every community, whose range of knowledge is more extended than\r\nthat of most librarians.\r\n\r\nThe idea, then, that because one lives perpetually among books, he\r\nabsorbs all the learning that they contain, must be abandoned as a\r\npopular delusion. To know a little upon many subjects is quite compatible\r\nwith not knowing much about any one. \"Beware of the man of one book,\" is\r\nan ancient proverb, pregnant with meaning. The man of one book, if it is\r\nwisely chosen, and if he knows it all, can sometimes confound a whole\r\nassembly of scholars. An American poet once declared to me that all\r\nleisure time is lost that is not spent in reading Shakespeare. And we\r\nremember Emerson's panegyric upon Plato's writings, borrowing from the\r\nCaliph Omar his famous (but apocryphal) sentence against all books but\r\nthe Koran: \"Burn all the libraries, for their value is in this book.\" So\r\nSheffield, duke of Buckingham:\r\n\r\n    \"Read Homer once, and you can read no more,\r\n     For all books else appear so tame, so poor,\r\n     Verse will seem prose, but still persist to read,\r\n     And Homer will be all the books you need.\"\r\n\r\nOf course I am far from designing to say anything against the widest\r\nstudy, which great libraries exist to supply and to encourage; and all\r\nutterances of a half-truth, like the maxim I have quoted, are\r\nexaggerations. But the saying points a moral--and that is, the supreme\r\nimportance of thoroughness in all that we undertake. The poetical\r\nwiseacre who endowed the world with the maxim, \"A little learning is a\r\ndangerous thing,\" does not appear to have reflected upon the logical\r\nsequence of the dictum, namely: that if a little learning upon any\r\nsubject is dangerous, then less must be still more dangerous.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe art of reading to the best advantage implies the command of adequate\r\ntime to read. The art of having time to read depends upon knowing how to\r\nmake the best use of our days. Days are short, and time is fleeting, but\r\nno one's day ever holds less than 24 hours. Engrossing as one's\r\noccupation may be, it need never consume all the time remaining from\r\nsleep, refreshment and social intercourse. The half hour before\r\nbreakfast, the fifteen minutes waiting for dinner, given to the book you\r\nwish to read, will soon finish it, and make room for another. The busiest\r\nmen I have known have often been the most intelligent, and the widest\r\nreaders. The idle person never knows how to make use of odd moments; the\r\nbusy one always knows how. Yet the vast majority of people go through\r\nlife without ever learning the great lesson of the supreme value of\r\nmoments.\r\n\r\nLet us suppose that you determine to devote two hours every day to\r\nreading. That is equivalent to more than seven hundred hours a year, or\r\nto three months of working time of eight hours a day. What could you not\r\ndo in three months, if you had all the time to yourself? You could almost\r\nlearn a new language, or master a new science; yet this two hours a day,\r\nwhich would give you three months of free time every year, is frittered\r\naway, you scarcely know how, in aimless matters that lead to nothing.\r\n\r\nA famous writer of our century, some of whose books you have\r\nread,--Edward Bulwer Lytton,--devoted only four hours a day to writing;\r\nyet he produced more than sixty volumes of fiction, poetry, drama and\r\ncriticism, of singular literary merit. The great naturalist, Darwin, a\r\nchronic sufferer from a depressing malady, counted two hours a fortunate\r\nday's work for him; yet he accomplished results in the world of science\r\nwhich render his name immortal.\r\n\r\nBe not over particular as to hours, or the time of day, and you will soon\r\nfind that all hours are good for the muse. Have a purpose, and adhere to\r\nit with good-humored pertinacity. Be independent of the advice and\r\nopinions of others; the world of books, like the world of nature, was\r\nmade for you; possess it in your own way. If you find no good in ancient\r\nhistory or in metaphysics, let them alone and read books of art, or\r\npoetry, or biography, or voyages and travels. The wide domain of\r\nknowledge and the world of books are so related, that all roads cross and\r\nconverge, like the paths that carry us over the surface of the globe on\r\nwhich we live. Many a reader has learned more of past times from good\r\nbiographies, than from any formal history; and it is a fact that many owe\r\nto the plays of Shakespeare and the novels of Walter Scott nearly all the\r\nknowledge which they possess of the history of England and Scotland.\r\n\r\nIt is unhappily true that books do not teach the use of books. The art of\r\nextracting what is important or instructive in any book, from the mass\r\nof verbiage that commonly overlays it, cannot be learned by theory.\r\nInvaluable as the art of reading is, as a means of enlightenment, its\r\nhighest uses can only be obtained by a certain method of reading, which\r\nwill separate the wheat from the chaff. Different readers will, of\r\ncourse, possess different capacities for doing this. Young or\r\nundisciplined minds can read only in one way,--and that way is, to\r\nmentally pronounce every word, and dwell equally upon all the parts of\r\nevery sentence. This comes naturally in the first instance, from the mere\r\nmethod of learning to read, in which every word is a spoken symbol, and\r\nhas to be sounded, whether it is essential to the sense, or not. This\r\nhabit of reading, which may be termed the literal method, goes with most\r\npersons through life. Once learned, it is very hard to unlearn. There are\r\nmultitudes who cannot read a newspaper, even, without dwelling upon every\r\nword, and coming to a full stop at the end of every sentence. Now this\r\nmethod of reading, while it may be indispensable to all readers at some\r\ntime, and to some readers at all times, is too slow and fruitless for the\r\nstudent who aims to absorb the largest amount of knowledge in the\r\nbriefest space of time. Life is too short to be wasted over the rhetoric\r\nor the periods of an author whose knowledge we want as all that concerns\r\nus.\r\n\r\nDoubtless there are classes of literature in which form or expression\r\npredominates, and we cannot read poetry, for example, or the drama, or\r\neven the higher class of fiction, without lingering upon the finer\r\npassages, to get the full impression of their beauty. In reading works of\r\nthe imagination, we read not for ideas alone, but for expression also,\r\nand to enjoy the rhythm and melody of the verse, if it be poetry, or, if\r\nprose, the finished rhetoric, and the pleasing cadence of the style. It\r\nis here that the literary skill of an accomplished writer, and all that\r\nwe understand by rhetoric, becomes important, while in reading for\r\ninformation only, we may either ignore words and phrases entirely, or\r\nsubordinate them to the ideas which they convey. In reading any book for\r\nthe knowledge it contains, I should as soon think of spelling out all the\r\nwords, as of reading out all the sentences. Just as, in listening to a\r\nslow speaker, you divine the whole meaning of what he is about to say,\r\nbefore he has got half through his sentence, so, in reading, you can\r\ngather the full sense of the ideas which any sentence contains, without\r\nstopping to accentuate the words.\r\n\r\nLeaving aside the purely literary works, in which form or style is a\r\npredominant element, let us come to books of science, history, biography,\r\nvoyages, travels, etc. In these, the primal aim is to convey information,\r\nand thus the style of expression is little or nothing--the thought or the\r\nfact is all. Yet most writers envelop the thought or the fact in so much\r\nverbiage, complicate it with so many episodes, beat it out thin, by so\r\nmuch iteration and reiteration, that the student must needs learn the art\r\nof skipping, in self-defense. To one in zealous pursuit of knowledge, to\r\nread most books through is paying them too extravagant a compliment. He\r\nhas to read between the lines, as it were, to note down a fact here, or a\r\nthought there, or an illustration elsewhere, and leaves alone all that\r\ncontributes nothing to his special purpose. As the quick, practiced eye\r\nglances over the visible signs of thought, page after page is rapidly\r\nabsorbed, and a book which would occupy an ordinary reader many days in\r\nreading, is mastered in a few hours.\r\n\r\nThe habit of reading which I have outlined, and which may be termed the\r\nintuitive method, or, if you prefer it, the short-hand method, will more\r\nthan double the working power of the reader. It is not difficult to\r\npractice, especially to a busy man, who does with all his might what he\r\nhas got to do. But it should be learned early in life, when the faculties\r\nare fresh, the mind full of zeal for knowledge, and the mental habits are\r\nductile, not fixed. With it one's capacity for acquiring knowledge, and\r\nconsequently his accomplishment, whether as writer, teacher, librarian,\r\nor private student, will be immeasureably increased.\r\n\r\nDoubtless it is true that some native or intuitive gifts must be\r\nconjoined with much mental discipline and perseverance, in order to reach\r\nthe highest result, in this method of reading, as in any other study.\r\n\"_Non omnia possumus omnes_,\" Virgil says; and there are intellects who\r\ncould no more master such a method, than they could understand the\r\nbinomial theorem, or calculate the orbit of Uranus. If it be true, as has\r\nbeen epigramatically said, that \"a great book is a great evil,\" let it be\r\nreduced to a small one by the skilful use of the art of skipping. Then,\r\n\"he that runs may read\" as he runs--while, without this refuge, he that\r\nreads will often assuredly be tempted to run.\r\n\r\nWhat I said, just now, in deprecation of set courses of reading, was\r\ndesigned for private students only, who so often find a stereotyped\r\nsequence of books barren or uninteresting. It was not intended to\r\ndiscourage the pursuit of a special course of study in the school, or the\r\nsociety, or the reading class. This is, in fact, one of the best means of\r\nintellectual progress. Here, there is the opportunity to discuss the\r\nstyle, the merits, and the characteristics of the author in hand, and by\r\nthe attrition of mind with mind, to inform and entertain the whole circle\r\nof readers. In an association of this kind, embracing one or two acute\r\nminds, the excellent practice of reading aloud finds its best results.\r\nHere, too, the art of expression becomes important, how to adapt the\r\nsound to the sense, by a just emphasis, intonation, and modulation of the\r\nvoice. In short, the value of a book thus read and discussed, in an\r\nappreciative circle, may be more than doubled to each reader.\r\n\r\nIt is almost literally true that no book, undertaken merely as task work,\r\never helped the reader to knowledge of permanent or material value. How\r\nmany persons, struck by Mr. Emerson's exalted praise of the writings of\r\nPlato, have undertaken to go through the Dialogues. Alas! for the vain\r\nambition to be or to seem learned! After trying to understand the Phaedo,\r\nor falling asleep over the Gorgias, the book has been dropped as hastily\r\nas it was taken up. It was not perceived that in order to enjoy or\r\ncomprehend a philosopher, one must have a capacity for ideas. It requires\r\nalmost as much intelligence to appreciate an idea as to conceive one. One\r\nwill bring nothing home from the most persistent cruise after knowledge,\r\nunless he carries something out. In the realm of learning, we recognize\r\nthe full meaning of that Scripture, that to him that hath, shall be\r\ngiven; and he that hath not, though never so anxious to read and\r\nunderstand Plato, will quickly return to the perusal of his daily\r\nnewspaper.\r\n\r\nIt were easier, perhaps, in one sense, to tell what not to read, than to\r\nrecommend what is best worth reading. In the publishing world, this is\r\nthe age of compilation, not of creation. If we seek for great original\r\nworks, if we must go to the wholesale merchants to buy knowledge, since\r\nretail geniuses are worth but little, one must go back many years for his\r\nmain selection of books. It would not be a bad rule for those who can\r\nread but little, to read no book until it has been published at least a\r\nyear or two. This fever for the newest books is not a wholesome condition\r\nof the mind. And since a selection must indispensably be made, and that\r\nselection must be, for the great mass of readers, so rigid and so small,\r\nwhy should precious time be wasted upon the ephemeral productions of the\r\nhour? What business, for example, has one to be reading Rider Haggard, or\r\nAmélie Rives, or Ian Maclaren, who has never read Homer, or Dante, or\r\neven so much as half-a-dozen plays of Shakespeare?\r\n\r\nOne hears with dismay that about three-fourths of the books drawn from\r\nour popular libraries are novels. Now, while such aimless reading, merely\r\nto be amused, is doubtless better than no reading at all, it is\r\nunquestionably true that over-much reading of fiction, especially at an\r\nearly age, enervates the mind, weakens the will, makes dreamers instead\r\nof thinkers and workers, and fills the imagination with morbid and unreal\r\nviews of life. Yet the vast consumption of novels is due more to the\r\ncheapness and wide diffusion of such works, and the want of wise\r\ndirection in other fields, than to any original tendency on the part of\r\nthe young. People will always read the most, that which is most put\r\nbefore them, if only the style be attractive. The mischief that is done\r\nby improper books is literally immeasureable. The superabundance of cheap\r\nfictions in the markets creates and supplies an appetite which should be\r\ndirected by wise guidance into more improving fields. A two-fold evil\r\nfollows upon the reading of every unworthy book; in the first place, it\r\nabsorbs the time which should be bestowed upon a worthy one; and\r\nsecondly, it leaves the mind and heart unimproved, instead of conducing\r\nto the benefit of both. As there are few books more elevating than a\r\nreally good novel, so there are none more fruitful of evil than a bad\r\none.\r\n\r\nAnd what of the newspaper? it may be asked. When I consider for how much\r\nreally good literature we are beholden to the daily and weekly press, how\r\nindispensable is its function as purveyor of the news of the world, how\r\nwidely it has been improved in recent years, I cannot advise quarreling\r\nwith the bridge that brings so many across the gulf of ignorance. Yet the\r\nnewspaper, like the book, is to be read sparingly, and with judgment. It\r\nis to be used, not abused. I call that an abuse which squanders the\r\nprecious and unreturning hours over long chronicles of depravity. The\r\nmurders, the suicides, the executions, the divorces, the criminal trials,\r\nare each and all so like one another that it is only a wanton waste of\r\ntime to read them. The morbid style in which social disorders of all\r\nkinds are written up in the sensational press, with staring headlines to\r\nattract attention, ought to warn off every healthy mind from their\r\nperusal. Every scandal in society that can be brought to the surface is\r\neagerly caught up and paraded, while the millions of people who lead\r\nblameless lives of course go unnoticed and unchronicled. Such journals\r\nthus inculcate the vilest pessimism, instead of a wholesome and honest\r\nbelief in the average decency of human nature. The prolixity of the\r\nnarrative, too, is always in monstrous disproportion to its importance.\r\n\"Does not the burning of a metropolitan theatre,\" says a great writer,\r\n\"take above a million times as much telling as the creation of a world?\"\r\nHere is where the art of skipping is to be rigorously applied. Read the\r\nnewspaper by headlines only,--skipping all the murders, all the fires,\r\nall the executions, all the crimes, all the news, except the most\r\nimportant and immediately interesting,--and you will spend perhaps\r\nfifteen or twenty minutes upon what would otherwise occupy hours. It is\r\nno exaggeration to say that most persons have spent time enough over the\r\nnewspapers, to have given them a liberal education.\r\n\r\nAs all readers cannot have the same gifts, so all cannot enjoy the same\r\nbooks. There are those who can see no greatness in Shakespeare, but who\r\nthink Tupper's Proverbial Philosophy sublime. Some will eagerly devour\r\nevery novel of Miss Braddon's, or \"The Duchess,\" or the woman calling\r\nherself \"Ouida,\" but they cannot appreciate the masterly fictions of\r\nThackeray. I have known very good people who could not, for the life of\r\nthem, find any humor in Dickens, but who actually enjoyed the strained\r\nwit of Mrs. Partington and Bill Nye. Readers who could not get through a\r\nvolume of Gibbon will read with admiration a so-called History of\r\nNapoleon by Abbott. And I fear that you will find many a young lady of\r\nto-day, who is content to be ignorant of Homer and Shakespeare, but who\r\nis ravished by the charms of \"Trilby\" or the \"Heavenly Twins.\" But taste\r\nin literature, as in art, or in anything else, can be cultivated. Lay\r\ndown the rule, and adhere to it, to read none but the best books, and you\r\nwill soon lose all relish for the poor ones. You can educate readers into\r\ngood judges, in no long time, by feeding them on the masterpieces of\r\nEnglish prose and poetry. Surely, we all have cause to deprecate the\r\nremorseless flood of fictitious literature in which better books are\r\ndrowned.\r\n\r\nBe not dismayed at the vast multitude of books, nor fear that, with your\r\nsmall leisure, you will never be able to master any appreciable share of\r\nthem. Few and far between are the great books of the world. The works\r\nwhich it is necessary to know, may be comprised in a comparatively small\r\ncompass. The rest are to be preserved in the great literary\r\nconservatories, some as records of the past, others as chronicles of the\r\ntimes, and not a few as models to be avoided. The Congressional Library\r\nat Washington is our great National conservatory of books. As the library\r\nof the government--that is, of the whole people,--it is inclusive of all\r\nthe literature which the country produces, while all the other libraries\r\nare and must be more or less exclusive. No National Library can ever be\r\ntoo large. In order that the completeness of the collection shall not\r\nfail, and to preserve the whole of our literature, it is put into the\r\nStatute of Copyright, as a condition precedent of the exclusive right to\r\nmultiply copies of any book, that it shall be deposited in the Library of\r\nCongress. Apprehension is sometimes expressed that our National Library\r\nwill become overloaded with trash, and so fail of its usefulness. 'Tis a\r\nlost fear. There is no act of Congress requiring all the books to be\r\nread. The public sense is continually winnowing and sifting the\r\nliterature of every period, and to books and their authors, every day is\r\nthe day of judgment. Nowhere in the world is the inexorable law of the\r\nsurvival of the fittest more rigidly applied than in the world of books.\r\nThe works which are the most frequently re-printed in successive ages are\r\nthe ones which it is safe to stand by.\r\n\r\nBooks may be divided into three classes: 1st, acquaintances; 2d, friends;\r\nand 3d, intimates.\r\n\r\nIt is well enough to have an acquaintance with a multitude of books, as\r\nwith many people; though in either case much time should not be given to\r\nmerely pleasant intercourse, that leads to no result. With our literary\r\nfriends, we can spend more time, for they awaken keen interest, and are\r\nto be read with zest, and consequently with profit. But for our chosen\r\nintimates, our heart-companions, we reserve our highest regard, and our\r\nbest hours. Choice and sacred is the book that makes an era in the life\r\nof the reader; the book which first rouses his higher nature, and awakens\r\nthe reason or the imagination. Such a volume will many a one remember;\r\nthe book which first excited his own thought, made him conscious of\r\nuntried powers, and opened to his charmed vision a new world.\r\n\r\nSuch a book has Carlyle's Sartor Resartus been to many; or the play of\r\nHamlet, read for the first time; or the Faust of Goethe; or the\r\nConfessions of St. Augustine; or an essay of Emerson; or John Ruskin; or\r\nthe Divine Comedy of Dante; or even an exquisite work of fiction, like\r\nJohn Halifax, or Henry Esmond. What the book is that works such miracles\r\nis never of so much importance as the epoch in the mind of the reader\r\nwhich it signalizes. It were vain to single out any one writer, and say\r\nto all readers--\"Here is the book that must indispensably be read;\" for\r\nthe same book will have totally different effects upon different minds,\r\nor even upon the same mind, at different stages of development.\r\n\r\nWhen I have been asked to contribute to the once popular _symposia_ upon\r\n\"Books which have helped me,\"--I have declined, for such catalogues of\r\nintellectual aids are liable to be very misleading. Thus, if I were to\r\nname the book which did more than most others for my own mind, I should\r\nsay that it was the Emile of Rousseau, read at about the age of\r\nseventeen. This work, written with that marvellous eloquence which\r\ncharacterises all the best productions of Jean Jacques, first brought me\r\nacquainted with those advanced ideas of education which have penetrated\r\nthe whole modern world. Yet the Emile would probably appear to most of my\r\nreaders trite and common-place, as it would now to me, for the reason\r\nthat we have long passed the period of development when its ideas were\r\nnew to us.\r\n\r\nBut the formative power of books can never be over-rated: their subtle\r\nmastery to stimulate all the germs of intellectual and moral life that\r\nlie enfolded in the mind. As the poet sings--\r\n\r\n    \"Books are not seldom talismans and spells.\"\r\n\r\nWhy should they not be so? They furnish us the means, and the only\r\nmeans, whereby we may hold communion with the master-spirits of all ages.\r\nThey bring us acquainted with the best thoughts which the human mind has\r\nproduced, expressed in the noblest language. Books create for us the\r\nmany-sided world, carry us abroad, out of our narrow provincial horizons,\r\nand reveal to us new scenery, new men, new languages, and new modes of\r\nlife. As we read, the mind expands with the horizon, and becomes broad as\r\nthe blue heaven above us. With Homer, we breathe the fresh air of the\r\npristine world, when the light of poetry gilded every mountain top, and\r\npeopled the earth with heroes and demigods. With Plutarch, we walk in\r\ncompany with sages, warriors, and statesmen, and kindle with admiration\r\nof their virtues, or are roused to indignation at their crimes. With\r\nSophocles, we sound the depths of human passion, and learn the sublime\r\nlesson of endurance. We are charmed with an ode of Horace, perfect in\r\nrhythm, perfect in sentiment, perfect in diction, and perfect in moral;\r\nthe condensed essence of volumes in a single page. We walk with Dante\r\nthrough the nether world, awed by the tremendous power with which he\r\ndepicts for us the secrets of the prison house. With Milton, we mount\r\nheaven-ward, and in the immortal verse of his minor poems, finer even\r\nthan the stately march of Paradise Lost, we hear celestial music, and\r\nbreathe diviner air. With that sovereign artist, Shakespeare, full\r\nequally of delight and of majesty, we sweep the horizon of this complex\r\nhuman life, and become comprehensive scholars and citizens of the world.\r\nThe masters of fiction enthrall us with their fascinating pages, one\r\nmoment shaking us with uncontrollable laughter, and the next, dissolving\r\nus in tears. In the presence of all these emanations of genius, the wise\r\nreader may feed on nectar and ambrosia, and forget the petty cares and\r\nvexations of to-day.\r\n\r\nThere are some books that charm us by their wit or their sweetness,\r\nothers that surprise and captivate us by their strength: books that\r\nrefresh us when weary: books that comfort us when afflicted: books that\r\nstimulate us by their robust health: books that exalt and refine our\r\nnatures, as it were, to a finer mould: books that rouse us like the sound\r\nof a trumpet: books that illumine the darkest hours, and fill all our day\r\nwith delight.\r\n\r\nIt is books that record the advance and the decline of nations, the\r\nexperience of the world, the achievements and the possibilities of\r\nmankind. It is books that reveal to us ideas and images almost above\r\nourselves, and go far to open for us the gates of the invisible. \"A river\r\nof thought,\" says Emerson, \"is continually flowing out of the invisible\r\nworld into the mind of man:\" and we may add that books contain the most\r\nfruitful and permanent of the currents of that mighty river.\r\n\r\nI am not disposed to celebrate the praises of all books, nor to recommend\r\nto readers of any age a habit of indiscriminate reading: but for the\r\nbooks which are true helpers and teachers, the thoughts of the best\r\npoets, historians, publicists, philosophers, orators,--if their value is\r\nnot real, then there are no realities in the world.\r\n\r\nVery true is it, nevertheless, that the many-sided man cannot be\r\ncultivated by books alone. One may learn by heart whole libraries, and\r\nyet be profoundly unacquainted with the face of nature, or the life of\r\nman. The pale student who gives himself wholly to books pays the penalty\r\nby losing that robust energy of character, that sympathy with his kind,\r\nthat keen sense of the charms of earth and sky, that are essential to\r\ncomplete development. \"The world's great men,\" says Oliver Wendell\r\nHolmes, \"have not commonly been great scholars, nor its scholars great\r\nmen.\" To know what other men have said about things is not always the\r\nmost important part of knowledge. There is nothing that can dispense us\r\nfrom the independent use of our own faculties. Meditation and observation\r\nare more valuable than mere absorption; and knowledge itself is not\r\nwisdom. The true way to use books is to make them our servants--not our\r\nmasters. Very helpful, cheering, and profitable will they become, when\r\nthey fall naturally into our daily life and growth--when they tally with\r\nthe moods of the mind.\r\n\r\nThe habits and methods of readers are as various as those of authors.\r\nThus, there are some readers who gobble a book, as Boswell tells us Dr.\r\nJohnson used to gobble his dinner--eagerly, and with a furious appetite,\r\nsuggestive of dyspepsia, and the non-assimilation of food. Then there are\r\nslow readers, who plod along through a book, sentence by sentence,\r\nputting in a mark conscientiously where they left off to-day, so as to\r\nbegin at the self-same spot to-morrow; fast readers, who gallop through a\r\nbook, as you would ride a flying bicycle on a race; drowsy readers, to\r\nwhom a book is only a covert apology for a nap, and who pretend to be\r\nreading Macaulay or Herbert Spencer only to dream between the leaves;\r\nsensitive readers, who cannot abide the least noise or interruption when\r\nreading, and to whose nerves a foot-fall or a conversation is an\r\nexquisite torture; absorbed readers, who are so pre-occupied with their\r\npursuit that they forget all their surroundings--the time of day, the\r\npresence or the voices of others, the hour for dinner, and even their own\r\nexistence; credulous readers, who believe everything they read because it\r\nis printed in a book, and swallow without winking the most colossal\r\nlying; critical and captious readers, who quarrel with the blunders or\r\nthe beliefs of their author, and who cannot refrain from calling him an\r\nidiot or an ass--and perhaps even writing him down so on his own pages;\r\nadmiring and receptive readers, who find fresh beauties in a favorite\r\nauthor every time they peruse him, and even discover beautiful swans in\r\nthe stupidest geese that ever cackled along the flowery meads of\r\nliterature; reverent readers, who treat a book as they would treat a\r\ngreat and good man, considerately and politely, carefully brushing the\r\ndust from a beloved volume with the sleeve, or tenderly lifting a book\r\nfallen to the floor, as if they thought it suffered, or felt harm;\r\ncareless and rough readers, who will turn down books on their faces to\r\nkeep the place, tumble them over in heaps, cram them into shelves never\r\nmeant for them, scribble upon the margins, dogs-ear the leaves, or even\r\ncut them with their fingers--all brutal and intolerable practices,\r\ntotally unworthy of any one pretending to civilization.\r\n\r\nTo those who have well learned the art of reading, what inexhaustible\r\ndelights does the world of books contain! With Milton, \"to behold the\r\nbright countenance of truth, in the quiet and still air of delightful\r\nstudies;\" to journey through far countries with Marco Polo; to steer\r\nacross an unknown sea with Columbus, or to brave the dangers of the\r\nfrozen ocean with Nansen or Dr. Kane; to study the manners of ancient\r\nnations with Herodotus; to live over again the life of Greece and Rome\r\nwith Plutarch's heroes; to trace the decline of empires with Gibbon and\r\nMommsen; to pursue the story of the modern world in the pages of Hume,\r\nMacaulay, Thiers and Sismondi, and our own Prescott, Motley, and\r\nBancroft; to enjoy afresh the eloquence of Demosthenes, and the polished\r\nand splendid diction of Cicero; to drink in the wisdom of philosophers,\r\nand to walk with Socrates, Plato and the stoics through the groves of\r\nAcademia; to be kindled by the saintly utterances of prophets and\r\napostles, St. Paul's high reasoning of immortality, or the seraphic\r\nvisions of St. John; to study the laws that govern communities with the\r\ngreat publicists, or the economy of nations with Adam Smith and Stuart\r\nMill; with the naturalists, to sound the depths of the argument as to the\r\norigin of species and the genesis of man; with the astronomers, to leave\r\nthe narrow bounds of earth, and explore the illimitable spaces of the\r\nuniverse, in which our solar system is but a speck; with the\r\nmathematicians, to quit the uncertain realm of speculation and\r\nassumption, and plant our feet firmly on the rock of exact science:--to\r\ncome back anon to lighter themes, and to revel in the grotesque humor of\r\nDickens, the philosophic page of Bulwer, the chivalric romances of Walter\r\nScott, the ideal creations of Hawthorne, the finished life-pictures of\r\nGeorge Eliot, the powerful imagination of Victor Hugo, and the masterly\r\ndelineations of Thackeray; to hang over the absorbing biographies of Dr.\r\nFranklin, Walter Scott and Dr. Johnson; to peruse with fresh delight the\r\nmasterpieces of Irving and Goldsmith, and the best essays of Hazlitt, De\r\nQuincey, Charles Lamb, and Montaigne; to feel the inspiration of the\r\ngreat poets of all ages, from Homer down to Tennyson; to read\r\nShakespeare--a book that is in itself almost a university:--is not all\r\nthis satisfaction enough for human appetite, however craving, solace\r\nenough for trouble, however bitter, occupation enough for life, however\r\nlong?\r\n\r\nThere are pleasures that perish in the using; but the pleasure which the\r\nart of reading carries with it is perennial. He who can feast on the\r\nintellectual spoils of centuries need fear neither poverty nor hunger. In\r\nthe society of those immortals who still rule our spirits from their\r\nurns, we become assured that though heaven and earth may pass away, no\r\ntrue thought shall ever pass away.\r\n\r\nThe great orator, on whose lips once hung multitudes, dies and is\r\nforgotten; the great actor passes swiftly off the stage, and is seen no\r\nmore; the great singer, whose voice charmed listening crowds by its\r\nmelody, is hushed in the grave; the great preacher survives but a single\r\ngeneration in the memory of men; all we who now live and act must be, in\r\na little while, with yesterday's seven thousand years:--but the book of\r\nthe great writer lives on and on, inspiring age after age of readers, and\r\nhas in it more of the seeds of immortality than anything upon earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 10.\r\n\r\nAIDS TO READERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is one venerable Latin proverb which deserves a wider recognition\r\nthan it has yet received. It is to the effect that \"the best part of\r\nlearning is to know where to find things.\" From lack of this knowledge,\r\nan unskilled reader will often spend hours in vainly searching for what a\r\nskilled reader can find in less than five minutes. Now, librarians are\r\npresumed to be skilled readers, although it would not be quite safe to\r\napply this designation to all of that profession, since there are those\r\namong librarians, or their assistants, who are mere novices in the art of\r\nreading to advantage. Manifestly, one cannot teach what he does not know:\r\nand so the librarian who has not previously travelled the same road, will\r\nnot be able to guide the inquiring reader who asks him to point out the\r\nway. But if the way has once been found, the librarian, with only a\r\nfairly good memory, kept in constant exercise by his vocation, can find\r\nit again. Still more surely, if he has been through it many times, will\r\nhe know it intuitively, the moment any question is asked about it.\r\n\r\nIt is true of the great majority of readers resorting to a library, that\r\nthey have a most imperfect idea, both of what they want, and of the\r\nproper way to find it. The world of knowledge, they know, is vast, and\r\nthey are quite bewildered by the many paths that lead to some part or\r\nother of it, crossing each other in all directions. And among the\r\nwould-be readers may be found every shade of intelligence, and every\r\ndegree of ignorance. There is the timid variety, too modest or diffident\r\nto ask for any help at all, and so feeling about among the catalogues or\r\nother reference-books in a baffled search for information. There is the\r\nsciolist variety, who knows it all, or imagines that he does, and who\r\nasks for proof of impossible facts, with an assurance born of the\r\nprofoundest ignorance. Then, too, there is the half-informed reader, who\r\nis in search of a book he once read, but has clean forgotten, which had a\r\nremarkable description of a tornado in the West, or a storm and\r\nship-wreck at sea, or a wonderful tropical garden, or a thrilling escape\r\nfrom prison, or a descent into the bowels of the earth, or a tremendous\r\nsnow-storm, or a swarming flight of migratory birds, or a mausoleum of\r\ndeparted kings, or a haunted chamber hung with tapestry, or the fatal\r\ncaving-in of a coal-mine, or a widely destructive flood, or a\r\nhair-breadth escape from cannibals, or a race for life, pursued by\r\nwolves, or a wondrous sub-marine grotto, or a terrible forest fire, or\r\nany one of a hundred scenes or descriptions, all of which the librarian\r\nis presumed, not only to have read, but to have retained in his memory\r\nthe author, the title, and the very chapter of the book which contained\r\nit.\r\n\r\nTo give some idea of the extent and variety of information which a\r\nlibrarian is supposed to possess, I have been asked, almost at the same\r\ntime, to refer a reader to the origin of Candlemas day, to define the\r\nPragmatic Sanction, to give, out of hand, the aggregate wealth of Great\r\nBritain, compared with that of half-a-dozen other nations, to define the\r\nlimits of neutrality or belligerent rights, to explain what is meant by\r\nthe Gresham law, to tell what ship has made the quickest voyage to\r\nEurope, when she made it, and what the time was, to elucidate the meaning\r\nof the Carolina doctrine, to explain the character and objects of the\r\nKnights of the Golden Circle, to tell how large are the endowments of the\r\nBritish Universities, to give the origin of the custom of egg-rolling,\r\nto tell the meaning of the cipher dispatches, to explain who was \"Extra\r\nBilly Smith,\" to tell the aggregate number killed on all sides during the\r\nNapoleonic wars, to certify who wrote the \"Vestiges of Creation,\" or,\r\nfinally, to give the author of one of those innumerable ancient proverbs,\r\nwhich float about the world without a father.\r\n\r\nThe great number and variety of such inquiries as are propounded by\r\nreaders should not appal one. Nor should one too readily take refuge from\r\na troublesome reader by the plea, however convenient, that the library\r\ncontains nothing on that subject. While this may unquestionably be true,\r\nespecially as regards a small public library, it should never be put\r\nforward as a certainty, until one has looked. Most inquiring readers are\r\nvery patient, and being fully sensible how much they owe to the free\r\nenjoyment of the library treasures, and to the aid of the superintendent\r\nof them, they are willing to wait for information. However busy you may\r\nbe at the moment, the reader can be asked to wait, or to call at a less\r\nbusy time, when you will be prepared with a more satisfactory answer than\r\ncan be given on the spur of the moment. What cannot be done to-day, may\r\noften be done to-morrow. Remember always, that readers are entitled to\r\nthe best and most careful service, for a librarian is not only the\r\nkeeper, but the interpreter of the intellectual stores of the library. It\r\nis a good and a safe rule to let no opportunity of aiding a reader\r\nescape. One should be particularly careful to volunteer help to those who\r\nare too new or too timid to ask: and it is they who will be most grateful\r\nfor any assistance. The librarian has only to put himself in their\r\nplace--(the golden rule for a librarian, as for all the world besides),\r\nand to consider how often, in his own searches in libraries, in the\r\ncontinual, never-ending quest of knowledge, he would have been thankful\r\nfor a hint from some one who knew, or had been over the ground of his\r\nsearch before; and then he will feel the full value to the novice, of\r\nsuch knowledge as he can impart.\r\n\r\nHe is not to forget that his superior opportunities for learning all\r\nabout things, with a whole library at command, and within elbow-reach\r\nevery hour of the day, should impose upon him a higher standard of\r\nattainment than most readers are supposed to have reached. In the\r\nintervals of library work, I am accustomed to consider the looking up of\r\nsubjects or authorities as one of my very best recreations. It is as\r\ninteresting as a game of whist, and much more profitable. It is more\r\nwelcome than routine labor, for it rests or diverts the mind, by its very\r\nvariety, while, to note the different views or expressions of writers on\r\nthe same subject, affords almost endless entertainment. In tracing down a\r\nquotation also, or the half-remembered line of some verse in poetry, you\r\nencounter a host of parallel poetic images or expressions, which\r\ncontribute to aid the memory, or to feed the imagination. Or, in pursuing\r\na sought-for fact in history, through many volumes, you learn\r\ncollaterally much that may never have met your eye before. Full, as all\r\nlibraries are, of what we call trash, there is almost no book which will\r\nnot give us something,--even though it be only the negative virtue of a\r\nmodel to be avoided. One may not, indeed, always find what he seeks,\r\nbecause it may not exist at all, or it may not be found in the limited\r\nrange of his small library, but he is almost sure to find something which\r\ngives food for thought, or for memory to note. And this is one of the\r\nforemost attractions, let me add, of the librarian's calling; it is more\r\nfull of intellectual variety, of wide-open avenues to knowledge, than any\r\nother vocation whatever. His daily quests in pursuit of information to\r\nlay before others, bring him acquainted with passages that are full of\r\nendless suggestion for himself. He may not be able to pursue any of these\r\navenues at the moment; but he should make a mental or a written note of\r\nthem, for future benefit. His daily business being learning, why should\r\nhe not in time, become learned? There are, of course, among the\r\ninfinitude of questions, that come before the librarian, some that are\r\nreally insoluble problems. One of these is to be found among the topics\r\nof inquiry I just now suggested; namely: what is the aggregate wealth of\r\nGreat Britain, or that of other nations? This is a question frequently\r\nasked by inquiring Congressmen, who imagine that an answer may readily be\r\nhad from one of those gifted librarians who is invested with that\r\napocryphal attribute, commonly called omniscience. But the inquirer is\r\nsuddenly confronted by the fact (and a very stubborn fact it is) that not\r\na single foreign nation has ever taken any census of wealth whatever. In\r\nGreat Britain (about which country inquiry as to the national resources\r\nmore largely centres) the government wisely lets alone the attempt to\r\ntabulate the value of private wealth, knowing that such an object is\r\nutterly impracticable.\r\n\r\nBut, while the British census makes no attempt at estimating the property\r\nof the people, the independent estimates of statistical writers vary\r\nhopelessly and irreconcilably. Mr. J. R. McCulloch, one of the foremost\r\naccredited writers on economic science, lays it down as a dictum, that\r\n\"sixty years is the shortest time in which the capital of an old and\r\ndensely-peopled country can be expected to be doubled.\" Yet Joseph Lowe\r\nassumes the wealth of the United Kingdom to have doubled in eighteen\r\nyears, from 1823 to 1841; while George R. Porter, in his\r\nwidely-accredited book on the \"Progress of the Nation,\" and Leoni Levi, a\r\npublicist of high reputation, make out, (by combining their estimates)\r\nthat the private wealth of England increased fifty per cent. in seventeen\r\nyears, at which rate it would double in about twenty-nine years, instead\r\nof sixty, as laid down by Mr. McCulloch. Mr. Levi calculates the\r\naggregate private wealth of Great Britain in 1858, at $29,178,000,000,\r\nbeing a fraction less than the guesses of the census enumerators at the\r\nnational wealth of the United States, twelve years later, in 1870. Can\r\none guess be said to be any nearer the fact than the other? May we not be\r\npardoned for treating all estimates as utterly fallacious that are not\r\nbased upon known facts and figures? Why do we hear so much of the\r\n\"approximate correctness\" of so many statistical tables, when, in point\r\nof fact, the primary data are incapable of proof, and the averages and\r\nconclusions built upon them are all assumed? \"Statisticians,\" says one of\r\nthe fraternity, \"are generally held to be eminently practical people; on\r\nthe contrary, they are more given to theorizing than any other class of\r\nwriters; and are generally less expert in it.\"\r\n\r\nIn the presence of such gross discrepancies as these, by statisticians of\r\nthe highest repute, and among such a practical people as the English,\r\nwhat value can be attached to the mere estimates of wealth which have\r\nbeen attempted in the census of the United States? The careful\r\nSuperintendent of the Census of 1870 and 1880, the late Francis A.\r\nWalker, writes concerning it:\r\n\r\n\"At the best, these figures represent but the opinion of one man, or of a\r\nbody of men, in the collection of material, and in the calculation of the\r\nseveral elements of the public wealth.\" And in the last Census Report for\r\n1890, the results of the so-called \"census of wealth,\" are cautiously\r\nsubmitted, \"as showing in a general way a continuous increase in the\r\nwealth of the nation, the exact proportions of which cannot be\r\nmeasured.\"\r\n\r\nNow, what are we to conclude regarding the attempt to elevate to a rank\r\nin statistical science, mere estimates of private wealth, for a large\r\nportion of which, by the statements of those who make them, no actual\r\nstatistical data exist? And when this is confessedly the case in our own\r\ncountry, the only one attempting the impossible task of tabulating the\r\nwealth of the people, what shall we say of the demand that is made upon\r\nour credulity of accepting the guesses of Mr. Giffen, or Mr. Mulhall, as\r\nto British wealth? Are we not justified in applying the old Latin\r\nmaxim--\"_De non apparentibus, et de non existentibus, eadem est ratio_,\"\r\nand replying to those who demand of us to know how much any nation is\r\nworth, that it is sometimes an important part of knowledge to know that\r\nnothing can be known?\r\n\r\nAmong the literally innumerable inquiries liable to be made of a\r\nlibrarian, here is one which may give him more than a moment's pause,\r\nunless he is uncommonly well versed in American political\r\nhistory--namely, \"What was the Ostend Manifesto?\" To a mind not\r\npreviously instructed these two words \"Ostend Manifesto\", convey\r\nabsolutely no meaning. You turn to the standard encyclopaedias,\r\nAppleton's, Johnson's Universal, and the Britannica, and you find an\r\naccount of Ostend, a little Belgian city, its locality, commerce, and\r\npopulation, but absolutely nothing about an Ostend manifesto. But in J.\r\nN. Larned's \"History for Ready Reference\", a useful book in five volumes,\r\narranged in alphabetical order, you get a clue. It refers you from\r\nOstend, under letter O, to Cuba, where you learn that this formidable\r\nOstend manifesto was nothing more nor less than a paper drawn up and\r\nsigned by Messrs. Buchanan, Mason, and Slidell, Ministers of the United\r\nStates to Great Britain, France, and Spain, respectively, when at the\r\nwatering-place of Ostend, in 1854, importing that the island of Cuba\r\nought to, and under certain circumstances, must belong to the United\r\nStates. Looking a little farther, as the manifesto is not published in\r\nLarned, you find the text of the document itself in Cluskey's \"Political\r\nText-Book\", of 1860, and in some of the American newspapers of 1854. This\r\nis a case of pursuing a once notorious, but more recently obscure topic,\r\nthrough many works of reference until found.\r\n\r\nIn many searches for names of persons, it becomes highly important to\r\nknow before-hand where to look, and equally important where not to look,\r\nfor certain biographies. Thus, if you seek for the name of any living\r\ncharacter, it is necessary to know that it would be useless to look in\r\nthe Encyclopædia Britannica, because the rule of compilation of that work\r\npurposely confined its sketches of notable persons to those who were\r\nalready deceased when its volumes appeared. So you save the time of\r\nhunting in at least one conspicuous work of reference, before you begin,\r\nby simply knowing its plan.\r\n\r\nIn like manner, you should know that it is useless to search for two\r\nclasses of names in the \"Dictionary of National Biography,\" the most\r\ncopious biographical dictionary of British personages ever published,\r\nbegun in 1885, under Leslie Stephen, and reaching its sixty-first volume,\r\nand letter W in 1899, under the editorship of Sidney Lee. These two\r\nclasses of names are first, all persons not British, that is, not either\r\nEnglish, Scottish or Irish; and secondly, names of British persons now\r\nliving. This is because this great work, like the Britannica, purposely\r\nconfines itself to the names of notables deceased; and, unlike the\r\nBritannica, it further limits its biographies to persons connected by\r\nbirth or long residence with the British kingdom. Knowing this fact\r\nbefore-hand, will save any time wasted in searching the Dictionary of\r\nNational Biography for any persons now living, or for any American or\r\nEuropean names.\r\n\r\nAnother caveat may properly be interposed as regards searches for\r\ninformation in that most widely advertised and circulated of all works of\r\nreference,--the Encyclopaedia Britannica. The plan of that work was to\r\nfurnish the reading public with the very best treatises upon leading\r\ntopics in science, history, and literature, by eminent scholars and\r\nspecialists in various fields. Pursuant to this general scheme, each\r\ngreat subject has a most elaborate, and sometimes almost exhaustive\r\narticle--as, for example, chemistry, geology, etc., while the minor\r\ndivisions of each topic do not appear in the alphabet at all, or appear\r\nonly by cross-reference to the generic name under which they are treated.\r\nIt results, that while you find, for example, a most extensive article\r\nupon \"Anatomy\", filling a large part of a volume of the Britannica, you\r\nlook in vain in the alphabet for such subjects as \"blood, brain,\r\ncartilage, sinew, tissue,\" etc., which are described only in the article\r\n\"Anatomy.\" This method has to be well comprehended in order for any\r\nreader to make use of this great Cyclopaedia understandingly. Even by the\r\naid of the English index to the work, issued by its foreign publishers,\r\nthe reader who is in hasty quest of information in the Britannica, will\r\nmost frequently be baffled by not finding any minor subject in the index.\r\nThe English nation, judged by most of the productions of its literary and\r\nscientific men in that field, has small genius for indexing. It was\r\nreserved to an American to prepare and print a thorough index, at once\r\nalphabetical and analytical, to this great English thesaurus of\r\ninformation--an index ten times more copious, and therefore more useful\r\nto the student, than the meagre one issued in England. This index fills\r\n3,900 closely printed columns, forming the whole of volume 25 of the\r\nPhiladelphia edition of the work. By its aid, every name and every topic,\r\ntreated anywhere in this vast repository of human knowledge can be traced\r\nout and appropriated; while without it, the Encyclopaedia Britannica,\r\nwith all its great merits, must remain very much in the nature of a\r\nsealed book to the reader who stands in need of immediate use and\r\nreference. We have to take it for what it is--a collection of masterly\r\ntreatises, rather than a handy dictionary of knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe usefulness and success of any library will depend very largely upon\r\nthe sympathy, so to speak, between the readers and the librarian. When\r\nthis is well established, the rest is very easy. The librarian should not\r\nseclude himself so as to be practically inaccessible to readers, nor\r\ntrust wholly to assistants to answer their inquiries. This may be\r\nnecessary in some large libraries, where great and diversified interests\r\nconnected with the building up of the collection, the catalogue system,\r\nand the library management and administration are all concerned. In the\r\nBritish Museum Library, no one ever sees the Principal Librarian; even\r\nthe next officer, who is called the keeper of the printed books, is not\r\nusually visible in the reading-room at all.\r\n\r\nA librarian who is really desirous of doing the greatest good to the\r\ngreatest number of people, will be not only willing, but anxious to\r\nanswer inquiries, even though they may appear to him trivial and\r\nunimportant. Still, he should also economise time by cultivating the\r\nhabit of putting his answers into the fewest and plainest words.\r\n\r\nHow far the librarian should place himself in direct communication with\r\nreaders, must depend largely upon the extent of the library, the labor\r\nrequired in managing its various departments, the amount and value of\r\nassistance at his command, and upon various other circumstances,\r\ndepending upon the different conditions with different librarians. But it\r\nmay be laid down as a safe general rule, that the librarian should hold\r\nhimself perpetually as a public servant, ready and anxious to answer in\r\nsome way, all inquiries that may come to him. Thus, and thus only, can he\r\nmake himself, and the collection of books under his charge, useful in the\r\nhighest degree to the public. He will not indeed, in any extensive\r\nlibrary, find it convenient, or even possible, to answer all inquiries in\r\nperson; but he should always be ready to enable his assistants to answer\r\nthem, by his superior knowledge as to the best sources of information,\r\nwhenever they fail to trace out what is wanted. In any small library, he\r\nshould be always accessible, at or near the place where people are\r\naccustomed to have their wants for books or information supplied: and the\r\npublic resorting to the library will thus come not only to rely upon him\r\nfor aid in their intellectual researches, but to appreciate and respect\r\nhim for the wide extent of his knowledge, and to consider him, in time,\r\nan indispensable guide, if not leader, in the community. His reputation,\r\nin fact, will depend upon the extent to which he has been able to help\r\nothers, as well as upon the number of people whom he has thus aided.\r\n\r\nIn a very high sense, the true librarian is an educator; his school is as\r\nlarge as the town in which his library is situated. Very few people in\r\nthat town know what he is always presumed to know,--namely--to what books\r\nto go to get answers to the questions they want answered. In supplying\r\ncontinually the means of answering these countless questions, the library\r\nbecomes actually a popular university, in which the librarian is the\r\nprofessor, the tuition is free, and the course is optional, both as to\r\nstudy and as to time.\r\n\r\nMost persons who come to make any investigation in a public library\r\nrequire a good deal of assistance. For example, a reader is in need of\r\nthe latest information as to the amount of steel and iron made in this\r\ncountry, and what State produces these important manufactures. He has not\r\nthe faintest idea where to look for the information, except that it may\r\nbe in the census, but the census is nine years old, and he wants recent\r\nfacts. It is vain to turn him over to the cyclopaedias, for there is not\r\none whose information upon such statistics comes anywhere near up to\r\ndate. You have to put before him a pamphlet annual, published by the\r\nAmerican Iron and Steel Association, which contains exactly what he\r\nwants; and no other source of information does contain it.\r\n\r\nAnother inquirer seeks to know how to treat some disease. In such cases,\r\nof course, the librarian should not go farther than to put before the\r\nreader a work on domestic medicine, for it is not his function to deal in\r\nrecommendations of this, that, or the other method of treatment, any more\r\nthan it is to give legal opinions, if asked--although he may have studied\r\nlaw. So, if the reader wants to know about the religious tenets of the\r\nPresbyterians, or the Mormons, or the Buddhists, or the doctrines of the\r\nCatholic Church, and asks the librarian's opinion about any controverted\r\nquestion of belief, he is to be answered only by the statement that the\r\nlibrary is there to supply information, not opinions, and then pointed to\r\nthe religious cyclopaedias, which give full summaries of all the sects.\r\n\r\nHe may frequently be asked for information on a subject which he knows\r\nnothing about; and I have heard a librarian declare, that he often found\r\nhimself able to give fuller and better information on a subject of which\r\nhe was previously ignorant, than upon one he had long been familiar with.\r\nThe reason was that in the one case he had freshly looked up all the\r\nauthorities, and put them before the reader, while in the other, giving\r\nthe references from a memory, more or less imperfect, he had overlooked\r\nsome of the most important means of information.\r\n\r\nThe constant exercise of the habit of supplying helps to readers is a\r\nsplendid intellectual school for the librarian himself. Through it, his\r\nmemory is quickened and consequently improved, (as every faculty is by\r\nuse) his habits of mental classification and analysis are formed or\r\nstrengthened, and his mind is kept on the alert to utilize the whole\r\narsenal of the knowledge he has already acquired, or to acquire new\r\nknowledge.\r\n\r\nAnother very important benefit derived by the librarian from his\r\nconstantly recurring attention to the calls of readers for aid, is the\r\nsuggestion thereby furnished of the deficiencies in the collection in his\r\ncharge. This will be a continual reminder to him, of what he most needs,\r\nnamely, how to equip the library with the best and most recent sources of\r\ninformation in every field of inquiry. Whether the library be a large or\r\na small one, its deficiencies in some directions are sure to be very\r\nconsiderable: and these gaps are more conspicuously revealed in trying to\r\nsupply readers with the means of making what may be termed an exhaustive\r\nresearch upon a given subject, than in any other way. You find, for\r\nexample, in looking up your authorities in what has come to be called\r\nEgyptology, that while you have Wilkinson's Ancient Egypt, and Lane's\r\nModern Egyptians, both of which are very valuable works, you have not the\r\nmore modern books of Brugsch-Bey, or of A. H. Sayce, or of Maspero. You\r\nmay also find out, by mingling freely with a good part of the readers,\r\nwhat subjects are most frequently looked into or inquired about, and you\r\ncan thus secure valuable information as to the directions in which the\r\nlibrary most needs strengthening. Thus, in a community largely made up of\r\npeople connected with manufacturing interests, the inquiries are liable\r\nto be much concerned with the mechanic arts; and you would therefore\r\nnaturally seek to acquire a liberal selection of the best and latest\r\nworks in technical science, or the useful arts. If you have, on the other\r\nhand, very few inquiries, indeed, for theological works, you take it as\r\nsome evidence that that department of the collection needs little\r\nenlargement, and you may devote your funds in other directions. Then too,\r\nthe great value of popularising the library by the hearty interest shown\r\nby the librarian in the wants of the people can hardly be over-rated.\r\nThis interest, being a perennial one, and continued through a series of\r\nyears, the number of citizens and their families assisted will be\r\nconstantly on the increase, and the public opinion of the town will come\r\nin time, to regard the library as a great popular necessity. Hence, if it\r\nis an institution supported in whole or in part by town or municipal\r\nfunds, its claims to liberal consideration will be immeasurably\r\nstrengthened. If an enlargement of room for the books, or even a new\r\nlibrary building comes to be needed, its chances for securing the funds\r\nrequisite will be excellent. If a more liberal supply of new books, or an\r\nextended range of older ones of great value is reported by the librarian\r\nas wanted to increase the usefulness of the library, the authorities will\r\nmore cheerfully consider the claim. And if it is proposed that additional\r\nand competent assistance shall be given to the librarian, or that he\r\nshould be more liberally compensated for his highly useful and important\r\nlabors, that, too, may be accomplished--especially if it has come to be\r\nrecognized that by his wide knowledge, and skilful management, and\r\nhelpful devotion to the service of the reading public, he has rendered\r\nhimself indispensable.\r\n\r\nIn the supply of information desired by readers, it is better to leave\r\nthem to their own search, once you have put before them the proper\r\nauthorities, than to spend your time in turning for them to the volume\r\nand page. This, for two reasons--first, it leaves your own time free to\r\nhelp other readers, or to attend to the ever-waiting library work; and,\r\nsecondly, it induces habits of research and self-help on the part of the\r\nreader. It is enough for the librarian to act as an intelligent\r\nguide-post, to point the way; to travel the road is the business of the\r\nreader himself. Therefore, let the visitor in quest of a quotation, look\r\nit out in the index of the volumes you put before him. If he fails to\r\nfind it, it will then be time for you to intervene, and lend the aid of\r\nyour more practiced eye, and superior knowledge of how to search; or\r\nelse, let the reader look for it in some more copious anthology, which\r\nyou may put before him. There are multitudes of inquiries for the authors\r\nof poems, which are in no sense \"familiar quotations,\" nor even select\r\nquotations, but which are merely common-place sentiments expressed in\r\nlanguage quite unpoetic,--and not the work of any notable writer at all.\r\nThey are either the production of some utterly obscure author of a volume\r\nof verse, quite unknown to fame, or, still more probably, the\r\nhalf-remembered verses of some anonymous contributor to the poet's corner\r\nof the newspaper or magazine. In such cases, where you see no poetic\r\nbeauty or imaginative power in the lines, it is well to inform the\r\ninquirer at once that you do not think them the production of any noted\r\nwriter, and thus end the fruitless search for memorizing what is not at\r\nall memorable. What may strike uncultivated readers as beautiful, may be\r\nset down as trash, by a mind that has been fed upon the masterpieces of\r\npoetry. Not that the librarian is to assume the air of an oracle or a\r\ncensor, (something to be in all circumstances avoided) or to pronounce\r\npositive judgment upon what is submitted: he should inform any admiring\r\nreader of a passage not referred to in any of the anthologies, and not\r\npossessing apparent poetic merit, that he believes the author is unknown\r\nto fame. That should be sufficient for any reasonably disposed reader,\r\nwho, after search duly completed, will go away answered, if not\r\nsatisfied.\r\n\r\nI gave some instances of the singular variety of questions asked of a\r\nlibrarian. Let me add one, reported by Mr. Robert Harrison, of the London\r\nLibrary, as asked of him by William M. Thackeray. The distinguished\r\nauthor of Esmond and The Virginians wanted a book that would tell of\r\nGeneral Wolfe, the hero of Quebec. \"I don't want to know about his\r\nbattles\", said the novelist. \"I can get all that from the histories. I\r\nwant something that will tell me the color of the breeches he wore.\"\r\nAfter due search, the librarian was obliged to confess that there was no\r\nsuch book.\r\n\r\nA librarian is likely to be constantly in a position to aid the\r\nuninformed reader how to use the books of reference which every public\r\nlibrary contains. The young person who is new to the habit of\r\ninvestigation, or the adult who has never learned the method of finding\r\nthings, needs to be shown how to use even so simple a thing as an index.\r\nDo not be impatient with his ignorance, although you may find him\r\nfumbling over the pages in the body of the book in vain, to find what\r\nyou, with your acquired knowledge of indexes and their use, can find in\r\nhalf a minute or less. Practice alone can make one perfect in the art of\r\nsearch and speedy finding. The tyro who tries your patience this year,\r\nwill very likely become an expert reader the next. Wide as is the domain\r\nof ignorance, there are few among those intelligent enough to resort to a\r\nlibrary at all, who cannot learn. You will find some who come to the\r\nlibrary so unskilled, that they will turn over the leaves even of an\r\nindex, in a blind, hap-hazard way, evidently at a loss how to use it.\r\nThese must be instructed first, that the index is arranged just like a\r\ndictionary, in the alphabetical order of the names or subjects treated,\r\nand secondly, that after finding the word they seek in it, they must turn\r\nto the page indicated by the figure attached to that word. This is the\r\nvery primer of learning in the use of a library, but the library in any\r\ntown, used as it is by many boys and girls of all ages, has to be a\r\nprimary school for beginners, as well as a university for advanced\r\nstudents. Despise not the day of small things, however you may find it\r\nmore agreeable to be occupied with great ones.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, you will find at the other extreme of intelligence,\r\namong your clientage of readers, those who are completely familiar with\r\nbooks and their uses. There are some readers frequenting public\r\nlibraries, who not only do not need assistance themselves, but who are\r\nfully competent to instruct the librarian. In meeting the calls of such\r\nskilled readers, who always know what they require, it is never good\r\npolicy to obtrude advice or suggestion, but simply to supply what they\r\ncall for. You will readily recognize and discriminate such experts from\r\nthe mass of readers, if you have good discernment. Sometimes they are\r\nquite as sensitive as they are intelligent, and it may annoy them to have\r\noffered them books they do not want, in the absence of what they require.\r\nAn officious, or super-serviceable librarian or assistant, may sometimes\r\nprejudice such a reader by proffering help which he does not want,\r\ninstead of waiting for his own call or occasion.\r\n\r\nLet us look at a few examples of the numerous calls at a popular library.\r\nFor example, a reader asks to see a book, giving an account of the\r\nmarriage of the Adriatic. You know that this concerns the history of\r\nVenice and its Doges, and you turn to various books on Venice, and its\r\nhistory, until you find a description of the strange festival. It may be,\r\nand probably is the case, that the books, like most descriptive works and\r\nnarratives of travellers, are without index. This is a disability in the\r\nuse of books which you must continually encounter, since multitudes of\r\nvolumes, old and new, are sent out without a vestige of an index to their\r\ncontents. Some writers have urged that a law should be made refusing\r\ncopyright to the author of any book who failed to provide it with an\r\nindex; a requirement highly desirable, but also highly impracticable. Yet\r\nyou will find in most books, a division of the contents into chapters,\r\nand in the beginning of the volume a table of the contents of each\r\nchapter, giving its leading topics. This is a substitute for an index,\r\nalthough (not being arranged in alphabetical order) it is far less useful\r\nthan that time-saving aid to research. But you have to learn to take\r\nadvantage of even poor and inferior helps, when you cannot have the best,\r\n(as a poor guide is better than no guide at all, unless it misguides,)\r\nand so you run your eye quickly through the table of contents to find\r\nwhat you seek. In the case supposed, of the ceremony at Venice, you will\r\nbe aided in the search by having in mind that the catch-words involved\r\nare \"Adriatic,\" and \"Doge,\" and as these begin with capital letters,\r\nwhich stand out, as it were, from the monotonous \"lower case\" type (as\r\nprinters call all the letters that are not capitals) your search will be\r\nmuch abridged by omitting to read through all the sentences of your table\r\nof contents, and seizing only the passage or passages where \"Doge,\" or\r\n\"Adriatic,\" may occur.\r\n\r\nThis remark will apply as well to numerous other searches which you will\r\nhave to make in books. The table of contents will commonly take note of\r\nall the more salient topics that are treated in the book, whether of\r\npersons, of places, of notable scenes, historic events, etc., and so\r\nwill aid you in finding what you seek. In the last resort only, in the\r\nbooks whose table of contents fails you, will you have to turn the leaves\r\npage by page, which, while not equivalent to reading the book through, is\r\na time-consuming business.\r\n\r\nOf course no librarian can devote hours of his precious time to searches\r\nin such detail for readers. They are to be supplied with the books likely\r\nto contain what they are in search of, and left to seek it in their own\r\nway, with such hints and cautions as to saving time by taking the\r\nshortest road, as the experience of the librarian enables him to supply.\r\nThe suggestions here given are not needed by scholarly readers, but are\r\nthe fruits of long experience in searching books for what they contain.\r\n\r\nAgain, let us take the case of a call by a reader who happens to be a\r\ndecorative painter, for patterns which may furnish him hints in finishing\r\nan interior of a house. Of course he wants color--that is, not theory\r\nonly, but illustration, or practical examples. So you put before him Owen\r\nJones's Grammar of Ornament, or Racinet's _L'Ornement polychrome_, both\r\nillustrated with many beautiful designs in color, which he is delighted\r\nto find.\r\n\r\nAnother reader is anxious to see a picture of \"St. George and the\r\nDragon.\" If you have the \"Museum of Painting and Sculpture,\" in 17\r\nvolumes, or Champlin's \"Cyclopaedia of Painters and Painting,\" a\r\ndictionary of art in four volumes, you find it in either work, in the\r\nalphabet, under \"St. George,\" and his want is satisfied.\r\n\r\nA youngster wants to know how to build a boat, and you find him Folkard\r\non Boats, or Frazar's Sail-boats, which describe and figure various\r\nstyles of water-craft.\r\n\r\nPerhaps an inquisitive reader wants to find out all about the families of\r\nthe various languages, and what is known of their origin, and you supply\r\nhim with W. D. Whitney's \"Life and Growth of Language,\" or Max Müller's\r\n\"Science of Language,\" either of which furnishes full information.\r\n\r\nAnother inquirer seeks for information about the aggregate debts of\r\nnations. You give him the great quarto volume of the last Census on\r\nWealth and Indebtedness, or for still later information the Statesman's\r\nYear Book for 1899, or the Almanach de Gotha for the current year, both\r\nof which contain the comparative debts of nations at the latest dates.\r\n\r\nThe inquirer who seeks to know the rates of wages paid for all kinds of\r\nlabor in a series of several years, can be supplied with the elaborate\r\nReport on Labor and Wages for fifty-two years, published by the U. S.\r\nGovernment in 1893, in four volumes.\r\n\r\nAnother reader wishes, we will suppose, to hunt up the drawings of all\r\npatents that have been issued on type-writers, and type-writing\r\ninventions. You put before him the many indexes to the Patent\r\nSpecifications and Patent Office Gazette; he makes out from these his\r\nlist of volumes wanted, which are at once supplied, and he falls to work\r\non his long, but to him interesting job.\r\n\r\nA reader who has seen in the library or elsewhere a book he would much\r\nlike to own, but cannot find a copy in town, wants to know what it will\r\ncost: you turn to your American or foreign catalogue, covering the year\r\nof publication, and give him not only the price, but the publisher's name\r\nfrom whom he can order it, and he goes on his way rejoicing.\r\n\r\nAn artist engaged upon a painting in which he wishes to introduce a deer,\r\nor a group of rabbits, or an American eagle, or a peacock, asks for an\r\naccurate picture of the bird or animal wanted. You put before him J. S.\r\nKingsley's Riverside Natural History, in six volumes, and his desire is\r\nsatisfied.\r\n\r\nIn dealing with books of reference, there will often be found very\r\nimportant discrepancies of statement, different works giving different\r\ndates, for example, for the same event in history or biography.\r\n\r\nNext to a bible and a dictionary of language, there is no book, perhaps,\r\nmore common than a biographical dictionary. Our interest in our\r\nfellow-men is perennial; and we seek to know not only their\r\ncharacteristics, and the distinguishing events of their lives, but also\r\nthe time of their birth into the world and their exit from it. This is a\r\nspecies of statistics upon which one naturally expects certainty, since\r\nno person eminent enough to be recorded at all is likely to have the\r\nepoch of his death, at least, unremarked. Yet the seeker after exact\r\ninformation in the biographical dictionaries will find, if he extends his\r\nquest among various authorities, that he is afloat on a sea of\r\nuncertainties. Not only can he not find out the date of decease of some\r\nfamous navigators, like Sir John Franklin and La Perouse, who sailed into\r\nunexplored regions of the globe, and were never heard of more, but the\r\nmen who died at home, in the midst of friends and families, are\r\nfrequently recorded as deceased at dates so discrepant that no ingenuity\r\ncan reconcile them.\r\n\r\nIn Haydn's Dictionary of Dates, Sir Henry Havelock was said to have died\r\nNovember 25th, 1857, while Maunder's Treasury of Biography gives November\r\n21st, the London Almanac, November 27th, and the Life of Havelock, by his\r\nbrother-in-law, November 24th. Here are four distinct dates of death\r\ngiven, by authorities apparently equally accredited, to a celebrated\r\ngeneral, who died within forty years of our own time. Of the death of the\r\nnotorious Robespierre, guillotined in 1794, we find in Chalmers'\r\nBiographical Dictionary that he died July 10th, in Rees's Cyclopaedia,\r\nJuly 28th, and in Alison's History of Europe, July 29th. Doubtless it is\r\nsome comfort to reflect, in view of his many crimes, that the bloody\r\ntyrant of the Jacobins is really dead, irrespective of the date, about\r\nwhich biographers may dispute. Of the English mechanician Joseph Bramah,\r\ninventor of the Bramah lock, we learn from the English Cyclopaedia, that\r\nhe died in 1814, and from Rose's Biographical Dictionary, that he died in\r\n1815.\r\n\r\nNow, although a large share of the errors and discrepancies that abound\r\nin biographical dictionaries and other books of reference may be\r\naccounted for by misprints, others by reckoning old style instead of new,\r\nand many more by carelessness of writers and transcribers, it is plain\r\nthat all the variations cannot be thus accounted for. Nothing is more\r\ncommon in printing offices than to find a figure 6 inverted serving as a\r\n9, a 5 for a 3, or a 3 for an 8, while 8, 9, and O, are frequently\r\ninterchanged. In such cases, a keen-eyed proof-reader may not always be\r\npresent to prevent the falsification of history; and it is a fact, not\r\nsufficiently recognized, that to the untiring vigilance, intelligence,\r\nand hard, conscientious labors of proof-readers, the world owes a deeper\r\ndebt of gratitude than it does to many a famous maker of books. It is\r\neasy enough to make books, Heaven knows, but to make them correct, \"_Hic\r\nlabor, hoc opus est_.\"\r\n\r\nA high authority in encyclopaedical lore tells us that the best\r\naccredited authorities are at odds with regard to the birth or death of\r\nindividuals in the enormous ratio of from twenty to twenty-five per cent.\r\nof the whole number in the biographical dictionaries. The Portuguese poet\r\nCamoens is said by some authorities to have been born in 1517, and by\r\nothers in 1525; a discrepancy of eight years. Chateaubriand is declared\r\nby the English Cyclopaedia to have been born September 4th, 1768;\r\nSeptember 14th, 1768, by the Nouvelle Biographie générale of Dr. Hoefer;\r\nand September 4th, 1769, by the Conversations-Lexicon. Of course it is\r\nclear that all these authorities cannot be right; but which of the three\r\nis so, is matter of extreme doubt, leaving the student of facts perplexed\r\nand uncertain at the very point where certainty is not only most\r\nimportant, but most confidently expected.\r\n\r\nOf another kind are the errors that sometimes creep into works of\r\nreference of high credit, by accepting too confidently statements\r\npublicly made. In one edition of the Dictionary of Congress a certain\r\nhonorable member from Pennsylvania, in uncommonly robust health, was\r\nastonished to find himself recorded as having died of the National Hotel\r\ndisease, contracted at Washington in 1856. In this case, the editor of\r\nthe work was a victim of too much confidence in the newspapers. In the\r\nCongressional Directory, where brief biographies of Congressmen are\r\ngiven, one distinguished member was printed as having been elected to\r\nCongress at a time which, taken in connection with his birth-date in the\r\nsame paragraph, made him precisely one year old when he took his seat in\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nEven in reporting the contents of public and private libraries,\r\nexaggeration holds sway. The library of George the Fourth, inherited by\r\nthat graceless ignoramus from a book-collecting father, and presented to\r\nthe British nation with ostentatious liberality only after he had failed\r\nto sell it to Russia, was said in the publications of those times to\r\ncontain about 120,000 volumes. But an actual enumeration when the books\r\nwere lodged in the King's library at the British Museum, where they have\r\never since remained, showed that there were only 65,250 volumes, being\r\nbut little more than half the reported number. Many libraries, public\r\nand private, are equally over-estimated. It is so much easier to guess\r\nthan to count, and the stern test of arithmetic is too seldom applied,\r\nnotwithstanding the fact that 100,000 volumes can easily be counted in a\r\nday by a single person, and so on in the same proportion. Here, as in the\r\nstatistics of population, the same proverb holds good, that the unknown\r\nis always the magnificent, and on the surface of the globe we inhabit,\r\nthe unexplored country is always the most marvellous, since the world\r\nbegan.\r\n\r\nThese discrepancies in authorities, and exaggerations of writers, are not\r\nreferred to for the purpose of casting doubt upon all published history,\r\nbut only to point out that we cannot trust implicitly to what we find in\r\nbooks. Bearing in mind always, that accuracy is perhaps the rarest of\r\nhuman qualities, we should hold our judgment in reserve upon controverted\r\nstatements, trusting no writer implicitly, unless sustained by original\r\nauthorities. When asked to recommend the best book upon any subject, do\r\nnot too confidently assert the merits of the one you may think the best,\r\nbut say simply that it is well accredited, or very popular. It is not\r\nalways safe to recommend books, and the librarian does well to speak with\r\nproper reservations as to most of them, and to recommend only what are\r\nwell known to him to be good, by his own intimate acquaintance with them,\r\nor, which is the surest test of all, by the verdicts of critical reviews,\r\nor by the constant reprinting of them in many successive years.\r\n\r\nIt was the well-nigh unanimous report at a Conference of American\r\nlibrarians, upon the subject of \"aids to readers\", that \"nothing can take\r\nthe place of an intelligent and obliging assistant at the desk.\" This was\r\nafter a thorough canvass of the relative merits of the various reference\r\nbooks and helps to readers in book form. Not only the casual reader, and\r\nthe reader with a purpose may be constantly aided by the librarian's\r\nknowledge, and larger experience in the art of finding things, but\r\nteachers in the schools, clergymen preparing discourses, and every one\r\nseeking to know anything, should find the librarian a living catalogue.\r\nThere is nothing so effective in the world as individual effort.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 11.\r\n\r\nACCESS TO LIBRARY SHELVES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe matter of free or unrestricted access to the books on the shelves is\r\na vexed question in libraries. Open and unprotected shelves, either in\r\nalcoves or the main reading room, while they appear to be a boon to\r\nreaders, who can thus browse at will through the literary pastures, and\r\nturn over volumes at their pleasure, furnish by no means good security\r\nfor the books. Some of the smaller public libraries protect their books\r\nfrom access by glass doors in front of the shelves, which form also a\r\npartial protection against dust. Others again, use wire screen doors,\r\nopened, like the others, by lock and key when books are wanted. Both of\r\nthese arrangements give to readers the advantage of reading the titles on\r\nthe backs of most of the books in the library, while protecting them from\r\nbeing handled, disarranged, or removed. But they are also open to the\r\nobjection that they obstruct the prompt service of the books, by just the\r\namount of time it takes to open the doors or screens, and close them\r\nagain. This trouble and delay may overbalance the supposed advantages.\r\nCertainly they must do so in all large libraries, where the frequentation\r\nis great, and where every moment's delay in the book service works\r\ndisadvantage to numerous readers. While private libraries, or quite small\r\npublic ones, can indulge in the luxury of glass cases, no extensive\r\ncollection can be managed with the requisite promptitude under their\r\nobstructions.\r\n\r\nBut how to avoid the indiscriminate and usually careless handling of the\r\nbooks on shelves, by the people frequenting the library, and still\r\nextend to readers prompt and full service of all the books they wish to\r\nconsult on any subject, is a problem. In a few of the great libraries,\r\nwhere that modern improvement, the stack system, prevails, the difficulty\r\nis solved by the storing of the books in the outside repositories, or\r\niron book-stacks to which readers are not admitted. In this case the\r\nreading room is only for books in use by those frequenting it, or is\r\nsupplied with a selection of reference books simply, the stacks being\r\ndrawn upon for all the rest. This of course secures the books both from\r\nmisplacement and from pillage.\r\n\r\nIn smaller libraries which have no stack system (and this includes by far\r\nthe greater number) a variety of treatment prevails. Most of them are\r\nunprovided with any effective means of guarding the books on the shelves\r\nfrom handling. The result is great insecurity, and inevitable\r\nmisplacement of books, amounting often to confusion and chaos on the\r\nshelves, unless corrected by much daily re-arrangement by the librarian\r\nor assistants. This consumes much valuable time, which ought to be\r\ndevoted to other pressing duties.\r\n\r\nOne remedy is to guard the shelves by a railing of some kind, which\r\ncannot be passed, except at the gates or passage-ways provided for the\r\nattendants. This simple provision will protect the orderly arrangement as\r\nwell as the safety of the library--two objects both of cardinal\r\nimportance. Absolutely free access to all the shelves means, sooner or\r\nlater, loss to the library. And the books most certain to be taken or\r\nmutilated are those which it is costly, or difficult, or in some cases,\r\nimpossible to replace. The chances of abstracting engravings from books\r\nare much greater in the shadow of the shelves, than in the open\r\nreading-room, under the eyes of many. In any library but the smaller\r\nones, the difficulties and dangers of unrestricted handling of all the\r\nbooks by the public will be developed in the direct ratio of the size of\r\nthe library. Nor will it do to admit one class of readers to the shelves,\r\nand exclude others. It often happens that persons claiming to have\r\nspecial literary or scientific objects, and who profess that they cannot\r\nget along at all by having books brought to them, are favored in their\r\nwish to go to the shelves, while others are disfavored. This raises at\r\nonce the just complaint that invidious distinctions are made. The only\r\nsafe rule to follow is that of universal free access, or impartial and\r\nuniform exclusion from the shelves. In the latter case, no one can\r\ncomplain, especially when made aware that he can have all the works on a\r\ngiven subject brought to his seat in a brief time, and can work upon them\r\nto much greater comfort and advantage, seated where there is good light\r\nand ample room, than if standing up in the shadow of the shelves to\r\npursue his researches.\r\n\r\nIt is also to be considered that such disarrangement of books as\r\ninevitably follows free admission to the shelves deprives the very\r\npersons who claim this privilege, of finding what they seek, until a\r\ncomplete replacement takes place, throughout the library, and this is\r\nnecessarily a work of time. That it involves much more time and\r\nconsequent delay than is occasioned by the re-shelving of books used in a\r\nday, is apparent when we consider that in the latter case, only the\r\nnumber of volumes actually withdrawn from shelves by the library\r\nattendants have to be replaced, and that these are in conveniently\r\nassorted piles all ready to go to their respective shelves; while in the\r\nother case, the displacement is made by many hands, most of them careless\r\nof any convenience but their own, and moreover, the disarranged books\r\nare, or are liable to be, scattered on the wrong shelves, thus throwing\r\nthe entire library into disorder, requiring great pains, knowledge, and\r\ntime to repair.\r\n\r\nIn any well-regulated library, the absence of any book from its place can\r\nalmost always be accounted for. Thus it is either--1. In the reading\r\nroom, in use; or 2. Charged out to a borrower; or 3. Sent to the binder\r\nfor rebinding, or repair; or 4. Reserved for some reader's use; or 5. In\r\ntemporary use by a cataloguer, or some other library assistant; or 6.\r\nAmong the books not yet re-shelved from recent use.\r\n\r\nNow each of these is a legitimate reason for the absence of any book not\r\nfound in its place. By search under each of these heads, _seriatim_,\r\naided by the memory of librarian and assistants, the missing volume\r\nshould be readily located, and soon availed of for use.\r\n\r\nBut in the case of books misplaced by readers, no such tracing out of the\r\nwhereabouts of any volume is effectual, for the reason that the book may\r\nhave been (and probably is) put on some shelf where it does not belong.\r\nAnd the question, where in an extensive collection, a book-hunter\r\nadmitted to freely range over all the shelves, and a stranger to the\r\nminute classification of books, has misplaced the missing volumes, is an\r\ninsoluble problem, except by hunting over or handling the entire library.\r\n\r\nIn this close practical view of the case we have to add to the long list\r\nof the enemies of books, formerly enumerated, those who demand a right to\r\nbrowse (as they term it) among the shelves of a public library, and who\r\ndisplace the books they take down to gratify, it may be, only an idle\r\ncuriosity. Their offence consists, not in being anxious to see the books,\r\nbut in preventing others from seeing them, by segregating them where\r\nneither librarian nor assistants may be able to find them, when called\r\nfor. The whole question is summed up in the statement that the ability\r\nto produce library books when called for, depends strictly upon keeping\r\nthem in their proper place: and this is quite incompatible with\r\npromiscuous handling upon the shelves.\r\n\r\nThe preservation of order is alike in the interest of the reading public,\r\nof the librarian and his assistants, and of the very persons who complain\r\nof it as depriving them of library facilities. If library facilities\r\nconsist in rendering the books in it unfindable, and therefore\r\nunavailable to any reader, then the argument for free range of the\r\nshelves arrives at a _reductio ad absurdum_. The true library facilities\r\nconsist in a classification and a catalogue which arrange the books in\r\nsystematic order, and keep them there, save when called into use. Thus,\r\nand thus only, can those who resort to a public library for actual\r\nresearch, be assured of finding what they want, just when they want it.\r\nThe time saved to all readers by the sure and steady preservation of an\r\norderly arrangement of the books, is simply incalculable. Multiply the\r\nnumber of volumes out of place by the number of readers who call for\r\nthem, and you have some idea of the mischief that may be done through the\r\ncarelessness of a few favored readers, to the whole community of\r\nscholars. Of course the considerations here set forth pre-suppose an\r\nactive and intelligent librarian, and zealous and willing attendants, all\r\never ready to aid the researches of readers by the most prompt and\r\nhelpful suggestions, and by dispatch in placing before them what they\r\nmost need. The one cardinal design of a library--to supply the largest\r\namount of information in the shortest time, is subverted by any\r\ndisorganizing scheme. If the library be administered on the just\r\nprinciple of \"the greatest good to the greatest number,\" then such\r\nindividual favoritism should never be allowed.\r\n\r\nIt may, indeed, be claimed that there is no rule without some valid\r\nexceptions; but these exceptions should never be permitted to defeat the\r\ncardinal object of the rule--which is to keep every book strictly in its\r\nown place. Let the exception be confined to allowing an occasional\r\ninspection of the shelves in the company of a library attendant, and\r\nthere will be no trouble.\r\n\r\nBut there is another danger, aside from the misplacement of books.\r\nExperience has shown that thefts or mutilations of books have been\r\nnumerous, in direct proportion to the extension of freedom and\r\nopportunity to those frequenting the library. Literary men and\r\nbook-lovers are frequently book-collectors also; and the temptation to\r\ntake what is often too loosely considered public property is sometimes\r\nyielded to by persons whose character and standing may render them the\r\nleast suspected. In one of the largest lending libraries in this country,\r\nthe purloining of books had been carried so far, that the authorities had\r\nto provide a wire fence all around the reading room, to keep the readers\r\nfrom access to the shelves. The result was soon seen in the reduction of\r\nthe number of books stolen from 700 volumes to 300 volumes a year.\r\n\r\nAfter several years' experience of the Astor Library in opening its\r\nalcoves to readers (amounting to practical free admission to the shelves\r\nto all calling themselves special students) the losses and mutilations of\r\nbooks became so serious, that alcove admissions have been greatly\r\ncurtailed.\r\n\r\nAt the Conference of Librarians in London, in 1877, the subject of\r\nadmission or non-admission to the shelves was discussed with the result\r\nthat opinions were preponderantly adverse to the free range of the\r\nlibrary by readers. It was pointed out that libraries are established and\r\nmaintained at great cost for serious purposes of reading and study, and\r\nthat these ends are best subserved by systematic service at a common\r\ncentre--not by letting the readers scatter themselves about the library\r\nshelves. To one speaker who held that every one in a free public library\r\nhad the right to go to the shelves, and choose his books for himself, it\r\nwas answered that this was equivalent to saying that it is the idler's\r\nright to stroll about in every place devoted to a special business, and\r\ninterrupt that business at his pleasure.\r\n\r\nAt the International Conference of 1897, an able defence of open shelves\r\nwas presented, claiming that it saves much librarians' time in finding\r\nbooks, if readers are allowed to find them for themselves; that thefts\r\nand mutilations are inconsiderable; that it makes an appeal to the honor\r\nof people to respect the books; that the open shelf system does better\r\neducational work; that it is economical by requiring fewer library\r\nattendants; that it has grown steadily in favor in America, and that it\r\ngives the people the same right in the library which is their own, as the\r\nindividual has in his own.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it was urged that the arguments for open shelves were\r\nall arguments for anarchy; that the readers who want to rummage about for\r\nwhat they want lack proper discipline of the mind; that the number of\r\nbooks lost under it has been very large; that librarians are custodians\r\nand conservers, as well as dispensers of books; that all books misplaced\r\nare practically lost to the library for the time being; that the open\r\nshelf system requires far more space, and is more expensive; and that,\r\nhowever desirable, its general adoption is utterly impracticable.\r\n\r\nThe practice of libraries in this particular of administration differs\r\nwidely, as do the opinions of librarians regarding it. In most colleges\r\nand universities free access is allowed; and in some public free\r\nlibraries, both east and west, the readers are allowed to handle the\r\nbooks on the shelves. This is comparatively safe in the smaller town\r\nlibraries, where the books are in compact shape, and the unavoidable\r\nmisplacement can be corrected daily in no long time. The experience of\r\n\"open shelves\" in such collections has been so favorable that their\r\nlibrarians have testified that the losses were insignificant when\r\ncompared with the great public convenience resulting. But the difficulty\r\nand confusion arising from free handling of the books on shelves\r\nincreases in the direct ratio of the size of the library, until, in an\r\nextensive collection, it reaches an intolerable result.\r\n\r\nWhat is encountered continually in enforcing the rule of exclusion from\r\nshelves is the almost universal conceit that some reader is entitled to\r\nexemption from such a rule. Explain to him never so courteously that\r\nexperience has proved that a library is thrown into confusion by such\r\nadmission; that while he may be careful to replace every book handled in\r\nthe same spot, nearly all readers are careless, and he will insist that\r\nhe is the exception, and that he is always careful. That is human nature,\r\nthe world over--to believe that one can do things better than any one\r\nelse. But if such importunities prevail, the chances are that books will\r\nbe misplaced by the very literary expert who has solemnly asserted his\r\ninfallibility.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, open shelves may be viewed as an open question. It may be\r\nbest for small libraries, as to all the books, and for all libraries as\r\nto some classes of books. But make it general, and order and arrangement\r\nare at an end, while chaos takes the place of cosmos. The real student is\r\nbetter served by the knowledge and aid of the librarian, thus saving his\r\ntime for study, than he can be by ranging about dark shelves to find,\r\namong multitudes of books he does not want, the ones that he actually\r\ndoes want. The business of the librarian, and his highest use, is to\r\nbring the resources of the library to the reader. If this takes a hundred\r\nor more volumes a day, he is to have them; but to give him the right to\r\nthrow a library into confusion by \"browsing around,\" is to sacrifice the\r\nrights of the public to prompt service, to the whim of one man. Those who\r\nthink that \"browsing\" is an education should reflect that it is like any\r\nother wandering employment, fatal to fixity of purpose. Like desultory\r\nreading of infinite periodicals, it tends rather to dissipate the time\r\nand the attention than to inform and strengthen the mind.\r\n\r\nIn libraries of wide circulation in America, many have open shelves, and\r\nmany more free access to certain classes of books. The Newark Free\r\nLibrary opens all departments except fiction; others open fiction and\r\ncurrent literature only. Some libraries, notably in England, have a\r\n\"safe-guarded\" open-shelf system, by which the public are given free\r\nrange inside the library, while the librarians take post at the outside\r\nrailing, to charge books drawn, and check off depredations. This method\r\nmay be styled \"every one his own librarian,\" and is claimed by its\r\noriginators to work well.\r\n\r\nAt the Conference of the American Library Association in 1899, after\r\ndiscussion, votes were taken, showing 50 librarians in favor of free\r\naccess to shelves for small libraries, as against only 10 for\r\nunrestricted access in large libraries.\r\n\r\nThe debate brought out curious and instructive facts as to losses of\r\nbooks where free range is allowed. The Denver Public Library lost in one\r\nyear 955 volumes; the Buffalo Public Library 700 books in seventeen\r\nmonths; the Minneapolis, 300 in a year; and the St. Louis Public Library\r\n1,062 volumes in two years, out of \"a very limited open shelf\r\ncollection.\" One librarian, estimating the loss of books at $1,000 worth\r\nin two years, said the library board were perfectly satisfied, and that\r\n\"unless we lose $2,500 worth of books a year, the open-shelf system pays\r\nin its saving of the expenses of attendance.\" It does not appear to have\r\noccurred to them that a public library owes anything to the public\r\nmorality, nor that a library losing its books by the thousand, to save\r\nthe cost of proper management, may be holding out a premium to wholesale\r\nrobbery.\r\n\r\nThere is another precaution essential to be observed regarding the more\r\ncostly and rare possessions of the library. Such books should not be\r\nplaced upon the shelves with the ordinary books of the collection, but\r\nprovided for in a repository under lock and key. In a large library,\r\nwhere many hundred volumes of books of especial rarity and value are to\r\nbe found, a separate room should always exist for this class of books.\r\nThey will properly include (1) Incunabula, or early printed books; (2)\r\nManuscripts, or unique specimens, such as collections of autographs of\r\nnotable people; (3) Illuminated books, usually written on vellum, or\r\nprinted in color; (4) Early and rare Americana, or books of American\r\ndiscovery, history, etc., which are scarce and difficult to replace; (5)\r\nAny books known to be out of print; and (6) Many costly illustrated works\r\nwhich should be kept apart for only occasional inspection by readers.\r\nWhere no separate room exists for safe custody of such treasures, they\r\nshould be provided with a locked book-case or cases, according to their\r\nnumber. When any of these reserved books are called for, they should be\r\nsupplied to readers under special injunctions of careful handling.\r\nNeglect of precaution may at any time be the means of losing to the\r\nlibrary a precious volume. It is easy for an unknown reader who calls for\r\nsuch a rare or costly work, to sign his ticket with a false name, and\r\nslip the book under his coat when unobserved, and so leave the library\r\nunchallenged. But the librarian or assistant who supplies the book, if\r\nput on his guard by having to fetch it from a locked repository, should\r\nkeep the reader under observation, unless well known, until the volume\r\nis safely returned. Designing and dishonest persons are ever hovering\r\nabout public libraries, and some of the most dangerous among them are men\r\nwho know the value of books.\r\n\r\nThis class of reserved books should not be given out in circulation,\r\nunder any circumstances. Not only are they subject to injury by being\r\nhandled in households where there are children or careless persons, who\r\nsoil or deface them, but they are exposed to the continual peril of fire,\r\nand consequent loss to the library. There are often books among these\r\nrarities, which money cannot replace, because no copies can be found when\r\nwanted. In the Library of Congress, there is a very salutary safe-guard\r\nthrown around the most valuable books in the form of a library regulation\r\nwhich provides that no manuscript whatever, and no printed book of\r\nspecial rarity and value shall be taken out of the library by any person.\r\nThis restriction of course applies to Members of Congress, as well as to\r\nthose officials who have the legal right to draw books from the library.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 12.\r\n\r\nTHE FACULTY OF MEMORY.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo every reader nothing can be more important than that faculty of the\r\nmind which we call memory. The retentive memory instinctively stores up\r\nthe facts, ideas, imagery, and often the very language found in books, so\r\nclearly that they become available at any moment in after life. The\r\ntenacity of this hold upon the intellectual treasures which books contain\r\ndepends largely upon the strength of the impression made upon the mind\r\nwhen reading. And this, in turn, depends much upon the force, clearness\r\nand beauty of the author's style or expression. A crude, or feeble, or\r\nwordy, redundant statement makes little impression, while a terse, clear,\r\nwell-balanced sentence fixes the attention, and so fastens itself in the\r\nmemory. Hence the books which are best remembered will be those which are\r\nthe best written. Great as is the power of thought, we are often obliged\r\nto confess that the power of expression is greater still. When the\r\nsubstance and the style of any writing concur to make a harmonious and\r\nstrong impression on the reader's mind, the writer has achieved success.\r\nAll our study of literature tends to confirm the conviction of the\r\nsupreme importance of an effective style.\r\n\r\nWe must set down a good memory as a cardinal qualification of the\r\nlibrarian. This faculty of the mind, in fact, is more important to him\r\nthan to the members of any other profession whatever, because it is more\r\nincessantly drawn upon. Every hour in the day, and sometimes every minute\r\nin the hour, he has to recall the names of certain books, the authors of\r\nthe same, including both their surnames and Christian or forenames, the\r\nsubjects principally treated in them, the words of some proverb or\r\nquotation, or elegant extract in poetry or prose, the period of time of\r\nan author or other noted person, the standard measurements and weights in\r\nuse, with their equivalents, the moneys of foreign nations and their\r\nAmerican values, the time of certain notable events in history, whether\r\nforeign or American, ancient or modern, the names and succession of\r\nrulers, the prices of many books, the rules observed in the catalogue,\r\nboth of authors and subjects, the names and schools of great artists,\r\nwith their period, the meaning in various foreign languages of certain\r\nwords, the geographical location of any place on the earth's surface, the\r\nregion of the library in which any book is located--and, in short, an\r\ninfinitude of items of information which he wants to know out of hand,\r\nfor his own use, or in aid of Library readers or assistants. The immense\r\nvariety of these drafts upon his memory seldom perplexes one who is well\r\nendowed with a natural gift in that direction. In fact, it seems actually\r\ntrue of such minds, that the more numerous the calls upon the memory, the\r\nmore ready is the response.\r\n\r\nThe metaphysicians have spent many words in attempting to define the\r\nvarious qualities of the mind, and to account for a strong or a weak\r\nmemory; but after all is said, we find that the surprising difference\r\nbetween different memories is unaccounted for; as unaccountable, indeed,\r\nas what differences the man of genius from the mere plodder. The\r\nprinciple of association of ideas is doubtless the leading element in a\r\nmemory which is not merely verbal. We associate in our minds, almost\r\ninstinctively, ideas of time, or space, or persons, or events, and these\r\nconnect or compare one with another, so that what we want is called up\r\nor recalled in memory, by a train of endless suggestion. We all have this\r\nkind of memory, which may be termed the rational or ideal, as\r\ndistinguished from the verbal and the local memory. The verbal memory is\r\nthat which retains in the mind, and reproduces at will what has been said\r\nin our hearing by others, or what we have read which has made a marked\r\nimpression upon us. Thus, some persons can repeat with almost exact\r\naccuracy, every word of a long conversation held with another. Others can\r\nrepeat whole poems, or long passages in prose from favorite authors,\r\nafter reading them over two or three times, and can retain them perfectly\r\nin memory for half a century or more. There have even been persons to\r\nwhom one single reading of any production was sufficient to enable them\r\nto repeat it _verbatim_. These instances of a great verbal memory are by\r\nno means rare, although some of them appear almost incredible. John Locke\r\ntells us of the French philosopher Pascal, that he never forgot anything\r\nof what he had done, said, or thought, in any part of his natural life.\r\nAnd the same thing is recorded of that great scholar of Holland, Hugo\r\nGrotius.\r\n\r\nThe mathematician Euler could repeat the Aeneid of Virgil from beginning\r\nto end, containing nearly nine thousand lines. Mozart, upon hearing the\r\n_Miserere_ of Allegri played in the Sistine Chapel at Rome, only once,\r\nwent to his hotel, and wrote it all down from memory, note for note.\r\n\r\nCardinal Mezzofanti both wrote and spoke thirty languages, and was quite\r\nfamiliar with more than a hundred. He said that if he once heard the\r\nmeaning of a word in any language, he never forgot it. Yet he was of the\r\nopinion, that although he had twenty words for one idea, it was better to\r\nhave twenty ideas for one word; which is no doubt true, so far as real\r\nintellectual culture is concerned. Lord Macaulay, who had a phenomenal\r\nmemory, said that if all the copies of Milton's Paradise Lost were to be\r\ndestroyed, he could reproduce the book complete, from memory. In early\r\nlife he was a great admirer of Walter Scott's poetry, and especially the\r\n\"Lay of the Last Minstrel\", and could repeat the whole of that long poem,\r\nmore than six hundred lines, from memory. And at the age of fifty-seven\r\nhe records--\"I walked in the portico, and learned by heart the noble\r\nfourth act of the Merchant of Venice. There are four hundred lines. I\r\nmade myself perfect master of the whole in two hours.\" It was said of him\r\nthat every incident he heard of, and every page he read, \"assumed in his\r\nmind a concrete spectral form.\"\r\n\r\nBut the memory for names and words has been sometimes called the lowest\r\nform of memory. Persons of defective or impaired intellect frequently\r\nhave strong and retentive verbal memories. Mrs. Somerville records the\r\ncase of an idiot who could repeat a whole sermon _verbatim_, after once\r\nhearing it, but who was stupid and ignorant as to every thing else. And\r\nthere are many instances in the books to the same effect.\r\n\r\nAnother kind of memory may be called, for want of a better name, the\r\nlocal memory. A person who has this strongly developed, if he once goes\r\nto a place, whether a room, or a street in a city, or a road in any part\r\nof the country, knows the way again, and can find it by instinct ever\r\nafter. In the same way any one gifted with this almost unerring sense of\r\nlocality, can find any book on any shelf in any part of a library where\r\nhe has once been. He knows, in like manner, on which side of the page he\r\nsaw any given passage in a book, which impressed him at the time,\r\nalthough he may never have had the volume in his hand more than once. He\r\nmay not remember the number of the page, but he is sure of his\r\nrecollection that it was the left or the right hand one, as the case may\r\nbe, and this knowledge will abridge his labor and time in finding it\r\nagain by just one half. This local memory is invaluable to a librarian or\r\nan assistant in shortening the labor of finding things. If you have a\r\ngood local memory, you can, in no long time, come to dispense with the\r\ncatalogue and its shelf-marks or classification marks, almost entirely,\r\nin finding your books. Although this special gift of memory--the sense of\r\nlocality--is unquestionably a lower faculty of the mind than some others\r\nnamed, and although there are illiterate persons who can readily find and\r\nproduce any books in a library which have often passed through their\r\nhands, yet it is a faculty by no means to be despised. It is one of the\r\nlabor-saving, time-saving gifts, which should be welcomed by every\r\nlibrarian. The time saved from searching the catalogues for\r\nlocation-marks of the outside of books, will enable him to make many a\r\nresearch in their inside. This faculty, of course, is indefinitely\r\nstrengthened and improved by use--and the same is true of the other\r\nbranches of the sense which we call memory. The oftener you have been to\r\nany place, the better you know the way. The more frequently you have\r\nfound and produced a given book from its proper receptacle, the easier\r\nand the quicker will be your finding it again.\r\n\r\nAnother faculty or phase of memory is found in the ability to call up the\r\nimpression made by any object once seen by the eye, so as to reproduce it\r\naccurately in speech or writing. This may be termed the intuitive memory.\r\nThere are many applications or illustrations of this faculty. Thus, for\r\nexample, you see a book on some shelf in your library. You take in its\r\nsize, its binding, both the material and the color, and its title as\r\nlettered on the back. All this you absorb with one glance of the eye. You\r\nremember it by the principle of association--that is, you associate with\r\nthat particular book, in connection with its title, a certain dimension,\r\ncolor, and style of binding. Now, when you have occasion to look up that\r\nspecial volume again, you not only go, aided by your memory of locality,\r\nto the very section and shelf of the library where it belongs, but you\r\ntake with you instinctively, your memory or mental image of the book's\r\nappearance. Thus, you perhaps distinctly remember (1) that it was an\r\noctavo, and your eye in glancing along the shelf where it belongs,\r\nrejects intuitively all the duodecimos or books of lesser size, to come\r\nto the octavos. (2) Then you also remember that it was bound in leather,\r\nconsequently you pass quickly by all the cloth bound volumes on the\r\nshelf. (3) in the third place you know that its color was red; and you\r\npay no attention whatever to books of any other color, but quickly seize\r\nyour red leather-bound octavo, and bear it off to the reading-room in\r\ntriumph. Of course there are circumstances where this quick operation of\r\nthe faculties of memory and intuition combined, would not be so easy. For\r\nexample, all the books (or nearly all) on a given shelf might be octavos;\r\nor they might all be leather-bound; or a majority of them with red backs;\r\nand the presence of one or more of these conditions would eliminate one\r\nor more of the facilities for most rapidly picking out the book wanted.\r\nBut take a pile of books, we will say returned by many readers, on the\r\nlibrary counter. You are searching among them for a particular volume\r\nthat is again wanted. There is no order or arrangement of the volumes,\r\nbut you distinctly remember, from having handled it, its size both as to\r\nheight and thickness, its color, and how it was bound. You know it was a\r\nthin 12mo. in green cloth binding. Do you, in your search, take up every\r\nbook in that mass, to scrutinize its title, and see if it is the one you\r\nseek? By no means. You quickly thrust aside, one by one, or by the\r\nhalf-dozen, all the volumes which are not green, cloth-bound, thin\r\nduodecimos, without so much as glancing at them. Your special volume is\r\nquickly found among hundreds of volumes, and your faculty of memory and\r\nintuition has saved you perhaps a quarter of an hour of valuable time,\r\nwhich, without that faculty, might have been wasted in search.\r\n\r\nAgain, another circumstance which might intervene to diminish the\r\nfrequency of application of the memory referred to, as to the physical\r\nfeatures or appearance of a book sought for, is where the\r\nshelf-arrangement is alphabetical, by authors' names, or by the names of\r\nthe subjects of the books, if it is an alphabet of biographies. Here, the\r\nsurest and the quickest guide to the book is of course the alphabetical\r\norder, in which it must necessarily be found.\r\n\r\nThis memory of the aspect of any object once looked at, is further well\r\nillustrated in the very varied facilities for the spelling of words found\r\nin different persons. Thus, there are people who, when they once see any\r\nword (we will say a proper name) written or printed, can always\r\nafterwards spell that word unerringly, no matter how uncommon it may be.\r\nThe mental retina, so to speak, receives so clear and exact an impression\r\nof the form of that word from the eye, that it retains and reproduces it\r\nat will.\r\n\r\nBut there are others, (and among them persons of much learning in some\r\ndirections) upon whom the form or orthography of a word makes little or\r\nno impression, however frequently it meets the eye in reading. I have\r\nknown several fine scholars, and among them the head of an institution of\r\nlearning, who could not for the life of them spell correctly; and this\r\ninfirmity extended even to some of the commonest words in the language.\r\nWhy this inaptitude on the part of many, and this extraordinary facility\r\non the part of others, in the memorizing faculty, is a phenomenon which\r\nmay be noted down, but not solved. That vivid mental picture which is\r\nseen by the inward eye of the person favored with a good memory, is\r\nwholly wanting, or seen only dimly and rarely in the case of one who\r\neasily forgets.\r\n\r\nSo vital and important is memory, that it has been justly denominated by\r\nthe German philosopher, Kant, \"the most wonderful of our faculties.\"\r\nWithout it, the words of a book would be unintelligible to us, since it\r\nis memory alone which furnishes us with the several meanings to be\r\nattached to them.\r\n\r\nSome writers on the science of mind assert that there is no such thing\r\nwith any of us as absolutely forgetting anything that has once been in\r\nthe mind. All mental activities, all knowledge which ever existed,\r\npersists. We never wholly lose them, but they become faint and obscure.\r\nOne mental image effaces another. But those which have thus disappeared\r\nmay be recalled by an act of reminiscence. While it may sometimes be\r\nimpossible to recover one of them at the moment when wanted, by an act of\r\nvoluntary recollection, some association may bring it unexpectedly and\r\nvividly before us. Memory plays us many strange tricks, both when we wake\r\nand when we dream. It revives, by an involuntary process, an infinite\r\nvariety of past scenes, faces, events, ideas, emotions, passions,\r\nconversations, and written or printed pages, all of which we may have\r\nfancied had passed forever from our consciousness.\r\n\r\nThe aids to memory supposed to be furnished by the various mnemonic\r\nsystems may now be briefly considered. These methods of supplying the\r\ndefects of a naturally weak memory, or of strengthening a fairly good\r\none, are one and all artificial. This might not be a conclusive\r\nobjection to them, were they really effective and permanent helps,\r\nenabling one who has learned them to recall with certainty ideas, names,\r\ndates, and events which he is unable to recall by other means. Theory\r\napart, it is conceded that a system of memorizing which had proved widely\r\nor generally successful in making a good memory out of a poor one, would\r\ndeserve much credit. But experience with these systems has as yet failed\r\nto show, by the stern test of practical utility, that they can give\r\nsubstantial (and still less permanent) aid in curing the defects of\r\nmemory. Most of the systems of mnemonics that have been invented are\r\nconstructed on the principle of locality, or of utilizing objects which\r\nappeal to the sight. There is nothing new in these methods, for the\r\nprinciple is as old as Simonides, who lived in the fifth century before\r\nChrist, and who devised a system of memorizing by locality. One of the\r\nmost prevalent systems now taught is to select a number of rooms in a\r\nhouse (in the mind's eye, of course) and divide the walls and the floors\r\nof each room into nine equal parts or squares, three in a row. Then\r\n\r\n     \"On the front wall--that opposite the entrance of the first\r\n     room--are the units, on the right-hand wall the tens, on the left\r\n     hand the twenties, on the fourth wall the thirties, and on the\r\n     floor the forties. Numbers 10, 20, 30, and 40, each find a place\r\n     on the roof above their respective walls. One room will thus\r\n     furnish 50 places, and ten rooms as many as 500, while 50\r\n     occupies the centre of the roof. Having fixed these clearly in\r\n     the mind, so as to be able readily and at once to tell the exact\r\n     position of each place or number, it is then necessary to\r\n     associate with each of them some familiar object (or symbol) so\r\n     that the object being suggested, its place may be instantly\r\n     remembered, or when the place is before the mind, its object may\r\n     immediately spring up. When this has been done thoroughly, the\r\n     objects can be run over in any order from beginning to end, or\r\n     from end to beginning, or the place of any particular one can at\r\n     once be given. All that is further necessary is to associate the\r\n     ideas we wish to remember with the objects in the various places,\r\n     by which means they are readily remembered, and can be gone over\r\n     in any order. In this way, one may learn to repeat several\r\n     hundred disconnected words or ideas in any order, after hearing\r\n     them only once.\"\r\n\r\nThis rather complicated machinery for aiding the memory is quite too\r\nmechanical to commend itself to any one accustomed to reflect or to take\r\nnote of his own mental processes. Such an elaborate system crowds the\r\nmind with a lot of useless furniture, and hinders rather than helps a\r\nrational and straightforward habit of memorizing. It too much resembles\r\nthe feat of trying to jump over a wall by running back a hundred or more\r\nyards to acquire a good start or momentum. The very complication of the\r\nsystem is fitted to puzzle rather than to aid the memory. It is based on\r\nmechanical or arithmetical associations--not founded on nature, and is of\r\nvery small practical utility. It does not strengthen or improve the habit\r\nof memorizing, which should always be based upon close attention, and a\r\nlogical method of classifying, associating, and analyzing facts or ideas.\r\n\r\nLord Bacon, more than two centuries ago, wisely characterized mnemonic\r\nsystems as \"barren and useless.\" He wrote, \"For immediately to repeat a\r\nmultitude of names or words once repeated before, I esteem no more than\r\nrope-dancing, antic postures, and feats of activity; and, indeed, they\r\nare nearly the same thing, the one being the abuse of the bodily, as the\r\nother is of mental powers; and though they may cause admiration, they\r\ncannot be highly esteemed.\"\r\n\r\nIn fact, these mnemonical systems are only a kind of crutches, sometimes\r\nuseful to people who cannot walk, but actual impediments to those having\r\nthe use of their limbs, and who by proper exercise can maintain their\r\nhealthy and natural use indefinitely.\r\n\r\nI have given you an account of one of these artificial systems of memory,\r\nor systems of artificial memory, as you may choose to call them. There\r\nhave been invented more than one hundred different systems of mnemonics,\r\nall professing to be invaluable, and some claiming to be infallible. It\r\nappears to be a fatal objection to these memory-systems that they\r\nsubstitute a wholly artificial association of ideas for a natural one.\r\nThe habit of looking for accidental or arbitrary relations of names and\r\nthings is cultivated, and the power of logical, spontaneous thought is\r\ninjured by neglecting essential for unessential relations. These\r\nartificial associations of ideas work endless mischief by crowding out\r\nthe natural ones.\r\n\r\nHow then, you may ask, is a weak memory to be strengthened, or a fairly\r\ngood memory to be cultivated into a better one? The answer is, by\r\nconstant practice, and for this the vocation of a librarian furnishes far\r\nmore opportunities than any other. At the basis of this practice of the\r\nmemory, lies the habit of attention. All memory depends upon the strength\r\nor vividness of the impression made upon the mind, by the object, the\r\nname, the word, the date, which is sought to be remembered. And this, in\r\nturn, depends on the degree of attention with which it was first\r\nregarded. If the attention was so fixed that a clear mental image was\r\nformed, there will be no difficulty in remembering it again. If, on the\r\nother hand, you were inattentive, or listless, or pre-occupied with other\r\nthoughts, when you encountered the object, your impression of it would be\r\nhazy and indistinct, and no effort of memory would be likely to recall\r\nit.\r\n\r\nAttention has been defined as the fixing of the mind intently upon one\r\nparticular object, to the exclusion for a time, of all other objects\r\nsoliciting notice. It is essential to those who would have a good memory,\r\nto cultivate assiduously the habit of concentration of thought. As the\r\nscattering shot hits no mark, so the scattering and random thoughts that\r\nsweep through an unoccupied brain lead to no memorable result, simply\r\nfrom want of attention or of fixation upon some one mental vision or\r\nidea. With your attention fastened upon any subject or object, you see it\r\nmore clearly, and it impresses itself more vividly in the memory, as a\r\nnatural consequence. Not only so, but its related objects or ideas are\r\nbrought up by the principle of association, and they too make a deeper\r\nimpression and are more closely remembered. In fact, one thing carefully\r\nobserved and memorized, leads almost insensibly to another that is\r\nrelated to it, and thus the faculty of association is strengthened, the\r\nmemory is stimulated, and the seeds of knowledge are deeply planted in\r\nthat complex organism which we call the mind. This power of attention, of\r\nkeeping an object or a subject steadily in view until it is absorbed or\r\nmastered, is held by some to be the most distinctive element in genius.\r\nMost people have not this habit of concentration of the mind, but allow\r\nit to wander aimlessly on, flitting from subject to subject, without\r\nmastering any; but then, most people are not geniuses. The habit to be\r\ncultivated is that of thinking persistently of only one thing at a time,\r\nsternly preventing the attention from wandering.\r\n\r\nIt may be laid down as an axiom that the two corner-stones of memory are\r\nattention and association. And both of these must act in harmony, the\r\nhabit of fixed attention being formed or guided by the will, before a\r\nnormal or retentive memory becomes possible. What is called cultivating\r\nthe memory, therefore, does not mean anything more than close attention\r\nto whatever we wish to remember, with whatever associations naturally\r\ncling to it, until it is actually mastered. If one has not an instinctive\r\nor naturally strong memory, he should not rest satisfied with letting the\r\ndays go by until he has improved it. The way to improve it, is to begin\r\nat the foundation, and by the constant exercise of the will-power, to\r\ntake up every subject with fixed attention, and one at a time, excluding\r\nevery other for the time being. There is no doubt whatever that the\r\nmemory is capable of indefinite improvement; and though one's first\r\nefforts in that direction may prove a disappointment, because only\r\npartially successful, he should try, and try again, until he is rewarded\r\nwith the full fruits of earnest intellectual effort, in whatever field.\r\nHe may have, at the start, instead of a fine memory, what a learned\r\nprofessor called, \"a fine forgettery,\" but let him persevere to the end.\r\nNone of us were made to sit down in despair because we are not endowed\r\nwith an all-embracing memory, or because we cannot \"speak with the\r\ntongues of men and of angels,\" and do not know \"all mysteries and all\r\nknowledge.\" It rather becomes us to make the best and highest use, day by\r\nday, of the talents that are bestowed upon us, remembering that however\r\nshort of perfection they may be, we are yet far more gifted than myriads\r\nof our fellow-creatures in this very imperfect world.\r\n\r\nThere is no question that the proper cultivation of the memory is, or\r\nought to be, the chief aim of education. All else is so dependent upon\r\nthis, that it may be truly affirmed that, without memory, knowledge\r\nitself would be impossible. By giving up oneself with fixed attention to\r\nwhat one seeks to remember, and trusting the memory, though it may often\r\nfail, any person can increase his powers of memory and consequently of\r\nlearning, to an indefinite degree. To improve and strengthen the memory,\r\nit must be constantly exercised. Let it be supplied with new knowledge\r\nfrequently, and called on daily to reproduce it. If remembered only\r\nimperfectly or in part, refresh it by reference to the source whence the\r\nknowledge came; and repeat this carefully and thoroughly, until memory\r\nbecomes actually the store-house of what you know on that subject. If\r\nthere are certain kinds of facts and ideas which you more easily forget\r\nthan others, it is a good way to practice upon them, taking up a few\r\ndaily, and adding to them by degrees. Dr. W. T. Harris, the United States\r\nCommissioner of Education, gave his personal experience to the effect\r\nthat he always found it hard to remember dates. He resolved to improve a\r\nfeeble memory in this respect by learning the succession of English\r\nKings, from William the Conqueror, down to Victoria. With his\r\ncharacteristic thoroughness, he began by learning three or four dates of\r\naccession only, the first day; two new ones were added the second day;\r\nthen one new king added the third day; and thereafter even less frequency\r\nwas observed in learning the chronology. By this method he had the whole\r\ntable of thirty-six sovereigns learned, and made familiar by constant\r\nreview. It had to be learned anew one year after, and once again after\r\nyears of neglect. But his memory for dates steadily grew, and without\r\nconscious effort, dates and numbers soon came to be seized with a firmer\r\ngrasp than before. This kind of memory, he adds, now improves or\r\nincreases with him from year to year. Here is an instance of cultivation\r\nof memory by a notable scholar, who adds a monition to learners with weak\r\nmemories, not to undertake to memorize too much at once. Learning a\r\nsuccession of fifty names slowly, he says, will so discipline the memory\r\nfor names, as to partially or even permanently remove all embarrassment\r\nfrom that source. I may add that a long table of names or dates, or any\r\nprolonged extract in verse or prose, if learned by repeating it over and\r\nover as a whole, will be less tenaciously retained in memory, than if\r\ncommitted in parts.\r\n\r\nThe highest form of memory is actually unconscious, _i. e._, that in\r\nwhich what we would recall comes to us spontaneously, without effort or\r\nlapse of time in thinking about it. It is this kind of memory that has\r\nbeen possessed by all the notable persons who have been credited with\r\nknowing everything, or with never forgetting anything. It is not to be\r\nreckoned to their credit, so much as to their good fortune. What merit is\r\nthere in having a good memory, when one cannot help remembering?\r\n\r\nThere is one caution to be given to those who are learning to improve a\r\nmemory naturally weak. When such a one tries to recall a date, or name,\r\nor place, or idea, or book, it frequently happens that the endeavor fails\r\nutterly. The more he tries, the more obstinately the desired object fails\r\nto respond. As the poet Pope wrote about the witless author:\r\n\r\n    \"You beat your pate, and fancy wit will come;\r\n     Knock as you please, there's nobody at home.\"\r\n\r\nIn these cases, no attempt to force the memory should be made, nor should\r\nthe attention be kept long on the subject, for this course only injures\r\nthe faculty, and leads to confusion of mind. To persist in a constantly\r\nbaffled effort to recover a word, or other forgotten link in memory, is a\r\nlaborious attempt which is itself likely to cause failure, and induce a\r\ndistrust of the memory which is far from rational. The forgotten object\r\nwill probably recur in no long time after, when least expected.\r\n\r\nMuch discursive reading is not only injurious to the faculty of memory,\r\nbut may be positively destructive of it. The vast extent of our modern\r\nworld of reviews, magazines and newspapers, with their immense variety of\r\nsubjects, dissipates the attention instead of concentrating it, and\r\nbecomes fatal to systematic thought, tenacious memory, and the\r\nacquirement of real knowledge. The mind that is fed upon a diet of\r\nmorning and evening newspapers, mainly or solely, will become flabby,\r\nuncertain, illogical, frivolous, and, in fact, little better than a\r\nscatterbrains. As one who listens to an endless dribble of small talk\r\nlays up nothing out of all the palaver, which, to use a common phrase,\r\n\"goes in at one ear, and out at the other,\" so the reader who\r\ncontinuously absorbs all the stuff which the daily press, under the\r\npretext of \"printing the news,\" inflicts upon us, is nothing benefited in\r\nintellectual gifts or permanent knowledge. What does he learn by his\r\nassiduous pursuit of these ephemeral will o' the wisps, that only \"lead\r\nto bewilder, and dazzle to blind?\" He absorbs an incredible amount of\r\nempty gossip, doubtful assertions, trifling descriptions, apocryphal\r\nnews, and some useful, but more useless knowledge. The only visible\r\nobject of spending valuable time over these papers appears to be to\r\nsatisfy a momentary curiosity, and then the mass of material read passes\r\nalmost wholly out of the mind, and is never more thought of. Says\r\nColeridge, one of the foremost of English thinkers: \"I believe the habit\r\nof perusing periodical works may be properly added to the catalogue of\r\nanti-mnemonics, or weakeners of the memory.\"\r\n\r\nIf read sparingly, and for actual events, newspapers have a value which\r\nis all their own; but to spend hours upon them, as many do, is mere\r\nmental dissipation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 13.\r\n\r\nQUALIFICATIONS OF A LIBRARIAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn directing attention to some of the more important elements which\r\nshould enter into the character and acquirements of a librarian, I shall\r\nperhaps not treat them in the order of their relative importance. Thus,\r\nsome persons might consider the foremost qualification for one aspiring\r\nto the position of a librarian to be wide knowledge in literature and\r\nscience: others would say that the possession of sound common sense is\r\nabove all things essential; others an excellent and retentive memory;\r\nstill others might insist that business habits and administrative faculty\r\nare all-important; and others again, a zeal for learning and for\r\ncommunicating it to others.\r\n\r\nI shall not venture to pronounce what, among the multitude of talents\r\nthat are requisite to constitute a good librarian is the most requisite.\r\nSuffice it to say, that all of them which I shall notice are important,\r\nand that the order of their treatment determines nothing as to which are\r\nmore and which are less important. So much is expected of librarians that\r\nit actually appears as if a large portion of the public were of the\r\nopinion that it is the duty of him who has a library in charge to possess\r\nhimself, in some occult or mysterious way, unknown to the common mind, of\r\nall the knowledge which all the books combine.\r\n\r\nThe Librarian of the British Museum, speaking to a conference of\r\nlibrarians in London, quoted a remark of Pattison, in his \"Life of\r\nCasaubon,\" that \"the librarian who reads is lost.\" This was certainly\r\ntrue of that great scholar Casaubon, who in his love for the contents of\r\nthe books under his charge, forgot his duties as a librarian. And it is\r\nto a large degree true of librarians in general, that those who pursue\r\ntheir own personal reading or study during library hours do it at the\r\nexpense of their usefulness as librarians. They must be content with such\r\nsnatches of reading as come in the definite pursuit of some object of\r\nresearch incident to their library work, supplemented by such reading\r\ntime as unoccupied evenings, Sundays, and annual vacations may give them.\r\n\r\nYet nothing is more common than for applicants for the position of\r\nlibrarians or assistant librarians to base their aspiration upon the\r\nfoolish plea that they are \"so fond of reading\", or that they \"have\r\nalways been in love with books.\" So far from this being a qualification,\r\nit may become a disqualification. Unless combined with habits of\r\npractical, serious, unremitting application to labor, the taste for\r\nreading may seduce its possessor into spending the minutes and the hours\r\nwhich belong to the public, in his own private gratification. The\r\nconscientious, the useful librarian, living amid the rich intellectual\r\ntreasures of centuries, the vast majority of which he has never read,\r\nmust be content daily to enact the part of Tantalus, in the presence of a\r\ntempting and appetizing banquet which is virtually beyond his reach.\r\n\r\nBut he may console himself by the reflection that comparatively few of\r\nthe books upon his shelves are so far worth reading as to be essential.\r\n\"If I had read as many books as other men,\" said Hobbes of Malmesbury, \"I\r\nshould have been as ignorant as they.\"\r\n\r\nIf the librarian, in the precious time which is indisputably his, reads a\r\nwise selection of the best books, the masterpieces of the literature of\r\nall lands, which have been consecrated by time and the suffrages of\r\nsuccessive generations of readers, he can well afford to apply to the\r\nrest, the short-hand method recommended in a former chapter, and skim\r\nthem in the intervals of his daily work, instead of reading them. Thus he\r\nwill become sufficiently familiar with the new books of the day (together\r\nwith the information about their contents and merits furnished by the\r\nliterary reviews, which he must read, however sparingly, in order to keep\r\nup with his profession) to be able to furnish readers with some word of\r\ncomment as to most books coming into the Library. This course, or as\r\nclose an approximation to it as his multifarious duties will permit, will\r\ngo far to solve the problem that confronts every librarian who is\r\nexpected to be an exponent of universal knowledge. Always refraining from\r\nunqualified praise of books (especially of new ones) always maintaining\r\nthat impartial attitude toward men and opinions which becomes the\r\nlibrarian, he should act the part of a liberal, eclectic, catholic guide\r\nto inquirers of every kind.\r\n\r\nAnd here let me emphasize the great importance to every librarian or\r\nassistant of early learning to make the most of his working faculties. He\r\ncannot afford to plod along through a book, sentence by sentence, like an\r\nordinary reader. He must learn to read a sentence at a glance. The moment\r\nhis eye lights upon a title-page he should be able to take it all in by a\r\ncomprehensive and intuitive mental process. Too much stress cannot be\r\nlaid upon the every-day habit or method of reading. It makes all the\r\ndifference between time saved, and time wasted; between efficiency and\r\ninefficiency; between rapid progress and standing still, in one's daily\r\nwork. No pains should be spared, before entering upon the all-engrossing\r\nwork of a library, to acquire the habit of rapid reading. An eminent\r\nlibrarian of one of the largest libraries was asked whether he did not\r\nfind a great deal of time to read? His reply was--\"I wish that I could\r\never get as much as one hour a day for reading--but I have never been\r\nable to do it.\" Of course every librarian must spend much time in special\r\nresearches; and in this way a good deal of some of his days will be spent\r\nin acquainting himself with the resources of his library; but this is\r\nincidental and not systematic reading.\r\n\r\nIn viewing the essential qualifications of a librarian, it is necessary\r\nto say at the outset that a library is no place for uneducated people.\r\nThe requirements of the position are such as to demand not only native\r\ntalent above the average, but also intellectual acquirements above the\r\naverage. The more a librarian knows, the more he is worth, and the\r\nconverse of the proposition is equally true, that the less he knows the\r\nless he is worth. Before undertaking the arduous task of guiding others\r\nin their intellectual pursuits, one should make sure that he is himself\r\nso well-grounded in learning that he can find the way in which to guide\r\nthem. To do this, he must indispensably have something more than a\r\nsmattering of the knowledge that lies at the foundation of his\r\nprofession. He must be, if not widely read, at least carefully grounded\r\nin history, science, literature, and art. While he may not, like Lord\r\nBacon, take all knowledge to be his province, because he is not a Lord\r\nBacon, nor if he were, could he begin to grasp the illimitable domain of\r\nbooks of science and literature which have been added to human knowledge\r\nin the two centuries and a half since Bacon wrote, he can at least, by\r\nwise selection, master enough of the leading works in each field, to make\r\nhim a well-informed scholar. That great treasury of information on the\r\nwhole circle of the sciences, and the entire range of literature, the\r\nEncyclopaedia Britannica, judiciously studied, will alone give what would\r\nappear to the average mind, a very liberal education.\r\n\r\nOne of the most common and most inconsiderate questions propounded to a\r\nlibrarian is this: \"Do you ever expect to read all these books through?\"\r\nand it is well answered by propounding another question, namely--\"Did\r\n_you_ ever read your dictionary through?\" A great library is the\r\nscholar's dictionary--not to be read through, but to enable him to put\r\nhis finger on the fact he wants, just when it is wanted.\r\n\r\nA knowledge of some at least of the foreign languages is indispensable to\r\nthe skilled librarian. In fact, any one aspiring to become an assistant\r\nin any large library, or the head of any small one, should first acquire\r\nat least an elementary knowledge of French and Latin. Aside from books in\r\nother languages than English which necessarily form part of every\r\nconsiderable library, there are innumerable quotations or words in\r\nforeign tongues scattered through books and periodicals in English, which\r\na librarian, appealed to by readers who are not scholars, would be\r\nmortified if found unable to interpret them. The librarian who does not\r\nunderstand several languages will be continually at a loss in his daily\r\nwork. A great many important catalogues, and bibliographies, essential\r\nparts of the equipment of a library, will be lost to him as aids, and he\r\ncan neither select foreign books intelligently nor catalogue them\r\nproperly. If he depends upon the aid of others more expert, his position\r\nwill be far from agreeable or satisfactory. How many and what foreign\r\nlanguages should be learned may be matter for wide difference of opinion.\r\nBut so far-reaching is the prevalence of the Latin, as one of the\r\nprincipal sources of our own language, and of other modern tongues, that\r\na knowledge of it is most important. And so rich is the literature of\r\nFrance, to say nothing of the vast number of French words constantly\r\nfound in current English and American books and periodicals, that at\r\nleast a fairly thorough mastery of that language should be acquired. The\r\nsame may be said of the German, which is even more important in some\r\nparts of the United States, and which has a literature most copious and\r\nvaluable in every varied department of knowledge. With these three\r\ntongues once familiar, the Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Dutch, and\r\nScandinavian languages may be, through the aid of dictionaries, so far\r\nutilized as to enable one to read titles and catalogue books in any of\r\nthem, although a knowledge of all, so as to be able to read books in\r\nthem, is highly desirable.\r\n\r\nIn the Boston Public Library, the assistants are required to possess an\r\nadequate knowledge of Latin, French, and German. And all candidates for\r\npositions in the reading-room of the British Museum Library must undergo\r\na thorough test examination as to their knowledge of the Latin language.\r\nOpportunities for acquiring foreign languages are now so abundant that\r\nthere is small excuse for any one who wants to know French, Latin or\r\nGerman, and yet goes through life without learning them. There are even\r\nways of learning these languages with sufficient thoroughness for reading\r\npurposes without a teacher, and sometimes without a text-book. Two\r\nassistant librarians taught themselves French and German in their\r\nevenings, by setting out to read familiar works of English fiction in\r\ntranslations into those languages, and soon acquired a good working\r\nknowledge of both, so as to be able to read any work in either, with only\r\noccasional aid from the dictionary for the less common words. It is\r\nsurprising how soon one can acquire a sufficient vocabulary in any\r\nlanguage, by reading any of its great writers. A good way for a beginner\r\nto learn French without a master is to take a French New Testament, and\r\nread the four Gospels through. After doing this three or four times,\r\nalmost any one who is at all familiar with the Scriptures, will be able\r\nto read most books in the French language with facility. In the great art\r\nof learning, all doors are easily unlocked--by those who have the key.\r\n\r\nIt should go without saying that the librarian should possess a wide\r\nknowledge of books. This knowledge should include (1) an acquaintance\r\nwith ancient and modern literature, so as to be able to characterize the\r\nnotable writers in each of the leading languages of the world; (2) a\r\nknowledge of history extensive enough to enable him to locate all the\r\ngreat characters, including authors, in their proper century and country;\r\n(3) a knowledge of editions, so as to discriminate between the old and\r\nthe new, the full and the abridged, the best edited, best printed, etc.;\r\n(4) an acquaintance with the intrinsic value or the subject and scope of\r\nmost of the great books of the world; (5) a knowledge of commercial\r\nvalues, so as to be able to bid or to buy understandingly, and with\r\nproper economy; (6) a familiarity with what constitutes condition in\r\nlibrary books, and with binding and repairing processes, for the\r\nrestoration of imperfect volumes for use.\r\n\r\nThe librarian should be one who has had the benefit of thorough\r\npreliminary training, for no novice is qualified to undertake the role of\r\nan expert, and any attempt to do so can result only in disappointment and\r\nfailure. No one who has read little or nothing but novels since leaving\r\nschool need ever hope to succeed.\r\n\r\nNo librarian can know too much, since his work brings him into relation\r\nwith the boundless domain of human knowledge. He should not be a\r\nspecialist in science (except in the one science of bibliography) but\r\nmust be content with knowing a little about a great many things, rather\r\nthan knowing everything about one thing. Much converse with books must\r\nfill him with a sense of his own ignorance. The more he comes to know,\r\nthe wider will open before him the illimitable realm of what is yet to\r\nbe known. In the lowest deep which research the most profound can reach,\r\nthere is a lower deep still unattained--perhaps, even, unattainable. But\r\nthe fact that he cannot by any possibility master all human knowledge\r\nshould not deter the student from making ever advancing inroads upon that\r\ndomain. The vast extent of the world of books only emphasizes the need of\r\nmaking a wise selection from the mass. We are brought inevitably back to\r\nthat precept by every excursion that we make into whatever field of\r\nliterature.\r\n\r\nThe librarian should possess, besides a wide acquaintance with books, a\r\nfaculty of administration, and this rests upon careful business habits.\r\nHe should have a system in all the library work. Every assistant should\r\nhave a prescribed task, and be required to learn and to practice all the\r\nmethods peculiar to library economy, including the economy of time. Each\r\nday's business should be so organized as to show an advance at the end.\r\nThe library must of course have rules, and every rule should be so simple\r\nand so reasonable that it will commend itself to every considerate reader\r\nor library assistant. All questions of doubt or dispute as to the\r\nobservance of any regulation, should be decided at once, courteously but\r\nfirmly, and in a few words. Nothing can be more unseemly than a wrangle\r\nin a public library over some rule or its application, disturbing readers\r\nwho are entitled to silence, and consuming time that should be given to\r\nthe service of the public.\r\n\r\nWhen Thomas Carlyle, one of the great scholars of modern times, testified\r\nin 1848 before a Parliamentary Commission upon the British Museum\r\nLibrary, he thus spoke of the qualifications of a librarian:\r\n\r\n\"All must depend upon the kind of management you get within the library\r\nitself. You must get a good pilot to steer the ship, or you will never\r\nget into the harbor. You must have a man to direct who knows well what\r\nthe duty is that he has to do, and who is determined to go through that,\r\nin spite of all clamor raised against him; and who is not anxious to\r\nobtain approbation, but is satisfied that he will obtain it by and by,\r\nprovided he acts ingenuously and faithfully.\"\r\n\r\nAnother quality most important in a librarian is an even temper. He\r\nshould be always and unfailingly courteous, not only to scholars and\r\nvisitors of high consideration, but to every reader, however humble or\r\nignorant, and to every employee, however subordinate in position. There\r\nis nothing which more detracts from one's usefulness than a querulous\r\ntemper. Its possessor is seldom happy himself, and is the frequent cause\r\nof unhappiness in others. Visitors and questions should never be met with\r\na clouded brow. A cheerful \"good-morning\" goes a great way oftentimes.\r\nMany library visitors come in a complaining mood--it may be from long\r\nwaiting to be served, or from mistake in supplying them with the wrong\r\nbooks, or from errors in charging their accounts, or from some fancied\r\nneglect or slight, or from any other cause. The way to meet such\r\nill-humored or offended readers is to gently explain the matter, with\r\nthat \"soft answer which turneth away wrath.\" Many a foolish and useless\r\naltercation may thus be avoided, and the complainant restored to\r\ncheerfulness, if not to courtesy; whereas, if the librarian were to meet\r\nthe case with a sharp or haughty answer, it would probably end without\r\nsatisfaction on either side. Whatever you do, never permit yourself to be\r\nirritable, and resolve never to be irritated. It will make you unhappy,\r\nand will breed irritation in others. Cheerfulness under all\r\ncircumstances, however difficult, is the duty and the interest of the\r\nlibrarian. Thus he will cultivate successfully an obliging disposition,\r\nwhich is a prime requisite to his success with the public and his\r\nusefulness as a librarian.\r\n\r\nIt ought not to be requisite to insist upon good health as a condition\r\nprecedent for any one aspiring to be a librarian. So very much depends\r\nupon this, that it should form a part of the conscientious duty of every\r\none to acquire and maintain a sound condition of physical health, as a\r\nmost important adjunct of a thoroughly sound and healthy condition of the\r\nmind. This is easier than most persons are aware. If we except inherited\r\nconstitutional weaknesses, or maladies of a serious character, there is\r\nalmost no one who is not able by proper diet, regimen, and daily\r\nexercise, to maintain a degree of health which will enable him to use his\r\nbrain to its full working capacity. It demands an intelligent and\r\nwatchful care of the daily regimen, so that only simple and wholesome\r\nfood and drink may be taken into the system, and what is equally\r\nimportant, adequate sleep, and habitual moderate exercise. No one can\r\nmaintain perfect health without breathing good unadulterated air, and\r\nexercising in it with great frequency. One's walks to and from the\r\nlibrary may be sufficient to give this, and it is well to have the motive\r\nof such a walk, since exercise taken for the mere purpose of it is of far\r\nless value. The habit of taking drugs, or going to a doctor for every\r\nlittle malady, is most pernicious. Every one, and especially a librarian,\r\nwho is supposed (however erroneously) to know everything, should know\r\nmore of his own constitution than any physician. With a few judicious\r\nexperiments in daily regimen, and a little abstinence now and then, he\r\ncan subdue head-aches, catarrhs and digestive troubles, and by exercising\r\nan intelligent will, can generally prevent their recurrence. If one finds\r\nhimself in the morning in a state of languor and lassitude, be sure he\r\nhas abused some physical function, and apply a remedy. An invalid will\r\nmake a poorly equipped librarian. How can a dyspeptic who dwells in the\r\ndarkness of a disease, be a guiding light to the multitudes who beset him\r\nevery hour? There are few callings demanding as much mental and physical\r\nsoundness and alertness as the care of a public library.\r\n\r\nSound common sense is as essential to the librarian as sound health. He\r\nshould always take the practical straightforward view of every item of\r\nlibrary business and management, remembering that the straight road is\r\nalways the shortest way between two points. While he may be full of\r\nideas, he should be neither an idealist nor a dreamer. In library\r\nmethods, the cardinal requisites to be aimed at, are utility and\r\nconvenience. A person of the most perfect education, and the highest\r\nliterary attainments, but destitute of common sense, will not succeed in\r\nthe conduct of a library. That intuitive judgment, which sees the reason\r\nof everything at a glance, and applies the proper agencies to the case in\r\nhand, is wanting in his composition. Multitudes of emergencies arise in\r\nlibrary service, where the prompt and practical sense of the librarian is\r\nrequired to settle a dispute, adjust a difficulty, or to direct what is\r\nto be done in some arrangement or re-arrangement of books, or some\r\nlibrary appliance or repair. In such cases, the unpractical or\r\nimpracticable man will be very likely to decide wrongly, choosing the\r\ninconvenient method instead of the convenient, the more costly instead of\r\nthe more economical, the laborious in place of the obvious and easy; in\r\nshort, some way of doing the work or settling the difficulty which will\r\nnot permit it to stay settled, or will require the work to be done over\r\nagain. The man of common-sense methods, on the other hand, will at once\r\nsee the end from the beginning, anticipate every difficulty, and decide\r\nupon the proper course without trouble or hesitation, finding his\r\njudgment fully vindicated by the result.\r\n\r\nThe librarian in whom the quality of common sense is well developed will\r\nbe ever ready to devise or to accept improvements in library methods.\r\nNever a slave to \"red tape,\" he will promptly cut it wherever and\r\nwhenever it stands in the way of the readiest service of books and\r\ninformation to all comers.\r\n\r\nAnother quality which every librarian or assistant in a library should\r\npossess is a thorough love of his work. He should cherish a noble\r\nenthusiasm for the success and usefulness of the institution with which\r\nhe has chosen to be associated. Nor should this spirit be by any means\r\nlimited to the literary and scientific aid which he is enabled to extend\r\nto others, nor to the acquisition of the knowledge requisite to meet the\r\nendless inquiries that are made of him. He should take as much interest\r\nin restoring a broken binding, or in seeing that a torn leaf is repaired,\r\nas in informing a great scholar what the library contains upon any\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nNo one who is listless or indifferent in the discharge of daily duties is\r\nfit for a place in a public library. There should be an _esprit de\r\ncorps_, a zeal for his profession, which will lead him to make almost any\r\nsacrifice of outside interests to become proficient in it. Thus only will\r\nhe render himself indispensable in his place, and do the greatest amount\r\nof service to the greatest number of readers. I have seen employees in\r\nlibraries so utterly careless of what belongs to their vocation, as to\r\nlet books, totally unfit for use, ragged or broken, or with plates\r\nloosened, ready to drop out and disappear, go back to the shelves\r\nunrepaired, to pursue the downward road toward destruction. And I have\r\nbeen in many libraries in which the books upon the shelves exhibited such\r\nutter want of care, such disarrangement, such tumbling about and\r\nupside-down chaos, and such want of cleanliness, as fairly to make one's\r\nheart ache. In some cases this may have been due in great part to unwise\r\nfree admission of the public to the shelves, and consequent inevitable\r\ndisorder; in others, it may be partially excused by the librarian's\r\nabsolute want of the needful help or time, to keep the library in order;\r\nbut in others, it was too apparent that the librarian in charge took no\r\ninterest in the condition of the books. Too many librarians (at least of\r\nthe past, however it may now be) have been of the class described by Dr.\r\nPoole, the Chicago librarian. He said that library trustees too often\r\nappeared to think that anybody almost would do for a librarian; men who\r\nhave failed in everything else, broken-down clergymen, or unsuccessful\r\nteachers, and the like.\r\n\r\nPassing now to other needful qualifications of librarians and library\r\nassistants, let me say that one of the foremost is accuracy. Perhaps I\r\nhave before this remarked that exact accuracy is one of the rarest of\r\nhuman qualities. Even an approximation to it is rare, and absolute\r\naccuracy is still rarer. Beware of the person who is sure of every\r\nthing--who retails to you a conversation he has heard, affecting to give\r\nthe exact words of a third person, or who quotes passages in verse or in\r\nprose, with glib assurance, as the production of some well-known writer.\r\nThe chances are ten to one that the conversation is mainly manufactured\r\nin the brain of the narrator, and that the quotation is either not\r\nwritten by the author to whom it is attributed, or else is a travesty of\r\nhis real language. It is Lord Byron who tells of that numerous class of\r\nsciolists whom one finds everywhere--\r\n\r\n    \"With just enough of learning to misquote.\"\r\n\r\nThe books one reads abound in erroneous dates, mistaken names, garbled\r\nextracts, and blundering quotations. So much the more important is it to\r\nthe librarian, who is so continually drawn upon for correct information\r\nupon every subject, to make sure of his facts, before communicating them.\r\nWhen (as frequently happens) he has no way of verifying them, he should\r\nreport them, not as his own conclusions, but on the authority of the book\r\nor periodical where found. This will relieve him of all responsibility,\r\nif they turn out to be erroneous. Whenever I find a wrong date or name in\r\na printed book, or an erroneous reference in the index, or a mis-spelled\r\nword, I always pencil the correct date, or name, or page of reference in\r\nthe margin. This I do as a matter of instinct, as well as of duty, for\r\nthe benefit of future inquirers, so that they may not be misled. I speak\r\nhere of errors which are palpable, or of the inaccuracy of which I have\r\npositive knowledge; if in doubt, I either let the matter go entirely, or\r\nwrite a query in pencil at the place, with the presumed correct\r\nsubstitute appended.\r\n\r\nNever be too sure of what you find in books; but prove all things and\r\nhold fast to those only which you find to be beyond dispute. Thus will\r\nyou save yourself from falling into many errors, and from recanting many\r\nopinions. It is the method of ordinary education to take everything for\r\ngranted; it is the method of science to take nothing for granted.\r\n\r\nI may refer here to another rule always to be observed, and pertaining to\r\nthe theme of strict accuracy in your daily work. That is, the necessity\r\nof carefully examining every piece of work you may have done, before it\r\nleaves your hands, for the purpose of correcting errors. All of us are\r\nnot only liable to make mistakes, but all of us do make them; and if any\r\none has a conceit of his own accuracy, the surest way to take it out of\r\nhim is to let him serve an apprenticeship in some library, where there\r\nis competent revision of all the labor performed. There are multitudes of\r\nassistants in libraries who cannot write a letter, even, without making\r\none or more errors. How often do you leave out a word in your writing\r\nexperience, which may change the meaning of a whole sentence? So, in\r\nwriting titles, whether for the catalogue, or for a library order, or for\r\nthe information of some inquirer, you are liable to make errors of date,\r\nor edition, or place of publication, or size, or to misplace or omit or\r\nsubstitute some word in the description of the book. There is nothing in\r\nthe world quite so easy as to be mistaken: and the only remedy (and it is\r\nan all-essential one) is to go over every line and every word of what you\r\nhave written, before it leaves your hands. As second thoughts are\r\nproverbially best, so a second careful glance over a piece of writing\r\nwill almost always reveal some error or omission to be corrected. Think\r\nof the mortification you must feel at finding an unverified piece of work\r\nreturned upon your hands, with several glaring mistakes marked by the\r\nreviser! Think, on the other hand, of the inward satisfaction experienced\r\nwhen you have done your best, written and revised your own work, and\r\nfound it always passed as perfect. I have tried many persons by many\r\ntests, and while I have found a great number who were industrious,\r\nintelligent, zealous, conscientious, good-tempered, and expeditious, I\r\nhave found scarcely one who was always accurate. One of the rarest things\r\nin a library is to find an assistant who has an unerring sense of the\r\nFrench accents. This knowledge, to one expert in that language, even if\r\nhe does not speak it, should be as intuitive as the art of spelling\r\ncorrectly, either in English or French. He should write the proper accent\r\nover a letter just as infallibly as he writes the proper letters in a\r\nword. But, strange to say, it is very common, even with good French\r\nscholars (in the book-sense or literary sense of scholarship) to find\r\nthem putting the acute accent for the grave over a vowel, or the grave\r\ninstead of the acute, or omitting the circumflex accent entirely, and so\r\non.\r\n\r\nEvery one commits errors, but the wise man is he who learns by his\r\nmistakes, and applies the remedy. The best remedy (as I said in the case\r\nof memory in another chapter,) is to cultivate a habit of trained\r\nattention in whatever we do. Yet many people (and I am afraid we must say\r\nmost people) go on through life, making the same blunders, and repeating\r\nthem. It appears as if the habit of inaccuracy were innate in the human\r\nrace, and only to be reformed by the utmost painstaking, and even with\r\nthe aid of that, only by a few. I have had to observe and correct such\r\nnumberless errors in the work of well-educated, adult, and otherwise\r\naccomplished persons, as filled me with despair. Yet there is no more\r\ndoubt of the improvability of the average mind, however inaccurate at the\r\nstart, than of the power of the will to correct other bad habits into\r\nwhich people unconsciously fall.\r\n\r\nOne of the requisites of a successful librarian is a faculty of order and\r\nsystem, applied throughout all the details of library administration.\r\nWithout these, the work will be performed in a hap-hazard, slovenly\r\nmanner, and the library itself will tend to become a chaos. Bear in mind\r\nthe great extent and variety of the objects which come under the care of\r\nthe librarian, all of which are to be classified and reduced to order.\r\nThese include not only books upon every earthly subject (and very many\r\nupon unearthly ones) but a possibly wide range of newspapers and\r\nperiodicals, a great mass of miscellaneous pamphlets, sometimes of maps\r\nand charts, of manuscripts and broadsides, and frequently collections of\r\nengravings, photographs, and other pictures, all of which come in to form\r\na part of most libraries. This great complexity of material, too,\r\nexhibits only the physical aspect of the librarian's labors. There are,\r\nbesides, the preparation, arrangement and continuation of the catalogue,\r\nin its three or more forms, the charging and crediting of the books in\r\ncirculation, the searching of many book lists for purchases, the library\r\nbills and accounts, the supervision and revision of the work of\r\nassistants, the library correspondence, often requiring wide researches\r\nto answer inquiries, the continual aid to readers, and a multitude of\r\nminor objects of attention quite too numerous to name. Is it any\r\nover-statement of the case to say that the librarian who has to organize\r\nand provide for all this physical and intellectual labor, should be\r\nsystematic and orderly in a high degree?\r\n\r\nThat portion of his responsible task which pertains to the arrangement\r\nand classification of books has been elsewhere treated. But there is\r\nrequired in addition, a faculty of arranging his time, so as to meet\r\nseasonably the multifarious drafts upon it. He should early learn not\r\nonly the supreme value of moments, but how to make all the library hours\r\nfruitful of results. To this end the time should be apportioned with\r\ncareful reference to each department of library service. One hour may be\r\nset for revising one kind of work of assistants; another for a different\r\none; another for perusing sale catalogues, and marking _desiderata_ to be\r\nlooked up in the library catalogue; another for researches in aid of\r\nreaders or correspondents; still another for answering letters on the\r\nmany subjects about which librarians are constantly addressed; and still\r\nanother for a survey of all the varied interests of the library and its\r\nfrequenters, to see what features of the service need strengthening, what\r\nimprovements can be made, what errors corrected, and how its general\r\nusefulness can be increased. So to apportion one's time as to get out of\r\nthe day (which is all too short for what is to be done in it) the utmost\r\nof accomplishment is a problem requiring much skill, as well as the\r\nability to profit by experience. One has always to be subject to\r\ninterruptions--and these must be allowed for, and in some way made up\r\nfor. Remember, when you have lost valuable time with some visitor whose\r\nclaims to your attention are paramount, that when to-morrow comes one\r\nshould take up early the arrears of work postponed, and make progress\r\nwith them, even though unable to finish them.\r\n\r\nAnother suggestion; proper system in the management and control of one's\r\ntime demands that none of it be absorbed by trifles or triflers; and so\r\nevery librarian must indispensably know how to get rid of bores. One may\r\nalmost always manage to effect this without giving offense, and at the\r\nsame time without wasting any time upon them, which is the one thing\r\nneedful. The bore is commonly one who, having little or nothing to do,\r\ninflicts himself upon the busy persons of his acquaintance, and\r\nespecially upon the ones whom he credits with knowing the most--to wit,\r\nthe librarians. Receive him courteously, but keep on steadily at the work\r\nyou are doing when he enters. If you are skilful, you can easily do two\r\nthings at once, for example, answer your idler friend or your bore, and\r\nrevise title-cards, or mark a catalogue, or collate a book, or look up a\r\nquotation, or write a letter, at the same time. Never lose your good\r\nhumor, never say that your time is valuable, or that you are very busy;\r\nnever hint at his going away; but never quit your work, answer questions\r\ncheerfully, and keep on, allowing nothing to take your eyes off your\r\nbusiness. By and by he will take the hint, if not wholly pachydermatous,\r\nand go away of his own accord. By pursuing this course I have saved\r\ninfinite time, and got rid of infinite bores, by one and the same\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\nThe faculty of organizing one's work is essential, in order to efficiency\r\nand accomplishment. If you do not have a plan and adhere to it, if you\r\nlet this, that, and the other person interrupt you with trifling gossip,\r\nor unnecessary requests, you will never get ahead of your work; on the\r\ncontrary, your work will always get ahead of you. The same result will\r\nfollow if you interrupt yourself, by yielding to the temptation of\r\nreading just a page or a paragraph of something that attracts your eye\r\nwhile at work. This dissipation of time, to say nothing of its unfair\r\nappropriation of what belongs to the library, defeats the prompt\r\naccomplishment of the work in hand, and fosters the evil habit of\r\nscattering your forces, in idleness and procrastination.\r\n\r\nIt ought not to be needful to urge habits of neatness and the love of\r\norder upon candidates for places in libraries. How much a neat and\r\ncarefully arranged shelf of books appeals to one's taste, I need not say,\r\nnor urge the point how much an orderly and neatly kept room, or desk, or\r\ntable adds to one's comfort. The librarian who has the proper spirit of\r\nhis calling should take pains to make the whole library look neat and\r\nattractive, to have a place for everything, and everything in its place.\r\nThis, with adequate space existing, will be found easier than to have the\r\nbooks and other material scattered about in confusion, thus requiring\r\nmuch more time to find them when wanted. A slovenly-kept library is\r\ncertain to provoke public criticism, and this always tells to the\r\ndisadvantage of the librarian; while a neatly kept, carefully arranged\r\ncollection of books is not only pleasing to the eye, but elicits\r\nfavorable judgment from all visitors.\r\n\r\nAmong the qualities that should enter into the composition of a\r\nsuccessful librarian must be reckoned an inexhaustible patience. He will\r\nbe sorely tried in his endeavors to satisfy his own ideals, and sometimes\r\nstill more sorely in his efforts to satisfy the public. Against the\r\nmistakes and short-comings of assistants, the ignorance of many readers,\r\nand the unreasonable expectations of others, the hamperings of library\r\nauthorities, and the frequently unfounded criticisms of the press, he\r\nshould arm himself with a patience and equanimity that are unfailing.\r\nWhen he knows he is right, he should never be disturbed at complaint, nor\r\nsuffer a too sensitive mood to ruffle his feelings. When there is any\r\nfoundation for censure, however slight, he should learn by it and apply\r\nthe remedy. The many and varied characters who come within the\r\ncomprehensive sphere of the librarian necessarily include people of all\r\ntempers and dispositions, as well as of every degree of culture. To be\r\ngracious and courteous to all is his interest as well as his duty. With\r\nthe ignorant he will often have to exercise a vast amount of patience,\r\nbut he should never betray a supercilious air, as though looking down\r\nupon them from the height of his own superior intelligence. To be always\r\namiable toward inferiors, superiors, and equals, is to conciliate the\r\nregard of all. Courtesy costs so little, and makes so large a return in\r\nproportion to the investment, that it is surprising not to find it\r\nuniversal. Yet it is so far from being so that we hear people praising\r\none whose manners are always affable, as if he were deserving of special\r\ncredit for it, as an exception to the general rule. It is frequently\r\nobserved that a person of brusque address or crusty speech begets\r\ncrustiness in others. There are subtle currents of feeling in human\r\nintercourse, not easy to define, but none the less potent in effect. A\r\nperson of marked suavity of speech and bearing radiates about him an\r\natmosphere of good humor, which insensibly influences the manners and the\r\nspeech of others.\r\n\r\nThere will often come into a public library a man whose whole manner is\r\naggressive and over-bearing, who acts and talks as if he had a right to\r\nthe whole place, including the librarian. No doubt, being a citizen, he\r\nhas every right, except the right to violate the rules--or to make\r\nhimself disagreeable. The way to meet him is to be neither aggressive,\r\nnor submissive and deferential, but with a cool and pleasant courtesy,\r\nignoring any idea of unpleasant feeling on your part. You will thus at\r\nleast teach a lesson in good manners, which may or may not be learned,\r\naccording to circumstances and the hopeful or hopeless character of the\r\npupil.\r\n\r\nClosely allied to the virtue of patience, is that of unfailing tact. This\r\nwill be found an important adjunct in the administration of a public\r\nlibrary. How to meet the innumerable inquiries made of him with just the\r\nproper answer, saying neither too much, nor too little, to be civil to\r\nall, without needless multiplication of words, this requires one to hold\r\nhis faculties well in hand, never to forget himself, and to show that no\r\ndemand whatever can vex or fluster him. The librarian should know how, or\r\nlearn how to adapt himself to all readers, and how to aid their\r\nresearches without devoting much time to each. This requires a fine\r\nquality of tact, of adapting one's self quickly to the varied\r\ncircumstances of the case in hand. One who has it well developed will go\r\nthrough the manifold labors and interviews and annoyances of the day\r\nwithout friction, while one who is without tact will be worried and\r\nfretted until life seems to him a burden.\r\n\r\nNeed I mention, after all that has been said of the exacting labors that\r\ncontinually wait upon the librarian, that he should be possessed both of\r\nenergy and untiring industry? By the very nature of the calling to which\r\nhe is dedicated, he is pledged to earnest and thorough work in it. He\r\ncannot afford to be a trifler or a loiterer on the way, but must push on\r\ncontinually. He should find time for play, it is true, and for reading\r\nfor his own recreation and instruction, but that time should be out of\r\nlibrary hours. And a vigilant and determined economy of time in library\r\nhours will be found a prime necessity. I have dwelt elsewhere upon the\r\nimportance of choosing the shortest methods in every piece of work to be\r\naccomplished. Equally important is it to cultivate economy of speech, or\r\nthe habit of condensing instructions to assistants, and answers to\r\ninquiries into the fewest words. A library should never be a\r\ncircumlocution office. The faculty of condensed expression, though\r\nsomewhat rare, can be cultivated.\r\n\r\nIn the relations existing between librarian and assistants there should\r\nbe mutual confidence and support. All are equally interested in the\r\ncredit and success of the institution which engages their services, and\r\nall should labor harmoniously to that end. Loyalty to one's employers is\r\nboth the duty and the interest of the employed: and the reciprocal duty\r\nof faithfulness to those employed, and interest in their improvement and\r\nsuccess should mark the intercourse of the librarian with his assistants.\r\nHe should never be too old nor too wise to learn, and should welcome\r\nsuggestions from every intelligent aid. I have suggested the importance\r\nof an even temper in the relations between librarians and readers; and it\r\nis equally important as between all those associated in the\r\nadministration of a library. Every one has faults and weaknesses; and\r\nthose encountered in others will be viewed with the most charity by those\r\nwho are duly conscious of their own. Every one makes mistakes, and these\r\nare often provoking or irritating to one who knows better; but a mild and\r\npleasant explanation of the error is far more likely to lead to\r\namendment, than a sharp reproof, leaving hard feeling or bitterness\r\nbehind. Under no circumstances is peevishness or passion justifiable.\r\nLibrary assistants in their bearing toward each other, should suppress\r\nall feelings of censoriousness, fault-finding or jealousy, if they have\r\nthem, in favor of civility and good manners, if not of good fellowship.\r\nThey are all public servants engaged in a common cause, aiming at the\r\nenlightenment and improvement of the community; they should cherish a\r\njust pride in being selected for this great service, and to help one\r\nanother in every step of the work, should be their golden rule.\r\nEverything should be done for the success and usefulness of the library,\r\nand all personal considerations should be merged in public ones.\r\n\r\nTurning now to what remains of suggestion regarding the qualities which\r\nshould enter into the character, or form a part of the equipment of a\r\nlibrarian, let me urge the importance of his possessing a truly liberal\r\nand impartial mind. It is due to all who frequent a public library to\r\nfind all those in charge ready and willing to aid their researches in\r\nwhatever direction they may lie. Their attitude should be one of constant\r\nand sincere open-mindedness. They are to remember that it is the function\r\nof the library to supply the writings of all kinds of authors, on all\r\nsides of all questions. In doing this, it is no part of a librarian's\r\nfunction to interpose any judgments of his own upon the authors asked\r\nfor. He has no right as a librarian to be an advocate of any theories, or\r\na propagandist of any opinions. His attitude should be one of strict and\r\nabsolute impartiality. A public library is the one common property of\r\nall, the one neutral ground where all varieties of character, and all\r\nschools of opinion meet and mingle. Within its hallowed precincts, sacred\r\nto literature and science, the voice of controversy should be hushed.\r\nWhile the librarian may and should hold his own private opinions with\r\nfirmness and entire independence, he should keep them private--as regards\r\nthe frequenters of the library. He may, for example, be profoundly\r\nconvinced of the truth of the Christian religion; and he is called on, we\r\nwill suppose, for books attacking Christianity, like Thomas Paine's \"Age\r\nof Reason,\" or Robert G. Ingersoll's lectures on \"Myth and Miracle.\" It\r\nis his simple duty to supply the writers asked for, without comment, for\r\nin a public library, Christian and Jew, Mahometan and Agnostic, stand on\r\nthe same level of absolute equality. The library has the Koran, and the\r\nBook of Mormon, as well as the Scriptures of the Old and New Testament,\r\nand one is to be as freely supplied as the other. A library is an\r\ninstitution of universal range--of encyclopaedic knowledge, which gathers\r\nin and dispenses to all comers, the various and conflicting opinions of\r\nall writers upon religion, science, politics, philosophy, and sociology.\r\nThe librarian may chance to be an ardent Republican or a zealous\r\nDemocrat; but in either case, he should show as much alacrity in\r\nfurnishing readers with W. J. Bryan's book \"The First Battle,\" as with\r\nMcKinley's speeches, or the Republican Hand-Book. A library is no place\r\nfor dogmatism; the librarian is pledged, by the very nature of his\r\nprofession, which is that of a dispenser of all knowledge--not of a part\r\nof it--to entire liberality, and absolute impartiality. Remembering the\r\naxiom that all errors may be safely tolerated, while reason is left free\r\nto combat them, he should be ever ready to furnish out of the\r\nintellectual arsenal under his charge, the best and strongest weapons to\r\neither side in any conflict of opinion.\r\n\r\nIt will have been gathered from what has gone before, in recapitulation\r\nof the duties and responsibilities of the librarian's calling, that it is\r\none demanding a high order of talent. The business of successfully\r\nconducting a public library is complex and difficult. It is full of\r\nnever-ending detail, and the work accomplished does not show for what it\r\nis really worth, except in the eyes of the more thoughtful and discerning\r\nobservers.\r\n\r\nI may here bring into view some of the drawbacks and discouragements\r\nincident to the librarian's vocation, together with an outline of the\r\nadvantages which belong to it.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, there is little money in it. No one who looks upon\r\nthe acquisition of money as one of the chief aims of life, should think\r\nfor a moment of entering on a librarian's career. The prizes in the\r\nprofession are few--so few indeed, as to be quite out of the question for\r\nmost aspirants. The salaries paid in subordinate positions are very low\r\nin most libraries, and even those of head-librarians are not such that\r\none can lay up money on them. A lady assistant librarian in one city said\r\nshe had found that one of a librarian's proper qualifications was to be\r\nable to live on two meals a day. This doubtless was a humorous\r\nexaggeration, but it is true that the average salaries hitherto paid in\r\nour public libraries, with few exceptions, do not quite come up to those\r\nof public school teachers, taking the various grades into account. Most\r\nof the newly formed libraries are poor, and have to be economical. But\r\nthere is some reason to hope that as libraries multiply and their\r\nunspeakable advantages become more fully appreciated, the standard of\r\ncompensation for all skilled librarians will rise. I say skilled, because\r\ntraining and experience are the leading elements which command the better\r\nsalaries, in this, as in other professions.\r\n\r\nAnother drawback to be recognized in the librarian's calling, is that\r\nthere are peculiar trials and vexations connected with it. There are\r\nalmost no limits to the demands made upon the knowledge and the time of\r\nthe librarian. In other professions, teaching for example, there are\r\nprescribed and well-defined routines of the instruction to be given, and\r\nthe teacher who thoroughly masters this course, and brings the pupils\r\nthrough it creditably, has nothing to do beyond. The librarian, on the\r\nother hand, must be, as it were, a teacher of all sciences and\r\nliteratures at once. The field to be covered by the wants of readers, and\r\nthe inquiries that he is expected to answer, are literally illimitable.\r\nHe cannot rest satisfied with what he has already learned, however expert\r\nor learned he may have become; but he must keep on learning forevermore.\r\nThe new books that are continually flooding him, the new sciences or new\r\ndevelopments of old ones that arise, must be so far assimilated that he\r\ncan give some account of the scope of all of them to inquiring readers.\r\n\r\nIn the third place, there are special annoyances in the service of a\r\npublic, which includes always some inconsiderate and many ignorant\r\npersons, and these will frequently try one's patience, however angelic\r\nand forbearing. So, too, the short-comings of library assistants or\r\nassociates may often annoy him, but as all these trials have been before\r\nreferred to, it may be added that they are not peculiar to library\r\nservice, but are liable to occur in the profession of teaching or in any\r\nother.\r\n\r\nIn the next place, the peculiar variety and great number of the calls\r\nincessantly made upon the librarian's knowledge, constitute a formidable\r\ndraft upon any but the strongest brain. There is no escape from these\r\ncontinual drafts upon his nervous energy for one who has deliberately\r\nchosen to serve in a public library. And he will sometimes find, wearied\r\nas he often must be with many cares and a perfect flood of questions,\r\nthat the most welcome hour of the day is the hour of closing the\r\nlibrary.\r\n\r\nAnother of the librarian's vexations is frequently the interference with\r\nhis proper work by the library authorities. Committees or trustees to\r\noversee the management and supervise expenditures are necessary to any\r\npublic library. Sometimes they are quick-sighted and intelligent persons,\r\nand recognize the importance of letting the librarian work out everything\r\nin his own way, when once satisfied that they have got a competent head\r\nin charge. But there are sometimes men on a board of library control who\r\nare self-conceited and pragmatical, thinking that they know everything\r\nabout how a library should be managed, when in fact, they are profoundly\r\nignorant of the first rudiments of library science. Such men will\r\nsometimes overbear their fellows, who may be more intelligent, but not so\r\nself-asserting, and so manage as to overrule the best and wisest plans,\r\nor the most expedient methods, and vex the very soul of the librarian. In\r\nsuch cases the only remedy is patience and tact. Some day, what has been\r\ndecided wrongly may be reversed, or what has been denied the librarian\r\nmay be granted, through the conversion of a minority of the trustees into\r\na majority, by the gentle suasion and skilful reasoning of the librarian.\r\n\r\nThere are other drawbacks and discomforts in the course of a librarian's\r\nduties which have been referred to in dealing with the daily work under\r\nhis charge. There remains the fact that the profession is no bed of\r\nroses, but a laborious and exacting calling, the price of success in\r\nwhich is an unremitting industry, and energy inexhaustible. But these\r\nwill not appear very formidable requisites to those who have a native\r\nlove of work, and it is a fact not to be doubted that work of some kind\r\nis the only salvation of every human creature.\r\n\r\nUpon the whole, if the calling of the librarian involves many trials and\r\nvexations, it has also many notable compensations. Foremost among these\r\nis to be reckoned the fact that it opens more and wider avenues to\r\nintellectual culture than any other profession whatever. This comes in a\r\ntwo-fold way: first, through the stimulus to research given by the\r\nincessant inquiries of readers, and by the very necessity of his being,\r\nas a librarian; and secondly, by the rare facilities for investigation\r\nand improvement supplied by the ample and varied stores of the library\r\nalways immediately at hand. Other scholars can commonly command but few\r\nbooks, unless able to possess a large private library: their researches\r\nin the public one are hampered by the rule that no works of reference can\r\nbe withdrawn, and that constitutes a very large and essential class,\r\nconstantly needed by every scholar and writer. The librarian, on the\r\nother hand, has them all at his elbow.\r\n\r\nIn the next place, there are few professions which are in themselves so\r\nattractive as librarianship. Its tendency is both to absorb and to\r\nsatisfy the intellectual faculties. No where else is the sense of\r\ncontinual growth so palpable; in no other field of labor is such an\r\nenlargement of the bounds of one's horizon likely to be found. Compare it\r\nwith the profession of teaching. In that, the mind is chained down to a\r\nrigorous course of imparting instruction in a narrow and limited field.\r\nOne must perforce go on rehearsing the same rudiments of learning,\r\ngrinding over the same Latin gerunds, hearing the same monotonous\r\nrecitations, month after month, and year after year. This continual\r\nthreshing over of old straw has its uses, but to an ardent and active\r\nmind, it is liable to become very depressing. Such a mind would rather be\r\nkept on the _qui vive_ of activity by a volley of questions fired at him\r\nevery hour in a library, than to grind forever in an intellectual\r\ntread-mill, with no hope of change and very little of relief. The very\r\nvariety of the employments which fill up the library hours, the\r\nversatility required in the service, contributes to it a certain zest\r\nwhich other professions lack.\r\n\r\nAgain, the labors of the librarian bring him into an intimate knowledge\r\nof a wide range of books, or at least an acquaintance with authors and\r\ntitles far more extensive than can be acquired by most persons. The\r\nreading of book catalogues is a great and never-ending fascination to one\r\nwho has a love for books. The information thus acquired of the mighty\r\nrange of the world's literature and science is of inestimable value. Most\r\nof it, if retained in a retentive memory, will enable its possessor to\r\nanswer multitudes of the questions continually put to the librarian.\r\n\r\nThen, too, the service of a public library is a valuable school for the\r\nstudy of human nature. One comes in contact with scholars, men of\r\nbusiness, authors, bright young people, journalists, professional men and\r\ncultured women, to an extent unequaled by the opportunities of any other\r\ncalling. This variety of intercourse tends to broaden one's sympathies,\r\nto strengthen his powers of observation, to cultivate habits of courtesy,\r\nto develop the faculty of adapting himself to all persons--qualities\r\nwhich contribute much to social interest and success. The discipline of\r\nsuch an intercourse may sometimes make out of a silent and bashful\r\nrecluse, a ready and engaging adept in conversation, able to command the\r\nattention and conciliate the regard of all. Farther than this, one\r\nbrought into so wide a circle of communication with others, cannot fail\r\nto learn something from at least some among them, and so to receive\r\nknowledge as well as to impart it. The curious and diverse elements of\r\ncharacter brought out in such intercourse will make their impress, and\r\nmay have their value. All these many facilities for intellectual\r\nintercourse both with books and with men, contribute directly to keep\r\nthe librarian in contact with all the great objects of human interest.\r\nThey supply an unfailing stimulus to his intellectual and moral nature.\r\nThey give any active-minded person rare facilities, not only for the\r\nacquisition, but for the communication of ideas. And there is one avenue\r\nfor such communication that is peculiarly open to one whose mind is\r\nstored with the ripe fruits of reading and observation. I mean the field\r\nof authorship--not necessarily the authorship of books, but of writing in\r\nthe form of essays, reviews, lectures, stories or contributions to the\r\nperiodical press. There are in every community literary societies, clubs,\r\nand evening gatherings, where such contributions are always in demand,\r\nand always welcomed, in exact proportion to their inherent interest and\r\nvalue. Such avenues for the communication of one's thought are of great\r\nand sometimes permanent advantage. The knowledge which we acquire is\r\ncomparatively barren, until it is shared with others. And whether this be\r\nin an appreciative circle of listeners, or in the press, it gives a\r\ncertain stimulus and reward to the thinker and writer, which nothing else\r\ncan impart. To convey one's best thought to the world is one of the\r\npurest and highest of intellectual pleasures.\r\n\r\nLet me add that there are two sides to the question of authorship, as\r\nconcerns librarians. On the one hand, their advantages for entering that\r\nfield are undoubtedly superior, both from the ready command of the most\r\nabundant material, and from experience in its use. On the other hand,\r\nwhile authorship may be said to be the most besetting temptation of the\r\nlibrarian, it is one that should be steadily resisted whenever it\r\nencroaches on the time and attention due to library duties. If he makes\r\nit a rule to write nothing and to study nothing for his own objects\r\nduring library hours, he is safe. Some years since it was a common\r\nsubject of reproach regarding the librarians of several university\r\nlibraries in England that they were so engaged in writing books, that no\r\nscholar could get at them for aid in his literary researches. The\r\nlibrarians and assistants employed in the British Museum Library, where\r\nthe hours of service are short, have found time to produce numerous\r\ncontributions to literature. Witness the works, as authors and editors,\r\nof Sir Henry Ellis, Antonio Panizzi, Dr. Richard Garnett, Edward Edwards,\r\nJ. Winter Jones, Thomas Watts, George Smith, and others. And in America,\r\nthe late Justin Winsor was one of the most prolific and versatile of\r\nauthors, while John Fiske, once assistant librarian at Harvard, Reuben A.\r\nGuild, William F. Poole, George H. Moore, J. N. Larned, Frederick\r\nSaunders and others have been copious contributors to the press.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn a retrospective view of what has been said in respect to the\r\nqualifications of a librarian, it may appear that I have insisted upon\r\ntoo high a standard, and have claimed that he should be possessed of\r\nevery virtue under heaven. I freely admit that I have aimed to paint the\r\nportrait of the ideal librarian; and I have done it in order to show what\r\nmight be accomplished, rather than what has been accomplished. To set\r\none's mark high--higher even than we are likely to reach, is the surest\r\nway to attain real excellence in any vocation. It is very true that it is\r\nnot given to mortals to achieve perfection: but it is none the less our\r\nbusiness to aim at it, and the higher the ideal, the nearer we are likely\r\nto come to a notable success in the work we have chosen.\r\n\r\nLibrarianship furnishes one of the widest fields for the most eminent\r\nattainments. The librarian, more than any other person whatever, is\r\nbrought into contact with those who are hungering and thirsting after\r\nknowledge. He should be able to satisfy those longings, to lead\r\ninquirers in the way they should go, and to be to all who seek his\r\nassistance a guide, philosopher and friend. Of all the pleasures which a\r\ngenerous mind is capable of enjoying, that of aiding and enlightening\r\nothers is one of the finest and most delightful. To learn continually for\r\none's self is a noble ambition, but to learn for the sake of\r\ncommunicating to others, is a far nobler one. In fact, the librarian\r\nbecomes most widely useful by effacing himself, as it were, in seeking to\r\npromote the intelligence of the community in which he lives. One of the\r\nbest librarians in the country said that such were the privileges and\r\nopportunities of the profession, that one might well afford to live on\r\nbread and water for the sake of being a librarian, provided one had no\r\nfamily to support.\r\n\r\nThere is a new and signally marked advance in recent years, in the public\r\nidea of what constitutes a librarian. The old idea of a librarian was\r\nthat of a guardian or keeper of books--not a diffuser of knowledge, but a\r\nmere custodian of it. This idea had its origin in ages when books were\r\nfew, were printed chiefly in dead languages, and rendered still more dead\r\nby being chained to the shelves or tables of the library. The librarian\r\nmight be a monk, or a professor, or a priest, or a doctor of law, or\r\ntheology, or medicine, but in any case his function was to guard the\r\nbooks, and not to dispense them. Those who resorted to the library were\r\nkept at arm's length, as it were, and the fewer there were who came, the\r\nbetter the grim or studious custodian was pleased. Every inquiry which\r\nbroke the profound silence of the cloistered library was a kind of rude\r\ninterruption, and when it was answered, the perfunctory librarian resumed\r\nhis reading or his studies. The institution appeared to exist, not for\r\nthe benefit of the people, but for that of the librarian; or for the\r\nbenefit, besides, of a few sequestered scholars, like himself, and any\r\nwide popular use of it would have been viewed as a kind of profanation.\r\n\r\nWe have changed all that in the modern world, and library service is now\r\none of the busiest occupations in the whole range of human enterprise.\r\nOne cannot succeed in the profession, if his main idea is that a public\r\nlibrary is a nice and easy place where one may do one's own reading and\r\nwriting to the best advantage. A library is an intellectual and material\r\nwork-shop, in which there is no room for fossils nor for drones. My only\r\nconception of a useful library is a library that is used--and the same of\r\na librarian. He should be a lover of books--but not a book-worm. If his\r\ntendencies toward idealism are strong, he should hold them in check by\r\naddicting himself to steady, practical, every-day work. While careful of\r\nall details, he should not be mastered by them. If I have sometimes\r\nseemed to dwell upon trifling or obvious suggestions as to temper, or\r\nconduct, or methods, let it be remembered that trifles make up\r\nperfection, and that perfection is no trifle.\r\n\r\nI once quoted the saying that \"the librarian who reads is lost\"; but it\r\nwould be far truer to say that the librarian who does not read is lost;\r\nonly he should read wisely and with a purpose. He should make his reading\r\nhelpful in giving him a wide knowledge of facts, of thoughts, and of\r\nillustrations, which will come perpetually in play in his daily\r\nintercourse with an inquiring public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 14.\r\n\r\nSOME OF THE USES OF LIBRARIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us now consider the subject of the uses of public libraries to\r\nschools and those connected with them. Most town and city libraries are\r\nsupported, like the free schools, by the public money, drawn from the\r\ntax-payers, and supposed to be expended for the common benefit of all the\r\npeople. It results that one leading object of the library should be to\r\nacquire such a collection of books as will be in the highest degree\r\nuseful to all. And especially should the wants of the younger generation\r\nbe cared for, since they are always not only nearly one half of the\r\ncommunity, but they are also to become the future citizens of the\r\nrepublic. What we learn in youth is likely to make a more marked and\r\nlasting impression than what we may acquire in later years. And the\r\npublic library should be viewed as the most important and necessary\r\nadjunct of the school, in the instruction and improvement of the young.\r\nEach is adapted to supply what the other lacks. The school supplies oral\r\ninstruction and public exercises in various departments of learning; but\r\nit has few or no books, beyond the class text-books which are used in\r\nthese instructions. The library, on the other hand, is a silent school of\r\nlearning, free to all, and supplying a wide range of information, in\r\nbooks adapted to every age. It thus supplements, and in proportion to the\r\nextent and judicious choice of its collections, helps to complete that\r\neducation, which the school falls short of. In this view, we see the\r\ngreat importance of making sure that the public library has not only a\r\nfull supply of the best books in every field, avoiding (as previously\r\nurged) the bad or the inferior ones, but also that it has the best\r\njuvenile and elementary literature in ample supply. This subject of\r\nreading for the young has of late years come into unprecedented\r\nprominence. Formerly, and even up to the middle of our century, very\r\nslight attention was paid to it, either by authors or readers. Whole\r\ngenerations had been brought up on the New England Primer, with its\r\ngrotesque wood-cuts, and antique theology in prose and verse, with a few\r\nmoral narratives in addition, as solemn as a meeting-house, like the\r\n\"Dairyman's Daughter,\" the \"History of Sandford and Merton,\" or \"The\r\nShepherd of Salisbury Plain.\" Very dreary and melancholy do such books\r\nappear to the frequenters of our modern libraries, filled as they now are\r\nwith thousands of volumes of lively and entertaining juvenile books.\r\n\r\nThe transition from the old to the new in this class of literature was\r\nthrough the Sunday-school and religious tract society books, professedly\r\nadapted to the young. While some of these had enough of interest to be\r\nfairly readable, if one had no other resource, the mass were irredeemably\r\nstale and poor. The mawkishness of the sentiment was only surpassed by\r\nthe feebleness of the style. At last, weary of the goody-goody and\r\nartificial school of juvenile books, which had been produced for\r\ngenerations, until a surfeit of it led to something like a nausea in the\r\npublic mind, there came a new type of writers for the young, who at least\r\nbegan to speak the language of reason. The dry bones took on some\r\nsemblance of life and of human nature, and boys and girls were painted as\r\nreal boys and genuine girls, instead of lifeless dolls and manikins. The\r\nreformation went on, until we now have a world of books for the young to\r\nchoose from, very many of which are fresh and entertaining.\r\n\r\nBut the very wealth and redundancy of such literature is a new\r\nembarrassment to the librarian, who must indispensably make a selection,\r\nsince no library can have or ought to have it all. Recurring to the\r\nfunction of the public library as the coadjutor of the school, let us see\r\nwhat classes of books should form essential parts of its stores.\r\n\r\n1. As geography, or an account of the earth on which we live, is a\r\nfundamental part of education, the library should possess a liberal\r\nselection of the best books in that science. The latest general gazetteer\r\nof the world, the best modern and a good ancient atlas, one or more of\r\nthe great general collections of voyages, a set of Baedeker's admirable\r\nand inexpensive guide books, and descriptive works or travels in nearly\r\nall countries--those in America and Europe predominating--should be\r\nsecured. The scholars of all grades will thus be able to supplement their\r\nstudies by ready reference, and every part of the globe will lie open\r\nbefore them, as it were, by the aid of the library.\r\n\r\n2. The best and latest text-books in all the sciences, as geology,\r\nchemistry, natural history, physics, botany, agriculture, mechanic arts,\r\nmathematics, mental and moral science, architecture, fine arts, music,\r\nsociology, political science, etc., should be accessible.\r\n\r\n3. Every important history, with all the latest manuals or elementary\r\nbooks in general and national history should be found.\r\n\r\n4. The great collections of biography, with separate lives of all noted\r\ncharacters, should be provided.\r\n\r\n5. Dictionaries, cyclopaedias, statistical annuals, and other books of\r\nreference will be needed in abundance.\r\n\r\n6. A small but select number of approved works in law, medicine, and\r\ntheology should be embraced in the library.\r\n\r\n7. I need not add that the poets and novelists should be well\r\nrepresented, as that goes without saying in all popular libraries.\r\n\r\nAnd special attention should be paid to building up a collection of the\r\nbest books for juvenile readers, such as have passed the ordeal of good\r\ncritical judgment among the librarians, as eminently fit to be read.\r\nThere are several useful catalogues of such reading, as: Caroline M.\r\nHewins' \"Books for the Young,\" G. E. Hardy's \"Five Hundred Books for the\r\nYoung,\" and the admirable \"List of Books for Girls and Women\" by Augusta\r\nH. Leypoldt and Geo. Iles, contributed to by many experts, and copiously\r\nsupplied with notes describing the scope and quality of the books. The\r\nlast two are published by the Library Bureau.\r\n\r\nWith this broad equipment of the best books in every field, and vigilance\r\nin constant exercise to add fresh stores from the constantly appearing\r\nand often improved text-books in every science, the library will be a\r\ntreasury of knowledge both for teachers and pupils in the schools. And\r\nthe fact should not be overlooked, that there will be found as much\r\ngrowth for teachers as for scholars in such a collection of books. Very\r\nfew teachers, save those of well-furnished minds and of much careful\r\nreading, are competent to guide their scholars into the highways and\r\nbyways of knowledge, as the librarian should be able to do.\r\n\r\nTo establish a relation of confidence and aid with teachers is the\r\npreliminary step to be taken in order to make the library at once\r\npractically useful to them and to their scholars. In case there are\r\nseveral public schools in charge of a general superintendent, that\r\nofficer should be first consulted, and tendered the free aid of the\r\nlibrary and its librarian for himself and the teachers. In some public\r\nlibraries, the school superintendent is made an _ex officio_ member of\r\nthe library board. Then suitable regulations should be mutually agreed\r\nupon, fixing the number of books to be drawn on account of the schools at\r\nany one time, and the period of return to the library. It is most usual\r\nto charge such books on teachers' cards, or account, to fix\r\nresponsibility, although the teachers loan them to the scholars at their\r\noption.\r\n\r\nIn places where there are no school libraries proper, the public library\r\nwill need to provide a goodly number of duplicates, in order to meet the\r\nspecial school demand. This, however, will usually be of low-priced\r\nrather than costly books, as the elementary text-books do not draw\r\nheavily upon library funds.\r\n\r\nA very attractive feature in providing books for the young is the large\r\nnumber of illustrated books now available to all libraries. All the\r\nkingdoms of nature are depicted in these introductory manuals of science,\r\nrendering its pursuit more interesting, and cultivating the habits of\r\nobservation of form and of proportion, in the minds of the young. Pupils\r\nwho have never accomplished anything in school have been roused by\r\ninterest in illustrated natural histories to take an eager interest in\r\nlearning all about birds and animals. This always leads on and up to\r\nother study, since the mind that is once awakened to observation and to\r\nthought, needs only a slight guidance to develop an unappeasable hunger\r\nfor finding out all about things.\r\n\r\nThe ancient maxim that \"it is only the first step that costs\" is\r\nespecially true in the great art of education. It matters little what it\r\nis that first awakens the intellect--the great fact is that it is\r\nawakened, and sleeps no more thenceforward. A mottled bird's egg, found\r\non the way to school, excites the little finder to ascertain the name of\r\nthe bird that laid it. The school or the teacher supplies no means of\r\nfinding out, but the public library has books upon birds, with colored\r\nplates of their eggs, and an eager search ensues, until the young student\r\nis rewarded by finding the very bird, with its name, plumage, habits,\r\nsize, and season, all described. That child has taken an enormous step\r\nforward on the road to knowledge, which will never be forgotten.\r\n\r\nInstances might be multiplied indefinitely of such valuable aids to\r\nresearch, afforded by libraries, all along the innumerable roads\r\ntravelled by students of every age in search of information. One of the\r\nmost profitable of school exercises is to take up successively the great\r\nmen and notable women of the past, and, by the effective and practical\r\naid of the libraries, to find out what is best worth knowing about\r\nColumbus, Franklin, Walter Scott, Irving, Prescott, Bancroft, Longfellow,\r\nHawthorne, Whittier, Emerson, Lowell, Victor Hugo, or others too numerous\r\nto name. Reading Longfellow's Evangeline will lead one to search out the\r\nhistory and geography of Acadia, and so fix indelibly the practical facts\r\nconcerned, as well as the imagery of a fine poem. So in the notable\r\nevents of history, if a study is made of the English Commonwealth, or the\r\nFrench Revolution, or the war between the United States and England in\r\n1812-15, the library will supply the student with copious materials for\r\nillustration.\r\n\r\nNot alone in the fields of science, history, and biography, but in the\r\nattractive fields of literature, also, can the libraries aid and\r\nsupplement the teachings of the school. A fine poem, or a simple,\r\nhumorous, or pathetic story, told with artless grace or notable literary\r\nskill, when read aloud by a teacher in school, awakens a desire in many\r\nto have the same book at home to read, re-read, and perhaps commit to\r\nmemory the finer passages. What more inspiring or pleasing reading than\r\nsome of Longfellow's poems, or the Vicar of Wakefield, or Milton's\r\nL'Allegro and Il Penseroso, or Saintine's Picciola, or selections from\r\nthe poems of Holmes, Whittier, Kipling, or Lowell? For all these and\r\nsimilar wants, the library has an unfailing supply.\r\n\r\nAs a practical illustration of the extensive, use of books by schools in\r\nsome advanced communities, I may note that Librarian Green, of the\r\nWorcester (Mass.) Public Library, said in 1891 that his average daily\r\naccount of the books loaned to schools in two busy winter months showed\r\nover 1,600 volumes thus in daily use. This too, was in addition to all\r\nthat were drawn out by pupils on their own independent cards as\r\nborrowers. Such a record speaks volumes.\r\n\r\nIn the same city, where the Massachusetts State Normal School is located,\r\nsixty-four per cent. of the scholars visited the library to look up\r\nsubjects connected with their studies.\r\n\r\nA forcible argument for librarians taking an interest in reading for\r\nschools is that both parents and teachers often neglect to see that the\r\nyoung get only proper books to read. The children are themselves quite\r\nignorant what to choose, and if left to themselves, are likely to choose\r\nunwisely, and to read story papers or quite unimproving books. Their\r\nparents, busied as they are, commonly give no thought to the matter, and\r\nare quite destitute of that knowledge of the various classes of books\r\nwhich it is the province of the librarian to know and to discriminate.\r\nTeachers themselves do not possess this special knowledge, except in rare\r\ninstances, and have to become far more conversant with libraries than is\r\nusual, in order to acquire it.\r\n\r\nThat the very young, left to themselves, will choose many bad or\r\nworthless books is shown in the account of a principal of a school in San\r\nFrancisco, who found that sixty per cent. of the books drawn from the\r\npublic library by pupils had been dime novels, or other worthless\r\nliterature. The wide prevalence of the dime novel evil appeared in the\r\nreport of the reading of 1,000 boys in a western New York city. Out of\r\nthis number, 472 (or nearly one-half) were in the habit of devouring this\r\npernicious trash, procured in most cases by purchase at the news stands.\r\nThe matter was taken up by teachers, and, by wise direction and by aid of\r\nthe public library, the reading of these youthful candidates for\r\ncitizenship was led into more improving fields. To lead a mind in the\r\nformative stage from the low to the high, from tales of wild adventure to\r\nthe best stories for the young, is by no means difficult. Take a book\r\nthat you know is wholesome and entertaining, and it will be eagerly read\r\nby almost every one. There is an endless variety of good books adapted to\r\nthe most rudimentary capacity. Even young minds can become interested in\r\nthe works of standard writers, if the proper selection is made. Wonderful\r\nis the stimulus which the reading of a purely written, fascinating book\r\ngives to the young mind. It opens the way for more books and for infinite\r\ngrowth. All that is needed is to set the youth in the right direction,\r\nand he will go forward with rapid strides of his own accord. This\r\nteaching how to read is really the most profitable part of any education.\r\nTo recite endless lessons is not education: and one book eagerly read\r\nthrough, has often proved more valuable than all the text-books that ever\r\nwere printed.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE USES OF THE LIBRARY TO THE UNIVERSITY.\r\n\r\nClosely allied to the benefits derived from the library by the teachers\r\nand scholars in public schools are its uses to all those engaged in the\r\npursuit of higher education. For our colleges and universities and their\r\nresearches, the library must have all that we have suggested as important\r\nfor the schools, and a great deal more. The term university implies an\r\neducation as broad as the whole world of books can supply: yet we must\r\nhere meet with limitations that are inevitable. In this country we have\r\nto regret the application of the word \"university\" to institutions where\r\nthe training is only academical, or at the highest, collegiate. The\r\nuniversity, properly speaking, is an institution for the most advanced\r\nscholars or graduates of our colleges. Just as the college takes up and\r\ncarries forward the training of those who have been through the academy,\r\nthe seminary, or the high school, so it is the function of the university\r\nto carry forward (we will not say complete) the education of the graduate\r\nof the college. No education is ever completed: the doctor who has\r\nreceived the highest honors at the university has only begun his\r\neducation--for that is to go on through life--and who knows how far\r\nbeyond?\r\n\r\nNow the aid which a well equipped library can furnish to all these higher\r\ninstitutions of learning, the academy, the seminary, the college, and the\r\nuniversity, is quite incalculable. Their students are constantly engaged\r\nupon themes which not only demand the text-books they study, but\r\ncollateral illustrations almost without number. The professors, too, who\r\nimpart instruction, perpetually need to be instructed themselves, with\r\nfuller knowledge upon the themes they are daily called upon to elucidate.\r\nThere is no text-book that can teach all, or anywhere near all there is\r\nupon the subject it professes to cover. So the library, which has many\r\nbooks upon that subject, comes in to supply its deficiencies. And the\r\nlibrarian is useful to the professors and students just in proportion as\r\nhe knows, not the contents, but the range of books upon each subject\r\nsought to be investigated. Here is where the subject catalogue, or the\r\ndictionary catalogue, combining the subjects and the authors under a\r\nsingle alphabet, comes into play. But, as no catalogue of subjects was\r\never yet up to date in any considerable library, the librarian should be\r\nable to supplement the catalogue by his own knowledge of later works in\r\nany line of inquiry.\r\n\r\nThe most profitable studies carried on in libraries are, beyond all\r\nquestion, what we may term topical researches. To pursue one subject\r\nthough many authorities is the true way to arrive at comprehensive\r\nknowledge. And in this kind of research, the librarian ought to be better\r\nequipped than any who frequent his library. Why? Simply because his\r\nbusiness is bibliography; which is not the business of learned\r\nprofessors, or other scholars who visit the library.\r\n\r\nThe late Librarian Winsor said that he considered the librarian's\r\ninstruction far more valuable than that of the specialist. And this may\r\nbe owing largely to the point of view, as well as to the training, of\r\neach. The specialist, perhaps, is an enthusiast or a devotee to his\r\nscience, and so apt to give undue importance to the details of it, or to\r\nmagnify some one feature: the librarian, on the other hand, who is\r\nnothing if not comprehensive, takes the larger view of the wide field of\r\nliterature on each subject, and his suggestions concerning sources of\r\ninformation are correspondingly valuable.\r\n\r\nIn those constantly arising questions which form the subjects of essays\r\nor discussions in all institutions of learning, the well-furnished\r\nlibrary is an unfailing resource. The student who finds his unaided mind\r\nalmost a blank upon the topic given out for treatment, resorts at once to\r\nthe public library, searches catalogues, questions the librarian, and\r\nsurrounds himself with books and periodicals which may throw light upon\r\nit. He is soon master of facts and reasonings which enable him to start\r\nupon a train of thought that bears fruit in an essay or discourse. In\r\nfact, it may be laid down as an axiom, that nearly every new book that is\r\nwritten is indebted to the library for most of its ideas, its facts, or\r\nits illustrations, so that libraries actually beget libraries.\r\n\r\nSome of the endlessly diversified uses of a well-equipped library, not\r\nonly to scholars but to the general public, may here be referred to.\r\nAmong the most sought for sources of information, the periodical press,\r\nboth of the past and the current time, holds a prominent rank. When it is\r\nconsidered how far-reaching are the fields embraced in the wide range of\r\nthese periodicals, literary, religious, scientific, political, technical,\r\nphilosophical, social, medical, legal, educational, agricultural,\r\nbibliographical, commercial, financial, historical, mechanical, nautical,\r\nmilitary, artistic, musical, dramatic, typographical, sanitary, sporting,\r\neconomic, and miscellaneous, is it any wonder that specialists and\r\nwriters for the press seek and find ready aid therein for their\r\nmany-sided labors?\r\n\r\nTo the skeptical mind, accustomed to undervalue what does not happen to\r\ncome within the range of his pet idols or pursuits, the observation of a\r\nsingle day's multifold research in a great library might be in the nature\r\nof a revelation. Hither flock the ever-present searchers into family\r\nhistory, laying under contribution all the genealogies and town and\r\ncounty histories which the country has produced. Here one finds an\r\nindustrious compiler intent upon the history of American duels, for which\r\nthe many files of Northern and Southern newspapers, reaching back to the\r\nbeginning of the century, afford copious material. At another table sits\r\na deputation from a government department, commissioned to make a record\r\nof all notable strikes and labor troubles for a series of years, to be\r\ngleaned from the columns of the journals of leading cities.\r\n\r\nAn absorbed reader of French romances sits side by side with a clergyman\r\nperusing homilies, or endeavoring to elucidate, through a mass of\r\ncommentators, a special text. Here are to be found ladies in pursuit of\r\ncostumes of every age; artists turning over the great folio galleries of\r\nEurope for models or suggestions; lawyers seeking precedents or leading\r\ncases; journalists verifying dates, speeches, conventions, or other\r\nforgotten facts; engineers studying the literature of railways or\r\nmachinery; actors or amateurs in search of plays or works on the dramatic\r\nart; physicians looking up biographies of their profession or the history\r\nof epidemics; students of heraldry after coats of arms; inventors\r\nsearching the specifications and drawings of patents; historical students\r\npursuing some special field in American or foreign annals; scientists\r\nverifying facts or citations by original authorities; searchers tracing\r\npersonal residences or deaths in old directories or newspapers; querists\r\nseeking for the words of some half-remembered passage in poetry or prose,\r\nor the original author of one of the myriad proverbs which have no\r\nfather; architects or builders of houses comparing hundreds of designs\r\nand models; teachers perusing works on education or comparing text-books\r\nnew or old; readers absorbing the great poems of the world; writers in\r\npursuit of new or curious themes among books of antiquities or folk-lore;\r\nstudents of all the questions of finance and economic science;\r\nnaturalists seeking to trace through many volumes descriptions of\r\nspecies; pursuers of military or naval history or science; enthusiasts\r\nventuring into the occult domains of spiritualism or thaumaturgy;\r\nexplorers of voyages and travels in every region of the globe; fair\r\nreaders, with dreamy eyes, devouring the last psychological novel;\r\ndevotees of musical art perusing the lives or the scores of great\r\ncomposers; college and high-school students intent upon \"booking up\" on\r\nthemes of study or composition or debate; and a host of other seekers\r\nafter suggestion or information in a library of encyclopedic range.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 15.\r\n\r\nTHE HISTORY OF LIBRARIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Library, from very early times, has enlisted the enthusiasm of the\r\nlearned, and the encomiums of the wise. The actual origin of the earliest\r\ncollection of books (or rather of manuscripts) is lost in the mists of\r\nremote antiquity. Notwithstanding professed descriptions of several\r\nlibraries found in Aulus Gellius, Athenaeus, and others, who wrote\r\ncenturies after the alleged collections were made, we lack the convincing\r\nevidence of eye-witnesses and contemporaries. But so far as critical\r\nresearch has run, the earliest monuments of man which approached\r\ncollections of written records are found not in Europe, but in Africa and\r\nAsia.\r\n\r\nThat land of wonders, Egypt, abounds in hieroglyphic inscriptions, going\r\nback, as is agreed by modern scholars, to the year 2000 before the\r\nChristian era. A Papyrus manuscript, too, exists, which is assigned to\r\nabout 1600 B. C. And the earliest recorded collection of books in the\r\nworld, though perhaps not the first that existed, was that of the\r\nEgyptian king Ramses I.--B. C. 1400, near Thebes, which Diodorus Siculus\r\nsays bore the inscription \"Dispensary of the soul.\" Thus early were books\r\nregarded as remedial agents of great force and virtue.\r\n\r\nBut before the library of Ramses the Egyptian king, there existed in\r\nBabylonia collections of books, written not on parchment, nor on the more\r\nperishable papyrus, but on clay. Whole poems, fables, laws, and hymns of\r\nthe gods have been found, stamped in small characters upon baked bricks.\r\nThese clay tablets or books were arranged in numerical order, and the\r\nlibrary at Agane, which existed about 2000 B. C. even had a catalogue, in\r\nwhich each piece of literature was numbered, so that readers had only to\r\nwrite down the number of the tablet wanted, and the librarian would hand\r\nit over. Two of these curious poems in clay have been found intact, one\r\non the deluge, the other on the descent of Istar into Hades.\r\n\r\nThe next ancient library in point of time yet known to us was gathered in\r\nAsia by an Assyrian King, and this collection has actually come down to\r\nus, _in propria persona_. Buried beneath the earth for centuries, the\r\narchaeologist Layard discovered in 1850 at Nineveh, an extensive\r\ncollection of tablets or tiles of clay, covered with cuneiform\r\ncharacters, and representing some ten thousand distinct works or\r\ndocuments. The Assyrian monarch Sardanapalus, a great patron of letters,\r\nwas the collector of this primitive and curious library of clay. He\r\nflourished about 1650 B. C.\r\n\r\nIn Greece, where a copious and magnificent literature had grown up\r\ncenturies before Christ, Pisistratus collected a library at Athens, and\r\ndied B. C. 527. When Xerxes captured Athens, this collection, which\r\nrepresents the earliest record of a library dedicated to the public, was\r\ncarried off to Persia, but restored two centuries later. The renowned\r\nphilosopher Aristotle gathered one of the largest Greek libraries, about\r\n350 B. C. said to have embraced about 1400 volumes, or rather, rolls.\r\nPlato called Aristotle's residence \"the house of the reader.\" This\r\nlibrary, also, was carried off to Scepsis, and later by the victorious\r\nSulla to Rome. History shows that the Greek collections were the earliest\r\n\"travelling libraries\" on record, though they went as the spoils of war,\r\nand not to spread abroad learning by the arts of peace.\r\n\r\nRome having conquered Athens, we hear no more of the Athenian libraries,\r\nbut the seat of ancient learning was transferred to Alexandria, where\r\nwere gathered under the liberal sway of the Ptolemies, more books than\r\nhad ever been assembled together in any part of the world. Marc Antony\r\npresented to Cleopatra the library of the Kings of Pergamus, said to have\r\ncontained 200,000 rolls. There is no space to sketch the ancient\r\nlibraries, so scantily commemorated, of Greece. Through Aristotle's\r\nenthusiasm for learning, as it is believed, the Ptolemies were fired with\r\nthe zeal of book-collecting, and their capital of Alexandria became the\r\nseat of extensive libraries, stored in the Brucheion and the Serapeum.\r\nHere, according to general belief, occurred the burning of the famous\r\nAlexandrian library of 700,000 volumes, by the Saracens under Omar, A. D.\r\n640. If any one would have an object lesson in the uncertainties of\r\nhistory and of human testimony, let him read the various conflicting\r\naccounts of the writers who have treated upon this subject. The number of\r\nvolumes varies from 700,000, as stated by Aulus Gellius, to 100,000 by\r\nEusebius. The fact that in ancient times each book or division of an\r\nauthor's work written on a roll of papyrus was reckoned as a volume, may\r\naccount for the exaggeration, since the nine books of Herodotus would\r\nthus make nine volumes, and the twenty-four of Homer's Iliad, twenty-four\r\nvolumes, instead of one. So, by an arbitrary application of averages, the\r\nsize of the Alexandrian Library might be brought within reasonable\r\ndimensions, though there is nothing more misleading than the doctrine of\r\naverages, unless indeed it be a false analogy. But that any library eight\r\nhundred years before the invention of printing contained 700,000 volumes\r\nin the modern sense of the word, when the largest collection in the\r\nworld, three centuries after books began to be multiplied by types, held\r\nless than 100,000 volumes, is one of the wildest fictions which writers\r\nhave imposed upon the credulity of ages.\r\n\r\nI cannot even touch upon the libraries of the Romans, though we have very\r\nattractive accounts, among others, of the literary riches of Lucullus, of\r\nAtticus, and of Cicero. The first library in Rome was founded 167 B. C.\r\nand in the Augustan age they multiplied, until there were twenty-nine\r\npublic libraries in Hadrian's time, 120 A. D. The emperor Julian, in the\r\nfourth century, was a founder of libraries, and is said to have placed\r\nover the doors this inscription: \"_Alii quidem equos amant, alii oves,\r\nalii feros; mihi vero a puerulo mirandum acquirendi et possidendi libros\r\ninsedit desiderium._\"\r\n\r\nThe libraries of the middle ages were neither large nor numerous. The\r\nneglect of learning and of literature was wide-spread; only in the\r\nmonasteries of Europe were to be found scholars who kept alive the sacred\r\nflame. In these were renewed those fruitful labors of the _scriptorium_\r\nwhich had preserved and multiplied so many precious books in classic\r\ntimes among the Romans. The monks, indeed, were not seldom creators as\r\nwell as copyists, though the works which they composed were mainly\r\ntheological (as became their sacred profession and ascetic life). The\r\nLatin, however, being the almost universal language for so many\r\ncenturies, the love of learning conspired to widen the field of monastic\r\nstudy. Many zealous ecclesiastics were found who revived the classic\r\nauthors, and copies of the works of poets, historians, philosophers and\r\nrhetoricians were multiplied. Then were gradually formed those monastic\r\nlibraries to which so many thousands of mediaeval scholars owed a debt of\r\ngratitude. The order of Benedictines took a leading and effective part in\r\nthis revival of learning. Taxes were levied on the inmates of monasteries\r\nexpressly for furnishing the library with books, and the novices in many\r\nhouses must contribute writing materials upon entering, and books at the\r\nclose of their novitiate, for the enrichment of the library. Among\r\nnotably valuable libraries, several of which still survive, were those of\r\nMonte Cassino in Italy, the Abbey of Fleury in France, St. Gall in\r\nSwitzerland, and that of the illustrious congregation of St. Maur in\r\nFrance. The latter had at one time no less than one hundred and seven\r\nwriters engaged in multiplying books.\r\n\r\nThe first library in England is recorded (in the Canterbury Chartulary)\r\nto have been given by Pope Gregory the Great, and brought by St.\r\nAugustine, first Archbishop of Canterbury, on his mission to England\r\nabout A. D. 600. It consisted of nine precious volumes on vellum, being\r\ncopies of parts of the Scriptures, with commentaries, and a volume of\r\nLives of the Martyrs. The library of the Benedictine Monastery at\r\nCanterbury had grown in the 13th century to 3000 titles, being very rich\r\nin theology, but with many books also in history, poetry and science. At\r\nYork had been founded, in the 8th century, a noble library by Archbishop\r\nEgbert, and the great scholar Alcuin here acquired, amidst that \"infinite\r\nnumber of excellent books,\" his life-long devotion to literature. When he\r\nremoved to Tours, in France, he lamented the loss of the literary\r\ntreasures of York, in a poem composed of excellent hexameters. He begged\r\nof Charlemagne to send into Britain to procure books, \"that the garden of\r\nparadise may not be confined to York.\"\r\n\r\nFine libraries were also gathered at the monasteries of Durham, of\r\nGlastonbury, and of Croyland, and at the Abbeys of Whitby and\r\nPeterborough.\r\n\r\nNor were the orders of Franciscans and Dominicans far behind as\r\nbook-collectors, though they commonly preferred to buy rather than to\r\ntranscribe manuscripts, like the Benedictines. \"In every convent of\r\nfriars,\" wrote Fitzralph to the Pope, in 1350, \"there is a large and\r\nnoble library.\" And Richard de Bury, Bishop of Durham, and Chancellor of\r\nEngland in 1334, whose \"Philobiblon\" is the most eloquent treatise in\r\npraise of books ever written, said, when visiting places where the\r\nmendicants had convents; \"there amid the deepest poverty, we found the\r\nmost precious riches stored up.\" The Pope, it appears, relaxed for these\r\norders the rigor of their vows of poverty, in favor of amassing\r\nbooks--mindful, doubtless, of that saying of Solomon the wise--\"Therefore\r\nget wisdom, because it is better than gold.\"\r\n\r\nRichard de Bury, the enthusiast of learning, wrote thus:\r\n\r\n\"The library, therefore, of wisdom is more precious than all riches, and\r\nnothing that can be wished for is worthy to be compared with it.\r\nWhosoever, therefore, acknowledges himself to be a zealous follower of\r\nthe truth, of happiness, of wisdom, of science, or even of the faith,\r\nmust of necessity make himself a lover of books.\"\r\n\r\nAnd said Joseph Hall, Bishop of Norwich--\"I can wonder at nothing more\r\nthan how a man can be idle--but of all others a scholar; in so many\r\nimprovements of reason, in such sweetness of knowledge, in such variety\r\nof studies, in such importunity of thoughts. To find wit in poetry; in\r\nphilosophy profoundness; in history wonder of events; in oratory, sweet\r\neloquence; in divinity, supernatural light and holy devotion--whom would\r\nit not ravish with delight?\"\r\n\r\nCharles the Fifth of France amassed a fine library, afterwards sold to an\r\nEnglish nobleman. Lorenzo de Medici, of Hungary, and Frederic Duke of\r\nUrbino, each gathered in the 15th century a magnificent collection of\r\nbooks. All of these became widely dispersed in later years, though the\r\nmanuscripts of the Duke of Urbino's collection are preserved in the\r\nlibrary of the Vatican.\r\n\r\nI may here note a very few of the most extensive library collections now\r\nexisting in Europe and America.\r\n\r\n1. Of the great public libraries of Europe, which owe much of their\r\nriches to the government privilege of the copy-tax, the national library\r\nof France is the oldest and the largest, now numbering two million six\r\nhundred thousand volumes. Founded in the 15th century, it has had four\r\nhundred years of opportunity for steady and large increase. Paris abounds\r\nin other public libraries also, in which respect it is far superior to\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\n2. Next to the Bibliothèque nationale of France, comes the Library of the\r\nBritish Museum, with 2,000,000 volumes, very rich both in manuscripts and\r\nin printed books in all languages. A liberal Parliamentary grant of\r\n$60,000 a year for purchase of books and manuscripts keeps this great\r\ncollection well up to date as to all important new works, besides\r\nenabling it constantly to fill up deficiencies in the literature of the\r\npast. Following this, among the great libraries having over half a\r\nmillion books, come in numerical order\r\n\r\n                                                  Volumes.\r\n 3. Russian Imperial Library, St. Petersburg,    1,200,000\r\n 4. Royal Library of Prussia, Berlin,            1,000,000\r\n 5. Royal Library of Bavaria, Munich,              980,000\r\n 6. Library of Congress, Washington City,          840,000\r\n 7. Boston Public Library,                         734,000\r\n 8. University Library, Strasburg, Germany,        700,000\r\n 9. Imperial Public Library, Vienna,               575,000\r\n10. Bodleian Library, Oxford                       530,000\r\n\r\nIt is a notable fact that among the richest monuments of learning that\r\nhave been gathered by mankind, the University libraries hold a very high\r\nrank. Reckoned in number of volumes, there are many of them which far\r\noutrank the government libraries, except in six instances. Out of 174\r\nlibraries, all exceeding 100,000 volumes, as reported in the annual\r\n_Minerva_, in October, 1898, no less than 72 are the libraries of\r\nuniversities. Strasburg heads the list, with a noble collection of\r\n700,000 volumes; then Oxford university, whose Bodleian library numbers\r\n530,000; Leipzig university, 504,000; Cambridge university, England,\r\nGöttingen university, and Harvard university, 500,000 each; the\r\nuniversity of Vienna, 475,000; the universities of Heidelberg and of\r\nMunich, 400,000 each; Ghent and Würzburg universities, 350,000 each;\r\nChristiania, Norway, university, and Tübingen, each 340,000; University\r\nof Chicago, 330,000; Copenhagen university, 305,000; Breslau, Cracow,\r\nRostock and Upsala, 300,000 each; Yale university, New Haven, 280,000;\r\nSt. Petersburg, 257,000; Bologna, 255,000; Freiburg and Bonn\r\nuniversities, 250,000 each; Prague, 245,000; Trinity, Dublin, 232,000;\r\nKönigsberg, 231,000; Kiel, 229,000; Naples, 224,000; and Buda-Pest,\r\n210,000. I need not detain you by enumerating those that fall below\r\n200,000 volumes, but will say that the whole number of volumes in the 72\r\nuniversity libraries embraced in my table is more than fifteen millions,\r\nwhich would be much enlarged if smaller libraries were included. A noble\r\nexhibit is this, which the institutions of the highest education hold up\r\nbefore us.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe may now consider, somewhat more in detail as to particulars, the\r\norigin and growth of the libraries of the United States. The record will\r\nshow an amazingly rapid development, chiefly accomplished during the last\r\nquarter of a century, contrasted with the lamentably slow growth of\r\nearlier years.\r\n\r\nThirty years ago the present year, I was invited to give to the American\r\nSocial Science Association, then meeting at New York, a discourse upon\r\nPublic Libraries in the United States. On recurring to this address, I\r\nhave been agreeably surprised to find how completely its facts and\r\nfigures belong to the domain of ancient history. For, while it may excite\r\na smile to allude to anything belonging to a period only thirty years\r\nback as ancient history, yet, so rapid has been the accumulation, not\r\nonly of books, but of libraries themselves in that brief period of three\r\ndecades, as almost to justify the term employed.\r\n\r\nAntiquarians must ever regard with interest the first efforts for the\r\nestablishment of public libraries in the New World. The first record of\r\nbooks dedicated to a public purpose in that part of this country now\r\noccupied by the English-speaking race is, I believe, to be found in the\r\nfollowing entry in the Records of the Virginia Company of London:\r\n\r\n\"November 15, 1620.--After the Acts of the former Courte were read, a\r\nstraunger stept in presentinge a Mapp of S^r Walter Rawlighes contayinge\r\na Descripcon of Guiana, and with the same fower great books as the Guifte\r\nof one unto the Company that desyred his name might not be made knowne,\r\nwhereof one booke was a treatise of St. Augustine of the Citty of God\r\ntranslated into English, the other three greate Volumes wer the works of\r\nMr. Perkins' newlie corrected and amended, wch books the Donor desyred\r\nthey might be sent to the Colledge in Virginia there to remayne in saftie\r\nto the use of the collegiates thereafter, and not suffered at any time to\r\nbe sent abroade or used in the meane while. For wch so worthy a guifte my\r\nLord of Southampton desyred the p'tie that presented them to returne\r\ndeserued thanks from himselfe and the rest of the Company to him that had\r\nso kindly bestowed them.\"[1]\r\n\r\nThe college here referred to was the first ever founded in America, and\r\nwas seated at Henrico, at the confluence of the James River with the\r\nChickahominy. It was designed not only for the education of the Virginia\r\nsettlers, but to teach science and Christianity to the Indians. Large\r\ncontributions were raised in England by Sir Edwin Sandys, and others of\r\nthe Virginia Company, for its support. But this Virginia college and its\r\nincipient library were doomed to a speedy extinction. Like so many other\r\nbrilliant \"prospects for planting arts and learning in America,\" it did\r\nnot survive the perils of the colonial epoch. It was brought to a period\r\nby the bloody Indian massacre of March 22, 1622, when three hundred and\r\nforty-seven of the Virginia settlers were slaughtered in a day, the new\r\nsettlement broken up, and the expanding lines of civilization contracted\r\nto the neighborhood of Jamestown.\r\n\r\nHarvard University Library was founded in 1638 by the endowment of John\r\nHarvard, who bequeathed to the new college his library and half of his\r\nestate. Soon afterwards enriched by the zealous contributions of English\r\nPuritans and philosophers, of Berkeley, and Baxter, and Lightfoot, and\r\nSir Kenelm Digby, the first university library in America, after a\r\ncentury and a quarter of usefulness, was totally destroyed with the\r\ncollege edifice in the year 1764 by fire. When we contemplate the ravages\r\nof this element, which has consumed so many noble libraries, destroying\r\nnot only printed books of priceless value, but often precious manuscripts\r\nwhich are unique and irreplaceable, a lively sense of regret comes over\r\nus that these creations of the intellect, which should be imperishable,\r\nare even yet at the mercy of an accident in all the libraries of the\r\nworld save a very few. The destruction of books in private hands is\r\nnatural and inevitable enough, and goes on continually. Whole editions of\r\nbooks, now sought with avidity as the rarest volumes known to literature,\r\nhave been gradually destroyed in innumerable fires, worn out in the hands\r\nof readers, used for waste paper by grocers and petty tradesmen,\r\nswallowed up in the sack of towns, or consumed by dampness, mould, or, in\r\nrare instances, by the remorseless tooth of time. Yet there have always\r\nexisted public libraries enough, had they been fire-proof, to have\r\npreserved many copies of every book bequeathed to the world, both before\r\nthe invention of printing and since. But, when your insurance office is\r\nbankrupt, what becomes of the insured? When nearly all our public\r\nlibraries are so constructed as to become an easy prey to the flames, the\r\nloss of so many books which have completely perished from the earth\r\nceases to be wonderful.\r\n\r\nThe growth of Harvard University library, from its second foundation a\r\ncentury ago, has been steady, though at no time rapid. Select and\r\nvaluable in its principal contents, it has received numerous benefactions\r\nfrom the friends of learning, and promises to become the best, as it\r\nalready is much the largest, among the university libraries of the\r\ncountry. Its present strength is about 500,000 volumes.\r\n\r\nThe year 1700 witnessed the birth of the first New York library open to\r\npublic use. The Rev. John Sharp, then chaplain of His Majesty's forces in\r\nthat city (it was in the days of good King William of Orange), bequeathed\r\nhis private collection of books to found a \"public library\" in New York.\r\nThe library thus organized was placed in charge of the corporation of the\r\ncity, but the first city library of New York languished with little or no\r\nincrease until 1754, when a society of gentlemen undertook to found a\r\npublic library by subscription, and succeeded so well that the city\r\nauthorities turned over to them what remained of the Public City Library.\r\nThis was the beginning of the New York Society Library, one of the\r\nlargest of the proprietary libraries of the country. It was then, and for\r\na long time afterwards, commonly known as \"The City Library.\" The\r\nContinental Congress profited by its stores, there being no other library\r\nopen to their use; and the First Congress under the Constitution, which\r\nmet in New York in 1789, received the free use of the books it contained.\r\nThe library is conducted on the share system, the payment of twenty-five\r\ndollars, and an annual assessment of six dollars, giving any one the\r\nprivilege of membership. It now contains about 100,000 volumes.\r\n\r\nThe same year, 1700, in which the New York Library was founded, ten\r\nConnecticut ministers met together at Lyme, each bringing a number of\r\nbooks, and saying, \"I give these books for the founding of a college in\r\nthis colony.\" Such was the foundation of Yale University, an institution\r\nthat has done inestimable service to the cause of letters, having been\r\nfruitful of writers of books, as well as of living contributions to the\r\nranks of every learned profession. Thirty years later, we find the good\r\nBishop Berkeley pausing from the lofty speculations which absorbed him,\r\nto send over to Yale College what was called \"the finest collection of\r\nbooks that ever came together at one time into America.\" For a century\r\nand a half the growth of this library was very slow, the college being\r\noppressed with poverty. In 1869, the number of volumes had risen only to\r\n50,000, but it is cheering to relate that the last thirty years have\r\nwitnessed a growth so rapid that in 1899 Yale University Library had\r\n285,000 volumes.\r\n\r\nThe fourth considerable library founded in the United States was due in a\r\nlarge degree to the industry and zeal for knowledge of the illustrous\r\nFranklin. As unquestionably the first established proprietary library in\r\nAmerica, the Library Company of Philadelphia merits especial notice. Let\r\nus reverently take a leaf out of the autobiography of the\r\nprinter-statesman of Pennsylvania:\r\n\r\n\"And now I set on foot my first project of a public nature, that for a\r\nsubscription library. I drew up the proposals, got them put into form by\r\nour great scrivener, Brockden, and by the help of my friends in the Junto\r\n[the Junto was a club for mutual improvement, founded by Franklin]\r\nprocured fifty subscribers at forty shillings each to begin with, and ten\r\nshillings a year for fifty years, the term our company was to continue.\r\nWe afterwards obtained a charter, the company being increased to one\r\nhundred; this was the mother of all the North American subscription\r\nlibraries now so numerous. It is become a great thing itself, and\r\ncontinually increasing. These libraries have improved the general\r\nconversation of the Americans, made the common tradesmen and farmers as\r\nintelligent as most gentlemen from other countries, and perhaps have\r\ncontributed in some degree to the stand so generally made throughout the\r\ncolonies in defence of their privileges.\"\r\n\r\nWhen this Philadelphia Library was founded, in 1731, not a single city or\r\ntown in England possessed a subscription library. Even the library of the\r\nBritish Museum, since become the greatest collection of books in the\r\nworld, save one, was not opened until 1759, more than a quarter of a\r\ncentury afterwards. Although not designed as a public library of\r\ncirculation, save to its own subscribers, the Philadelphia Library has\r\nbeen kept free to all for reference and consultation. The record of the\r\ngradual increase of the first Philadelphia Library from its first few\r\nhundred volumes, when Franklin was but twenty-five years of age, to its\r\npresent rank as the largest proprietary library in America, with 195,000\r\nvolumes of books, is highly interesting. Its history, in fact, is to a\r\nlarge extent the history of intellectual culture in Philadelphia, which\r\nremained, until the second decade in the present century, the foremost\r\ncity of the Union in population, and, from 1791 to 1800, the seat of\r\ngovernment of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe Philadelphia Library Company, in 1774, voted that \"the gentlemen who\r\nwere to meet in Congress\" in that city should be furnished with such\r\nbooks as they might have occasion for; and the same privilege was\r\nexercised on the return of the Government to that city, in 1791, and\r\nuntil the removal of Congress to Washington in 1800. During the nine\r\nmonths' occupation of Philadelphia by the British army, it is refreshing\r\nto read that the conquerors lifted no spear against the Muses' bower, but\r\nthat \"the officers, without exception, left deposits, and paid hire for\r\nthe books borrowed by them.\" The collection, in respect of early printed\r\nbooks, is one of the largest and most valuable in America, embracing some\r\nbooks and files of newspapers which are to be found in no other public\r\nlibrary. The selection of new books has been kept unusually free from the\r\nmasses of novels and other ephemeral publications which overload most of\r\nour popular libraries, and the collection, although limited in extent in\r\nevery field, and purposely leaving special topics, such as the medical\r\nand natural sciences, to the scientific libraries which abound in\r\nPhiladelphia, affords to the man of letters a good working library. The\r\nshares in the library cost forty dollars, with an annual assessment of\r\nfour dollars to each stockholder.\r\n\r\nIn 1869, the great bequest of Doctor James Rush to the Philadelphia\r\nLibrary of his whole property, valued at over $1,000,000, was accepted by\r\nits stockholders, by the bare majority of five votes in a poll of over\r\nfive hundred. This lack of harmony is attributable to the fact that the\r\nbequest, so generous in itself, was hampered by the donor with numerous\r\nconditions, deemed by many friends of the library to be highly onerous\r\nand vexatious. Not the least among these was the following, which is\r\ncited from the will itself:\r\n\r\n\"Let the library not keep cushioned seats for time-wasting and lounging\r\nreaders, nor places for every-day novels, mind-tainting reviews,\r\ncontroversial politics, scribblings of poetry and prose, biographies of\r\nunknown names, nor for those teachers of disjointed thinking, the daily\r\nnewspapers.\"\r\n\r\nHere is one more melancholy instance of a broad and liberal bequest\r\nnarrowly bestowed. The spirit which animated the respectable testator in\r\nattempting to exclude the larger part of modern literature from the\r\nlibrary which his money was to benefit may have been unexceptionable\r\nenough. Doubtless there are evils connected with a public supply of\r\nfrivolous and trifling literature; and perhaps our periodicals may be\r\njustly chargeable with devoting an undue proportion of their columns to\r\ntopics of merely ephemeral interest. But it should never be forgotten\r\nthat the literature of any period is and must be largely occupied with\r\nthe questions of the day. Thus, and thus only, it becomes a\r\nrepresentative literature, and it is precious to posterity in proportion\r\nas it accurately reflects the spirit, the prejudices, and the\r\npersonalities of a time which has passed into history, leaving behind it\r\nno living representatives. If we admit that the development of the human\r\nintellect at any particular period is worth studying, then all books are,\r\nor may become, useful. It is amazing that a person with any pretensions\r\nto discernment should denounce newspapers as unfitted to form a part of a\r\npublic library. The best newspapers of the time are sometimes the best\r\nbooks of the time. A first-class daily journal is an epitome of the\r\nworld, recording the life and the deeds of men, their laws and their\r\nliterature, their politics and religion, their social and criminal\r\nstatistics, the progress of invention and of art, the revolutions of\r\nempires, and the latest results of science. Grant that newspapers are\r\nprejudiced, superficial, unfair; so also are books. Grant that the\r\njournals often give place to things scurrilous and base; but can there be\r\nanything baser or more scurrilous than are suffered to run riot in books?\r\nThere is to be found hidden away in the pages of some books such filth as\r\nno man would dare to print in a newspaper, from fear of the instant wrath\r\nof the passers-by.\r\n\r\nWhen I consider the debt which libraries and literature alike owe to the\r\ndaily and weekly press, it is difficult to characterize with patience the\r\nParthian arrow flung at it from the grave of a querulous millionaire, who\r\nwill owe to these very newspapers the greater part of his success and his\r\nreputation. The father of the respectable testator, Doctor Benjamin Rush,\r\nhas left on record many learned speculations concerning the signs and\r\nevidences of lunacy. We may now add to the number the vagaries of the\r\nauthor of a ponderous work on the human intellect, who gravely proposed\r\nto hand over to posterity an expurgated copy of the nineteenth century,\r\nwith all its newspapers left out.\r\n\r\nThe Library of Congress, or, as it was called in its first general\r\ncatalogue in 1815, \"The Library of the United States,\" was founded in\r\n1800, by the purchase of five thousand dollars' worth of books by act of\r\nCongress, upon the removal of the government to Washington. By the act of\r\nJanuary 26, 1802, entitled \"An act concerning the Library for the use of\r\nboth Houses of Congress,\" this library was placed in charge of a joint\r\ncommittee of both Houses of Congress, consisting of three Senators and\r\nthree Representatives, and a Librarian, to be appointed by the President\r\nof the United States. It had grown to the number of only 3,000 volumes in\r\n1814, when the British army made a bonfire of our national Capitol, and\r\nthe library was consumed in the ruins. The first library of Congress\r\nbeing thus destroyed, ex-President Jefferson, then living, involved in\r\ndebt, and in his old age, at Monticello, offered his fine private library\r\nof 6,700 volumes to Congress, through friends in that body, the terms of\r\npayment to be made convenient to the public, and the price to be fixed by\r\na committee. The proposition met with able advocacy and also with some\r\nwarm opposition. It is illustrative of the crude conceptions regarding\r\nthe uses of books which prevailed in the minds of some members, that the\r\nlibrary was objected to on the somewhat incongruous grounds of embracing\r\ntoo many editions of the Bible, and a number of the French writers in\r\nskeptical philosophy. It was gravely proposed to pack up this portion of\r\nthe library, and return it to the illustrious owner at Monticello, paying\r\nhim for the remainder. More enlightened counsels, however, prevailed, and\r\nthe nation became possessed, for about $23,000, of a good basis for a\r\npublic library which might become worthy of the country. The collection\r\nthus formed grew by slow accretion until, in 1851, it had accumulated\r\n55,000 volumes. On the 24th of December in that year, a defective flue\r\nin the Capitol set fire to the wood-work with which the whole library was\r\nsurrounded, and the result was a conflagration, from which 20,000 volumes\r\nonly were saved. Congress at once appropriated, with praiseworthy\r\nliberality, $75,000 for the purchase of new books, and $92,500 for\r\nrebuilding the library room in solid iron; the first instance of the\r\nemployment of that safe and permanent material, so capable of the\r\nlightest and most beautiful architectural effects, in the entire interior\r\nstructure of any public building. The appropriation of $75,000 was\r\nprincipally expended in the purchase of standard English literature,\r\nincluding complete sets of many important periodicals, and a selection of\r\nthe more costly works in science and the fine arts. In 1866, two wings,\r\neach as large as the central library, and constructed of the same\r\nfire-proof material, were added to it, and quickly filled by the\r\naccession, the same year and the following, of two large libraries, that\r\nof the Smithsonian Institution, and the historical library of Peter\r\nForce, of Washington. The latter was the largest private library ever\r\nthen brought together in the United States, but its chief value consisted\r\nin its possession of a very great proportion of the books relating to the\r\nsettlement, history, topography, and politics of America, its 45,000\r\npamphlets, its files of early newspapers of the Revolution, its early\r\nprinted books, and its rich assemblage of maps and manuscripts, many of\r\nthe latter being original autographs of the highest historical interest,\r\nincluding military letters and papers of the period of the American\r\nRevolution. The Smithsonian library, the custody of which was accepted by\r\nCongress as a trust, is rich in scientific works in all the languages of\r\nEurope, and forms an extensive and appropriate supplement to the Library\r\nof Congress, the chief strength of which lies in jurisprudence,\r\npolitical science, history, and books relating to America. Yet no\r\ndepartment of literature or science has been left unrepresented in its\r\nformation, and the fact has been kept steadily in view that the Library\r\nof the Government must become, sooner or later, a universal one. As the\r\nonly library which is entitled to the benefit of the copyright law, by\r\nwhich copies of each publication for which the Government grants an\r\nexclusive right must be deposited in the National Library, this\r\ncollection must become annually more important as an exponent of the\r\ngrowth of American literature. This wise provision of law prevents the\r\ndispersion or destruction of books that tend continually to disappear; a\r\nbenefit to the cause of letters, the full value of which it requires\r\nslight reflection to estimate.\r\n\r\nThis National Library now embraces 840,000 volumes, besides about 250,000\r\npamphlets. It is freely open, as a library of reference and reading, to\r\nthe whole people; but the books are not permitted to be drawn out, except\r\nby Senators and Representatives and a few officials for use at the seat\r\nof government. Its new, commodious and beautiful building, which may\r\nfitly be called the book-palace of the American people, open day and\r\nevening to all comers, is a delight to the eye, and to the mind.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe library of the Boston Athenaeum originated, in the year 1806, with a\r\nsociety of gentlemen of literary tastes, who aimed at creating a\r\nreading-room for the best foreign and American periodicals, together with\r\na library of books. To this a gallery of art was subsequently added. The\r\nundertaking proved at once successful, leaving us to wonder why\r\ncultivated Boston, though abounding in special and parish libraries,\r\nshould so long have done without a good general library; New York having\r\nanticipated her by fifty-two years, and Philadelphia by three-quarters\r\nof a century. The Athenaeum Library is peculiarly rich in files of\r\nAmerican newspapers, both old and new, and its collection of early\r\npamphlets is one of the largest in the country. In literature and science\r\nit embraces a heavy proportion of the best books, its total number of\r\nvolumes being reckoned at 190,000. Its collection of books, pamphlets,\r\nand newspapers relating to the recent civil war is among the completest\r\nknown. The price of a share in the Athenaeum is three hundred dollars, a\r\nlarge sum when compared with that of other proprietary libraries; but it\r\ninvolves much more valuable property-rights than any other. The annual\r\nassessment is five dollars to shareholders, who alone possess the right\r\nto draw books. The proprietors have also the power to grant free\r\nadmission to others, and the library and reading-room are thus thrown\r\nopen for reference to a wide range of readers.\r\n\r\nThe history of the Astor Library, opened in 1854, has been made too\r\nfamiliar by repeated publication to need repetition here. The generous\r\nfounder gave two per cent. out of his fortune of $20,000,000 to create a\r\nfree public library for the city which had given him all his wealth. The\r\ngift was a splendid one, greater than had ever before been given in money\r\nto found a library. Moreover, the $400,000 of Mr. Astor, half a century\r\nago, appeared to be, and perhaps was, a larger sum relatively than four\r\nmillions in New York of to-day. Yet it remains true that the bequest was\r\nbut one-fiftieth part of the fortune of the donor, and that the growth\r\nand even the proper accommodation of the library must have stopped, but\r\nfor the spontaneous supplementary gifts of the principal inheritors of\r\nhis vast wealth.\r\n\r\nThe growth of the Astor library has been very slow, the annual income\r\nfrom what was left of Mr. Astor's $400,000 bequest, after defraying the\r\ncost of the library building, and the $100,000 expended for books at its\r\nfoundation in 1848, having been so small as to necessitate a pinching\r\neconomy, both in salaries of the library staff, and in the annual\r\npurchase of books. It was an example of a generous act performed in a\r\nniggardly way. But after the lapse of half a century, enlightened public\r\npolicy, building upon the Astor foundation, and on the Lenox and Tilden\r\nbequests for founding public libraries in New York city, is about to\r\nequip that long neglected city with a library worthy of the name. There\r\nhas already been gathered from these three united benefactions, a\r\ncollection of no less than 450,000 volumes, making the New York Public\r\nLibrary take rank as the fourth, numerically, in the United States.\r\n\r\nWhile no library in America has yet reached one million volumes, there\r\nare five libraries in Europe, which have passed the million mark. Some of\r\nthese, it is true, are repositories of ancient and mediaeval literature,\r\nchiefly, with a considerable representation of the books of the last\r\ncentury, and but few accessions from the more modern press. Such, for the\r\nmost part, are the numerous libraries of Italy, while others, like the\r\nLibrary of the British Museum, in London, and the National Library, at\r\nParis, are about equally rich in ancient and modern literature. The one\r\ngreat advantage which European libraries possess over American consists\r\nin the stores of ancient literature which the accumulations of the past\r\nhave given them. This advantage, so far as manuscripts and early printed\r\nbooks are concerned, can never be overcome. With one or two hundred\r\nthousand volumes as a basis, what but utter neglect can prevent a library\r\nfrom becoming a great and useful institution? The most moderate share of\r\ndiscrimination, applied to the selection of current literature, will keep\r\nup the character of the collection as a progressive one. But with nothing\r\nat all as a basis, as most of our large American libraries have started,\r\nit will take generations for us to overtake some of the vast collections\r\nof Europe--even numerically.\r\n\r\nIn the \"American Almanac\" for 1837 was published the earliest statistical\r\naccount of American libraries which I have found. It is confined to a\r\nstatement of the numerical contents of twenty public and university\r\nlibraries, being all the American libraries which then (sixty years\r\nsince) contained over 10,000 volumes each. The largest library in the\r\nUnited States at that date was that of the Philadelphia Library Company,\r\nwhich embraced 44,000 volumes. The first organized effort to collect the\r\nfull statistics of libraries in the United States was made in 1849, by\r\nProfessor C. C. Jewett, then librarian of the Smithsonian Institution,\r\nand the results were published in 1851, under the auspices of that\r\ninstitution, in a volume of 207 pages. It contains interesting notices of\r\nnumerous libraries, only forty of which, however, contained as many as\r\n10,000 volumes each. In 1859, Mr. W. J. Rhees, of the Smithsonian\r\nInstitution, published \"A Manual of Public Libraries, Institutions, and\r\nSocieties in the United States,\" a large volume of 687 pages, filled with\r\nstatistical information in great detail, and recording the number of\r\nvolumes in 1338 libraries. This work was an expansion of that of\r\nProfessor Jewett. The next publication of the statistics of American\r\nLibraries, of an official character, was published in \"The National\r\nAlmanac,\" Philadelphia, for the year 1864, pp. 58-62, and was prepared by\r\nthe present writer. It gave the statistics of 104 libraries, each\r\nnumbering 10,000 volumes or upwards, exhibiting a gratifying progress in\r\nall the larger collections, and commemorating the more advanced and\r\nvigorous of the new libraries which had sprung into life.\r\n\r\nThe work of collecting and publishing the statistics of American\r\nLibraries has for years past been admirably performed by the United\r\nStates Bureau of Education. Begun in 1875, that institution has issued\r\nfour tabular statements of all libraries responding to its circulars of\r\ninquiry, and having (as last reported in 1897) one thousand volumes or\r\nupwards. Besides these invaluable reports, costing much careful labor and\r\ngreat expense, the Bureau of Education published, in 1876, an extensive\r\nwork wholly devoted to the subject of libraries, bearing the title\r\n\"Special Report on Public Libraries in the United States.\" This\r\npublication (now wholly out of print) consisted of 1222 pages, replete\r\nwith information upon the history, management, and condition of American\r\nLibraries, under the editorship of S. R. Warren and S. N. Clark, of the\r\nBureau of Education. It embraced many original contributions upon topics\r\nconnected with library science, by experienced librarians, _viz._:\r\nMessrs. W. F. Poole, Justin Winsor, C. A. Cutter, J. S. Billings, Theo.\r\nGill, Melvil Dewey, O. H. Robinson, W. I. Fletcher, F. B. Perkins, H. A.\r\nHomes, A. R. Spofford, and others.\r\n\r\nI have prepared a table of the numerical contents of the thirty-four\r\nlargest libraries in this country in 1897, being all those having 100,000\r\nvolumes each or upwards:\r\n\r\nLibrary of Congress, Washington,                          840,000\r\nBoston Public Library, Boston,                            730,000\r\nHarvard University Library, Cambridge,                    510,000\r\nNew York Public Library, New York City,                   450,000\r\nUniversity of Chicago Library,                            335,000\r\nNew York State Library, Albany,                           320,710\r\nYale University Library, New Haven,                       285,000\r\nNew York Mercantile Library, New York,                    270,000\r\nColumbia University Library, New York,                    260,000\r\nChicago Public Library,                                   235,385\r\nCincinnati Public Library,                                223,043\r\nCornell University Library, Ithaca, N.

In fact, the public spirit which gives freely of\r\nprivate wealth to enlarge the intelligence of the community may be said\r\nto grow by emulation. Many men who have made fortunes have endowed their\r\nnative places with libraries. It is yearly becoming more and more widely\r\nrecognized that a man can build no monument to himself so honorable or so\r\nlasting as a free public library. Its influence is well nigh universal,\r\nand its benefits are perennial.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe now come to consider the city or town libraries, created or maintained\r\nby voluntary taxation. These, like the class of libraries founded by\r\nprivate munificence, are purely a modern growth. While the earliest\r\nmovement in this direction in Great Britain dates back only to 1850, New\r\nHampshire has the honor of adopting the first free public library law, in\r\nAmerica, in the year 1849. Massachusetts followed in 1851, and the\r\nexample was emulated by other States at various intervals, until there\r\nnow remain but fifteen out of our forty-five States which have no public\r\nlibrary law. The general provisions of these laws authorize any town or\r\ncity to collect taxes by vote of the citizens for maintaining a public\r\nlibrary, to be managed by trustees elected or appointed for the purpose.\r\n\r\nBut a more far-reaching provision for supplying the people with public\r\nlibraries was adopted by New Hampshire (again the pioneer State), in\r\n1895. This was nothing less than the passage of a State law making it\r\ncompulsory on every town in New Hampshire to assess annually the sum of\r\nthirty dollars for every dollar of public taxes apportioned to such town,\r\nthe amount to be appropriated to establish and maintain a free public\r\nlibrary. Library trustees are to be elected, and in towns where no public\r\nlibrary exists, the money is to be held by them, and to accumulate until\r\nthe town is ready to establish a library.\r\n\r\nThis New Hampshire statute, making obligatory the supply of public\r\ninformation through books and periodicals in free libraries in every\r\ntown, may fairly be termed the high-water mark of modern means for the\r\ndiffusion of knowledge. This system of creating libraries proceeds upon\r\nthe principle that intellectual enlightenment is as much a concern of the\r\nlocal government as sanitary regulations or public morality. Society has\r\nan interest that is common to all classes in the means that are provided\r\nfor the education of the people. Among these means free town or city\r\nlibraries are one of the most potent and useful. New Hampshire and\r\nMassachusetts, in nearly all of their towns and cities, have recognized\r\nthe principle that public books are just as important to the general\r\nwelfare as public lamps. What are everywhere needed are libraries open to\r\nthe people as a matter of right, and not as a matter of favor.\r\n\r\nThe largest library in the country, save one (that at Washington), owes\r\nits origin and success to this principle, combined with some private\r\nmunificence. The Boston Public Library is unquestionably one of the most\r\nwidely useful collections of books open to the public in this country. Of\r\nall the greater collections, it is the only one which lends out books\r\nfree of charge to all citizens. Instituted in 1852, its career has been\r\none of rapid progress and ever widening usefulness. I shall not dwell\r\nupon it at length, as the facts regarding it have been more widely\r\npublished than those relating to any other library.\r\n\r\nUnder the permissive library laws of thirty States, there had been formed\r\nup to 1896, when the last comprehensive statistics were gathered, about\r\n1,200 free public libraries, supported by taxation, in the United States.\r\n\r\nA still more widely successful means of securing a library foundation\r\nthat shall be permanent is found in uniting private benefactions with\r\npublic money to found or to maintain a library. Many public-spirited\r\ncitizens, fortunately endowed with large means, have offered to erect\r\nlibrary buildings in certain places, on condition that the local\r\nauthorities would provide the books, and the means of maintaining a free\r\nlibrary. Such generous offers, whether coupled with the condition of\r\nperpetuating the donor's name with that of the library, or leaving the\r\ngift unhampered, so that the library may bear the name of the town or\r\ncity of its location, have generally been accepted by municipal bodies,\r\nor by popular vote. This secures, in most cases, a good working library\r\nof choice reading, as well as its steady annual growth and management,\r\nfree of the heavy expense of building, of which the tax-payers are\r\nrelieved. The many munificent gifts of library buildings by Mr. Andrew\r\nCarnegie, to American towns and cities, and to some in his native\r\nScotland, are worthy of special note. And the reader will see from the\r\nlong list heretofore given of the more considerable public libraries to\r\nbe credited wholly or in part to private munificence, that American men\r\nof wealth have not been wanting as public benefactors.\r\n\r\nIn some cases, whole libraries have been given to a town or village where\r\na public library already existed, or liberal gifts or bequests of money,\r\nto be expended in the enrichment of such libraries, have been bestowed.\r\nVery interesting lists of benefactions for the benefit of libraries may\r\nbe found in the volumes of the Library Journal, New York. It is with\r\nregret that candor requires me to add, that several proffers of fine\r\nlibrary buildings to certain places, coupled with the condition that the\r\nmunicipal authorities would establish and maintain a free library, have\r\nremained without acceptance, thus forfeiting a liberal endowment. Where\r\npublic education has been so neglected as to render possible such a\r\nniggardly, penny-wise and pound-foolish policy, there is manifestly\r\nsignal need of every means of enlightenment.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe now come to the various State libraries founded at the public charge,\r\nand designed primarily for the use of the respective legislatures of the\r\nStates. The earliest of these is the New Hampshire State Library,\r\nestablished in 1790, and the largest is the New York State Library, at\r\nAlbany, founded in 1818, now embracing 325,000 volumes, and distinguished\r\nalike by the value of its stores and the liberality of its management.\r\nThe reason for being of a State library is obviously and primarily to\r\nfurnish the legislative body and State courts with such ample books of\r\nreference in jurisprudence, history, science, etc., as will aid them in\r\nthe intelligent discharge of their duties as law-makers and judges of the\r\nlaw. The library thus existing at each State capital may well be opened\r\nto the public for reading and reference, thus greatly enlarging its\r\nusefulness.\r\n\r\nEvery State in the Union has now at least a legislative library, although\r\nthe most of them consist chiefly of laws and legislative documents, with\r\na few works of reference superadded; and their direct usefulness to the\r\npublic is therefore very circumscribed. The New York State Library is a\r\nmodel of what a great public library should be in the capital of a State.\r\nIn it are gathered a great proportion of the best books in each\r\ndepartment of literature and science, while indefatigable efforts have\r\nbeen made to enrich it in whatever relates to American history and\r\npolity. Its reading-room is freely opened to the public during many hours\r\ndaily. But a State library should never be made a library of circulation,\r\nsince its utility as a reference library, having its books always in for\r\nthose who seek them, would thereby be destroyed. Even under the existing\r\nsystem, with the privilege of drawing books out confined to the\r\nLegislature, some of the State libraries have been depleted and despoiled\r\nof many of their most valuable books, through loaning them freely on the\r\norders of members. The sense of responsibility is far less in the case of\r\nborrowed books which are government property, than in other cases. The\r\nonly safe rule for keeping a government library from being scattered, is\r\nstrict refusal of orders for loaning to any one not legally entitled to\r\ndraw books, and short terms of withdrawal to legislators, with\r\nenforcement of a rule of replacement, at their expense, as to all books\r\nnot returned at the end of each session.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere is one class of libraries not yet touched upon, namely, school\r\ndistrict libraries. These originated for the first time in a legally\r\norganized system, through an act of the New York State Legislature in\r\n1835, authorizing the voters in each school district to levy a tax of\r\ntwenty dollars with which to start a library, and ten dollars a year for\r\nadding to the same. These were not to be for the schools alone, but for\r\nall the people living in the district where the school was located. This\r\nwas supplemented in 1838 by a State appropriation of $55,000 a year, from\r\nNew York's share of the surplus revenue fund distributed by Congress to\r\nthe States in 1837, and the income of which was devoted by New York to\r\nenlarging the school district libraries. After spending nearly two\r\nmillions of dollars on these libraries in forty years, the system was\r\nfound to have been so far a failure that the volumes in the libraries had\r\ndecreased from 1,600,000 to 700,000 volumes.\r\n\r\nThis extraordinary and deplorable result was attributed to several\r\ndistinct causes. 1st. No proper responsibility as to the use and return\r\nof books was enforced. 2d. The insignificance of the sum raised by\r\ntaxation in each district prevented any considerable supply of books from\r\nbeing acquired. 3d. The funds were largely devoted to buying the same\r\nbooks in each school district, instead of being expended in building up a\r\nlarge and varied collection. Thus the system produced innumerable petty\r\nlibraries of duplicates, enriching publishers and booksellers, while\r\nimpoverishing the community. The school district library system, in\r\nshort, while promising much in theory, in the way of public intelligence,\r\nbroke down completely in practice. The people quickly lost interest in\r\nlibraries which gave them so little variety in books, either of\r\ninstruction or of recreation.\r\n\r\nAlthough widely introduced in other States besides New York, from 1837 to\r\n1877, it proved an admitted failure in all. Much public money, raised by\r\ntaxation of the people, was squandered upon sets of books, selected by\r\nState authority, and often of inferior interest and utility. Finally, it\r\nwas recognized that school district libraries were an evanescent dream,\r\nand that town libraries must take their place. This instructive chapter\r\nin Library history shows an experience by which much was learned, though\r\nthe lesson was a costly one.\r\n\r\nThe Historical libraries of the country are numerous, and some of the\r\nlarger ones are rich in printed Americana, and in historical manuscripts.\r\nThe oldest is that of the Massachusetts Historical Society, founded in\r\n1791, and among the most extensive are those of the New York Historical\r\nSociety, American Antiquarian Society, the Historical Society of\r\nPennsylvania, the New England Historic-genealogical Society, and the\r\nWisconsin State Historical Society. There are no less than 230 historical\r\nsocieties in the U. S., some forty of which are State associations.\r\n\r\nThe Mercantile libraries are properly a branch of the proprietary, though\r\ndepending mostly upon annual subscriptions. The earliest of these was the\r\nBoston Mercantile Library, founded in 1820, and followed closely by the\r\nNew York Mercantile the same year, the Philadelphia in 1821, and the\r\nCincinnati Mercantile in 1835.\r\n\r\nNext we have the professional libraries, law, medical, scientific, and,\r\nin several cities, theological. These supply a want of each of these\r\nprofessions seldom met by the public collections, and are proportionately\r\nvaluable.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe most recent plan for the wide diffusion of popular books is the\r\ntravelling library. This originated in New York in 1893, when the\r\nLegislature empowered the Regents of the State University (a body of\r\ntrustees having charge of all library interests in that State) to send\r\nout selections of books to any community without a library, on request of\r\n25 resident taxpayers. The results were most beneficial, the sole\r\nexpense being five dollars for each library.\r\n\r\nTravelling libraries, (mostly of fifty volumes each) have been set on\r\nfoot in Massachusetts, Michigan, Iowa, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and other\r\nStates, and, as the system appears capable of indefinite expansion, great\r\nresults are anticipated in the direction of the public intelligence. It\r\nis pointed out that while the State, by its free school system, trains\r\nall the people to read, it should not leave the quality of their reading\r\nto chance or to utter neglect, when a few cents _per capita_ annually\r\nwould help them to an education of inestimable value in after life.\r\n\r\nSome objections, on the other hand, have been urged to the system, as\r\nintroducing features of paternalism into State government, and taking out\r\nof the hands of individual generosity and local effort and enterprise\r\nwhat belongs properly to such agencies. The vexed question of the proper\r\nfunction and limitations of State control in the domain of education\r\ncannot here be entered upon.\r\n\r\nIn the volume last published of statistics of American libraries, that of\r\n1897, great progress was shown in the five years since 1891. The record\r\nof libraries reported in 1896 embraced 4,026 collections, being all which\r\ncontained over 1,000 volumes each. The increase in volumes in the five\r\nyears was a little over seven millions, the aggregate of the 4,026\r\nlibraries being 33,051,872 volumes. This increase was over 27 per cent.\r\nin only five years.\r\n\r\nIf the good work so splendidly begun, in New England, New York,\r\nPennsylvania, and some of the Western States, in establishing libraries\r\nthrough public taxation and private munificence, can only be extended in\r\nthe Southern and Middle States, the century now about to dawn will\r\nwitness an advance quite as remarkable as we have seen in the latter\r\nyears of the century about to close.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] MS. Records of the Virginia Company, in the Library of Congress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 16.\r\n\r\nLIBRARY BUILDINGS AND FURNISHINGS.\r\n\r\n\r\nProceeding now to the subject of library buildings, reading-rooms, and\r\nfurnishings, it must be remarked at the outset that very few rules can be\r\nlaid down which are of universal application. The architectural plans,\r\nexterior and interior, of such great institutions as the Library of\r\nCongress, or the Boston Public Library, with their costly marbles,\r\nsplendid mural decorations, and electric book-serving machinery, afford\r\nno model for the library building in the country village. Where the\r\ngovernment of a nation or a wealthy city has millions to devote for\r\nproviding a magnificent book-palace for its library, the smaller cities\r\nor towns have only a few thousands. So much the more important is it,\r\nthat a thoroughly well-considered plan for building should be marked out\r\nbefore beginning to build, that no dollars should be wasted, or costly\r\nalterations required, in order to fit the interior for all the uses of a\r\nlibrary.\r\n\r\nThe need of this caution will be abundantly evident, in the light of the\r\nunfit and inconvenient constructions seen in so many public libraries,\r\nall over the country. So general has been the want of carefully planned\r\nand well-executed structures for books, that it may fairly be said that\r\nmistakes have been the rule, and fit adaptation the exception. For twenty\r\nyears past, at every meeting of the American Library Association, the\r\nreports upon library buildings have deplored the waste of money in\r\nwell-meant edifices designed to accommodate the library service, but\r\nsuccessful only in obstructing it. Even in so recent a construction as\r\nthe Boston Public Library building, so many defects and inconveniences\r\nwere found after it was supposed to have been finished, that rooms had to\r\nbe torn out and re-constructed on three floors, while the pneumatic tube\r\nsystem had been found so noisy as to be a public nuisance, and had to be\r\nreplaced by a later improved construction.\r\n\r\nOne leading cause for the mistakes which are so patent in our library\r\nbuildings is that they are not planned by librarians but mainly by\r\narchitects. The library authorities commonly take it for granted that the\r\nable architect is master of his profession, and entrust him with the\r\nwhole design, leaving out of account the librarian, as a mere\r\nsubordinate, entitled only to secondary consideration. The result is a\r\nplan which exhibits, in its prominent features, the architect's skill in\r\neffective pilasters, pillars, architraves, cornices, and balustrades,\r\nwhile the library apartments which these features ornament are planned,\r\nnot for convenient and rapid book-service, but mainly for show. It is the\r\ninterest of architects to magnify their profession: and as none of them\r\nhas ever been, or ever will be a librarian, they cannot be expected to\r\ncarry into effect unaided, what they have never learned; namely, the\r\ninterior arrangements which will best meet the utilities of the library\r\nservice. Here is where the librarian's practical experience, or his\r\nobservation of the successes or failures in the reading-room and delivery\r\nservice of other libraries, should imperatively be called in. Let him\r\ndemonstrate to the governing board that he knows what is needed for\r\nprompt and economical administration, and they will heed his judgment, if\r\nthey are reasonable men. While it belongs to the architect to plan,\r\naccording to his own ideas, the outside of the building, the inside\r\nshould be planned by the architect in direct concert with the librarian,\r\nin all save merely ornamental or finishing work.\r\n\r\nWe do not erect a building and then determine whether it is to be a\r\nschool house or a church: it is planned from the start with strict\r\nreference to the utilities involved; and so should it always be with a\r\nlibrary.\r\n\r\nIn treating this subject, I shall not occupy space in outlining the\r\nproper scheme of building and interior arrangement for a great library,\r\nwith its many distinct departments, for such institutions are the\r\nexceptions, while most libraries come within the rule of very moderate\r\nsize, and comparatively inexpensive equipment. The first requisite for a\r\npublic library, then, is a good location. It is important that this\r\nshould be central, but it is equally important that the building should\r\nbe isolated--that is, with proper open space on all sides, and not\r\nlocated in a block with other buildings. Many libraries have been\r\ndestroyed or seriously damaged by fire originating in neighboring\r\nbuildings, or in other apartments in the same building; while fires in\r\nseparate library buildings have been extremely rare. It would be a wise\r\nprovision to secure a library lot sufficiently large in area to admit of\r\nfurther additions to the building, both in the rear and at the side; and\r\nwith slight addition to the cost, the walls and their supports may be so\r\nplanned as to admit of this. Committees are seldom willing to incur the\r\nexpense of an edifice large enough to provide for very prolonged growth\r\nof their collection; and the result is that the country is full of\r\novercrowded libraries, without money to build, and prevented from\r\nexpanding on the spot because no foresight was exercised in the original\r\nconstruction or land purchase, to provide for ready increase of space by\r\nwidening out, and removing an outer wall so as to connect the old\r\nbuilding with the new addition. If a library has 10,000 volumes, it would\r\nbe very short-sighted policy to plan an edifice to contain less than\r\n40,000, which it is likely to reach in from ten to forty years.\r\n\r\nThe next requisite to a central and sufficient site is that the location\r\nmust be dry and airy. Any low site, especially in river towns, will be\r\ndamp, and among the enemies of books, moisture holds a foremost place.\r\nNext, the site should afford light on all sides, and if necessary to\r\nplace it near any thoroughfare, it should be set back so as to afford\r\nample light and ventilation in front.\r\n\r\nIt need hardly be said that every library building should be fire-proof,\r\nafter the many costly lessons we have had of the burning of public\r\nlibraries at home and abroad. The material for the outside walls may be\r\nbrick or stone, according to taste or relative cost. Brick is good\r\nenough, and if of the best quality, and treated with stone trimmings, is\r\ncapable of sufficiently ornate effects, and is quite as durable as any\r\ngranite or marble. No temptation of cheapness should ever be allowed to\r\nintroduce wood in any part of the construction: walls, floors, and roof\r\nshould be only of brick, stone, iron, or slate. A wooden roof is nothing\r\nbut a tinder-box that invites the flames.\r\n\r\nIn general, two stories is a sufficient height for library buildings,\r\nexcept in those of the largest class, and the upper floors may be amply\r\nlighted by sky-lights. The side-lights can hardly be too numerous: yet I\r\nhave seen library buildings running back from a street fifty to\r\nseventy-five feet, without a single window in either of the side walls.\r\nThe result was to throw all the books on shelves into a gloomy shade for\r\nmany hours of each day.\r\n\r\nThe interior construction should be so managed as to effect the finding\r\nand delivery of books to readers with the greatest possible economy of\r\ntime and space. No shelves should be placed higher than can be reached by\r\nhand without mounting upon any steps or ladders; _i. e._, seven to seven\r\nand a half feet. The system of shelving should all be constructed of iron\r\nor steel, instead of surrounding the books on three sides with\r\ncombustible wood, as is done in most libraries. Shelves of oxidized metal\r\nwill be found smooth enough to prevent any abrasion of bindings. Shelves\r\nshould be easily adjustable to any height, to accommodate the various\r\nsizes of books.\r\n\r\nIn calculating shelf capacity, one and a half inches thickness a volume\r\nis a fair average, so that each hundred volumes would require about\r\nthirteen feet of linear shelf measurement. The space between uprights,\r\nthat is, the length of each shelf, should not exceed two and a half feet.\r\nAll spaces between shelves should be 10½ or 11 inches high, to\r\naccommodate large octavos indiscriminately with smaller sizes; and a base\r\nshelf for quartos and folios, at a proper height from the floor, will\r\nrestrict the number of shelves to six in each tier.\r\n\r\nIn the arrangement of the cases or book-stacks, the most economical\r\nmethod is to place book-cases of double face, not less than three feet\r\napart, approached by aisles on either side, so as to afford free passage\r\nfor two persons meeting or passing one another. The cases may be about\r\nten feet each in length. There should be electric lights between all\r\ncases, to be turned on only when books are sought. The cases should be\r\nset at right angles to the wall, two or three feet from it, with the\r\nlight from abundant windows coming in between them. The width of shelves\r\nmay be from 16 to 18 inches in these double cases, thus giving about\r\neight to nine inches depth to each side. No partition is required between\r\nthe two sides.\r\n\r\nIt should be stated that the light obtained from windows, when thrown\r\nmore than twenty feet, among cases of books on shelves, becomes too\r\nfeeble for effective use in finding books. This fact should be considered\r\nin advance, while plans of construction, lighting, and interior\r\narrangement are being made. All experience has shown that too much light\r\ncannot be had in any public library.\r\n\r\nRailings and stair-cases for the second or upper floors should be of\r\nperforated iron.\r\n\r\nThe reading-room should be distinct from the book delivery or\r\ncharging-room, to secure quiet for readers at all hours, avoiding the\r\npressure, hurry and noise of conversation inevitable in a lending library\r\nor department. In the reading-room should be shelved a liberal supply of\r\nbooks of reference, and bibliographies, open without tickets to the\r\nreaders. Next the central desk there should be shelves for the deposit of\r\nbooks reserved day by day for the use of readers. The library chairs, of\r\nwhatever pattern may be preferred, should always combine the two\r\nrequisites of strength and lightness. The floor should be covered with\r\nlinoleum, or some similar floor covering, to deaden sound. Woolen\r\ncarpets, those perennial breeders of dust, are an abomination.\r\n\r\nIn a library reading-room of any considerable size, each reader should be\r\nprovided with table or desk room, not flat but sloping at a moderate\r\nangle, and allowing about three feet of space for each reader. These\r\nappliances for study need not be single pieces of furniture, but made in\r\nsections to accommodate from three to six readers at each. About thirty\r\ninches from the floor is a proper height.\r\n\r\nFor large dictionaries, atlases, or other bulky volumes, the adjustable\r\nrevolving case, mounted on a pedestal, should be used.\r\n\r\nFor moving any large number of volumes about the library, book-trucks or\r\nbarrows, with noiseless rubber wheels, are required.\r\n\r\nEvery library will need one or more catalogue cases to hold the\r\nalphabetical card catalogue. These are made with a maximum of skill by\r\nthe Library Bureau, Boston.\r\n\r\nThe location of the issue-counter or desk is of cardinal importance. It\r\nshould be located near the centre of the system of book-cases, or near\r\nthe entrance to the stack, so as to minimize the time consumed in\r\ncollecting the books wanted. It should also have a full supply of light,\r\nand this may be secured by a location directly in front of a large side\r\nwindow. Readers are impatient of delay, and the farther the books are\r\nfrom the issue-counter the longer they will have to wait for them.\r\n\r\nAmong modern designs for libraries, that of Dr. W. F. Poole, adapted for\r\nthe Newberry Library, Chicago, is notable for dividing the library into\r\nmany departments or separate rooms, the book shelves occupying one half\r\nthe height of each, or 7½ feet out of 15, the remaining space being\r\noccupied by windows. This construction, of course, does not furnish as\r\ncompact storage for books as the stack system. It is claimed to possess\r\nthe advantage of extraordinarily good light, and of aiding the researches\r\nof readers. But it has the disadvantage of requiring readers to visit\r\nwidely separated rooms to pursue studies involving several subjects, and\r\nof mounting in elevators to reach some departments. A system which brings\r\nthe books to the reader, instead of the readers travelling after the\r\nbooks, would appear to be more practically useful to the public, with\r\nwhom time is of cardinal importance.\r\n\r\nIn all libraries, there should be a receiving or packing room, where\r\nboxes and parcels of books are opened and books mended, collated, and\r\nprepared for the shelves. This room may well be in a dry and well lighted\r\nbasement. Two small cloak-rooms for wraps will be needed, one for each\r\nsex. Two toilet rooms or lavatories should be provided. A room for the\r\nlibrary directors or trustees, and one for the librarian, are essential\r\nin libraries of much extent. A janitor's room or sleeping quarters\r\nsometimes needs to be provided. A storage room for blanks, stationery,\r\ncatalogues, etc., will be necessary in libraries of much extent. A\r\nperiodical room is sometimes provided, distinct from the reading-room or\r\nthe delivery department. In this case, if several hundred periodicals are\r\ntaken, an attendant should be always present to serve them to readers,\r\nfrom the shelves or cases where they should be kept in alphabetical\r\norder. Without this, and a ticket system to keep track of what are in\r\nuse, no one can readily find what is needed, nor ascertain whether it is\r\nin a reader's hands when sought for. System and the alphabet alone will\r\nsolve all difficulties.\r\n\r\nAs to the space required for readers in a periodical room, it may be\r\nassumed that about five hundred square feet will accommodate twenty-five\r\nreaders, and the same proportion for a larger number at one time. A room\r\ntwenty-five by forty would seat fifty readers, while one twenty-five by\r\ntwenty would accommodate twenty-five readers, with proper space for\r\ntables, &c. The files for newspapers are referred to in another chapter\r\non periodicals.\r\n\r\nIn a library building, the heating and ventilation are of prime\r\nimportance. Upon their proper regulation largely depends the health and\r\nconsequently the efficiency of all employed, as well as the comfort of\r\nthe reading public. There is no space to enter upon specific\r\ndescriptions, for which the many conflicting systems, with experience of\r\ntheir practical working, should be examined. Suffice it to say in\r\ngeneral, that a temperature not far below nor above 70 degrees Fahrenheit\r\nshould be aimed at; that the furnace, with its attendant nuisances of\r\nnoise, dust, and odors, should be outside the library building--not under\r\nit; and that electric lighting alone should be used, gas being highly\r\ninjurious to the welfare of books.\r\n\r\nIn calculating the space required for books shelved as has been\r\nheretofore suggested, it may be approximately stated that every one\r\nthousand volumes will require at least eighty to one hundred square feet\r\nof floor measurement. Thus, a library of 10,000 volumes would occupy an\r\narea of nearly one thousand square feet. But it is necessary to provide\r\nalso for the continual growth of the collection. To do this, experience\r\nshows that in any flourishing public library, space should be reserved\r\nfor three or four times the number of volumes in actual possession. If\r\nrooms are hired for the books, because of inability to build, the library\r\nshould be so arranged as to leave each alternate shelf vacant for\r\nadditions, or, in the more rapidly growing divisions, a still greater\r\nspace. This will permit accessions to be shelved with their related\r\nbooks, without the trouble of frequently moving and re-arranging large\r\ndivisions of the library. This latter is a very laborious process, and\r\nshould be resorted to only under compulsion. The preventive remedy, of\r\nmaking sure of space in advance, by leaving a sufficiency of unoccupied\r\nshelves in every division of the library, is the true one.\r\n\r\nIn some libraries, a separate reading-room for ladies is provided. Mr. W.\r\nF. Poole records that in Cincinnati such a room was opened at the\r\ninstance of the library directors. The result was that the ladies made it\r\na kind of social rendezvous, where they talked over society matters, and\r\nexhibited the bargains made in their shopping excursions. Ladies who came\r\nto study preferred the general reading room, where they found every\r\ncomfort among well conducted gentlemen, and the \"ladies' reading-room\"\r\nwas abandoned, as not fulfilling its object. The same experiment in the\r\nChicago Public Library had the same result.\r\n\r\nSome libraries in the larger towns provide a special reading-room for\r\nchildren; and this accomplishes a two-fold object, namely, to keep the\r\npublic reading-room free from flocks of little people in pursuit of books\r\nunder difficulties, and to furnish the boys and girls with\r\naccommodations of their own. It may be suggested as an objection, that\r\nthe dividing line as to age is difficult to be drawn: but let each\r\napplicant be questioned, and if falling below twelve, or fifteen, or\r\nwhatever the age limit may be, directed to the juvenile reading-room, and\r\nthere need be no trouble. Of course there will be some quite young\r\nreaders who are gifted with intelligence beyond their years, and who may\r\ndislike to be reckoned as children; but library rules are not made to\r\nsuit exceptions, but for the average; and as no book need be refused to\r\nany applicant in the juvenile department, no just cause of complaint can\r\narise.\r\n\r\nIn some libraries, and those usually of the larger size, an art room is\r\nprovided, where students of works on painting, sculpture, and the\r\ndecorative arts can go, and have about them whatever treasures the\r\nlibrary may contain in that attractive field. The advantages of this\r\nprovision are, first, to save the necessity of handling and carrying so\r\nmany heavy volumes of galleries of art and illustrated books to the\r\ngeneral reading-room, and back again, and secondly, to enable those in\r\ncharge of the art department to exercise more strict supervision in\r\nenforcing careful and cleanly treatment of the finest books in the\r\nlibrary, than can be maintained in the miscellaneous crowd of readers in\r\nthe main reading-room. The objections to it concern the general want of\r\nroom to set apart for this purpose, and the desirability of concentrating\r\nthe use of books in one main hall or reading-room. Circumstances and\r\nexperience should determine the question for each library.\r\n\r\nSome public libraries, and especially those constructed in recent years,\r\nare provided with a lecture-hall, or a large room for public meetings,\r\nconcerts, or occasionally, even an opera-house, in the same building with\r\nthe library. There are some excellent arguments in favor of this; and\r\nespecially where a public benefactor donates to a city a building which\r\ncombines both uses. The building given by Mr. Andrew Carnegie to the\r\nPublic Library of Washington will be provided with a small hall suited to\r\nmeetings, &c. But in all cases, such a public hall should be so isolated\r\nfrom the library reading-room as not to annoy readers, to whom quiet is\r\nessential. This end can be effected by having the intervening walls and\r\nfloors so constructed as completely to deaden sound. A wholly distinct\r\nentrance should also be provided, not communicating with the doors and\r\npassages leading to the library.\r\n\r\nComparisons are sometimes made as to the relative cost of library\r\nbuildings to the number of volumes they are designed to accommodate; but\r\nsuch estimates are misleading. The cost of an edifice in which\r\narchitectural beauty and interior decoration concur to make it a\r\npermanent ornament to a city or town, need not be charged up at so much\r\nper volume. Buildings for libraries have cost all the way from\r\ntwenty-five cents up to $4. for each volume stored. The Library of\r\nCongress, which cost six million dollars, and will ultimately accommodate\r\n4,500,000 volumes, cost about $1.36 per volume. But it contains besides\r\nbooks, some half a million musical compositions, works of graphic art,\r\nmaps and charts, etc.\r\n\r\nThe comparative cost of some library buildings erected in recent years,\r\nwith ultimate capacity of each, may be of interest. Kansas City Public\r\nLibrary, 132+144, 125,000 vols., $200,000. Newark, N. J. Free Library,\r\n138+216, 400,000 vols., $188,000. Forbes Library, Northampton, Mass.\r\n(granite), 107+137, 250,000 vols., $134,000. Fall River, Ms. Library,\r\n80+130, 250,000 vols., $100,000. Peoria, Ill. Public Library (brick),\r\n76+135, $70,000. Smiley Memorial Library, Redlands, Cal. (brick), 96+100,\r\n$50,000. Reuben Hoar Library, Littleton, Mass. (brick), 50+57, 25,000\r\nvols., $25,000. Rogers Memorial Library, Southworth, N. Y. 70+100, 20,000\r\nvols., $20,000. Belfast (Me.) Free Library (granite), 27+54, $10,000.\r\nGail-Borden Public Library, Elgin, Ill. (brick), 28+52, $9,000. Warwick,\r\nMass. Public Library (wood), 45+60, 5,000 vols., $5,000.\r\n\r\nThe largely increased number of public library buildings erected in\r\nrecent years is a most cheering sign of the times. Since 1895, eleven\r\nextensive new library buildings have been opened: namely, the Library of\r\nCongress, the Boston Public Library, the Pratt Institute Library,\r\nBrooklyn, the Columbia University Library, New York, the Princeton, N. J.\r\nUniversity Library, the Hart Memorial Library, of Troy, N. Y., the\r\nCarnegie Library, Pittsburgh, the Chicago Public Library, the Peoria,\r\nIll. Public Library, the Kansas City, Mo. Public Library, and the Omaha,\r\nNeb. Public Library.\r\n\r\nAnd there are provided for eight more public library buildings, costing\r\nmore than $100,000 each; namely, the Providence, R. I. Public Library,\r\nthe Lynn, Mass. Public Library, the Fall River, Mass. Public Library, the\r\nNewark, N. J. Free Public Library, the Milwaukee, Wis. Public Library and\r\nMuseum, the Wisconsin State Historical Society Library, Madison, the New\r\nYork Public Library, and the Jersey City Public Library.\r\n\r\nTo these will be added within the year 1900, as is confidently expected,\r\nthe Washington City Public Library, the gift of Andrew Carnegie, to cost\r\n$300,000.\r\n\r\nNo philanthropist can ever find a nobler object for his fortune, or a\r\nmore enduring monument to his memory, than the founding of a free public\r\nlibrary. The year 1899 has witnessed a new gift by Mr. Carnegie of a one\r\nhundred thousand dollar library to Atlanta, the Capital of Georgia, on\r\ncondition that the city will provide a site, and $5,000 a year for the\r\nmaintenance of the library. Cities in the east are emulating one another\r\nin providing public library buildings of greater or less cost. If the\r\ntown library cannot have magnificence, it need not have meanness. A\r\ncompetition among architects selected to submit plans is becoming the\r\nfavorite method of preparing to build. Five of the more extensive\r\nlibraries have secured competitive plans of late from which to\r\nselect--namely, the New York Public Library, the Jersey City Public\r\nLibrary, the Newark Free Public Library, the Lynn Public Library, and the\r\nPhoebe Hearst building for the University of California, which is to be\r\nplanned for a library of 750,000 volumes. It is gratifying to add that in\r\nseveral recent provisions made for erecting large and important\r\nstructures, the librarian was made a member of the building\r\ncommittee--_i. e._, in the New York Public Library, the Newark Free\r\nPublic Library, and the Lynn Public Library.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 17.\r\n\r\nLIBRARY MANAGERS OR TRUSTEES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe now come to consider the management of libraries as entrusted to\r\nboards of directors, trustees or library managers. These relations have a\r\nmost intimate bearing upon the foundation, the progress and the\r\nconsequent success of any library. Where a liberal intelligence and a\r\nhearty coöperation are found in those constituting the library board, the\r\naffairs of the institution will be managed with the best results. Where\r\na narrow-minded and dictatorial spirit is manifested, even by a portion\r\nof those supervising a public library, it will require a large endowment\r\nboth of patience and of tact in the librarian, to accomplish those aims\r\nwhich involve the highest usefulness.\r\n\r\nBoards of library trustees vary in number, usually from three to nine or\r\nmore. A board of three or five is found in practice more active and\r\nefficient than a larger number. The zeal and responsibility felt is apt\r\nto diminish in direct proportion to the increased numbers of the board.\r\nAn odd number is preferable, to avoid an equal division of opinion upon\r\nany question to be determined.\r\n\r\nIn town or city libraries, the mode of selection of library trustees\r\nvaries much. Sometimes the mayor appoints the library board, sometimes\r\nthey are chosen by the city council, and sometimes elected by the people,\r\nat the annual selection of school or municipal officers. The term of\r\nservice (most usually three years) should be so arranged that retirement\r\nof any members should always leave two at least who have had experience\r\non the board. Library trustees serve without salary, the high honor of so\r\nserving the public counting for much.\r\n\r\nThe librarian is often made secretary of the trustees, and then he keeps\r\nthe record of their transactions. He should never be made treasurer of\r\nthe library funds, which would involve labor and responsibility\r\nincompatible with the manifold duties of the superintendent of a library.\r\nIn case of a library supported by municipal taxation, the town treasurer\r\nmay well serve as library treasurer also, or the trustees can choose one\r\nfrom their own board. The librarian, however, should be empowered to\r\ncollect book fines or other dues, to be deposited with the treasurer at\r\nregular intervals, and he should have a small fund at disposal for such\r\npetty library expenses as constantly arise. All bills for books and\r\nother purchases, and all salaries of persons employed in the library\r\nshould be paid by the treasurer.\r\n\r\nThe meetings of the trustees should be attended by the librarian, who\r\nmust always be ready to supply all information as to the workings of the\r\nlibrary, the needs for books, etc. Frequently the trustees divide up the\r\nbusiness before them, appointing sub-committees on book selections, on\r\nlibrary finances, on administration, furnishings, &c., with a view to\r\nprompt action.\r\n\r\nIf a library receives endowments, money gifts or legacies, they are held\r\nand administered by the trustees as a body corporate, the same as the\r\nfunds annually appropriated for library maintenance and increase. Their\r\nannual report to the council, or municipal authorities, should exhibit\r\nthe amount of money received from all sources in detail, and the amount\r\nexpended for all purposes, in detail; also, the number of books purchased\r\nin the year, the aggregate of volumes in the library, the number of\r\nreaders, and other facts of general interest.\r\n\r\nAll accounts against the library are first audited by the proper\r\nsub-committee, and payment ordered by the full board, by order on the\r\ntreasurer. The accounts for all these expenditures should be kept by the\r\ntreasurer, who should inform the librarian periodically as to balances.\r\n\r\nThe selection of books for a public library is a delicate and responsible\r\nduty, involving wider literary and scientific knowledge than falls to the\r\nlot of most trustees of libraries. There are sometimes specially\r\nqualified professional men or widely read scholars on such boards, whose\r\nservices in recruiting the library are of great value. More frequently\r\nthere are one or more men with hobbies, who would spend the library funds\r\nmuch too freely upon a class of books of no general interest. Thus, one\r\ntrustee who plays golf may urge the purchase of all the various books\r\nupon that game, when one or at most two of the best should supply all\r\nneedful demands. Another may want to add to the library about all the\r\npublished books on the horse; another, who is a physician, may recommend\r\nadding a lot of medical books to the collection, utterly useless to the\r\ngeneral reader. Beware of the man who has a hobby, either as librarian or\r\nas library trustee; he will aim to expend too much money on books which\r\nsuit his own taste, but which have little general utility. Two mischiefs\r\nresult from such a course: the library gets books which very few people\r\nread, and its funds are diverted from buying many books that may be of\r\nprime importance.\r\n\r\nTrustees, although usually, (at least the majority of them) persons of\r\nculture and intelligence, cannot be expected to be bibliographers, nor to\r\nbe familiar with the great range of new books that continually pour from\r\nthe press. They have their own business or profession to engage them, and\r\nare commonly far too busy to study catalogues, or to follow the journals\r\nof the publishing world. So these busy men, charged with the oversight of\r\nthe library interests, call to their aid an expert, and that expert is\r\nthe librarian. It is his interest and his business to know far more than\r\nthey do both of what the library already contains, and what it most\r\nneeds. It is his to peruse the critical journals and reviews, as well as\r\nthe literary notices of the select daily press, and to be prepared to\r\nrecommend what works to purchase. He must always accompany his lists of\r\nwants with the prices, or at least the approximate cost of each, and the\r\naggregate amount. If the trustees or book committee think the sum too\r\nlarge to be voted at any one time from the fund at their disposal, the\r\nlibrarian must know what can best be postponed, as well as what is most\r\nindispensable for the immediate wants of the library. If they object to\r\nany works on the list, he should be prepared to explain the quality and\r\ncharacter of those called in question, and why the library, in his\r\njudgment, should possess them. If the list is largely cut down, and he\r\nconsiders himself hardly used, he should meet the disappointment with\r\nentire good humor, and try again when the members of the committee are in\r\nbetter mood, or funds in better supply.\r\n\r\nIt is very customary for boards of library officers to assume the charge\r\nof the administration so far as regards the library staff, and to make\r\nappointments, promotions or removals at their own pleasure. In most\r\nlibraries, however, this power is exercised mainly on the advice or\r\nselection of the librarian, his action being confirmed when there is no\r\nserious objection. In still other cases, the librarian is left wholly\r\nfree to choose the assistants. This is perhaps the course most likely to\r\nsecure efficient service, since his judgment, if he is a person of tried\r\ncapacity and mature experience, will lead to the selection of the fittest\r\ncandidates, for the work which he alone thoroughly knows. No library\r\ntrustee can put himself fully in the place of a librarian, and see for\r\nhimself the multitude of occasions arising in the daily work of the\r\nlibrary, where promptness, tact, and wide knowledge of books will make a\r\nsuccess, and the want of any of these qualities a failure. Still less can\r\nhe judge the competency or incompetency of one who is to be employed in\r\nthe difficult and exact work of cataloguing books. Besides, there is\r\nalways the hazard that trustees, or some of them, may have personal\r\nfavorites or relatives to prefer, and will use their influence to secure\r\nthe appointment or promotion of utterly uninstructed persons, in place of\r\nsuch candidates as are known to the librarian to be best qualified. In no\r\ncase should any person be employed without full examination as to fitness\r\nfor library work, conducted either by the librarian, or by a committee\r\nof which the librarian is a member or chief examiner. A probationary\r\ntrial should also follow before final appointment.\r\n\r\nThe power of patronage, if unchecked by this safeguard, will result in\r\nfilling any library with incompetents, to the serious detriment of the\r\nservice on which its usefulness depends. The librarian cannot keep a\r\ntraining school for inexperts: he has no time for this, and he\r\nindispensably needs and should have assistants who are competent to their\r\nduties, from their first entrance upon them. As he is held responsible\r\nfor all results, in the conduct of the library, both by the trustees and\r\nby the public, he should have the power, or at least the approximate\r\npower, to select the means by which those results are to be attained.\r\n\r\nIn the Boston Public Library, all appointments are made by the trustees\r\nupon nomination by the librarian, after an examination somewhat similar\r\nto that of the civil service, but by a board of library experts. In the\r\nBritish Museum Library, the selection and promotion of members of the\r\nstaff are passed upon by the trustees, having the recommendation of the\r\nprincipal librarian before them. In the Library of Congress, appointments\r\nare made directly by the librarian after a probationary trial, with\r\nprevious examination as to education, former experience or employments,\r\nattainments, and fitness for library service.\r\n\r\nIn smaller libraries, both in this country and abroad, a great diversity\r\nof usage prevails. Instances are rare in which the librarian has the\r\nuncontrolled power of appointment, promotion and removal. The requirement\r\nof examinations to test the fitness of candidates is extending, and since\r\nthe establishment of five or six permanent schools of library science in\r\nthe United States, with their graduates well equipped for library work,\r\nthere is no longer any excuse for putting novices in charge of\r\nlibraries--institutions where wide knowledge and thorough training are\r\nmore indispensable than in any other profession whatever.\r\n\r\nIn State libraries, no uniformity prevails as to control. In some States,\r\nthe governor has the appointment of the librarian, while in others, he is\r\nan elective officer, the State Legislature being the electors. As\r\ngovernors rarely continue in office longer than two or three years, the\r\ntenure of a librarian under them is precarious, and a most valuable\r\nofficer may at any time be superseded by another who would have to learn\r\nall that the other knows. The result is rarely favorable to the efficient\r\nadministration of the library. In a business absolutely demanding the\r\nvery largest compass of literary and scientific knowledge, frequent\r\nrotation in office is clearly out of place. In a public or State library,\r\nevery added year of experience adds incalculably to the value of a\r\nlibrarian's services, provided he is of active habits, and full of zeal\r\nto make his acquired knowledge constantly useful to those who use the\r\nlibrary. Partizan politics, with their frequent changes, if suffered to\r\ndisplace a tried librarian and staff, will be sure to defeat the highest\r\nusefulness of any library. What can a political appointee, a man totally\r\nwithout either library training or library experience, do with the tools\r\nof which he has never learned the use? It will take him years to learn,\r\nand by the time he has learned, some other political party coming\r\nuppermost will probably displace him, to make room for another novice, on\r\nthe principle that \"to the victors belong the spoils\" of office.\r\nMeanwhile, \"the hungry sheep look up and are not fed,\" as Milton\r\nsings--that is, readers are deprived of expert and intelligent guidance.\r\n\r\nThis bane of political jobbery has not been confined to the libraries of\r\nStates, but has invaded the management of many city and town libraries\r\nalso. We have yet to learn of any benefit resulting to those who use the\r\nlibraries.\r\n\r\nIn the case of a few of the State libraries, trustees or library\r\ncommissioners or boards of control have been provided by law, but in\r\nothers, a joint library committee, composed of members of both houses of\r\nthe Legislature, has charge of the library interests. This is also the\r\ncase in the Library of Congress at Washington, where three Senators and\r\nthree Representatives constitute the Joint Committee of both Houses of\r\nCongress on the Library. The membership of this committee, as of all\r\nothers in Congress, is subject to change biennially. It has been proposed\r\nto secure a more permanent and careful supervision of this National\r\nLibrary by adding to the Joint Committee of Congress three or more\r\ntrustees of eminent qualifications, elected by Congress, as the Regents\r\nof the Smithsonian Institution now are, for a longer term of years. The\r\ntrustees of the British Museum are appointed by the Crown, their tenure\r\nof office being for life.\r\n\r\nIn several States the librarian is appointed by the supreme court, as the\r\nState libraries are composed more largely of law books, than of\r\nmiscellaneous literature, and special knowledge of case law, and the\r\nprinciples of jurisprudence, is demanded of the librarian.\r\n\r\nWhere the trustees of a public library are elected by the people, they\r\nhave in their own hands the power of choosing men who are far above party\r\nconsiderations, and they should exercise it. In no department of life is\r\nthe maxim--\"the tools to the hands that can use them,\" more important\r\nthan in the case of librarians and boards of managers of libraries. The\r\nvalue of skilled labor over the unskilled is everywhere recognized in the\r\nbusiness of the world, by more certain employment and larger\r\ncompensation: and why should it not be so in libraries?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 18.\r\n\r\nLIBRARY REGULATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo feature in library administration is more important than the\r\nregulations under which the service of the library is conducted. Upon\r\ntheir propriety and regular enforcement depends very much of the utility\r\nof the collection.\r\n\r\nRules are of two kinds, those which concern the librarian and assistants,\r\nand those which concern the public resorting to the library. Of the first\r\nclass are the regulations as to hours, division of labor, leaves or\r\nvacations of employees, &c. The larger the library, and consequently the\r\nforce employed, the more important is a careful adjustment of relative\r\nduties, and of the times and seasons to be devoted to them. The\r\nassignment of work to the various assistants will naturally depend upon\r\ntheir respective qualifications. Those who know Latin, and two or more of\r\nthe modern languages, would probably be employed upon the catalogue.\r\nThose who are familiar with the range of books published, in literature\r\nand science, will be best qualified for the service of the reading-room,\r\nwhich involves the supply of books and information. In direct proportion\r\nto the breadth of information possessed by any one, will be his\r\nusefulness in promptly supplying the wants of readers. Nothing is so\r\nsatisfactory to students in libraries, or to the casual seekers of\r\ninformation of any kind, as to find their wants immediately supplied. The\r\nreader whom an intelligent librarian or assistant answers at once is\r\ngrateful to the whole establishment; while the reader who is required to\r\nwait ten to twenty minutes for what he wants, becomes impatient and\r\nsometimes querulous, or leaves the library unsatisfied.\r\n\r\nOne rule of service at the library desk or counter should be that every\r\nassistant there employed should deem it his duty to aid immediately any\r\none who is waiting, no matter what other concerns may engage his\r\nattention. In other words, the one primary rule of a public library\r\nshould be that the service of the public is always paramount. All other\r\nconsiderations should be subordinate to that.\r\n\r\nIt is desirable that assistants in every library should learn all\r\ndepartments of library work, cataloguing, supplying books and\r\ninformation, preparing books for the shelves, etc. This will enable each\r\nassistant to take the place of another in case of absence, a most\r\nimportant point. It will also help to qualify the more expert for\r\npromotion.\r\n\r\nA second rule for internal administration in any library should be that\r\nall books are to be distributed, or replaced upon their shelves, daily.\r\nIf this is not systematically done, the library will tend to fall into\r\nchaos. And even a small number of volumes not in their places will\r\nembarrass the attendants seeking them, and often deprive readers of their\r\nuse--a thing to be always sedulously avoided.\r\n\r\nIn the Library of Congress, the replacement of books upon the shelves is\r\ncarried out much more frequently than once daily. As fast as books come\r\nin at the central desk by the returns of readers, they are sent back\r\nthrough the book-carriers, to the proper floors, where the outside\r\nlabel-numbers indicate that they belong, and replaced by the attendant\r\nthere on their proper shelves. These mechanical book-carriers run all\r\nday, by electric power, supplied by a dynamo in the basement, and, with\r\ntheir endless chain and attached boxes constantly revolving, they furnish\r\na near approach to perpetual motion. Thus I have seen a set of Macaulay's\r\nEngland, called for by ticket from the reading-room, arrive in three\r\nminutes from the outlying book-repository or iron stack, several hundreds\r\nof feet distant on an upper floor, placed on the reader's table,\r\nreferred to, and returned at once, then placed in the book-carrier by the\r\ndesk attendant, received back on its proper floor, and distributed to its\r\nown shelf by the attendant there, all within half an hour after the\r\nreader's application. Another rule to be observed by the reading-room\r\nattendants is to examine all call-slips, or readers' tickets, remaining\r\nuncalled for at the close of each day's business, and see if the books on\r\nthem are present in the library. This precaution is demanded by the\r\nsecurity of the collection, as well as by the good order and arrangement\r\nof the library. Neglect of it may lead to losses or misplacements, which\r\nmight be prevented by careful and unremitting observance of this rule.\r\n\r\nAnother rule of eminent propriety is that librarians or assistants are\r\nnot to read newspapers during library hours. When there happen to be no\r\nreaders waiting to be helped, the time should be constantly occupied with\r\nother library work. There is no library large enough to be worthy of the\r\nname, that does not have arrears of work incessantly waiting to be done.\r\nAnd while this is the case, no library time should be wasted upon\r\nperiodicals, which should be perused only outside of library hours. If\r\none person employed in a library reads the newspaper or magazine, the bad\r\nexample is likely to be followed by others. Thus serious inattention to\r\nthe wants of readers, as well as neglect of library work postponed, will\r\nbe sure to follow.\r\n\r\nA fourth rule, resting upon the same reason, should prevent any long\r\nsustained gossip or conversation during library hours. That time belongs\r\nexplicitly to the public or to the work of the library. The rule of\r\nsilence which is enforced upon the public in the interest of readers\r\nshould not be broken by the library managers themselves. Such brief\r\nquestion and answer as emergency or the needful business of the library\r\nrequires should be conducted in a low tone, and soon ended. Library\r\nadministration is a business, and must be conducted in a business way. No\r\nlibrary can properly be turned into a place of conversation.\r\n\r\nAll differences or disputes between attendants as to the work to be done\r\nby each, or methods, or any other question leading to dissension, should\r\nbe promptly and decisively settled by the librarian, and of course\r\ncheerfully submitted to by all. Good order and discipline require that\r\nthere should be only one final authority in any library. Controversies\r\nare not only unseemly in themselves, but they are time-consuming, and are\r\nliable to be overheard by readers, to the prejudice of those who engage\r\nin them.\r\n\r\nAnother rule to be observed is to examine all books returned, as\r\ncarefully as a glance through the volume will permit, to detect any\r\nmissing or started leaves, or injury to bindings. No volume bearing marks\r\nof dilapidation of any kind should be permitted to go back to the\r\nshelves, or be given to readers, but placed in a bindery reserve for\r\nneedful repairs.\r\n\r\nIt should hardly be necessary to say that all those connected with a\r\npublic library should be carefully observant of hours, and be always in\r\ntheir places, unless excused. The discipline of every library should be\r\nfirm in this respect, and dilatory or tardy assistants brought to regard\r\nthe rule of prompt and regular service. \"No absence without leave\" should\r\nbe mentally posted in the consciousness and the conscience of every one.\r\n\r\nAnother rule should limit the time for mid-day refreshment, and so\r\narrange it that the various persons employed go at different hours. As to\r\ntime employed, half-an-hour for lunch, as allowed in the Washington\r\ndepartments, is long enough in any library.\r\n\r\nFurloughs or vacations should be regulated to suit the library service,\r\nand not allow several to be absent at the same time. As to length of\r\nvacation time, few libraries can afford the very liberal fashion of\r\ntwelve months wages for eleven months work, as prevalent in the\r\nWashington Departments. The average vacation time of business\r\nhouses--about two weeks--more nearly corresponds to that allowed in the\r\nsmaller public libraries. Out of 173 libraries reporting in 1893, 61\r\nallowed four weeks or more vacation, 27 three weeks, 54 two weeks, and 31\r\nnone. But in cases of actual illness, the rule of liberality should be\r\nfollowed, and no deduction of wages should follow temporary disability.\r\n\r\nWhere many library attendants are employed, all should be required to\r\nenter on a daily record sheet or book, the hour of beginning work. Then\r\nthe rule of no absence without special leave should be enforced as to all\r\nduring the day.\r\n\r\nWe now come to such rules of library administration as concern the\r\nreaders, or the public. The rule of silence, or total abstinence from\r\nloud talking, should be laid down and enforced. This is essential for the\r\nprotection of every reader from annoyance or interruption in his\r\npursuits. The rule should be printed on all readers' tickets, and it is\r\nwell also to post the word SILENCE, in large letters, in two or more\r\nconspicuous places in the reading-room. This will give a continual\r\nreminder to all of what is expected, and will usually prevent any loud\r\nconversation. While absolute silence is impossible in any public library,\r\nthe inquiries and answers at the desk can always be made in a low and\r\neven tone, which need attract no attention from any readers, if removed\r\nonly a few feet distant. As there are always persons among readers who\r\nwill talk, notwithstanding rules, they should be checked by a courteous\r\nreminder from the librarian, rather than from any subordinate. This--for\r\nthe obvious reason that admonition from the highest authority carries the\r\ngreatest weight.\r\n\r\nAnother rule, which should always be printed on the call-slips, or\r\nreaders' tickets, is the requirement to return books and receive back\r\ntheir tickets always before leaving the library. This duty is very\r\ncommonly neglected, from the utter carelessness of many readers, who do\r\nnot realize that signing their ticket for any book holds them responsible\r\nfor it until it is returned. Many are unwilling to spend a moment's time\r\nin waiting for a ticket to be returned to them. Many will leave their\r\nbooks on tables or seats where they were reading, and go away without\r\nreclaiming their receipts. While complete observance of this rule is of\r\ncourse hopeless of attainment in a country where free and easy manners\r\nprevail, every librarian should endeavor to secure at least an\r\napproximate compliance with a rule adopted alike for the security and\r\ngood order of the library, and the efficient service of the reader.\r\n\r\nAll readers should be privileged to reserve books from day to day which\r\nthey have not completed the use of, and instructed always to give notice\r\nof such reservation before leaving the library. This saves much time,\r\nboth to the reader and to the librarian in sending repeatedly for books\r\nput away needlessly.\r\n\r\nIn a circulating library, a fixed rule limiting the time for which a book\r\nmay be kept, is essential. This may be from three days to two weeks,\r\naccording to the demand for the book, but it should not exceed the latter\r\nperiod. Still, a renewal term may be conceded, provided the book is not\r\notherwise called for. A small fine of so much a day for each volume kept\r\nout beyond the time prescribed by the rule, will often secure prompt\r\nreturn, and is the usage in most libraries where books are lent out. In\r\nthe Boston Public Library no renewals are allowed. A rule requiring the\r\nreplacement or repair of books damaged while in the hands of a reader\r\nshould be printed and enforced. It may properly be waived where the\r\ndamage is slight or unavoidable.\r\n\r\nIn public circulating libraries, a rule of registration is required, and\r\nin some libraries of reference also; but in the Library of Congress all\r\nreaders over sixteen are admitted without any formality or registration\r\nwhatever.\r\n\r\nIn popular libraries, the need of a registry list of those entitled to\r\nborrow books, is obvious, to prevent the issue to improper or\r\nunauthorized persons; as, for example, residents of another town, or\r\npersons under the prescribed age of admission to library privileges. A\r\nprinted library card should be issued to each person privileged to draw\r\nbooks; corresponding in number to the page or index-card of the library\r\nrecord. Each card should bear the full name and address of the applicant,\r\nand be signed with an obligation to obey the rules of the library. On\r\nthis card all books drawn may be entered, always with month and day date,\r\nand credited with date of return, the parallel entries being at the same\r\ntime made in the library charging record.\r\n\r\nLibrary cards of registration should be issued for a limited period, say\r\ntwelve months, in order to bring all persons to a systematic review of\r\ntheir privilege, and should be renewed annually, so long as the holder is\r\nentitled to registration. No books should be issued except to those\r\npresenting registration cards, together with a call-slip or ticket for\r\nthe book wanted.\r\n\r\nAnother rule should fix a limit to the number of volumes to be drawn by\r\nany reader. Two volumes out at any one time would be a fair limit. If\r\nmade more to all readers, there is likely to be sometimes a scarcity of\r\nbooks to be drawn upon; and if a few readers are permitted to draw more\r\nthan others, the charge of undue favoritism will be justified.\r\n\r\nAnother rule should be that any incivility or neglect on the part of any\r\nlibrary attendant should be reported to the librarian. In such cases, the\r\nattendant should always be heard, before any admonition or censure is\r\nbestowed.\r\n\r\nAn almost necessary rule in most libraries is that no book should be\r\ntaken from the shelves by any person not employed in the library. The\r\nexceptions are of course, the books provided expressly for the free and\r\nopen reference of the readers.\r\n\r\nAnother essential rule is that no writing or marks may be made in any\r\nlibrary book or periodical; nor is any turning down of leaves permitted.\r\nA printed warning is important to the effect that any cutting or defacing\r\nof library books or periodicals is a penal offense, and will be\r\nprosecuted according to law.\r\n\r\nThe regulations for admission to library privileges are important. In\r\nthis country the age limitation is more liberal than in Europe. The\r\nBoston Public Library, for example, is free to all persons over twelve\r\nyears of age. In the Library of Congress, the age limit is sixteen years\r\nor upward, to entitle one to the privileges of a reader. In the Astor\r\nLibrary, none are admitted under nineteen, and in the British Museum\r\nLibrary none below twenty-one years.\r\n\r\nThe hours during which the library is open should be printed as part of\r\nthe regulations.\r\n\r\nAll the library rules should be printed and furnished to the public. The\r\nmost essential of them, if carefully expressed in few words, can be\r\ngrouped in a single small sheet, of 16mo. size or less, and pasted in the\r\ninside cover of every book belonging to the library. Better still, (and\r\nit will save expense in printing) let the few simple rules, in small but\r\nlegible type, form a part of the book plate, or library label, which goes\r\non the left-hand inner cover of each volume. Thus every reader will have\r\nbefore him, in daily prominence, the regulations which he is to observe,\r\nand no excuse can be pleaded of ignorance of the rules.\r\n\r\nAs no law is ever long respected unless it is enforced, so no regulations\r\nare likely to be observed unless adhered to in every library. Rules are a\r\nmost essential part of library administration, and it should be a primary\r\nobject of every librarian or assistant to see that they are observed by\r\nall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 19.\r\n\r\nLIBRARY REPORTS AND ADVERTISING.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe now come to consider the annual reports of librarians. These should be\r\nmade to the trustees or board of library control, by whatever name it may\r\nbe known, and should be addressed to the chairman, as the organ of the\r\nboard. In the preparation of such reports, two conditions are equally\r\nessential--conciseness and comprehensiveness. Every item in the\r\nadministration, frequentation, and increase of the library should be\r\nseparately treated, but each should be condensed into the smallest\r\ncompass consistent with clear statement. Very long reports are costly to\r\npublish, and moreover, have small chance of being read. In fact, the wide\r\nperusal of any report is in direct proportion to its brevity.\r\n\r\nThis being premised, let us see what topics the librarian's report should\r\ndeal with.\r\n\r\n1. The progress of the library during the year must be viewed as most\r\nimportant. A statistical statement of accessions, giving volumes of\r\nbooks, and number of pamphlets separately, added during the year, should\r\nbe followed by a statement of the aggregate of volumes and pamphlets in\r\nthe collection. This is ascertained by actual count of the books upon the\r\nshelves, adding the number of volumes charged out, or in the bindery, or\r\nin readers' hands at the time of the enumeration. This count is far from\r\na difficult or time-consuming affair, as there is a short-hand method of\r\ncounting by which one person can easily arrive at the aggregate of a\r\nlibrary of 100,000 volumes, in a single day of eight to ten hours. This\r\nis done by counting by twos or threes the rows of books as they stand on\r\nthe shelves, passing the finger rapidly along the backs, from left to\r\nright and from top to bottom of the shelves. As fast as one hundred\r\nvolumes are counted, simply write down a figure one; then, at the end of\r\nthe second hundred, a figure two, and so on, always jotting down one\r\nfigure the more for each hundred books counted. The last figure in the\r\ncounter's memorandum will represent the number of hundreds of volumes the\r\nlibrary contains. Thus, if the last figure is 92, the library has just\r\n9,200 volumes. This rapid, and at the same time accurate method, by which\r\nany one of average quickness can easily count two hundred volumes a\r\nminute, saves all counting up by tallies of five or ten, and also all\r\nslow additions of figures, since one figure at the end multiplied by one\r\nhundred, expresses the whole.\r\n\r\n2. Any specially noteworthy additions to the library should be briefly\r\nspecified.\r\n\r\n3. A list of donors of books during the year, with number of volumes\r\ngiven by each, should form part of the report. This may properly come at\r\nthe end as an appendix.\r\n\r\n4. A brief of the money income of the year, with sources whence derived,\r\nand of all expenditures, for books, salaries, contingent expenses, etc.,\r\nshould form a part of the report, unless reported separately by a\r\ntreasurer of the library funds.\r\n\r\n5. The statistics of a librarian's report, if of a lending library,\r\nshould give the aggregate number of volumes circulated during the year,\r\nalso the number of borrowers recorded who have used and who have not used\r\nthe privilege of borrowing. The number of volumes used by readers in the\r\nreference or reading-room department should be given, as well as the\r\naggregate of readers. It is usual in some library reports to classify the\r\nbooks used by readers, as, so many in history, poetry, travels, natural\r\nscience, etc., but this involves labor and time quite out of proportion\r\nto its utility. Still, a comparative statement of the aggregate volumes\r\nof fiction read or drawn out, as against all other books, may be highly\r\nuseful as an object lesson, if embodied in the library report.\r\n\r\n6. A statement of the actual condition of the library, as to books,\r\nshelving accommodations, furniture, etc., with any needful suggestions\r\nfor improvement, should be included in the annual report.\r\n\r\n7. A well-considered suggestion of the value of contributions to the\r\nlibrary in books or funds to enrich the collection, should not be\r\noverlooked.\r\n\r\n8. The librarian should not forget a word of praise for his assistants,\r\nin the great and useful work of carrying on the library. This will tend\r\nto excite added zeal to excel, when the subordinates feel that their\r\nservices are appreciated by their head, as well as by the public.\r\n\r\nThe preparation of an annual report affords some test of the librarian's\r\nskill and judgment. It should aim at plain and careful statement, and all\r\nrhetoric should be dispensed with. Divided into proper heads, a condensed\r\nstatement of facts or suggestions under each should be made, and all\r\nrepetition avoided.\r\n\r\nSuch a library report should never fail to set forth the great benefit to\r\nthe community which a free use of its treasures implies, while urging the\r\nimportance of building up the collection, through liberal gifts of books,\r\nperiodicals, or money, thus enabling it to answer the wants of readers\r\nmore fully, year by year. It will sometimes be a wise suggestion to be\r\nmade in a librarian's report, that the library still lacks some specially\r\nimportant work, such as Larned's \"History for Ready Reference,\" or the\r\nextensive \"Dictionary of National Biography,\" or Brunet's _Manuel du\r\nLibraire_, or a set of Congressional Debates from the beginning; and such\r\na suggestion may often bear fruit in leading some public-spirited citizen\r\nto supply the want by a timely contribution.\r\n\r\nOf course, the annual report of every public library should be printed,\r\nand as pamphlets are seldom read, and tend rapidly to disappear, its\r\npublication in the newspapers is vastly more important than in any other\r\nform. While a pamphlet report may reach a few people, the newspaper\r\nreaches nearly all; and as a means of diffusing information in any\r\ncommunity, it stands absolutely without rival. Whether the library\r\nreports shall be printed in pamphlet form or not is a matter of\r\nexpediency, to be determined by the managing board. Funds are rarely\r\nample enough, in the smaller town libraries, to justify the expense, in\r\nview of the small circulation which such reports receive, and it is much\r\nbetter to put the money into printing library catalogues, which every\r\nbody needs and will use, than into library reports, which comparatively\r\nfew will make any use of. A judicious compromise may be usefully made, by\r\ninducing some newspaper, which would print a liberal share of the report\r\nfree of charge, as news, for public information, to put the whole in type\r\nand strike off a few hundred copies in sheet form or pages, at a moderate\r\ncharge.\r\n\r\nThis would enable the library officers to distribute a goodly number, and\r\nto keep copies of each annual report for reference, without the expense\r\nof a pamphlet edition.\r\n\r\nIn some of the larger and more enterprising of city libraries, reports\r\nare made quarterly or monthly by the librarian. These of course are much\r\nmore nearly up to date, and if they publish lists of books added to the\r\nlibrary, they are correspondingly useful. Frequently they contain special\r\nbibliographies of books on certain subjects. Among these, the monthly\r\nbulletins of the Boston Public Library, Harvard University Library, New\r\nYork Public Library, Salem, Mass., Public Library, and the Providence\r\nPublic Library are specially numerous and important.\r\n\r\nThe relations of a public library to the local press of the city or town\r\nwhere it is situated will now be noticed. It is the interest of the\r\nlibrarian to extend the usefulness of the library by every means; and the\r\nmost effective means is to make it widely known. In every place are found\r\nmany who are quite ignorant of the stores of knowledge which lie at their\r\ndoors in the free library. And among those who do know it and resort to\r\nit, are many who need to have their interest and attention aroused by\r\nfrequent notices as to its progress, recent additions to its stores, etc.\r\nThe more often the library is brought before the public by the press, the\r\nmore interest will be taken in it by the community for whose information\r\nit exists.\r\n\r\nIt is of the utmost importance that the library conductors should have\r\nthe active good will of all the newspaper editors in its vicinity. This\r\nwill be acquired both by aiding them in all researches which the daily or\r\nfrequent wants of their profession render necessary; and also, by giving\r\nthem freely and often items of intelligence about the library for\r\npublication. Enterprising journals are perpetually on the hunt for new\r\nand varied matter to fill their columns. They send their reporters to the\r\nlibrary to make \"a story,\" as it is called, out of something in it or\r\nabout it. These reporters are very seldom persons versed in books, or\r\nable to write understandingly or attractively about them. Left to\r\nthemselves to construct \"a story\" out of a half hour's conversation with\r\nthe librarian, the chances are that an article will be produced which\r\ncontains nearly as many errors as matters of fact, with the names of\r\nauthors or the titles of their books mis-spelled or altered, and with\r\nmatters manufactured out of the reporter's fancy which formed no part of\r\nthe interview, while what did form important features in it are perhaps\r\nomitted. The remedy, or rather the preventive of such inadequate reports\r\nof what the librarian would say to the public is to become his own\r\nreporter. The papers will willingly take for publication short \"library\r\nnotes,\" as they may be called, containing information about the library\r\nor its books, carefully type-written. This course at once secures\r\naccurate and authentic statements, and saves the time of the press\r\nreporters for other work.\r\n\r\nBear in mind always that the main object of such library notices is to\r\nattract attention, and encourage people to use the library. Thus there\r\nshould be sought frequent opportunities of advertising the library by\r\nthis best of all possible means, because it is the one which reaches the\r\nlargest number. To do it well requires some skill and practice, and to do\r\nit often is quite as essential as to do it well. Keep the library\r\ncontinually before the public. What are the business houses which are\r\nmost thronged with customers? They are those that advertise most\r\npersistently and attractively. So with the library; it will be more and\r\nmore resorted to, in proportion as it keeps its name and its riches\r\nbefore the public eye.\r\n\r\nA certain timeliness in these library notices should be cultivated. The\r\npapers are eager to get anything that illustrates what is uppermost in\r\nthe public mind. If a local fair is in progress or preparing, give them a\r\nlist of the best books the library has in that field; the history of the\r\nPhiladelphia Exposition, the Chicago World's Fair, the Paris Expositions,\r\n&c. On another day, set forth the books on manufactures, horses, cattle,\r\ndomestic animals, decorative art, &c. If there is a poultry exhibition,\r\nor a dog show, call public attention to the books on poultry or dogs. If\r\nan art exhibition, bring forward the titles of books on painting,\r\nsculpture, drawing, and the history of art, ancient and modern.\r\n\r\nIf some great man has died, as Bismarck or Gladstone, give the titles of\r\nany biographies or books about him, adding even references to notable\r\nmagazine articles that have appeared. When the summer vacation is coming\r\naround, advertise your best books of travel, of summer resorts, of ocean\r\nvoyages, of yachting, camping, fishing and shooting, golf and other\r\nout-door games, etc. If there is a Presidential campaign raging, make\r\nknown the library's riches in political science, the history of\r\nadministrations, and of nominating conventions, lives of the Presidents,\r\nbooks on elections, etc. If an international dispute or complication is\r\non foot, publish the titles of your books on international law, and those\r\non the history or resources of the country or countries involved; and\r\nwhen a war is in progress, books on military science, campaigns, battles,\r\nsieges, and the history of the contending nations will be timely and\r\ninteresting.\r\n\r\nWhatever you do in this direction, make it short and attractive. Organize\r\nyour material, describe a specially interesting work by a reference to\r\nits style, or its illustrations, or its reputation, etc. Distribute your\r\nlibrary notes impartially; that is, if several papers are published, be\r\ncareful not to slight any of them. Find out the proper days to suit their\r\nwant of matter, and never send in your notes when the paper is\r\novercrowded. Always read a proof-slip of each article; time spent in\r\ngoing to a newspaper office to correct proof is well spent, for misprints\r\nalways await the unwary who trusts to the accuracy of types.\r\n\r\nIf the library acquires any extensive or notable book, whether old or\r\nnew, do not fail to make it known through the press. If any citizen gives\r\na number of volumes to the library, let his good deeds have an\r\nappreciative notice, that others may go and do likewise.\r\n\r\nAnother feature of library advertising is the publication in the press of\r\nthe titles of new books added to the library. As this is merely catalogue\r\nprinting, however abbreviated in form the titles may be, it will usually\r\n(and very properly) be charged for by the newspapers. But it will pay, in\r\nthe direction of inducing a much larger use of the library, and as the\r\nsole object of the institution is to contribute to public intelligence,\r\nit becomes library managers not to spare any expense so conducive to that\r\nresult.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 20.\r\n\r\nTHE FORMATION OF LIBRARIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the widely extended and growing public interest in libraries for the\r\npeople, and in the ever increasing gatherings of books by private\r\ncollectors, I may be pardoned for some suggestions pertaining specially\r\nto the formation of libraries. I do not refer to the selection of books,\r\nwhich is treated in the first chapter, nor to the housing and care of\r\nlibraries, but to some important points involved in organizing the\r\nfoundation, so to speak, of a library.\r\n\r\nThe problem, of course, is a widely different one for the private\r\ncollector of an individual or family library, and for the organizers of a\r\npublic one. But in either case, it is important, first of all, to have a\r\nclearly defined and well considered plan. Without this, costly mistakes\r\nare apt to be made, and time, energy and money wasted, all of which might\r\nbe saved by seeing the end from the beginning, and planning accordingly.\r\n\r\nLet us suppose that a resident in a community which has never enjoyed the\r\nbenefit of a circulating library conceives the idea of using every means\r\nto secure one. The first question that arises is, what are those means?\r\nIf the State in which his residence lies has a Library law, empowering\r\nany town or city to raise money by taxation for founding and maintaining\r\na free library, the way is apparently easy, at first sight. But here\r\ncomes in the problem--can the requisite authority to lay the tax be\r\nsecured? This may involve difficulties unforeseen at first. If there is a\r\ncity charter, does it empower the municipal authorities (city council or\r\naldermen) to levy such a tax? If not, then appeal must be made to a\r\npopular vote, at some election of municipal officers, at which the\r\nballots for or against a Library tax should determine the question. This\r\nwill at once involve a campaign of education, in which should be enlisted\r\n(1) The editors of all the local papers. (2) The local clergymen, lawyers\r\nand physicians. (3) All literary men and citizens of wealth or influence\r\nin the community. (4) All teachers in the public schools and other\r\ninstitutions of learning. (5) The members of the city or town government.\r\nThese last will be apt to feel any impulse of public sentiment more\r\nkeenly than their own individual opinions on the subject. In any case,\r\nthe public-spirited man who originates the movement should enlist as many\r\nable coadjutors as he can. If he is not himself gifted with a ready\r\ntongue, he should persuade some others who are ready and eloquent talkers\r\nto take up the cause, and should inspire them with his own zeal. A public\r\nmeeting should be called, after a goodly number of well-known and\r\ninfluential people are enlisted (not before) and addresses should be\r\nmade, setting forth the great advantage of a free library to every\r\nfamily. Its value to educate the people, to furnish entertainment that\r\nwill go far to supplant idleness and intemperance, to help on the work of\r\nthe public schools, and to elevate the taste, improve the morals, quicken\r\nthe intellect and employ the leisure hours of all, should be set forth.\r\n\r\nWith all these means of persuasion constantly in exercise, and\r\nunremitting diligence in pushing the good cause through the press and by\r\nevery private opportunity, up to the very day of the election, the\r\nchances are heavily in favor of passing the library measure by a good\r\nmajority. It must be a truly Boeotian community, far gone in stupidity\r\nor something worse, which would so stand in its own light as to vote down\r\na measure conducing in the highest degree to the public intelligence.\r\nBut even should it be defeated, its advocates should never be\r\ndiscouraged. Like all other reforms or improvements, its progress may be\r\nslow at first, but it is none the less sure to win in the end. One defeat\r\nhas often led to a more complete victory when the conflict is renewed.\r\nThe beaten party gathers wisdom by experience, finds out any weakness\r\nexisting in its ranks or its management, and becomes sensible where its\r\ngreatest strength should be put forth in a renewal of the contest. The\r\npromoters of the measure should at once begin a fresh agitation. They\r\nshould pledge every friend of the library scheme to stand by it himself,\r\nand to secure at least one new convert to the cause. And the chances are\r\nthat it will be carried triumphantly through at the next trial, or, if\r\nnot then, at least within no long time.\r\n\r\nBut we should consider also the case of those communities where no State\r\nLibrary law exists. These are unhappily not a few; and it is a remarkable\r\nfact that even so old, and rich, and well-developed a State as\r\nPennsylvania had no such provision for public enlightenment until within\r\nthree years. In the absence of a law empowering local governments or\r\nvoters to lay a tax for such a purpose, the most obvious way of founding\r\na library is by local subscription. This is of course a less desirable\r\nmethod than one by which all citizens should contribute to the object in\r\nproportion to their means. But it is better to avail of the means that\r\nexist in any place than to wait an indefinite period for a State\r\nLegislature to be educated up to the point of passing measures which\r\nwould render the formation of libraries easy in all places.\r\n\r\nLet the experiment be tried of founding a library by individual effort\r\nand concert. With only two or three zealous and active promoters, even\r\nsuch a plan can be carried into successful operation in almost any\r\ncommunity. A canvass should be made from house to house, with a short\r\nprospectus or agreement drawn up, pledging the subscribers to give a\r\ncertain sum toward the foundation of a library. If a few residents with\r\nlarge property can be induced to head the list with liberal\r\nsubscriptions, it will aid much in securing confidence in the success of\r\nthe movement, and inducing others to subscribe. No contributions, however\r\nsmall, should fail to be welcomed, since they stand for a wider interest\r\nin the object. After a thorough canvass of the residents of the place, a\r\nmeeting of those subscribing should be called, and a statement put before\r\nthem of the amount subscribed. Then an executive committee, say of three\r\nor five members, should be chosen to take charge of the enterprise. This\r\ncommittee should appoint a chairman, a secretary, and a treasurer, the\r\nlatter to receive and disburse the funds subscribed. The chairman should\r\ncall and preside at meetings of the committee, of which the secretary\r\nshould record the proceedings in a book kept for the purpose.\r\n\r\nThe first business of the Library committee should be to confer and\r\ndetermine upon the ways and means of organizing the library. This\r\ninvolves a selection of books suitable for a beginning, a place of\r\ndeposit for them, and a custodian or librarian to catalogue them and keep\r\nthe record of the books drawn out and returned. Usually, a room can be\r\nhad for library purposes in some public building or private house,\r\ncentrally located, without other expense than that of warming and\r\nlighting. The services of a librarian, too, can often be secured by\r\ncompetent volunteer aid, there being usually highly intelligent persons\r\nwith sufficient leisure to give their time for the common benefit, or to\r\nshare that duty with others, thus saving all the funds for books to\r\nenrich the library.\r\n\r\nThe chief trouble likely to be encountered by a Library committee will\r\nlie in the selection of books to form the nucleus or starting point of\r\nthe collection. Without repeating anything heretofore suggested, it may\r\nbe said that great care should be taken to have books known to be\r\nexcellent, both interesting in substance and attractive in style. To so\r\napportion the moderate amount of money at disposal as to give variety and\r\ninterest to the collection, and attract readers from the start, is a\r\nproblem requiring good judgment for its solution. Much depends upon the\r\nextent of the fund, but even with so small a sum as two or three hundred\r\ndollars, a collection of the very best historians, poets, essayists,\r\ntravellers and voyagers, scientists, and novelists can be brought\r\ntogether, which will furnish a range of entertaining and instructive\r\nreading for several hundred borrowers. The costlier encyclopaedias and\r\nworks of reference might be waited for until funds are recruited by a\r\nlibrary fair, or lectures, or amateur concerts, plays, or other evening\r\nentertainments.\r\n\r\nAnother way of recruiting the library which has often proved fruitful is\r\nto solicit contributions of books and magazines from families and\r\nindividuals in the vicinity. This should be undertaken systematically\r\nsome time after the subscriptions in money have been gathered in. It is\r\nnot good policy to aim at such donations at the outset, since many might\r\nmake them an excuse for not subscribing to the fund for founding the\r\nlibrary, which it is to the interest of all to make as large as possible.\r\nBut when once successfully established, appeals for books and periodicals\r\nwill surely add largely to the collection, and although many of such\r\naccessions may be duplicates, they will none the less enlarge the\r\nfacilities for supplying the demands of readers. Families who have read\r\nthrough all or nearly all the books they possess will gladly bestow them\r\nfor so useful a purpose, especially when assured of reaping reciprocal\r\nbenefit by the opportunity of freely perusing a great variety of choice\r\nbooks, new and old, which they have never read. Sometimes, too, a\r\npublic-spirited citizen, when advised of the lack of a good cyclopaedia,\r\nor of the latest extensive dictionary, or collective biography, in the\r\nlibrary, will be happy to supply it, thereby winning the gratitude and\r\ngood will of all who frequent the library. All donations should have\r\ninserted in them a neat book-plate, with the name of the donor inscribed,\r\nin connection with the name of the Library.\r\n\r\nMany a useful library of circulation has been started with a beginning of\r\nfifty to a hundred volumes, and the little acorn of learning thus planted\r\nhas grown up in the course of years to a great tree, full of fruitful and\r\nwide-spreading branches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 21.\r\n\r\nCLASSIFICATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf there is any subject which, more than all others, divides opinion and\r\nprovokes endless controversy among librarians and scholars, it is the\r\nproper classification of books. From the beginning of literature this has\r\nbeen a well-nigh insoluble problem. Treatise after treatise has been\r\nwritten upon it, system has been piled upon system, learned men have\r\ntheorised and wrangled about it all their lives, and successive\r\ngenerations have dropped into their graves, leaving the vexed question as\r\nunsettled as ever. Every now and then a body of _savans_ or a convention\r\nof librarians wrestles with it, and perhaps votes upon it,\r\n\r\n    \"And by decision more embroils the fray\"\r\n\r\nsince the dissatisfied minority, nearly as numerous and quite as\r\nobstinate as the majority, always refuses to be bound by it. No sooner\r\ndoes some sapient librarian, with the sublime confidence of conviction,\r\nget his classification house of cards constructed to his mind, and stands\r\nrapt in admiration before it, when there comes along some wise man of the\r\neast, and demolishes the fair edifice at a blow, while the architect\r\nstands by with a melancholy smile, and sees all his household gods lying\r\nshivered around him.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, systems of classification keep on growing, until, instead of\r\nthe thirty-two systems so elaborately described in Edwards's Memoirs of\r\nLibraries, we have almost as many as there are libraries, if the endless\r\nmodifications of them are taken into account. In fact, one begins to\r\nrealise that the schemes for the classification of knowledge are becoming\r\nso numerous, that a classification of the systems themselves has fairly\r\nbecome a desideratum. The youthful neophyte, who is struggling after an\r\neducation in library science, and thinks perhaps that it is or should be\r\nan exact science, is bewildered by the multitude of counsellors, gets a\r\nhead-ache over their conflicting systems, and adds to it a heart-ache,\r\nperhaps, over the animosities and sarcasms which divide the warring\r\nschools of opinion.\r\n\r\nPerhaps there would be less trouble about classification, if the\r\nsystem-mongers would consent to admit at the outset that no infallible\r\nsystem is possible, and would endeavor, amid all their other learning, to\r\nlearn a little of the saving grace of modesty. A writer upon this subject\r\nhas well observed that there is no man who can work out a scheme of\r\nclassification that will satisfy permanently even himself. Much less\r\nshould he expect that others, all having their favorite ideas and\r\nsystems, should be satisfied with his. As there is no royal road to\r\nlearning, so there can be none to classification; and we democratic\r\nrepublicans, who stand upon the threshold of the twentieth century, may\r\nrest satisfied that in the Republic of Letters no autocrat can be\r\nallowed.\r\n\r\nThe chief difficulty with most systems for distributing the books in a\r\nlibrary appears to lie in the attempt to apply scientific minuteness in a\r\nregion where it is largely inapplicable. One can divide and sub-divide\r\nthe literature of any science indefinitely, in a list of subjects, but\r\nsuch exhaustive sub-divisions can never be made among the books on the\r\nshelves. Here, for example, is a \"Treatise on diseases of the heart and\r\nlungs.\" This falls naturally into its two places in the subject\r\ncatalogue, the one under \"Heart,\" and the second under \"Lungs;\" but the\r\nattempt to classify it on the shelves must fail, as regards half its\r\ncontents. You cannot tear the book to pieces to satisfy logical\r\nclassification. Thousands of similar cases will occur, where the same\r\nbook treats of several subjects. Nearly all periodicals and transactions\r\nof societies of every kind refuse to be classified, though they can be\r\ncatalogued perfectly on paper by analysing their contents. To bring all\r\nthe resources of the library on any subject together on the shelves is\r\nclearly impossible. They must be assembled for readers from various\r\nsections of the library, where the rule of analogy or of superior\r\nconvenience has placed them.\r\n\r\nWhat is termed close classification, it will be found, fails by\r\nattempting too much. One of the chief obstacles to its general use is\r\nthat it involves a too complicated notation. The many letters and figures\r\nthat indicate position on the shelves are difficult to remember in the\r\ndirect ratio of their number. The more minute the classification, the\r\nmore signs of location are required. When they become very numerous, in\r\nany system of classification, the system breaks down by its own weight.\r\nLibrary attendants consume an undue amount of time in learning it, and\r\nlibrary cataloguers and classifiers in affixing the requisite signs of\r\ndesignation to the labels, the shelves, and the catalogues. Memory, too,\r\nis unduly taxed to apply the system. While a superior memory may be found\r\nequal to any task imposed upon it, average memories are not so fortunate.\r\nThe expert librarian, in whose accomplished head the whole world of\r\nscience and literature lies coördinated, so that he can apply his\r\nclassification unerringly to all the books in a vast library, must not\r\npresume that unskilled assistants can do the same.\r\n\r\nOne of the mistakes made by the positivists in classification is the\r\nclaim that their favorite system can be applied to all libraries alike.\r\nThat this is a fallacy may be seen in an example or two. Take the case of\r\na large and comprehensive Botanical library, in which an exact scientific\r\ndistribution of the books may and should be made. It is classified not\r\nonly in the grand divisions, such as scientific and economic botany,\r\netc., but a close analytical treatment is extended over the whole\r\nvegetable kingdom. Books treating of every plant are relegated to their\r\nappropriate classes, genera, and species, until the whole library is\r\norganised on a strictly scientific basis. But in the case, even of what\r\nare called large libraries, so minute a classification would be not only\r\nunnecessary, but even obstructive to prompt service of the books. And the\r\naverage town library, containing only a shelf or two of botanical works,\r\nclearly has no use for such a classification. The attempt to impose a\r\nuniversal law upon library arrangement, while the conditions of the\r\ncollections are endlessly varied, is foredoomed to failure.\r\n\r\nThe object of classification is to bring order out of confusion, and to\r\narrange the great mass of books in science and literature of which every\r\nlibrary is composed, so that those on related subjects should be as\r\nnearly as possible brought together. Let us suppose a collection of some\r\nhundred thousand volumes, in all branches of human knowledge, thrown\r\ntogether without any classification or catalogue, on the tables, the\r\nshelves, and the floor of an extensive reading-room. Suppose also an\r\nassemblage of scholars and other readers, ready and anxious to avail\r\nthemselves of these literary treasures, this immense library without a\r\nkey. Each wants some certain book, by some author whose name he knows, or\r\nupon some subject upon which he seeks to inform himself. But how vain and\r\nhopeless the effort to go through all this chaos of learning, to find the\r\none volume which he needs! This illustration points the prime necessity\r\nof classification of some kind, before a collection of books can be used\r\nin an available way.\r\n\r\nThen comes in the skilled bibliographer, to convert this chaos into a\r\ncosmos, to illumine this darkness with the light of science. He\r\ndistributes the whole mass, volume by volume, into a few great distinct\r\nclasses; he creates families or sub-divisions in every class; he\r\nassembles together in groups all that treat of the same subject, or any\r\nof its branches; and thus the entire scattered multitude of volumes is at\r\nlength coördinated into a clear and systematic collection, ready for use\r\nin every department. A great library is like a great army: when\r\nunorganized, your army is a mere undisciplined mob: but divide and\r\nsub-divide it into army corps, divisions, brigades, regiments, and\r\ncompanies, and you can put your finger upon every man.\r\n\r\nTo make this complete organization of a library successful, one must have\r\nan organising mind, a wide acquaintance with literature, history, and the\r\noutlines, at least, of all the sciences; a knowledge of the ancient and\r\nof various modern languages; a quick intuition, a ripe judgment, a\r\ncultivated taste, a retentive memory, and a patience and perseverance\r\nthat are inexhaustible.\r\n\r\nEven were all these qualities possessed, there will be in the arrangement\r\nelements of discord and of a failure. A multitude of uncertain points in\r\nclassification, and many exceptions will arise; and these must of\r\nnecessity be settled arbitrarily. The more conversant one becomes with\r\nsystems of classification, when reduced to practice, the more he becomes\r\nassured that a perfect bibliographical system is impossible.\r\n\r\nEvery system of classification must find its application fraught with\r\ndoubts, complications, and difficulties; but the wise bibliographer will\r\nnot pause in his work to resolve all these insoluble problems; he will\r\nclassify the book in hand according to his best judgment at the moment it\r\ncomes before him. He can no more afford to spend time over intricate\r\nquestions of the preponderance of this, that, or the other subject in a\r\nbook, than a man about to walk to a certain place can afford to debate\r\nwhether he shall put his right foot forward or his left. The one thing\r\nneedful is to go forward.\r\n\r\nReferring to the chapter on bibliography for other details, I may here\r\nsay that the French claim to have reached a highly practical system of\r\nclassification in that set forth in J. C. Brunet's _Manuel du Libraire_.\r\nThis is now generally used in the arrangement of collections of books in\r\nFrance, with some modifications, and the book trade find it so well\r\nadapted to their wants, that classified sale and auction catalogues are\r\nmostly arranged on that system. It has only five grand divisions:\r\nTheology, Law, Arts and Sciences, Belles-lettres, and History. Each of\r\nthese classes has numerous sub-divisions. For example, geography and\r\nvoyages and travels form a division of history, between the philosophy of\r\nhistory and chronology, etc.\r\n\r\nThe classification in use in the _Bibliothèque nationale_ of France\r\nplaces Theology first, followed by Law, History, Philosophy and\r\nBelles-lettres. The grand division of Philosophy includes all which is\r\nclassified under Arts and Sciences in the system of Brunet.\r\n\r\nIn the Library of the British Museum the classification starts with\r\nTheology, followed by 2. Jurisprudence; 3. Natural History (including\r\nBotany, Geology, Zoölogy, and Medicine); 4. Art (including Archaeology,\r\nFine Arts, Architecture, Music, and Useful Arts); 5. Philosophy\r\n(including Politics, Economics, Sociology, Education, Ethics,\r\nMetaphysics, Mathematics, Military and Naval Science, and Chemistry); 6.\r\nHistory (including Heraldry and Genealogy); 7. Geography (including\r\nEthnology); 8. Biography (including Epistles); 9. Belles-lettres\r\n(including Poetry, Drama, Rhetoric, Criticism, Bibliography, Collected\r\nWorks, Encyclopaedias, Speeches, Proverbs, Anecdotes, Satirical and\r\nfacetious works, Essays, Folklore and Fiction); 10. Philology.\r\n\r\nSub-divisions by countries are introduced in nearly all the classes.\r\n\r\nIn the Library of Congress the classification was originally based upon\r\nLord Bacon's scheme for the division of knowledge into three great\r\nclasses, according to the faculty of the mind employed in each. 1.\r\nHistory (based upon memory); 2. Philosophy (based upon reason); 3. Poetry\r\n(based upon imagination). This scheme was much better adapted to a\r\nclassification of ideas than of books. Its failure to answer the ends of\r\na practical classification of the library led to radical modifications of\r\nthe plan, as applied to the books on the shelves, for reasons of logical\r\narrangement, as well as of convenience. A more thorough and systematic\r\nre-arrangement is now in progress.\r\n\r\nMr. C. A. Cutter has devised a system of \"Expansive classification,\" now\r\nwidely used in American libraries. In this, the classes are each\r\nindicated by a single letter, followed by numbers representing divisions\r\nby countries, and these in turn by letters indicating sub-divisions by\r\nsubjects, etc. It is claimed that this method is not a rigid unchangeable\r\nsystem, but adaptable in a high degree, and capable of modification to\r\nsuit the special wants of any library. In it the whole range of\r\nliterature and science is divided into several grand classes, which, with\r\ntheir sub-classes, are indicated by the twenty-six letters of the\r\nalphabet. Thus Class A embraces Generalia; B to D, Spiritual sciences\r\n(including philosophy and religion); E to G, Historical sciences\r\n(including, besides history and biography, geography and travels); H to\r\nK, Social sciences (including law and political science and economics); L\r\nto P, Natural sciences; Q, Medicine; and R to Z, Arts (including not only\r\nmechanical, recreative and fine arts, but music, languages, literature,\r\nand bibliography).\r\n\r\nThe sub-divisions of these principal classes are arranged with\r\nprogressive fullness, to suit smaller or larger libraries. Thus, the\r\nfirst classification provides only eleven classes, suited to very small\r\nlibraries: the second is expanded to fifteen classes, the third to thirty\r\nclasses, and so on up to the seventh or final one, designed to provide\r\nfor the arrangement of the very largest libraries.\r\n\r\nThis is the most elaborate and far-reaching library classification yet\r\nput forth, claiming superior clearness, flexibility, brevity of notation,\r\nlogical coördination, etc., while objections have been freely made to it\r\non the score of over-refinement and aiming at the unattainable.\r\n\r\nWhat is known as the decimal or the Dewey system of classification was\r\noriginally suggested by Mr. N. B. Shurtleff's \"Decimal system for the\r\narrangement and administration of libraries,\" published at Boston in\r\n1856. But in its present form it has been developed by Mr. Melvil Dewey\r\ninto a most ingenious scheme for distributing the whole vast range of\r\nhuman knowledge into ten classes, marked from 0 to 9, each of which\r\nsub-divides into exactly ten sub-classes, all divisible in their turn\r\ninto ten minor divisions, and so on until the material in hand, or the\r\ningenuity of the classifier is exhausted. The notation of the books on\r\nthe shelves corresponds to these divisions and sub-divisions. The claims\r\nof this system, which has been quite extensively followed in the smaller\r\nAmerican libraries, and in many European ones, are economy, simplicity,\r\nbrevity of notation, expansibility, unchanging call-numbers, etc. It has\r\nbeen criticised as too mechanical, as illogical in arrangement of\r\nclasses, as presenting many incongruities in its divisions, as\r\nprocrustean, as wholly inadequate in its classification of jurisprudence,\r\netc. It is partially used by librarians who have had to introduce radical\r\nchanges in portions of the classification, and in fact it is understood\r\nthat the classification has been very largely made over both in Amherst\r\nCollege library and in that of Columbia University, N. Y., where it was\r\nfully established.\r\n\r\nThis only adds to the cumulative proofs that library classification\r\ncannot be made an exact science, but is in its nature indefinitely\r\nprogressive and improvable. Its main object is not to classify knowledge,\r\nbut books. There being multitudes of books that do not belong absolutely\r\nto any one class, all classification of them is necessarily a compromise.\r\nNearly all the classification schemers have made over their schemes--some\r\nof them many times. I am not arguing against classification, which is\r\nessential to the practical utility of any library. An imperfect\r\nclassification is much better than none: but the tendency to erect\r\nclassification into a fetish, and to lay down cast-iron rules for it,\r\nshould be guarded against. In any library, reasons of convenience must\r\noften prevail over logical arrangement; and he who spends time due to\r\nprompt library service in worrying over errors in a catalogue, or vexing\r\nhis soul at a faulty classification, is as mistaken as those fussy\r\nindividuals who fancy that they are personally responsible for the\r\nobliquity of the earth's axis.\r\n\r\nIt may be added that in the American Library Association's Catalogue of\r\n5,000 books for a popular library, Washington, 1893, the classification\r\nis given both on the Dewey (Decimal) system, and on the Cutter expansive\r\nsystem, so that all may take their choice.\r\n\r\nThe fixed location system of arrangement, by which every book is assigned\r\nby its number to one definite shelf, is objectionable as preventing\r\naccessions from being placed with their cognate books. This is of such\r\ncardinal importance in every library, that a more elastic system of some\r\nkind should be adopted, to save continual re-numbering. No system which\r\nmakes mere arithmetical progression a substitute for intrinsic qualities\r\ncan long prove satisfactory.\r\n\r\nThe relative or movable location on shelves is now more generally adopted\r\nthan the old plan of numbering every shelf and assigning a fixed location\r\nto every volume on that shelf. The book-marks, if designating simply the\r\nrelative order of the volumes, permit the books to be moved along, as\r\naccessions come in, from shelf to shelf, as the latter become crowded.\r\nThis does not derange the numbers, since the order of succession is\r\nobserved.\r\n\r\nFor small town libraries no elaborate system of classification can\r\nproperly be attempted. Here, the most convenient grouping is apt to prove\r\nthe best, because books are most readily found by it. Mr. W. I. Fletcher\r\nhas outlined a scheme for libraries of 10,000 volumes or less, as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nA. Fiction (appended, J. Juvenile books); B. English and American\r\nliterature; C. History; D. Biography; E. Travels; F. Science; G. Useful\r\narts; H. Fine and recreative arts; I. Political and social science; K.\r\nPhilosophy and religion; L. Works on language and in foreign languages;\r\nR. Reference books.\r\n\r\nNumerous sub-divisions would be required to make such a scheme (or indeed\r\nany other) fit any collection of books.\r\n\r\nIn arranging the main classes, care should be taken to bring those most\r\ndrawn upon near to the delivery desk, or charging system of the library.\r\n\r\nThe alphabet is usefully applied in the arrangement of several of the\r\ngreat classes of books, and in many sub-divisions of other classes. Thus,\r\nall English and American fiction may be arranged in a single alphabet of\r\nauthors, including English translations of foreign works. All collected\r\nworks, or polygraphy, may form an alphabet, as well as poetry, dramatic\r\nworks, collections of letters, and miscellanea, arranged by authors'\r\nnames. In any of these classes, sub-divisions by languages may be made,\r\nif desired.\r\n\r\nThe class biography may best be arranged in an alphabet of the subjects\r\nof the biographies, rather than of writers, for obvious reasons of\r\nconvenience in finding at once the books about each person.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 22.\r\n\r\nCATALOGUES.\r\n\r\n\r\nCatalogues of libraries are useful to readers in direct proportion to\r\ntheir fulfilment of three conditions: (1) Quick and ready reference. (2)\r\nArranging all authors' names in an alphabet, followed by titles of their\r\nworks. (3) Subjects or titles in their alphabetical order in the same\r\nalphabet as the authors. This is what is known as a \"Dictionary\r\ncatalogue\"; but why is it preferable to any other? Because it answers\r\nmore questions in less time than any other.\r\n\r\nThe more prevalent styles of catalogues have been, 1. A list of authors,\r\nwith titles of their works under each. 2. A catalogue of subjects, in a\r\nclassified topical or alphabetical order, the authors and their works\r\nbeing grouped under each head. 3. A catalogue attempting to combine these\r\ntwo, by appending to the author-catalogue a classed list of subjects,\r\nwith a brief of authors under each, referring to the page on which the\r\ntitles of their works may be found; or else, 4. Appending to the\r\nsubject-catalogue an alphabet of authors, with similar references to\r\npages under subjects.\r\n\r\nEach of these methods of catalogue-making, while very useful, contrives\r\nto miss the highest utility, which lies in enabling the reader to put his\r\nfinger on the book he wants, at one glance of the eye. The catalogue of\r\nauthors will not help him to subjects, nor will the catalogue of\r\nsubjects, as a rule, give the authors and titles with the fullness that\r\nmay be needed. In either case, a double reference becomes necessary,\r\nconsuming just twice the time, and in a two-column catalogue, three\r\ntimes the time required in a dictionary catalogue.\r\n\r\nThe reader who wants Darwin's \"Origin of Species\" finds it readily enough\r\nby the author-catalogue; but he wants, at the same time, to find other\r\nworks on the same subject, and all the author-catalogues in the world\r\nwill not help him to them. But give him a dictionary catalogue, and he\r\nhas, in the same alphabet with his Darwin, (if the library is large)\r\ndozens of books discussing the theory of that great naturalist, under\r\nspecies, evolution, Darwinism, etc.\r\n\r\nThus he finds that there is no key which so quickly unlocks the stores of\r\nknowledge which a library contains, as a dictionary catalogue.\r\n\r\nThe objections to it are chiefly brought by minds schooled in systems,\r\nwho look askance on all innovations, and instinctively prefer round-about\r\nmethods to short-hand ones.\r\n\r\nAsk such an objector if he would prefer his dictionary of the English\r\nlanguage arranged, not alphabetically, but subjectively, so that all\r\nmedical terms should be defined only under medicine, all species of fish\r\ndescribed only under fishes, etc., and he will probably say that there is\r\nno analogy in the case. But the analogy becomes apparent when we find, in\r\nwhat are called systematic catalogues, no two systems alike, and the\r\nfinding of books complicated by endless varieties of classification, with\r\nno common alphabet to simplify the search. The authors of systems\r\ndoubtless understand them themselves, but no one else does, until he\r\ndevotes time to learn the key to them; and even when learned, the\r\nknowledge is not worth the time lost in acquiring it, since the field\r\ncovered in any one catalogue is so small. Alphabetical arrangement, on\r\nthe other hand, strictly adhered to, is a universal key to the authors\r\nand subjects and titles of all the books contained in the library it\r\nrepresents. The devotee of a bibliographical system may be as mistaken as\r\nthe slave of a scientific terminology. He forgets that bibliography is\r\nnot a school for teaching all departments of knowledge, but a brief and\r\nhandy index to books that may contain that knowledge. A student who has\r\nonce made a thorough comparative test of the merits, as aids to wide and\r\nrapid research, of the old-fashioned bibliographies and the best modern\r\ndictionary catalogues, will no more deny the superiority of the latter,\r\nthan he will contest the maxim that a straight line is the nearest road\r\nbetween two points. Meantime, \"while doctors disagree, disciples are\r\nfree;\" and the disciples who would follow the latest guides in the art\r\n\"how to make and use a catalogue,\" must get rid of many formulas.\r\n\r\nThe reader will find in the chapter on bibliography, notes on some\r\nclasses of catalogues, with the more notable examples of them. We are\r\nhere concerned with the true method of preparing catalogues, and such\r\nplain rules as brevity will permit to be given, will be equally adapted\r\nto private or public libraries. For more ample treatment, with reasons\r\nfor and against many rules laid down, reference is made to the able and\r\nacute work, \"Rules for a Dictionary Catalogue,\" by C. A. Cutter,\r\npublished by the U. S. Bureau of Education, 3d ed. 1891.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONDENSED RULES FOR AN AUTHOR AND TITLE CATALOGUE.\r\n\r\n_Prepared by the Co-operation Committee of the American Library\r\nAssociation._\r\n\r\n                 ENTRY.\r\n\r\n     Books are to be entered under the:\r\n\r\n     Surnames of authors when ascertained, the abbreviation \"_Anon._\"\r\n     being added to the titles of anonymous works.\r\n\r\n     Initials of authors' names when these only are known, the last\r\n     initial being put first.\r\n\r\n     Pseudonyms of the writers when the real names are not\r\n     ascertained.\r\n\r\n     Names of editors of collections, each separate item to be at the\r\n     same time sufficiently catalogued under its own heading.\r\n\r\n     Names of countries, cities, societies, or other bodies which are\r\n     responsible for their publication.\r\n\r\n     First word (not an article or serial number) of the titles of\r\n     periodicals and of anonymous books, the names of whose authors\r\n     are not known. And a motto or the designation of a series may be\r\n     neglected when it begins a title, and the entry may be made under\r\n     the first word of the real title following.\r\n\r\n     Commentaries accompanying a text, and translations, are to be\r\n     entered under the heading of the original work; but commentaries\r\n     without the text under the name of the commentator. A book\r\n     entitled \"Commentary on ....\" and containing the text, should be\r\n     put under both.\r\n\r\n     The Bible, or any part of it (including the Apocrypha), in any\r\n     language, is to be entered under the word Bible.\r\n\r\n     The Talmud and Koran (and parts of them) are to be entered under\r\n     those words; the sacred books of other religions are to be\r\n     entered under the names by which they are generally known;\r\n     references to be given from the names of editors, translators,\r\n     etc.\r\n\r\n     The respondent or defender of an academical thesis is to be\r\n     considered as the author, unless the work unequivocally appears\r\n     to be the work of the _praeses_.\r\n\r\n     Books having more than one author to be entered under the one\r\n     first named in the title, with a reference from each of the\r\n     others.\r\n\r\n     Reports of civil actions are to be entered under the name of the\r\n     party to the suit which stands first on the title page. Reports\r\n     of crown and criminal proceedings are to be entered under the\r\n     name of the defendant. Admiralty proceedings relating to vessels\r\n     are to be put under the name of the vessel.\r\n\r\n     Noblemen are to be entered under their titles, unless the family\r\n     name is decidedly better known.\r\n\r\n     Ecclesiastical dignitaries, unless popes or sovereigns, are to be\r\n     entered under their surnames.\r\n\r\n     Sovereigns (other than Greek or Roman), ruling princes, Oriental\r\n     writers, popes, friars, persons canonized, and all other persons\r\n     known _only_ by their first name, are to be entered under this\r\n     first name.\r\n\r\n     Married women, and other persons who have changed their names,\r\n     are to be put under the last well-known form.\r\n\r\n     A pseudonym may be used instead of the surname (and only a\r\n     reference to the pseudonym made under the surname) when an author\r\n     is much more known by his false than by his real name. In case of\r\n     doubt, use the real name.\r\n\r\n     A society is to be entered under the first word, not an article,\r\n     of its corporate name, with references from any other name by\r\n     which it is known, especially from the name of the place where\r\n     its headquarters are established, if it is often called by that\r\n     name.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 REFERENCES.\r\n\r\n     When an author has been known by more than one name, references\r\n     should be inserted from the name or names not to be used as\r\n     headings to the one used.\r\n\r\n     References are also to be made to the headings chosen:\r\n       asked for by their titles;\r\n\r\n       from other striking titles;\r\n\r\n       from noticeable words in anonymous titles, especially from the\r\n       names of subjects of anonymous biographies;\r\n\r\n       from the names of editors of periodicals, when the periodicals are\r\n       generally called by the editor's name;\r\n\r\n       from the names of important translators (especially poetic\r\n       translators) and commentators;\r\n\r\n       from the title of an ecclesiastical dignitary, when that, and not\r\n       the family name, is used in the book catalogued;\r\n\r\n       and in other cases where a reference is needed to insure the ready\r\n       finding of the book.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 HEADINGS.\r\n\r\n     In the heading of titles, the names of authors are to be given in\r\n     full, and in their vernacular form, except that the Latin form\r\n     may be used when it is more generally known, the vernacular form\r\n     being added in parentheses; except, also, that sovereigns and\r\n     popes may be given in the English form.\r\n\r\n     English and French surnames beginning with a prefix (except the\r\n     French de and d') are to be recorded under the prefix; in other\r\n     languages under the word following.\r\n\r\n     English compound surnames are to be entered under the last part\r\n     of the name; foreign ones under the first part.\r\n\r\n     Designations are to be added to distinguish writers of the same\r\n     name from each other.\r\n\r\n     Prefixes indicating the rank or profession of writers may be\r\n     added in the heading, when they are part of the usual designation\r\n     of the writers.\r\n\r\n     Names of places to be given in the English form. When both an\r\n     English and a vernacular form are used in English works, prefer\r\n     the vernacular.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 TITLES.\r\n\r\n     The title is to be an exact transcript of the title-page, neither\r\n     amended, translated, nor in any way altered, except that mottos,\r\n     titles of authors, repetitions, and matter of any kind not\r\n     essential, are to be omitted. Where great accuracy is desirable,\r\n     omissions are to be indicated by three dots (...). The titles of\r\n     books especially valuable for antiquity or rarity may be given in\r\n     full, with all practicable precision. The phraseology and\r\n     spelling, but not necessarily the punctuation, of the title are\r\n     to be exactly copied.\r\n\r\n     Any additions needed to make the title clear are to be supplied,\r\n     and inclosed by brackets.\r\n\r\n     Initial capitals are to be given in English:\r\n       noted events, and periods (each separate word not an article,\r\n       conjunction, or preposition, may be capitalized in these cases);\r\n\r\n       to adjectives and other derivatives from proper names when they\r\n       have a direct reference to the person, place, etc., from which\r\n       they are derived;\r\n\r\n       to the first word of every sentence and of every quoted title;\r\n\r\n       to titles of honor when standing instead of a proper name\r\n       (_e. g._, the Earl of Derby, but John Stanley, earl of Derby);\r\n\r\n       In foreign languages, according to the local usage;\r\n\r\n       In doubtful cases capitals are to be avoided.\r\n\r\n     Foreign languages.--Titles in foreign characters may be\r\n     transliterated. The languages in which a book is written are to be\r\n     stated when there are several, and the fact is not apparent from the\r\n     title.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 IMPRINTS.\r\n\r\n     After the title are to be given, in the following order, those in\r\n     [ ] being optional:\r\n\r\n       the place of publication;\r\n\r\n       [and the publisher's name] (these three in the language of\r\n       the title);\r\n\r\n       the year as given on the title-page, but in Arabic figures;\r\n\r\n       [the year of copyright or actual publication, if known to be\r\n       different in brackets, and preceded by c. or p. as the case may be];\r\n\r\n       the number of volumes, or of pages if there is only one volume;\r\n\r\n       [the number of maps, portraits, or illustrations not included in the\r\n       text];\r\n\r\n       and either the approximate size designated by letter, or the\r\n       exact size in centimeters;\r\n\r\n       the name of the series to which the book belongs is to be given in\r\n       parentheses after the other imprint entries.\r\n\r\n     After the place of publication, the place of printing may be\r\n     given if different. This is desirable only in rare and old books.\r\n\r\n     The number of pages is to be indicated by giving the last number\r\n     of each paging, connecting the numbers by the sign +; the\r\n     addition of unpaged matter may be shown by a +, or the number of\r\n     pages ascertained by counting may be given in brackets. When\r\n     there are more than three pagings, it is better to add them\r\n     together and give the sum in brackets.\r\n\r\n     These imprint entries are to give the facts, whether ascertained\r\n     from the book or from other sources; those which are usually\r\n     taken from the title (edition, place, publisher's name, and\r\n     series) should be in the language of the title, corrections and\r\n     additions being inclosed in brackets. It is better to give the\r\n     words, \"maps,\" \"portraits,\" etc., and the abbreviations for\r\n     \"volumes\" and \"pages,\" in English.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 CONTENTS, NOTES.\r\n\r\n     Notes (in English) and contents of volumes are to be given when\r\n     necessary to properly describe the works. Both notes and lists of\r\n     contents to be in a smaller type.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 MISCELLANEOUS.\r\n\r\n     A single dash or indent indicates the omission of the preceding\r\n     heading; a subsequent dash or indent indicates the omission of a\r\n     subordinate heading, or of a title.\r\n\r\n     A dash connecting numbers signifies to and including; following a\r\n     number it signifies continuation.\r\n\r\n     A ? following a word or entry signifies probably.\r\n\r\n     Brackets inclose words added to titles or imprints, or changed in\r\n     form.\r\n\r\n     Arabic figures are to be used rather than Roman; but small\r\n     capitals may be used after the names of sovereigns, princes, and\r\n     popes.\r\n\r\n     A list of abbreviations to be used was given in the Library\r\n     journal, Vol. 3: 16-20.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 ARRANGEMENT.\r\n\r\n     The surname when used alone precedes the same name used with\r\n     forenames; where the initials only of the forenames are given,\r\n     they are to precede fully written forenames beginning with the\r\n     same initials (_e. g._, Brown, Brown, J.; Brown, J. L.; Brown,\r\n     James).\r\n\r\n     The prefixes M and Mc, S., St., Ste., Messrs., Mr., and Mrs., are\r\n     to be arranged as if written in full, Mac, Sanctus, Saint,\r\n     Sainte, Messieurs, Mister, and Mistress.\r\n\r\n     The works of an author are to be arranged in the following order:\r\n\r\n       2. Partial collections.\r\n\r\n       3. Single works, alphabetically, by the first word of the title.\r\n\r\n     The order of alphabeting is to be that of the English alphabet.\r\n\r\n     The German ae, oe, ue, are always to be written as ä, ö, ü, and\r\n     arranged as a, o, u.\r\n\r\n     Names of persons are to precede similar names of places, which in turn\r\n     precede similar first words of titles.\r\n\r\nA few desirable modifications or additions to these rules may be\r\nsuggested.\r\n\r\n1. In title-entries, let the year of publication stand last, instead of\r\nthe indication of size.\r\n\r\n2. Noblemen to be entered under their family names, with reference from\r\ntheir titles.\r\n\r\n3. Instead of designations of title, profession, residence, or family, to\r\ndistinguish authors, let every name be followed by the chronology, as--\r\n\r\n    James (Henry) 1811-82.\r\n    James (Henry) 1843-\r\n\r\nIt is highly desirable to give this information as to the author's period\r\nin every title-heading, without exception, when ascertainable. If\r\nunknown, the approximate period to be given, with a query.\r\n\r\n4. All titles to be written in small letters, and printed in lower case,\r\nwhether in English, German, or any other language, avoiding capitals\r\nexcept in cases named in the rule.\r\n\r\n5. Works without date, when the exact date is not found, are to be\r\ndescribed conjecturally, thus:\r\n\r\n    [1690?] or [about 1840.]\r\n\r\n6. In expressing collations, use commas rather than the sign + between\r\nthe pagings, as--xvi, 452, vii pp.--not xvi+452+vii pp.\r\n\r\n7. Forenames should be separated from the surnames which precede them by\r\nparenthesis rather than commas, as a clearer discrimination: as--\r\n\r\n    Alembert (Jean Baptiste le Rond d')--not\r\n    Alembert, Jean Baptiste le Rond d'.\r\n\r\nThe printed catalogue of the British Museum Library follows this method,\r\nas well as that in the preceding paragraph.\r\n\r\n8. All books of history, travels, or voyages to have the period covered\r\nby them inserted in brackets, when not expressed in the title-page.\r\n\r\n9. All collected works of authors, and all libraries or collections of\r\ndifferent works to be analysed by giving the contents of each volume,\r\neither in order of volumes, or alphabetically by authors' names.\r\n\r\nOf course there are multitudes of points in catalogue practice not\r\nprovided for in the necessarily brief summary preceding: and, as books on\r\nthe art abound, the writer gives only such space to it as justice to the\r\nwide range of library topics here treated permits.\r\n\r\nProbably the most important question in preparing catalogue titles, is\r\nwhat space to give to the author's frequently long-drawn-out verbiage in\r\nhis title-page. There are two extremes to be considered: (1) Copying the\r\ntitle literally and in full, however prolix; and (2) reducing all\r\ntitle-pages, by a Procrustean rule, to what we may call \"one-line\r\ntitles.\" Take an example:\r\n\r\n\"Jones (Richard T.) A theoretical and practical treatise on the benefits\r\nof agriculture to mankind. With an appendix containing many useful\r\nreflections derived from practical experience. iv, 389 pp. 8°. London,\r\nMDCCXLIV.\" As abridged to a short title, this would read: \"Jones (Richard\r\nT.) Benefits of agriculture, iv, 389 pp. 8°. Lond. 1744.\" Who will say\r\nthat the last form of title does not convey substantially all that is\r\nsignificant of the book, stripped of superfluous verbiage? But we need\r\nnot insist upon titles crowded into a single line of the catalogue,\r\nwhether written or printed. This would do violence to the actual scope of\r\nmany books, by suppressing some significant or important part of their\r\ntitles. The rule should be to give in the briefest words selected out of\r\nthe title (never imported into it) the essential character of the book,\r\nso far as the author has expressed it. Take another example:\r\n\r\n\"Bowman (Thomas) A new, easy, and complete Hebrew course; containing a\r\nHebrew grammar, with copious Hebrew and English exercises, strictly\r\ngraduated: also, a Hebrew-English and English-Hebrew lexicon. In two\r\nparts. Part I. Regular verbs. Edinburgh, 1879.\"\r\n\r\nThis might be usefully condensed thus:\r\n\r\n     Bowman, (Thomas) Hebrew course: grammar, exercises, lexicon,\r\n     [&c.] Part I. Regular verbs. Edinburgh, 1879.\r\n\r\nOne objection brought against the dictionary catalogue is that it widely\r\nseparates subjects that belong together. In the Boston Athenaeum\r\ncatalogue, for example, the topic Banks is found in Vol. 1, while Money\r\nis in Vol. 3; and for Wages, one must go to Vol. 5, while Labor is in\r\nVol. 3. But there are two valid reasons for this. First, the reader who\r\nwants to know about banks or wages may care nothing about the larger\r\ntopics of money or of labor; and secondly, if he does want them, he is\r\nsent to them at once by cross-reference, where they belong in the\r\nalphabet; whereas, if they were grouped under Political Economy, as in\r\nclassed catalogues, he must hunt for them through a maze of unrelated\r\nbooks, without any alphabet at all.\r\n\r\nIt is often forgotten by the advocates of systematic subject catalogues\r\nrather than alphabetical ones, that catalogues are for those who do not\r\nknow, more than for those who do. The order of the alphabet is settled\r\nand familiar; but no classification by subjects is either familiar or\r\nsettled. Catalogues should aim at the greatest convenience of the\r\ngreatest number of readers.\r\n\r\nIt is noteworthy that the English Catalogue (the one national\r\nbibliography of the current literature of that country) has adopted,\r\nsince 1891, the dictionary form of recording authors, titles and subjects\r\nin one alphabet, distinguishing authors' names by antique type. It is\r\nhoped that the American Catalogue, an indispensable work in all\r\nlibraries, will adopt in its annual and quinquennial issues the\r\ntime-saving method of a single alphabet.\r\n\r\nIt is not claimed that the dictionary catalogue possesses fully all the\r\nadvantages in educating readers that the best classed catalogues embody.\r\nBut the chief end of catalogues being to find books promptly, rather than\r\nto educate readers, the fact that the dictionary catalogue, though far\r\nfrom perfect, comes nearer to the true object than any other system,\r\nweighs heavily in its favor. Edward Edwards said--\"Many a reader has\r\nspent whole days in book-hunting [in catalogues] which ought to have been\r\nspent in book-reading.\" It is to save this wasted time that catalogues\r\nshould aim.\r\n\r\nNothing can be easier than to make a poor catalogue, while nothing is\r\nmore difficult than to make a good one. The most expert French\r\nbibliographers who have distinguished themselves by compiling catalogues\r\nhave been most severely criticised by writers who no doubt would have\r\nbeen victimized in their turn if they had undertaken similar work. Byron\r\nsays\r\n\r\n    \"A man must serve his time to every trade,\r\n     Save censure;--critics all are ready made.\"\r\n\r\nWhen De Bure and Van Praet, most accomplished bibliographers, published\r\nthe catalogue of the precious library of the duke de La Vallière, the\r\nabbé Rive boasted that he had discovered a blunder in every one of the\r\nfive thousand titles of their catalogue. Barbier and Brunet have both\r\nbeen criticised for swarms of errors in the earlier editions of their\r\nfamous catalogues. The task of the exact cataloguer is full of\r\ndifficulty, constantly renewed, and demanding almost encyclopaedic\r\nknowledge, and incessant care of minute particulars.\r\n\r\nThe liability to error is so great in a kind of work which, more than\r\nalmost any other, demands the most scrupulous accuracy, lest a catalogue\r\nshould record a book with such mistakes as to completely mislead a\r\nreader, that rules are imperatively necessary. And whatever rules are\r\nadopted, a rigid adherence to them is no less essential, to avoid\r\nmisapprehension and confusion. A singular instance of imperfect and\r\nmisleading catalogue work was unwittingly furnished by Mr. J. Payne\r\nCollier, a noted English critic, author, and librarian, who criticised\r\nthe slow progress of the British Museum catalogue, saying that he could\r\nhimself do \"twenty-five titles an hour without trouble.\" His twenty-five\r\ntitles when examined, were found to contain almost every possible error\r\nthat can be made in cataloguing books. These included using names of\r\ntranslators or editors as headings, when the author's name was on the\r\ntitle-page; omitting christian names of authors; omitting to specify the\r\nedition; using English instead of foreign words to give the titles of\r\nforeign books; adopting titled instead of family names for authors (which\r\nwould separate Stanhope's \"England under Queen Anne\" from the same\r\nwriter's \"History of England,\" published when he was Lord Mahon); errors\r\nin grammar, etc. These ridiculous blunders of a twenty-five-title-an-hour\r\nman exemplify the maxim \"the more haste, the worse speed,\" in\r\ncatalogue-making.\r\n\r\nThat our British brethren are neither adapted nor inclined to pose as\r\nexemplars in the fine art of cataloguing, we need only cite their own\r\nself-criticisms to prove. Here are two confessions found in two authors\r\nof books on catalogue-making, both Englishmen. Says one: \"We are\r\ndeficient in good bibliographies. It is a standing disgrace to the\r\ncountry that we have no complete bibliography of English authors, much\r\nless of English literature generally.\" Says another: \"The English are a\r\nsupremely illogical people. The disposition to irregularity has made\r\nEnglish bibliography, or work on catalogues, a by-word among those who\r\ngive attention to these matters.\"\r\n\r\nAn American may well add, \"They do these things better in France and\r\nGermany,\" while declining to claim the meed of superiority for the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nToo much prominence should not be given to place-numbers in library\r\ncatalogues. The tendency to substitute mere numerical signs for authors\r\nand subjects has been carried so far in some libraries, that books are\r\ncalled for and charged by class-numbers only, instead of their\r\ndistinctive names. An English librarian testifies that assistants trained\r\nin such libraries are generally the most ignorant of literature. When\r\nmechanical or mnemonical signs are wholly substituted for ideas and for\r\nauthors, is it any wonder that persons incessantly using them become\r\nmechanical? Let catalogue and classification go hand in hand in bringing\r\nall related books together, and library assistants will not stunt their\r\nintellects by becoming bond-slaves to the nine digits, nor lose the power\r\nof thought and reflection by never growing out of their _a b c's_.\r\n\r\nThere are two forms of catalogue not here discussed, which are adjuncts\r\nto the library catalogue proper. The accession catalogue, kept in a large\r\nvolume, records the particulars regarding every volume, on its receipt by\r\nthe library. It gives author, title, date, size, binding, whence\r\nacquired, cost, etc., and assigns it an accession number, which it ever\r\nafter retains. The shelf catalogue (or shelf-list) is a portable one\r\ndivided into sections representing the cases of shelves in the library.\r\nIt gives the shelf classification number, author, brief title and number\r\nof volumes of each book, as arranged on the shelves; thus constituting an\r\ninventory of each case, or stack, throughout the library.\r\n\r\nTo check a library over is to take an account of stock of all the books\r\nit should contain. This is done annually in some libraries, and the\r\ndeficiencies reported. All libraries lose some books, however few, and\r\nthese losses will be small or great according to the care exercised and\r\nthe safe-guards provided. The method is to take one division of the\r\nlibrary at a time, and check off all books on the shelves by their\r\nnumbers on the shelf-list, supplemented by careful examination of all\r\nnumbers drawn out, or at bindery, or in other parts of the library. Not a\r\nvolume should be absent unaccounted for. Those found missing after a\r\ncertain time should be noted on the shelf-list and accession book, and\r\nreplaced, if important, after the loss is definitely assured.\r\n\r\nThe reason for writing and printing all catalogue titles in small\r\nletters, without capitals (except for proper names) is two-fold. First,\r\nthere can be no standard prescribing what words should or should not be\r\ncapitalized, and the cataloguer will be constantly at a loss, or will use\r\ncapitals in the most unprincipled way. He will write one day, perhaps,\r\n\"The Dangers of great Cities,\" and the next, \"The dangers of Great\r\ncities\"--with no controlling reason for either form. Secondly, the\r\nsymmetry of a title or a sentence, whether written or printed, is best\r\nattained by the uniform exclusion of capitals. That this should be\r\napplied to all languages, notwithstanding the habit of most German\r\ntypographers of printing all nouns with capitals, is borne out by no less\r\nan authority than the new Grimm's _Deutsches Wörterbuch_, which prints\r\nall words in \"lower case\" type except proper names. Nothing can be more\r\nunsightly than the constant breaking up of the harmony of a line by the\r\ncapricious use of capitals.\r\n\r\nTo discriminate carefully the various editions of each work is part of\r\nthe necessary duty of the cataloguer. Many books have passed through\r\nseveral editions, and as these are by no means always specified on the\r\ntitle-page, one should establish the sequence, if possible, by other\r\nmeans. The first edition is one which includes all copies printed from\r\nthe plates or the type as first set; the second, one which is reprinted,\r\nwith or without changes in the text or the title. First editions often\r\nacquire a greatly enhanced value, in the case of a noted author, by\r\nreason of changes made in the text in later issues of the work. For\r\nthough the latest revision may and should be the author's best improved\r\nexpression, his earliest furnishes food for the hunters of literary\r\ncuriosities. Every catalogue should distinguish first editions thus [1st\r\ned.] in brackets.\r\n\r\nIn the arrangement of titles in catalogues, either of the various works\r\nof the same writer, or of many books on the same subject, some compilers\r\nfollow the alphabetical order, while others prefer the chronological--or\r\nthe order of years of publication of the various works. The latter has\r\nthe advantage of showing the reader the earlier as distinguished from the\r\nrecent literature, but in a long sequence of authors (in a\r\nsubject-catalogue) it is more difficult to find a given writer's work, or\r\nto detect its absence.\r\n\r\nThe task of accurately distributing the titles in a catalogue of subjects\r\nwould be much simplified, if the books were all properly named. But it is\r\nan unhappy failing of many writers to give fanciful or far-fetched titles\r\nto their books, so that, instead of a descriptive name, they have names\r\nthat describe nothing. This adds indefinitely to the labor of the\r\ncataloguer, who must spend time to analyse to some extent the contents of\r\nthe book, before he can classify it. This must be done to avoid what may\r\nbe gross errors in the catalogue. Familiar examples are Ruskin's Notes on\r\nSheep-folds (an ecclesiastical criticism) classified under Agriculture;\r\nand Edgeworth's Irish Bulls under Domestic animals.\r\n\r\nThe work of alphabeting a large number of title-cards is much simplified\r\nand abbreviated by observing certain obvious rules in the distribution.\r\n(1) Gather in the same pile all the cards in the first letter of the\r\nalphabet, A, followed in successive parallel rows by all the B's, and so\r\non, to the letter Z. (2) Next, pursue the same course with all the\r\ntitles, arranging under the second letter of the alphabet, Aa, Ab, Ac,\r\netc., and so with all the cards under B. C. &c. for all the letters. (3)\r\nIf there still remain a great many titles to distribute into a closer\r\nalphabetic sequence, the third operation will consist in arranging under\r\nthe third letter of the alphabet, _e. g._, Abb, Abc, Abd, etc. The same\r\nmethod is pursued throughout the entire alphabet, until all the\r\ntitle-cards are arranged in strict order.\r\n\r\nToo much care cannot be taken to distinguish between books written by\r\ndifferent authors, but bearing the same name. Many catalogues are full of\r\nerrors in this respect, attributing, for example, works written by\r\nJonathan Edwards, the younger, (1745-1801) to Jonathan Edwards the elder,\r\n(1703-58); or cataloguing under Henry James, Jr., the works of his\r\nfather, Henry James. The abundant means of identification which exist\r\nshould cause such errors to be avoided; and when the true authorship is\r\nfixed, every author's chronology should appear next after his name on\r\nevery card-title: _e. g._ James (Henry, 1811-82) Moralism and\r\nChristianity, New York, 1850. James (Henry, 1843- ) Daisy Miller, N. Y.\r\n1879.\r\n\r\nThe designation of book sizes is a vexed question in catalogues. The\r\ngenerally used descriptions of size, from folio down to 48mo. signify no\r\naccurate measurement whatever, the same book being described by different\r\ncatalogues as 12mo. 8vo, crown 8vo. &c., according to fancy; while the\r\nsame cataloguer who describes a volume as octavo to-day, is very likely\r\nto call it a duodecimo to-morrow. Library catalogues are full of these\r\nheterogeneous descriptions, and the size-notation is the _bête noir_ of\r\nthe veteran bibliographer, and the despair of the infant librarian. Yet\r\nit is probable that the question has excited a discussion out of all\r\nproportion to its importance. Of what consequence is the size of a book\r\nto any one, except to the searcher who has to find it on the shelves?\r\nWhile the matter has been much exaggerated, some concert or uniformity in\r\ndescribing the sizes of books is highly desirable.\r\n\r\nA Committee of the American Library Association agreed to a\r\nsize-notation, figured below, adopting the metric system as the standard,\r\nto which we add the approximate equivalents in inches.\r\n\r\n                                           _Centimetres_\r\n                            _Size_           _outside_\r\n_Sizes._               _abbreviations._      _height._    _Inches._\r\n\r\nFolio, F°.                     F                 40          16\r\nQuarto, 4°.                    Q                 30          12\r\nOctavo, 8°.                    O                 25          10\r\nDuodecimo, 12°.                D                 20           8\r\nSixteen mo., 16°.              S                 17.5         7\r\nTwenty-four mo., 24°.          T                 15           6\r\nThirty-two mo., 32°.          Tt                 12.3         5\r\nForty-eight mo., 48°.         Fe                 10           4\r\n\r\nIt will be understood that the figure against each size indicated\r\nrepresents the maximum measure: _e. g._ a volume is octavo when above 20\r\nand below 25 centimetres (8 to 10 inches high).\r\n\r\nAs this question of sizes concerns publishers and booksellers, as well as\r\nlibrarians, and the metric system, though established in continental\r\nEurope, is in little use in the United States and England, it remains\r\ndoubtful if any general adherence to this system of notation can be\r\nreached--or, indeed, to any other. The Publishers' Weekly (N. Y.) the\r\norgan of the book trade, has adopted it for the titles of new books\r\nactually in hand, but follows the publishers' descriptions of sizes as to\r\nothers. Librarian J. Winter Jones, of the British Museum, recommended\r\nclassing all books above twelve inches in height as folios, those\r\nbetween ten and twelve inches as quartos, those from seven to ten inches\r\nas octavos, and all measuring seven inches or under as 12mos. Mr. H. B.\r\nWheatley, in his work, \"How to Catalogue a Library,\" 1889, proposed to\r\ncall all books small octavos which measure below the ordinary octavo\r\nsize. As all sizes \"run into each other,\" and the former classification\r\nby the fold of the sheets is quite obsolete, people appear to be left to\r\ntheir own devices in describing the sizes of books. While the metric\r\nnotation would be exact, if the size of every book were expressed in\r\ncentimetres, the size-notation in the table given is wholly wanting in\r\nprecision, and has no more claim to be adopted than any other arbitrary\r\nplan. Still, it will serve ordinary wants, and the fact that we cannot\r\nreach an exact standard is no reason for refusing to be as nearly exact\r\nas we can.\r\n\r\nAnd while we are upon the subject of notation may be added a brief\r\nexplanation of the method adopted in earlier ages, (and especially the\r\nyears reckoned from the Christian era) to express numbers by Roman\r\nnumerals. The one simple principle was, that each letter placed after a\r\nfigure of greater equal value adds to it just the value which itself has;\r\nand, on the other hand, a letter of less value placed before (or on the\r\nleft of) a larger figure, diminishes the value of that figure in the same\r\nproportion. For example:\r\n\r\nThese letters--VI represent six; which is the same as saying V+I. On the\r\ncontrary, these same letters reversed represent four; thus--IV: that is\r\nV-I=4. Nine is represented by IX, _i. e._, X-I, ten minus one. On the\r\nsame principle, LX represents 60--or L+N: whereas XL means 40--being L-X.\r\nProceeding on the same basis, we find that LXX=L+XX=70; and LXXX or L+XXX\r\nis 80. But when we come to ninety, instead of adding four X's to the L,\r\nthey took a shorter method, and expressed it in two figures instead of\r\nfive, thus, XC, _i. e._ 100 or C-X=90.\r\n\r\nThe remarkable thing about this Roman notation is that only six letters\r\nsufficed to express all numbers up to one thousand, and even beyond, by\r\nskilful and simple combinations: namely the I, the V, the X, the L, the\r\nC, and the M, and by adding or subtracting some of these letters, when\r\nplaced before or after another letter, they had a whole succession of\r\nnumbers done to their hand--thus:\r\n\r\n   I,                1      XX,               20      CC,              200\r\n  II,                2     XXX,               30     CCC,              300\r\n III,                3      XL,               40    CCCC,              400\r\n  IV,                4       L,               50       D,              500\r\n   V,                5      LX,               60      DC,              600\r\n  VI,                6     LXX,               70     DCC,              700\r\n VII,                7    LXXX,               80    DCCC,              800\r\nVIII,                8      XC,               90      CM,              900\r\n  IX,                9       C (centum),     100       M, (mille),   1,000\r\n   X,               10\r\n\r\nNow, when the early printers came to apply dates of publication to the\r\nbooks they issued, (and here is where their methods of notation become\r\nmost important to librarians) they used precisely these methods. For\r\nexample, to express the year 1695, they printed it thus: MDCVC, that\r\nis--1000+500+100+100-5. But the printers of the 15th century and later,\r\noften used complications of letters, dictated by caprice rather than by\r\nany fixed principles, so that it is sometimes difficult to interpret\r\ncertain dates in the colophons or title-pages of books, without\r\ncollateral aid of some kind, usually supplied to the librarian by\r\nbibliographies. One of the simpler methods of departure from the regular\r\nnotation as above explained, was to substitute for the letter D (500) two\r\nletters, thus--I[inverted C], an I and a C inverted, supposed to resemble\r\nthe letter D in outline. Another fancy was to replace the M, standing for\r\n1,000, by the symbols CI[inverted C]--which present a faint approach to\r\nthe outline of the letter M, for which they stand. Thus, to express the\r\nyear 1610, we have this combination--CI[inverted C] I[inverted C] CX,\r\nwhich would be indecipherable to a modern reader, uninstructed in the\r\nnumerical signs anciently used, and their values. In like manner, 1548 is\r\nexpressed thus: MDXLIIX, meaning 1000+500+40+10-2. And for 1626, we have\r\nCI[inverted C] I[inverted C] C XXVI.\r\n\r\nAs every considerable library has early printed books, a librarian must\r\nknow these peculiarities of notation, in order to catalogue them\r\nproperly, without mistake as to their dates. In some books, where a\r\ncapricious combination of Roman numerals leaves him without a precedent\r\nto guide him to the true date, reference must be had to the\r\nbibliographies of the older literature, (as Hain, Panzer, etc.), which\r\nwill commonly solve the doubt.\r\n\r\nAs to the mechanics of catalogue-making, widely different usages and\r\nmaterials prevail. In America, the card or title-slip system is well nigh\r\nuniversal, while in England it is but slowly gaining ground, as against\r\nthe ledger or blank book catalogue. Its obvious advantage lies in\r\naffording the only possible means of maintaining a strict alphabetical\r\nsequence in titles, whether of authors or subjects. The title-cards\r\nshould be always of uniform size, and the measure most in vogue is five\r\ninches in length by three inches in breadth. They should not be too\r\nstiff, though of sufficient thickness, whether of paper or of thin card\r\nboard, to stand upright without doubling at the edges. They may be ruled\r\nor plain, at pleasure, and kept in drawers, trays, or (in case of a small\r\ncatalogue) in such paste-board boxes as letter envelopes come in.\r\n\r\nThe many advantages of the card system, both for catalogues and indexes,\r\nshould not lead us to overlook its palpable defects. These are (1) It\r\nobliges readers to manipulate many cards, to arrive at all the works of\r\nan author, or all the books on any subject, instead of having them under\r\nhis eye at once, as in printed catalogues. (2) It can be used only in the\r\nlibrary, and in only one place in the library, and by only one person at\r\na time in the same spot, while a printed catalogue can be freely used\r\nanywhere, and by any numbers, copies being multiplied. (3) It entails\r\nfrequent crowding of readers around the catalogue drawers, who need to\r\nconsult the same subjects or authors at the same time. (4) It requires\r\nimmeasurably more room than a printed catalogue, and in fact, exacts\r\nspace which in some libraries can be ill afforded. (5) It obliges readers\r\nto search the title-cards at inconvenient angles of vision, and often\r\nwith inadequate light. (6) It is cumbersome in itself, and doubly\r\ncumbersome to searchers, who must stand up instead of sitting to consult\r\nit, and travel from drawer to drawer, interfering with other searchers\r\nalmost constantly, or losing time in waiting. (7) To this is added the\r\ninconvenience of constant insertion of new title-cards by members of the\r\nlibrary staff, and the time-consuming process of working the rods which\r\nkeep the cards in place, if they are used, and if not used, the risk of\r\nloss of titles, or misplacement equivalent to loss for a time.\r\n\r\nSays Mr. H. B. Wheatley: \"I can scarcely imagine anything more maddening\r\nthan a frequent reference to cards in a drawer.\" But it is to be\r\nconsidered that all systems have defects, and the problem of choosing the\r\nleast defective is ever before us. Most of the suggested defects of the\r\ncard catalogue, as concerns the readers, can be obviated by making a\r\ntwo-fold catalogue, the type-written titles being manifolded, and one set\r\narranged in card-drawers for the use of the library staff, while another\r\nis mounted on large sheets in bound volumes for use of the public. This\r\nwould secure the advantages of a printed catalogue, with no more expense\r\nthan the manuscript titles would cost. If desired, a number of copies\r\ncould be bound up for reading-room use. Accessions of new books could be\r\nincorporated from month to month, by leaving the right-hand pages blank\r\nfor that purpose. This would be near enough to alphabetical order for\r\nmost readers, with the immense advantage of opening at one glance before\r\nthe eye, any author or subject. It would go far to solve the problem how\r\nto unite the flexibility and perfect alphabeting of the card system, with\r\nthe superior comfort, safety, and ease of reference of the book. It would\r\nalso be a safe-guard against the loss or displacement of titles, a danger\r\ninherent in the card system, as they could be replaced by copying missing\r\ntitles from the catalogue volumes.\r\n\r\nWhile the undoubted merits of the card system have been much overrated,\r\nit would be as unwise to dispense with it as the complete official\r\ncatalogue of the library, as it would be to tie down the public to its\r\nuse, when there is a more excellent way, saving time and patience, and\r\ncontributing to the comfort of all.\r\n\r\nTo print or not to print? is a vital question for libraries, and it is in\r\nmost cases decided to forego or to postpone printing, because of its\r\ngreat expense. Yet so manifest are the advantages of a printed catalogue,\r\nthat all public libraries should make every effort to endow their readers\r\nwith its benefits. These advantages are (1) Greater facility of reading\r\ntitles. (2) Much more rapid turning from letter to letter of the\r\ncatalogue alphabet. (3) Ability to consult it outside of the library. (4)\r\nUnlimited command of the catalogue by many readers at once, from the\r\nnumber of copies at hand, whereas card catalogues or manuscript volumes\r\ninvolve loss of time in waiting, or interfering with the researches of\r\nothers. A part of these advantages may be realized by printing\r\ntype-written copies of all titles in duplicate, or by carbon paper in\r\nmanifold, thus furnishing the library with several copies of its\r\ncatalogue: but why not extend this by multiplying copies through the\r\ningenious processes now in use, by which the printing of titles can be\r\neffected far more cheaply than in any printing office? Might not every\r\nlibrary become its own printer, thus saving it from the inconvenience and\r\nrisk of sending its titles outside, or the great expense of copying them\r\nfor the printer?\r\n\r\nThe titles thus manifolded could be combined into volumes, by cutting\r\naway all superfluous margins and mounting the thin title-slips\r\nalphabetically on paper of uniform size, which, when bound, would be\r\nreadily handled. All the titles of an author's works would be under the\r\neye at a glance, instead of only one at a time, as in the card catalogue.\r\nAnd the titles of books on every subject would lie open, without slowly\r\nmanipulating an infinite series of cards, one after another, to reveal\r\nthem to the eye. The classification marks could be readily placed against\r\neach title, or even printed as a part of the manifold card titles.\r\n\r\nNot that the card catalogue system would be abolished: it would remain as\r\nthe only complete catalogue of the library, always up to date, in a\r\nsingle alphabet. Daily accessions inserted in it would render it the\r\nstandard of appeal as to all that the library contained, and it would\r\nthus supplement the printed catalogue.\r\n\r\nOf course, large and increasing accessions would require to be combined\r\nin occasional supplementary volumes of the catalogue; and in no long\r\nnumber of years the whole might be re-combined in a single alphabet,\r\nfurnishing a printed dictionary catalogue up to its date.\r\n\r\nThe experience of the great British Museum Library in this matter of\r\ncatalogues is an instructive one. After printing various incomplete\r\nauthor-catalogues in the years from 1787 to 1841, the attempt to print\r\ncame to a full stop. The extensive collection grew apace, and the\r\nmanagement got along somehow with a manuscript catalogue, the titles of\r\nwhich (written in script with approximate fullness) were pasted in a\r\nseries of unwieldy but alphabetically arranged volumes. To incorporate\r\nthe accessions, these volumes had continually to be taken apart by the\r\nbinder, and the new titles combined in alphabetical order, entailing a\r\nliterally endless labor of transcribing, shifting, relaying and\r\nrebinding, to secure even an imperfect alphabetical sequence. In 1875,\r\nthe catalogue had grown to over two thousand thick folio volumes, and it\r\nwas foreseen, by a simple computation of the rate of growth of the\r\nlibrary, that in a very few years its catalogue could no longer be\r\ncontained in the reading-room. The bulky manuscript catalogue system\r\nbroke down by its own weight, and the management was compelled to resort\r\nto printing in self defence. Before the printing had reached any where\r\nnear the concluding letters of the alphabet, the MS. catalogue had grown\r\nto three thousand volumes, and was a daily and hourly incubus to\r\nlibrarians and readers.\r\n\r\nThis printed catalogue of the largest library in the world, save one, is\r\nstrictly a catalogue of authors, giving in alphabetical order the names,\r\nfollowed by the titles of all works by each writer which that library\r\npossesses. In addition, it refers in the case of biographies or comments\r\nupon any writer found in the index, to the authors of such works; and\r\nalso from translators or editors to the authors of the translated or\r\nedited work. The titles of accessions to the library (between thirty and\r\nforty thousand volumes a year) were incorporated year by year as the\r\nprinting went on. All claim to minute accuracy had to be ignored, and the\r\ntitles greatly abridged by omitting superfluous words, otherwise its cost\r\nwould have been prohibitory. The work was prosecuted with great energy\r\nand diligence by the staff of able scholars in the service of the Museum\r\nLibrary. As the catalogue embraces far more titles of books, pamphlets,\r\nand periodicals than any other ever printed, it is a great public boon,\r\nthe aid it affords to all investigators being incalculable. And any\r\nlibrary possessing it may find, with many titles of rare and unattainable\r\nworks, multitudes of books now available by purchase in the market, to\r\nenrich its own collection. It is said to contain about 3,500,000 titles\r\nand cross-references. It is printed in large, clear type, double columns,\r\nwell spaced, and its open page is a comfort to the eye. Issued in paper\r\ncovers, the thin folios can be bound in volumes of any thickness desired\r\nby the possessor.\r\n\r\nIt has several capital defects: (1) It fails to discriminate authors of\r\nthe same name by printing the years or period of each; instead of which\r\nit gives designations like \"the elder\", \"the younger\", or the residence,\r\nor occupation, or title of the author. The years during which any writer\r\nflourished would have been easily added to the name in most cases, and\r\nthe value of such information would have been great, solving at once many\r\ndoubts as to many writers. (2) The catalogue fails to print the\r\ncollations of all works, except as to a portion of those published since\r\n1882, or in the newer portions issued. This omission leaves a reader\r\nuncertain whether the book recorded is a pamphlet or an extensive work.\r\n(3) The letters I and J and U and V are run together in the alphabet,\r\nafter the ancient fashion, thus placing Josephus before Irving, and Utah\r\nafter Virginia; an arrangement highly perplexing, not to say\r\nexasperating, to every searcher. To follow an obsolete usage may be\r\ndefended on the plea that it is a good one, but when it is bad as well as\r\noutworn, no excuse for it can satisfy a modern reader. (4) No analysis is\r\ngiven of the collected works of authors, nor of many libraries made up of\r\nmonographs. One cannot find in it the contents of the volumes of any of\r\nSwift's Works, nor even of Milton's Prose Writings. (5) It fails to\r\nrecord the names of publishers, except in the case of some early or rare\r\nbooks.\r\n\r\nThe printing of this monumental catalogue began in 1881, the volumes of\r\nMS. catalogue being set up by the printer without transcription, which\r\nwould have delayed the work indefinitely, and it is now substantially\r\ncompleted. Its total cost will be not far from £50,000. There are about\r\n374 volumes or parts in all. Only 250 copies were printed, part of which\r\nwere presented to large libraries, and others were offered for sale at\r\n£3.10 per annum, payable as issued, so that a complete set costs about\r\n£70. One learns with surprise that only about forty copies have been\r\nsubscribed for. This furnishes another evidence of the low estate of\r\nbibliography in England, where, in a nation full of rich book-collectors\r\nand owners of fine libraries, almost no buyers are found for the most\r\nextensive bibliography ever published, a national work, furnishing so\r\ncopious and useful a key to the literature of the world in every\r\ndepartment of human knowledge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 23.\r\n\r\nCOPYRIGHT AND LIBRARIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe preservation of literature through public libraries has been and will\r\never be one of the most signal benefits which civilization has brought to\r\nmankind. When we consider the multitude of books which have perished from\r\nthe earth, from the want of a preserving hand, a lively sense of regret\r\ncomes over us that so few libraries have been charged with the duty of\r\nacquiring and keeping every publication that comes from the press. Yet we\r\nowe an immeasurable debt to the wisdom and far-sightedness of those who,\r\ncenturies ago, provided by this means for the perpetuity of literature.\r\n\r\nThe earliest step taken in this direction appears to have been in France.\r\nBy an ordinance proclaimed in 1537, regulating the printing of books, it\r\nwas required that a copy of each work issued from the press should be\r\ndeposited in the royal library. And it was distinctly affirmed that the\r\nground of this exaction was to preserve to posterity the literature of\r\nthe time, which might otherwise disappear.[2] This edict of three\r\ncenturies and a half ago was the seed-grain from which has grown the\r\nlargest library yet gathered in the world--the _Bibliothèque Nationale_\r\nof France. It antedated by more than two hundred years, any similar\r\nprovision in England for the preservation of the national literature.\r\n\r\nIt is a notable fact that the United States of America was the first\r\nnation that ever embodied the principle of protection to the rights of\r\nauthors in its fundamental law. \"The Congress shall have power to promote\r\nthe progress of science and useful arts, by securing for limited times to\r\nauthors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings\r\nand discoveries.\" Thus anchored in the Constitution itself, this\r\nprinciple has been further recognized by repeated acts of Congress, aimed\r\nin all cases at giving it full practical effect.\r\n\r\nIf it is asked why the authors of the Constitution gave to Congress no\r\nplenary power, which might have authorized a grant of copyright in\r\nperpetuity, the answer is, that in this, British precedent had a great,\r\nif not a controlling influence. Copyright in England, by virtue of the\r\nstatute of Anne, passed in 1710 (the first British copyright act), was\r\nlimited to fourteen years, with right of renewal, by a living author, of\r\nonly fourteen years more; and this was in full force in 1787, when our\r\nConstitution was framed. Prior to the British statute of 1710, authors\r\nhad only what is called a common law right to their writings; and however\r\ngood such a right might be, so long as they held them in manuscript, the\r\nprotection to printed books was extremely uncertain and precarious.\r\n\r\nIt has been held, indeed, that all copyright laws, so far from\r\nmaintaining an exclusive property right to authors, do in effect deny it\r\n(at least in the sense of a natural right), by explicitly limiting the\r\nterm of exclusive ownership, which might otherwise be held (as in other\r\nproperty) to be perpetual. But there is a radical distinction between the\r\nproducts of the brain, when put in the concrete form of books and\r\nmultiplied by the art of printing, and the land or other property which\r\nis held by common law tenure. Society views the absolute or exclusive\r\nproperty in books or inventions as a monopoly. While a monopoly may be\r\njustified for a reasonable number of years, on the obvious ground of\r\nsecuring to their originators the pecuniary benefit of their own ideas, a\r\nperpetual monopoly is generally regarded as odious and unjust. Hence\r\nsociety says to the author or inventor: \"Put your ideas into material\r\nform, and we will guarantee you the exclusive right to multiply and sell\r\nyour books or your inventions for a term long enough to secure a fair\r\nreward to you and to your family; after that period we want your\r\nmonopoly, with its individual benefits, to cease in favor of the greatest\r\ngood of all.\" If this appears unfair to authors, who contribute so\r\ngreatly to the instruction and the advancement of mankind, it is to be\r\nconsidered that a perpetual copyright would (1) largely increase the cost\r\nof books, which should be most widely diffused for the public benefit,\r\nprolonging the enhanced cost indefinitely beyond the author's lifetime;\r\n(2) it would benefit by a special privilege, prolonged without limit, a\r\nclass of book manufacturers or publishers who act as middle-men between\r\nthe author and the public, and who own, in most cases, the entire\r\nproperty in the works of authors deceased, and which they did not\r\noriginate; (3) it would amount in a few centuries to so vast a sum, taxed\r\nupon the community who buy books, that the publishers of Shakespeare's\r\nworks, for example, who under perpetual copyright could alone print the\r\npoet's writings, might have reaped colossal fortunes, perhaps unequalled\r\nby any private wealth yet amassed in the world.\r\n\r\nIf it is said that copyright, thus limited, is a purely arbitrary right,\r\nit may be answered that all legal provisions are arbitrary. That which is\r\nan absolute or natural right, so long as held in idea or in manuscript,\r\nbecomes, when given to the world in multiplied copies, the creature of\r\nlaw. The most that authors can fairly claim is a sufficiently prolonged\r\nexclusive right to guarantee them for a lifetime the just reward of their\r\nlabors, with a reversion for their immediate heirs. That such exclusive\r\nrights should run to their remotest posterity, or, _a fortiori_, to mere\r\nmerchants or artificers who had no hand whatever in the creation of the\r\nintellectual work thus protected, would be manifestly unjust. The\r\njudicial tribunals, both in England and America, have held that copyright\r\nlaws do not affirm an existing right, but create a right, with special\r\nprivileges not before existing, and also with special limitations.\r\n\r\nThe earliest copyright enactment of 1790 granted the exclusive privilege\r\nof printing his work to the author or his assigns for 14 + 14, or\r\ntwenty-eight years in all.\r\n\r\nThe act further required entry of the title, before publication, in the\r\noffice of the Clerk of the United States District Court in the State\r\nwhere the author or proprietor resided.\r\n\r\nThis remained the law, with slight amendment, until 1831, when a new\r\ncopyright act extended the duration of copyright from fourteen to\r\ntwenty-eight years for the original, or first term, with right of renewal\r\nto the author (now first extended to his widow or children, in case of\r\nhis decease) for fourteen additional years, making forty-two years in\r\nall.\r\n\r\nBy the same act the privilege of copyright was extended to cover musical\r\ncompositions, as it had been earlier extended (in 1802) to include\r\ndesigns, engravings, and etchings. Copyright was further extended in 1856\r\nto dramatic compositions, and in 1865 to photographs and negatives\r\nthereof. In 1870 a new copyright code, to take the place of all existing\r\nand scattered statutes, was enacted, and there were added to the lawful\r\nsubjects of copyright, paintings, drawings, chromos, statues, statuary,\r\nand models or designs intended to be perfected as works of the fine\r\narts. And finally, by act of March 3, 1891, the benefits of copyright\r\nwere extended so as to embrace foreign authors. In 1897, Congress created\r\nthe office of Register of Copyrights, but continued the Copyright office,\r\nwith its records, in the Library of Congress.\r\n\r\nIn 1846, the first enactment entitling the Library of the United States\r\nGovernment to a copy of every work protected by copyright was passed.\r\nThis act, to establish the Smithsonian Institution, required that one\r\ncopy of each copyright publication be deposited therein, and one copy in\r\nthe Library of Congress. No penalties were provided, and in 1859, on\r\ncomplaint of the authorities of the Smithsonian Institution that the law\r\nbrought in much trash in the shape of articles which were not books, the\r\nlaw was repealed, with the apparent concurrence of those in charge of the\r\nCongressional Library.\r\n\r\nThis left that Library without any accessions of copyright books until\r\n1865, when, at the instance of the present writer, the Library Committee\r\nrecommended, and Congress passed an act restoring the privilege to the\r\nLibrary of Congress. But it was found to require, in order to its\r\nenforcement, frequent visits to the records of the clerks of United\r\nStates District Courts in many cities, with costly transcripts of records\r\nin more than thirty other offices, in order to ascertain what books had\r\nactually been copyrighted. To this was added the necessity of issuing\r\ndemands upon delinquent authors or publishers for books not sent to the\r\nLibrary; no residence of the delinquents, however, being found in any of\r\nthe records, which simply recorded those claiming copyright as \"of the\r\nsaid District.\"\r\n\r\nIt resulted that no complete, nor even approximate compliance with the\r\nlaw was secured, and after five years' trial, the Librarian was obliged\r\nto bring before the committees of Congress the plan of a copyright\r\nregistry at the seat of government, as had been the requirement in the\r\ncase of Patents from the beginning.\r\n\r\nThe law of copyright, as codified by act of July 8, 1870, made an epoch\r\nin the copyright system of the United States. It transferred the entire\r\nregistry of books and other publications, under copyright law, to the\r\ncity of Washington, and made the Librarian of Congress sole register of\r\ncopyrights, instead of the clerks of the District Courts of the United\r\nStates. Manifold reasons existed for this radical change, and those which\r\nwere most influential with Congress in making it were the following:\r\n\r\n1. The transfer of the copyright records to Washington it was foreseen\r\nwould concentrate and simplify the business, and this was a cardinal\r\npoint. Prior to 1870 there were between forty and fifty separate and\r\ndistinct authorities for issuing copyrights. The American people were put\r\nto much trouble to find out where to apply, in the complicated system of\r\nDistrict Courts, several of them frequently in a single State, to enter\r\ntitles for publication. They were required to make entry in the district\r\nwhere the applicant resided, and this was frequently a matter of doubt.\r\nMoreover, they were required to go to the expense and trouble of\r\ntransmitting a copy of the work, after publication, to the District\r\nclerk, and another copy to the Library of Congress. Were both copies\r\nmailed to Washington (post-free by law) this duty would be diminished by\r\none-half.\r\n\r\n2. A copyright work is not an invention nor a patent; it is a\r\ncontribution to literature. It is not material, but intellectual, and has\r\nno natural relation to a department which is charged with the care of the\r\nmechanic arts; and it belongs rather to a national library system than to\r\nany other department of the civil service. The responsibility of caring\r\nfor it would be an incident to the similar labors already devolved upon\r\nthe Librarian of Congress; and the receipts from copyright certificates\r\nwould much more than pay its expense, thus leaving the treasury the\r\ngainer by the change.\r\n\r\n3. The advantage of securing to our national library a complete\r\ncollection of all American copyright publications can scarcely be\r\nover-estimated. If such a law as that enacted in 1870 had been enforced\r\nsince the beginning of the government, we should now have in the Library\r\nof Congress a complete representation of the product of the American mind\r\nin every department of science and literature. Many publications which\r\nare printed in small editions, or which become \"out of print\" from the\r\nmany accidents which continually destroy books, would owe to such a\r\nlibrary their sole chance of preservation. We ought to have one\r\ncomprehensive library in the country, and that belonging to the nation,\r\nwhose aim it should be to preserve the books which other libraries have\r\nnot the room nor the means to procure.\r\n\r\n4. This consideration assumes additional weight when it is remembered\r\nthat the Library of Congress is freely open to the public day and evening\r\nthroughout the year, and is rapidly becoming the great reference library\r\nof the country, resorted to not only by Congress and the residents of\r\nWashington, but by students and writers from all parts of the Union, in\r\nsearch of references and authorities not elsewhere to be found. The\r\nadvantage of having all American publications accessible upon inquiry\r\nwould be to build up at Washington a truly national library,\r\napproximately complete and available to all the people.\r\n\r\nThese considerations prevailed with Congress to effect the amendment in\r\ncopyright registration referred to.\r\n\r\nBy enactment of the statute of 1870 all the defects in the methods of\r\nregistration and deposit of copies were obviated. The original records of\r\ncopyright in all the States were thenceforward kept in the office of the\r\nLibrarian of Congress. All questions as to literary property, involving a\r\nsearch of records to determine points of validity, such as priority of\r\nentry, names and residence of actual owners, transfers or assignments,\r\ntimely deposit of the required copies, etc., could be determined upon\r\ninquiry at a single office of record. These inquiries are extremely\r\nnumerous, and obviously very important, involving frequently large\r\ninterests in valuable publications in which litigation to establish the\r\nrights of authors, publishers or infringers has been commenced or\r\nthreatened. By the full records of copyright entries thus preserved,\r\nmoreover, the Library of Congress (which is the property of the nation)\r\nhas been enabled to secure what was before unattainable, namely, an\r\napproximately complete collection of all American books, etc., protected\r\nby copyright, since the legislation referred to went into effect. The\r\nsystem has been found in practice to give general satisfaction; the\r\nmanner of securing copyright has been made plain and easy to all, the\r\noffice of record being now a matter of public notoriety; and the test of\r\nexperience during thirty years has established the system so thoroughly\r\nthat none would be found to favor a return to the former methods.\r\n\r\nThe Act of 1870 provided for the removal of the collection of copyright\r\nbooks and other publications from the over-crowded Patent Office to the\r\nLibrary of Congress. These publications were the accumulations of about\r\neighty years, received from the United States District Clerks' offices\r\nunder the old law. By request of the Commissioner of Patents all the law\r\nbooks and a large number of technical works were reserved at the\r\nDepartment of the Interior. The residue, when removed to the Capitol,\r\nwere found to number 23,070 volumes, a much smaller number than had been\r\nanticipated, in view of the length of time during which the copy tax had\r\nbeen in operation. But the observance of the acts requiring deposits of\r\ncopyright publications with the Clerks of the United States District\r\nCourts had been very defective (no penalty being provided for\r\nnon-compliance), and, moreover, the Patent Office had failed to receive\r\nfrom the offices of original deposit large numbers of publications which\r\nshould have been sent to Washington. From one of the oldest States in the\r\nUnion not a single book had been sent in evidence of copyright. The\r\nbooks, however, which were added to the Congressional Library, although\r\nconsisting largely of school books and the minor literature of the last\r\nhalf century, comprised many valuable additions to the collection of\r\nAmerican books, which it should be the aim of a National Library to\r\nrender complete. Among them were the earliest editions of the works of\r\nmany well-known writers, now out of print and scarce.\r\n\r\nThe first book ever entered for copyright privileges under the laws of\r\nthe United States was \"The Philadelphia Spelling Book,\" which was\r\nregistered in the Clerk's Office of the District of Pennsylvania, June 9,\r\n1790, by John Barry as author. The spelling book was a fit introduction\r\nto the long series of books since produced to further the diffusion of\r\nknowledge among men. The second book entered was \"The American\r\nGeography,\" by Jedediah Morse, entered in the District of Massachusetts\r\non July 10, 1790, a copy of which is preserved in the Library of\r\nCongress. The earliest book entered in the State of New York was on the\r\n30th of April, 1791, and it was entitled \"The Young Gentleman's and\r\nLady's Assistant, by Donald Fraser, Schoolmaster.\"\r\n\r\nObjection has occasionally, though rarely, been made to what is known as\r\nthe copy-tax, by which two copies of each publication must be deposited\r\nin the National Library. This requirement rests upon two valid grounds:\r\n(1) The preservation of copies of everything protected by copyright is\r\nnecessary in the interest of authors and publishers, in evidence of\r\ncopyright, and in aid of identification in connection with the record of\r\ntitle; (2) the library of the government (which is that of the whole\r\npeople) should possess and permanently preserve a complete collection of\r\nthe products of the American press, so far as secured by copyright. The\r\ngovernment makes no unreasonable exaction in saying to authors and\r\npublishers: \"The nation gives you exclusive right to make and sell your\r\npublication, without limit as to quantity, for forty-two years; give the\r\nnation in return two copies, one for the use and reference of Congress\r\nand the public in the National Library, the other for preservation in the\r\ncopyright archives, in perpetual evidence of your right.\"\r\n\r\nIn view of the valuable monopoly conceded by the public, does not the\r\ngovernment in effect give far more than a _quid pro quo_ for the\r\ncopy-tax? Of course it would not be equitable to exact even one copy of\r\npublications not secured by copyright, in which case the government gives\r\nnothing and gets nothing; but the exaction of actually protected\r\npublications, while it is almost unfelt by publishers, is so clearly in\r\nthe interest of the public intelligence, as well as of authors and\r\npublishers themselves, that no valid objection to it appears to exist. In\r\nGreat Britain five copies of every book protected by copyright are\r\nrequired for five different libraries, which appears somewhat\r\nunreasonable.\r\n\r\nRegarding the right of renewal of the term of copyright, it is a\r\nsignificant fact that it is availed of in comparatively few instances,\r\ncompared with the whole body of publications. Multitudes of books are\r\npublished which not only never reach a second edition, but the sale of\r\nwhich does not exhaust more than a small part of the copies printed of\r\nthe first. In these cases the right of renewal is waived and suffered to\r\nlapse, from defect of commercial value in the work protected. In many\r\nother cases the right of renewal expires before the author or his assigns\r\nbethink them of the privilege secured to them under the law. It results\r\nthat more than nine-tenths, probably, of all books published are free to\r\nany one to print, without reward or royalty to their authors, after a\r\nvery few years have elapsed. On the other hand, the exclusive right in\r\nsome publications of considerable commercial value is kept alive far\r\nbeyond the forty-two years included in the original and the renewal term,\r\nby entry of new editions of the work, and securing copyright on the same.\r\nWhile this method may not protect any of the original work from\r\nrepublication by others, it enables the publishers of the copyright\r\nedition to advertise such unauthorized reprints as imperfect, and without\r\nthe author's or editor's latest revision or additions.\r\n\r\nThe whole number of entries of copyright in the United States since we\r\nbecame a nation considerably exceeds a million and a half. It may be of\r\ninterest to give the aggregate number of titles of publications entered\r\nfor copyright in each year since the transfer of the entire records to\r\nWashington in 1870.\r\n\r\n      COPYRIGHTS REGISTERED IN THE UNITED STATES,\r\n                   1870-1899.\r\n\r\n1870    5,600     1874   16,283     1878   15,798\r\n1871   12,688     1875   14,364     1879   18,125\r\n1872   14,164     1876   14,882     1880   20,686\r\n1873   15,352     1877   15,758     1881   21,075\r\n1882   22,918     1888   38,225     1894   62,762\r\n1883   25,273     1889   40,777     1895   67,572\r\n1884   26,893     1890   42,758     1896   72,470\r\n1885   28,410     1891   48,908     1897   74,321\r\n1886   31,241     1892   54,735     1898   76,874\r\n1887   35,083     1893   58,936     1899   86,492\r\n\r\n     Total, 30 years,                   1,079,445\r\n\r\nIt will readily be seen that this great number of copyrights does not\r\nrepresent books alone. Many thousands of entries are daily and weekly\r\nperiodicals claiming copyright protection, in which case they are\r\nrequired by law to make entry of every separate issue. These include a\r\nmultitude of journals, literary, political, scientific, religious,\r\npictorial, technical, commercial, agricultural, sporting, dramatic, etc.,\r\namong which are a number in foreign languages. These entries also embrace\r\nall the leading monthly and quarterly magazines and reviews, with many\r\ndevoted to specialties--as metaphysics, sociology, law, theology, art,\r\nfinance, education, and the arts and sciences generally. Another large\r\nclass of copyright entries (and the largest next to books and\r\nperiodicals) is musical compositions, numbering recently some 20,000\r\npublications yearly. Much of this property is valuable, and it is nearly\r\nall protected by entry of copyright, coming from all parts of the Union.\r\nThere is also a large and constantly increasing number of works of\r\ngraphic art, comprising engravings, photographs, photogravures, chromos,\r\nlithographs, etchings, prints, and drawings, for which copyright is\r\nentered. The steady accumulation of hundreds of thousands of these\r\nvarious pictorial illustrations will enable the government at no distant\r\nday, without a dollar of expense, to make an exhibit of the progress of\r\nthe arts of design in America, which will be highly interesting and\r\ninstructive. An art gallery of ample dimensions for this purpose is\r\nprovided in the new National Library building.\r\n\r\nIt remains to consider briefly the principles and practice of what is\r\nknown as international copyright.\r\n\r\nPerhaps there is no argument for copyright at all in the productions of\r\nthe intellect which is not good for its extension to all countries. The\r\nbasis of copyright is that all useful labor is worthy of a recompense;\r\nbut since all human thought when put into material or merchantable form\r\nbecomes, in a certain sense, public property, the laws of all countries\r\nrecognize and protect the original owners, or their assigns to whom they\r\nmay convey the right, in an exclusive privilege for limited terms only.\r\nLiterary property therefore is not a natural right, but a conventional\r\none. The author's right to his manuscript is, indeed, absolute, and the\r\nlaw will protect him in it as fully as it will guard any other property.\r\nBut when once put in type and multiplied through the printing-press, his\r\nclaim to an exclusive right has to be guarded by a special statute,\r\notherwise it is held to be abandoned (like the articles in a newspaper)\r\nto the public. This special protection is furnished in nearly all\r\ncivilized countries by copyright law.\r\n\r\nWhat we call \"copyright\" is an exclusive right to multiply copies of any\r\npublication for sale. Domestic copyright, which is all we formerly had in\r\nthis country, is limited to the United States. International copyright,\r\nwhich has now been enacted, extends the right of American authors to\r\nforeign countries, and recognizes a parallel right of foreign authors in\r\nour own. There is nothing in the constitutional provision which restrains\r\nCongress from granting copyright to other than American citizens. Patent\r\nright, coming under the same clause of the Constitution, has been\r\nextended to foreigners. Out of over 20,000 patents annually issued, about\r\n2,500 (or 12 per cent.) are issued to foreigners, while American patents\r\nare similarly protected abroad. If we have international patent right,\r\nwhy not international copyright? The grant of power is the same; both\r\npatent right and copyright are for a limited time; both rights during\r\nthis time are exclusive; and both rest upon the broad ground of the\r\npromotion of science and the useful arts. If copyright is justifiable at\r\nall, if authors are to be secured a reward for their labors, they claim\r\nthat all who use them should contribute equally to this result. The\r\nprinciple of copyright once admitted, it cannot logically be confined to\r\nState lines or national boundaries. There appears to be no middle ground\r\nbetween the doctrine of common property in all productions of the\r\nintellect--which leads us to communism by the shortest road--and the\r\nadmission that copyright is due, while its limited term lasts, from all\r\nwho use the works of an author, wherever found.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, international copyright has become the policy of nearly all\r\ncivilized nations. The term of copyright is longer in most countries than\r\nin the United States, ranging from the life of the author and seven years\r\nbeyond, in England, to a life term and fifty years additional in France\r\nand Russia. Copyright is thus made a life tenure and something more in\r\nall countries except our own, where its utmost limit is forty-two years.\r\nThis may perhaps be held to represent a fair average lifetime, reckoned\r\nfrom the age of intellectual maturity. There have not been wanting\r\nadvocates for a perpetual copyright, to run to the author and his heirs\r\nand assigns forever. This was urged before the British Copyright\r\nCommission in 1878 by leading British publishers, but the term of\r\ncopyright is hitherto, in all nations, limited by law.\r\n\r\nOnly brief allusion can be made to the most recent (and in some respects\r\nmost important) advance step which has been taken in copyright\r\nlegislation in the United States. This act of Congress is aimed at\r\nsecuring reciprocal protection to American and foreign authors in the\r\nrespective countries which may comply with its provisions. There is here\r\nno room to sketch the hitherto vain attempt to secure to authors, here\r\nand abroad, an international protection to their writings. Suffice it to\r\nsay that a union of interests was at last effected, whereby authors,\r\npublishers and manufacturers are supposed to have secured some measure of\r\nprotection to their varied interests. The measure is largely\r\nexperimental, and the satisfaction felt over its passage into law is\r\ntempered by doubt in various quarters as to the justice, or liberality,\r\nor actual benefit to authors of its provisions. What is to be said of a\r\nstatute which was denounced by some Senators as a long step backward\r\ntoward barbarism, and hailed by others as a great landmark in the\r\nprogress of civilization?\r\n\r\nThe main features added to the existing law of copyright by this act,\r\nwhich took effect July 1, 1891, are these:\r\n\r\n1. All limitation of the privilege of copyright to citizens and residents\r\nof the United States is repealed.\r\n\r\n2. Foreigners applying for copyright are to pay fees of $1 for record, or\r\n$1.50 for certificate of copyright.\r\n\r\n3. Importation of books, photographs, chromos or lithographs entered here\r\nfor copyright is prohibited, except two copies of any book for use and\r\nnot for sale.\r\n\r\n4. The two copies of books, photographs, chromos or lithographs deposited\r\nwith the Librarian of Congress must be printed from type set, or plates,\r\netc., made in the United States. It follows that all foreign works\r\nprotected by American copyright must be wholly manufactured in this\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n5. The copyright privilege is restricted to citizens or subjects of\r\nnations permitting the benefit of copyright to Americans on\r\nsubstantially the same terms as their own citizens, or of nations who\r\nhave international agreements providing for reciprocity in the grant of\r\ncopyright, to which the United States may at its pleasure become a party.\r\n\r\n6. The benefit of copyright in the United States is not to take effect as\r\nto any foreigner until the actual existence of either of the conditions\r\njust recited, in the case of the nation to which he belongs, shall have\r\nbeen made known by a proclamation of the President of the United States.\r\n\r\nOne very material benefit has been secured through international\r\ncopyright. Under it, authors are assured the control of their own text,\r\nboth as to correctness and completeness. Formerly, republication was\r\nconducted on a \"scramble\" system, by which books were hastened through\r\nthe press, to secure the earliest market, with little or no regard to a\r\ncorrect re-production. Moreover, it was in the power of the American\r\npublisher of an English book, or of a British publisher of an American\r\none, to alter or omit passages in any work reprinted, at his pleasure.\r\nThis license was formerly exercised, and imperfect, garbled, or truncated\r\neditions of an author's writings were issued without his consent, an\r\noutrage against which international copyright furnishes the only\r\npreventive.\r\n\r\nAnother benefit of copyright between nations has been to check the\r\nrelentless flood of cheap, unpaid-for fiction, which formerly poured from\r\nthe press, submerging the better literature. The Seaside and other\r\nlibraries, with their miserable type, flimsy paper, and ugly form, were\r\nan injury alike to the eyesight, to the taste, and in many cases, to the\r\nmorals of the community. More than ninety per cent. of these wretched\r\n\"Libraries\" were foreign novels. An avalanche of English and translated\r\nFrench novels of the \"bigamy school\" of fiction swept over the land,\r\nuntil the cut-throat competition of publishers, after exhausting the\r\nstock of unwholesome foreign literature, led to the failure of many\r\nhouses, and piled high the counters of book and other stores with\r\nbankrupt stock. Having at last got rid of this unclean brood, (it is\r\nhoped forever) we now have better books, produced on good paper and type,\r\nand worth preserving, at prices not much above those of the trash\r\nformerly offered us.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, standard works of science and literature are being\r\npublished in England at prices which tend steadily toward increased\r\npopular circulation. Even conservative publishers are reversing the rule\r\nof small editions at high prices, for larger editions at low prices. The\r\nold three-volume novel is nearly supplanted by the one volume,\r\nwell-printed and bound book at five or six shillings. Many more\r\nreductions would follow in the higher class of books, were not the\r\nmeasure of reciprocal copyright thus far secured handicapped by the\r\nnecessity of re-printing on this side at double cost, if a large American\r\ncirculation is in view.\r\n\r\nThe writers of America, with the steady and rapid progress of the art of\r\nmaking books, have come more and more to appreciate the value of their\r\npreservation, in complete and unbroken series, in the library of the\r\ngovernment, the appropriate conservator of the nation's literature.\r\nInclusive and not exclusive, as this library is wisely made by law, so\r\nfar as copyright works are concerned, it preserves with impartial care\r\nthe illustrious and the obscure. In its archives all sciences and all\r\nschools of opinion stand on equal ground. In the beautiful and ample\r\nrepository, now erected and dedicated to literature and art through the\r\nliberal action of Congress, the intellectual wealth of the past and the\r\npresent age will be handed down to the ages that are to follow.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[2] G.

     With an open book before him;\r\n    And slowly nodded his weary head,\r\n      As slumber came stealing o'er him.\r\n\r\n                      2.\r\n    And he saw in his dream a mighty host\r\n      Of the writers gone before,\r\n    And the shadowy form of many a ghost\r\n      Glided in at the open door.\r\n\r\n                      3.\r\n    Great Homer came first in a snow-white shroud,\r\n      And Virgil sang sweet by his side;\r\n    While Cicero thundered in accents loud,\r\n      And Caesar most gravely replied.\r\n\r\n                      4.\r\n    Anacreon, too, from his rhythmical lips\r\n      The honey of Hybla distilled,\r\n    And Herodotus suffered a partial eclipse,\r\n      While Horace with music was filled.\r\n\r\n                      5.\r\n    The procession of ancients was brilliant and long,\r\n      Aristotle and Plato were there,\r\n    Thucydides, too, and Tacitus strong,\r\n      And Plutarch, and Sappho the fair.\r\n\r\n                      6.\r\n    Aristophanes elbowed gay Ovid's white ghost,\r\n      And Euripides Xenophon led,\r\n    While Propertius laughed loud at Juvenal's jokes,\r\n      And Sophocles rose from the dead.\r\n\r\n                      7.\r\n    Then followed a throng to memory dear,\r\n      Of writers more modern in age,\r\n    Cervantes and Shakespeare, who died the same year,\r\n      And Chaucer, and Bacon the sage.\r\n\r\n                      8.\r\n    Immortal the laurels that decked the fair throng,\r\n      And Dante moved by with his lyre,\r\n    While Montaigne and Pascal stood rapt by his song,\r\n      And Boccaccio paused to admire.\r\n\r\n                      9.\r\n    Sweet Spenser and Calderon moved arm in arm,\r\n      While Milton and Sidney were there,\r\n    Pope, Dryden, and Molière added their charm,\r\n      And Bunyan, and Marlowe so rare.\r\n\r\n                     10.\r\n    Then Gibbon stalked by in classical guise,\r\n      And Hume, and Macaulay, and Froude,\r\n    While Darwin, and Huxley, and Tyndall looked wise,\r\n      And Humboldt and Comte near them stood.\r\n\r\n                     11.\r\n    Dean Swift looked sardonic on Addison's face,\r\n      And Johnson tipped Boswell a wink,\r\n    Walter Scott and Jane Austen hobnobbed o'er a glass,\r\n      And Goethe himself deigned to drink.\r\n\r\n                     12.\r\n    Robert Burns followed next with Thomas Carlyle,\r\n      Jean Paul paired with Coleridge, too,\r\n    While De Foe elbowed Goldsmith, the master of style,\r\n      And Fielding and Schiller made two.\r\n\r\n                     13.\r\n    Rousseau with his eloquent, marvellous style,\r\n      And Voltaire, with his keen, witty pen,\r\n    Victor Hugo so grand, though repellent the while,\r\n      And Dumas and Balzac again.\r\n\r\n                     14.\r\n    Dear Thackeray came in his happiest mood,\r\n      And stayed until midnight was done,\r\n    Bulwer-Lytton, and Reade, and Kingsley and Hood,\r\n      And Dickens, the master of fun.\r\n\r\n                     15.\r\n    George Eliot, too, with her matter-full page,\r\n      And Byron, and Browning, and Keats,\r\n    While Shelley and Tennyson joined youth and age,\r\n      And Wordsworth the circle completes.\r\n\r\n                     16.\r\n    Then followed a group of America's best,\r\n      With Irving, and Bryant, and Holmes,\r\n    While Bancroft and Motley unite with the rest,\r\n      And Thoreau with Whittier comes.\r\n\r\n                     17.\r\n    With his Raven in hand dreamed on Edgar Poe,\r\n      And Longfellow sweet and serene,\r\n    While Prescott, and Ticknor, and Emerson too,\r\n      And Hawthorne and Lowell were seen.\r\n\r\n                     18.\r\n    While thus the assembly of witty and wise\r\n      Rejoiced the librarian's sight,\r\n    Ere the wonderful vision had fled from his eyes,\r\n      From above shone a heavenly light:\r\n\r\n                     19.\r\n    And solemn and sweet came a voice from the skies,\r\n      \"All battles and conflicts are done,\r\n    The temple of Knowledge shall open all eyes,\r\n      And law, faith, and reason are one!\"\r\n\r\n    When the radiant dawn of the morning broke,\r\n    From his glorious dream the librarian woke.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE LIBRARY.\r\n\r\n    That

always in black, and I'm always in white;\r\n    I am grave and I'm gay, I am heavy and light.\r\n    In form too I differ,--I'm thick and I'm thin;\r\n    I've no flesh and no bone, yet I'm covered with skin;\r\n    I've more points than the compass, more stops than the flute;\r\n    I sing without voice, without speaking confute;\r\n    I'm English, I'm German, I'm French, and I'm Dutch;\r\n    Some love me too fondly, some slight me too much;\r\n    I often die soon, though I sometimes live ages,\r\n    And no monarch alive has so many pages.\r\n

The makers of second-hand catalogues are\r\nresponsible for much of this, in describing the books which they wish to\r\nsell as \"rare,\" \"very scarce,\" etc., but more of it proceeds from\r\nabsolute ignorance of the book-markets of the world. I have had\r\nmultitudes of volumes offered for sale whose commercial value was hardly\r\nas many cents as was demanded in dollars by their ill-informed owners,\r\nwho fancied the commonest book valuable because they \"had never seen\r\nanother copy.\" No one's ideas of the money value of any book are worth\r\nanything, unless he has had long experimental knowledge of the market for\r\nbooks both in America and in Europe.\r\n\r\nWhat constitutes rarity in books is a question that involves many\r\nparticulars. Thus, a given book may be rare in the United States which is\r\nabundant in London; or rare in London, when common enough in Germany. So\r\nbooks may be rare in one age which were easily found in another: and\r\nagain, books on certain subjects may be so absorbed by public demand when\r\nevents excite interest in that subject, as to take up most of the copies\r\nin market, and enhance the price of the remainder. Thus, Napoleon's\r\nconquering career in Egypt created a great demand for all books on Egypt\r\nand Africa. The scheme for founding a great French colony in Louisiana\r\nraised the price of all books and pamphlets on that region, which soon\r\nafter fell into the possession of the United States. President Lincoln's\r\nassassination caused a demand for all accounts of the murder of the heads\r\nof nations. Latterly, all books on Cuba, the West Indies, and the\r\nPhilippines have been in unprecedented demand, and dealers have raised\r\nthe prices, which will again decline after the recent public interest in\r\nthem has been supplanted by future events.\r\n\r\nThere is a broad distinction to be drawn between books which are\r\nabsolutely rare, and those which are only relatively scarce, or which\r\nbecome temporarily rare, as just explained. Thus, a large share of the\r\nbooks published in the infancy of printing are _rare_; nearly all which\r\nappeared in the quarter century after printing began are _very_ rare; and\r\nseveral among these last are _superlatively_ rare. I may instance the\r\nMazarin Bible of Gutenberg and Schoeffer (1455?) of which only\r\ntwenty-four copies are known, nearly all in public libraries, where they\r\nought to be; the Mentz Psalter of the same printers, 1457, the first book\r\never printed with a date; and the first edition of Livy, Rome [1469] the\r\nonly copy of which printed on vellum is in the British Museum Library.\r\n\r\nOne reason of the scarcity of books emanating from the presses of the\r\nfifteenth century is that of many of them the editions consisted of only\r\ntwo hundred to three hundred copies, of which the large number absorbed\r\nin public libraries, or destroyed by use, fire or decay, left very few in\r\nthe hands of booksellers or private persons. Still, it is a great mistake\r\nto infer that all books printed before A. D. 1500 are rare. The editions\r\nof many were large, especially after about 1480, many were reprinted in\r\nseveral editions, and of such incunabula copies can even now be picked up\r\non the continent at very low prices.\r\n\r\nContrary to a wide-spread belief, mere age adds very little to the value\r\nof any book, and oft-times nothing at all. All librarians are pestered\r\nto buy \"hundred year old\" treatises on theology or philosophy, as dry as\r\nthe desert of Sahara, on the ground that they are both old and rare,\r\nwhereas such books, two hundred and even three hundred years old, swarm\r\nin unsalable masses on the shelves of London and provincial booksellers\r\nat a few pence per volume. The reason that they are comparatively rare in\r\nthis country is that nobody wants them, and so they do not get imported.\r\n\r\nA rare book is, strictly speaking, only one which is found with\r\ndifficulty, taking into view all the principal book markets of various\r\ncountries. Very few books printed since 1650 have any peculiar value on\r\naccount of their age. Of many books, both old and new, the reason of\r\nscarcity is that only a few copies actually remain, outside of public\r\nlibraries, and these last, of course, are not for sale. This scarcity of\r\ncopies is produced by a great variety of causes, most of which are here\r\nnoted.\r\n\r\n(1) The small number of the books originally printed leads to rarity.\r\nThis is by no means peculiar to early impressions of the press: on the\r\ncontrary, of some books printed only last year not one tenth as many\r\nexist as of a multitude of books printed four centuries ago. Not only\r\nprivately printed books, not designed for publication, but some family or\r\npersonal memoirs, or original works circulated only among friends, and\r\nmany other publications belong to this class of rarities. The books\r\nprinted at private presses are mostly rare. Horace Walpole's Strawberry\r\nHill press produced some thirty works from 1757 to 1789, in editions\r\nvarying from fifty to six hundred copies. The Lee Priory press of Sir E.\r\nBrydges printed many literary curiosities, none of which had more than\r\none hundred impressions. Most of the editions of the Shakespearean and\r\nother critical essays of J. O. Halliwell-Phillipps were limited to forty\r\ncopies, or even less. The genealogical and heraldic imprints of Sir\r\nThomas Phillipps, at the Middle Hill press, 1819-59, numbering some\r\nhundreds of different works, were mostly confined to twenty copies each,\r\nand some to only six copies. Some of them are as rare as many\r\nmanuscripts, of which several copies have been made, and sell at prices\r\ndictated by their scarcity. Most of them are in the Library of Congress.\r\nThe Kelmscott press of William Morris printed in sumptuous style,\r\nimproved upon the finest models of antique typography, a number of\r\nliterary works, which now bring enhanced prices. Of the many historical\r\nand literary publications of the Roxburghe Club, the Percy Society, the\r\nMaitland, the Abbotsford, and the Bannatyne Clubs abroad, only thirty to\r\none hundred copies were printed. Of those of the Prince Society, the\r\nGrolier Club, and others in America, only from 150 to 300 copies were\r\nprinted, being for subscribers only. Rarity and enhanced prices\r\nnecessarily result in all these cases. Of some books, only five to ten\r\ncopies have been printed, or else, out of fifty or more printed, all but\r\na very few have been ruthlessly destroyed, in order to give a fanciful\r\nvalue to the remainder. In these extreme instances, the rarity commonly\r\nconstitutes almost the sole value of the work.\r\n\r\n(2) Even where many copies have been printed, the destruction of the\r\ngreater part of the edition has rendered the book very rare. Printing\r\noffices and book binderies are peculiarly subject to fires, and many\r\neditions have thus been consumed before more than a few copies have been\r\nissued. The great theological libraries edited by the Abbé J. P. Migne,\r\nthe _Patrologie Grecque, et Latine_, owe their scarcity and advanced\r\nprices to a fire which consumed the entire remainder of the edition. All\r\nthe copies of a large edition of \"Twenty years among our savage Indians,\"\r\nby J. L. Humfreville, were destroyed by fire in a Hartford printing\r\noffice in 1899, except two, which had been deposited in the Library of\r\nCongress, to secure the copyright. The whole edition of the _Machina\r\ncoelestis_ of Hevelius was burned, except the few copies which the author\r\nhad presented to friends before the fire occurred. The earlier issues in\r\nSpanish of the Mexican and Peruvian presses prior to 1600 are exceedingly\r\nrare. And editions of books printed at places in the United States where\r\nno books are now published are sought for their imprint alone and seldom\r\nfound.\r\n\r\n(3) Many books have become rare because proscribed and in part destroyed\r\nby governmental or ecclesiastical authority. This applies more especially\r\nto the ages that succeeded the application of printing to the art of\r\nmultiplying books. The freedom of many writers upon politics and popular\r\nrights led to the suppression of their books by kings, emperors or\r\nparliaments. At the same time, books of church history or doctrinal\r\ntheology which departed, in however slight a degree, from the standard of\r\nfaith proclaimed by the church, were put in the Index Expurgatorius, or\r\nlist of works condemned in whole or in part as heretical and unlawful to\r\nbe read. A long and melancholy record of such proscriptions, civil and\r\necclesiastical, is found in Gabriel Peignot's two volumes--_Dictionnaire\r\ndes livres condamnés au feu, supprimés, ou censurés_, etc. Works of\r\nwriters of genius and versatile ability were thus proscribed, until it\r\ngave rise to the sarcasm among the scholars of Europe, that if one wanted\r\nto find what were the books best worth reading, he should look in the\r\nIndex Expurgatorius. It appears to have been quite forgotten by those in\r\nauthority that persecution commonly helps the cause persecuted, and that\r\nthe best way to promote the circulation of a book is to undertake to\r\nsuppress it. This age finds itself endowed with so many heretics that it\r\nis no longer possible to find purchasers at high prices for books once\r\ndeemed unholy. Suppressed passages in later editions lead to a demand for\r\nthe uncastrated copies which adds an element of enhanced cost in the\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\n(4) Another source of rarity is the great extent and cost of many works,\r\noutrunning the ability of most collectors to buy or to accommodate them\r\non their shelves. These costly possessions have been commonly printed in\r\nlimited numbers for subscribers, or for distribution by governments under\r\nwhose patronage they were produced. Such are some of the notable\r\ncollections of early voyages, the great folios of many illustrated\r\nscientific works on natural history, local geography, etc. That great\r\nscholar, Baron von Humboldt, used jocosely to say that he could not\r\nafford to own a set of his own works, most of which are folios\r\nsumptuously printed, with finely engraved illustrations. The collection\r\nknown as the \"_Grands et petits Voyages_\" of De Bry, the former in 13\r\nvolumes, relating to America, and finely illustrated with copper-plates\r\nproduced in the highest style of that art, are among the rarest sets of\r\nbooks to find complete. The collection of voyages by Hulsius is equally\r\ndifficult to procure. A really perfect set of Piranesi's great\r\nillustrated work on the art and architecture of ancient Rome is very\r\ndifficult to acquire. The _Acta Sanctorum_, in the original edition, is\r\nvery seldom found. But there is no room to multiply examples.\r\n\r\n(5) What adds to the rarity and cost of certain books is the peculiarly\r\nexpensive style or condition in which they are produced or preserved.\r\nSome few copies of an edition, for example, are printed on vellum, or on\r\nChina or India or other choice paper, in colored ink or bronze, on\r\ncolored paper, (rose-tinted, or green, blue or yellow,) on large paper,\r\nwith broad margins, etc. Uncut copies always fetch a higher price than\r\nthose whose edges are trimmed down in binding. To some book-collecting\r\namateurs cut edges are an abomination. They will pay more for a book \"in\r\nsheets,\" which they can bind after their own taste, than for the finest\r\ncopy in calf or morocco with gilt edges. Some books, also, are\r\nexceptionally costly because bound in a style of superior elegance and\r\nbeauty, or as having belonged to a crowned head or a noble person,\r\n(\"books with a pedigree\") or an eminent author, or having autographs of\r\nnotable characters on the fly-leaves or title-pages, or original letters\r\ninserted in the volume. Others still are \"extra-illustrated\" works, in\r\nwhich one volume is swelled to several by the insertion of a multitude of\r\nportraits, autographs, and engravings, more or less illustrative of the\r\ncontents of the book. This is called \"Grangerising,\" from its origin in\r\nthe practice of thus illustrating Granger's Biographical History of\r\nEngland. Book amateurs of expensive tastes are by no means rare,\r\nespecially in England, France, and America, and the great commercial\r\nvalue placed upon uncut and rarely beautiful books, on which the highest\r\narts of the printer and book-binder have been lavished, evinces the fact.\r\n\r\n(6) The books emanating from the presses of famous printers are more\r\nsought for by collectors and libraries than other publications, because\r\nof their superior excellence. Sometimes this is found in the beauty of\r\nthe type, or the clear and elegant press-work; sometimes in the printers'\r\nmarks, monograms, engraved initial letters, head and tail-pieces, or\r\nother illustrations; and sometimes in the fine quality of the choice\r\npaper on which the books are printed. Thus, the productions of the\r\npresses of Aldus, Giunta, Bodoni, Etienne, Elzevir, Froben, Gutenberg,\r\nFust and Schoeffer, Plantin, Caxton, Wynkyn de Worde, Bulmer, Didot,\r\nBaskerville, Pickering, Whittingham, and others, are always in demand,\r\nand some of the choicer specimens of their art, if in fine condition,\r\nbring great prices in the second-hand book-shops, or the auction room. An\r\nexample of Caxton's press is now almost unattainable, except in\r\nfragmentary copies. There are known to be only about 560 examples of\r\nCaxtons in the world, four-fifths of which are in England, and thirty-one\r\nof these are unique. His \"King Arthur\" (1485) brought £1950 at auction in\r\n1885, and the Polychronicon (1482) was sold at the Ives sale (N. Y.) in\r\n1891, for $1,500.\r\n\r\n(7) In the case of all finely illustrated works, the earlier impressions\r\ntaken, both of text and plates, are more rare, and hence more valuable,\r\nthan the bulk of the edition. Thus, copies with \"proofs before letters\"\r\nof the steel engravings or etchings, sometimes command more than double\r\nthe price of copies having only the ordinary plates. Each added\r\nimpression deteriorates a little the sharp, clear outlines and brilliant\r\nimpressions which are peculiar to the first copies printed.\r\n\r\n(8) Of some books, certain volumes only are rare, and very costly in\r\nconsequence. Thus, Burk's History of Virginia is common enough in three\r\nvolumes, but volume 4 of the set, by Jones and Girardin, (1816,) is\r\nexceedingly rare, and seldom found with the others. The fifth and last\r\nvolume of Bunsen's Egypt's Place in Universal History is very scarce,\r\nwhile the others are readily procured. Of De Bry's Voyages, the 13th or\r\nfinal part of the American voyages is so rare as to be quite\r\nunattainable, unless after long years of search, and at an unconscionable\r\nprice.\r\n\r\n(9) The condition of any book is an unfailing factor in its price. Many,\r\nif not most books offered by second-hand dealers are shop-worn, soiled,\r\nor with broken bindings, or some other defect. A pure, clean copy, in\r\nhandsome condition without and within, commands invariably an extra\r\nprice. Thus the noted Nuremberg Chronicle of 1493, a huge portly folio,\r\nwith 2,250 wood-cuts in the text, many of them by Albert Dürer or other\r\nearly artists, is priced in London catalogues all the way from £7.15 up\r\nto £35, for identically the same edition. The difference is dependent\r\nwholly on the condition of the copies offered. Here is part of a\r\ndescription of the best copy: \"Nuremberg Chronicle, by Schedel, printed\r\nby Koberger, first edition, 1493, royal folio, with fine original\r\nimpressions of the 2,250 large wood-cuts of towns, historical events,\r\nportraits, etc., very tall copy, measuring 18½ inches by 12½, beautifully\r\nbound in morocco super extra, full gilt edges, by Riviere, £35. All the\r\ncuts are brilliant impressions, large and spirited. The book is genuine\r\nand perfect throughout; _no washed leaves_, and all the large capitals\r\nfilled in by the rubricator by different colored inks: it has the six\r\nadditional leaves at end, which Brunet says are nearly always wanting.\"\r\n\r\n(10) The first editions printed of many books always command high prices.\r\nNot only is this true of the _editio princeps_ of Homer, Virgil, Tacitus\r\nand other Greek and Roman writers, published in the infancy of printing,\r\nbut of every noted author, of ancient or modern date. The edition printed\r\nduring the life of the writer has had his own oversight and correction.\r\nAnd when more than one issue of his book has thus appeared, one sees how\r\nhis maturer judgment has altered the substance or the style of his work.\r\nFirst editions of any very successful work always tend to become scarce,\r\nsince the number printed is smaller, as a rule, and a large part of the\r\nissue is absorbed by public libraries. The earliest published writings of\r\nTennyson, now found with difficulty, show how much of emendation and\r\nomission this great poet thought proper to make in his poems in after\r\nyears. A first edition of Ivanhoe, 3 vols., 1820, brings £7 or more, in\r\nthe original boards, but if rebound in any style, the first Waverley\r\nnovels can be had at much less, though collectors are many.\r\n\r\n(11) Another class of rare books is found in many local histories, both\r\namong the county histories of Great Britain, and those of towns and\r\ncounties in the United States. Jay Gould's History of Delaware County, N.\r\nY., published in 1856, and sought after in later times because of his\r\nnote as a financier, is seldom found. Of family genealogies, too, printed\r\nin small editions, there are many which cannot be had at all, and many\r\nmore which have risen to double or even quadruple price. The market value\r\nof these books, always dependent on demand, is enhanced by the wants of\r\npublic libraries which are making or completing collections of these much\r\nsought sources of information.\r\n\r\n(12) There is a class of books rarely found in any reputable book shop,\r\nand which ought to be much rarer than they are--namely, those that belong\r\nto the domain of indecent literature. Booksellers who deal in such wares\r\noften put them in catalogues under the head of _facetiae_, thus making a\r\nvile use of what should be characteristic only of books of wit or humor.\r\nMen of prurient tastes become collectors of such books, many of which are\r\nnot without some literary merit, while many more are neither fit to be\r\nwritten, nor printed, nor read.\r\n\r\n(13) There is a large variety of books that are sought mainly on account,\r\nnot of their authors, nor for their value as literature, but for their\r\nillustrators. Many eminent artists (in fact most of those of any period)\r\nhave made designs for certain books of their day. The reputation of an\r\nartist sometimes rests more upon his work given to the public in\r\nengravings, etchings, wood-cuts, etc., that illustrate books, than upon\r\nhis works on canvas or in marble. Many finely illustrated works bear\r\nprices enhanced by the eagerness of collectors, who are bent upon\r\npossessing the designs of some favorite artist, while some amateurs covet\r\na collection of far wider scope. This demand, although fitful, and\r\nsometimes evanescent, (though more frequently recurrent,) lessens the\r\nsupply of illustrated books, and with the constant drafts of new\r\nlibraries, raises prices. Turner's exquisite pictures in Rogers's Italy\r\nand Poems (1830-34) have floated into fame books of verse which find very\r\nfew readers. Hablot K. Browne (\"Phiz\") designed those immortal Wellers in\r\nPickwick, which have delighted two whole generations of readers. The\r\n\"Cruikshankiana\" are sought with avidity, in whatever numerous volumes\r\nthey adorn. Books illustrated with the designs of Bartolozzi, Marillier,\r\nEisen, Gravelot, Moreau, Johannot, Grandville, Rowlandson, Bewick,\r\nWilliam Blake, Stothard, Stanfield, Harvey, Martin, Cattermole, Birket\r\nFoster, Mulready, Tenniel, Maclise, Gilbert, Dalziel, Leighton, Holman\r\nHunt, Doyle, Leech, Millais, Rossetti, Linton, Du Maurier, Sambourne,\r\nCaldecott, Walter Crane, Kate Greenaway, Haden, Hamerton, Whistler, Doré,\r\nAnderson, Darley, Matt Morgan, Thos. Nast, Vedder, and others, are in\r\nconstant demand, especially for the early impressions of books in which\r\ntheir designs appear.\r\n\r\n(14) Finally, that extensive class of books known as early _Americana_\r\nhave been steadily growing rarer, and rising in commercial value, since\r\nabout the middle of the nineteenth century. Books and pamphlets relating\r\nto any part of the American continent or islands, the first voyages,\r\ndiscoveries, narratives or histories of those regions, which were hardly\r\nnoted or cared for a century ago, are now eagerly sought by collectors\r\nfor libraries both public and private. In this field, the keen\r\ncompetition of American Historical Societies, and of several great\r\nlibraries, besides the ever increasing number of private collectors with\r\nlarge means, has notably enhanced the prices of all desirable and rare\r\nbooks. Nor do the many reprints which have appeared much affect the\r\nmarket value of the originals, or first editions.\r\n\r\nThis rise in prices, while far from uniform, and furnishing many examples\r\nof isolated extravagance, has been marked. Witness some examples. The\r\n\"Bay Psalm Book,\" Cambridge, Mass., A. D. 1640, is the Caxton of New\r\nEngland, so rare that no perfect copy has been found for many years. In\r\n1855, Henry Stevens had the singular good fortune to find this\r\ntypographical gem sandwiched in an odd bundle of old hymn books, unknown\r\nto the auctioneers or catalogue, at a London book sale. Keeping his own\r\ncounsel, he bid off the lot at nine shillings, completed an imperfection\r\nin the book, from another imperfect copy, had it bound in Bedford's best,\r\nand sold it to Mr. Lenox's library at £80. In 1868, Stevens sold another\r\ncopy to George Brinley for 150 guineas, which was bought for $1,200 in\r\n1878, by C. Vanderbilt, at the Brinley sale.\r\n\r\nJohn Smith's folio \"Historie of Virginia,\" 1st ed., 1624, large paper,\r\nwas sold to Brinley in 1874 at $1,275, and re-sold in 1878 for $1,800 to\r\nMr. Lenox. In 1884 a copy on large paper brought £605 at the Hamilton\r\nLibrary sale in London. In 1899, a perfect copy of the large paper\r\nedition was presented to the Library of Congress by Gen. W. B. Franklin.\r\nPerfect copies of Smith's Virginia of 1624 on small paper have sold for\r\n$1,000, and those wanting some maps at $70 to $150.\r\n\r\nThe earlier English tracts relating to Virginia and New England, printed\r\nbetween 1608 and 1700, command large prices: _e. g._, Lescarbot's New\r\nFrance, [Canada,] 1609, $50 to $150; Wood's New England's Prospect, 1635,\r\n$50 to $320; Hubbard's Present State of New England, Boston, 1677, $180\r\nto $316.\r\n\r\nIt is curious to note, in contrast, the following record of prices at the\r\nsale of Dr. Bernard's Library in London, in 1686:\r\n\r\nT. Morton's New England, 1615, eight pence; Lescarbot's New France, 1609,\r\nten pence; Wood's New England's Prospect, 1635, and three others, 5 s. 8\r\nd.; nine Eliot Tracts, &c., 5 s. 2 d.; Hubbard's Present State of New\r\nEngland, 1677, 1 s.; Smith's Historie of Virginia, 1624, 4 s. 2 d.\r\n\r\nThe numerous and now rare works of Increase and Cotton Mather, printed\r\nfrom 1667 to 1728, though mostly sermons, are collected by a sufficient\r\nnumber of libraries to maintain prices at from $4 to $25 each, according\r\nto condition. They number over 470 volumes.\r\n\r\nSeveral collections have been attempted of Frankliniana, or works printed\r\nat Benjamin Franklin's press, and of the many editions of his writings,\r\nwith all books concerning the illustrious printer-statesman of America.\r\nHis \"Poor Richard's Almanacs,\" printed by him from 1733 to 1758, and by\r\nsuccessors to 1798, are so rare that Mr. P. L. Ford found a visit to\r\nthree cities requisite to see all of them. The Library of Congress\r\npossesses thirty-five years of these issues.\r\n\r\nA word may be added as to early newspapers, of some special numbers of\r\nwhich prices that are literally \"fabulous\" are recorded. There are many\r\nreprints afloat of the first American newspaper, and most librarians have\r\nfrequent offers of the Ulster County, (N. Y.) Gazette of Jan. 10, 1800,\r\nin mourning for the death of Washington, a genuine copy of which is worth\r\nmoney, but the many spurious reprints (which include all those offered)\r\nare worth nothing.\r\n\r\nOf many rare early books reprints or facsimiles are rife in the market,\r\nespecially of those having but few leaves; these, however, are easily\r\ndetected by an expert eye, and need deceive no one.\r\n\r\nOf some scarce books, it may be said that they are as rare as the\r\nindividuals who want them: and of a very few, that they are as rare as\r\nthe extinct dodo. In fact, volumes have been written concerning extinct\r\nbooks, not without interest to the bibliomaniac who is fired with the\r\npassion for possessing something which no one else has got. Some books\r\nare quite as worthless as they are rare. But books deemed worthless by\r\nthe common or even by the enlightened mind are cherished as treasures by\r\nmany collectors. The cook-book, entitled _Le Pastissier françois_, an\r\nElzevir of 1655, is so rare as to have brought several times its weight\r\nin gold. Nearly all the copies of some books have been worn to rags by\r\nanglers, devout women, cooks, or children.\r\n\r\nWhen a book is sold at a great price as \"very rare,\" it often happens\r\nthat several copies come into the market soon after, and, there being no\r\ndemand, the commercial value is correspondingly depressed. The books most\r\nsure of maintaining full prices are first editions of master-pieces in\r\nliterature. Fitzgerald's version of Omar Khayyam was bought by nobody\r\nwhen Quaritch first published it in 1859. After eight years, he put the\r\nremainder of the edition,--a paper-covered volume--down to a penny each.\r\nWhen the book had grown into fame, and the many variations in later\r\nissues were discovered, this first edition, no longer procurable, rose to\r\n£21, the price actually paid by Mr. Quaritch himself at a book auction in\r\n1898!\r\n\r\nAuction sales of libraries having many rare books have been frequent in\r\nLondon and Paris. The largest price yet obtained for any library was\r\nreached in 1882-3, when that of Mr. Wm. Beckford brought £73,551, being\r\nan average of nearly $40 a volume. But W. C. Hazlitt says of this sale,\r\n\"the Beckford books realized perfectly insane prices, and were afterwards\r\nre-sold for a sixth or even tenth of the amount, to the serious loss of\r\nsomebody, when the barometer had fallen.\"\r\n\r\nThe second-hand bookseller, having the whole range of printed literature\r\nfor his field, has a great advantage in dealing with book collectors over\r\nthe average dealer, who has to offer only new books, or such as are \"in\r\nprint.\"\r\n\r\nIt may be owned that the love of rare books is chiefly sentimental. He\r\nwho delights to spend his days or his nights in the contemplation of\r\nblack-letter volumes, quaint title-pages, fine old bindings, and curious\r\nearly illustrations, may not add to the knowledge or the happiness of\r\nmankind, but he makes sure of his own.\r\n\r\nThe passion for rare books, merely because of their rarity, is a low\r\norder of the taste for books. But the desire to possess and read wise old\r\nbooks which have been touched by the hoar frost of time is of a higher\r\nmood. The first impression of Paradise Lost (1667) with its quarto page\r\nand antique orthography, is it not more redolent of the author's age than\r\nthe elegant Pickering edition, or the one illustrated by John Martin or\r\nGustave Doré? When you hold in your hand Shakespeare's \"Midsommer Night's\r\nDream\" (A. D. 1600) and read with fresh admiration and delight the\r\nexquisite speeches of Oberon and Titania, may not the thought that\r\nperhaps that very copy may once have been held in the immortal bard's own\r\nhand send a thrill through your own?\r\n\r\nWhen you turn over the classic pages of Homer illustrated by Flaxman,\r\nthat \"dear sculptor of eternity,\" as William Blake called him, or drink\r\nin the beauty of those delicious landscapes of Turner, that astonishing\r\nman, who shall wonder at your desire to possess them?\r\n\r\nThe genuine book lover is he who reads books; who values them for what\r\nthey contain, not for their rarity, nor for the preposterous prices which\r\nhave been paid for them. To him, book-hunting is an ever-enduring\r\ndelight. Of all the pleasures tasted here below, that of the book lover\r\nin finding a precious and long sought volume is one of the purest and\r\nmost innocent. In books, he becomes master of all the kingdoms of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 27.\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the book collector and the Librarian, books of bibliography are the\r\ntools of the profession. Without them he would be lost in a maze of\r\nliterature without a clue. With them, his path is plain, and, in exact\r\nproportion to his acquaintance with them, will his knowledge and\r\nusefulness extend. Bibliography may be defined as the science which\r\ntreats of books, of their authors, subjects, history, classification,\r\ncataloguing, typography, materials (including paper, printing and\r\nbinding) dates, editions, etc. This compound word, derived from two Greek\r\nroots, _Biblion_, book, and _graphein_, to write, has many analogous\r\nwords, some of which, ignorantly used to express a bibliographer, may be\r\nset down for distinction: as, for example--Bibliopole--a seller of books,\r\noften erroneously applied to a librarian, who buys but never sells:\r\nBibliophile, a lover of books, a title which he should always exemplify:\r\nBibliopegist, a book-binder: Bibliolater, a worshipper of books:\r\nBibliophobe, a hater of books: Bibliotaph, a burier of books--one who\r\nhides or conceals them: Bibliomaniac, or bibliomane, one who has a mania\r\nor passion for collecting books. (Bibliomania, some one has said, is a\r\ndisease: Bibliophily is a science: The first is a parody of the second.)\r\nBibliophage, or bibliophagist, a book-eater, or devourer of books.\r\nBibliognost, one versed in the science of books. Biblioklept, a book\r\nthief. (This, you perceive, is from the same Greek root as kleptomaniac.)\r\nBibliogist, one learned about books, (the same nearly as bibliographer);\r\nand finally, Bibliothecary, a librarian.\r\n\r\nThis brings me to say, in supplementing this elementary list (needless\r\nfor some readers) that _Bibliotheca_ is Latin for a library;\r\n_Bibliothèque_ is French for the same; _Bibliothécaire_ is French for\r\nLibrarian, while the French word _Libraire_ means book seller or\r\npublisher, though often mistaken by otherwise intelligent persons, for\r\nlibrarian, or library.\r\n\r\nThe word \"bibliotechny\" is not found in any English dictionary known to\r\nme, although long in use in its equivalent forms in France and Germany.\r\nIt means all that belongs to the knowledge of the book, to its handling,\r\ncataloguing, and its arrangement upon the shelves of a library. It is\r\nalso applied to the science of the formation of libraries, and their\r\ncomplete organization. It is employed in the widest and most extended\r\nsense of what may be termed material or physical bibliography.\r\nBibliotechny applies, that is to say, to the technics of the librarian's\r\nwork--to the outside of the books rather than the inside--to the\r\nmechanics, not the metaphysics of the profession. The French word\r\n\"_Bibliothéconomie_,\" much in use of late years, signifies much the same\r\nthing as _Bibliotechnie_, and we translate it, not into one word, but\r\ntwo, calling it \"library economy.\" This word \"economy\" is not used in the\r\nmost current sense--as significant of saving--but in the broad, modern\r\nsense of systematic order, or arrangement.\r\n\r\nThere are two other words which have found their way into Murray's Oxford\r\nDictionary, the most copious repository of English words, with\r\nillustrations of their origin and history, ever published, namely,\r\nBiblioclast--a destroyer of books (from the same final root as\r\niconoclast) and Bibliogony, the production of books. I will add that out\r\nof the fifteen or more words cited as analogous to Bibliography, only\r\nthree are found used earlier than the last quarter century, the first use\r\nof most having been this side of 1880. This is a striking instance of the\r\nphenomenal growth of new words in our already rich and flexible English\r\ntongue. Carlyle even has the word \"Bibliopoesy,\" the making of\r\nbooks,--from _Biblion_, and _poiein_--to make.\r\n\r\nPublic libraries are useful to readers in proportion to the extent and\r\nready supply of the helps they furnish to facilitate researches of every\r\nkind. Among these helps a wisely selected collection of books of\r\nreference stands foremost. Considering the vast extent and opulence of\r\nthe world of letters, and the want of experience of the majority of\r\nreaders in exploring this almost boundless field, the importance of every\r\nkey which can unlock its hidden stores becomes apparent. The printed\r\ncatalogue of no single library is at all adequate to supply full\r\nreferences, even to its own stores of knowledge; while these catalogues\r\nare, of course, comparatively useless as to other stores of information,\r\nelsewhere existing. Even the completest and most extensive catalogue in\r\nthe world, that of the British Museum Library, although now extended to\r\nmore than 370 folio volumes in print, representing 3,000 volumes in\r\nmanuscript, is not completed so as to embrace the entire contents of that\r\nrich repository of knowledge.\r\n\r\nFrom lack of information of the aid furnished by adequate books of\r\nreference in a special field, many a reader goes groping in pursuit of\r\nreferences or information which might be found in some one of the many\r\nvolumes which may be designated as works of bibliography. The diffidence\r\nand reserve of many students in libraries, and the mistaken fear of\r\ngiving trouble to librarians, frequently deprives them of even those aids\r\nwhich a few words of inquiry might bring forth from the ready knowledge\r\nof the custodians in charge.\r\n\r\nThat is the best library, and he is the most useful librarian, by whose\r\naid every reader is enabled to put his finger on the fact he wants, just\r\nwhen it is wanted. In attaining this end it is essential that the more\r\nrecent, important, and valuable aids to research in general science, as\r\nwell as in special departments of each, should form a part of the\r\nlibrary. In order to make a fit selection of books (and all libraries are\r\npractically reduced to a selection, from want of means to possess the\r\nwhole) it is indispensable to know the relative value of the books\r\nconcerned. Many works of reference of great fame, and once of great\r\nvalue, have become almost obsolete, through the issue of more extensive\r\nand carefully edited works in the same field. While a great and\r\ncomprehensive library should possess every work of reference, old or new,\r\nwhich has aided or may aid the researches of scholars, (not forgetting\r\neven the earlier editions of works often reprinted), the smaller\r\nlibraries, on the other hand, are compelled to exercise a close economy\r\nof selection. The most valuable works of reference, among which the more\r\ncopious and extensive bibliographies stand first, are frequently\r\nexpensive treasures, and it is important to the librarian furnishing a\r\nlimited and select library to know what books he can best afford to do\r\nwithout. If he cannot buy both the _Manuel du libraire_ by Brunet, in\r\nfive volumes, and the _Trésor des livres rares et précieux_ of Graesse,\r\nseven volumes, both of which are dictionaries of the choicer portions of\r\nliterature, it is important to know that Brunet is the more indispensable\r\nof the two. From the 20,000 reference books lying open to the\r\nconsultation of all readers in the great rotunda of the British Museum\r\nreading room, to the small and select case of dictionaries, catalogues,\r\ncyclopaedias, and other works of reference in a town or subscription\r\nlibrary, the interval is wide indeed. But where we cannot have all, it\r\nbecomes the more important to have the best; and the reader who has at\r\nhand for ready reference the latest and most copious dictionary of each\r\nof the leading languages of the world, two or three of the best general\r\nbibliographies, the most copious catalogue raisonné of the literature in\r\neach great department of science, the best biographical dictionaries, and\r\nthe latest and most copious encyclopaedias issued from the press, is\r\ntolerably well equipped for the prosecution of his researches.\r\n\r\nNext in importance to the possession in any library of a good selection\r\nof the most useful books of reference, is the convenient accessibility of\r\nthese works to the reading public. Just in proportion to the\r\nindispensability and frequency of use of any work should be the facility\r\nto the reader of availing himself of its aid. The leading encyclopaedias,\r\nbibliographies, dictionaries, annuals, and other books of reference\r\nshould never be locked up in cases, nor placed on high or remote shelves.\r\nThere should be in every library what may be termed a central bureau of\r\nreference. Here should be assembled, whether on circular cases made to\r\nrevolve on a pivot, or on a rectangular case, with volumes covering both\r\nsides, or in a central alcove forming a portion of the shelves of the\r\nmain library, all those books of reference, and volumes incessantly\r\nneeded by students in pursuit of their various inquiries. It is important\r\nthat the custodians of all libraries should remember that this ready and\r\nconvenient supply of the reference books most constantly wanted, serves\r\nthe double object of economizing the time of the librarian and assistants\r\nfor other labor, and of accommodating in the highest degree the readers,\r\nwhose time is also economized. The misplacement of volumes which will\r\nthus occur is easily rectified, while the possibility of loss through\r\nabstraction is so extremely small that it should not be permitted to\r\nweigh for a moment in comparison with the great advantages resulting from\r\nthe rule of liberality in aiding the wants of readers.\r\n\r\nBibliography, in its most intimate sense, is the proper science of the\r\nlibrarian. To many it is a study--to some, it is a passion. While the\r\nbest works in bibliography have not always been written by librarians,\r\nbut by scholars enamored of the science of books, and devotees of\r\nlearning, it is safe to say that the great catalogues which afford such\r\ninestimable aid to research, have nearly all been prepared in libraries,\r\nand not one of the books worthy of the name of bibliography, could have\r\nbeen written without their aid.\r\n\r\nIn viewing the extensive field of bibliographies, regard for systematic\r\ntreatment requires that they be divided into classes. Beginning first\r\nwith general bibliographies, or those claiming to be universal, we should\r\nafterwards consider the numerous bibliographies of countries, or those\r\ndevoted to national literature; following that by the still more numerous\r\nspecial bibliographies, or those embracing works on specially designated\r\nsubjects. The two classes last named are by far the most numerous.\r\n\r\nAlthough what may be termed a \"universal catalogue\" has been the dream of\r\nscholars for many ages, it is as far as ever from being realized--and in\r\nfact much farther than ever before, since each year that is added to the\r\nlong roll of the past increases enormously the number of books to be\r\ndealt with, and consequently the difficulties of the problem. We may set\r\ndown the publication of a work which should contain the titles of all\r\nbooks ever printed, as a practical impossibility. The world's literature\r\nis too vast and complex to be completely catalogued, whether on the\r\ncoöperative plan, or any other. Meanwhile the many thousands of volumes,\r\neach of which has been devoted to some portion of the vast and\r\never-increasing stores of literature and science which human brains have\r\nput in print, will serve to aid the researches of the student, when\r\nrightly guided by an intelligent librarian.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the hopeless nature of the quest, it is true that some\r\nmen of learning have essayed what have been termed universal\r\nbibliographies. The earliest attempt in this direction was published at\r\nZürich in 1545, under the title of \"Bibliotheca Universalis,\" by Conrad\r\nGesner, a Swiss scholar whose acquisition of knowledge was so extensive\r\nthat he was styled \"a miracle of learning.\" This great work gave the\r\ntitles of all books of which its author could find trace, and was\r\nillustrated by a mass of bibliographical notes and criticism. It long\r\nheld a high place in the world of letters, though it is now seldom\r\nreferred to in the plethora of more modern works of bibliography. In\r\n1625, the bookseller B. Ostern put forth at Frankfort, his _Bibliothèque\r\nUniverselle_, a catalogue of all books from 1500 to 1624. In 1742, Th.\r\nGeorgi issued in eleven folio volumes, his _Allgemeines Europäisches_\r\n_Bücher-lexikon_, claiming to represent the works of nearly all writers\r\nfrom 1500 down to 1739. This formidable catalogue may perhaps be said to\r\nembrace more forgotten books than any other in the literary history of\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nAlmost equally formidable, however, is the bibliography of that erudite\r\nscholar, Christian G. Jöcher, who put forth in 1750, at Leipzig, his\r\n_Allgemeines Gelehrten-lexicon_, in which, says the title page, \"the\r\nlearned men of all classes who have lived from the beginning of the world\r\nup to the present time, are described.\" This book, with its supplement,\r\nby Adelung and Rotermund, (completed only to letter R), makes ten\r\nponderous quarto volumes, and may fairly be styled a thesaurus of the\r\nbirth and death of ancient scholars and their works. It is still largely\r\nused in great libraries, to identify the period and the full names of\r\nmany obscure writers of books, who are not commemorated in the catalogues\r\nof universal bibliography, compiled on a more restrictive plan.\r\n\r\nWe come now to the notable catalogues of early-printed books, which aim\r\nto cover all the issues of the press from the first invention of\r\nprinting, up to a certain period. One of the most carefully edited and\r\nmost readily useful of these is Hain, (L.) _Repertorium Bibliographicum_,\r\nin four small and portable octavo volumes, published at Stuttgart in\r\n1826-38. This gives, in an alphabet of authors, all the publications\r\nfound printed (with their variations and new editions), from A. D. 1450\r\nto A. D. 1500.\r\n\r\nMore extensive is the great catalogue of G. W. Panzer, entitled _Annales\r\nTypographici_, in eleven quarto volumes, published at Nuremberg from 1793\r\nto 1803. This work, which covers the period from 1457 (the period of the\r\nfirst book ever printed with a date) up to A. D. 1536, is not arranged\r\nalphabetically (as in Hain's Repertorium) by the names of authors, but in\r\nthe order of the cities or places where the books catalogued were\r\nprinted. The bibliography thus brings together in one view, the\r\ntypographical product of each city or town for about eighty years after\r\nthe earliest dated issues of the press, arranged in chronological order\r\nof the years when printed. This system has undeniable advantages, but\r\nequally obvious defects, which are sought to be remedied by many copious\r\nindexes of authors and printers.\r\n\r\nNext in importance comes M. Maittaire's _Annales Typographici, ab artis\r\ninventae origine ad annum 1664_, printed at The Hague (Hagae Comitum) and\r\ncompleted at London, from 1722-89, in eleven volumes, quarto, often bound\r\nin five volumes. There is besides, devoted to the early printed\r\nliterature of the world, the useful three volume bibliography by La Serna\r\nde Santander, published at Brussels in 1805, entitled _Dictionnaire\r\nbibliographique choisie du quinzième siècle_, Bruxelles, 1803, embracing\r\na selection of what its compiler deemed the more important books\r\npublished from the beginning of printing up to A. D. 1500. All the four\r\nworks last named contain the titles and descriptions of what are known as\r\n_incunabula_, or cradle-books (from Latin _cunabula_, a cradle) a term\r\napplied to all works produced in the infancy of printing, and most\r\ncommonly to those appearing before 1500. These books are also sometimes\r\ncalled fifteeners, or 15th century books.\r\n\r\nOf general bibliographies of later date, only a few of the most useful\r\nand important can here be named. At the head of these stands, deservedly,\r\nthe great work of J. C. Brunet, entitled _Manuel du Libraire et de\r\nl'amateur des livres_, the last or 5th edition of which appeared at Paris\r\nin 1860-64, in five thick octavo volumes. The first edition of Brunet\r\nappeared in 1810, and every issue since has exhibited not only an\r\nextensive enlargement, but great improvement in careful, critical\r\neditorship. It embraces most of the choicest books that have appeared in\r\nthe principal languages of Europe, and a supplement in two volumes, by P.\r\nDeschamps and G. Brunet, appeared in 1878.\r\n\r\nNext to Brunet in importance to the librarian, is J. G. T. Graesse's\r\n_Trésor des Livres rares et précieux_, which is more full than Brunet in\r\nworks in the Teutonic languages, and was published at Dresden in six\r\nquarto volumes, with a supplement, in 1861-69. Both of these\r\nbibliographies aim at a universal range, though they make a selection of\r\nthe best authors and editions, ancient and modern, omitting however, the\r\nmost recent writers. The arrangement of both is strictly alphabetical, or\r\na dictionary of authors' names, while Brunet gives in a final volume a\r\nclassification by subjects. Both catalogues are rendered additionally\r\nvaluable by the citation of prices at which many of the works catalogued\r\nhave been sold at book auctions in the present century.\r\n\r\nIn 1857 was published at Paris a kind of universal bibliography, on the\r\nplan of a _catalogue raisonné_, or dictionary of subjects, by Messrs. F.\r\nDenis, Pinçon, and De Martonne, two of whom were librarians by\r\nprofession. This work of over 700 pages, though printed in almost\r\nmicroscopic type, and now about forty years in arrears, has much value as\r\na ready key to the best books then known on nearly every subject in\r\nscience and literature. It is arranged in a complete index of topics, the\r\nbooks under each being described in chronological order, instead of the\r\nalphabetical. The preponderance is given to the French in the works cited\r\non most subjects, but the literature of other nations is by no means\r\nneglected. It is entitled _Nouveau Manuel de Bibliographie universelle_,\r\nand being a subjective index, while Brunet and Graesse are arranged by\r\nauthors' names, it may be used to advantage in connection with these\r\nstandard bibliographies.\r\n\r\nWhile on this subject, let me name the books specially devoted to lists\r\nof bibliographical works--general and special. These may be termed the\r\ncatalogues of catalogues,--and are highly useful aids, indeed\r\nindispensable to the librarian, who seeks to know what lists of books\r\nhave appeared that are devoted to the titles of publications covering any\r\nperiod, or country, or special subject in the whole circle of sciences or\r\nliteratures. The first notably important book of reference in this field,\r\nwas the work of that most industrious bibliographer, Gabriel Peignot, who\r\npublished at Paris, in 1812, his _Repertoire bibliographique\r\nuniverselle_, in one volume. This work contains the titles of most\r\nspecial bibliographies, of whatever subject or country, published up to\r\n1812, and of many works bibliographical in character, devoted to literary\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nDr. Julius Petzholdt, one of the most learned and laborious of\r\nlibrarians, issued at Leipzig in 1866, a _Bibliotheca bibliographica_,\r\nthe fuller title of which was \"a critical catalogue, exhibiting in\r\nsystematic order, the entire field of bibliography covering the\r\nliterature of Germany and other countries.\" The rather ambitious promise\r\nof this title is well redeemed in the contents: for very few catalogues\r\nof importance issued before 1866, are omitted in this elaborate book of\r\n931 closely printed pages. Most titles of the bibliographies given are\r\nfollowed by critical and explanatory notes, of much value to the\r\nunskilled reader. These notes are in German, while all the titles cited\r\nare in the language of the books themselves. After giving full titles of\r\nall the books in general bibliography, he takes up the national\r\nbibliographies by countries, citing both systematic catalogues and\r\nperiodicals devoted to the literature of each in any period. This is\r\nfollowed by a distributive list of scientific bibliographies, so full as\r\nto leave little to be desired, except for later issues of the press. One\r\nof the curiosities of this work is its catalogue of all the issues of the\r\n\"Index Librorum Prohibitorum\", or books forbidden to be read, including\r\n185 separate catalogues, from A. D. 1510 to A. D. 1862.\r\n\r\nThe next bibliographical work claiming to cover this field was in the\r\nFrench language, being the _Bibliographie des bibliographies_ of Léon\r\nVallée, published in 1883 at Paris. This book, though beautifully\r\nprinted, is so full of errors, and still fuller of omissions, that it is\r\nregarded by competent scholars as a failure, though still having its uses\r\nto the librarian. It is amazing that any writer should put forth a book\r\nseventeen years after the great and successful work of Petzholdt,\r\npurporting to be a catalogue of bibliographies, and yet fail to record\r\nsuch a multitude of printed contributions to the science of sciences as\r\nVallée has overlooked.\r\n\r\nSome ten years later, or in 1897, there came from the French press, a far\r\nbetter bibliographical work, covering the modern issues of books of\r\nbibliography more especially, with greater fullness and superior plan.\r\nThis is the _Manuel de Bibliographie générale_, by Henri Stein. This work\r\ncontains, in 915 well-printed pages, 1st. a list of universal\r\nbibliographies: 2d. a catalogue of national bibliographies, in\r\nalphabetical order of countries: 3d. a list of classified bibliographies\r\nof subjects, divided into seventeen classes, namely, religious sciences,\r\nphilosophical sciences, juridical, economic, social, and educational\r\nsciences, pure and applied sciences, medical sciences, philology and\r\nbelles lettres, geographical and historical sciences, sciences auxiliary\r\nto history, archaeology and fine arts, music, and biography. Besides\r\nthese extremely useful categories of bibliographical aids, in which the\r\nfreshest publications of catalogues and lists of books in each field are\r\nset forth, M. Stein gives us a complete geographical bibliography of\r\nprinting, on a new plan. This he entitles \"_Géographie bibliographique_,\"\r\nor systematic lists of localities in every part of the world which\r\npossessed a printing press prior to the 19th century. It gives, after the\r\nmodern or current name of each place, the Latin, or ancient name, the\r\ncountry in which located, the year in which the first printed publication\r\nappeared in each place, and finally, the authority for the statement.\r\nThis handy-list of information alone, is worth the cost of the work,\r\nsince it will save much time of the inquirer, in hunting over many\r\nvolumes of Panzer, Maittaire, Hain, Dibdin, Thomas, or other authors on\r\nprinting, to find the origin of the art, or early name of the place where\r\nit was introduced. The work contains, in addition, a general table of the\r\nperiodicals of all countries, (of course not exhaustive) divided into\r\nclasses, and filling seventy-five pages. It closes with a \"repertory of\r\nthe principal libraries of the entire world,\" and with an index to the\r\nwhole work, in which the early names in Latin, of all places where books\r\nwere printed, are interspersed in the alphabet, distinguished by italic\r\ntype, and with the modern name of each town or city affixed. This\r\nadmirable feature will render unnecessary any reference to the _Orbis\r\nLatinus_ of Graesse, or to any other vocabulary of geography, to identify\r\nthe place in which early-printed books appeared. Stein is by no means\r\nfree from errors, and some surprising omissions. One cardinal defect is\r\nthe absence of any full index of authors whose books are cited.\r\n\r\nThere are also quite brief catalogues of works on bibliography in J.\r\nPower's Handy Book about Books, London, 1870, and in J. Sabin's\r\nBibliography: a handy book about books which relate to books, N. Y.,\r\n1877. The latter work is an expansion of the first-named.\r\n\r\nWe come now to the second class of our bibliographies, _viz._: those of\r\nvarious countries. Here the reader must be on his guard not to be misled\r\ninto too general an interpretation of geographical terms. Thus, he will\r\nfind many books and pamphlets ambitiously styled \"_Catalogue\r\nAméricaine_\", which are so far from being general bibliographies of books\r\nrelating to America, that they are merely lists of a few books for sale\r\nby some book-dealer, which have something American in their subject. To\r\nknow what catalogues are comprehensive, and what period they cover, as\r\nwell as the limitations of nearly all of them, is a necessary part of the\r\ntraining of a bibliographer, and is essential to the librarian who would\r\neconomize his time and enlarge his usefulness.\r\n\r\nLet us begin with our own country. Here we are met at the outset by the\r\ngreat paucity of general catalogues of American literature, and the utter\r\nimpossibility of finding any really comprehensive lists of the books\r\npublished in the United States, during certain periods. We can get along\r\ntolerably well for the publications within the last thirty years, which\r\nnearly represent the time since systematic weekly bibliographical\r\njournals have been published, containing lists of the current issues of\r\nbooks. But for the period just before the Civil War, back to the year\r\n1775, or for very nearly a century, we are without any systematic\r\nbibliography of the product of the American press. The fragmentary\r\nattempts which have been made toward supplying an account of what books\r\nhave been published in the United States from the beginning, will\r\nhereafter be briefly noted. At the outset, you are to observe the wide\r\ndistinction that exists between books treating of America, or any part of\r\nit, and books printed in America. The former may have been printed\r\nanywhere, at any time since 1492, and in any language: and to such books,\r\nthe broad significant term \"_Americana_\" may properly be applied, as\r\nimplying books relating to America. But this class of works is wholly\r\ndifferent from that of books written or produced by Americans, or printed\r\nin America. It is these latter that we mean when we lament the want of a\r\ncomprehensive American catalogue. There have been published in the United\r\nStates alone (to go no farther into America at present) thousands of\r\nbooks, whose titles are not found anywhere, except widely scattered in\r\nthe catalogues of libraries, public and private, in which they exist.\r\nNay, there are multitudes of publications which have been issued in this\r\ncountry during the last two hundred years, whose titles cannot be found\r\nanywhere in print. This is not, generally, because the books have\r\nperished utterly,--though this is unquestionably true of some, but\r\nbecause multitudes of books that have appeared, and do appear, wholly\r\nescape the eye of the literary, or critical, or bibliographical\r\nchronicler. It is, beyond doubt true even now, that what are commonly\r\naccepted as complete catalogues of the issues of the press of any year,\r\nare wofully incomplete, and that too, through no fault of their\r\ncompilers. Many works are printed in obscure towns, or in newspaper\r\noffices, which never reach the great eastern cities, where our principal\r\nbibliographies, both periodical and permanent, are prepared. Many books,\r\ntoo, are \"privately printed,\" to gratify the pride or the taste of their\r\nauthors, and a few copies distributed to friends, or sometimes to\r\nselected libraries, or public men. In these cases, not only are the\r\npublic chroniclers of new issues of the press in ignorance of the\r\nprinting of many books, but they are purposely kept in ignorance. Charles\r\nLamb, of humorous and perhaps immortal memory, used to complain of the\r\nmultitudes of books which are no books; and we of to-day may complain, if\r\nwe choose, of the vast number of publications that are not published.\r\n\r\nTake a single example of the failure of even large and imposing volumes\r\nto be included in the \"American Catalogue,\" for whose aid, librarians are\r\nso immeasurably indebted to the enterprise of its publishers. A single\r\npublishing house west of New York, printed and circulated in about four\r\nyears time, no less than thirty-two elaborate and costly histories, of\r\nwestern counties and towns, not one of which was ever recorded by title\r\nin our only comprehensive American bibliography. Why was this? Simply\r\nbecause the works referred to were published only as subscription books,\r\ncirculated by agents, carefully kept out of booksellers' hands, and never\r\nsent to the Eastern press for notice or review. When circumstances like\r\nthese exist as to even very recent American publications (and they are\r\ncontinually happening) is it any wonder that our bibliographies are\r\nincomplete?\r\n\r\nPerhaps some will suggest that there must be one record of American\r\npublications which is complete, namely, the office of Copyright at\r\nWashington. It is true that the titles of all copyright publications are\r\nrequired by law to be there registered, and copies deposited as soon as\r\nprinted. It is also true that a weekly catalogue of all books and other\r\ncopyright publications is printed, and distributed by the Treasury, to\r\nall our custom-houses, to intercept piratical re-prints which might be\r\nimported. But the books just referred to were not entered for copyright\r\nat all, the publishers apparently preferring the risk of any rival's\r\nreprinting them, rather than to incur the cost of the small copyright\r\nfee, and the deposit of copies. In such cases, there is no law requiring\r\npublishers to furnish copies of their books. The government guarantees no\r\nmonopoly of publication, and so cannot exact a _quid pro quo._, however\r\nmuch it might inure to the interest of publisher and author to have the\r\nwork seen and noticed, and preserved beyond risk of perishing (unless\r\nprinted on wood-pulp paper) in the Library of the United States.\r\n\r\nIf such extensive omissions of the titles of books sometimes important,\r\ncan now continually occur in our accepted standards of national\r\nbibliography, what shall we say of times when we had no critical\r\njournals, no publishers' trade organs, and no weekly, nor annual, nor\r\nquinquennial catalogues of American books issued? Must we not allow, in\r\nthe absence of any catalogues worthy of the name, to represent such\r\nperiods, that all our reference books are from the very necessity of the\r\ncase deplorably incomplete? Only by the most devoted, indefatigable and\r\nunrewarded industry have we got such aids to research as to the existence\r\nof American publications, as Haven's Catalogue of American publications\r\nprior to 1776, Sabin's Bibliotheca Americana, and the American Catalogues\r\nof Leypoldt, Bowker, and their coadjutors.\r\n\r\nThese illustrations are cited to guard against the too common error of\r\nsupposing that we have in the numerous American catalogues that exist,\r\neven putting them all together, any full bibliography of the titles of\r\nAmerican books. While it cannot be said that the _lacunae_ or omissions\r\napproach the actual entries in number, it must be allowed that books are\r\nturning up every day, both new and old, whose titles are not found in any\r\ncatalogue. The most important books--those which deserve a name as\r\nliterature, are found recorded somewhere--although even as to many of\r\nthese, one has to search many alphabets, in a large number of volumes,\r\nbefore tracing them, or some editions of them.\r\n\r\nOne principal source of the great number of titles of books found\r\nwanting in American catalogues, is that many books were printed at places\r\nremote from the great cities, and were never announced in the columns of\r\nthe press at all. This is especially true as to books printed toward the\r\nclose of the 18th century, and during the first quarter of the 19th. Not\r\nonly have we no bibliography whatever of American issues of the press,\r\nspecially devoted to covering the long period between 1775 and 1820, but\r\nmultitudes of books printed during that neglected half-century, have\r\nfailed to get into the printed catalogues of our libraries. As\r\nillustrations we might give a long catalogue of places where\r\nbook-publication was long carried on, and many books of more or less\r\nimportance printed or reprinted, but in which towns not a book has been\r\nproduced for more than three-quarters of a century past. One of these\r\ntowns was Winchester, and another Williamsburg, in Virginia; another was\r\nExeter, New Hampshire, and a fourth was Carlisle, Pa. In the last-named\r\nplace, one Archibald Loudon printed many books, between A. D. 1798, and\r\n1813, which have nearly all escaped the chroniclers of American\r\nbook-titles. Notable among the productions of his press, was his own\r\nbook, A History of Indian Wars, or as he styled it in the title page, \"A\r\nselection of some of the most interesting narratives of outrages\r\ncommitted by the Indians in their wars with the white people.\" This\r\nhistory appeared in two volumes from the press of A. Loudon, Carlisle,\r\nPa., in 1808 and 1811. It is so rare that I have failed to find its title\r\nanywhere except in Sabin's Bibliotheca Americana, Field's Indian\r\nBibliography, and the Catalogue of the Library of Congress. Not even the\r\nBritish Museum Library, so rich in Americana, has a copy. Sabin states\r\nthat only six copies are known, and Field styles it, \"this rarest of\r\nbooks on America,\" adding that he could learn of only three perfect\r\ncopies in the world. A Harrisburg reprint of 1888 (100 copies to\r\nsubscribers) is also quite rare.\r\n\r\nContinuing the subject of American bibliography, and still lamenting the\r\nwant of any comprehensive or finished work in that field which is worthy\r\nof the name, let us see what catalogues do exist, even approximating\r\ncompleteness for any period. The earlier years of the production of\r\nAmerican books have been partially covered by the \"Catalogue of\r\npublications in what is now the United States, prior to 1776.\" This list\r\nwas compiled by an indefatigable librarian, the late Samuel F. Haven, who\r\nwas at the head of the Library of the American Antiquarian Society, at\r\nWorcester, Mass. It gives all titles by sequence of years of publication,\r\ninstead of alphabetical order, from 1639 (the epoch of the earliest\r\nprinting in the United States) to the end of 1775. The titles of books\r\nand pamphlets are described with provoking brevity, being generally\r\nlimited to a single line for each, and usually without publishers' names,\r\n(though the places of publication and sometimes the number of pages are\r\ngiven) so that it leaves much to be desired. Notwithstanding this, Mr.\r\nHaven's catalogue is an invaluable aid to the searcher after titles of\r\nthe early printed literature of our country. It appeared at Albany, N.\r\nY., in 1874, as an appendix [in Vol 2] to a new (or second) edition of\r\nIsaiah Thomas's History of Printing in America, which was first published\r\nin 1810. In using it, the librarian will find no difficulty, if he knows\r\nthe year when the publication he looks for appeared, as all books of each\r\nyear are arranged in alphabetical order. But if he knows only the\r\nauthor's name, he may have a long search to trace the title, there being\r\nno general alphabet or index of authors. This chronological arrangement\r\nhas certain advantages to the literary inquirer or historian, while for\r\nready reference, its disadvantages are obvious.\r\n\r\nWhile there were several earlier undertakings of an American bibliography\r\nthan Haven's catalogue of publications before the American revolution,\r\nyet the long period which that list covers, and its importance, entitled\r\nit to first mention here. There had, however, appeared, as early as the\r\nyear 1804, in Boston, \"A Catalogue of all books, printed in the United\r\nStates, with the prices, and places where published, annexed.\" This large\r\npromise is hardly redeemed by the contents of this thin pamphlet of 91\r\npages, all told. Yet the editor goes on to assure us--\r\n\r\n     \"This Catalogue is intended to include all books of general sale\r\n     printed in the United States, whether original, or reprinted;\r\n     that the public may see the rapid progress of book-printing in a\r\n     country, where, twenty years since, scarcely a book was\r\n     published. Local and occasional tracts are generally omitted.\r\n     Some of the books in the Catalogue are now out of print, and\r\n     others are scarce. It is contemplated to publish a new edition of\r\n     this Catalogue, every two years, and to make the necessary\r\n     additions and corrections; and it is hoped the time is not far\r\n     distant, when useful Libraries may be formed of American editions\r\n     of Books, well printed, and handsomely bound.\r\n\r\n     Printed at Boston, for the Book sellers, Jan., 1804.\"\r\n\r\nThe really remarkable thing about this catalogue is that it was the very\r\nfirst bibliographical attempt at a general catalogue, in separate form,\r\nin America. It is quite interesting as an early booksellers' list of\r\nAmerican publications, as well as for its classification, which is as\r\nfollows: \"Law, Physic, Divinity, Bibles, Miscellanies, School Books,\r\nSinging Books, Omissions.\"\r\n\r\nThe fact that no subsequent issues of the catalogue appeared, evinces the\r\nvery small interest taken in bibliographic knowledge in those early days.\r\n\r\nThis curiosity of early American bibliography gives the titles of 1338\r\nbooks, all of American publication, with prices in 1804. Here are\r\nsamples: Bingham's Columbian Orator, 75 cts.: Burney's Cecilia, 3 vols.\r\n$3: Memoirs of Pious Women, $1.12: Belknap's New Hampshire, 3 vols. $5:\r\nMrs. Coghlan's Memoirs, 62½ cts.: Brockden Brown's Wieland, $1:\r\nFederalist, 2 vols. $4.50: Dilworth's Spelling Book, 12½ cts.: Pike's\r\nArithmetic, $2.25.\r\n\r\nThe number of out-of-the-way places in which books were published in\r\nthose days is remarkable. Thus, in Connecticut, we have as issuing books,\r\nLitchfield, New London and Fairhaven: in Massachusetts, Leominster,\r\nDedham, Greenfield, Brookfield, and Wrentham: in New Hampshire, Dover,\r\nWalpole, Portsmouth, and Exeter: in Pennsylvania, Washington, Carlisle,\r\nand Chambersburg: in New Jersey, Morristown, Elizabethtown, and\r\nBurlington. At Alexandria, Va., eight books are recorded as published.\r\n\r\nThis historical nugget of the Boston bookmongers of a century ago is so\r\nrare, that only two copies are known in public libraries, namely, in the\r\nLibrary of Congress, and in that of the Massachusetts Historical Society.\r\nIt was reprinted in 1898, for the Dibdin Club of New York, by Mr. A.\r\nGrowoll, of the Publishers' Weekly, to whose curious and valuable notes\r\non \"Booktrade Bibliography in the United States in the 19th century,\" it\r\nforms a supplement.\r\n\r\nThe next catalogue of note claiming to be an American catalogue, or of\r\nbooks published in America, was put forth in 1847, at Claremont, N. H.,\r\nby Alexander V. Blake. This was entitled, \"The American Bookseller's\r\ncomplete reference trade-list, and alphabetical catalogue of books,\r\npublished in this country, with the publishers' and authors' names, and\r\nprices.\" This quarto volume, making 351 pages (with its supplement issued\r\nin 1848) was the precursor of the now current \"Trade List Annual,\"\r\ncontaining the lists of books published by all publishers whose lists\r\ncould be secured. The titles are very brief, and are arranged in the\r\ncatalogue under the names of the respective publishers, with an\r\nalphabetical index of authors and of anonymous titles at the end. It\r\nserved well its purpose of a book-trade catalogue fifty years ago, being\r\nthe pioneer in that important field. It is now, like the catalogue of\r\n1804, just noticed, chiefly interesting as a bibliographical curiosity,\r\nalthough both lists do contain the titles of some books not elsewhere\r\nfound.\r\n\r\nMr. Orville A. Roorbach, a New York bookseller, was the next compiler of\r\nan American bibliography. His first issue of 1849 was enlarged and\r\npublished in 1852, under this title: \"Bibliotheca Americana: a catalogue\r\nof American publications, including reprints and original works, from\r\n1820 to 1852, inclusive.\" This octavo volume of 663 pages, in large,\r\nclear type, closely abbreviates nearly all titles, though giving in one\r\ncomprehensive alphabet, the authors' names, and the titles of the books\r\nunder the first word, with year and place of publication, publisher's\r\nname, and price at which issued. No collation of the books is given, but\r\nthe catalogue supplies sufficient portions of each title to identify the\r\nbook. It is followed in an appendix by a catalogue of law books, in a\r\nseparate alphabet, and a list of periodicals published in the United\r\nStates in 1852.\r\n\r\nRoorbach continued his catalogue to the year 1861, by the issue of three\r\nsuccessive supplements: (1) covering the American publications of 1853 to\r\n1855: (2) from 1855 to 1858: (3) from 1858 to 1861. These four\r\ncatalogues, aiming to cover, in four different alphabets, the issues of\r\nthe American press for forty years, or from 1820 to 1861, are extremely\r\nuseful lists to the librarian, as finding lists, although the rigorously\r\nabbreviated titles leave very much to be desired by the bibliographer,\r\nand the omissions are exceedingly numerous of books published within the\r\nyears named, but whose titles escaped the compiler.\r\n\r\nFollowing close upon Roorbach's Bibliotheca Americana in chronological\r\norder, we have next two bibliographies covering American book issues\r\nfrom 1861 to 1871. These were compiled by a New York book dealer named\r\nJames Kelly, and were entitled The American Catalogue of Books, (original\r\nand reprint) published in the United States from Jan., 1861, to Jan.,\r\n1866, [and from Jan., 1866, to Jan., 1871] with date of publication,\r\nsize, price, and publisher's name. The first volume contained a\r\nsupplement, with list of pamphlets on the civil war, and also a list of\r\nthe publications of learned societies. These very useful and important\r\ncatalogues cover ten years of American publishing activity, adding also\r\nto their own period many titles omitted by Roorbach in earlier years.\r\nKelly's catalogues number 307 and 444 pages respectively, and, like\r\nRoorbach's, they give both author and title in a single alphabet. Names\r\nof publishers are given, with place and year of publication, and retail\r\nprice, but without number of pages, and with no alphabet of subjects.\r\n\r\nNext after Kelly's catalogue came the first issue of the \"American\r\nCatalogue,\" which, with its successive volumes (all published in quarto\r\nform) ably represents the bibliography of our country during the past\r\ntwenty-five years. The title of the first volume, issued in 1880, reads\r\n\"American Catalogue of books in print and for sale (including reprints\r\nand importations) July 1, 1876. Compiled under direction of F. Leypoldt,\r\nby L. E. Jones.\" This copious repository of book-titles was in two parts:\r\n(1) Authors, and (2) Subject-index. Both are of course in alphabetical\r\norder, and the titles of books are given with considerable abbreviation.\r\nThe fact that its plan includes many titles of books imported from Great\r\nBritain, (as supplying information to book-dealers and book-buyers)\r\nprevents it from being considered as a bibliography of strictly American\r\npublications. Still, it is the only approximately full American\r\nbibliography of the publications current twenty-five years ago. As such,\r\nits volumes are indispensable in every library, and should be in its\r\nearliest purchase of works of reference. The limitation of the catalogue\r\nto books still in print--_i. e._, to be had of the publishers at the time\r\nof its issue, of course precludes it from being ranked as a universal\r\nAmerican bibliography.\r\n\r\nThe first issue in 1880 was followed, in 1885, by the \"American\r\nCatalogue, 1876-1884: books recorded (including reprints and\r\nimportations), under editorial direction of R. R. Bowker, by Miss A. I.\r\nAppleton.\" This appeared in one volume, but with two alphabets; one being\r\nauthors and titles, and the other an alphabet of subjects. As this volume\r\nincluded eight years issues of the American press, the next bibliography\r\npublished covered the next ensuing six years, and included the books\r\nrecorded from July, 1884 to July, 1890. This appeared in 1891, edited\r\nwith care by Miss Appleton and others.\r\n\r\nIn 1896 appeared its successor, the \"American Catalogue, 1890-95.\r\nCompiled under the editorial direction of R. R. Bowker.\" This catalogue\r\nrecords in its first volume, or alphabet of authors: (1) author; (2) size\r\nof book; (3) year of issue; (4) price; (5) publisher's name. The names of\r\nplaces where published are not given with the title, being rendered\r\nunnecessary by the full alphabetical list of publishers which precedes,\r\nand fixes the city or town where each published his books. This same\r\nusage is followed in succeeding issues of the American Catalogue.\r\n\r\nThis indispensable bibliography of recent American books, in addition to\r\nits regular alphabets of authors and titles (the latter under first words\r\nand in the same alphabet with the authors) and the succeeding alphabet of\r\nsubjects, prints a full list of the publications of the United States\r\ngovernment, arranged by departments and bureaus; also a list of the\r\npublications of State governments, of Societies, and of books published\r\nin series.\r\n\r\nThis last issue has 939 pages. Its only defects (aside from its\r\ninevitable omissions of many unrecorded books) are the double alphabet,\r\nand the want of collation, or an indication of the number of pages in\r\neach work, which should follow every title. Its cost in bound form is\r\n$15, at which the two preceding American catalogues 1876-84, and 1884 to\r\n1890 can also be had, while the catalogue of books in print in 1876,\r\npublished in 1880, is quite out of print, though a copy turns up\r\noccasionally from some book-dealer's stock.\r\n\r\nThe American Catalogue has now become a quinquennial issue, gathering the\r\npublications of five years into one alphabet; and it is supplemented at\r\nthe end of every year by the \"Annual American Catalogue,\" started in\r\n1886, which gives, in about 400 pages, in its first alphabet, collations\r\nof the books of the year (a most important feature, unfortunately absent\r\nfrom the quinquennial American Catalogue.) Its second alphabet gives\r\nauthors, titles, and sometimes subject-matters, but without the\r\ndistribution into subject-divisions found in the quinquennial catalogue;\r\nand the titles are greatly abridged from the full record of its first\r\nalphabet. Its price is $3.50 each year.\r\n\r\nAnd this annual, in turn, is made up from the catalogues of titles of all\r\npublications, which appear in the _Publishers' Weekly_, the carefully\r\nedited organ of the book publishing interests in the United States. This\r\nperiodical, which will be found a prime necessity in every library,\r\noriginated in New York, in 1855, as the \"American Publishers' Circular,\"\r\nand has developed into the recognized authority in American publications,\r\nunder the able management of R. R. Bowker and A. Growoll. For three\r\ndollars a year, it supplies weekly and monthly alphabetical lists of\r\nwhatever comes from the press, in book form, as completely as the titles\r\ncan be gathered from every source. It gives valuable notes after most\r\ntitles, defining the scope and idea of the work, with collations,\r\nfeatures which are copied into the Annual American Catalogue.\r\n\r\nI must not omit to mention among American bibliographies, although\r\npublished in London, and edited by a foreigner, Mr. N. Trübner's\r\n\"Bibliographical Guide to American literature: a classed list of books\r\npublished in the United States during the last forty years.\" This book\r\nappeared in 1859, and is a carefully edited bibliography, arranged\r\nsystematically in thirty-two divisions of subjects, filling 714 pages\r\noctavo. It gives under each topic, an alphabet of authors, followed by\r\ntitles of the works, given with approximate fullness, followed by place\r\nand year of publication, but without publishers' names. The number of\r\npages is also given where ascertained, and the price of the work quoted\r\nin sterling English money. This work, by a competent German-English\r\nbook-publisher of London, is preceded by a brief history of American\r\nliterature, and closes with a full index of authors whose works are\r\ncatalogued in it.\r\n\r\nWe come now to by far the most comprehensive and ambitious attempt to\r\ncover not only the wide field of American publications, but the still\r\nmore extensive field of books relating to America, which has ever yet\r\nbeen made. I refer to the \"Bibliotheca Americana; a dictionary of books\r\nrelating to America,\" by Joseph Sabin, begun more than thirty years ago,\r\nin 1868, and still unfinished, its indefatigable compiler having died in\r\n1881, at the age of sixty. This vast bibliographical undertaking was\r\noriginated by a variously-gifted and most energetic man, not a scholar,\r\nbut a bookseller and auctioneer, born in England. Mr. Sabin is said to\r\nhave compiled more catalogues of private libraries that have been\r\nbrought to the auctioneer's hammer, than any man who ever lived in\r\nAmerica. He bought and sold, during nearly twenty years, old and rare\r\nbooks, in a shop in Nassau street, New York, which was the resort of book\r\ncollectors and bibliophiles without number. He made a specialty of\r\nAmericana, and of early printed books in English literature, crossing the\r\nAtlantic twenty-five times to gather fresh stores with which to feed his\r\nhungry American customers. During all these years, he worked steadily at\r\nhis _magnum opus_, the bibliography of America, carrying with him in his\r\nmany journeys and voyages, in cars or on ocean steamships, copy and\r\nproofs of some part of the work. There have been completed about ninety\r\nparts, or eighteen thick volumes of nearly 600 pages each; and since his\r\ndeath the catalogue has been brought down to the letter S, mainly by Mr.\r\nWilberforce Eames, librarian of the Lenox Library, New York. Though its\r\nultimate completion must be regarded as uncertain, the great value to all\r\nlibrarians, and students of American bibliography or history, of the work\r\nso far as issued, can hardly be over-estimated. Mr. Sabin had the benefit\r\nin revising the proofs of most of the work, of the critical knowledge and\r\nlarge experience of Mr. Charles A. Cutter, the librarian of the Boston\r\nAthenaeum Library, whose catalogue of the books in that institution, in\r\nfive goodly volumes, is a monument of bibliographical learning and\r\nindustry. Sabin's Dictionary is well printed, in large, clear type, the\r\ntitles being frequently annotated, and prices at auction sales of the\r\nrarer and earlier books noted. Every known edition of each work is given,\r\nand the initials of public libraries in the United States, to the number\r\nof thirteen, in which the more important works are found, are appended.\r\nIn not a few cases, where no copy was known to the compiler in a public\r\ncollection, but was found in a private library, the initials of its owner\r\nwere given instead.\r\n\r\nThis extensive bibliography was published solely by subscription, only\r\n635 copies being printed at $2.50 a part, so that its cost to those\r\nsubscribing was about $225 unbound, up to the time of its suspension. The\r\nfirst part appeared January 1, 1867, although Vol. I. bears date New\r\nYork, 1868. It records most important titles in full, with (usually)\r\nmarks denoting omissions where such are made. In the case of many rare\r\nbooks relating to America (and especially those published prior to the\r\n18th century) the collations are printed so as to show what each line of\r\nthe original title embraces, _i. e._ with vertical marks or dashes\r\nbetween the matter of the respective lines. This careful description is\r\ninvaluable to the bibliographical student, frequently enabling him to\r\nidentify editions, or to solve doubts as to the genuineness of a\r\nbook-title in hand. The collation by number of pages is given in all\r\ncases where the book has been seen, or reported fully to the editor. The\r\norder of description as to each title is as follows: (1) Place of\r\npublication (2) publisher (3) year (4) collation and size of book. Notes\r\nin a smaller type frequently convey information of other editions, of\r\nprices in various sales, of minor works by the same writer, etc.\r\n\r\nThe fullness which has been aimed at in Sabin's American bibliography is\r\nseen in the great number of sermons and other specimens of pamphlet\r\nliterature which it chronicles. It gives also the titles of most early\r\nAmerican magazines, reviews, and other periodicals, except newspapers,\r\nwhich are generally omitted, as are maps also. As an example of the often\r\nminute cataloguing of the work, I may mention that no less than eight\r\npages are occupied with a list of the various publications and editions\r\nof books by Dr. Jedediah Morse, an author of whom few of the present\r\ngeneration of Americans have ever heard. He was the earliest American\r\ngeographer who published any comprehensive books upon the subject, and\r\nhis numerous Gazetteers and Geographies, published from 1784 to 1826,\r\nwere constantly reprinted, until supplanted by more full, if not more\r\naccurate works.\r\n\r\nUpon the whole, Sabin's great work, although so far from being finished,\r\nis invaluable as containing immeasurably more and fuller titles than any\r\nother American bibliography. It is also the only extensive work on the\r\nsubject which covers all periods, although the books of the last thirty\r\nyears must chiefly be excepted as not represented. As a work of\r\nreference, while its cost and scarcity may prevent the smaller public\r\nlibraries from possessing it, it is always accessible in the libraries of\r\nthe larger cities, where it is among the foremost works to be consulted\r\nin any research involving American publications, or books of any period\r\nor country relating to America, or its numerous sub-divisions.\r\n\r\nI may now mention, much more cursorily, some other bibliographies\r\npertaining to our country. The late Henry Stevens, who died in 1886,\r\ncompiled a \"Catalogue of the American Books in the Library of the British\r\nMuseum.\" This was printed by the Museum authorities in 1856, and fills\r\n754 octavo pages. Its editor was a highly accomplished bibliographer and\r\nbook-merchant, born in Vermont, but during the last forty years of his\r\nlife resided in London, where he devoted himself to his profession with\r\ngreat learning and assiduity. He published many catalogues of various\r\nstocks of books collected by him, under such titles as \"Bibliotheca\r\nhistorica,\" \"Bibliotheca Americana,\" etc., in which the books were\r\ncarefully described, often with notes illustrating their history or their\r\nvalue. He became an authority upon rare books and early editions, and\r\nmade a valuable catalogue of the Bibles in the Caxton exhibition at\r\nLondon, in 1877, with bibliographical commentary. He was for years chief\r\npurveyor of the British Museum Library for its American book purchases,\r\nand aided the late James Lenox in building up that rich collection of\r\nAmericana and editions of the Scriptures which is now a part of the New\r\nYork Public Library. His catalogue of the American books in the British\r\nMuseum, though now over forty years old, and supplanted by the full\r\nalphabetical catalogue of that entire library since published, is a\r\nvaluable contribution to American bibliography.\r\n\r\nMr. Stevens was one of the most acute and learned bibliographers I have\r\nknown. He was a man of marked individuality and independent views; with a\r\nspice of eccentricity and humor, which crept into all his catalogues, and\r\nmade his notes highly entertaining reading. Besides his services to the\r\nBritish Museum Library, in building up its noble collection of Americana,\r\nand in whose rooms he labored for many years, with the aid of Panizzi and\r\nhis successors, whom he aided in return, Stevens collected multitudes of\r\nthe books which now form the choice treasures of the Lenox library, the\r\nCarter Brown library, at Providence, the Library of Congress, and many\r\nmore American collections. To go with him through any lot of Americana,\r\nin one of his enterprising visits to New York, where he sometimes came to\r\nmarket his overflowing stores picked up in London and on the continent,\r\nwas a rare treat. Every book, almost, brought out some verbal criticism,\r\nanecdote or reminiscence of his book-hunting experiences, which began in\r\nAmerica, and extended all over Europe.\r\n\r\nHe was not only an indefatigable collector, but a most industrious and\r\naccurate bibliographer, doing more work in that field, probably, than any\r\nother American. He wrote a singularly careful, though rapid hand, as\r\nplain and condensed as print, and in days before modern devices for\r\nmanifolding writing were known, he copied out his invoices in duplicate\r\nor triplicate in his own hand, with titles in full, and frequent\r\ndescriptive notes attached. His many catalogues are notable for the\r\nvaried learning embodied. He was a most intelligent and vigilant book\r\ncollector for more than forty years, his early labors embracing towns in\r\nNew York and New England, as purveyor for material for Peter Force, of\r\nWashington, whose American Archives were then in course of preparation.\r\nAmong the library collectors who absorbed large portions of his gathered\r\ntreasures, were James Lenox, Jared Sparks, George Livermore, John Carter\r\nBrown, Henry C. Murphy, George Brinley, the American Geographical\r\nSociety, and many historical societies. He was an authority on all the\r\nearly voyages, and wrote much upon them. No one knew more about early\r\nBibles than Henry Stevens.\r\n\r\nHis enterprise and ambition for success led him to bold and sometimes\r\nextensive purchases. He bought about 1865, the library of Baron von\r\nHumboldt, and this and other large ventures embarrassed him much in later\r\nyears. He became the owner of the Franklin manuscripts, left in London by\r\nthe great man's grandson, and collected during many years a library of\r\nFrankliniana, which came to the Library of Congress when the Franklin\r\nmanuscripts were purchased for the State Department in 1881.\r\n\r\nHe was proud of his country and his State, always signing himself \"Henry\r\nStevens, of Vermont.\" His book-plate had engraved beneath his name, the\r\ntitles, \"G. M. B.: F. S. A.\" The last, of course, designated him as\r\nFellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London, but the first puzzled\r\neven his friends, until it was interpreted as signifying \"Green Mountain\r\nBoy.\" His brother used jocosely to assure me that it really meant\r\n\"Grubber of Musty Books.\"\r\n\r\nAs to his prices for books, while some collectors complained of them as\r\n\"very stiff,\" they appear, when compared with recent sales of Americana,\r\nat auction and in sale catalogues, to be quite moderate. The late\r\nhistorian Motley told me that Mr. Stevens charged more than any one for\r\nDutch books relating to America; but Mr. Motley's measure of values was\r\ngauged by the low prices of Dutch booksellers which prevailed during his\r\nresidence in the Netherlands, for years before the keen demand from\r\nAmerica had rendered the numerous Dutch tracts of the West India Company,\r\netc., more scarce and of greater commercial value than they bore at the\r\nmiddle of this century.\r\n\r\nAs treating of books by American authors, though not so much a complete\r\nbibliography of their works, as a critical history, with specimens\r\nselected from each writer, Duyckinck's \"Cyclopaedia of American\r\nLiterature\" deserves special mention. The last edition appeared at\r\nPhiladelphia, in 1875, in two large quarto volumes. Equally worthy of\r\nnote is the compilation by E. C. Stedman and Ellen M. Hutchinson, in\r\neleven volumes, entitled \"Library of American Literature,\" New York,\r\n1887-90. A most convenient hand-book of bibliographical reference is\r\nOscar F. Adams's \"Dictionary of American Authors,\" Boston, 1897, which\r\ngives in a compact duodecimo volume, the name and period of nearly every\r\nAmerican writer, with a brief list of his principal works, and their date\r\nof publication, in one alphabet.\r\n\r\nOf notable catalogues of books relating to America, rather than of\r\nAmerican publications, should be named White Kennet's \"Bibliotheca\r\nAmericana primordia,\" the earliest known catalogue devoted to American\r\nbibliography, London, 1713; O. Rich, Catalogue of Books relating to\r\nAmerica, 1500-1700, London, 1832; Rich, \"Bibliotheca Americana nova,\"\r\nbooks printed between 1700 and 1844, two volumes, London, 1835-46; H.\r\nHarrisse, \"Bibliotheca Americana vetustissima,\" New York, 1866, and its\r\nsupplement, Paris, 1872, both embracing rare early Americana, published\r\nfrom 1492 to 1551. This is a critically edited bibliography of the rarest\r\nbooks concerning America that appeared in the first half century after\r\nits discovery.\r\n\r\nThe important field of American local history has given birth to many\r\nbibliographies. The earliest to be noted is H. E. Ludewig's \"Literature\r\nof American Local History,\" New York, 1846. Thirty years later came F. B.\r\nPerkins's \"Check List for American Local History,\" Boston, 1876; followed\r\nby A. P. C. Griffin's \"Index of articles upon American Local History in\r\nhistorical collections,\" Boston, 1889, and by his \"Index of the\r\nliterature of American local history in collections published in\r\n1890-95,\" Boston, 1896. Closely allied to the catalogues of city, town,\r\nand county histories, come the bibliographies of genealogies and family\r\nhistories, of which the last or 4th edition of D. S. Durrie's\r\n\"Bibliographia genealogica Americana; an alphabetical index to American\r\ngenealogies in county and town histories, printed genealogies, and\r\nkindred works,\" Albany, 1895, is the most comprehensive and\r\nindispensable. This work gives us an alphabet of family names, under each\r\nof which are grouped the titles of books in which that special name is\r\ntreated, with citation of the page. It also gives the name and date of\r\npublication of the special family genealogies which are separately\r\nprinted, whether book or pamphlet, with number of pages in each. The\r\nwork is by a librarian, to whose laborious diligence Americans are deeply\r\nindebted.\r\n\r\nAmong other bibliographies of genealogy are Munsell's \"American\r\nGenealogist: a catalogue of family histories,\" Albany, 1897. This work\r\naims to give the titles of all separately printed American genealogies,\r\nin an alphabet of family names, giving titles in full, with place and\r\nyear of publication, name of publisher, and collation, or number of\r\npages.\r\n\r\nFor the multitudinous public documents of the United States, consult B.\r\nP. Poore's \"Descriptive catalogue of the government publications of the\r\nUnited States, 1775-1881,\" Washington, 1885, and F. A. Crandall, Check\r\nlist of public documents, debates and proceedings from 1st to 53d\r\nCongress (1789-1895), Washington, 1895; also,\r\n\r\nComprehensive index to the publications of the United States government,\r\n1889-1893. The same--United States Catalogue of Public Documents, 1893 to\r\n1895, Washington, 1896. Several biennial or annual lists of United States\r\nDocuments have followed.\r\n\r\nAs supplementing these extensive catalogues, we have in the Appendix to\r\nthe \"American Catalogue\" of 1885 a List of United States Government\r\npublications from 1880 to 1884; in that of 1891 a List from 1884 to 1890;\r\nand in that of 1896 a List covering the years 1891 to 1895.\r\n\r\nA most important recent bibliography is found in H. C. Bolton's\r\n\"Catalogue of Scientific and Technical Periodicals, 1665-1895,\"\r\nWashington, 1897.\r\n\r\nThere are also many sale catalogues of American books, with prices, some\r\nof which may be noted, _e. g._ J. R. Smith, Bibliotheca Americana,\r\nLondon, 1865; F. Müller, Catalogue of books and pamphlets relating to\r\nAmerica, Amsterdam, 1877, and later years.

Clarke & Co., \"Bibliotheca Americana,\"\r\nCincinnati, 1874, 1878, 1887, 1891, and 1893.\r\n\r\nThere are, besides, important catalogues of some private libraries,\r\ndevoted wholly or chiefly to books relating to America. Among these, the\r\nmost extensive and costly is John R. Bartlett's catalogue of the library\r\nof J. Carter Brown, of Providence, in four sumptuous volumes, with\r\nfac-similes of early title-pages, of which bibliography only fifty copies\r\nwere printed. It is entitled, \"Bibliotheca Americana: a catalogue of\r\nbooks relating to North and South America,\" 1482-1800, 4 vols. large\r\n8vo., Providence, 1870-82. The Carter Brown Library is now the richest\r\ncollection of Americana in any private library in the world.\r\n\r\nAmong catalogues of libraries sold by auction, and composed largely of\r\nAmerican books, are those of John A. Rice, New York, 1870: W. Menzies,\r\nNew York, 1875: George Brinley, in five volumes, sold 1878 to 1886: Henry\r\nC. Murphy, New York, 1884: S. L. M. Barlow, New York, 1889: and Brayton\r\nIves, New York, 1891.\r\n\r\nThe wide field of bibliography of English literature has given birth to\r\nmany books. Only the more comprehensive can here be noted.\r\n\r\nR. Watt's Bibliotheca Britannica, in four quarto volumes, Edinburgh,\r\n1824, although now old, is still an indispensable work of reference,\r\ngiving multitudes of titles of English books and pamphlets not found in\r\nany other bibliography. It of course abounds in errors, most of which\r\nhave been copied in Allibone's Dictionary of English literature. This\r\nextensive work is a monument of labor, to which the industrious compiler\r\ndevoted many years, dying of too intense study, at Glasgow, at the early\r\nage of forty-five, in the year 1819. The issue of the work in 1824, being\r\nthus posthumous, its errors and omissions are largely accounted for by\r\nthe author's inability to correct the press. The plan of the work is\r\nunique. Vols. 1 and 2 contain the alphabet of authors and titles, with\r\ndates and publishers' prices when known. Vols. 3 and 4 contain an\r\nalphabet of subjects, in which the titles re-appear, with a key alphabet\r\nin italic letters attached to each title, by which reference is made to\r\nthe author-catalogue, at a fixed place, where all the works of the author\r\nare recorded.\r\n\r\nThe work is printed in small type, with two crowded columns on a page,\r\nthus containing an enormous amount of matter. The key is quickly learned,\r\nand by its aid, and the alphabet of subjects, the librarian can find out\r\nthe authors of many anonymous books. Watt is the only general\r\nbibliography of English literature which gives most of the obscure\r\nwriters and their works.\r\n\r\nLowndes' Bibliographer's Manual of English Literature, in its second\r\nedition, enlarged by H. G. Bohn, is a most indispensable bibliography.\r\nThis work is arranged alphabetically by authors' names, and aims to\r\nrecord all important books published in Great Britain, from the earliest\r\ntimes to about A. D. 1834. It is in eleven parts, or 6 vols. 16 mo. of\r\nvery portable size, Lond., 1857-65. While it gives collations of the more\r\nimportant works, with publishers and dates, it fails to record many\r\neditions of the same work. Its quoted prices represent the original\r\npublisher's price, with very frequent additions of the sale prices\r\nobtained at book auctions. The chief defect of Lowndes' Manual is its\r\ntotal lack of any index of subjects.\r\n\r\nS. Austin Allibone's \"Critical Dictionary of English literature,\"\r\nPhiladelphia, 1858-71, 3 volumes, with supplement by John F. Kirk, in 2\r\nvols., Philadelphia, 1891, is a copious reference book, which, in spite\r\nof its many errors and crudities, should be in all libraries. It contains\r\nin abbreviated form most of the titles in Watt and Lowndes, with the\r\naddition of American authors, and of British books published since the\r\nperiod covered by Lowndes. The three volumes of Allibone accompany the\r\ntitles of works by noted authors with many critical remarks, copied\r\nmostly from reviews and literary journals. This feature of the book,\r\nwhich makes it rather a work of literary history and criticism than a\r\nbibliography pure and simple, has been dropped in Mr. Kirk's supplement,\r\nwhich thus becomes properly a bibliography. The publications of England\r\nand America, from about 1850 to 1890, are more fully chronicled in this\r\nwork of Kirk than in any other bibliography.\r\n\r\nThe important \"English Catalogue of Books,\" from A. D. 1835 to 1897, in 5\r\nvols., with its valuable Index of Subjects, in 4 vols., from 1857 up to\r\n1889, is so constantly useful as to be almost indispensable in a public\r\nlibrary. It records, in provokingly brief one-line titles, with\r\npublisher's name, year of issue, and price, all books published in Great\r\nBritain whose titles could be secured. It thus subserves the same purpose\r\nfor English publications, which the American Catalogue fulfills for those\r\nof the United States. Both are in effect greatly condensed\r\nbibliographies, enabling the librarian to locate most of the published\r\nliterature in the English language for many years back. The English\r\ncatalogue, from 1897 to date, is supplemented by its annual issues,\r\nentitled \"the English Catalogue of Books for 1898,\" etc.\r\n\r\nI have said that accuracy should be one of the cardinal aims of the\r\nlibrarian: and this because in that profession it is peculiarly\r\nimportant. Bibliography is a study which approaches very nearly to the\r\nrank of an exact science; and the practice of it, in application to the\r\ndaily work of the librarian, is at once a school of accuracy, and a test\r\nof ability. A habit of analytical methods should be assiduously\r\ncultivated, without which much time will be lost in fruitless searches in\r\nthe wrong books to find what one wants. As a single illustration of this\r\nneed of method, suppose that you want to find the title of a certain book\r\nwith its full description, a want likely to occur every hour in the day,\r\nand sometimes many times an hour. The book is perhaps Sir Walter Scott's\r\nLife of Napoleon,--9 vols., London, 1827, and your object is to trace its\r\ntitle, published price, etc., among the numerous bibliographies of\r\nliterature. You begin by a simple act of analysis--thus. This is a\r\nLondon, not an American book--hence it is useless to look in any American\r\ncatalogue. It is written in English, so you are dispensed from looking\r\nfor it in any French or other foreign bibliography. Its date is 1827,\r\nLondon. Therefore among the three leading English reference books in\r\nbibliography, which are Watt's Bibliotheca Britannica, Lowndes'\r\nBibliographer's Manual, and the English Catalogue, you at once eliminate\r\nthe former as not containing the book. Why do you do this? Because Watt's\r\ngreat work, in four huge quartos, though invaluable for the early English\r\nliterature, stops with books published before the date of its issue,\r\n1824. Your book is published in 1827, and of course could not appear in a\r\ncatalogue of 1824. Shall you refer then to the English Catalogue for its\r\ntitle? No, because the five volumes of that useful work (though some\r\nimperfect book lists were published earlier), begin with the year 1835,\r\nand the book you seek bears date of 1827. You are then reduced, by this\r\nsimple process of analyzing in your mind the various sources of\r\ninformation, and rejecting all except one, namely Lowndes'\r\nBibliographer's Manual, to a search in a single catalogue for your title.\r\nThis simplifies matters greatly, and saves all the time which might\r\notherwise have been lost in hunting fruitlessly through several works of\r\nreference. Lowndes' invaluable Manual was published in 1834, and though a\r\nsecond edition, edited by Bohn, appeared thirty years later, it does not\r\ncontain books published after that date, unless they are later editions\r\nof works issued earlier. You find in it your Scott's Napoleon, date 1827,\r\nwith its published price, £4. 14. 6, and an account of other later\r\neditions of the book. Of course you will observe that it is necessary to\r\nknow what period of years is covered by the various bibliographies, and\r\nto carry those dates perpetually in your memory, in order thus to\r\nsimplify searches, and save time. Once learned, you will have the comfort\r\nof knowing where to turn for light upon any book, and the faculty of\r\naccurate memory will reward the pains taken to acquire it.\r\n\r\nI must not omit to include, in noting the more useful and important\r\nEnglish bibliographies, the very copious list of works appended to each\r\nbiography of British writers, in the new \"Dictionary of National\r\nBiography,\" Lond., 1885-1900. This extensive work is nearly finished in\r\nabout 65 volumes, and constitutes a rich thesaurus of information about\r\nall British authors, except living ones.\r\n\r\nLiving characters, considered notable, and brief note of their books, are\r\nrecorded in \"Men and Women of the Time,\" 15th ed. London, 1899--but this\r\nbook, although highly useful, is far from being a bibliography.\r\n\r\nI should not omit to mention among useful librarians' aids, the \"Book\r\nPrices Current; record of prices at which books have been sold at\r\nauction.\" This London publication began with the year 1887. No sales are\r\nreported of books bringing less than one pound sterling. The book-sales\r\nof 1898 were reported in 1899 of this issue, and the book is published in\r\neach case the next year. The similar catalogue entitled \"American Book\r\nPrices Current\" was begun with 1895, being compiled from the sale\r\ncatalogues of American auctioneers, for that year, and the prices brought\r\nat auction in New York, Boston, Philadelphia, and Chicago, are recorded\r\nfor all notable books, but limited to works bringing as much as $3 or\r\nupward. Five years' reports, in as many volumes, have now been issued,\r\nand the publication is to be continued. Its utility of course consists in\r\ninforming librarians or collectors of the most recent auction values of\r\nbooks. At the same time, a word of caution is required, since it is not\r\nsafe to judge of average commercial values, from any isolated bid at an\r\nauction sale.\r\n\r\nA very useful classed catalogue, published by the British Museum library,\r\nand edited by G. K. Fortescue, an assistant librarian, is the so-called\r\n\"Subject-index to modern works,\" of which three volumes have appeared,\r\nbeginning with the accessions of 1880-85, each covering five years\r\nadditions of new works, in all European languages, to that library. The\r\nthird volume embraces the years 1890 to 1895, and appeared in 1896. As\r\nthis is not confined to works in English, it should be classed with\r\nuniversal bibliography. As containing most of the latest books of any\r\nnote, all three volumes are important aids to research. They are printed\r\nin large type, in which it is a refreshment to the eye to read titles,\r\nafter the small and obscure print of Watt's Bibliotheca Britannica, and\r\nthe but little better type of Lowndes' Manual, and of the English\r\nCatalogue. A collation of pages is also added in most cases, and the\r\nimportance of this can hardly be overrated. These catalogues of the\r\nBritish Museum Library abound in pamphlets, English, French, German,\r\nItalian, etc., evincing how large a share of attention is given to the\r\nminor literature coming from the press in the more recent years.\r\n\r\nW. H. D. Adams's \"Dictionary of English Literature,\" London, 1880, and\r\nlater, in a compact volume, gives authors and titles of the more\r\nimportant English and American books. Also, in the same alphabet, an\r\nindex to the titles, as well as authors, by the first word, and to many\r\nsayings or quotations, with their original sources. It is a highly useful\r\nbook, although its small bulk leaves it far from being a comprehensive\r\none.\r\n\r\nChambers' Cyclopaedia of English Literature, in 2 vols., London, 1876,\r\nhas an account of the most notable British writers, with specimens of\r\ntheir works, and forms what may be termed an essential part of the\r\nequipment of every public library.\r\n\r\nThe Library Association of the United Kingdom, since 1888, the date of\r\nits organization, has published Transactions and Proceedings; also, since\r\n1889, \"The Library,\" a periodical with bibliographical information.\r\n\r\nIt may be noted, without undue expression of pride, that America first\r\nset the example of an organized national association of Librarians\r\n(founded in 1876) followed the same year by a journal devoted to Library\r\ninterests. That extremely useful periodical, the _Library Journal_, is\r\nnow in its twenty-fourth volume. Its successive issues have contained\r\nlists of nearly all new bibliographical works and catalogues published,\r\nin whatever language.\r\n\r\nThe London Publisher's Circular, first established in 1838, is a weekly\r\norgan of the book-publishing trade, aiming to record the titles of all\r\nBritish publications as they appear from the press. It gives, in an\r\nalphabet by authors' names, the titles in much abbreviated form, with\r\npublisher, size in inches, collation, price, and date, with a fairly good\r\nindex of titles or subjects, in the same alphabet. Covering much the same\r\nground, as a publishers' periodical, is \"The Bookseller,\" issued monthly\r\nsince 1858, with lists of the new issues of the British press, and\r\ncritical notices. In addition to the English catalogue, there is the\r\nextensive Whitaker's \"Reference catalogue of current literature,\"\r\npublished every year, which now makes two large volumes, and embraces the\r\ntrade catalogues of English publishers, bound up in alphabetical order,\r\nwith a copious index, by authors and titles, in one alphabet, prefixed.\r\n\r\nWhile on English bibliographies, I must note the important work on local\r\nhistory, by J. P. Anderson, \"Book of British Topography,\" London, 1881.\r\nThis gives, in an alphabet of counties, titles of all county histories or\r\ndescriptive works of England, Scotland, Ireland, and Wales, followed in\r\neach county by a list of town histories or topographical works. The\r\narrangement under each town is chronological. Its only want is a\r\ncollation of the books. British genealogy, or the history of families, is\r\ntreated bibliographically in G. W. Marshall's \"The Genealogist's Guide,\"\r\nLondon, 1893, which gives an alphabet of family names, with references in\r\ngreat detail to county and town histories, pedigrees, heralds'\r\nvisitations, genealogies, etc., all over Great Britain, in which any\r\nfamily is treated.\r\n\r\nThe wide field of foreign bibliography, by countries, cannot here be\r\nentered upon, nor can I now treat of the still more extensive range of\r\nworks devoted to the bibliography of various subjects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Access to shelves, 215-225\r\n    Accuracy, rarity of, 254-257\r\n    Adams (O.

Volume II.--1676-1765. Each $2.50.\r\nAgawam edition, 2 vols. in one. 8°, half leather, $3.00.\r\n\r\n\"In the execution of his work thus far, Professor Tyler has evinced a\r\nskill in the arrangement of his materials, and a masterly power of\r\ncombination, which will at once place it in a very eminent rank among\r\nAmerican historical compositions. It is not so much the history of a\r\nspecial development of literature, as a series of profound and brilliant\r\nstudies on the character and genius of a people of whom that literature\r\nwas the natural product. The work betrays acute philosophical insight, a\r\nrare power of historical research, and a cultivated literary habit, which\r\nwas perhaps no less essential than the two former conditions, to its\r\nsuccessful accomplishment. The style of the author is marked by vigor,\r\noriginality, comprehensiveness, and a curious instinct in the selection\r\nof words. In this latter respect, though not in the moulding of\r\nsentences, the reader may perhaps be reminded of the choice and fragrant\r\nvocabulary of Washington Irving, whose words alone often leave an\r\nexquisite odor like the perfume of sweet-brier and arbutus.\"--GEORGE\r\nRIPLEY, in _The Tribune_.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LITERARY HISTORY OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION\r\n\r\n1763-1783\r\n\r\nTwo volumes, large octavo. Sold separately.\r\nVolume I.--1763-1776. Volume II.--1776-1783. Each $3.00.\r\n\r\nThis work is the result of an altogether new and original treatment of\r\nthe American Revolution. The outward history of that period has been many\r\ntimes written, and is now, by a new school of American historians, being\r\nfreshly re-written in the light of larger evidence, and after a more\r\ndisinterested and judicial method. In the present work, for the first\r\ntime in a systematic and complete way, is set forth the inward history of\r\nour Revolution,--the history of its ideas, its spiritual moods, its\r\npassions, as these uttered themselves at the time in the writings of the\r\ntwo parties of Americans who either promoted or resisted that great\r\nmovement.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHREE MEN OF LETTERS\r\n\r\nChapters in Literary Biography and Criticism devoted to\r\nGeorge Berkeley, Timothy Dwight, and Joel Barlow.\r\n\r\n12°, gilt top, $1.25.\r\n\r\n\"Though more lengthy than most of the sketches in Professor Tyler's\r\nwell-known 'History,' these monographs have much of the brevity of their\r\noriginal purpose; and they are marked by the same picturesqueness of\r\ntreatment, the same vivacity of expression, and the same felicity of\r\nstatement, that characterize the author's larger volumes.\"--_The Nation._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nG.
