The more important of these changes are the following:--\r\n\r\nChapter VII. The account of the migrations of animals and plants during and\r\nsince the Glacial Epoch, has been modified to accord with newer\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\nChapters VIII and IX. The discussion of the causes of Glacial Epochs and\r\nMild Arctic Climates has been somewhat modified in view of the late Dr.\r\nCroll's remarks, and the argument rendered clearer.\r\n\r\nChapter XIII. Several additions to the Fauna of the Galapagos have been\r\nnoted.\r\n\r\nChapter XV. Considerable additions have been made to this chapter embodying\r\nthe recent discoveries of birds and insects new to the Sandwich Islands,\r\nwhile a much fuller account has been given of its highly peculiar and very\r\ninteresting flora.\r\n\r\nChapter XVI. Important additions and corrections have been made in the\r\nlists of peculiar British animals and plants embodying the most recent\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\nChapter XVII. Very large additions have been made to the mammalia and birds\r\nof Borneo, and full lists of the peculiar species are given. {viii}\r\n\r\nChapter XVIII. A more accurate account is given of the birds of Japan.\r\n\r\nChapter XIX. The recent additions to the mammals and birds of Madagascar\r\nare embodied in this chapter, and a fuller sketch is given of the rich and\r\npeculiar flora of the island.\r\n\r\nChapter XXI. and XXII. Some important additions have been made to these\r\nchapters owing to more accurate information as to the depth of the sea\r\naround New Zealand, and to the discovery of abundant remains of fossil\r\nplants of the tertiary and cretaceous periods both in New Zealand and\r\nAustralia.\r\n\r\nIn the body of the work I have in each case acknowledged the valuable\r\ninformation given me by naturalists of eminence in their various\r\ndepartments, and I return my best thanks to all who have so kindly assisted\r\nme. I am however indebted in a special manner to one gentleman--Mr. Theo.\r\nD. A. Cockerell, now Curator of the Museum of the Jamaica Institute--who\r\nsupplied me with a large amount of information by searching the most recent\r\nworks in the scientific libraries, by personal inquiries among naturalists,\r\nand also by giving me the benefit of his own copious notes and\r\nobservations. Without his assistance it would have been difficult for me to\r\nhave made the present edition so full and complete as I hope it now is. In\r\na work of such wide range, and dealing with so large a body of facts some\r\nerrors will doubtless be detected, though, I trust few of importance.\r\n\r\n  PARKSTONE, DORSET, _December, 1891_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{ix}\r\n\r\nPREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION\r\n\r\nThe present volume is the result of four years' additional thought and\r\nresearch on the lines laid down in my _Geographical Distribution of\r\nAnimals_, and may be considered as a popular supplement to and completion\r\nof that work.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, at the same time a complete work in itself: and, from the\r\nmode of treatment adopted, it will, I hope, be well calculated to bring\r\nbefore the intelligent reader the wide scope and varied interest of this\r\nbranch of natural history. Although some of the earlier chapters deal with\r\nthe same questions as my former volumes, they are here treated from a\r\ndifferent point of view; and as the discussion of them is more elementary\r\nand at the same time tolerably full, it is hoped that they will prove both\r\ninstructive and interesting. The plan of my larger work required that\r\n_genera_ only should be taken account of; in the present volume I often\r\ndiscuss the distribution of _species_, and this will help to render the\r\nwork more intelligible to the unscientific reader.\r\n\r\nThe full statement of the scope and object of the present essay given in\r\nthe \"Introductory\" chapter, together with the \"Summary\" of the whole work\r\nand the general view of the more important arguments given in the\r\n\"Conclusion,\" render it unnecessary for me to offer any further remarks on\r\nthese points. I may, however, state {x} generally that, so far as I am able\r\nto judge, a real advance has here been made in the mode of treating\r\nproblems in Geographical Distribution, owing to the firm establishment of a\r\nnumber of preliminary doctrines or \"principles,\" which in many cases lead\r\nto a far simpler and yet more complete solution of such problems than have\r\nbeen hitherto possible. The most important of these doctrines are those\r\nwhich establish and define--(1) The former wide extension of all groups now\r\ndiscontinuous, as being a necessary result of \"evolution\"; (2) The\r\npermanence of the great features of the distribution of land and water on\r\nthe earth's surface; and, (3) The nature and frequency of climatal changes\r\nthroughout geological time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have now only to thank the many friends and correspondents who have given\r\nme information or advice. Besides those whose assistance is acknowledged in\r\nthe body of the work, I am especially indebted to four gentlemen who have\r\nbeen kind enough to read over the proofs of chapters dealing with questions\r\non which they have special knowledge, giving me the benefit of valuable\r\nemendations and suggestions. Mr. Edward R. Alston has looked over those\r\nparts of the earlier chapters which relate to the mammals of Europe and the\r\nNorth Temperate zone; Mr. S. B. J. Skertchley, of the Geological Survey,\r\nhas read the chapters which discuss the glacial epoch and other geological\r\nquestions; Professor A. Newton has looked over the passages referring to\r\nthe birds of the Madagascar group; while Sir Joseph D. Hooker has given me\r\nthe invaluable benefit of his remarks on my two chapters dealing with the\r\nNew Zealand flora.\r\n\r\n  CROYDON, _August, 1880_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *

The sunny isles of the Mediterranean, the sands\r\nand date-palms of Egypt, the arid rocks of Aden, the cocoa groves of\r\nCeylon, the tiger-haunted jungles of Malacca and Singapore, the fertile\r\nplains and volcanic peaks of Luzon, the forest-clad mountains of Formosa,\r\nand the bare hills of China, pass successively in review; till after a\r\ncircuitous voyage of thirteen thousand miles he finds himself at Hakodadi\r\nin Japan. He is now separated from his starting-point by the whole width of\r\nEurope and Northern Asia, by an almost endless succession of plains and\r\nmountains, arid deserts or icy plateaux, yet when he visits the interior of\r\nthe country he sees so many familiar natural objects that he can hardly\r\nhelp fancying he is close to his home. He finds the woods and fields\r\ntenanted by tits, hedge-sparrows, wrens, wagtails, larks, redbreasts, {4}\r\nthrushes, buntings, and house-sparrows, some absolutely identical with our\r\nown feathered friends, others so closely resembling them that it requires a\r\npractised ornithologist to tell the difference. If he is fond of insects he\r\nnotices many butterflies and a host of beetles which, though on close\r\nexamination they are found to be distinct from ours, are yet of the same\r\ngeneral aspect, and seem just what might be expected in any part of Europe.\r\nThere are also of course many birds and insects which are quite new and\r\npeculiar, but these are by no means so numerous or conspicuous as to remove\r\nthe general impression of a wonderful resemblance between the productions\r\nof such remote islands as Britain and Yesso.\r\n\r\nNow let an inhabitant of Australia sail to New Zealand, a distance of less\r\nthan thirteen hundred miles, and he will find himself in a country whose\r\nproductions are totally unlike those of his own. Kangaroos and wombats\r\nthere are none, the birds are almost all entirely new, insects are very\r\nscarce and quite unlike the handsome or strange Australian forms, while\r\neven the vegetation is all changed, and no gum-tree, or wattle, or\r\ngrass-tree meets the traveller's eye.\r\n\r\nBut there are some more striking cases even than this, of the diversity of\r\nthe productions of countries not far apart. In the Malay Archipelago there\r\nare two islands, named Bali and Lombok, each about as large as Corsica, and\r\nseparated by a strait only fifteen miles wide at its narrowest part. Yet\r\nthese islands differ far more from each other in their birds and quadrupeds\r\nthan do England and Japan. The birds of the one are extremely _unlike_\r\nthose of the other, the difference being such as to strike even the most\r\nordinary observer. Bali has red and green woodpeckers, barbets,\r\nweaver-birds, and black-and-white magpie-robins, none of which are found in\r\nLombok, where, however, we find screaming cockatoos and friar-birds, and\r\nthe strange mound-building megapodes, which are all equally unknown in\r\nBali. Many of the kingfishers, crow-shrikes, and other birds, though of the\r\nsame general form, are of very distinct species; and though a considerable\r\nnumber of birds are the same in both islands the difference {5} is none the\r\nless remarkable--as proving that mere distance is one of the least\r\nimportant of the causes which have determined the likeness or unlikeness in\r\nthe animals of different countries.\r\n\r\nIn the western hemisphere we find equally striking examples. The Eastern\r\nUnited States possess very peculiar and interesting plants and animals, the\r\nvegetation becoming more luxuriant as we go south but not altering in\r\nessential character, so that when we reach Alabama or Florida we still find\r\nourselves in the midst of pines, oaks, sumachs, magnolias, vines, and other\r\ncharacteristic forms of the temperate flora; while the birds, insects, and\r\nland-shells are of the same general character with those found further\r\nnorth.[1] But if we now cross over the narrow strait, about fifty miles\r\nwide, which separates Florida from the Bahama Islands, we find ourselves in\r\na totally different country, surrounded by a vegetation which is\r\nessentially tropical and generally identical with that of Cuba. The change\r\nis most striking, because there is little difference of climate, of soil,\r\nor apparently of position, to account for it; and when we find that the\r\nbirds, the insects, and especially the land-shells of the Bahamas are\r\nalmost all West Indian, while the North American types of plants and\r\nanimals have almost all completely disappeared, we shall be convinced that\r\nsuch differences and resemblances cannot be due to existing conditions, but\r\nmust depend upon laws and causes to which mere proximity of position offers\r\nno clue.\r\n\r\nHardly less uncertain and irregular are the effects of climate. Hot\r\ncountries usually differ widely from cold ones in all their organic forms;\r\nbut the difference is by no means constant, nor does it bear any proportion\r\nto difference of temperature. Between frigid Canada and sub-tropical\r\nFlorida there are less marked differences in the animal productions than\r\nbetween Florida and Cuba or Yucatan, so much more alike in climate and so\r\nmuch nearer together. So the differences between the birds and quadrupeds\r\nof temperate Tasmania and tropical North {6} Australia are slight and\r\nunimportant as compared with the enormous differences we find when we pass\r\nfrom the latter country to equally tropical Java. If we compare\r\ncorresponding portions of different continents, we find no indication that\r\nthe almost perfect similarity of climate and general conditions has any\r\ntendency to produce similarity in the animal world. The equatorial parts of\r\nBrazil and of the West Coast of Africa are almost identical in climate and\r\nin luxuriance of vegetation, but their animal life is totally diverse. In\r\nthe former we have tapirs, sloths, and prehensile-tailed monkeys; in the\r\nlatter elephants, antelopes, and man-like apes; while among birds, the\r\ntoucans, chatterers, and humming-birds of Brazil are replaced by the\r\nplantain-eaters, bee-eaters, and sun-birds of Africa. Parts of\r\nSouth-temperate America, South Africa, and South Australia, correspond\r\nclosely in climate; yet the birds and quadrupeds of these three districts\r\nare as completely unlike each other as those of any parts of the world that\r\ncan be named.\r\n\r\nIf we visit the great islands of the globe, we find that they present\r\nsimilar anomalies in their animal productions, for while some exactly\r\nresemble the nearest continents others are widely different. Thus the\r\nquadrupeds, birds and insects of Borneo correspond very closely to those of\r\nthe Asiatic continent, while those of Madagascar are extremely unlike\r\nAfrican forms, although the distance from the continent is less in the\r\nlatter case than in the former. And if we compare the three great islands\r\nSumatra, Borneo, and Celebes--lying as it were side by side in the same\r\nocean--we find that the two former, although furthest apart, have almost\r\nidentical productions, while the two latter, though closer together, are\r\nmore unlike than Britain and Japan situated in different oceans and\r\nseparated by the largest of the great continents.\r\n\r\nThese examples will illustrate the kind of questions it is the object of\r\nthe present work to deal with. Every continent, every country, and every\r\nisland on the globe, offers similar problems of greater or less complexity\r\nand interest, and the time has now arrived when their solution can be\r\nattempted with some prospect of success. Many {7} years study of this class\r\nof subjects has convinced me that there is no short and easy method of\r\ndealing with them; because they are, in their very nature, the visible\r\noutcome and residual product of the whole past history of the earth. If we\r\ntake the organic productions of a small island, or of any very limited\r\ntract of country, such as a moderate-sized country parish, we have, in\r\ntheir relations and affinities--in the fact that they are _there_ and\r\nothers are _not_ there, a problem which involves all the migrations of\r\nthese species and their ancestral forms--all the vicissitudes of climate\r\nand all the changes of sea and land which have affected those\r\nmigrations--the whole series of actions and reactions which have determined\r\nthe preservation of some forms and the extinction of others,--in fact the\r\nwhole history of the earth, inorganic and organic, throughout a large\r\nportion of geological time.\r\n\r\nWe shall perhaps better exhibit the scope and complexity of the subject,\r\nand show that any intelligent study of it was almost impossible till quite\r\nrecently, if we concisely enumerate the great mass of facts and the number\r\nof scientific theories or principles which are necessary for its\r\nelucidation.\r\n\r\nWe require then in the first place an adequate knowledge of the fauna and\r\nflora of the whole world, and even a detailed knowledge of many parts of\r\nit, including the islands of more special interest and their adjacent\r\ncontinents. This kind of knowledge is of very slow growth, and is still\r\nvery imperfect;[2] and in many cases it can {8} never now be obtained owing\r\nto the reckless destruction of forests and with them of countless species\r\nof plants and animals. In the next place we require a true and natural\r\nclassification of animals and plants, so that we may know their real\r\naffinities; and it is only now that this is being generally arrived at. We\r\nfurther have to make use of the theory of \"descent with modification\" as\r\nthe only possible key to the interpretation of the facts of distribution,\r\nand this theory has only been generally accepted within the last twenty\r\nyears. It is evident that, so long as the belief in \"special creations\" of\r\neach species prevailed, no explanation of the complex facts of distribution\r\n_could_ be arrived at or even conceived; for if each species was created\r\nwhere it is now found no further inquiry can take us beyond that fact, and\r\nthere is an end of the whole matter. Another important factor in our\r\ninterpretation of the phenomena of distribution, is a knowledge of the\r\nextinct forms that have inhabited each country during the tertiary and\r\nsecondary periods of geology. New facts of this kind are daily coming to\r\nlight, but except as regards Europe, North America, and parts of India,\r\nthey are extremely scanty; and even in the best-known countries the record\r\nitself is often very defective and fragmentary. Yet we have already\r\nobtained remarkable evidence of the migrations of many animals and plants\r\nin past ages, throwing an often unexpected light on the actual distribution\r\nof many groups.[3] By this means alone can we obtain positive evidence of\r\nthe past migrations of organisms; and when, as too frequently is the case,\r\nthis is altogether wanting, we {9} have to trust to collateral evidence and\r\nmore or less probable hypothetical explanations. Hardly less valuable is\r\nthe evidence of stratigraphical geology; for this often shows us what parts\r\nof a country have been submerged at certain epochs, and thus enables us to\r\nprove that certain areas have been long isolated and the fauna and flora\r\nallowed time for special development. Here, too, our knowledge is\r\nexceedingly imperfect, though the blanks upon the geological map of the\r\nworld are yearly diminishing in extent. Lastly, as a most valuable\r\nsupplement to geology, we require to know approximately, the depth and\r\ncontour of the ocean-bed, since this affords an important clue to the\r\nformer existence of now-submerged lands, uniting islands to continents, or\r\naffording intermediate stations which have aided the migrations of many\r\norganisms. This kind of information has only been partially obtained during\r\nthe last few years; and it will be seen in the latter part of this volume,\r\nthat some of the most recent deep-sea soundings have afforded a basis for\r\nan explanation of one of the most difficult and interesting questions in\r\ngeographical biology--the origin of the fauna and flora of New Zealand.\r\n\r\nSuch are the various classes of evidence that bear directly on the question\r\nof the distribution of organisms; but there are others of even a more\r\nfundamental character, and the importance of which is only now beginning to\r\nbe recognised by students of nature. These are, firstly, the wonderful\r\nalterations of climate which have occurred in the temperate and polar\r\nzones, as proved by the evidences of glaciation in the one and of luxuriant\r\nvegetation in the other; and, secondly, the theory of the permanence of\r\nexisting continents and oceans. If glacial epochs in temperate lands and\r\nmild climates near the poles have, as now believed by men of eminence,\r\noccurred several times over in the past history of the earth, the effects\r\nof such great and repeated changes, both on the migration, modification,\r\nand extinction, of species, must have been of overwhelming importance--of\r\nmore importance perhaps than even the geological changes of sea and land.\r\nIt is therefore necessary to consider the evidence for these climatal\r\nchanges; {10} and then, by a critical examination of their possible causes,\r\nto ascertain whether they were isolated phenomena, were due to recurrent\r\ncosmical actions, or were the result of a great system of terrestrial\r\ndevelopment. The latter is the conclusion we arrive at; and this conclusion\r\nbrings with it the conviction, that in the theory which accounts for both\r\nglacial epochs and warm polar climates, we have the key to explain and\r\nharmonize many of the most anomalous biological and geological phenomena,\r\nand one which is especially valuable for the light it throws on the\r\ndispersal and existing distribution of organisms. The other important\r\ntheory, or rather corollary from the preceding theory--that of the\r\npermanence of oceans and the general stability of continents throughout all\r\ngeological time, is as yet very imperfectly understood, and seems, in fact,\r\nto many persons in the nature of a paradox. The evidence for it, however,\r\nappears to me to be conclusive; and it is certainly the most fundamental\r\nquestion in regard to the subject we have to deal with: since, if we once\r\nadmit that continents and oceans may have changed places over and over\r\nagain (as many writers maintain), we lose all power of reasoning on the\r\nmigrations of ancestral forms of life, and are at the mercy of every wild\r\ntheorist who chooses to imagine the former existence of a now-submerged\r\ncontinent to explain the existing distribution of a group of frogs or a\r\ngenus of beetles.\r\n\r\nAs already shown by the illustrative examples adduced in this chapter, some\r\nof the most remarkable and interesting facts in the distribution and\r\naffinities of organic forms are presented by islands in relation to each\r\nother and to the surrounding continents. The study of the productions of\r\nthe Galapagos--so peculiar, and yet so decidedly related to the American\r\ncontinent--appears to have had a powerful influence in determining the\r\ndirection of Mr. Darwin's researches into the origin of species; and every\r\nnaturalist who studies them has always been struck by the unexpected\r\nrelations or singular anomalies which are so often found to characterize\r\nthe fauna and flora of islands. Yet their full importance in connection\r\nwith the history of the earth and its inhabitants has hardly yet {11} been\r\nrecognised; and it is in order to direct the attention of naturalists to\r\nthis most promising field of research, that I restrict myself in this\r\nvolume to an elucidation of some of the problems they present to us. By far\r\nthe larger part of the islands of the globe are but portions of continents\r\nundergoing some of the various changes to which they are ever subject; and\r\nthe correlative proposition, that every portion of our continents has again\r\nand again passed through insular conditions, has not been sufficiently\r\nconsidered, but is, I believe, the statement of a great and most suggestive\r\ntruth, and one which lies at the foundation of all accurate conception of\r\nthe physical and organic changes which have resulted in the present state\r\nof the earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe indications now given of the scope and purpose of the present volume\r\nrenders it evident that, before we can proceed to the discussion of the\r\nremarkable phenomena presented by insular faunas and floras, and the\r\ncomplex causes which have produced them, we must go through a series of\r\npreliminary studies, adapted to give us a command of the more important\r\nfacts and principles on which the solution of such problems depends. The\r\nsucceeding eight chapters will therefore be devoted to the explanation of\r\nthe mode of distribution, variation, modification, and dispersal, of\r\nspecies and groups, illustrated by facts and examples; of the true nature\r\nof geological change as affecting continents and islands; of changes of\r\nclimate, their nature, causes, and effects; of the duration of geological\r\ntime and the rate of organic development.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{12}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE ELEMENTARY FACTS OF DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\n    Importance of Locality as an essential character of Species--Areas of\r\n    Distribution--Extent and Limitations of Specific Areas--Specific range\r\n    of Birds--Generic Areas--Separate and overlapping areas--The species of\r\n    Tits as illustrating Areas of Distribution--The distribution of the\r\n    species of Jays--Discontinuous generic areas--Peculiarities of generic\r\n    and family distribution--General features of overlapping and\r\n    discontinuous areas--Restricted areas of Families--The distribution of\r\n    Orders.\r\n\r\nSo long as it was believed that the several species of animals and plants\r\nwere \"special creations,\" and had been formed expressly to inhabit the\r\ncountries in which they are now found, their habitat was an ultimate fact\r\nwhich required no explanation. It was assumed that every animal was\r\n_exactly_ adapted to the climate and surroundings amid which it lived, and\r\nthat the only, or, at all events, the chief reason why it did not inhabit\r\nanother country was, that the climate or general conditions of that country\r\nwere not suitable to it, but in what the unsuitability consisted we could\r\nrarely hope to discover. Hence the exact locality of any species was not\r\nthought of much importance from a scientific point of view, and the idea\r\nthat anything could be learnt by a comparative study of different floras\r\nand faunas never entered the minds of the older naturalists.\r\n\r\nBut so soon as the theory of evolution came to be generally adopted, and it\r\nwas seen that each animal could only have come into existence in some area\r\nwhere ancestral {13} forms closely allied to it already lived, a real and\r\nimportant relation was established between an animal and its native\r\ncountry, and a new set of problems at once sprang into existence. From the\r\nold point of view the _diversities_ of animal life in the separate\r\ncontinents, even where physical conditions were almost identical, was the\r\nfact that excited astonishment; but seen by the light of the evolution\r\ntheory, it is the _resemblances_ rather than the diversities in these\r\ndistant continents and islands that are most difficult to explain. It thus\r\ncomes to be admitted that a knowledge of the exact area occupied by a\r\nspecies or a group is a real portion of its natural history, of as much\r\nimportance as its habits, its structure, or its affinities; and that we can\r\nnever arrive at any trustworthy conclusions as to how the present state of\r\nthe organic world was brought about, until we have ascertained with some\r\naccuracy the general laws of the distribution of living things over the\r\nearth's surface.\r\n\r\n_Areas of Distribution._--Every species of animal has a certain area of\r\ndistribution to which, as a rule, it is permanently confined, although, no\r\ndoubt, the limits of its range fluctuate somewhat from year to year, and in\r\nsome exceptional cases may be considerably altered in a few years or\r\ncenturies. Each species is moreover usually limited to one continuous area,\r\nover the whole of which it is more or less frequently to be met with, but\r\nthere are many apparent and some real exceptions to this rule. Some animals\r\nare so adapted to certain kinds of country--as to forests or marshes,\r\nmountains or deserts--that they cannot, permanently, live elsewhere. These\r\nmay be found scattered over a wide area in suitable spots only, but can\r\nhardly on that account be said to have several distinct areas of\r\ndistribution. As an example we may name the chamois, which lives only on\r\nhigh mountains, but is found in the Pyrenees, the Alps, the Carpathians, in\r\nsome of the Greek mountains and the Caucasus. The variable hare is another\r\nand more remarkable case, being found all over Northern Europe and Asia\r\nbeyond lat. 55deg, and also in Scotland and Ireland. In central Europe it\r\nis unknown till we come to the Alps, the Pyrenees, and the Caucasus, where\r\nit again appears. This is one of the best cases known of the {14}\r\ndiscontinuous distribution of a _species_, there being a gap of about a\r\nthousand miles between its southern limits in Russia, and its reappearance\r\nin the Alps. There are of course numerous instances in which species occur\r\nin two or more islands, or in an island and continent, and are thus\r\nrendered discontinuous by the sea, but these involve questions of changes\r\nin sea and land which we shall have to consider further on. Other cases are\r\nbelieved to exist of still wider separation of a species, as with the marsh\r\ntitmice and the reed buntings of Europe and Japan, where similar forms are\r\nfound in the extreme localities, while distinct varieties or sub-species,\r\ninhabit the intervening districts.\r\n\r\n_Extent and Limitations of Specific Areas._--Leaving for the present these\r\ncases of want of continuity in a species, we find the most wide difference\r\nbetween the extent of country occupied, varying in fact from a few square\r\nmiles to almost the entire land surface of the globe. Among the mammalia,\r\nhowever, the same species seldom inhabits both the old and new worlds,\r\nunless they are strictly arctic animals, as the reindeer, the elk, the\r\narctic fox, the glutton, the ermine, and some others. The common wolf of\r\nEurope and Northern Asia is thought by many naturalists to be identical\r\nwith the variously coloured wolves of North America extending from the\r\nArctic Ocean to Mexico, in which case this will have perhaps the widest\r\nrange of any species of mammal. Little doubt exists as to the identity of\r\nthe brown bears and the beavers of Europe and North America; but all these\r\nspecies range up to the arctic circle, and there is no example of a mammal\r\nuniversally admitted to be identical yet confined to the temperate zones of\r\nthe two hemispheres. Among the undisputed species of mammalia the leopard\r\nhas an enormous range, extending all over Africa and South Asia to Borneo\r\nand the east of China, and thus having probably the widest range of any\r\nknown mammal. The winged mammalia have not usually very wide ranges, there\r\nbeing only one bat common to the Old and New Worlds. This is a British\r\nspecies, _Vesperugo serotinus_, which is found over the larger part of\r\nNorth America, Europe and Asia, as far {15} as Pekin, and even extends into\r\ntropical Africa, thus rivalling the leopard and the wolf in the extent of\r\ncountry it occupies.\r\n\r\nOf very restricted ranges there are many examples, but some of these are\r\nsubject to doubts as to the distinctness of the species or as to its\r\ngeographical limits being really known. In Europe we have a distinct\r\nspecies of ibex (_Capra Pyrenaica_) confined to the Pyrenean mountains,\r\nwhile the true marmot is restricted to the Alpine range. More remarkable is\r\nthe Pyrenean water-mole (_Mygale Pyrenaica_), a curious small insectivorous\r\nanimal found only in a few places in the northern valleys of the Pyrenees.\r\nIn islands there are many cases of undoubted restriction of species to a\r\nsmall area, but these involve a different question from the range of\r\nspecies on continents where there is no _apparent_ obstacle to their wider\r\nextension.\r\n\r\n_Specific range of Birds._--Among birds we find instances of much wider\r\nrange of species, which is only what might be expected considering their\r\npowers of flight; but, what is very curious, we also find more striking\r\n(though perhaps not more frequent) examples of extreme limitation of range\r\namong birds than among mammals. Of the former phenomenon perhaps the most\r\nremarkable case is that afforded by the osprey or fishing-hawk, which\r\nranges over the greater portion of all the continents, as far as Brazil,\r\nSouth Africa, the Malay Islands, and Tasmania. The barn owl (_Strix\r\nflammea_) has nearly as wide a range, but in this case there is more\r\ndiversity of opinion as to the specific difference of many of the forms\r\ninhabiting remote countries, some of which seem undoubtedly to be distinct.\r\nAmong passerine birds the raven has probably the widest range, extending\r\nfrom the arctic regions to Texas and New Mexico in America, and to North\r\nIndia and Lake Baikal in Asia; while the little northern willow-wren\r\n(_Phylloscopus borealis_) ranges from arctic Norway across Asia to Alaska,\r\nand southward to Ceylon, China, Borneo, and Timor.\r\n\r\nOf very restricted continental ranges the best examples in Europe are, the\r\nlittle blue magpie (_Cyanopica cooki_) confined to the central portions of\r\nthe Spanish peninsula; and the Italian sparrow found only in Italy and\r\nCorsica. {16} In Asia, Palestine affords some examples of birds of very\r\nrestricted range--a beautiful sun-bird (_Nectarinea osea_) a peculiar\r\nstarling (_Amydrus tristramii_) and some others, being almost or quite\r\nconfined to the warmer portions of the valley of the Jordan. In the\r\nHimalayas there are numbers of birds which have very restricted ranges, but\r\nthose of the Neilgherries are perhaps better known, several species of\r\nlaughing thrushes and some other birds being found only on the summits of\r\nthese mountains. The most wonderfully restricted ranges are, however, to be\r\nfound among the humming-birds of tropical America. The great volcanic peaks\r\nof Chimborazo and Pichincha have each a peculiar species of humming-bird\r\nconfined to a belt just below the limits of perpetual snow, while the\r\nextinct volcano of Chiriqui in Veragua has a species confined to its wooded\r\ncrater. One of the most strange and beautiful of the humming-birds\r\n(_Loddigesia mirabilis_) was obtained once only, more than forty years ago,\r\nnear Chachapoyas in the Andes of northern Peru; and though Mr. Gould sent\r\nmany drawings of the bird to people visiting the district and for many\r\nyears offered a high reward for a specimen, no other has ever been seen![4]\r\n\r\nThe above details will sufficiently explain what is meant by the \"specific\r\narea\" or range of a species. The very wide and very narrow ranges are\r\nexceptional, the great majority of species both of mammals and birds\r\nranging over moderately wide areas, which present no striking contrasts in\r\nclimate and physical conditions. Thus a large proportion of European birds\r\nrange over the whole continent in an east and west direction, but\r\nconsiderable numbers are restricted either to the northern or the southern\r\nhalf. In Africa some species range over all the continent south of the\r\ndesert, while large numbers are restricted to the equatorial forests, or to\r\nthe upland plains. In North America, if we exclude the tropical and the\r\narctic portions, a considerable number of species range over all the\r\ntemperate parts of the continent, while still {17} more are restricted to\r\nthe east, the centre, or the west, respectively.\r\n\r\n_Generic Areas._--Having thus obtained a tolerably clear idea of the main\r\nfacts as to the distribution of isolated species, let us now consider those\r\ncollections of closely-allied species termed genera. What a genus is will\r\nbe sufficiently understood by a few illustrations. All the different kinds\r\nof dogs, jackals, and wolves belong to the dog genus, Canis; the tiger,\r\nlion, leopard, jaguar, and the wild cats, to the cat genus, Felis; the\r\nblackbird, song-thrush, missel-thrush, fieldfare, and many others to the\r\nthrush genus, Turdus; the crow, rook, raven, and jackdaw, to the crow\r\ngenus, Corvus; but the magpie belongs to another, though closely-allied\r\ngenus, Pica, distinguished by the different form and proportions of its\r\nwings and tail from all the species of the crow genus. The number of\r\nspecies in a genus varies greatly, from one up to several hundreds. The\r\ngiraffe, the glutton, the walrus, the bearded reedling, the secretary-bird,\r\nand many others, have no close allies, and each forms a genus by itself.\r\nThe beaver genus, Castor, and the camel genus, Camelus, each consist of two\r\nspecies. On the other hand, the deer genus, Cervus has forty species; the\r\nmouse and rat genus, Mus more than a hundred species; and there is about\r\nthe same number of the thrush genus; while among the lower classes of\r\nanimals genera are often very extensive, the fine genus Papilio, or\r\nswallow-tailed butterflies, containing more than four hundred species; and\r\nCicindela, which includes our native tiger beetles, has about the same\r\nnumber. Many genera of shells are very extensive, and one of them--the\r\ngenus Helix, including the commonest snails, and ranging all over the\r\nworld--is probably the most extensive in the animal kingdom, numbering\r\nabout two thousand described species.[5]\r\n\r\n_Separate and Overlapping Areas._--The species of a genus are distributed\r\nin two ways. Either they occupy distinct areas which do not touch each\r\nother and are sometimes widely separated, or they touch and occasionally\r\noverlap {18} each other, each species occupying an area of its own which\r\nrarely coincides exactly with that of any other species of the same genus.\r\nIn some cases, when a river, a mountain-chain, or a change of conditions as\r\nfrom pasture to desert or forest, determines the range of species, the\r\nareas of two species of the same genus may just meet, one beginning where\r\nthe other ends; but this is comparatively rare. It occurs, however, in the\r\nAmazon valley, where several species of monkeys, birds, and insects come up\r\nto the south bank of the river but do not pass it, while allied species\r\ncome to the north bank, which in like manner forms their boundary. As\r\nexamples we may mention that one of the Saki monkeys (_Pithecia monachus?_)\r\ncomes up to the south bank of the Upper Amazon, while immediately we cross\r\nover to the north bank we find another species (_Pithecia rufibarbata?_).\r\nAmong birds we have the green jacamar (_Galbula viridis_), abundant on the\r\nnorth bank of the Lower Amazon, while on the south bank we have two allied\r\nspecies (_Galbula rufoviridis_ and _G. cyaneicollis_); and among insects we\r\nhave at Santarem on the south bank of the Amazon, the beautiful blue\r\nbutterfly, _Callithea sapphira_, while almost opposite to it, at\r\nMonte-alegre, an allied species, _Callithea Leprieuri_ is alone found.\r\nPerhaps the most interesting and best known case of a series of allied\r\nspecies, whose ranges are separate but conterminous, is that of the\r\nbeautiful South American wading birds, called trumpeters, and forming the\r\ngenus Psophia. There are five species, all found in the Amazon valley, but\r\neach limited to a well-marked district bounded by great rivers. On the\r\nnorth bank of the Amazon there are two species, one in its lower valley\r\nextending up to the Rio Negro; and the other in the central part of the\r\nvalley beyond that river; while to the south of the Amazon there are three,\r\none above the Madeira, one below it, and a third near Para, probably\r\nseparated from the last by the Tocantins river.\r\n\r\nOverlapping areas among the species of a genus is a more common phenomenon,\r\nand is almost universal where these species are numerous in the same\r\ncontinent. It is, however, exceedingly irregular, so that we often find one\r\n{19} species extending over a considerable portion of the area occupied by\r\nthe genus and including the entire areas of some of the other species. So\r\nlittle has been done to work out accurately the limits of species that it\r\nis very difficult to give examples. One of the best is to be found in the\r\ngenus _Dendroeca_, a group of American wood-warblers. These little birds\r\nall migrate in the winter into the tropical regions, but in the summer they\r\ncome north, each having its particular range. Thus, _D. dominica_ comes as\r\nfar as the middle Eastern States, _D. coerulea_ keeps west of the\r\nAlleghanies, _D. discolor_ comes to Michigan and New England; four other\r\nspecies go farther north in Canada, while several extend to the borders of\r\nthe Arctic zone.\r\n\r\n_The Species of Tits as Illustrating Areas of Distribution._--In our own\r\nhemisphere the overlapping of allied species may be well illustrated by the\r\nvarious kinds of titmice, constituting the genus Parus, several of which\r\nare among our best known English birds. The great titmouse (_Parus major_)\r\nhas the widest range of all, extending from the Arctic circle to Algeria,\r\nPalestine, and Persia, and from Ireland right across Siberia to the Ochotsk\r\nsea, probably following the great northern forest belt. It does not extend\r\ninto China and Japan, where distinct species are found. Next in extent of\r\nrange is the coal tit (_Parus ater_) which inhabits all Europe from the\r\nMediterranean to about 64deg N. latitude, in Asia Minor to the Lebanon and\r\nCaucasus, and across Siberia to Amoorland and Japan. The marsh tit (_Parus\r\npalustris_) inhabits temperate and south Europe from 61deg N. latitude in\r\nNorway to Poland and South-west Russia, and in the south from Spain to Asia\r\nMinor. Closely allied to this--of which it is probably only a variety or\r\nsub-species--is the northern marsh tit (_Parus borealis_), which overlaps\r\nthe last in Norway and Sweden, and also in South Russia and the Alps, but\r\nextends further north into Lapland and North Russia, and thence probably in\r\na south-easterly direction across Central Asia to North China. Yet another\r\nclosely-allied species (_Parus camtschatkensis_) ranges from North-eastern\r\nRussia across Northern Siberia to Lake Baikal and to Hakodadi in Japan,\r\nthus overlapping _Parus borealis_ in the {20} western portion of its area.\r\nOur little favourite, the blue tit (_Parus coeruleus_) ranges over all\r\nEurope from the Arctic circle to the Mediterranean, and on to Asia Minor\r\nand Persia, but does not seem to pass beyond the Ural mountains. Its lovely\r\neastern ally the azure tit (_Parus cyaneus_) overlaps the range of _P.\r\ncoeruleus_ in Western Europe as far as St. Petersburg and Austria, rarely\r\nstraggling to Denmark, while it stretches all across Central Asia between\r\nthe latitudes 35deg and 56deg N. as far as the Amoor valley. Besides these\r\nwide-ranging species there are several others which are more restricted.\r\n_Parus teneriffae_, a beautiful dark blue form of our blue tit, inhabits\r\nNorth-west Africa and the Canaries; _Parus ledouci_, closely allied to our\r\ncoal tit, is found only in Algeria; _Parus lugubris_, allied to the marsh\r\ntit, is confined to South-east Europe and Asia Minor, from Hungary and\r\nSouth Russia to Palestine; and _Parus cinctus_, another allied form, is\r\nconfined to the extreme north in Lapland, Finland, and perhaps Northern\r\nRussia and Siberia. Another beautiful little bird, the crested titmouse\r\n(_Parus cristatus_) is sometimes placed in a separate genus. It inhabits\r\nnearly all Central and South Europe, wherever there are pine forests, from\r\n64deg N. latitude to Austria and North Italy, and in the west to Spain and\r\nGibraltar, while in the east it does not pass the Urals and the Caucasus\r\nrange. Its nearest allies are in the high Himalayas.\r\n\r\nThese are all the European tits, but there are many others inhabiting Asia,\r\nAfrica, and North America; so that the genus Parus has a very wide range,\r\nin Asia to Ceylon and the Malay Islands, in Africa to the Cape, and in\r\nNorth America to the highlands of Mexico.\r\n\r\n_The Distribution of the Species of Jays._--Owing to the very wide range of\r\nseveral of the tits, the uncertainty of the specific distinction of others,\r\nand the difficulty in many cases of ascertaining their actual distribution,\r\nit has not been found practicable to illustrate this genus by means of a\r\nmap. For this purpose we have chosen the genus Garrulus or the jays, in\r\nwhich the species are less numerous, the specific areas less extensive, and\r\nthe species generally better defined; while being large and handsome {21}\r\nbirds they are sure to have been collected, or at least noticed, wherever\r\nthey occur. There are, so far as yet known, twelve species of true jays,\r\noccupying an area extending from Western Europe to Eastern Asia and Japan,\r\nand nowhere passing the Arctic circle to the north, or the tropic of Cancer\r\nto the south, so that they constitute one of the most typical of the\r\nPalaearctic[6] genera. The following are the species, beginning with the\r\nmost westerly and proceeding towards the east. The numbers prefixed to each\r\nspecies correspond to those on the coloured map which forms the\r\nfrontispiece to this volume.\r\n\r\n1. _Garrulus glandarius._--The common jay, inhabits the British Isles and\r\nall Europe except the extreme north, extending also into North Africa,\r\nwhere it has been observed in many parts of Algeria. It occurs near\r\nConstantinople, but apparently not in Asia Minor; and in Russia, up to, but\r\nnot beyond, the Urals. The jays being woodland birds are not found in open\r\nplains or barren uplands, and their distribution is hence by no means\r\nuniform within the area they actually occupy.\r\n\r\n2. _Garrulus cervicalis._--The Algerian jay, is a very distinct species\r\ninhabiting a limited area in North Africa, and found in some places along\r\nwith the common species.\r\n\r\n3. _Garrulus krynicki._--The black-headed jay, is closely allied to the\r\ncommon species, but quite distinct, inhabiting a comparatively small area\r\nin South-eastern Europe, and Western Asia.\r\n\r\n4. _Garrulus atricapillus._--The Syrian jay, is very closely allied to the\r\nlast, and inhabits an adjoining area in Syria, Palestine, and Southern\r\nPersia.\r\n\r\n5. _Garrulus hyrcanus._--The Persian jay, is a small species allied to our\r\njay and only known from the Elburz Mountains in the north of Persia.\r\n\r\n6. _Garrulus brandti._--Brandt's jay, is a very distinct species, having an\r\nextensive range across Asia from the Ural Mountains to North China,\r\nMandchuria, and the northern island of Japan, and also crossing the Urals\r\ninto {22} Russia where it has been found as far west as Kazan in districts\r\nwhere the common jay also occurs.\r\n\r\n7. _Garrulus lanceolatus._--The black-throated jay, is a very distinct form\r\nknown only from the North-western Himalayas and Nepal, common about Simla,\r\nand extending into Cashmere beyond the range of the next species.\r\n\r\n8. _Garrulus bispecularis._--The Himalayan jay is also very distinct,\r\nhaving the head coloured like the back, and not striped as in all the\r\nwestern species. It inhabits the Himalayas east of Cashmere, but is more\r\nabundant in the western than the eastern division, though according to the\r\nAbbe David it reaches Moupin in East Thibet.\r\n\r\n9. _Garrulus sinensis._--The Chinese jay, is very closely allied to the\r\nHimalayan, of which it is sometimes classed as a sub-species. It seems to\r\nbe found in all the southern mountains of China, from Foochow on the east\r\nto Sze-chuen and East Thibet on the west, as it is recorded from Moupin by\r\nthe Abbe David as well as the Himalayan bird--a tolerable proof that it is\r\na distinct form.\r\n\r\n10. _Garrulus taivanus._--The Formosan jay is a very close ally of the\r\npreceding, confined to the island of Formosa.\r\n\r\n11. _Garrulus japonicus._--The Japanese jay is nearly allied to our common\r\nBritish species, being somewhat smaller and less brightly coloured, and\r\nwith black orbits; yet these are the most widely separated species of the\r\ngenus. According to Mr. Seebohm this species is equally allied to the\r\nChinese and Siberian jays.\r\n\r\nIn the accompanying map (see frontispiece) we have laid down the\r\ndistribution of each species so far as it can be ascertained from the works\r\nof Sharpe and Dresser for Europe, Jerdon for India, Swinhoe for China, and\r\nMr. Seebohm's recent work for Japan. There is, however, much uncertainty in\r\nmany places, and gaps have to be filled up conjecturally, while such a\r\nlarge part of Asia is still very imperfectly explored, that considerable\r\nmodifications may have to be made when the country becomes more accurately\r\nknown. But though details may be modified we can hardly suppose that the\r\ngreat features of the several specific areas, or their relations to each\r\nother {23} will be much affected; and these are what we have chiefly to\r\nconsider as bearing on the questions here discussed.\r\n\r\nThe first thing that strikes us on looking at the map, is, the small amount\r\nof overlapping of the several areas, and the isolation of many of the\r\nspecies; while the next most striking feature is the manner in which the\r\nAsiatic species almost surround a vast area in which no jays are found. The\r\nonly species with large areas, are the European _G. glandarius_ and the\r\nAsiatic _G. Brandti_. The former has three species overlapping it--in\r\nAlgeria, in South-eastern and North-eastern Europe respectively. The Syrian\r\njay (No. 4), is not known to occur anywhere with the black-headed jay (No.\r\n3), and perhaps the two areas do not meet. The Persian jay (No. 5), is\r\nquite isolated. The Himalayan and Chinese jays (Nos. 7, 8, and 9) form a\r\ngroup which are isolated from the rest of the genus; while the Japanese jay\r\n(No. 11), is also completely isolated as regards the European jays to which\r\nit is nearly allied. These peculiarities of distribution are no doubt in\r\npart dependent on the habits of the jays, which live only in well-wooded\r\ndistricts, among deciduous trees, and are essentially non-migratory in\r\ntheir habits, though sometimes moving southwards in winter. This will\r\nexplain their absence from the vast desert area of Central Asia, but it\r\nwill not account for the gap between the North and South Chinese species,\r\nnor for the absence of jays from the wooded hills of Turkestan, where Mr.\r\nN. A. Severtzoff collected assiduously, obtaining 384 species of birds but\r\nno jay. These peculiarities, and the fact that jays are never very abundant\r\nanywhere, seem to indicate that the genus is now a decaying one, and that\r\nit has at no very distant epoch occupied a larger and more continuous area,\r\nsuch as that of the genus Parus at the present day.\r\n\r\n_Discontinuous generic Areas._--It is not very easy to find good examples\r\nof genera whose species occupy two or more quite disconnected areas, for\r\nthough such cases may not be rare, we are seldom in a position to mark out\r\nthe limits of the several species with sufficient accuracy. The best and\r\nmost remarkable case among European birds is {24} that of the blue magpies,\r\nforming the genus Cyanopica. One species (_C. cooki_) is confined (as\r\nalready stated) to the wooded and mountainous districts of Spain and\r\nPortugal, while the only other species of the genus (_C. cyanus_) is found\r\nfar away in North-eastern Asia and Japan, so that the two species are\r\nseparated by about 5,000 miles of continuous land. Another case is that of\r\nthe curious little water-moles forming the genus Mygale, one species _M.\r\nmuscovitica_, being found only on the banks of the Volga and Don in\r\nSouth-eastern Russia, while the other, _M. pyrenaica_, is confined to\r\nstreams on the northern side of the Pyrenees. In tropical America there are\r\nfour different kinds of bell-birds belonging to the genus Chasmorhynchus,\r\neach of which appears to inhabit a restricted area completely separated\r\nfrom the others. The most northerly is _C. tricarunculatus_ of Costa Rica\r\nand Veragua, a brown bird with a white head and three long caruncles\r\ngrowing upwards at the base of the beak. Next comes _C. variegatus_, in\r\nVenezuela, a white bird with a brown head and numerous caruncles on the\r\nthroat, perhaps conterminous with the last; in Guiana, extending to near\r\nthe mouth of the Rio Negro, we have _C. niveus_, the bell-bird described by\r\nWaterton, which is pure white, with a single long fleshy caruncle at the\r\nbase of the beak; the last species, _C. nudicollis_, inhabits South-east\r\nBrazil, and is also white, but with black stripes over the eyes, and with a\r\nnaked throat. These birds are about the size of thrushes, and are all\r\nremarkable for their loud, ringing notes, like a bell or a blow on an\r\nanvil, as well as for their peculiar colours. They are therefore known to\r\nthe native Indians wherever they exist, and we may be the more sure that\r\nthey do not spread over the intervening areas where they have never been\r\nfound, and where the natives know nothing of them.\r\n\r\nA good example of isolated species of a group nearer home, is afforded by\r\nthe snow-partridges of the genus Tetraogallus. One species inhabits the\r\nCaucasus range and nowhere else, keeping to the higher slopes from 6,000 to\r\n11,000 feet above the sea, and accompanying the ibex in its wanderings, as\r\nboth feed on the same plants. Another {25} has a wider range in Asia Minor\r\nand Persia, from the Taurus mountains to the South-east corner of the\r\nCaspian Sea; a third species inhabits the Western Himalayas, between the\r\nforests and perpetual snow, extending eastwards to Nepal; while a fourth is\r\nfound on the north side of the mountains in Thibet, and the ranges of these\r\ntwo perhaps overlap; the last species inhabit the Altai mountains, and like\r\nthe two first appears to be completely separated from all its allies.\r\n\r\nThere are some few still more extraordinary cases in which the species of\r\none genus are separated in remote continents or islands. The most striking\r\nof these is that of the tapirs, forming the genus Tapirus, of which there\r\nare two or three species in South America, and one very distinct species in\r\nMalacca and Borneo, separated by nearly half the circumference of the\r\nglobe. Another example among quadrupeds is a peculiar genus of moles named\r\nUrotrichus, of which one species inhabits Japan and the other British\r\nColumbia. The cuckoo-like honey-guides, forming the genus Indicator, are\r\ntolerably abundant in tropical Africa, but there are two outlying species,\r\none in the Eastern Himalaya mountains, the other in Borneo, both very rare,\r\nand recently an allied species has been found in the Malay peninsula. The\r\nbeautiful blue and green thrush-tits forming the genus Cochoa, have two\r\nspecies in the Eastern Himalayas and Eastern China, while the third is\r\nconfined to Java; the curious genus Eupetes, supposed to be allied to the\r\ndippers, has one species in Sumatra and Malacca, while four other species\r\nare found two thousand miles distant in New Guinea; lastly, the lovely\r\nground-thrushes of the genus Pitta, range from Hindostan to Australia,\r\nwhile a single species, far removed from all its near allies, inhabits West\r\nAfrica.\r\n\r\n_Peculiarities of Generic, and Family Distribution._--The examples now\r\ngiven sufficiently illustrate the mode in which the several species of a\r\ngenus are distributed. We have next to consider genera as the component\r\nparts of families, and families of orders, from the same point of view.\r\n{26}\r\n\r\nAll the phenomena presented by the species of a genus are reproduced by the\r\ngenera of a family, and often in a more marked degree. Owing, however, to\r\nthe extreme restriction of genera by modern naturalists, there are not many\r\namong the higher animals that have a world-wide distribution. Among the\r\nmammalia there is no such thing as a truly cosmopolitan genus. This is\r\nowing to the absence of all the higher orders except the mice from\r\nAustralia, while the genus Mus, which occurs there, is represented by a\r\ndistinct group, Hesperomys, in America. If, however, we consider the\r\nAustralian dingo as a native animal we might class the genus Canis as\r\ncosmopolite, but the wild dogs of South America are now formed into\r\nseparate genera by some naturalists. Many genera, however, range over three\r\nor more continents, as Felis (the cat genus) absent only from Australia;\r\nUrsus (the bear genus) absent from Australia and tropical Africa; Cervus\r\n(the deer genus) with nearly the same range; and Sciurus (the squirrel\r\ngenus) found in all the continents but Australia. Among birds Turdus, the\r\nthrush, and Hirundo, the swallow genus, are the only perching birds which\r\nare truly cosmopolites; but there are many genera of hawks, owls, wading\r\nand swimming birds, which have a world-wide range.\r\n\r\nAs a great many genera consist of single species there is no lack of cases\r\nof great restriction, such as the curious lemur called the \"potto,\" which\r\nis found only at Sierra Leone, and forms the genus Perodicticus; the true\r\nchinchillas found only in the Andes of Peru and Chili south of 9deg S. lat.\r\nand between 8,000 and 12,000 feet elevation; several genera of finches each\r\nconfined to limited portions of the higher Himalayas, the blood-pheasants\r\n(Ithaginis) found only above 10,000 feet from Nepal to East Thibet; the\r\nbald-headed starling of the Philippine islands, the lyre-birds of East\r\nAustralia, and a host of others.\r\n\r\nIt is among the different genera of the same family that we meet with the\r\nmost striking examples of discontinuity, although these genera are often as\r\nunmistakably allied as are the species of a genus; and it is these cases\r\nthat furnish the most interesting problems to the student of distribution.\r\n{27} We must therefore consider them somewhat more fully.\r\n\r\nAmong mammalia the most remarkable of these divided families is that of the\r\ncamels, of which one genus Camelus, the true camels, comprising the camel\r\nand dromedary, is confined to Asia, while the other Auchenia, comprising\r\nthe llamas and alpacas, is found only in the high Andes and in the plains\r\nof temperate South America. Not only are these two genera separated by the\r\nAtlantic and by the greater part of the land of two continents, but one is\r\nconfined to the Northern and the other to the Southern hemisphere. The next\r\ncase, though not so well known, is equally remarkable; it is that of the\r\nCentetidae, a family of small insectivorous animals, which are wholly\r\nconfined to Madagascar and the large West Indian islands Cuba and Hayti,\r\nthe former containing five genera and the latter a single genus with a\r\nspecies in each island. Here again we have the whole continent of Africa as\r\nwell as the Atlantic ocean separating allied genera. Two families (or\r\nsubfamilies) of rat-like animals, Octodontidae and Echimyidae, are also\r\ndivided by the Atlantic. Both are mainly South American, but the former has\r\ntwo genera in North and East Africa, and the latter also two in South and\r\nWest Africa. Two other families of mammalia, though confined to the Eastern\r\nhemisphere, are yet markedly discontinuous. The Tragulidae are small\r\ndeer-like animals, known as chevrotains or mouse-deer, abundant in India\r\nand the larger Malay islands and forming the genus Tragulus; while another\r\ngenus, Hyomoschus, is confined to West Africa. The other family is the\r\nSimiidae or anthropoid apes, in which we have the gorilla and chimpanzee\r\nconfined to West and Central Africa, while the allied orangs are found only\r\nin the islands of Sumatra and Borneo, the two groups being separated by a\r\ngreater space than the Echimyidae and other rodents of Africa and South\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nAmong birds and reptiles we have several families, which, from being found\r\nonly within the tropics of Asia, Africa, and America, have been termed\r\ntropicopolitan groups. The Megalaemidae or barbets are gaily coloured {28}\r\nfruit-eating birds, almost equally abundant in tropical Asia and Africa,\r\nbut less plentiful in America, where they probably suffer from the\r\ncompetition of the larger sized toucans. The genera of each country are\r\ndistinct, but all are closely allied, the family being a very natural one.\r\nThe trogons form a family of very gorgeously coloured and remarkable\r\ninsect-eating birds very abundant in tropical America, less so in Asia, and\r\nwith a single genus of two species in Africa.\r\n\r\nAmong reptiles we have two families of snakes--the Dendrophidae or\r\ntree-snakes, and the Dryiophidae or green whip-snakes--which are also found\r\nin the three tropical regions of Asia, Africa, and America, but in these\r\ncases even some of the genera are common to Asia and Africa, or to Africa\r\nand America. The lizards forming the family Amphisbaenidae are divided\r\nbetween tropical Africa and America, a few species only occurring in the\r\nsouthern portion of the adjacent temperate regions; while even the\r\npeculiarly American family of the iguanas is represented by two genera in\r\nMadagascar, and one in the Fiji and Friendly Islands. Passing on to the\r\nAmphibians the worm-like Caeciliadae are tropicopolitan, as are also the\r\ntoads of the family Engystomatidae. Insects also furnish some analogous\r\ncases, three genera of Cicindelidae, (Pogonostoma, Ctenostoma, and\r\nPeridexia) showing a decided connection between this family in South\r\nAmerica and Madagascar; while the beautiful family of diurnal moths,\r\nUraniidae, is confined to the same two countries. A somewhat similar but\r\nbetter known illustration is afforded by the two genera of ostriches, one\r\nconfined to Africa and Arabia, the other to the plains of temperate South\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\n_General features of Overlapping and Discontinuous Areas._--These numerous\r\nexamples of discontinuous genera and families form an important section of\r\nthe facts of animal dispersal which any true theory must satisfactorily\r\naccount for. In greater or less prominence they are to be found all over\r\nthe world, and in every group of animals, and they grade imperceptibly into\r\nthose cases of conterminous and overlapping areas which we have seen to\r\n{29} prevail in most extensive groups of species, and which are perhaps\r\neven more common in those large families which consist of many closely\r\nallied genera. A sufficient proof of the overlapping of generic areas is\r\nthe occurrence of a number of genera of the same family together. Thus in\r\nFrance or Italy about twenty genera of warblers (Sylviadae) are found, and\r\nas each of the thirty-three genera of this family inhabiting temperate\r\nEurope and Asia has a different area, a great number must here overlap. So,\r\nin most parts of Africa, at least ten or twelve genera of antelopes may be\r\nfound, and in South America a large proportion of the genera of monkeys of\r\nthe family Cebidae occur in many districts; and still more is this the case\r\nwith the larger bird families, such as the tanagers, the tyrant shrikes, or\r\nthe tree-creepers, so that there is in all these extensive families no\r\ngenus whose area does not overlap that of many others. Then among the\r\nmoderately extensive families we find a few instances of one or two genera\r\nisolated from the rest, as the spectacled bear, Tremarctos, found only in\r\nChili, while the remainder of the family extends from Europe and Asia over\r\nNorth America to the Mountains of Mexico, but no further south; the\r\nBovidae, or hollow-horned ruminants, which have a few isolated genera in\r\nthe Rocky Mountains and the islands of Sumatra and Celebes; and from these\r\nwe pass on to the cases of wide separation already given.\r\n\r\n_Restricted Areas of Families._--As families sometimes consist of single\r\ngenera and even single species, they often present examples of very\r\nrestricted range; but what is perhaps more interesting are those cases in\r\nwhich a family contains numerous species and sometimes even several genera,\r\nand yet is confined to a narrow area. Such are the golden moles\r\n(Chrysochloridae) consisting of two genera and three species, confined to\r\nextratropical South Africa; the hill-tits (Liotrichidae), a family of\r\nnumerous genera and species mainly confined to the Himalayas, but with a\r\nfew straggling species in the Malay countries and the mountains of China;\r\nthe Pteroptochidae, large wren-like birds, consisting of eight genera and\r\nnineteen species, almost entirely confined to temperate South America and\r\n{30} the Andes; and the birds-of-paradise, consisting of nineteen or twenty\r\ngenera and about thirty-five species, almost all inhabitants of New Guinea\r\nand the immediately surrounding islands, while a few, doubtfully belonging\r\nto the family, extend to East Australia. Among reptiles the most striking\r\ncase of restriction is that of the rough-tailed burrowing snakes\r\n(Uropeltidae), the five genera and eighteen species being strictly confined\r\nto Ceylon and the southern parts of the Indian Peninsula.\r\n\r\n_The Distribution of Orders._--When we pass to the larger groups, termed\r\norders, comprising several families, we find comparatively few cases of\r\nrestriction and many of worldwide distribution; and the families of which\r\nthey are composed are strictly comparable to the genera of which families\r\nare composed, inasmuch as they present examples of overlapping, or\r\nconterminous, or isolated areas, though the latter are comparatively rare.\r\nAmong mammalia the Insectivora offer the best example of an order, several\r\nof whose families inhabit areas more or less isolated from the rest; while\r\nthe Marsupialia have six families in Australia, and one, the opossums, far\r\noff in America.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, more important is the limitation of some entire orders to certain\r\nwell-defined portions of the globe. Thus the Proboscidea, comprising the\r\nsingle family and genus of the elephants, and the Hyracoidea, that of the\r\nHyrax or Syrian coney, are confined to parts of Africa and Asia; the\r\nMarsupials to Australia and America; and the Monotremata, the lowest of all\r\nmammals--comprising the duck-billed Platypus and the spiny Echidna, to\r\nAustralia and New Guinea. Among birds the Struthiones or ostrich tribe are\r\nalmost confined to the three Southern continents, South America, Africa and\r\nAustralia; and among Amphibia the tailed Batrachia--the newts and\r\nsalamanders--are similarly restricted to the northern hemisphere.\r\n\r\nThese various facts will receive their explanation in a future chapter.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n{31}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nCLASSIFICATION OF THE FACTS OF DISTRIBUTION.--ZOOLOGICAL REGIONS\r\n\r\n    The Geographical Divisions of the Globe do not correspond to Zoological\r\n    divisions--The range of British Mammals as indicating a Zoological\r\n    Region--Range of East Asian and North African Mammals--The Range of\r\n    British Birds--Range of East Asian Birds--The limits of the Palaearctic\r\n    Region--Characteristic features of the Palaearctic Region--Definition\r\n    and characteristic groups of the Ethiopian Region--Of the Oriental\r\n    Region--Of the Australian Region--Of the Nearctic Region--Of the\r\n    Neotropical Region--Comparison of Zoological Regions with the\r\n    Geographical Divisions of the Globe.\r\n\r\nHaving now obtained some notion of how animals are dispersed over the\r\nearth's surface, whether as single species or as collected in those groups\r\ntermed genera, families, and orders, it will be well, before proceeding\r\nfurther, to understand something of the classification of the facts we have\r\nbeen considering, and some of the simpler conclusions these facts lead to.\r\n\r\nWe have hitherto described the distribution of species and groups of\r\nanimals by means of the great geographical divisions of the globe in common\r\nuse; but it will have been observed that in hardly any case do these define\r\nthe limits of anything beyond species, and very seldom, or perhaps never,\r\neven those accurately. Thus the term \"Europe\" will not give, with any\r\napproach to accuracy, the range of any one genus of mammals or birds, and\r\n{32} perhaps not that of half-a-dozen species. Either they range into\r\nSiberia, or Asia Minor, or Palestine, or North Africa; and this seems to be\r\nalways the case when their area of distribution occupies a large portion of\r\nEurope. There are, indeed, a few species limited to Central or Western or\r\nSouthern Europe, and these are almost the only cases in which we can use\r\nthe word for zoological purposes without having to add to it some portion\r\nof another continent. Still less useful is the term Asia for this purpose,\r\nsince there is probably no single animal or group confined to Asia which is\r\nnot also more or less nearly confined to the tropical or the temperate\r\nportion of it. The only exception is perhaps the tiger, which may really be\r\ncalled an Asiatic animal, as it occupies nearly two-thirds of the\r\ncontinent; but this is an unique example, while the cases in which Asiatic\r\nanimals and groups are strictly limited to a portion of Asia, or extend\r\nalso into Europe or into Africa or to the Malay Islands, are exceedingly\r\nnumerous. So, in Africa, very few groups of animals range over the whole of\r\nit without going beyond either into Europe or Asia Minor or Arabia, while\r\nthose which are purely African are generally confined to the portion south\r\nof the tropic of Cancer. Australia and America are terms which better serve\r\nthe purpose of the zoologist. The former defines the limit of many\r\nimportant groups of animals; and the same may be said of the latter, but\r\nthe division into North and South America introduces difficulties, for\r\nalmost all the groups especially characteristic of South America are found\r\nalso beyond the isthmus of Panama, in what is geographically part of the\r\nnorthern continent.\r\n\r\nIt being thus clear that the old and popular divisions of the globe are\r\nvery inconvenient when used to describe the range of animals, we are\r\nnaturally led to ask whether any other division can be made which will be\r\nmore useful, and will serve to group together a considerable number of the\r\nfacts we have to deal with. Such a division was made by Mr. P. L. Sclater\r\nmore than twenty years ago, and it has, with some slight modifications,\r\ncome into pretty general use in this country, and to some extent also {33}\r\nabroad; we shall therefore proceed to explain its nature and the principles\r\non which it is established, as it will have to be often referred to in\r\nfuture chapters of this work, and will take the place of the old\r\ngeographical divisions whose inconvenience has already been pointed out.\r\nThe primary zoological divisions of the globe are called \"regions,\" and we\r\nwill begin by ascertaining the limits of the region of which our own\r\ncountry forms a part.\r\n\r\n_The Range of British Mammals as indicating a Zoological Region._--We will\r\nfirst take our commonest wild mammalia and see how far they extend, and\r\nespecially whether they are confined to Europe or range over parts of other\r\ncontinents:\r\n\r\n   1. Wild Cat  | Europe | N. Africa | Siberia, Afghanistan.\r\n   2. Fox       | Europe | N. Africa | Central Asia to Amoor.\r\n   3. Weasel    | Europe | N. Africa | Central Asia to Amoor.\r\n   4. Otter     | Europe | N. Africa | Siberia.\r\n   5. Badger    | Europe | N. Africa | Central Asia to Amoor.\r\n   6. Stag      | Europe | N. Africa | Central Asia to Amoor.\r\n   7. Hedgehog  | Europe |    --     | Central Asia to Amoor.\r\n   8. Mole      | Europe |    --     | Central Asia.\r\n   9. Squirrel  | Europe |    --     | Central Asia to Amoor.\r\n  10. Dormouse  | Europe |    --     |      --\r\n  11. Water-rat | Europe |    --     | Central Asia to Amoor.\r\n  12. Hare      | Europe |    --     | W. Siberia, Persia.\r\n  13. Rabbit    | Europe | N. Africa |      --\r\n\r\nWe thus see that out of thirteen of our commonest quadrupeds only one is\r\nconfined to Europe, while seven are found also in Northern Africa, and\r\neleven range into Siberia, most of them stretching quite across Asia to the\r\nvalley of the Amoor on the extreme eastern side of that continent. Two of\r\nthe above-named British species, the fox and weasel, are also inhabitants\r\nof the New World, being as common in the northern parts of North America as\r\nthey are with us; but with these exceptions the entire range of our\r\ncommoner species is given, and they clearly show that all Northern Asia and\r\nNorthern Africa must be added to Europe in order to form the region which\r\nthey collectively inhabit. If now we go into Central Europe and take, for\r\nexample, the quadrupeds of Germany, we shall find that these too, although\r\nmuch more numerous, are confined to the same limits, except that some of\r\nthe {34} more arctic kinds, as already stated, extend into the colder\r\nregions of North America.\r\n\r\n_Range of East Asian and North African Mammals._--Let us now pass to the\r\nother side of the great northern continent, and examine the list of the\r\nquadrupeds of Amoorland, in the same latitude as Germany. We find that\r\nthere are forty-four terrestrial species (omitting the bats, the seals, and\r\nother marine animals), and of these no less than twenty-six are identical\r\nwith European species, and twelve or thirteen more are closely allied\r\nrepresentatives, leaving only five or six which are peculiarly Asiatic. We\r\ncan hardly have a more convincing proof of the essential oneness of the\r\nmammalia of Europe and Northern Asia.\r\n\r\nIn Northern Africa we do not find so many European species (though even\r\nhere they are very numerous) because a considerable number of West Asiatic\r\nand desert forms occur. Having, however, shown that Europe and Western Asia\r\nhave almost identical animals, we may treat all these as really European,\r\nand we shall then be able to compare the quadrupeds of North Africa with\r\nthose of Europe and West Asia. Taking those of Algeria as the best known,\r\nwe find that there are thirty-three species identical with those of Europe\r\nand West Asia, while twenty-four more, though distinct, are closely allied,\r\nbelonging to the same genera; thus making a total of fifty-seven of\r\nEuropean type. On the other hand, we have seven species which are either\r\nidentical with species of tropical Africa or allied to them, and six more\r\nwhich are especially characteristic of the African and Asiatic deserts\r\nwhich form a kind of neutral zone between the temperate and tropical\r\nregions. If now we consider that Algeria and the adjacent countries\r\nbordering the Mediterranean form part of Africa, while they are separated\r\nfrom Europe by a wide sea and are only connected with Asia by a narrow\r\nisthmus, we cannot but feel surprised at the wonderful preponderance of the\r\nEuropean and West Asiatic elements in the mammalia which inhabit the\r\ndistrict.\r\n\r\n_The Range of British Birds._--As it is very important that no doubt should\r\nexist as to the limits of the zoological {35} region of which Europe forms\r\na part, we will now examine the birds, in order to see how far they agree\r\nin their distribution with the mammalia. Of late years great attention has\r\nbeen paid to the distribution of European and Asiatic birds, many\r\nornithologists having travelled in North Africa, in Palestine, in Asia\r\nMinor, in Persia, in Siberia, in Mongolia, and in China; so that we are now\r\nable to determine the exact ranges of many species in a manner that would\r\nhave been impossible a few years ago. These ranges are given for all\r\nBritish species in the new edition of Yarrell's _History of British Birds_\r\nedited by Professor Newton, while those of all European birds are given in\r\nstill more detail in Mr. Dresser's beautiful work on the birds of Europe.\r\nIn order to confine our examination within reasonable limits, and at the\r\nsame time give it the interest attaching to familiar objects, we will take\r\nthe whole series of British Passeres or perching birds given in Professor\r\nNewton's work (118 in number) and arrange them in series according to the\r\nextent of their range. These include not only the permanent residents and\r\nregular migrants to our country, but also those which occasionally straggle\r\nhere, so that it really comprises a large proportion of all European birds.\r\n\r\nI.

BRITISH BIRDS CONFINED TO EUROPE.\r\n\r\n   1. _Cinclus aquaticus_          Dipper (closely allied races inhabit\r\n                                   other parts of the Palaearctic Region).\r\n   2. _Parus cristatus_            Crested Titmouse.\r\n  {38}\r\n   3. _Anthus obscurus_            Rock Pipit.\r\n   4. _Linota rufescens_           Lesser Redpoll (closely allied races in\r\n                                   N. Asia and N. America).\r\n   5. _Loxia pityopsittacus_       Parrot Crossbill (a closely allied form\r\n                                   in N. Asia).\r\n\r\nWe find, that out of a total of 118 British Passeres there are:\r\n\r\n    32 species which range to North Africa and Central or East Asia.\r\n\r\n    25 species which range to Central or East Asia, but not to North\r\n    Africa.\r\n\r\n    43 species which range to North Africa and Western Asia.\r\n\r\n    6 species which range to North Africa, but not at all into Asia.\r\n\r\n    7 species which range to West Asia, but not to North Africa.\r\n\r\n    5 species which do not range out of Europe.\r\n\r\nThese figures agree essentially with those furnished by the mammalia, and\r\ncomplete the demonstration that all the temperate portions of Asia and\r\nNorth Africa must be added to Europe to form a natural zoological division\r\nof the earth. We must also note how comparatively few of these overpass the\r\nlimits thus indicated; only seven species extending their range\r\noccasionally into tropical or South Africa, eight into some parts of\r\ntropical Asia, and six into arctic or temperate North America.\r\n\r\n_Range of East Asian Birds._--To complete the evidence we only require to\r\nknow that the East Asiatic birds are as much like those of Europe, as we\r\nhave already shown to be the case when we take the point of departure from\r\nour end of the continent. This does not follow necessarily, because it is\r\npossible that a totally distinct North Asiatic fauna might there prevail;\r\nand, although our birds go eastward to the remotest parts of Asia, their\r\nbirds might not come westward to Europe. The birds of Eastern Siberia have\r\nbeen carefully studied by Russian naturalists and afford us the means of\r\nmaking the required comparison. There are 151 species belonging to the\r\norders Passeres and Picariae (the perching and climbing birds), and of\r\nthese no less than 77, or more than half, are absolutely identical {39}\r\nwith European species; 63 are peculiar to North Asia, but all except five\r\nor six of these are allied to European forms; the remaining 11 species are\r\nmigrants from South-eastern Asia. The resemblance is therefore equally\r\nclose whichever extremity of the Euro-Asiatic continent we take as our\r\nstarting point, and is equally remarkable in birds as in mammalia. We have\r\nnow only to determine the limits of this, our first zoological region,\r\nwhich has been termed the \"Palaearctic\" by Mr. Sclater, meaning the\r\n\"northern old-world\" region--a name now well known to naturalists.\r\n\r\n_The Limits of the Palaearctic Region._--The boundaries of this region, as\r\nnearly as they can be ascertained, are shown on our general map at the\r\nbeginning of this chapter, but it will be evident on consideration, that,\r\nexcept in a few places, its limits can only be approximately defined. On\r\nthe north, east, and west it extends to the ocean, and includes a number of\r\nislands whose peculiarities will be pointed out in a subsequent chapter; so\r\nthat the southern boundary alone remains, but as this runs across the\r\nentire continent from the Atlantic to the Pacific ocean, often traversing\r\nlittle-known regions, we may perhaps never be able to determine it\r\naccurately, even if it admits of such determination. In drawing the\r\nboundary line across Africa we meet with our first difficulty. The\r\nEuro-Asiatic animals undoubtedly extend to the northern borders of the\r\nSahara, while those of tropical Africa come up to its southern margin, the\r\ndesert itself forming a kind of sandy ocean between them. Some of the\r\nspecies on either side penetrate and even cross the desert, but it is\r\nimpossible to balance these with any accuracy, and it has therefore been\r\nthought best, as a mere matter of convenience, to consider the geographical\r\nline of the tropic of Cancer to form the boundary. We are thus enabled to\r\ndefine the Palaearctic region as including all north temperate Africa; and,\r\na similar intermingling of animal types occurring in Arabia, the same\r\nboundary line is continued to the southern shore of the Persian Gulf.\r\nPersia and Afghanistan undoubtedly belong to the Palaearctic region, and\r\nBaluchistan should probably go with these. The boundary in the\r\nnorth-western part of India is again difficult to determine, but it {40}\r\ncannot be far one way or the other from the river Indus as far up as\r\nAttock, opposite the mouth of the Cabool river. Here it will bend to the\r\nsouth-east, passing a little south of Cashmeer, and along the southern\r\nslopes of the Himalayas into East Thibet and China, at heights varying from\r\n9,000 to 11,000 feet according to soil, aspect, and shelter. It may,\r\nperhaps, be defined as extending to the upper belt of forests as far as\r\nconiferous trees prevail; but the temperate and tropical faunas are here so\r\nintermingled that to draw any exact parting line is impossible. The two\r\nfaunas are, however, very distinct. In and above the pine woods there are\r\nabundance of warblers of northern genera, with wrens, numerous titmice, and\r\na great variety of buntings, grosbeaks, bullfinches and rosefinches, all\r\nmore or less nearly allied to the birds of Europe and Northern Asia; while\r\na little lower down we meet with a host of peculiar birds allied to those\r\nof tropical Asia and the Malay Islands, but often of distinct genera. There\r\ncan be no doubt, therefore, of the existence here of a pretty sharp line of\r\ndemarkation between the temperate and tropical faunas, though this line\r\nwill be so irregular, owing to the complex system of valleys and ridges,\r\nthat in our present ignorance of much of the country it cannot be marked in\r\ndetail on any map.\r\n\r\nFurther east in China it is still more difficult to determine the limits of\r\nthe region, owing to the great intermixture of migrating birds; tropical\r\nforms passing northwards in summer as far as the Amoor river, while the\r\nnorthern forms visit every part of China in winter. From what we know,\r\nhowever, of the distribution of some of the more typical northern and\r\nsouthern species, we are able to fix the limits of the Palaearctic region a\r\nlittle south of Shanghai on the east coast. Several tropical genera come as\r\nfar north as Ningpo or even Shanghai, but rarely beyond; while in Formosa\r\nand Amoy tropical forms predominate. Such decidedly northern forms as\r\nbullfinches and hawfinches are found at Shanghai; hence we may commence the\r\nboundary line on the coast between Shanghai and Ningpo, but inland it\r\nprobably bends a little southward, and then northward to the mountains and\r\nvalleys of West {41} China and East Thibet in about 32deg N. latitude;\r\nwhere, at Moupin, a French missionary, Pere David, made extensive\r\ncollections showing this district to be at the junction of the tropical and\r\ntemperate faunas. Japan, as a whole, is decidedly Palaearctic, although its\r\nextreme southern portion, owing to its mild insular climate and evergreen\r\nvegetation, gives shelter to a number of tropical forms.\r\n\r\n_Characteristic Features of the Palaearctic Region._--Having thus\r\ndemonstrated the unity of the Palaearctic region by tracing out the\r\ndistribution of a large proportion of its mammalia and birds, it only\r\nremains to show how far it is characterised by peculiar groups such as\r\ngenera and families, and to say a few words on the lower forms of life\r\nwhich prevail in it.\r\n\r\nTaking first the mammalia, we find this region distinguished by possessing\r\ntwo peculiar genera of Talpidae or moles, the family being confined to the\r\nPalaearctic and Nearctic regions. The true hedgehogs (Erinaceus) are also\r\ncharacteristic, being only found elsewhere in South Africa and in the\r\nnorthern part of the Oriental region. Among Carnivora, the racoon-dog\r\n(Nyctereutes) of North-eastern Asia, and the true badgers of the genus\r\nMeles are peculiar, most other parts of the world possessing distinct\r\ngenera of badgers. It has six peculiar genera, or subgenera, of deer; seven\r\npeculiar genera of Bovidae, chiefly antelopes; while the entire group of\r\ngoats and sheep, comprising twenty-two species, is almost confined to it,\r\none species only occurring in the Rocky mountains of North America and\r\nanother in the Nilgiris of Southern India. Among the rodents there are nine\r\ngenera with twenty-seven species wholly confined to it, while several\r\nothers, as the hamsters, the dormice, and the pikas, have only a few\r\nspecies elsewhere.\r\n\r\nIn birds there are a large number of peculiar genera of which we need\r\nmention only a few of the more important, as the grass-hopper warblers\r\n(Locustella) with seven species, the Accentors with twelve species, and\r\nabout a dozen other genera of warblers, including the robins; the bearded\r\ntitmouse and several allied genera; the long-tailed titmice forming the\r\ngenus Acredula; the magpies, choughs, and nut-crackers; a host of finches,\r\namong which the bullfinches (Pyrrhula) and the buntings (Emberiza) are the\r\n{42} most important. The true pheasants (Phasianus) are wholly Palaearctic,\r\nexcept one species in Formosa, as are several genera of wading birds.\r\nThough the reptiles of cold countries are few as compared with those of the\r\ntropics, the Palaearctic region in its warmer portions has a considerable\r\nnumber, and among these are many which are peculiar to it. Such are four\r\ngenera of snakes, seven of lizards, five of frogs and toads, and twelve of\r\nnewts and salamanders; while of fresh-water fishes there are about twenty\r\npeculiar genera.[7] Among insects we may mention the elegant Apollo\r\nbutterflies of the Alps as forming a peculiar genus (Parnassius), only\r\nfound elsewhere in the Rocky Mountains of North America, while the\r\nbeautiful genus Thais of the south of Europe and Sericinus of North China\r\nare equally remarkable. Among other insects we can only now refer to the\r\ngreat family of Carabidae, or predaceous ground-beetles, which are\r\nimmensely numerous in this region, there being about fifty peculiar genera;\r\nwhile the large and handsome genus Carabus, with its allies Procerus and\r\nProcrustes, containing nearly 300 species, is almost wholly confined to\r\nthis region, and would alone serve to distinguish it zoologically from all\r\nother parts of the globe.\r\n\r\n{43}\r\n\r\nHaving given so full an exposition of the facts which determine the extent\r\nand boundaries of the Palaearctic region, there is less need of entering\r\ninto much detail as regards the other regions of the Eastern Hemisphere;\r\ntheir boundaries being easily defined, while their forms of animal life are\r\nwell marked and strongly contrasted.\r\n\r\n_Definition and Characteristic Groups of the Ethiopian Region._--The\r\nEthiopian region consists of all tropical and south Africa, to which are\r\nappended the large island of Madagascar and the Mascarene Islands to the\r\neast and north of it, though these differ materially from the continent,\r\nand will have to be discussed in a separate chapter. For the present, then,\r\nwe will take Africa south of the tropic of Cancer, and consider how far its\r\nanimals are distinct from those of the Palaearctic region.\r\n\r\nTaking first the mammalia, we find the following remarkable animals at once\r\nseparating it from the Palaearctic and every other region. The gorilla and\r\nchimpanzee, the baboons, numerous lemurs, the spotted hyaena, the aard-wolf\r\nand hyaena-dog, zebras, the hippopotamus, giraffe, and more than seventy\r\npeculiar antelopes. Here we have a wonderful collection of large and\r\npeculiar quadrupeds, but the Ethiopian region is also characterised by the\r\nabsence of others which are not only abundant in the Palaearctic region but\r\nin many tropical regions as well. The most remarkable of these deficiencies\r\nare the bears the deer and the wild oxen, all of which abound in the\r\ntropical parts of Asia while bears and deer extend into both North and\r\nSouth America. Besides the large and conspicuous animals mentioned above,\r\nAfrica possesses a number of completely isolated groups; such are the\r\npotamogale, a curious otter-like water-shrew, discovered by Du Chaillu in\r\nWest Africa, so distinct as to constitute a new family, Potamogalidae; the\r\ngoldenmoles, also forming a peculiar family, Chrysochloridae; as do the\r\nelephant-shrews, Macroscelididae; the singular aard-varks, or earth-pigs,\r\nforming a peculiar family of Edentata called Orycteropodidae; while there\r\nare numerous peculiar genera of monkeys, swine, civets, and rodents.\r\n\r\nAmong birds the most conspicuous and remarkable are, the great-billed\r\nvulture-crows (Corvultur), the long-tailed {44} whydah finches (Vidua), the\r\ncurious ox-peckers (Buphaga), the splendid metallic starlings\r\n(Lamprocolius), the handsome plantain-eaters (Musophaga), the\r\nground-hornbills (Bucorvus), the numerous guinea-fowls belonging to four\r\ndistinct genera, the serpent-eating secretary-bird (Serpentarius), the huge\r\nboat-billed heron (Balaeniceps), and the true ostriches. There are also\r\nthree quite peculiar African families, the Musophagidae or plantain-eaters,\r\nincluding the elegant crested touracos; the curious little finch-like\r\ncolies (Coliidae), and the Irrisoridae, insect-eating birds allied to the\r\nhoopoes but with glossy metallic plumage and arboreal habits.\r\n\r\nIn reptiles, fishes, insects, and land-shells, Africa is very rich, and\r\npossesses an immense number of peculiar forms. These are not sufficiently\r\nfamiliar to require notice in a work of this character, but we may mention\r\na few as mere illustrations: the puff-adders, the most hideous of poisonous\r\nsnakes; the chameleons, the most remarkable of lizards; the\r\ngoliath-beetles, the largest and handsomest of the Cetoniidae; and some of\r\nthe Achatinae, which are the largest of all known land-shells.\r\n\r\n_Definition and Characteristic Groups of the Oriental Region._--The\r\nOriental region comprises all Asia south of the Palaearctic limits, and\r\nalong with this the Malay Islands as far as the Philippines, Borneo, and\r\nJava. It was called the Indian region by Mr. Sclater, but this term has\r\nbeen objected to because the Indo-Chinese and Malayan districts are the\r\nrichest and most characteristic, while the peninsula of India is the\r\npoorest portion of it. The name \"Oriental\" has therefore been adopted in my\r\nwork on _The Geographical Distribution of Animals_ as preferable to either\r\nMalayan or Indo-Australian, both of which have been proposed, but are\r\nobjectionable, as being already in use in a different sense.\r\n\r\nThe great features of the mammals of the Oriental region are, the\r\nlong-armed apes, the orang-utans, the tiger, the sun-bears and honey-bears,\r\nthe tapir, the chevrotains or mouse-deer, and the Indian elephant. Its most\r\nconspicuous birds are the immense number and variety of babbling-thrushes\r\n(Timaliidae), its beautiful little hill-tits (Liotrichidae), its green\r\nbulbuls (Phyllornithidae), its many varieties {45} of the crow-family, its\r\nbeautiful gapers and pittas adorned with the most delicate colours, its\r\ngreat variety of hornbills, and its magnificent Phasianidae, comprising the\r\npeacocks, argus-pheasants, fire-backed pheasants, and jungle-fowl. Many of\r\nthese are, it is true, absent from the peninsula of Hindostan, but\r\nsufficient remain there to ally it with the other parts of the region.\r\n\r\nAmong the remarkable but less conspicuous forms of mammalia which are\r\npeculiar to this region are, monkeys of the genus Presbyter, extending to\r\nevery part of it; lemurs of three peculiar genera--Nycticebus and Loris\r\n(slow lemurs) and Tarsius (spectre lemurs); the flying lemur\r\n(Galeopithecus), now classed as a peculiar family of Insectivora and found\r\nonly in the Malay Islands; the family of the Tupaias, or squirrel-shrews,\r\ncurious little arboreal Insectivora somewhat resembling squirrels; no less\r\nthan twelve peculiar genera of the civet family, three peculiar antelopes,\r\nfive species of rhinoceros, and the round-tailed flying squirrels forming\r\nthe genus Pteromys.\r\n\r\nOf the peculiar groups of birds we can only mention a few. The curious\r\nlittle tailor-birds of the genus Orthotomus are found over the whole region\r\nand almost alone serve to characterise it, as do the fine\r\nlaughing-thrushes, forming the genus Garrulax; while the beautiful\r\ngrass-green fruit-thrushes (Phyllornis), and the brilliant little minivets\r\n(Pericrocotus), are almost equally universal. Woodpeckers are abundant,\r\nbelonging to a dozen peculiar genera; while gaudy barbets and strange forms\r\nof cuckoos and hornbills are also to be met with everywhere. Among game\r\nbirds, the only genus that is universally distributed, and which may be\r\nsaid to characterise the region, is Gallus, comprising the true\r\njungle-fowl, one of which, Gallus bankiva, is found from the Himalayas and\r\nCentral India to Malacca, Java, and even eastward to Timor, and is the\r\nundoubted origin of almost all our domestic poultry. Southern India and\r\nCeylon each possesses distinct species of jungle-fowl, and a third very\r\nhandsome green bird (Gallus aeneus inhabits Java.)\r\n\r\nReptiles are as abundant as in Africa, but they present no well-known\r\ngroups which can be considered as specially characteristic. Among insects\r\nwe may notice the {46} magnificent golden and green Papilionidae of various\r\ngenera as being unequalled in the world; while the great Atlas moth is\r\nprobably the most gigantic of Lepidoptera, being sometimes ten inches\r\nacross the wings, which are also very broad. Among the beetles the strange\r\nflat-bodied Malayan mormolyce is the largest of all the Carabidae, while\r\nthe catoxantha is equally a giant among the Buprestidae. On the whole, the\r\ninsects of this region probably surpass those of any other part of the\r\nworld, except South America, in size, variety, and beauty.\r\n\r\n_Definition and Characteristic Groups of the Australian Region._--The\r\nAustralian region is so well marked off from the Oriental, as well as from\r\nall other parts of the world, by zoological peculiarities, that we need not\r\ntake up much time in describing it, especially as some of its component\r\nislands will come under review at a subsequent stage of our work. Its most\r\nimportant portions are Australia and New Guinea, but it also includes all\r\nthe Malayan and Pacific Islands to the east of Borneo, Java, and Bali, the\r\nOriental region terminating with the submarine bank on which those islands\r\nare situated. The island of Celebes is included in this region from a\r\nbalance of considerations, but it almost equally well belongs to the\r\nOriental, and must be left out of the account in our general sketch of the\r\nzoological features of the Australian region.\r\n\r\nThe great feature of the Australian region is the almost total absence of\r\nall the forms of terrestrial mammalia which abound in the rest of the\r\nworld, their place being supplied by a great variety of Marsupials. In\r\nAustralia and New Guinea there are no Insectivora, Carnivora, nor Ungulata,\r\nwhile even the rodents are only represented by a few small rats and mice.\r\nIn the remoter Pacific Islands mammals are altogether absent (except\r\nperhaps in New Zealand), but in the Moluccas and other islands bordering on\r\nthe Oriental region the higher mammals are represented by a few deer,\r\ncivets, and pigs, though it is doubtful whether the two former may not have\r\nbeen introduced by man, as was almost certainly the case with the\r\nsemi-domesticated dingo of Australia.[8] These peculiarities in the\r\nmammalia {47} are so great that every naturalist agrees that Australia must\r\nbe made a separate region, the only difference of opinion being as to its\r\nextent, some thinking that New Zealand should form another separate region;\r\nbut this question need not now delay us.\r\n\r\nIn birds Australia is by no means so isolated from the rest of the world,\r\nas it contains great numbers of warblers, thrushes, flycatchers, shrikes,\r\ncrows, and other familiar types of the Eastern Hemisphere; yet a\r\nconsiderable number of the most characteristic Oriental families are\r\nabsent. Thus there are no vultures, woodpeckers, pheasants, bulbuls, or\r\nbarbets in the Australian region; and the absence of these is almost as\r\nmarked a feature as that of cats, deer, or monkeys, among mammalia. The\r\nmost conspicuous and characteristic birds of the Australian region are, the\r\npiping crows; the honey-suckers (Meliphagidae), a family quite peculiar to\r\nthe region; the lyre-birds; the great terrestrial kingfishers (Dacelo); the\r\ngreat goat-suckers called more-porks in Australia and forming the genus\r\nPodargus; the wonderful abundance of parrots, including such remarkable\r\nforms as the white and black cockatoos, and the gorgeously coloured\r\nbrush-tongued lories; the almost equal abundance of fine pigeons more gaily\r\ncoloured than any others on the globe; the strange brush-turkeys and\r\nmound-builders, the only birds that {48} never sit upon their eggs, but\r\nallow them to be hatched, reptile-like, by the heat of the sand or of\r\nfermenting vegetable matter; and lastly, the emus and cassowaries, in which\r\nthe wings are far more rudimentary than in the ostriches of Africa and\r\nSouth America. New Guinea and the surrounding islands are remarkable for\r\ntheir tree-kangaroos, their birds-of-paradise, their raquet-tailed\r\nkingfishers, their great crown-pigeons, their crimson lories, and many\r\nother remarkable birds. This brief outline being sufficient to show the\r\ndistinctness and isolation of the Australian region, we will now pass to\r\nthe consideration of the Western Hemisphere.\r\n\r\n_Definition and Characteristic Groups of the Nearctic Region._--The\r\nNearctic region comprises all temperate and arctic North America, including\r\nGreenland, the only doubt being as to its southern boundary, many northern\r\ntypes penetrating into the tropical zone by means of the highlands and\r\nvolcanic peaks of Mexico and Guatemala, while a few which are\r\ncharacteristic of the tropics extend northward into Texas and California.\r\nThere is, however, considerable evidence showing that on the east coast the\r\nRio Grande del Norte, and on the west a point nearly opposite Cape St.\r\nLucas, form the most natural boundary; but instead of being drawn straight\r\nacross, the line bends to the south-east as soon as it rises on the flanks\r\nof the table-land, forming a deep loop which extends some distance beyond\r\nthe city of Mexico, and perhaps ought to be continued along the higher\r\nridges of Guatemala.\r\n\r\nThe Nearctic region is so similar to the Palaearctic in position and\r\nclimate, and the two so closely approach each other at Behring Straits,\r\nthat we cannot wonder at there being a certain amount of similarity between\r\nthem--a similarity which some naturalists have so far over-estimated as to\r\nthink that the two regions ought to be united. Let us therefore carefully\r\nexamine the special zoological features of this region, and see how far it\r\nresembles, and how far differs from, the Palaearctic.\r\n\r\nAt first sight the mammalia of North America do not seem to differ much\r\nfrom those of Europe or Northern Asia. There are cats, lynxes, wolves and\r\nfoxes, weasels, bears, elk and deer, voles, beavers, squirrels, marmots,\r\nand {49} hares, all very similar to those of the Eastern Hemisphere, and\r\nseveral hardly distinguishable. Even the bison or \"buffalo\" of the\r\nprairies, once so abundant and characteristic, is a close ally of the now\r\nalmost extinct \"aurochs\" of Lithuania. Here, then, we undoubtedly find a\r\nvery close resemblance between the two regions, and if this were all, we\r\nshould have great difficulty in separating them. But along with these, we\r\nfind another set of mammals, not quite so conspicuous but nevertheless very\r\nimportant. We have first, three peculiar genera of moles, one of which, the\r\nstar-nosed mole, is a most extraordinary creature, quite unlike anything\r\nelse. Then there are three genera of the weasel family, including the\r\nwell-known skunk (Mephitis), all quite different from Eastern forms. Then\r\nwe come to a peculiar family of carnivora, the racoons, very distinct from\r\nanything in Europe or Asia; and in the Rocky Mountains we find the\r\nprong-horn antelope (Antilocapra) and the mountain goat of the trappers\r\n(Aplocerus), both peculiar genera. Coming to the rodents we find that the\r\nmice of America differ in some dental peculiarities from those of the rest\r\nof the world, and thus form several distinct genera; the jumping mouse\r\n(Xapus) is a peculiar form of the jerboa family, and then we come to the\r\npouched rats (Geomyidae), a very curious family consisting of four genera\r\nand nineteen species, peculiar to North America, though not confined to the\r\nNearctic region. The prairie dogs (Cynomys), the tree porcupine\r\n(Erethizon), the curious sewellel (Haploodon), and the opossum (Didelphys)\r\ncomplete the list of peculiar mammalia which distinguish the northern\r\nregion of the new world from that of the old. We must add to these\r\npeculiarities some remarkable deficiencies. The Nearctic region has no\r\nhedgehogs, nor wild pigs, nor dormice, and only one wild sheep in the Rocky\r\nMountains as against twenty species of sheep and goats in the Palaearctic\r\nregion.\r\n\r\nIn birds also the similarities to our own familiar songsters first strike\r\nus, though the differences are perhaps really greater than in the\r\nquadrupeds. We see thrushes and wrens, tits and finches, and what seem to\r\nbe warblers and flycatchers and starlings in abundance; but a closer\r\nexamination shows the ornithologist that what he took for the {50} latter\r\nare really quite distinct, and that there is not a single true flycatcher\r\nof the family Muscicapidae, or a single starling of the family Sturnidae in\r\nthe whole continent, while there are very few true warblers (Sylviidae),\r\ntheir place being taken by the quite distinct families Mniotiltidae or\r\nwood-warblers, and Vireonidae or greenlets. In like manner the flycatchers\r\nof America belong to the totally distinct family of tyrant-birds,\r\nTyrannidae, and those that look like starlings to the hang-nests,\r\nIcteridae; and these four peculiar families comprise about a hundred and\r\ntwenty species, and give a special character to the ornithology of the\r\ncountry. Add to these such peculiar birds as the mocking thrushes (Mimus),\r\nthe blue jays (Cyanocitta), the tanagers, the peculiar genera of cuckoos\r\n(Coccygus and Crotophaga), the humming-birds, the wild turkeys (Meleagris),\r\nand the turkey-buzzards (Cathartes), and we see that if there is any doubt\r\nas to the mammals of North America being sufficiently distinct to justify\r\nthe creation of a separate region, the evidence of the birds would alone\r\nsettle the question.\r\n\r\nThe reptiles, and some others of the lower animals, add still more to this\r\nweight of evidence. The true rattlesnakes are highly characteristic, and\r\namong the lizards are several genera of the peculiar American family, the\r\nIguanidae. Nowhere in the world are the tailed batrachians so largely\r\ndeveloped as in this region, the Sirens and the Amphiumidae forming two\r\npeculiar families, while there are nine peculiar genera of salamanders, and\r\ntwo others allied respectively to the Proteus of Europe and the Sieboldia\r\nor giant salamander of Japan. There are seven peculiar families and about\r\nthirty peculiar genera of fresh-water fishes; while the fresh-water\r\nmolluscs are more numerous than in any other region, more than thirteen\r\nhundred species and varieties having been described.\r\n\r\nCombining the evidence derived from all these classes of animals, we find\r\nthe Nearctic region to be exceedingly well characterised, and to be amply\r\ndistinct from the Palaearctic. The few species that are common to the two\r\nare almost all arctic, or, at least, northern types, and may be compared\r\nwith those desert forms which occupy the debatable ground between the\r\nPalaearctic, Ethiopian, and Oriental regions. {51} If, however, we compare\r\nthe number of species, which are common to the Nearctic and Palaearctic\r\nregions with the number common to the western and eastern extremities of\r\nthe latter region, we shall find a wonderful difference between the two\r\ncases; and if we further call to mind the number of important groups\r\ncharacteristic of the one region but absent from the other, we shall be\r\nobliged to admit that the relation that undoubtedly exists between the\r\nfaunas of North America and Europe is of a very distinct nature from that\r\nwhich connects together Western Europe and North-eastern Asia in the bonds\r\nof zoological unity.\r\n\r\n_Definition and Characteristic Groups of the Neotropical Region._--The\r\nNeotropical region requires very little definition, since it comprises the\r\nwhole of America south of the Nearctic region, with the addition of the\r\nAntilles or West Indian Islands. Its zoological peculiarities are almost as\r\nmarked as those of Australia, which, however, it far exceeds in the extreme\r\nrichness and variety of all its forms of life. To show how distinct it is\r\nfrom all the other regions of the globe, we need only enumerate some of the\r\nbest known and more conspicuous of the animal forms which are peculiar to\r\nit. Such are, among mammalia--the prehensile-tailed monkeys and the\r\nmarmosets, the blood-sucking bats, the coati-mundis, the peccaries, the\r\nllamas and alpacas, the chinchillas, the agoutis, the sloths, the\r\narmadillos, and the ant-eaters; a series of types more varied, and more\r\ndistinct from those of the rest of the world than any other continent can\r\nboast of. Among birds we have the charming sugar-birds, forming the family\r\nCoerebidae; the immense and wonderfully varied group of tanagers; the\r\nexquisite little manakins, and the gorgeously-coloured chatterers; the host\r\nof tree-creepers of the family Dendrocolaptidae; the wonderful toucans; the\r\npuff-birds, jacamars, todies and motmots; the marvellous assemblage of four\r\nhundred distinct kinds of humming-birds; the gorgeous macaws; the\r\ncurassows, the trumpeters, and the sun-bitterns. Here again there is no\r\nother continent or region that can produce such an assemblage of remarkable\r\nand perfectly distinct groups of birds; and no less wonderful is its\r\nrichness in species, since these fully equal, if they do not surpass, those\r\nof the {52} two great tropical regions of the Eastern Hemisphere (the\r\nEthiopian and the Oriental) combined.\r\n\r\nAs an additional indication of the distinctness and isolation of the\r\nNeotropical region from all others, and especially from the whole Eastern\r\nHemisphere, we must say something of the otherwise widely distributed\r\ngroups which are absent. Among mammalia we have first the order\r\nInsectivora, entirely absent from South America, though a few species are\r\nfound in Central America and the West Indies; the Viverridae or civet\r\nfamily is wholly wanting, as are every form of sheep, oxen, or antelopes;\r\nwhile the swine, the elephants, and the rhinoceroses of the old world are\r\nrepresented by the diminutive peccaries and tapirs.\r\n\r\nAmong birds we have to notice the absence of tits, true flycatchers,\r\nshrikes, sunbirds, starlings, larks (except a solitary species in the\r\nAndes), rollers, bee-eaters, and pheasants, while warblers are very scarce,\r\nand the almost cosmopolitan wagtails are represented by a single species of\r\npipit.\r\n\r\nWe must also notice the preponderance of low or archaic types among the\r\nanimals of South America. Edentates, marsupials, and rodents form the\r\nmajority of the terrestrial mammalia; while such higher groups as the\r\ncarnivora and hoofed animals are exceedingly deficient. Among birds a low\r\ntype of Passeres, characterised by the absence of the singing muscles, is\r\nexcessively prevalent, the enormous groups of the ant-thrushes, tyrants,\r\ntree-creepers, manakins, and chatterers belonging to it. The Picariae (a\r\nlower group) also prevail to a far greater extent than in any other\r\nregions, both in variety of forms and number of species; and the chief\r\nrepresentatives of the gallinaceous birds--the curassows and tinamous, are\r\nbelieved to be allied, the former to the brush-turkeys of Australia, the\r\nlatter (very remotely) to the ostriches, two of the least developed types\r\nof birds.\r\n\r\nWhether, therefore, we consider its richness in peculiar forms of animal\r\nlife, its enormous variety of species, its numerous deficiencies as\r\ncompared with other parts of the world, or the prevalence of a low type of\r\norganisation among its higher animals, the Neotropical region stands out as\r\nundoubtedly the most remarkable of the great zoological divisions of the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nIn reptiles, amphibia, fresh-water fishes, and insects, {53} this region is\r\nequally peculiar, but we need not refer to these here, our only object now\r\nbeing to establish by a sufficient number of well-known and easily\r\nremembered examples, the distinctness of each region from all others, and\r\nits unity as a whole. The former has now been sufficiently demonstrated,\r\nbut it may be well to say a few words as to the latter point.\r\n\r\nThe only outlying portions of the region about which there can be any doubt\r\nare--Central America, or that part of the region north of the Isthmus of\r\nPanama, the Antilles or West Indian Islands, and the temperate portion of\r\nSouth America including Chili and Patagonia.\r\n\r\nIn Central America, and especially in Mexico, we have an intermixture of\r\nSouth American and North American animals, but the former undoubtedly\r\npredominate, and a large proportion of the peculiar Neotropical groups\r\nextend as far as Costa Rica. Even in Guatemala and Mexico we have howling\r\nand spider-monkeys, coati-mundis, tapirs, and armadillos; while chatterers,\r\nmanakins, ant-thrushes, and other peculiarly Neotropical groups of birds\r\nare abundant. There is therefore no doubt as to Mexico forming part of this\r\nregion, although it is comparatively poor, and exhibits the intermingling\r\nof temperate and tropical forms.\r\n\r\nThe West Indies are less clearly Neotropical, their poverty in mammals as\r\nwell as in most other groups being extreme, while great numbers of North\r\nAmerican birds migrate there in winter. The resident birds, however,\r\ncomprise trogons, sugar-birds, chatterers, with many humming-birds and\r\nparrots, representing eighteen peculiar Neotropical genera; a fact which\r\ndecides the region to which the islands belong.\r\n\r\nSouth temperate America is also very poor as compared with the tropical\r\nparts of the region, and its insects contain a considerable proportion of\r\nnorth temperate forms. But it contains armadillos, cavies and opossums; and\r\nits birds all belong to American groups, though, owing to the inferior\r\nclimate and deficiency of forests, a number of the families of birds\r\npeculiar to tropical America are wanting. Thus there are no manakins,\r\nchatterers, toucans, trogons, or motmots; but there are abundance of\r\nhang-nests, tyrant-birds, ant-thrushes, tree-creepers, and a fair {54}\r\nproportion of humming-birds, tanagers and parrots. The zoology is therefore\r\nthoroughly Neotropical, although somewhat poor; and it has a number of\r\npeculiar forms of strictly Neotropical types--as the chinchillas, alpacas,\r\n&c., which are not found in the tropical regions except in the high Andes.\r\n\r\n_Comparison of Zoological Regions with the Geographical Divisions of the\r\nGlobe._--Having now completed our survey of the great zoological regions of\r\nthe globe, we find that they do not differ so much from the old\r\ngeographical divisions as our first example might have led us to suppose.\r\nEurope, Asia, Africa, Australia, North America, and South America, really\r\ncorrespond, each to a zoological region, but their boundaries require to be\r\nmodified more or less considerably; and if we remember this, and keep their\r\nextensions or limitations always in our mind, we may use the terms \"South\r\nAmerican\" or \"North American,\" as being equivalent to Neotropical and\r\nNearctic, without much inconvenience, while \"African\" and \"Australian\"\r\nequally well serve to express the zoological type of the Ethiopian and\r\nAustralian regions. Europe and Asia require more important modifications.\r\nThe European fauna does indeed well represent the Palaearctic in all its\r\nmain features, and if instead of Asia we say tropical Asia we have the\r\nOriental region very fairly defined; so that the relation of the\r\ngeographical with the zoological primary divisions of the earth is\r\nsufficiently clear. In order to make these relations visible to the eye and\r\nmore easily remembered, we will put them into a tabular form:\r\n\r\n    Regions.

America and W. Indies.\r\n\r\nThe following arrangement of the regions will indicate their geographical\r\nposition, and to a considerable extent their relation to each other.\r\n\r\n  N E A R C T I C--P A L A E A R C T I C\r\n        |              |             |\r\n        |              |          ORIENTAL\r\n        |          ETHIOPIAN         |\r\n      NEO-                           |\r\n    TROPICAL                       AUSTRALIAN\r\n\r\n  May   4th.

In the first\r\nplace, there is evidently this radical difference between the state of Mars\r\nnow and of the Earth during a glacial period--that Mars has no great\r\nice-sheets spreading over its temperate zone, as the Earth undoubtedly had.\r\nThis we know from the fact of the _rapid_ disappearance of the white\r\npatches over a belt three degrees wide in a fortnight (equal to a width of\r\nabout 100 miles of our measure), and in the northern hemisphere of eight\r\ndegrees wide (about 280 miles) between May 4th and July 12th. Even with our\r\nmuch more powerful sun, which gives us more than twice as much heat as Mars\r\nreceives, no such diminution of an ice-sheet, or of glaciers of even\r\nmoderate thickness, could possibly occur; but the phenomenon is on the\r\ncontrary exactly analogous to what actually takes place on the plains of\r\nSiberia in summer. These, as I am informed by Mr. Seebohm, are covered with\r\nsnow during winter and spring to a depth of six or eight feet, which\r\ndiminishes very little even under the hot suns of May, till warm winds\r\ncombine with the sun in June, when in about a fortnight the whole of it\r\ndisappears, and a little later the whole of northern Asia is free from its\r\nwinter covering. As, however, the sun of Mars is so much less powerful than\r\nours, we may be {56} sure that the snow (if it is real snow) is much less\r\nthick--a mere surface-coating in fact, such as occurs in parts of Russia\r\nwhere the precipitation is less, and the snow accordingly does not exceed\r\ntwo or three feet in thickness.\r\n\r\nWe now see the reason why the _southern_ pole of Mars parts with its white\r\ncovering so much more quickly and to so much greater an extent than the\r\n_northern_, for the south pole during summer is nearest the sun, and, owing\r\nto the great excentricity of Mars, would have about one-third more heat\r\nthan during the summer of the northern hemisphere; and this greater heat\r\nwould cause the winds from the equator to be both warmer and more powerful,\r\nand able to produce the same effects on the scanty Martian snows as they\r\nproduce on our northern snow-plains. The reason why both poles of Mars are\r\nalmost equally snow-covered in winter is not difficult to understand. Owing\r\nto the greater obliquity of the ecliptic, and the much greater length of\r\nthe year, the polar regions will be subject to winter darkness fully twice\r\nas long as with us, and the fact that one pole is nearer the sun during\r\nthis period than the other at a corresponding period, will therefore make\r\nno perceptible difference. It is also probable that the two poles of Mars\r\nare approximately alike as regards their geographical features, and that\r\nneither of them is surrounded by very high land on which ice may\r\naccumulate. With us at the present time, on the other hand, geographical\r\nconditions completely mask and even reverse the influence of excentricity,\r\nand that of winter in _perihelion_ in the northern, and summer in\r\n_perihelion_ in the southern, hemisphere. In the north we have a\r\npreponderance of sea within the Arctic circle, and of lowlands in the\r\ntemperate zone. In the south exactly opposite conditions prevail, for there\r\nwe have a preponderance of land (and much of it high land) within the\r\nAntarctic circle, and of sea in the temperate zone. Ice, therefore,\r\naccumulates in the south, while a thin coating of snow, easily melted in\r\nsummer, is the prevalent feature in the north; and these contrasts react\r\nupon climate to such an extent, that in the southern ocean, islands in the\r\nlatitude of Ireland have glaciers descending to the level of the sea, and\r\nconstant snowstorms {57} in the height of summer, although the sun is then\r\nactually nearer the earth than it is during our northern summer!\r\n\r\nIt is evident, therefore, that the phenomena presented by the varying polar\r\nsnows of Mars are in no way opposed to that modification of Dr. Croll's\r\ntheory of the conditions which brought about the glacial epochs of our\r\nnorthern hemisphere, which is here advocated; but are perfectly explicable\r\non the same general principles, if we keep in mind the distinction between\r\nan ice-sheet--which a summer's sun cannot materially diminish, but may even\r\nincrease by bringing vapour to be condensed into snow--and a thin snowy\r\ncovering which may be annually melted and annually renewed, with great\r\nrapidity and over large areas. Except within the small circles of perpetual\r\npolar snow there can at the present time be no ice-sheets in Mars; and the\r\nreason why this permanent snowy area is more extensive around the northern\r\nthan around the southern pole may be partly due to higher land at the\r\nnorth, but is perhaps sufficiently explained by the diminished power of the\r\nsummer sun, owing to its greatly increased distance at that season in the\r\nnorthern hemisphere, so that it is not able to melt so much of the snow\r\nwhich has accumulated during the long night of winter.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{58}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nANCIENT GLACIAL EPOCHS, AND MILD CLIMATES IN THE ARCTIC REGIONS\r\n\r\n    Dr. Croll's Views on Ancient Glacial Epochs--Effects of Denudation in\r\n    Destroying the Evidence of Remote Glacial Epochs--Rise of Sea-level\r\n    Connected with Glacial Epochs a Cause of Further Denudation--What\r\n    Evidence of Early Glacial Epochs may be Expected--Evidences of\r\n    Ice-action During the Tertiary Period--The Weight of the Negative\r\n    Evidence--Temperate Climates in the Arctic Regions--The Miocene Arctic\r\n    Flora--Mild Arctic Climates of the Cretaceous Period--Stratigraphical\r\n    Evidence of Long-continued Mild Arctic Conditions--The Causes of Mild\r\n    Arctic Climates--Geographical Conditions Favouring Mild Northern\r\n    Climates in Tertiary Times--The Indian Ocean as a Source of Heat in\r\n    Tertiary Times--Condition of North America During the Tertiary\r\n    Period--Effect of High Excentricity on Warm Polar Climates--Evidences\r\n    as to Climate in the Secondary and Palaeozoic Epochs--Warm Arctic\r\n    Climates in Early Secondary and Palaeozoic Times--Conclusions as to the\r\n    Climates of Secondary and Tertiary Periods--General View of Geological\r\n    Climates as Dependent on the Physical Features of the Earth's\r\n    Surface--Estimate of the Comparative Effects of Geographical and\r\n    Physical Causes in Producing Changes of Climate.\r\n\r\nIf we adopt the view set forth in the preceding chapter as to the character\r\nof the glacial epoch and of the accompanying alternations of climate, it\r\nmust have been a very important agent in producing changes in the\r\ndistribution of animal and vegetable life. The intervening mild periods,\r\nwhich almost certainly occurred during its earlier and later phases, may\r\nhave been sometimes more equable than even our present insular climate, and\r\nsevere frosts were probably then unknown. During the four or five {59}\r\nthousand years that each specially mild period may have lasted, some\r\nportions of the north temperate zone, which had been buried in snow or ice,\r\nwould become again clothed with vegetation and stocked with animal life,\r\nboth of which, as the cold again came on, would be driven southward, or\r\nperhaps partially exterminated. Forms usually separated would thus be\r\ncrowded together, and a struggle for existence would follow, which must\r\nhave led to the modification or the extinction of many species. When the\r\nsurvivors in the struggle had reached a state of equilibrium, a fresh field\r\nwould be opened to them by the later ameliorations of climate; the more\r\nsuccessful of the survivors would spread and multiply; and after this had\r\ngone on for thousands of generations, another change of climate, another\r\nsouthward migration, another struggle of northern and southern forms would\r\ntake place.\r\n\r\nBut if the last glacial epoch has coincided with, and has been to a\r\nconsiderable extent caused by, a high excentricity of the earth's orbit, we\r\nare naturally led to expect that earlier glacial epochs would have occurred\r\nwhenever the excentricity was unusually large. Dr. Croll has published\r\ntables showing the varying amounts of excentricity for three million years\r\nback; and from these it appears that there have been many periods of high\r\nexcentricity, which has often been far greater than at the time of the last\r\nglacial epoch.[10] The accompanying diagram has been drawn from these\r\ntables, and it will be seen that the highest excentricity occurred 850,000\r\nyears ago, at which time the difference between the sun's distance at\r\n_aphelion_ and _perihelion_ was thirteen and a half millions of miles,\r\nwhereas during the last glacial period the maximum difference was ten and a\r\nhalf million miles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DIAGRAM SHOWING THE CHANGES OF EXCENTRICITY DURING THE LAST\r\nTHREE MILLION YEARS.]\r\n\r\nNow, judging by the amount of organic and physical change that occurred\r\nduring and since the glacial epoch, and that which has occurred since the\r\nMiocene period, it is considered probable that this maximum of excentricity\r\ncoincided with some part of the latter period; and Dr. Croll maintains that\r\na glacial epoch must then have {60} occurred surpassing in severity that of\r\nwhich we have such convincing proofs, and consisting like it of\r\nalternations of cold and warm phases every 10,500 years. The diagram also\r\nshows us another long-continued period of high excentricity from 1,750,000\r\nto 1,950,000 years ago, and yet another almost equal to the maximum\r\n2,500,000 years back. These may perhaps have occurred during the Eocene and\r\nCretaceous epochs respectively, or all may have been included within the\r\nlimits of the Tertiary period. As two of these high excentricities greatly\r\nexceed that which caused our glacial epoch, while the third is almost equal\r\nto it and of longer duration, they seem to afford us the means of testing\r\nrival theories of the causes of glaciation. If, as Dr. Croll argues, high\r\nexcentricity is the great and dominating agency in bringing on glacial\r\nepochs, geographical changes being subordinate, then there must have been\r\nglacial epochs of great severity at all these three periods; while if he is\r\nalso correct in supposing that the alternate phases of precession would\r\ninevitably produce glaciation in one hemisphere, and a proportionately mild\r\nand equable climate in the opposite hemisphere, then we should have to look\r\nfor evidence of exceptionally warm and exceptionally cold periods,\r\noccurring {61} alternately and with several repetitions, within a space of\r\ntime which, geologically speaking, is very short indeed.\r\n\r\nLet us then inquire first into the character of the evidence we should\r\nexpect to find of such changes of climate, if they have occurred; we shall\r\nthen be in a better position to estimate at its proper value the evidence\r\nthat actually exists, and, after giving it due weight, to arrive at some\r\nconclusion as to the theory that best explains and harmonises it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Effects of Denudation in Destroying the Evidence of Remote Glacial\r\nEpochs._--It may be supposed, that if earlier glacial epochs than the last\r\ndid really occur, we ought to meet with some evidence of the fact\r\ncorresponding to that which has satisfied us of the extensive recent\r\nglaciation of the northern hemisphere; but Dr. Croll and other writers have\r\nably argued that no such evidence is likely to be found. It is now\r\ngenerally admitted that sub-aerial denudation is a much more powerful agent\r\nin lowering and modifying the surface of a country than was formerly\r\nsupposed. It has in fact been proved to be so powerful that the difficulty\r\nnow felt is, not to account for the denudation which can be proved to have\r\noccurred, but to explain the apparent persistence of superficial features\r\nwhich ought long ago to have been destroyed.\r\n\r\nA proof of the lowering and eating away of the land-surface which every one\r\ncan understand, is to be found in the quantity of solid matter carried down\r\nto the sea and to low grounds by rivers. This is capable of pretty accurate\r\nmeasurement, and it has been carefully measured for several rivers, large\r\nand small, in different parts of the world. The details of these\r\nmeasurements will be given in a future chapter, and it is only necessary\r\nhere to state that the average of them all gives us this result--that one\r\nfoot must, on an average, be taken off the entire surface of the land each\r\n3,000 years in order to produce the amount of sediment and matter in\r\nsolution which is actually carried into the sea. To give an idea of the\r\nlimits of variation in different rivers it may be mentioned that the\r\nMississippi is one which denudes its valley at a slow rate, taking 6,000\r\n{62} years to remove one foot; while the Po is the most rapid, taking only\r\n729 years to do the same work in its valley. The cause of this difference\r\nis very easy to understand. A large part of the area of the Mississippi\r\nbasin consists of the almost rainless prairie and desert regions of the\r\nwest, while its sources are in comparatively arid mountains with scanty\r\nsnow-fields, or in a low forest-clad plateau. The Po, on the other hand, is\r\nwholly in a district of abundant rainfall, while its sources are spread\r\nover a great amphitheatre of snowy Alps nearly 400 miles in extent, where\r\nthe denuding forces are at a maximum. As Scotland is a mountain region of\r\nrather abundant rainfall, the denuding power of its rains and rivers is\r\nprobably rather above than under the average, but to avoid any possible\r\nexaggeration we will take it at a foot in 4,000 years.\r\n\r\nNow if the end of the glacial epoch be taken to coincide with the\r\ntermination of the last period of high excentricity, which occurred about\r\n80,000 years ago (and no geologist will consider this too long for the\r\nchanges which have since taken place), it follows that the entire surface\r\nof Scotland must have been since lowered an average amount of twenty feet.\r\nBut over large areas of alluvial plains, and wherever the rivers have\r\nspread during floods, the ground will have been raised instead of lowered;\r\nand on all nearly level ground and gentle slopes there will have been\r\ncomparatively little denudation; so that proportionally much more must have\r\nbeen taken away from mountain sides and from the bottoms of valleys having\r\na considerable downward slope. One of the very highest authorities on the\r\nsubject of denudation, Mr. Archibald Geikie, estimates the area of these\r\nmore rapidly denuded portions as only one-tenth of the comparatively level\r\ngrounds, and he further estimates that the former will be denuded about ten\r\ntimes as fast as the latter. It follows that the valleys will be deepened\r\nand widened on the average about five feet in the 4,000 years instead of\r\none foot; and thus many valleys must have been deepened and widened 100\r\nfeet, and some even more, since the glacial epoch, while the more level\r\nportions of the country will have been lowered on the average only about\r\ntwo feet. {63}\r\n\r\nNow Dr. Croll gives us the following account of the present aspect of the\r\nsurface of a large part of the country:--\r\n\r\n\"Go where one will in the lowlands of Scotland and he shall hardly find a\r\nsingle acre whose upper surface bears the marks of being formed by the\r\ndenuding agents now in operation. He will observe everywhere mounds and\r\nhollows which cannot be accounted for by the present agencies at work....\r\nIn regard to the general surface of the country the present agencies may be\r\nsaid to be just beginning to carve a new line of features out of the old\r\nglacially-formed surface. But so little progress has yet been made, that\r\nthe kames, gravel-mounds, knolls of boulder clay, &c., still retain in most\r\ncases their original form.\"[11]\r\n\r\nThe facts here seem a little inconsistent, and we must suppose that Dr.\r\nCroll has somewhat exaggerated the universality and complete preservation\r\nof the glaciated surface. The amount of average denudation, however, is not\r\na matter of opinion but of measurement; and its consequences can in no way\r\nbe evaded. They are, moreover, strictly proportionate to the time elapsed;\r\nand if so much of the old surface of the country has certainly been\r\nremodelled or carried into the sea since the last glacial epoch, it becomes\r\nevident that any surface-phenomena produced by still earlier glacial epochs\r\n_must_ have long since entirely disappeared.\r\n\r\n_Rise of the Sea-level Connected with Glacial Epochs, a Cause of Further\r\nDenudation._--There is also another powerful agent that must have assisted\r\nin the destruction of any such surface deposits or markings. During the\r\nlast glacial epoch itself there were several minor oscillations of the\r\nland, without counting the great submergence of over 1,300 feet, supposed\r\nto be indicated by patches of shelly clays and gravels in Wales and\r\nIreland, and also in a few localities in England and Scotland, since these\r\nare otherwise explained by many geologists. Other subsidences have no doubt\r\noccurred in the same areas during the Tertiary epoch, and some writers\r\nconnect these subsidences with the glacial {64} period itself, the unequal\r\namount of ice at the two poles causing the centre of gravity of the earth\r\nto be displaced when, of course, the surface of the ocean will conform to\r\nit and appear to rise in the one hemisphere and sink in the other. If this\r\nis the case, subsidences of the land are natural concomitants of a glacial\r\nperiod, and will powerfully aid in removing all evidence of its occurrence.\r\nWe have seen reason to believe, however, that during the height of the\r\nglacial epoch the extreme cold persisted through the successive phases of\r\nprecession, and if so, both polar areas would probably be glaciated at\r\nonce. This would cause the abstraction of a large quantity of water from\r\nthe ocean, and a proportionate elevation of the land, which would react on\r\nthe accumulation of snow and ice, and thus add another to that wonderful\r\nseries of physical agents which act and react on each other so as to\r\nintensify glacial epochs.\r\n\r\nBut whether or not these causes would produce any important fluctuations of\r\nthe sea-level is of comparatively little importance to our present inquiry,\r\nbecause the wide extent of marine Tertiary deposits in the northern\r\nhemisphere and their occurrence at considerable elevations above the\r\npresent sea-level, afford the most conclusive proofs that great changes of\r\nsea and land have occurred throughout the entire Tertiary period; and these\r\nrepeated submergences and emergences of the land combined with sub-aerial\r\nand marine denudation, would undoubtedly destroy all those superficial\r\nevidences of ice-action on which we mainly depend for proofs of the\r\noccurrence of the last glacial epoch.\r\n\r\n_What Evidence of Early Glacial Epochs may be Expected._--Although we may\r\nadmit the force of the preceding argument as to the extreme improbability\r\nof our finding any clear evidence of the superficial action of ice during\r\nremote glacial epochs, there is nevertheless one kind of evidence that we\r\nought to find, because it is both wide-spread and practically\r\nindestructible.\r\n\r\nOne of the most constant of all the phenomena of a glaciated country is the\r\nabundance of icebergs produced by the breaking off of the ends of glaciers\r\nwhich terminate {65} in arms of the sea, or of the terminal face of the\r\nice-sheet which passes beyond the land into the ocean. In both these cases\r\nabundance of rocks and _debris_, such as form the terminal moraines of\r\nglaciers on land, are carried out to sea and deposited over the sea-bottom\r\nof the area occupied by icebergs. In the case of an ice-sheet it is almost\r\ncertain that much of the ground-moraine, consisting of mud and imbedded\r\nstones, similar to that which forms the \"till\" when deposited on land, will\r\nbe carried out to sea with the ice and form a deposit of marine \"till\" near\r\nthe shore.\r\n\r\nIt has indeed been objected that when an ice-sheet covered an entire\r\ncountry there would be no moraines, and that rocks or _debris_ are very\r\nrarely seen on icebergs. But during every glacial epoch there will be a\r\nsouthern limit to the glaciated area, and everywhere near this limit the\r\nmountain-tops will rise far above the ice and deposit on it great masses of\r\n_debris_; and as the ice-sheet spreads, and again as it passes away, this\r\nmoraine-forming area will successively occupy the whole country. But even\r\nsuch an ice-clad country as Greenland is now known to have protruding peaks\r\nand rocky masses which give rise to moraines on its surface;[12] and, as\r\nrocks from Cumberland and Ireland were carried by the ice-sheet to the Isle\r\nof Man, there must have been a very long period during which the ice-sheets\r\nof Britain and Ireland terminated in the ocean and sent off abundance of\r\nrock-laden bergs into the surrounding seas; and the same thing must have\r\noccurred along all the coasts of Northern Europe and Eastern America.\r\n\r\nWe cannot therefore doubt that throughout the greater part of the duration\r\nof a glacial epoch the seas adjacent to the glaciated countries would\r\nreceive continual deposits of large rocks, rock-fragments, and gravel,\r\nsimilar to the material of modern and ancient moraines, and analogous to\r\nthe drift and the numerous travelled blocks which the ice has undoubtedly\r\nscattered broadcast over every glaciated country; and these rocks and\r\nboulders would be imbedded in whatever deposits were then forming, either\r\nfrom the matter carried down by rivers or from the mud ground off {66} the\r\nrocks and carried out to sea by the glaciers themselves. Moreover, as\r\nicebergs float far beyond the limits of the countries which gave them\r\nbirth, these ice-borne materials would be largely imbedded in deposits\r\nforming from the denudation of countries which had never been glaciated, or\r\nfrom which the ice had already disappeared.\r\n\r\nBut if every period of high excentricity produced a glacial epoch of\r\ngreater or less extent and severity, then, on account of the frequent\r\noccurrence of a high phase of excentricity during the three million years\r\nfor which we have the tables, these boulder and rock-strewn deposits would\r\nbe both numerous and extensive. Four hundred thousand years ago the\r\nexcentricity was almost exactly the same as it is now, and it continually\r\nincreased from that time up to the glacial epoch. Now if we take double the\r\npresent excentricity as being sufficient to produce some glaciation in the\r\ntemperate zone, we find (by drawing out the diagram at p. 171 on a larger\r\nscale) that during 1,150,000 years out of the 2,400,000 years immediately\r\npreceding the last glacial epoch, the excentricity reached or exceeded this\r\namount, consisting of sixteen separate epochs, divided from each other by\r\nperiods varying from 30,000 to 200,000 years. But if the last glacial epoch\r\nwas at its maximum 200,000 years ago, a space of three million years will\r\ncertainly include much, if not all, of the Tertiary period; and even if it\r\ndoes not, we have no reason to suppose that the character of the\r\nexcentricity would suddenly change beyond the three million years.\r\n\r\nIt follows, therefore, that if periods of high excentricity, like that\r\nwhich appears to have been synchronous with our last glacial epoch and is\r\ngenerally admitted to have been one of its efficient causes, always\r\nproduced glacial epochs (with or without alternating warm periods), then\r\nthe whole of the Tertiary deposits in the north temperate and Arctic zones\r\nshould exhibit frequent alternations of boulder and rock-bearing beds, or\r\ncoarse rock-strewn gravels analogous to our existing glacial drift, and\r\nwith some corresponding change of organic remains. Let us then see what\r\nevidence can be adduced of the existence of such deposits, and whether it\r\nis adequate to support the {67} theory of repeated glacial epochs during\r\nthe Tertiary period.\r\n\r\n_Evidences of Ice-action during the Tertiary Period._--The Tertiary fossils\r\nboth of Europe and North America indicate throughout warm or temperate\r\nclimates, except those of the more recent Pliocene deposits which merge\r\ninto the earlier glacial beds. The Miocene deposits of Central and Southern\r\nEurope, for example, contain marine shells of some genera now only found\r\nfarther south, while the fossil plants often resemble those of Madeira and\r\nthe southern states of North America. Large reptiles, too, abounded, and\r\nman-like apes lived in the south of France and in Germany. Yet in Northern\r\nItaly, near Turin, there are beds of sandstone and conglomerate full of\r\ncharacteristic Miocene shells, but containing in an intercalated deposit\r\nangular blocks of serpentine and greenstone often of enormous size, one\r\nbeing fourteen feet long, and another twenty-six feet. Some of the blocks\r\nwere observed by Sir Charles Lyell to be faintly striated and partly\r\npolished on one side, and they are scattered through the beds for a\r\nthickness of nearly 150 feet. It is interesting that the particular bed in\r\nwhich the blocks occur yields no organic remains, though these are\r\nplentiful both in the underlying and overlying beds, as if the cold of the\r\nicebergs, combined with the turbidity produced by the glacial mud, had\r\ndriven away the organisms adapted to live only in a comparatively warm sea.\r\nRock similar in kind to these erratics occurs about twenty miles distant in\r\nthe Alps.\r\n\r\nThe Eocene period is even more characteristically tropical in its flora and\r\nfauna, since palms and Cycadaceae, turtles, snakes, and crocodiles then\r\ninhabited England. Yet on the north side of the Alps, extending from\r\nSwitzerland to Vienna, and also south of the Alps near Genoa, there is a\r\ndeposit of finely-stratified sandstone several thousand feet in thickness,\r\nquite destitute of organic remains, but containing in several places in\r\nSwitzerland enormous blocks either angular or partly rounded, and composed\r\nof oolitic limestone or of granite. Near the Lake of Thun some of the\r\ngranite blocks found in this deposit are of enormous size, one of them\r\nbeing 105 feet long, ninety feet wide, {68} and forty-five feet thick! The\r\ngranite is red, and of a peculiar kind which cannot be matched anywhere in\r\nthe Alps, or indeed elsewhere. Similar erratics have also been found in\r\nbeds of the same age in the Carpathians and in the Apennines, indicating\r\nprobably an extensive inland European sea into which glaciers descended\r\nfrom the surrounding mountains, depositing these erratics, and cooling the\r\nwater so as to destroy the mollusca and other organisms which had\r\npreviously inhabited it. It is to be observed that wherever these erratics\r\noccur they are always in the vicinity of great mountain ranges; and\r\nalthough these can be proved to have been in great part elevated during the\r\nTertiary period, we must also remember that they must have been since very\r\nmuch lowered by denudation, of the amount of which, the enormously thick\r\nEocene and Miocene beds now forming portions of them is in some degree a\r\nmeasure as well as a proof. It is not therefore at all improbable that\r\nduring some part of the Tertiary period these mountains may have been far\r\nhigher than they are now, and this we know might be sufficient for the\r\nproduction of glaciers descending to the sea-level, even were the climate\r\nof the lowlands somewhat warmer than at present.[13]\r\n\r\n_The Weight of the Negative Evidence._--But when we proceed to examine the\r\nTertiary deposits of other parts of {69} Europe, and especially of our own\r\ncountry, for evidence of this kind, not only is such evidence completely\r\nwanting, but the facts are of so definite a character as to satisfy most\r\ngeologists that it can never have existed; and the same maybe said of\r\ntemperate North America and of the Arctic regions generally.\r\n\r\nIn his carefully written paper on \"The Climate Controversy\" the late Mr.\r\nSearles V. Wood, Jun., remarks on this point as follows: \"Now the Eocene\r\nformation is complete in England, and is exposed in continuous section\r\nalong the north coast of the Isle of Wight from its base to its junction\r\nwith the Oligocene (or Lower Miocene according to some), and along the\r\nnorthern coast of Kent from its base to the Lower Bagshot Sand. It has been\r\nintersected by railway and other cuttings in all directions and at all\r\nhorizons, and pierced by wells innumerable; while from its strata in\r\nEngland, France, and Belgium, the most extensive collections of organic\r\nremains have been made of any formation yet explored, and from nearly all\r\nits horizons, for at one place or another in these three countries nearly\r\nevery horizon may be said to have yielded fossils of some kind. These\r\nfossils, however, whether they be the remains of a flora such as that of\r\nSheppey, or of a vertebrate fauna containing the crocodile and alligator,\r\nsuch as is yielded by beds indicative of terrestrial conditions, or of a\r\nmolluscan assemblage such as is present in marine or fluvio-marine beds of\r\nthe formation, are of unmistakably tropical or sub-tropical character\r\nthroughout; and no trace whatever has appeared of the intercalation of a\r\nglacial period, much less of successive intercalations indicative of more\r\nthan one period of 10,500 years' glaciation. Nor can it be urged that the\r\nglacial epochs of the Eocene in England were intervals of dry land, and so\r\nhave left no evidence of their existence behind them, because a large part\r\nof the continuous sequence of Eocene deposits in this country consists of\r\nalternations of fluviatile, fluvio-marine, and purely marine strata; so\r\nthat it seems impossible that during the accumulation of the Eocene\r\nformation in England a glacial period could have occurred without its\r\nevidences being {70} abundantly apparent. The Oligocene of Northern Germany\r\nand Belgium, and the Miocene of those countries and of France, have also\r\nafforded a rich molluscan fauna, which, like that of the Eocene, has as yet\r\npresented no indication of the intrusion of anything to interfere with its\r\nuniformly sub-tropical character.\"[14]\r\n\r\nThis is sufficiently striking; but when we consider that this enormous\r\nseries of deposits, many thousand feet in thickness, consists wholly of\r\nalternations of clays, sands, marls, shales, or limestones, with a few beds\r\nof pebbles or conglomerate, not one of the whole series containing\r\nirregular blocks of foreign material, boulders or gravel, such as we have\r\nseen to be the essential characteristic of a glacial epoch; and when we\r\nfind that this same general character pervades all the extensive Tertiary\r\ndeposits of temperate North America, we shall, I think, be forced to the\r\nconclusion that no general glacial epochs could have occurred during their\r\nformation. It must be remembered that the \"imperfection of the geological\r\nrecord\" will not help us here, because the series of Tertiary deposits is\r\nunusually complete, and we must suppose some destructive agency to have\r\nselected all the intercalated glacial beds and to have so completely made\r\naway with them that not a fragment remains, while preserving all or almost\r\nall the _interglacial_ beds; and to have acted thus capriciously, not in\r\none limited area only, but over the whole northern hemisphere, with the\r\nlocal exceptions on the flanks of great mountain ranges already referred\r\nto.\r\n\r\n_Temperate Climates in the Arctic Regions._--As we have just seen, the\r\ngeological evidence of the persistence of sub-tropical or warm climates in\r\nthe north temperate zone during the greater part of the Tertiary period is\r\nalmost irresistible, and we have now to consider the still more\r\nextraordinary series of observations which demonstrate that this\r\namelioration of climate extended into the Arctic zone, and into countries\r\nnow almost wholly buried in snow and ice. These warm Arctic climates have\r\nbeen explained by Dr. Croll as due to periods of high excentricity with\r\nwinter in _perihelion_, a theory which implies alternating {71} epochs of\r\nglaciation far exceeding what now prevails; and it is therefore necessary\r\nto examine the evidence pretty closely in order to see if this view is more\r\ntenable in the case of the north polar regions than we have found it to be\r\nin that of the north temperate zone.\r\n\r\nThe most recent of these milder climates is perhaps indicated by the\r\nabundant remains of large mammalia--such as the mammoth, woolly rhinoceros,\r\nbison and horse, in the icy alluvial plains of Northern Siberia, and\r\nespecially in the Liakhov Islands in the same latitude as the North Cape of\r\nAsia. These remains occur not in one or two spots only, as if collected by\r\neddies at the mouth of a river, but along the whole borders of the Arctic\r\nOcean; and it is generally admitted that the animals must have lived upon\r\nthe adjacent plains, and that a considerably milder climate than now\r\nprevails could alone have enabled them to do so. How long ago this occurred\r\nwe do not know, but one of the last intercalated mild periods of the\r\nglacial epoch itself seems to offer all the necessary conditions. Again,\r\nSir Edward Belcher discovered on the dreary shores of Wellington Channel in\r\n75-1/2deg N. Lat. the trunk and root of a fir tree which had evidently\r\ngrown where it was found. It appeared to belong to the species _Abies\r\nalba_, or white fir, which now reaches 68deg N. Lat. and is the most\r\nnortherly conifer known. Similar trees, one four feet in circumference and\r\nthirty feet long, were found by Lieut. Mecham in Prince Patrick's Island in\r\nLat. 76deg 12' N., and other Arctic explorers have found remains of trees\r\nin high latitudes.[15]\r\n\r\nSimilar indications of a recent milder climate are found in Spitzbergen.\r\nProfessor Nordenskjoeld says: \"At various places on Spitzbergen, at the\r\nbottom of Lomme Bay, at Cape Thordsen, in Blomstrand's strata in Advent\r\nBay, there are found large and well-developed shells of a bivalve, _Mytilus\r\nedulis_, which is not now found living on the coast of Spitzbergen, though\r\non the west coast of Scandinavia it everywhere covers the rocks near the\r\nsea-shore. These shells occur most plentifully in the bed of a river which\r\nruns through Reindeer Valley at Cape Thordsen. They {72} are probably\r\nwashed out of a thin bed of sand at a height of about twenty or thirty feet\r\nabove the present sea-level, which is intersected by the river. The\r\ngeological age of this bed cannot be very great, and it has clearly been\r\nformed since the present basin of the Ice Sound, or at least the greater\r\npart of it, has been hollowed out by glacial action.\"[16]\r\n\r\n_The Miocene Arctic Flora._--One of the most startling and important of the\r\nscientific discoveries of the last forty years has been that of the relics\r\nof a luxuriant Miocene flora in various parts of the Arctic regions. It is\r\na discovery that was totally unexpected, and is even now considered by many\r\nmen of science to be completely unintelligible; but it is so thoroughly\r\nestablished, and it has such a direct and important bearing on the subjects\r\nwe are discussing in the present volume, that it is necessary to lay a\r\ntolerably complete outline of the facts before our readers.\r\n\r\nThe Miocene flora of temperate Europe was very like that of Eastern Asia,\r\nJapan, and the warmer part of Eastern North America of the present day. It\r\nis very richly represented in Switzerland by well preserved fossil remains,\r\nand after a close comparison with the flora of other countries Professor\r\nHeer concludes that the Swiss Lower Miocene flora indicates a climate\r\ncorresponding to that of Louisiana, North Africa, and South China, while\r\nthe Upper Miocene climate of the same country would correspond to that of\r\nthe south of Spain, Southern Japan, and Georgia (U.S. of America). Of this\r\nlatter flora, found chiefly at Oeninghen in the northern extremity of\r\nSwitzerland, 465 species are known, of which 166 species are trees or\r\nshrubs, half of them being evergreens. They comprise sequoias like the\r\nCalifornian giant trees, camphor-trees, cinnamons, sassafras, bignonias,\r\ncassias, gleditschias, tulip-trees, and many other American genera,\r\ntogether with maples, ashes, planes, oaks, poplars, and other familiar\r\nEuropean trees represented by a variety of extinct species. If we now go to\r\nthe west coast of Greenland in 70deg N. Lat. we find abundant remains of a\r\nflora of the same general {73} type as that of Oeninghen but of a more\r\nnorthern character. We have a sequoia identical with one of the species\r\nfound at Oeninghen, a chestnut, salisburia, liquidambar, sassafras, and\r\neven a magnolia. We have also seven species of oaks, two planes, two vines,\r\nthree beeches, four poplars, two willows, a walnut, a plum, and several\r\nshrubs supposed to be evergreens; altogether 137 species, mostly well and\r\nabundantly preserved!\r\n\r\nBut even further north, in Spitzbergen, in 78deg and 79deg N. Lat. and one\r\nof the most barren and inhospitable regions on the globe, an almost equally\r\nrich fossil flora has been discovered including several of the Greenland\r\nspecies, and others peculiar, but mostly of the same genera. There seem to\r\nbe no evergreens here except coniferae, one of which is identical with the\r\nswamp-cypress (_Taxodium distichum_) now found living in the Southern\r\nUnited States! There are also eleven pines, two Libocedrus, two sequoias,\r\nwith oaks, poplars, birches, planes, limes, a hazel, an ash, and a walnut;\r\nalso water-lilies, pond-weeds, and an iris--altogether about a hundred\r\nspecies of flowering plants. Even in Grinnell Land, within 8-1/4 degrees of\r\nthe pole, a similar flora existed, twenty-five species of fossil plants\r\nhaving been collected by the last Arctic expedition, of which eighteen were\r\nidentical with the species from other Arctic localities. This flora\r\ncomprised poplars, birches, hazels, elms, viburnums, and eight species of\r\nconifers including the swamp cypress and the Norway spruce (_Pinus abies_)\r\nwhich last does not now extend beyond 69-1/2deg N.\r\n\r\nFossil plants closely resembling those just mentioned have been found at\r\nmany other Arctic localities, especially in Iceland, on the Mackenzie River\r\nin 65deg N. Lat. and in Alaska. As an intermediate station we have, in the\r\nneighbourhood of Dantzic in Lat. 55deg N., a similar flora, with the\r\nswamp-cypress, sequoias, oaks, poplars, and some cinnamons, laurels, and\r\nfigs. A little further south, near Breslau, north of the Carpathians, a\r\nrich flora has been found allied to that of Oeninghen, but wanting in some\r\nof the more tropical forms. Again, in the Isle of Mull in Scotland, in\r\nabout 56-1/2deg N. Lat., a plant-bed has been discovered {74} containing a\r\nhazel, a plane, and a sequoia, apparently identical with a Swiss Miocene\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nWe thus find one well-marked type of vegetation spread from Switzerland and\r\nVienna to North Germany, Scotland, Iceland, Greenland, Alaska, and\r\nSpitzbergen, some few of the species even ranging over the extremes of\r\nlatitude between Oeninghen and Spitzbergen, but the great majority being\r\ndistinct, and exhibiting decided indications of a decrease of temperature\r\naccording to latitude, though much less in amount than now exists. Some\r\nwriters have thought that the great similarity of the floras of Greenland\r\nand Oeninghen is a proof that they were not contemporaneous, but\r\nsuccessive; and that of Greenland has been supposed to be as old as the\r\nEocene. But the arguments yet adduced do not seem to prove such a\r\ndifference of age, because there is only that amount of specific and\r\ngeneric diversity between the two which might be produced by distance and\r\ndifference of temperature, under the exceptionally equable climate of the\r\nperiod. We have even now examples of an equally wide range of well-marked\r\ntypes; as in temperate South America, where many of the genera and some of\r\nthe species range from the Straits of Magellan to Valparaiso--places\r\ndiffering as much in latitude as Switzerland and West Greenland; and the\r\nsame may be said of North Australia and Tasmania, where, at a greater\r\nlatitudinal distance apart, closely allied forms of Eucalyptus, Acacia,\r\nCasuarina, Stylidium, Goodenia, and many other genera would certainly form\r\na prominent feature in any fossil flora now being preserved.\r\n\r\n_Mild Arctic Climates of the Cretaceous Period._--In the Upper Cretaceous\r\ndeposits of Greenland (in a locality not far from those of the Miocene age\r\nlast described) another remarkable flora has been discovered, agreeing\r\ngenerally with that of Europe and North America of the same geological age.\r\nSixty-five species of plants have been identified, of which there are\r\nfifteen ferns, two cycads, eleven coniferae, three monocotyledons, and\r\nthirty-four dicotyledons. One of the ferns is a tree-fern with thick stems,\r\nwhich has also been found in the Upper Greensand of England. Among the\r\nconifers the giant sequoias are found, and among {75} the dicotyledons the\r\ngenera Populus, Myrica, Ficus, Sassafras, Andromeda, Diospyros, Myrsine,\r\nPanax, as well as magnolias, myrtles, and leguminosae. Several of these\r\ngroups occur also in the much richer deposits of the same age in North\r\nAmerica and Central Europe; but all of them evidently afford such\r\nfragmentary records of the actual flora of the period, that it is\r\nimpossible to say that any genus found in one locality was absent from the\r\nother merely because it has not yet been found there. On the whole, there\r\nseems to be less difference between the floras of Arctic and temperate\r\nlatitudes in Upper Cretaceous than in Miocene times.\r\n\r\nIn the same locality in Greenland (70deg 33' N. Lat. and 52deg W. Long.),\r\nand also in Spitzbergen, a more ancient flora, of Lower Cretaceous age, has\r\nbeen found; but it differs widely from the other in the great abundance of\r\ncycads and conifers and the scarcity of exogens, which latter are\r\nrepresented by a single poplar. Of the thirty-eight ferns, fifteen belong\r\nto the genus Gleichenia now almost entirely tropical. There are four genera\r\nof cycads, and three extinct genera of conifers, besides Glyptostrobus and\r\nTorreya now found only in China and California, six species of true pines,\r\nand five of the genus Sequoia, one of which occurs also in Spitzbergen. The\r\nEuropean deposits of the same age closely agree with these in their general\r\ncharacter, conifers, cycads, and ferns forming the mass of the vegetation,\r\nwhile exogens are entirely absent, the above-named Greenland poplar being\r\nthe oldest known dicotyledonous plant.[17]\r\n\r\nIf we take these facts as really representing the flora of the period, we\r\nshall be forced to conclude that, measured by the change effected in its\r\nplants, the lapse of time between the Lower and Upper Cretaceous deposits\r\nwas far greater than between the Upper Cretaceous and the Miocene--a\r\nconclusion quite opposed to the indications afforded by the mollusca and\r\nthe higher animals of the two periods. It seems probable, therefore, that\r\nthese Lower Cretaceous plants represent local peculiarities of {76}\r\nvegetation such as now sometimes occur in tropical countries. On sandy or\r\ncoralline islands in the Malay Archipelago there will often be found a\r\nvegetation consisting almost wholly of cycads, pandani, and palms, while a\r\nfew miles off, on moderately elevated land, not a single specimen of either\r\nof these families may be seen, but a dense forest of dicotyledonous trees\r\ncovering the whole country. A lowland vegetation, such as that above\r\ndescribed, might be destroyed and its remains preserved by a slight\r\ndepression, allowing it to be covered up by the detritus of some adjacent\r\nriver, while not only would the subsidence of high land be a less frequent\r\noccurrence, but when it did occur the steep banks would be undermined by\r\nthe waves, and the trees falling down would be floated away, and would\r\neither be cast on some distant shore or slowly decay on the surface or in\r\nthe depths of the ocean.\r\n\r\nFrom the remarkable series of facts now briefly summarized, we learn, that\r\nwhenever plant-remains have been discovered within the Arctic regions,\r\neither in Tertiary or Cretaceous deposits, they show that the climate was\r\none capable of supporting a rich vegetation of trees, shrubs, and\r\nherbaceous plants, similar in general character to that which prevailed in\r\nthe temperate zone at the same periods, but showing the influence of a less\r\ncongenial climate. These deposits belong to at least four distinct\r\ngeological horizons, and have been found widely scattered within the Arctic\r\ncircle, yet nowhere has any proof been obtained of intercalated cold\r\nperiods, such as would be indicated by the remains of a stunted vegetation,\r\nor a molluscan fauna similar to that which now prevails there.\r\n\r\n_Stratigraphical Evidence of Long-Continued Mild Arctic Conditions._--Let\r\nus now turn to the stratigraphical evidence, which, as we have already\r\nshown, offers a crucial test of the occurrence or non-occurrence of\r\nglaciation during any extensive geological period; and here we have the\r\ntestimony of perhaps the greatest living authority on Arctic\r\ngeology--Professor Nordenskjoeld. In his lecture on \"The Former Climate of\r\nthe Polar Regions,\" he says: \"The character of the coasts in the Arctic\r\nregions is especially favourable to geological investigations. While the\r\nvalleys are for the {77} most part filled with ice, the sides of the\r\nmountains in summer, even in the 80th degree of latitude, and to a height\r\nof 1,000 or 1,500 feet above the level of the sea, are almost wholly free\r\nfrom snow. Nor are the rocks covered with any amount of vegetation worth\r\nmentioning; and, moreover, the sides of the mountains on the shore itself\r\nfrequently present perpendicular sections, which everywhere expose their\r\nbare surfaces to the investigator. The knowledge of a mountain's geognostic\r\ncharacter, at which one, in the more southerly countries, can only arrive\r\nafter long and laborious researches, removal of soil and the like, is here\r\ngained almost at the first glance; and as we have never seen in Spitzbergen\r\nnor in Greenland, in these sections often many miles in length, and\r\nincluding one may say all formations from the Silurian to the Tertiary, any\r\nboulders even as large as a child's head, there is not the smallest\r\nprobability that strata of any considerable extent, containing boulders,\r\nare to be found in the polar tracts previous to the middle of the Tertiary\r\nperiod. Since, then, both an examination of the geognostic condition, and\r\nan investigation of the fossil flora and fauna of the polar lands, show no\r\nsigns of a glacial era having existed in those parts before the termination\r\nof the Miocene period, we are fully justified in rejecting, on the evidence\r\nof actual observation, the hypotheses founded on purely theoretical\r\nspeculations, which assume the many times repeated alternation of warm and\r\nglacial climates between the present time and the earliest geological\r\nages.\"[18] And again, in his _Sketch of the Geology of Spitzbergen_, after\r\ndescribing the various formations down to the Miocene, he says: \"All the\r\nfossils found in the foregoing strata show that Spitzbergen, during former\r\ngeological ages, enjoyed a magnificent climate, which indeed was somewhat\r\ncolder during the Miocene period, but was still favourable for an\r\nextraordinarily abundant vegetation, much more luxuriant than that which\r\nnow occurs even in the southern part of Scandinavia: and I have in those\r\nstrata sought in vain for any sign, that, as some geologists have of late\r\nendeavoured to render probable, these favourable climatic conditions have\r\nbeen broken off {78} by intervals of ancient glacial periods. The profiles\r\nI have had the opportunity to examine during my various Spitzbergen\r\nexpeditions would certainly, if laid down on a line, occupy an extent of _a\r\nthousand English miles_; and if any former glacial period had existed in\r\nthis region, there ought to have been some trace to be observed of erratic\r\nblocks, or other formations which distinguish glacial action. But this has\r\nnot been the case. In the strata, whose length I have reckoned alone, I\r\nhave not found a single fragment of a foreign rock so large as a child's\r\nhead.\"[19]\r\n\r\nNow it is quite impossible to ignore or evade the force of this testimony\r\nas to the continuous warm climates of the north temperate and polar zones\r\nthroughout Tertiary times. The evidence extends over a vast area, both in\r\nspace and time, it is derived from the work of the most competent living\r\ngeologists, and it is absolutely consistent in its general tendency. We\r\nhave in the Lower Cretaceous period an almost tropical climate in France\r\nand England, a somewhat lower temperature in the United States, and a mild\r\ninsular climate in the Arctic regions. In each successive period the\r\nclimate becomes somewhat less tropical; but down to the Upper Miocene it\r\nremains warm temperate in Central Europe, and cold temperate within the\r\npolar area, with not a trace of any intervening periods of Arctic cold. It\r\nthen gradually cools down and merges through the Pliocene into the glacial\r\nepoch in Europe, while in the Arctic zone there is a break in the record\r\nbetween the Miocene and the recent glacial deposits.[20]\r\n\r\n{79}\r\n\r\nAccepting this as a substantially correct account of the general climatic\r\naspect of the Tertiary period in the northern hemisphere, let us see\r\nwhether the principles we have already laid down will enable us to give a\r\nsatisfactory explanation of its causes.\r\n\r\n_The Causes of mild Arctic Climates._--In his remarkable series of papers\r\non \"Ocean Currents,\" the late Dr. James Croll has proved, with a wealth of\r\nargument and illustration whose cogency is irresistible, that the very\r\nhabitability of our globe is due to the equalizing climatic effects of the\r\nwaters of the ocean; and that it is to the same cause that we owe, either\r\ndirectly or indirectly, almost all the chief diversities of climate between\r\nplaces situated in the same latitude. Owing to the peculiar distribution of\r\nland and sea upon the globe, more than its fair proportion of the warm\r\nequatorial waters is directed towards the western shores of Europe, the\r\nresult being that the British Isles, Norway, and Spitzbergen, have all a\r\nmilder climate than any other parts of the globe in corresponding\r\nlatitudes. A very small portion of the Arctic regions, however, obtains\r\nthis benefit, and it thus remains, generally speaking, a land of snow and\r\nice, with too short a summer to nourish more than a very scanty and\r\nfugitive vegetation. The only other opening than that between Iceland and\r\nBritain by which warm water penetrates within the Arctic circle, is through\r\nBehring's Straits; but this is both shallow and limited in width, and the\r\nconsequence is that the larger part of the warm currents of the Pacific\r\nturns back along the shores of the Aleutian Islands and North-west America,\r\nwhile a very small quantity enters the icy ocean.\r\n\r\nBut if there were other and wider openings into the Arctic Ocean, a vast\r\nquantity of the heated water which is now turned backward would enter it,\r\nand would produce an amelioration of the climate of which we can hardly\r\nform a conception. A great amelioration of climate would also be caused by\r\nthe breaking up or the lowering of such {80} Arctic highlands as now favour\r\nthe accumulation of ice; while the interpenetration of the sea into any\r\npart of the great continents in the tropical or temperate zones would again\r\ntend to raise the winter temperature, and render any long continuance of\r\nsnow in their vicinity almost impossible.\r\n\r\nNow geologists have proved, quite independently of any such questions as we\r\nare here discussing, that changes of the very kinds above referred to have\r\noccurred during the Tertiary period; and that there has been, speaking\r\nbroadly, a steady change from a comparatively fragmentary and insular\r\ncondition of the great north temperate lands in early Tertiary times, to\r\nthat more compact and continental condition which now prevails. It is, no\r\ndoubt, difficult and often impossible to determine how long any particular\r\ngeographical condition lasted, or whether the changes in one country were\r\nexactly coincident with those in another; but it will be sufficient for our\r\npurpose briefly to indicate those more important changes of land and sea\r\nduring the Tertiary period, which must have produced a decided effect on\r\nthe climate of the northern hemisphere.\r\n\r\n_Geographical Changes Favouring Mild Northern Climates in Tertiary\r\nTimes._--The distribution of the Eocene and Miocene formations shows, that\r\nduring a considerable portion of the Tertiary period, an inland sea, more\r\nor less occupied by an archipelago of islands, extended across Central\r\nEurope between the Baltic and the Black and Caspian Seas, and thence by\r\nnarrower channels south-eastward to the valley of the Euphrates and the\r\nPersian Gulf, thus opening a communication between the North Atlantic and\r\nthe Indian Oceans. From the Caspian also a wide arm of the sea extended\r\nduring some part of the Tertiary epoch northwards to the Arctic Ocean, and\r\nthere is nothing to show that this sea may not have been in existence\r\nduring the whole Tertiary period. Another channel probably existed over\r\nEgypt[21] into the eastern {81} basin of the Mediterranean and the Black\r\nSea; while it is probable that there was a communication between the Baltic\r\nand the White Sea, leaving Scandinavia as an extensive island. Turning to\r\nIndia, we find that an arm of the sea of great width and depth extended\r\nfrom the Bay of Bengal to the mouths of the Indus; while the enormous\r\ndepression indicated by the presence of marine fossils of Eocene age at a\r\nheight of 10,500 feet in Western Tibet, renders it not improbable that a\r\nmore direct channel across Afghanistan may have opened a communication\r\nbetween the West Asiatic and Polar seas.\r\n\r\nIt may be said that the changes here indicated are not warranted by an\r\nactual knowledge of continuous Tertiary deposits over the situations of the\r\nalleged marine channels; but it is no less certain that the seas in which\r\nany particular strata were deposited were _always_ more extensive than the\r\nfragments of those strata now existing, and _often_ immensely more\r\nextensive. The Eocene deposits of Europe, for example, have certainly\r\nundergone enormous denudation both marine and subaerial, and may have once\r\ncovered areas where we now find older deposits (as the chalk once covered\r\nthe weald), while a portion of them may lie concealed under Miocene,\r\nPliocene, or recent beds. We find them widely scattered over Europe and\r\nAsia, and often elevated into lofty mountain ranges; and we should\r\ncertainly err far more seriously in confining the Eocene seas to the exact\r\nareas where we now find Eocene rocks, than in liberally extending them, so\r\nas to connect the several detached portions of the formation whenever there\r\nis no valid argument against our doing so. Considering then, that some one\r\nor more of the sea-communications here indicated almost certainly existed\r\nduring Eocene and Miocene times, let us endeavour to estimate the probable\r\neffect such communications would have upon the climate of the northern\r\nhemisphere.\r\n\r\n_The Indian Ocean as a Source of Heat in Tertiary Times._--If we compare\r\nthe Indian Ocean with the South Atlantic we shall see that the position and\r\noutline of the former are very favourable for the accumulation of a large\r\nbody of warm water moving northwards. Its southern {82} opening between\r\nSouth Africa and Australia is very wide, and the tendency of the\r\ntrade-winds would be to concentrate the currents towards its north-western\r\nextremity, just where the two great channels above described formed an\r\noutlet to the northern seas. As will be shown in our nineteenth chapter,\r\nthere was probably, during the earlier portion of the Tertiary period at\r\nleast, several large islands in the space between Madagascar and South\r\nIndia; but these had wide and deep channels between them, and their\r\nexistence may have been favourable to the conveyance of heated water\r\nnorthward, by concentrating the currents, and thus producing massive bodies\r\nof moving water analogous to the Gulf Stream of the Atlantic.[22] Less heat\r\nwould thus be lost by evaporation and radiation in the tropical zone, and\r\nan impulse would be acquired which would carry the warm water into the\r\nnorth polar area. About the same period Australia was probably divided into\r\ntwo islands, separated by a wide channel in a north and south direction\r\n(see Chapter XXII.), and through this another current would almost\r\ncertainly set northwards, and be directed to the north-west by the southern\r\nextension of Malayan Asia. The more insular condition at this period of\r\nAustralia, India, and North Africa, with the depression and probable\r\nfertility of the Central Asiatic plateau, would lead to the Indian Ocean\r\nbeing traversed by regular trade-winds instead of by variable monsoons, and\r\nthus the constant _vis a tergo_, which is so efficient in the Atlantic,\r\nwould keep up a steady and powerful current towards the northern parts of\r\nthe Indian Ocean, and thence through the midst of the European archipelago\r\nto the northern seas.\r\n\r\nNow it is quite certain that such a condition as we have here sketched out\r\nwould produce a wonderful effect on the climate of Central Europe and\r\nWestern and Northern Asia. Owing to the warm currents being concentrated in\r\ninland seas instead of being dispersed over a wide ocean like the {83}\r\nNorth Atlantic, much more heat would be conveyed into the Arctic Ocean, and\r\nthis would altogether prevent the formation of ice on the northern shores\r\nof Asia, which continent did not then extend nearly so far north and was\r\nprobably deeply inter-penetrated by the sea. This open ocean to the north,\r\nand the warm currents along all the northern lands, would so equalise\r\ntemperature, that even the northern parts of Europe might then have enjoyed\r\na climate fully equal to that of the warmer parts of New Zealand at the\r\npresent day, and might have well supported the luxuriant vegetation of the\r\nMiocene period, even without any help from similar changes in the western\r\nhemisphere.[23]\r\n\r\n_Condition of North America during the Tertiary Period._--But changes of a\r\nsomewhat similar character have also taken place in America and the\r\nPacific. An enormous area west of the Mississippi, extending over much of\r\nthe Rocky Mountains, consists of marine Cretaceous beds 10,000 feet thick,\r\nindicating great and long-continued subsidence, and an insular condition of\r\nWestern America with a sea probably extending northwards to the Arctic\r\nOcean. As marine Tertiary deposits are found conformably overlying these\r\nCretaceous strata, Professor Dana is of opinion that the great elevation of\r\nthis part of America did not begin till early Tertiary times. Other\r\nTertiary beds in California, Alaska, Kamschatka, the Mackenzie River, the\r\nParry Islands, and Greenland, indicate partial submergence {84} of all\r\nthese lands with the possible influx of warm water from the Pacific; and\r\nthe considerable elevation of some of the Miocene beds in Greenland and\r\nSpitzbergen renders it probable that these countries were then much less\r\nelevated, in which case only their higher summits would be covered with\r\nperpetual snow, and no glaciers would descend to the sea.\r\n\r\nIn the Pacific there was probably an elevation of land counterbalancing, to\r\nsome extent, the great depression of so much of the northern continents.\r\nOur map in Chapter XV. shows the islands that would be produced by an\r\nelevation of the great shoals under a thousand fathoms deep, and it is seen\r\nthat these all trend in a south-east and north-west direction, and would\r\nthus facilitate the production of definite currents impelled by the\r\nsouth-east trades towards the north-west Pacific, where they would gain\r\naccess to the polar seas through Behring's Straits, which were, perhaps,\r\nsometimes both wider and deeper than at present.\r\n\r\n_Effect of these Changes on the Climate of the Arctic Regions._--These\r\nvarious changes of sea and land, all tending towards a transference of heat\r\nfrom the equator to the north temperate zone, were not improbably still\r\nfurther augmented by the existence of a great inland South American sea\r\noccupying what are now the extensive valleys of the Amazon and Orinoco, and\r\nforming an additional reservoir of super-heated water to add to the supply\r\npoured into the North Atlantic.\r\n\r\nIt is not of course supposed that all the modifications here indicated\r\nco-existed at the same time. We have good reason to believe, from the known\r\ndistribution of animals in the Tertiary period, that land-communications\r\nhave at times existed between Europe or Asia and North America, either by\r\nway of Behring's Straits, or by Iceland, Greenland, and Labrador. But the\r\nsame evidence shows that these land-communications were the exception\r\nrather than the rule, and that they occurred only at long intervals and for\r\nshort periods, so as at no time to bring about anything like a complete\r\ninterchange of the productions of the two continents.[24] We may therefore\r\nadmit that the {85} communication between the tropical and Arctic oceans\r\nwas occasionally interrupted in one or other direction; but if we look at a\r\nglobe instead of a Mercator's chart of the world, we shall see that the\r\ndisproportion between the extent of the polar and tropical seas is so\r\nenormous that a single wide opening, with an adequate impulse to carry in a\r\nconsiderable stream of warm water, would be amply sufficient for the\r\ncomplete abolition of polar snow and ice, when aided by the absence of any\r\ngreat areas of high land within the polar circle, such high land being, as\r\nwe have seen, essential to the production of perpetual snow even at the\r\npresent time.\r\n\r\nThose who wish to understand the effect of oceanic currents in conveying\r\nheat to the north temperate and polar regions, should study the papers of\r\nDr. Croll already referred to. But the same thing is equally well shown by\r\nthe facts of the actual distribution of heat due to the Gulf Stream. The\r\ndifference between the mean annual temperatures of the opposite coasts of\r\nEurope and America is well known and has been already quoted, but the\r\ndifference of their mean _winter_ temperature is still more striking, and\r\nit is this which concerns us as more especially affecting the distribution\r\nof vegetable and animal life. Our mean winter temperature in the west of\r\nEngland is the same as that of the Southern United States, as well as that\r\nof Shanghai in China, both about twenty degrees of latitude further south;\r\nand as we go northward the difference increases, so that the winter climate\r\nof Nova Scotia in Lat. 45deg is found within the Arctic circle on the coast\r\nof Norway; and if the latter country did not consist almost wholly of\r\nprecipitous snow-clad mountains, it would be capable of supporting most of\r\nthe vegetable products of the American coast in the latitude of\r\nBordeaux.[25]\r\n\r\n{86}\r\n\r\nWith these astounding facts before us, due wholly to the transference of a\r\nportion of the warm currents of the Atlantic to the shores of Europe, even\r\nwith all the disadvantages of an icy sea to the north-east and ice-covered\r\nGreenland to the north-west, how can we doubt the enormously greater effect\r\nof such a condition of things as has been shown to have existed during the\r\nTertiary epoch? Instead of _one_ great stream of warm water spreading\r\nwidely over the North Atlantic and thus losing the greater part of its\r\nstore of heat _before_ it reaches the Arctic seas, we should have _several_\r\nstreams conveying the heat of far more extensive tropical oceans by\r\ncomparatively narrow inland channels, thus being able to transfer a large\r\nproportion of their heat _into_ the northern and Arctic seas. The heat that\r\nthey gave out during the passage, instead of being widely dispersed by\r\nwinds and much of it lost in the higher atmosphere, would directly\r\nameliorate the climate of the continents they passed through, and prevent\r\nall accumulation of snow except on the loftiest mountains. The formation of\r\nice in the Arctic seas would then be impossible; and the mild winter\r\nclimate of the latitude of North {87} Carolina, which by the Gulf Stream is\r\ntransferred 20deg northwards to our islands, might certainly, under the\r\nfavourable conditions which prevailed during the Cretaceous, Eocene, and\r\nMiocene periods, have been carried another 20deg north to Greenland and\r\nSpitzbergen; and this would bring about exactly the climate indicated by\r\nthe fossil Arctic vegetation. For it must be remembered that the Arctic\r\nsummers are, even now, really hotter than ours, and if the winter's cold\r\nwere abolished and all ice-accumulation prevented, the high northern lands\r\nwould be able to support a far more luxuriant summer vegetation than is\r\npossible in our unequal and cloudy climate.[26]\r\n\r\n_Effect of High Excentricity on the Warm Polar Climates._--If the\r\nexplanation of the cause of the glacial epoch given in the last chapter is\r\na correct one, it will, I believe, follow that changes in the amount of\r\nexcentricity will produce no important alteration of the climates of the\r\ntemperate and Arctic zones so long as favourable geographical conditions,\r\nsuch as have been now sketched out, render the accumulation of ice\r\nimpossible. The effect of a high excentricity in producing a glacial epoch\r\nwas shown to be due to the capacity of snow and ice for storing up cold,\r\nand its singular power (when in large masses) of preserving itself unmelted\r\nunder a hot sun by itself causing the interposition of a protective\r\ncovering of cloud and vapour. But mobile currents of water have no such\r\npower of {88} accumulating and storing up heat or cold from one year to\r\nanother, though they do in a pre-eminent degree possess the power of\r\nequalising the temperature of winter and summer and of conveying the\r\nsuperabundant heat of the tropics to ameliorate the rigour of the Arctic\r\nwinters. However great was the difference between the amount of heat\r\nreceived from the sun in winter and summer in the Arctic zone during a\r\nperiod of high excentricity and winter in _aphelion_, the inequality would\r\nbe greatly diminished by the free ingress of warm currents to the polar\r\narea; and if this was sufficient to prevent any accumulation of ice, the\r\nsummers would be warmed to the full extent of the powers of the sun during\r\nthe long polar day, which is such as to give the pole at midsummer actually\r\nmore heat during the twenty-four hours than the equator receives during its\r\nday of twelve hours. The only difference, then, that would be directly\r\nproduced by the changes of excentricity and precession would be, that the\r\nsummers would be at one period almost tropical, at the other of a more mild\r\nand uniform temperate character; while the winters would be at one time\r\nsomewhat longer and colder, but never, probably, more severe than they are\r\nnow in the west of Scotland.\r\n\r\nBut though high excentricity would not directly modify the mild climates\r\nproduced by the state of the northern hemisphere which prevailed during\r\nCretaceous, Eocene, and Miocene times, it might indirectly affect it by\r\nincreasing the mass of Antarctic ice, and thus increasing the force of the\r\ntrade-winds and the resulting northward-flowing warm currents. Now there\r\nare many peculiarities in the distribution of plants and of some groups of\r\nanimals in the southern hemisphere, which render it almost certain that\r\nthere has sometimes been a greater extension of the Antarctic lands during\r\nTertiary times; and it is therefore not improbable that a more or less\r\nglaciated condition may have been a long persistent feature of the southern\r\nhemisphere, due to the peculiar distribution of land and sea which favours\r\nthe production of ice-fields and glaciers. And as we have seen that during\r\nthe last three million years the excentricity has been almost always much\r\nhigher than {89} it is now, we should expect that the quantity of ice in\r\nthe southern hemisphere will usually have been greater, and will thus have\r\ntended to increase the force of those oceanic currents which produce the\r\nmild climates of the northern hemisphere.\r\n\r\n_Evidences of Climate in the Secondary and Palaeozoic Epochs._--We have\r\nalready seen, that so far back as the Cretaceous period there is the most\r\nconclusive evidence of the prevalence of a very mild climate not only in\r\ntemperate but also in Arctic lands, while there is no proof whatever, or\r\neven any clear indication, of early glacial epochs at all comparable in\r\nextent and severity with that which has so recently occurred; and we have\r\nseen reason to connect this state of things with a distribution of land and\r\nsea highly favourable to the transference of warm water from equatorial to\r\npolar latitudes. So far as we can judge by the plant-remains of our own\r\ncountry, the climate appears to have been almost tropical in the Lower\r\nEocene period; and as we go further back we find no clear indications of a\r\nhigher, but often of a lower temperature, though always warmer or more\r\nequable than our present climate. The abundant corals and reptiles of the\r\nOolite and Lias indicate equally tropical conditions; but further back, in\r\nthe Trias, the flora and fauna, in the British area, become poorer, and\r\nthere is nothing incompatible with a climate no warmer than that of the\r\nUpper Miocene. This poverty is still more marked in the Permian formation,\r\nand it is here that some indications of ice-action are found in the Lower\r\nPermian conglomerates of the west of England. These beds contain abundant\r\nfragments of various rocks, often angular and sometimes weighing half a\r\nton, while others are partially rounded, and have polished and striated\r\nsurfaces, just like the stones of the \"till.\" They lie confusedly bedded in\r\na red unstratified marl, and some of them can be traced to the Welsh hills\r\nfrom twenty to fifty miles distant. This remarkable formation was first\r\npointed out as proving a remote glacial period, by Professor Ramsay; and\r\nSir Charles Lyell agreed that this is the only possible explanation that,\r\nwith our present knowledge, we can give of them.\r\n\r\nPermian breccias are also found in Ireland, containing {90} blocks of\r\nSilurian and Old Red sandstone rocks which Professor Hull believes could\r\nonly have been carried by floating ice. Similar breccias occur in the south\r\nof Scotland, and these are stated to be \"overlain by a deposit of glacial\r\nage, so similar to the breccia below as to be with difficulty distinguished\r\nfrom it.\"[27]\r\n\r\nThese numerous physical indications of ice-action over a considerable area\r\nduring the same geological period, coinciding with just such a poverty of\r\norganic remains as might be produced by a very cold climate, are very\r\nimportant, and seem clearly to indicate that at this remote period\r\ngeographical conditions were such as to bring about a glacial epoch, or\r\nperhaps only local glaciation, in our part of the world.\r\n\r\nBoulder-beds also occur in the Carboniferous formation, both in Scotland,\r\non the continent of Europe, and in North America; and Professor Dawson\r\nconsiders that he has detected true glacial deposits of the same age in\r\nNova Scotia. Boulder-beds also occur in the Silurian rocks of Scotland and\r\nNorth America, and according to Professor Dawson, even in the Huronian,\r\nolder than our Cambrian. None of these indications are however so\r\nsatisfactory as those of Permian age, where we have the very kind of\r\nevidence we looked for in vain throughout the whole of the Tertiary and\r\nSecondary periods. Its presence in several localities in such ancient rocks\r\nas the Permian is not only most important as indicating a glacial epoch of\r\nsome kind in Palaeozoic times, but confirms us in the validity of our\r\nconclusion, that the _total_ absence of any such evidence throughout the\r\nTertiary and Secondary epochs demonstrates the absence of recurring glacial\r\nepochs in the northern hemisphere, notwithstanding the frequent recurrence\r\nof periods of high excentricity.\r\n\r\n_Warm Arctic Climates in Early Secondary and Palaeozoic Times._--The\r\nevidence we have already adduced of the mild climates prevailing in the\r\nArctic regions throughout the Miocene, Eocene, and Cretaceous periods is\r\nsupplemented by a considerable body of facts relating to still earlier\r\nepochs.\r\n\r\n{91}\r\n\r\nIn the Jurassic period, for example, we have proofs of a mild Arctic\r\nclimate, in the abundant plant-remains of East Siberia and Amurland, with\r\nless productive deposits in Spitzbergen, and at Ando in Norway just within\r\nthe Arctic circle. But even more remarkable are the marine remains found in\r\nmany places in high northern latitudes, among which we may especially\r\nmention the numerous ammonites and the vertebrae of huge reptiles of the\r\ngenera Ichthyosaurus and Teleosaurus found in the Jurassic deposits of the\r\nParry Islands in 77deg N. Lat.\r\n\r\nIn the still earlier Triassic age, nautili and ammonites inhabited the seas\r\nof Spitzbergen, where their fossil remains are now found.\r\n\r\nIn the Carboniferous formation we again meet with plant-remains and beds of\r\ntrue coal in the Arctic regions. Lepidodendrons and Calamites, together\r\nwith large spreading ferns, are found at Spitzbergen, and at Bear Island in\r\nthe extreme north of Eastern Siberia; while marine deposits of the same age\r\ncontain abundance of large stony corals.\r\n\r\nLastly, the ancient Silurian limestones, which are widely spread in the\r\nhigh Arctic regions, contain abundance of corals and cephalopodous mollusca\r\nresembling those from the same deposits in more temperate lands.\r\n\r\n_Conclusions as to the Climates of Tertiary and Secondary Periods._--If now\r\nwe look at the whole series of geological facts as to the animal and\r\nvegetable productions of the Arctic regions in past ages, it is certainly\r\ndifficult to avoid the conclusion that they indicate a climate of a\r\nuniformly temperate or warm character. Whether in Miocene, Upper or Lower\r\nCretaceous, Jurassic, Triassic, Carboniferous or Silurian times, and in all\r\nthe numerous localities extending over more than half the polar regions, we\r\nfind one uniform climatic aspect in the fossils. This is quite inconsistent\r\nwith the theory of alternate cold and mild epochs during phases of high\r\nexcentricity, and persistent cold epochs when the excentricity was as low\r\nas it is now or lower, for that would imply that the duration of cold\r\nconditions was _greater_ than that of warm. Why then should the fauna and\r\nflora of the cold epochs _never_ be {92} preserved? Mollusca and many other\r\nforms of life are abundant in the Arctic seas, and there is often a\r\nluxuriant dwarf woody vegetation on the land, yet in no one case has a\r\nsingle example of such a fauna or flora been discovered of a date anterior\r\nto the last glacial epoch. And this argument is very much strengthened when\r\nwe remember that an exactly analogous series of facts is found over all the\r\ntemperate zones. Everywhere we have abundant floras and faunas indicating\r\nwarmer conditions than such as now prevail, but never in a single instance\r\none which as clearly indicates colder conditions. The fact that drift with\r\nArctic shells was deposited during the last glacial epoch, as well as\r\ngravels and crag with the remains of arctic animals and plants, shows us\r\nthat there is nothing to prevent such deposits being formed in cold as well\r\nas in warm periods; and it is quite impossible to believe that in every\r\nplace and at all epochs all records of the former have been destroyed,\r\nwhile in a considerable number of instances those of the latter have been\r\npreserved. When to this uniform testimony of the palaeontological evidence\r\nwe add the equally uniform absence of any indication of those ice-borne\r\nrocks, boulders, and drift, which are the constant and necessary\r\naccompaniment of every period of glaciation, and which must inevitably\r\npervade all the marine deposits formed over a wide area so long as the\r\nstate of glaciation continues, we are driven to the conclusion that the\r\nlast glacial epoch of the northern hemisphere was exceptional, and was not\r\npreceded by numerous similar glacial epochs throughout Tertiary and\r\nSecondary time.\r\n\r\nBut although glacial epochs (with the one or two exceptions already\r\nreferred to) were certainly absent, considerable changes of climate may\r\nhave frequently occurred, and these would lead to important changes in the\r\norganic world. We can hardly doubt that some such change occurred between\r\nthe Lower and Upper Cretaceous periods, the floras of which exhibit such an\r\nextraordinary contrast in general character. We have also the testimony of\r\nMr. J. S. Gardner, who has long worked at the fossil floras of the Tertiary\r\ndeposits, and who states, that {93} there is strong negative and some\r\npositive evidence of alternating warmer and colder conditions, not glacial,\r\ncontained not only in English Eocene, but all Tertiary beds throughout the\r\nworld.[28] In the case of marine faunas it is more difficult to judge, but\r\nthe numerous changes in the fossil remains from bed to bed only a few feet\r\nand sometimes a few inches apart, may be sometimes due to change of\r\nclimate; and when it is recognised that such changes have probably occurred\r\nat all geological epochs and their effects are systematically searched for,\r\nmany peculiarities in the distribution of organisms through the different\r\nmembers of one deposit may be traced to this cause.\r\n\r\n_General View of Geological Climates as dependent on the Physical Features\r\nof the Earth's Surface._--In the preceding chapters I have earnestly\r\nendeavoured to arrive at an explanation of geological climates in the\r\ntemperate and Arctic zones, which should be in harmony with the great body\r\nof geological facts now available for their elucidation. If my conclusions\r\nas here set forth diverge considerably from those of Dr. Croll, it is not\r\nfrom any want of appreciation of his facts and arguments, since for many\r\nyears I have upheld and enforced his views to the best of my ability. But a\r\ncareful re-examination of the whole question has now convinced me that an\r\nerror has been made in estimating the comparative effect of geographical\r\nand astronomical causes on changes of climate, and that, while the latter\r\nhave undoubtedly played an important part in bringing about the glacial\r\nepoch, it is to the former that the mild climates of the Arctic regions are\r\nalmost entirely due. If I have now succeeded in approaching to a true\r\nsolution of this difficult problem, I owe it mainly to the study of Dr.\r\nCroll's writings, since my theory is entirely based on the facts and\r\nprinciples so clearly set forth in his admirable papers on \"Ocean Currents\r\nin relation to the Distribution of Heat over the Globe.\" The main features\r\nof this theory as distinct from that of Dr. Croll I will now endeavour to\r\nsummarise.\r\n\r\nLooking at the subject broadly, we see that the climatic {94} condition of\r\nthe northern hemisphere is the result of the peculiar distribution of land\r\nand water upon the globe; and the general permanence of the position of the\r\ncontinental and oceanic areas--which we have shown to be proved by so many\r\ndistinct lines of evidence--is also implied by the general stability of\r\nclimate throughout long geological periods. The land surface of our earth\r\nappears to have always consisted of three great masses in the north\r\ntemperate zone, narrowing southward, and terminating in three comparatively\r\nnarrow extremities represented by Southern America, South Africa, and\r\nAustralia. Towards the north these masses have approached each other, and\r\nhave sometimes become united; leaving beyond them a considerable area of\r\nopen polar sea. Towards the south they have never been much further\r\nprolonged than at present, but far beyond their extremities an extensive\r\nmass of land has occupied the south polar area.\r\n\r\nThis arrangement is such as would cause the northern hemisphere to be\r\nalways (as it is now) warmer than the southern, and this would lead to the\r\npreponderance of northward winds and ocean currents, and would bring about\r\nthe concentration of the latter in three great streams carrying warmth to\r\nthe north-polar regions. These streams would, as Dr. Croll has so well\r\nshown, be greatly increased in power by the glaciation of the south polar\r\nland; and whenever any considerable portion of this land was elevated, such\r\na condition of glaciation would certainly be brought about, and would be\r\nheightened whenever a high degree of excentricity prevailed.\r\n\r\nIt is now the general opinion of geologists that the great continents have\r\nundergone a process of development from earlier to later times. Professor\r\nDana appears to have been the first who taught it explicitly in the case of\r\nthe North American continent, and he has continued the development of his\r\nviews from 1856, when he discussed the subject in the _American Journal_,\r\nto the later editions of his _Manual of Geology_ in which the same views\r\nare extended to all the great continents. He says:--\r\n\r\n\"The North American continent, which since early {95} time had been\r\ngradually expanding in each direction from the northern Azoic, eastward,\r\nwestward, and southward, and which, after the Palaeozoic, was finished in\r\nits rocky foundation, excepting on the borders of the Atlantic and Pacific\r\nand the area of the Rocky Mountains, had reached its full expansion at the\r\nclose of the Tertiary period. The progress from the first was uniform and\r\nsystematic: the land was at all times simple in outline; and its\r\nenlargement took place with almost the regularity of an exogenous\r\nplant.\"[29]\r\n\r\nA similar development undoubtedly took place in the European area, which\r\nwas apparently never so compact and so little interpenetrated by the sea as\r\nit is now, while Europe and Asia have only become united into one unbroken\r\nmass since late Tertiary times.\r\n\r\nIf, however, the greater continents have become more compact and massive\r\nfrom age to age, and have received their chief extensions northward at a\r\ncomparatively recent period, while the Antarctic lands had a corresponding\r\nbut somewhat earlier development, we have all the conditions requisite to\r\nexplain the persistence, with slight fluctuations, of warm climates far\r\ninto the north-polar area throughout Palaeozoic, Mesozoic, and Tertiary\r\ntimes. At length, during the latter part of the Tertiary epoch, a\r\nconsiderable elevation took place, closing up several of the water passages\r\nto the north, and raising up extensive areas in the Arctic regions to\r\nbecome the receptacle of snow and ice-fields. This elevation is indicated\r\nby the abundance of Miocene and the absence of Pliocene deposits in the\r\nArctic zone and the considerable altitude of many Miocene rocks in Europe\r\nand North America; and the occurrence at this time of a long-continued\r\nperiod of high excentricity necessarily brought on the glacial epoch in the\r\nmanner already described in our last chapter. A depression seems to have\r\noccurred during the glacial period itself in North America as in Britain,\r\nbut this may have been due partly to the weight of the ice and partly to a\r\nrise of the ocean {96} level caused by the earth's centre of gravity being\r\nshifted towards the north.\r\n\r\nWe thus see that the last glacial epoch was the climax of a great process\r\nof continental development which had been going on throughout long\r\ngeological ages; and that it was the direct consequence of the north\r\ntemperate and polar land having attained a great extension and a\r\nconsiderable altitude just at the time when a phase of very high\r\nexcentricity was coming on. Throughout earlier Tertiary and Secondary times\r\nan equally high excentricity often occurred, but it never produced a\r\nglacial epoch, because the north temperate and polar areas had less high\r\nland, and were more freely open to the influx of warm oceanic currents. But\r\nwherever great plateaux with lofty mountains occurred in the temperate zone\r\na considerable _local_ glaciation might be produced, which would be\r\nspecially intense during periods of high excentricity; and it is to such\r\ncauses we must impute the indications of ice-action in the vicinity of the\r\nAlps during the Tertiary period. The Permian glaciation appears to have\r\nbeen more extensive, and it is quite possible that at this remote epoch a\r\nsufficient mass of high land existed in our area and northwards towards the\r\npole, to have brought on a true glacial period comparable with that which\r\nhas so recently passed away.\r\n\r\n_Estimate of the comparative effects of Geographical and Astronomical\r\nCauses in producing Changes of Climate._--It appears then, that while\r\ngeographical and physical causes alone, by their influence on ocean\r\ncurrents, have been the main agents in producing the mild climates which\r\nfor such long periods prevailed in the Arctic regions, the concurrence of\r\nastronomical causes--high excentricity with winter in _aphelion_--was\r\nnecessary to the production of the great glacial epoch. If we reject this\r\nlatter agency, we shall be obliged to imagine a concurrence of geographical\r\nchanges at a very recent period of which we have no evidence. We must\r\nsuppose, for example, that a large part of the British Isles--Scotland,\r\nIreland, and Wales at all events--were simultaneously elevated so as to\r\nbring extensive areas above the line of perpetual snow; that {97} about the\r\nsame time Scandinavia, the Alps, and the Pyrenees received a similar\r\nincrease of altitude; and that, almost simultaneously, Eastern North\r\nAmerica, the Sierra Nevada of California, the Caucasus, Lebanon, the\r\nsouthern mountains of Spain, the Atlas range, and the Himalayas, were each\r\nsome thousands of feet higher than they are now; for all these mountains\r\npresent us with indications of a recent extension of their glaciers, in\r\nsuperficial phenomena so similar to those which occur in our own country\r\nand in Western Europe, that we cannot suppose them to belong to a different\r\nepoch. Such a supposition is rendered more difficult by the general\r\nconcurrence of scientific testimony to a partial submergence during the\r\nglacial epoch, not only in all parts of Britain, but in North America,\r\nScandinavia, and, as shown by the wide extension of the drift, in Northern\r\nEurope; and when to this we add the difficulty of understanding how any\r\nprobable addition to the altitude of our islands could have brought about\r\nthe extreme amount of glaciation which they certainly underwent, and when,\r\nfurther, we know that a phase of very high excentricity did occur at a\r\nperiod which is generally admitted to agree well with physical evidence of\r\nthe time elapsed since the cold passed away, there seems no sufficient\r\nreason why such an agency should be ignored.\r\n\r\nNo doubt a prejudice has been excited against it in the minds of many\r\ngeologists, by its being thought to lead _necessarily_ to frequently\r\nrecurring glacial epochs throughout all geological time. But I have here\r\nendeavoured to show that this is _not_ a necessary consequence of the\r\ntheory, because a concurrence of favourable geographical conditions is\r\nessential to the initiation of a glaciation, which when once initiated has\r\na tendency to maintain itself throughout the varying phases of precession\r\noccurring during a period of high excentricity. When, however, geographical\r\nconditions favour warm Arctic climates--as it has been shown they have done\r\nthroughout the larger portion of geological time--then changes of\r\nexcentricity, to however great an extent, have no tendency to bring about a\r\nstate of glaciation, because warm oceanic currents have a {98}\r\npreponderating influence, and without very large areas of high northern\r\nland to act as condensers, no perpetual snow is possible, and hence the\r\ninitial process of glaciation does not occur.\r\n\r\nThe theory as now set forth should commend itself to geologists, since it\r\nshows the direct dependence of climate on physical processes, which are\r\nguided and modified by those changes in the earth's surface which geology\r\nalone can trace out. It is in perfect accord with the most recent teachings\r\nof the science as to the gradual and progressive development of the earth's\r\ncrust from the rudimentary formations of the Azoic age, and it lends\r\nsupport to the view that no inportant[**important] departure from the great\r\nlines of elevation and depression originally marked out on the earth's\r\nsurface has ever taken place.\r\n\r\nIt also shows us how important an agent in the production of a habitable\r\nglobe with comparatively small extremes of climates over its whole area, is\r\nthe great disproportion between the extent of the land and the water\r\nsurfaces. For if these proportions had been reversed, large areas of land\r\nwould necessarily have been removed from the beneficial influence of\r\naqueous currents or moisture-laden winds; and slight geological changes\r\nmight easily have led to half the land surface becoming covered with\r\nperpetual snow and ice, or being exposed to extremes of summer heat and\r\nwinter cold, of which our water-permeated globe at present affords no\r\nexample. We thus see that what are usually regarded as geographical\r\nanomalies--the disproportion of land and water, the gathering of the land\r\nmainly into one hemisphere, and the singular arrangement of the land in\r\nthree great southward-pointing masses--are really facts of the greatest\r\nsignificance and importance, since it is to these very anomalies that the\r\nuniversal spread of vegetation and the adaptability of so large a portion\r\nof the earth's surface for human habitation is directly due.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{99}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTHE EARTH'S AGE, AND THE RATE OF DEVELOPMENT OF ANIMALS AND PLANTS\r\n\r\n    Various Estimates of Geological Time--Denudation and Deposition of\r\n    Strata as a Measure of Time--How to Estimate the Thickness of the\r\n    Sedimentary Rocks--How to Estimate the Average Rate of Deposition of\r\n    the Sedimentary Rocks--The Rate of Geological Change Probably greater\r\n    in very Remote Times--Value of the Preceding Estimate of Geological\r\n    Time--Organic Modification Dependent on Change of\r\n    Conditions--Geographical Mutations as a Motive Power in bringing about\r\n    Organic Changes--Climatal Revolutions as an Agent in Producing Organic\r\n    Changes--Present Condition of the Earth one of Exceptional Stability as\r\n    Regards Climate--Date of last Glacial Epoch and its Bearing on the\r\n    Measurement of Geological Time--Concluding Remarks.\r\n\r\nThe subjects discussed in the last three chapters introduce us to a\r\ndifficulty which has hitherto been considered a very formidable one--that\r\nthe maximum age of the habitable earth, as deduced from physical\r\nconsiderations, does not afford sufficient time either for the geological\r\nor the organic changes of which we have evidence. Geologists continually\r\ndwell on the slowness of the processes of upheaval and subsidence, of\r\ndenudation of the earth's surface, and of the formation of new strata;\r\nwhile on the theory of development, as expounded by Mr. Darwin, the\r\nvariation and modification of organic forms is also a very slow process,\r\nand has usually been considered to require an {100} even longer series of\r\nages than might satisfy the requirements of physical geology alone.\r\n\r\nAs an indication of the periods usually contemplated by geologists, we may\r\nrefer to Sir Charles Lyell's calculation in the tenth edition of his\r\n_Principles of Geology_ (omitted in later editions), by which he arrived at\r\n240 millions of years as having probably elapsed since the Cambrian\r\nperiod--a very moderate estimate in the opinion of most geologists. This\r\ncalculation was founded on the rate of modification of the species of\r\nmollusca; but much more recently Professor Haughton has arrived at nearly\r\nsimilar figures from a consideration of the rate of formation of rocks and\r\ntheir known maximum thickness, whence he deduces a maximum of 200 millions\r\nof years for the whole duration of geological time, as indicated by the\r\nseries of stratified formations.[30] But in the opinion of all our first\r\nnaturalists and geologists, the period occupied in the formation of the\r\nknown stratified rocks only represents a portion, and perhaps a small\r\nportion, of geological time. In the sixth edition of the _Origin of\r\nSpecies_ (p. 286), Mr. Darwin says: \"Consequently, if the theory be true,\r\nit is indisputable that before the lowest Cambrian stratum was deposited\r\nlong periods elapsed, as long as, or probably far longer than, the whole\r\ninterval from the Cambrian age to the present day; and that during these\r\nvast periods the world swarmed with living creatures.\" Professor Huxley, in\r\nhis anniversary address to the Geological Society in 1870, adduced a number\r\nof special cases showing that, on the theory of development, almost all the\r\nhigher forms of life must have existed during the Palaeozoic period. Thus,\r\nfrom the fact that almost the whole of the Tertiary period has been\r\nrequired to convert the ancestral Orohippus into the true horse, he\r\nbelieves that, in order to have time for the much greater change of the\r\nancestral Ungulata into the two great odd-toed and even-toed divisions (of\r\nwhich change there is no trace even among the earliest Eocene mammals), we\r\nshould require a large portion, if not the whole, of the Mesozoic or\r\nSecondary period. Another case is furnished by the bats and whales, both of\r\nwhich strange modifications of the {101} mammalian type occur perfectly\r\ndeveloped in the Eocene formation. What countless ages back must we then go\r\nfor the origin of these groups, the whales from some ancestral carnivorous\r\nanimal, and the bats from the insectivora! And even then we have to seek\r\nfor the common origin of carnivora, insectivora, ungulata, and marsupials\r\nat a far earlier period; so that, on the lowest estimate, we must place the\r\norigin of the mammalia very far back in Palaeozoic times. Similar evidence\r\nis afforded by reptiles, of which Professor Huxley says: \"If the very small\r\ndifferences which are observable between the crocodiles of the older\r\nSecondary formations and those of the present day furnish any sort of an\r\napproximation towards an estimate of the average rate of change among\r\nreptiles, it is almost appalling to reflect how far back in Palaeozoic\r\ntimes we must go before we can hope to arrive at that common stock from\r\nwhich the crocodiles, lizards, _Ornithoscelida_, and _Plesiosauria_, which\r\nhad attained so great a development in the Triassic epoch, must have been\r\nderived.\" Professor Ramsay has expressed similar views, derived from a\r\ngeneral study of the whole series of geological formations and their\r\ncontained fossils. He says, speaking of the abundant, varied, and\r\nwell-developed fauna of the Cambrian period: \"In this earliest known\r\n_varied_ life we find no evidence of its having lived near the beginning of\r\nthe zoological series. In a broad sense, compared with what must have gone\r\nbefore, both biologically and physically, all the phenomena connected with\r\nthis old period seem, to my mind, to be of quite a recent description; and\r\nthe climates of seas and lands were of the very same kind as those the\r\nworld enjoys at the present day.\"[31]\r\n\r\nThese opinions, and the facts on which they are founded, are so weighty,\r\nthat we can hardly doubt that, if the time since the Cambrian epoch is\r\ncorrectly estimated at 200 millions of years, the date of the commencement\r\nof life on the earth cannot be much less than 500 millions; while it may\r\nnot improbably have been longer, because the reaction of {102} the organism\r\nunder changes of the environment is believed to have been less active in\r\nlow and simple, than in high and complex forms of life, and thus the\r\nprocesses of organic development may for countless ages have been\r\nexcessively slow.\r\n\r\nBut according to the physicists, no such periods as are here contemplated\r\ncan be granted. From a consideration of the possible sources of the heat of\r\nthe sun, as well as from calculations of the period during which the earth\r\ncan have been cooling to bring about the present rate of increase of\r\ntemperature as we descend beneath the surface, Sir William Thomson\r\nconcludes that the crust of the earth cannot have been solidified much\r\nlonger than 100 million years (the maximum possible being 400 millions),\r\nand this conclusion is held by Dr. Croll and other men of eminence to be\r\nalmost indisputable.[32] It will therefore be well to consider on what data\r\nthe calculations of geologists have been founded, and how far the views\r\nhere set forth, as to frequent changes of climate throughout all geological\r\ntime, may affect the rate of biological change.\r\n\r\n_Denudation and Deposition of Strata as a Measure of Time._--The materials\r\nof all the stratified rocks of the globe have been obtained from the dry\r\nland. Every point of the surface is exposed to the destructive influences\r\nof sun and wind, frost, snow, and rain, which break up and wear away the\r\nhardest rocks as well as the softer deposits, and by means of rivers convey\r\nthe worn material to the sea. The existence of a considerable depth of soil\r\nover the greater part of the earth's surface; of vast heaps of rocky\r\n_debris_ at the foot of every inland cliff; of enormous deposits of gravel,\r\nsand, and loam; as well as the shingle, pebbles, sand or mud, of every\r\nsea-shore, alike attest the universality of this destructive agency. It is\r\nno less clearly shown by the way in which almost every drop of running\r\nwater--whether in gutter, brooklet, stream or large river--becomes\r\ndiscoloured after each heavy rainfall, since the matter which causes this\r\ndiscolouration must be derived from the surface {103} of the country, must\r\nalways pass from a higher to a lower level, and must ultimately reach the\r\nsea, unless it is first deposited in some lake, or by the overflowing of a\r\nriver goes to form an alluvial plain. The universality of this subaerial\r\ndenudation, both as regards space and time, renders it certain that its\r\ncumulative effects must be very great; but no attempt seems to have been\r\nmade to determine the magnitude of these effects till Mr. Alfred Tylor, in\r\n1853,[33] pointed out that by measuring the quantity of solid matter\r\nbrought down by rivers (which can be done with considerable accuracy), we\r\nmay obtain the amount of lowering of the land-area, and also the rise of\r\nthe ocean level, owing to the quantity of matter deposited on its floor. A\r\nfew years later Dr. Croll applied the same method in more detail to an\r\nestimate of the amount by which the land is lowered in a given period; and\r\nthe validity of this method has been upheld by Sir A. Geikie, Sir Charles\r\nLyell, and all our best geologists, as affording a means of actually\r\ndetermining with some approach to accuracy, the time occupied by one\r\nimportant phase of geological change.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of matter carried away from the land by a river is greater\r\nthan at first sight appears, and is more likely to be under- than\r\nover-estimated. By taking samples of water near the mouth of a river (but\r\nabove the influence of the tide) at a sufficient number of points in its\r\nchannel and at different depths, and repeating this daily or at other short\r\nintervals throughout the year, it is easy to determine the quantity of\r\nsolid matter held in suspension and solution; and if corresponding\r\nobservations determine the quantity of water that is discharged, the total\r\namount of solid matter brought down annually may be calculated. But besides\r\nthis, a considerable quantity of sand or even gravel is carried along the\r\nbottom or bed of the river, and this has rarely been estimated, so that the\r\nfigures hitherto obtained are usually under the real quantities. There is\r\nalso another source of error caused by the quantity of matter the river may\r\ndeposit in lakes or in flooded lands during its course, for this adds to\r\nthe amount of denudation performed by the river, although {104} the matter\r\nso deposited does not come down to the sea. After a careful examination of\r\nall the best records, Sir A. Geikie arrives at the following results, as to\r\nthe quantity of matter removed by seven rivers from their basins, estimated\r\nby the number of years required to lower the whole surface an average of\r\none foot:\r\n\r\n  The Mississippi removes one foot in 6,000 years.\r\n  ,,   Ganges       ,,       ,,       2,358   ,,\r\n  ,,   Hoang Ho     ,,       ,,       1,464   ,,\r\n  ,,   Rhone        ,,       ,,       1,528   ,,\r\n  ,,   Danube       ,,       ,,       6,846   ,,\r\n  ,,   Po           ,,       ,,         729   ,,\r\n  ,,   Nith         ,,       ,,       4,723   ,,\r\n\r\nHere we see an intelligible relation between the character of the river\r\nbasin and the amount of denudation. The Mississippi has a large portion of\r\nits basin in an arid country, and its sources are either in forest-clad\r\nplateaux or in mountains free from glaciers and with a scanty rainfall. The\r\nDanube flows through Eastern Europe where the rainfall is considerably less\r\nthan in the west, while comparatively few of its tributaries rise among the\r\nloftiest Alps. The proportionate amounts of denudation being then what we\r\nmight expect, and as all are probably under rather than over the truth, we\r\nmay safely take the average of them all as representing an amount of\r\ndenudation which, if not true for the whole land surface of the globe, will\r\ncertainly be so for a very considerable proportion of it. This average is\r\nalmost exactly one foot in three thousand years.[34] The mean altitude of\r\nthe several {105} continents has been recently estimated by Mr. John\r\nMurray,[35] to be as follows: Europe 939 feet, Asia 3,189 feet, Africa 2020\r\nfeet, North America 1,888 feet, and South America 2,078 feet. At the rate\r\nof denudation above given, it results that, were no other forces at work,\r\nEurope would be planed down to the sea-level in about two million eight\r\nhundred thousand years; while if we take a somewhat slower rate for North\r\nAmerica, that continent might last about four or five million years.[36]\r\nThis also implies that the mean height of these continents would have been\r\nabout double what it is now three million and five million years ago\r\nrespectively: and as we have no reason to suppose this to have been the\r\ncase, we are led to infer the constant action of that upheaving force which\r\nthe presence of sedimentary formations even on the highest mountains also\r\ndemonstrates.\r\n\r\nWe have already discussed the unequal rate of denudation on hills, valleys,\r\nand lowlands, in connection with the evidence of remote glacial epochs (p.\r\n173); what we have now to consider is, what becomes of all this denuded\r\nmatter, and how far the known rate of denudation affords us a measure of\r\nthe rate of deposition, and thus gives us some indication of the lapse of\r\ngeological time from a comparison of this rate with the observed thickness\r\nof stratified rocks on the earth's surface.\r\n\r\n{106}\r\n\r\n_How to Estimate the Thickness of the Sedimentary Rocks._--The sedimentary\r\nrocks of which the earth's crust is mainly composed consist, according to\r\nSir Charles Lyell's classification, of fourteen great formations, of which\r\nthe most ancient is the Laurentian, and the most recent the Post-Tertiary\r\nor Pleistocene; with thirty important subdivisions, each of which again\r\nconsists of a more or less considerable number of distinct beds or strata.\r\nThus, the Silurian formation is divided into Upper and Lower Silurian, each\r\ncharacterized by a distinct set of fossil remains, and the Upper Silurian\r\nagain consists of a large number of separate beds, such as the Wenlock\r\nLimestone, the Upper Llandovery Sandstone the Lower Llandovery Slates, &c.,\r\neach usually characterised by a difference of mineral composition or\r\nmechanical structure, as well as by some peculiar fossils. These beds and\r\nformations vary greatly in extent, both above and beneath the surface, and\r\nare also of very various thicknesses in different localities. A thick bed\r\nor series of beds often thins out in a given direction, and sometimes\r\ndisappears altogether, so that two beds which were respectively above and\r\nbeneath it may come into contact. As an example of this thinning out,\r\nAmerican geologists adduce the Palaeozoic formations of the Appalachian\r\nMountains, which have a total thickness of 42,000 feet, but as they are\r\ntraced westward thin out till they become only 4,000 feet in total\r\nthickness. In like manner the Carboniferous grits and shales are 18,000\r\nfeet thick in Yorkshire and Lancashire, but they thin out southwards, so\r\nthat in Leicestershire they are only 3,000 feet thick; and similar\r\nphenomena occur in all strata and in every part of the world. It must be\r\nobserved that this thinning out has nothing to do with denudation (which\r\nacts upon the surface of a country so as to produce great irregularities of\r\ncontour), but is a regular attenuation of the layers of rock, due to a\r\ndeficiency of sediment in certain directions at the original formation of\r\nthe deposit. Owing to this thinning out of stratified rocks, they are on\r\nthe whole of far less extent than is usually supposed. When we see a\r\ngeological map showing successive formations following each other in long\r\nirregular belts across the country (as is well {107} seen in the case of\r\nthe Secondary rocks of England), and a corresponding section showing each\r\nbed dipping beneath its predecessor, we are apt to imagine that beneath the\r\nuppermost bed we should find all the others following in succession like\r\nthe coats of an onion. But this is far from being the case, and a\r\nremarkable proof of the narrow limitation of these formations has been\r\nrecently obtained by a boring at Ware through the Chalk and Gault Clay,\r\nwhich latter immediately rests on the Upper Silurian Wenlock Limestone full\r\nof characteristic fossils, at a depth of only 800 feet. Here we have an\r\nenormous gap, showing that none of earlier Secondary or late Palaeozoic\r\nformations extend to this part of England, unless indeed they had been all\r\nonce elevated and entirely swept away by denudation.[37]\r\n\r\nBut if we consider how such deposits are now forming, we shall find that\r\nthe thinning out of the beds of each formation, and their restriction to\r\nirregular bands and patches, is exactly what we should expect. The enormous\r\nquantity of sediment continually poured into the sea by rivers, gradually\r\nsubsides to the bottom as soon as the motion of the water is checked. All\r\nthe heavier material must be deposited near the shore or in those areas\r\nover which it is first spread by the tides or currents of the ocean; while\r\nonly the very fine mud and clay is carried out to considerable distances.\r\nThus all stratified deposits {108} will form most quickly near the shores,\r\nand will thin out rapidly at greater distances, little or none being formed\r\nin the depths of the great oceans. This important fact was demonstrated by\r\nthe specimens of sea-bottom examined during the voyage of the _Challenger_,\r\nall the \"shore deposits\" being usually confined within a distance of 100 or\r\n150 miles from the coast; while the \"deep-sea deposits\" are either purely\r\norganic, being formed of the calcareous or siliceous skeletons of\r\nglobigerinae, radiolarians, and diatomaceae, or are clays formed of\r\nundissolved portions of these, together with the disintegrated or dissolved\r\nmaterials of pumice and volcanic dust, which being very light are carried\r\nby wind or by water over the widest oceans.\r\n\r\nFrom the preceding considerations we shall be better able to appreciate the\r\ncalculations as to the thickness of stratified deposits made by geologists.\r\nProfessor Ramsay has calculated that the sedimentary rocks of Britain alone\r\nhave a total _maximum_ thickness of 72,600 feet; while Professor Haughton,\r\nfrom a survey of the whole world, estimates the _maximum_ thickness of the\r\nknown stratified rocks at 177,200 feet. Now these _maximum_ thicknesses of\r\neach deposit will have been produced only where the conditions were\r\nexceptionally favourable, either in deep water near the mouths of great\r\nrivers, or in inland seas, or in places to which the drainage of extensive\r\ncountries was conveyed by ocean currents; and this great thickness will\r\nnecessarily be accompanied by a corresponding thinness, or complete absence\r\nof deposit, elsewhere. How far the series of rocks found in any extensive\r\narea, as Europe or North America, represents the whole series of deposits\r\nwhich have been made there we cannot tell; but there is no reason to think\r\nthat it is a very inadequate representation of their _maximum_ thickness,\r\nthough it undoubtedly is of their _extent_ and _bulk_. When we see in how\r\nmany distinct localities patches of the same formation occur, it seems\r\nimprobable that the whole of the deposits formed during any one period\r\nshould have been destroyed, even in such an area as Europe, while it is\r\nstill more improbable that they should be so destroyed over the whole\r\nworld; and {109} if any considerable portion of them is left, that portion\r\nmay give a fair idea of their average, or even of their maximum, thickness.\r\nIn his admirable paper on \"The Mean Thickness of the Sedimentary\r\nRocks,\"[38] Dr. James Croll has dwelt on the extent of denudation in\r\ndiminishing the mean thickness of the rocks that have been formed,\r\nremarking, \"Whatever the present mean thickness of all the sedimentary\r\nrocks of our globe may be, it must be small in comparison to the mean\r\nthickness of all the sedimentary rocks which have been formed. This is\r\nobvious from the fact that the sedimentary rocks of one age are partly\r\nformed from the destruction of the sedimentary rocks of former ages. From\r\nthe Laurentian age down to the present day the stratified rocks have been\r\nundergoing constant denudation.\" This is perfectly true, and yet the mean\r\nthickness of that portion of the sedimentary rocks which remains may not be\r\nvery different from that of the entire mass, because denudation acts only\r\non those rocks which are exposed on the surface of a country, and most\r\nlargely on those that are upheaved; while, except in the rare case of an\r\nextensive formation being _quite horizontal_, and wholly exposed to the sea\r\nor to the atmosphere, denudation can have no tendency to diminish the\r\nthickness of any entire deposit.[39] Unless, therefore, a formation is\r\ncompletely destroyed by denudation in every part of the world (a thing very\r\nimprobable), we may have in existing rocks a not very inadequate\r\nrepresentation of the _mean thickness_ of all that have been formed, and\r\neven of the _maximum_ thickness of the larger portion. This will be the\r\nmore likely because it is almost certain that many rocks contemporaneously\r\nformed are counted by geologists as distinct formations, whenever they\r\ndiffer in lithological character or in organic remains. But we know that\r\nlimestones, sandstones, and shales, are always forming at the same time;\r\n{110} while a great difference in organic remains may arise from\r\ncomparatively slight changes of geographical features, or from difference\r\nin the depth or purity of the water in which the animals lived.[40]\r\n\r\n_How to Estimate the Average Rate of Deposition of the Sedimentary\r\nRocks._--But if we take the estimate of Professor Haughton (177,200 feet),\r\nwhich, as we have seen, is probably excessive, for the maximum thickness of\r\nthe sedimentary rocks of the globe of all known geological ages, can we\r\narrive at any estimate of the rate at which they were formed? Dr. Croll has\r\nattempted to make such an estimate, but he has taken for his basis the\r\n_mean_ thickness of the rocks, which we have no means whatever of arriving\r\nat, and which he guesses, allowing for denudation, to be equal to the\r\n_maximum_ thickness as measured by geologists. The land-area of the globe\r\nis, according to Dr. Croll, 57,000,000[41] square miles, and he gives the\r\ncoast-line as 116,000 miles. This, however, is, for our purpose, rather too\r\nmuch, as it allows for bays, inlets, and the smaller islands. An\r\napproximate measurement on a globe shows that 100,000 miles will be nearer\r\nthe mark, and this has the advantage of being an easily remembered even\r\nnumber. The distance from the coast, to which shore-deposits usually\r\nextend, may be reckoned at about 100 or 150 miles, but by far the larger\r\nportion of the matter brought down from the land will be deposited\r\ncomparatively close to the shore; that is, within twenty or thirty miles.\r\nIf we suppose the portion deposited beyond thirty miles to be added to the\r\ndeposits within that distance, and the whole reduced to a uniform thickness\r\nin a direction at right angles to the coast, we should probably include all\r\nareas where deposits of the maximum thickness {111} are forming at the\r\npresent time, along with a large but unknown proportion of surface where\r\nthe deposits were far below the maximum thickness. This follows, if we\r\nconsider that deposit must go on very unequally along different parts of a\r\ncoast, owing to the distance from each other of the mouths of great rivers\r\nand the limitations of ocean currents; and because, compared with the areas\r\nover which a thick deposit is forming annually, those where there is little\r\nor none are probably at least twice as extensive. If, therefore, we take a\r\nwidth of thirty miles along the whole coast-line of the globe as\r\nrepresenting the area over which deposits are forming, corresponding to the\r\nmaximum thickness as measured by geologists, we shall certainly over rather\r\nthan under-estimate the possible rate of deposit.[42]\r\n\r\nNow a coast line of 100,000 miles with a width of 30 gives an area of\r\n3,000,000 square miles, on which the denuded matter of the whole land-area\r\nof 57,000,000 square {112} miles is deposited. As these two areas are as 1\r\nto 19, it follows that deposition, as measured by _maximum_ thickness, goes\r\non at least nineteen times as fast as denudation--probably very much\r\nfaster. But the mean rate of denudation over the whole earth is about one\r\nfoot in three thousand years; therefore the rate of maximum deposition will\r\nbe at least 19 feet in the same time; and as the total maximum thickness of\r\nall the stratified rocks of the globe is, according to Professor Haughton,\r\n177,200 feet, the time required to produce this thickness of rock, at the\r\npresent rate of denudation and deposition, is only 28,000,000 years.[43]\r\n\r\n_The Rate of Geological Change Probably Greater in very Remote Times._--The\r\nopinion that denudation and deposition went on more rapidly in earlier\r\ntimes owing to the frequent occurrence of vast convulsions and cataclysms\r\nwas strenuously opposed by Sir Charles Lyell, who so well showed that\r\ncauses of the very same nature as those now in action were sufficient to\r\naccount for all the phenomena presented by the rocks throughout the whole\r\nseries of geological formations. But while upholding the soundness of the\r\nviews of the \"uniformitarians\" as opposed to the \"convulsionists,\" we must\r\nyet admit that there is reason for believing in a gradually increasing\r\nintensity of all telluric action as we go back into past time. This subject\r\nhas been well treated by Mr. W. J. Sollas,[44] who shows that, if, as all\r\nphysicists maintain, the sun gave out perceptibly more heat in past ages\r\nthan now, this alone would cause an increase in almost all the forces that\r\nhave brought about geological phenomena. With greater heat there would be a\r\nmore extensive aqueous atmosphere, and, perhaps, a greater difference\r\nbetween equatorial and polar temperatures; hence more violent winds,\r\nheavier rains and snows, {113} and more powerful oceanic currents, all\r\nproducing more rapid denudation. At the same time, the internal heat of the\r\nearth being greater, it would be cooling more rapidly, and thus the forces\r\nof contraction--which cause the upheaving of mountains, the eruption of\r\nvolcanoes, and the subsidence of extensive areas--would be more powerful\r\nand would still further aid the process of denudation. Yet again, the\r\nearth's rotation was certainly more rapid in very remote times, and this\r\nwould cause more impetuous tides and still further add to the denuding\r\npower of the ocean. It thus appears that, as we go back into the past,\r\n_all_ the forces tending to the continued destruction and renewal of the\r\nearth's surface would be in more powerful action, and must therefore tend\r\nto reduce the time required for the deposition and upheaval of the various\r\ngeological formations. It may be true, as many geologists assert, that the\r\nchanges here indicated are so slow that they would produce comparatively\r\nlittle effect within the time occupied by the known sedimentary rocks, yet,\r\nwhatever effect they did produce would certainly be in the direction here\r\nindicated, and as several causes are acting together, their combined\r\neffects may have been by no means unimportant. It must also be remembered\r\nthat such an increase of the primary forces on which all geologic change\r\ndepends would act with great effect in still further intensifying those\r\nalternations of cold and warm periods in each hemisphere, or, more\r\nfrequently, of excessive and equable seasons, which have been shown to be\r\nthe result of astronomical, combined with geographical, revolutions; and\r\nthis would again increase the rapidity of denudation and deposition, and\r\nthus still further reduce the time required for the production of the known\r\nsedimentary rocks. It is evident therefore that these various\r\nconsiderations all combine to prove that, in supposing that the rate of\r\ndenudation has been on the average only what it is now, we are almost\r\ncertainly over-estimating the _time_ required to have produced the whole\r\nseries of formations from the Cambrian upwards.\r\n\r\n_Value of the Preceding Estimate of Geological Time._--It is not of course\r\nsupposed that the calculation here given {114} makes any approach to\r\naccuracy, but it is believed that it does indicate the _order_ of magnitude\r\nof the time required. We have a certain number of data, which are not\r\nguessed but the result of actual measurement; such are, the amount of solid\r\nmatter carried down by rivers, the width of the belt within which this\r\nmatter is mainly deposited, and the maximum thickness of the known\r\nstratified rocks.[45] A considerable but unknown amount of denudation is\r\neffected by the waves of the ocean eating away coast lines. This was once\r\nthought to be of more importance than sub-aerial denudation, but it is now\r\nbelieved to be comparatively slow in its action.[46] Whatever it may be,\r\nhowever, it adds to the rate of formation of new strata, and its omission\r\nfrom the calculation is again on the side of making the lapse of time\r\ngreater rather than less than the true amount. Even if a considerable\r\nmodification should be needed in some of the assumptions it has been\r\nnecessary to make, the result must still show that, so far as the time\r\nrequired for the formation of the known stratified rocks, the hundred\r\nmillion years allowed by physicists is not only ample, but will permit of\r\neven more than an equal period anterior to the lowest Cambrian rocks, as\r\ndemanded by Mr. Darwin--a demand supported and enforced by the arguments,\r\ntaken from independent standpoints, of Professor Huxley and Professor\r\nRamsay.\r\n\r\n_Organic Modification Dependent on Change of Conditions._--Having {115}\r\nthus shown that the physical changes of the earth's surface may have gone\r\non much more rapidly and occupied much less time than has generally been\r\nsupposed, we have now to inquire whether there are any considerations which\r\nlead to the conclusion that organic changes may have gone on with\r\ncorresponding rapidity.\r\n\r\nThere is no part of the theory of natural selection which is more clear and\r\nsatisfactory than that which connects changes of specific forms with\r\nchanges of external conditions or environment. If the external world\r\nremains for a moderate period unchanged, the organic world soon reaches a\r\nstate of equilibrium through the struggle for existence; each species\r\noccupies its place in nature, and there is then no inherent tendency to\r\nchange. But almost any change whatever in the external world disturbs this\r\nequilibrium, and may set in motion a whole series of organic revolutions\r\nbefore it is restored. A change of climate in any direction will be sure to\r\ninjure some and benefit other species. The one will consequently diminish,\r\nthe other increase in number; and the former may even become extinct. But\r\nthe extinction of a species will certainly affect other species which it\r\neither preyed upon, or competed with, or served for food; while the\r\nincrease of any one animal may soon lead to the extinction of some other to\r\nwhich it was inimical. These changes will in their turn bring other\r\nchanges; and before an equilibrium is again established, the proportions,\r\nranges, and numbers, of the species inhabiting the country may be\r\nmaterially altered. The complex manner in which animals are related to each\r\nother is well exhibited by the importance of insects, which in many parts\r\nof the world limit the numbers or determine the very existence of some of\r\nthe higher animals. Mr. Darwin says:--\"Perhaps Paraguay offers the most\r\ncurious instance of this; for here neither cattle, nor horses, nor dogs\r\nhave ever run wild, though they swarm southward and northward in a wild\r\nstate; and Azara and Rengger have shown that this is caused by the greater\r\nnumber in Paraguay of a certain fly, which lays its eggs in the navels of\r\nthese animals when first born. The increase of these flies, numerous as\r\nthey are, must be {116} habitually checked by some means, probably by other\r\nparasitic insects. Hence, if certain insectivorous birds were to decrease\r\nin Paraguay, the parasitic insects would probably increase; and this would\r\nlessen the number of navel-frequenting flies--then cattle and horses would\r\nrun wild; and this would certainly alter (as indeed I have observed in\r\nparts of South America) the vegetation: this again would largely affect the\r\ninsects, and this, as we have seen in Staffordshire, the insectivorous\r\nbirds, and so onwards in ever increasing circles of complexity.\"\r\n\r\nGeographical changes would be still more important, and it is almost\r\nimpossible to exaggerate the modifications of the organic world that might\r\nresult from them. A subsidence of land separating a large island from a\r\ncontinent would affect the animals and plants in a variety of ways. It\r\nwould at once modify the climate, and so produce a series of changes from\r\nthis cause alone; but more important would be its effect by isolating small\r\ngroups of individuals of many species and thus altering their relations to\r\nthe rest of the organic world. Many of these would at once be exterminated,\r\nwhile others, being relieved from competition, might flourish and become\r\nmodified into new species. Even more striking would be the effects when two\r\ncontinents, or any two land areas which had been long separated, were\r\nunited by an upheaval of the strait which divided them. Numbers of animals\r\nwould now be brought into competition for the first time. New enemies and\r\nnew competitors would appear in every part of the country; and a struggle\r\nwould commence which, after many fluctuations, would certainly result in\r\nthe extinction of some species, the modification of others, and a\r\nconsiderable alteration in the proportionate numbers and the geographical\r\ndistribution of almost all.\r\n\r\nAny other changes which led to the intermingling of species whose ranges\r\nwere usually separate would produce corresponding results. Thus, increased\r\nseverity of winter or summer temperature, causing southward migrations and\r\nthe crowding together of the productions of distinct regions, must\r\ninevitably produce a struggle for existence, which would lead to many\r\nchanges both in the characters and {117} the distribution of animals. Slow\r\nelevations of the land would produce another set of changes, by affording\r\nan extended area in which the more dominant species might increase their\r\nnumbers; and by a greater range and variety of alpine climates and mountain\r\nstations, affording room for the development of new forms of life.\r\n\r\n_Geographical Mutations as a Motive Power in Bringing about Organic\r\nChanges._--Now, if we consider the various geographical changes which, as\r\nwe have seen, there is good reason to believe have ever been going on in\r\nthe world, we shall find that the motive power to initiate and urge on\r\norganic changes has never been wanting. In the first place, every\r\ncontinent, though permanent in a general sense, has been ever subject to\r\ninnumerable physical and geographical modifications. At one time the total\r\narea has increased, and at another has diminished; great plateaus have\r\ngradually risen up, and have been eaten out by denudation into mountain and\r\nvalley; volcanoes have burst forth, and, after accumulating vast masses of\r\neruptive matter, have sunk down beneath the ocean, to be covered up with\r\nsedimentary rocks, and at a subsequent period again raised above the\r\nsurface; and the _loci_ of all these grand revolutions of the earth's\r\nsurface have changed their position age after age, so that each portion of\r\nevery continent has again and again been sunk under the ocean waves, formed\r\nthe bed of some inland sea, or risen high into plateaus and mountain\r\nranges. How great must have been the effects of such changes on every form\r\nof organic life! And it is to such as these we may perhaps trace those\r\ngreat changes of the animal world which have seemed to revolutionise it,\r\nand have led us to class one geological period as the age of reptiles,\r\nanother as the age of fishes, and a third as the age of mammals.\r\n\r\nBut such changes as these must necessarily have led to repeated unions and\r\nseparations of the land masses of the globe, joining together continents\r\nwhich were before divided, and breaking up others into great islands or\r\nextensive archipelagoes. Such alterations of the means of transit would\r\nprobably affect the organic world even more profoundly than the changes of\r\narea, of altitude, or {118} of climate, since they afforded the means, at\r\nlong intervals, of bringing the most diverse forms into competition, and of\r\nspreading all the great animal and vegetable types widely over the globe.\r\nBut the isolation of considerable masses of land for long periods also\r\nafforded the means of preservation to many of the lower types, which thus\r\nhad time to become modified into a variety of distinct forms, some of which\r\nbecame so well adapted to special modes of life that they have continued to\r\nexist to the present day, thus affording us examples of the life of early\r\nages which would probably long since have become extinct had they been\r\nalways subject to the competition of the more highly organised animals. As\r\nexamples of such excessively archaic forms, we may mention the mud-fishes\r\nand the ganoids, confined to limited fresh-water areas; the frogs and\r\ntoads, which still maintain themselves vigorously in competition with\r\nhigher forms; and among mammals the Ornithorhynchus and Echidna of\r\nAustralia; the whole order of Marsupials--which, out of Australia, where\r\nthey are quite free from competition, only exist abundantly in South\r\nAmerica, which was certainly long isolated from the northern continents;\r\nthe Insectivora, which, though widely scattered, are generally nocturnal or\r\nsubterranean in their habits; and the Lemurs, which are most abundant in\r\nMadagascar, where they have long been isolated, and almost removed from the\r\ncompetition of higher forms.\r\n\r\n_Climatal Revolutions as an Agent in Producing Organic Changes._--The\r\ngeographical and geological changes we have been considering are probably\r\nthose which have been most effective in bringing about the great features\r\nof the distribution of animals, as well as the larger movements in the\r\ndevelopment of organised beings; but it is to the alternations of warm and\r\ncold, or of uniform and excessive climates--of almost perpetual spring in\r\narctic as well as in temperate lands, with occasional phases of cold\r\nculminating at remote intervals in glacial epochs,--that we must impute\r\nsome of the more remarkable changes both in the specific characters and in\r\nthe distribution of organisms.[47] {119} Although the geological evidence\r\nis opposed to the belief in early glacial epochs except at very remote and\r\ndistant intervals, there is nothing which contradicts the occurrence of\r\nrepeated changes of climate, which, though too small in amount to produce\r\nany well-marked physical or organic change, would yet be amply sufficient\r\nto keep the organic world in a constant state of movement, and which, by\r\nsubjecting the whole flora and fauna of a country at comparatively short\r\nintervals to decided changes of physical conditions, would supply that\r\nstimulus and motive power which, as we have seen, is all that is necessary\r\nto keep the processes of \"natural selection\" in constant operation.\r\n\r\nThe frequent recurrence of periods of high and of low excentricity must\r\ncertainly have produced changes of climate of considerable importance to\r\nthe life of animals and plants. During periods of high excentricity with\r\nsummer in _perihelion_, that season would be certainly very much hotter,\r\nwhile the winters would be longer and colder than at present; and although\r\ngeographical conditions might prevent any permanent increase of snow and\r\nice even in the extreme north, yet we cannot doubt that the whole northern\r\nhemisphere would then have a very different climate than when the changing\r\nphase of precession brought a very cool summer and a very mild winter--a\r\nperpetual spring, in fact. Now, such a change of climate would certainly be\r\ncalculated to bring about a considerable change of _species_, both by\r\nmodification and migration, without any such decided change of _type_\r\neither in the vegetation or the animals that we could say from their fossil\r\nremains that any change of climate had taken place. Let us suppose, for\r\ninstance, that the climate of England and that of Canada were to be\r\nmutually exchanged, and that the change took five or six thousand years to\r\nbring about, it cannot be doubted that considerable modifications in the\r\nfauna and flora of both countries would be the result, although it is\r\nimpossible to predict {120} what the precise changes would be. We can\r\nsafely say, however, that some species would stand the change better than\r\nothers, while it is highly probable that some would be actually benefited\r\nby it, and that others would be injured. But the benefited would certainly\r\nincrease, and the injured decrease, in consequence, and thus a series of\r\nchanges would be initiated that might lead to most important results.\r\nAgain, we are sure that some species would become modified in adaptation to\r\nthe change of climate more readily than others, and these modified species\r\nwould therefore increase at the expense of others not so readily modified;\r\nand hence would arise on the one hand extinction of species, and on the\r\nother the production of new forms.\r\n\r\nBut this is the very least amount of change of climate that would certainly\r\noccur every 10,500 years when there was a high excentricity, for it is\r\nimpossible to doubt that a varying distance of the sun in summer from 86 to\r\n99 millions of miles (which is what occurred during--as supposed--the\r\nMiocene period, 850,000 years ago) would produce an important difference in\r\nthe summer temperature and in the actinic influence of sunshine on\r\nvegetation. For the intensity of the sun's rays would vary as the square of\r\nthe distance, or nearly as 74 to 98, so that the earth would be actually\r\nreceiving one-fourth less sun-heat during summer at one time than at the\r\nother. An equally high excentricity occurred 2,500,000 years back, and no\r\ndoubt was often reached during still earlier epochs, while a lower but\r\nstill very high excentricity has frequently prevailed, and is probably near\r\nits average value. Changes of climate, therefore, every 10,500 years, of\r\nthe character above indicated and of varying intensity, have been the rule\r\nrather than the exception in past time; and these changes must have been\r\nvariously modified by changing geographical conditions so as to produce\r\nclimatic alterations in different directions, giving to the ancient lands\r\neither dry or wet seasons, storms or calms, equable or excessive\r\ntemperatures, in a variety of combinations of which the earth perhaps\r\naffords no example under the present low phase of {121} excentricity and\r\nconsequent slight inequality of sun-heat.\r\n\r\n_Present Condition of the Earth One of Exceptional Stability as Regards\r\nClimate._--It will be seen, by a reference to the diagram at page 171, that\r\nduring the last three million years the excentricity has been _less_ than\r\nit is now on eight occasions, for short periods only, making up a total of\r\nabout 280,000 years; while it has been _more_ than it is now for many long\r\nperiods, of from 300,000 to 700,000 years each, making a total of 2,720,000\r\nyears; or nearly as 10 to 1. For nearly half the entire period, or\r\n1,400,000 years, the excentricity has been nearly double what it is now,\r\nand this is not far from its mean condition. We have no reason for\r\nsupposing that this long period of three million years, for which we have\r\ntables, was in any way exceptional as regards the degree or variation of\r\nexcentricity; but, on the contrary, we may pretty safely assume that its\r\nvariations during this time fairly represent its average state of increase\r\nand decrease during all known geological time. But when the glacial epoch\r\nended, 72,000 years ago, the excentricity was about double its present\r\namount; it then rapidly decreased till, at 60,000 years back, it was very\r\nlittle greater than it is now, and since then it has been uniformly small.\r\nIt follows that, for about 60,000 years before our time, the mutations of\r\nclimate every 10,500 years have been comparatively unimportant, and that\r\nthe temperate zones have enjoyed _an exceptional stability of climate_.\r\nDuring this time those powerful causes of organic change which depend on\r\nconsiderable changes of climate and the consequent modifications,\r\nmigrations, and extinctions of species, will not have been at work; the\r\nslight changes that did occur would probably be so slow and so little\r\nmarked that the various species would be able to adapt themselves to them\r\nwithout much disturbance; and the result would be _an epoch of exceptional\r\nstability of species_.\r\n\r\nBut it is from this very period of _exceptional stability_ that we obtain\r\nour only _scale_ for measuring the rate of organic change. It includes not\r\nonly the historical period, {122} but that of the Swiss Lake dwellings, the\r\nDanish shell-mounds, our peat-bogs, our sunken forests, and many of our\r\nsuperficial alluvial deposits--the whole in fact, of the iron, bronze, and\r\nneolithic ages. Even some portion of the palaeolithic age, and of the more\r\nrecent gravels and cave-earths may come into the same general period if\r\nthey were formed when the glacial epoch was passing away. Now throughout\r\nall these ages we find no indication of change of species, and but little,\r\ncomparatively, of migration. We thus get an erroneous idea of _the\r\npermanence and stability of specific forms_, due to the period immediately\r\nantecedent to our own being a _period of exceptional permanence and\r\nstability_ as regards climatic and geographical conditions.[48]\r\n\r\n_Date of Last Glacial Epoch and its Bearing on the Measurement of\r\nGeological Time._--Directly we go back from this stable period we come upon\r\nchanges both in the forms and in the distribution of species; and when we\r\npass beyond the last glacial epoch into the Pliocene period we find\r\nourselves in a comparatively new world, surrounded by a considerable number\r\nof species altogether different from any which now exist, together with\r\nmany others which, though still living, now inhabit distant regions. It\r\nseems not improbable that what is termed the Pliocene period, was really\r\nthe coming on of the glacial epoch, and this is the opinion of Professor\r\nJules Marcou.[49] According to our views, a considerable amount of\r\ngeographical change must have occurred at the change from the Miocene to\r\nthe Pliocene, favouring the refrigeration of the northern hemisphere, and\r\nleading, in the way already pointed out, to the glacial epoch whenever a\r\nhigh degree of excentricity {123} prevailed. As many reasons combine to\r\nmake us fix the height of the glacial epoch at the period of high\r\nexcentricity which occurred 200,000 years back, and as the Pliocene period\r\nwas probably not of long duration, we must suppose the next great phase of\r\nvery high excentricity (850,000 years ago) to fall within the Miocene\r\nepoch. Dr. Croll believes that this must have produced a glacial period,\r\nbut we have shown strong reasons for believing that, in concurrence with\r\nfavourable geographical conditions, it led to uninterrupted warm climates\r\nin the temperate and northern zones. This, however, did not prevent the\r\noccurrence of local glaciation wherever other conditions led to its\r\ninitiation, and the most powerful of such conditions is a great extent of\r\nhigh land. Now we know that the Alps acquired a considerable part of their\r\nelevation during the latter part of the Miocene period, since Miocene rocks\r\noccur at an elevation of over 6,000 feet, while Eocene beds occur at nearly\r\n10,000 feet. But since that time there has been a vast amount of\r\ndenudation, so that these rocks may have been at first raised much higher\r\nthan we now find them, and thus a considerable portion of the Alps may have\r\nbeen more elevated than they are now. This would certainly lead to an\r\nenormous accumulation of snow, which would be increased when the\r\nexcentricity reached a maximum, as already fully explained, and may then\r\nhave caused glaciers to descend into the adjacent sea, carrying those\r\nenormous masses of rock which are buried in the Upper Miocene of the\r\nSuperga in Northern Italy. An earlier epoch of great altitude in the Alps\r\ncoinciding with the very high excentricity 2,500,000 years ago, may have\r\ncaused the local glaciation of the Middle Eocene period when the enormous\r\nerratics of the Flysch conglomerate were deposited in the inland seas of\r\nNorthern Switzerland, the Carpathians, and the Apennines. This is quite in\r\nharmony with the indications of an uninterrupted warm climate and rich\r\nvegetation during the very same period in the adjacent low countries, just\r\nas we find at the present day in New Zealand a delightful climate and a\r\nrich vegetation of Metrosideros, {124} fuchsias and tree-ferns on the very\r\nborders of huge glaciers, descending to within 700 feet of the sea-level.\r\nIt is not pretended that these estimates of geological time have any more\r\nvalue than probable guesses; but it is certainly a curious coincidence that\r\ntwo remarkable periods of high excentricity should have occurred, at such\r\nperiods and at such intervals apart, as very well accord with the\r\ncomparative remoteness of the two deposits in which undoubted signs of\r\nice-action have been found, and that both these are localised in the\r\nvicinity of mountains which are known to have acquired a considerable\r\nelevation at about the same period of time.\r\n\r\nIn the tenth edition of the _Principles of Geology_, Sir Charles Lyell,\r\ntaking the amount of change in the species of mollusca as a guide,\r\nestimated the time elapsed since the commencement of the Miocene as\r\none-third that of the whole Tertiary epoch, and the latter at one-fourth\r\nthat of geological time since the Cambrian period. Professor Dana, on the\r\nother hand, estimates the Tertiary as only one-fifteenth of the Mesozoic\r\nand Palaeozoic combined. On the estimate above given, founded on the dates\r\nof phases of high excentricity, we shall arrive at about four million years\r\nfor the Tertiary epoch, and sixteen million years for the time elapsed\r\nsince the Cambrian, according to Lyell, or sixty millions according to\r\nDana. The estimate arrived at from the rate of denudation and deposition\r\n(twenty-eight million years) is nearly midway between these, and it is, at\r\nall events, satisfactory that the various measures result in figures of the\r\nsame order of magnitude, which is all one can expect when discussing so\r\ndifficult and exceedingly speculative a subject.\r\n\r\nThe only value of such estimates is to define our notions of geological\r\ntime, and to show that the enormous periods, of hundreds of millions of\r\nyears, which have sometimes been indicated by geologists, are neither\r\nnecessary nor warranted by the facts at our command; while the present\r\nresult places us more in harmony with the calculations of physicists, by\r\nleaving a very wide margin between geological time as defined by the\r\nfossiliferous rocks, and that {125} far more extensive period which\r\nincludes all possibility of life upon the earth.\r\n\r\n_Concluding Remarks._--In the present chapter I have endeavoured to show\r\nthat, combining the measured rate of denudation with the estimated\r\nthickness and probable extent of the known series of sedimentary rocks, we\r\nmay arrive at a rude estimate of the time occupied in the formation of\r\nthose rocks. From another point of departure--that of the probable date of\r\nthe Miocene period, as determined by the epoch of high excentricity\r\nsupposed to have aided in the production of the Alpine glaciation during\r\nthat period, and taking the estimate of geologists as to the proportionate\r\namount of change in the animal world since that epoch--we obtain another\r\nestimate of the duration of geological time, which, though founded on far\r\nless secure data, agrees pretty nearly with the former estimate. The time\r\nthus arrived at is immensely less than the usual estimates of geologists,\r\nand is so far within the limits of the duration of the earth as calculated\r\nby Sir William Thomson, as to allow for the development of the lower\r\norganisms an amount of time anterior to the Cambrian period several times\r\ngreater than has elapsed between that period and the present day. I have\r\nfurther shown that, in the continued mutations of climate produced by high\r\nexcentricity and opposite phases of precession, even though these did not\r\nlead to glacial epochs, we have a motive power well calculated to produce\r\nfar more rapid organic changes than have hitherto been thought possible;\r\nwhile in the enormous amount of specific variation (as demonstrated in an\r\nearlier chapter), we have ample material for that power to act upon, so as\r\nto keep the organic world in a state of rapid change and development\r\nproportioned to the comparatively rapid changes in the earth's surface.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have now finished the series of preliminary studies of the biological\r\nconditions and physical changes which have affected the modification and\r\ndispersal of organisms, and have thus brought about their actual\r\ndistribution on {126} the surface of the earth. These studies will, it is\r\nbelieved, place us in a condition to solve most of the problems presented\r\nby the distribution of animals and plants, whenever the necessary facts,\r\nboth as to their distribution and their affinities, are sufficiently well\r\nknown; and we now proceed to apply the principles we have established to\r\nthe interpretation of the phenomena presented by some of the more important\r\nand best known of the islands of our globe, limiting ourselves to these for\r\nreasons which have been already sufficiently explained in our preface.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II\r\n\r\n_INSULAR FAUNAS AND FLORAS_\r\n\r\n{241}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTHE CLASSIFICATION OF ISLANDS\r\n\r\n    Importance of Islands in the Study of the Distribution of\r\n    Organisms--Classification of Islands with Reference to\r\n    Distribution--Continental Islands--Oceanic Islands.\r\n\r\nIn the preceding chapters, forming the first part of our work, we have\r\ndiscussed, more or less fully, the general features presented by animal\r\ndistribution, as well as the various physical and biological changes which\r\nhave been the most important agents in bringing about the present condition\r\nof the organic world.\r\n\r\nWe now proceed to apply these principles to the solution of the numerous\r\nproblems presented by the distribution of animals; and in order to limit\r\nthe field of our inquiry, and at the same time to deal only with such facts\r\nas may be rendered intelligible and interesting to those readers who have\r\nnot much acquaintance with the details of natural history, we propose to\r\nconsider only such phenomena as are presented by the islands of the globe.\r\n\r\n_Importance of Islands in the Study of the Distribution of\r\nOrganisms._--Islands possess many advantages for the study of the laws and\r\nphenomena of distribution. As compared with continents they have a\r\nrestricted area and definite boundaries, and in most cases their\r\ngeographical and biological limits coincide. The number of species and of\r\ngenera they contain is always much smaller than in the {242} case of\r\ncontinents, and their peculiar species and groups are usually well defined\r\nand strictly limited in range. Again, their relations with other lands are\r\noften direct and simple, and even when more complex are far easier to\r\ncomprehend than those of continents; and they exhibit besides certain\r\ninfluences on the forms of life and certain peculiarities in their\r\ndistribution which continents do not present, and whose study offers many\r\npoints of interest.\r\n\r\nIn islands we have the facts of distribution presented to us, sometimes in\r\ntheir simplest forms, in other cases becoming gradually more and more\r\ncomplex; and we are therefore able to proceed step by step in the solution\r\nof the problems they present. But as in studying these problems we have\r\nnecessarily to take into account the relations of the insular and\r\ncontinental faunas, we also get some knowledge of the latter, and acquire\r\nbesides so much command over the general principles which underlie all\r\nproblems of distribution, that it is not too much to say that when we have\r\nmastered the difficulties presented by the peculiarities of island life we\r\nshall find it comparatively easy to deal with the more complex and less\r\nclearly defined problems of continental distribution.\r\n\r\n_Classification of Islands with Reference to Distribution._--Islands have\r\nhad two distinct modes of origin--they have either been separated from\r\ncontinents of which they are but detached fragments, or they have\r\noriginated in the ocean and have never formed part of a continent or any\r\nlarge mass of land. This difference of origin is fundamental, and leads to\r\na most important difference in their animal inhabitants; and we may\r\ntherefore first distinguish the two classes--oceanic and continental\r\nislands.\r\n\r\nMr. Darwin appears to have been the first writer who called attention to\r\nthe number and importance, both from a geological and biological point of\r\nview, of oceanic islands. He showed that with very few exceptions all the\r\nremoter islands of the great oceans were of volcanic or coralline\r\nformation, and that none of them contained indigenous mammalia or amphibia.\r\nHe also showed the connection of these two phenomena, and maintained that\r\nnone of the islands so characterised had ever formed {243} part of a\r\ncontinent. This was quite opposed to the opinions of the scientific men of\r\nthe day, who almost all held the idea of continental extensions, and of\r\noceanic islands being their fragments, and it was long before Mr. Darwin's\r\nviews obtained general acceptance. Even now the belief still lingers; and\r\nwe continually hear of old Atlantic or Pacific continents, of \"Atlantis\" or\r\n\"Lemuria,\" of which hypothetical lands many existing islands, although\r\nwholly volcanic, are thought to be the remnants. We have already seen that\r\nDarwin connected the peculiar geological structure of oceanic islands with\r\nthe permanence of the great oceans which contain them, and we have shown\r\nthat several distinct lines of evidence all point to the same conclusion.\r\nWe may therefore define oceanic islands, as follows:--Islands of volcanic\r\nor coralline formation, usually far from continents and always separated\r\nfrom them by very deep sea, entirely without indigenous land mammalia or\r\namphibia, but with a fair number of birds and insects, and usually with\r\nsome reptiles. This definition will exclude only two islands which have\r\nbeen sometimes classed as oceanic--New Zealand and the Seychelles.\r\nRodriguez, which was once thought to be another exception, has been shown\r\nby the explorations during the Transit of Venus Expedition to be\r\nessentially volcanic, with some upraised coralline limestone.\r\n\r\n_Continental Islands._--Continental islands are always more varied in their\r\ngeological formation, containing both ancient and recent stratified rocks.\r\nThey are rarely very remote from a continent, and they always contain some\r\nland mammals and amphibia, as well as representatives of the other classes\r\nand orders in considerable variety. They may, however, be divided into two\r\nwell-marked groups--ancient and recent continental islands--the characters\r\nof which may be easily defined.\r\n\r\nRecent continental islands are always situated on submerged banks\r\nconnecting them with a continent, and the depth of the intervening sea\r\nrarely exceeds 100 fathoms. They resemble the continent in their geological\r\nstructure, while their animal and vegetable productions are either almost\r\nidentical with those of the continent, or if {244} otherwise, the\r\ndifference consists in the presence of closely allied species of the same\r\ntypes, with occasionally a very few peculiar genera. They possess in fact\r\nall the characteristics of a portion of the continent, separated from it at\r\na recent geological period.\r\n\r\nAncient continental islands differ greatly from the preceding in many\r\nrespects. They are not united to the adjacent continent by a shallow bank,\r\nbut are usually separated from it by a depth of sea of several hundreds to\r\nmore than a thousand fathoms. In geological structure they agree generally\r\nwith the more recent islands; like them they possess mammalia and amphibia,\r\nusually in considerable abundance, as well as all other classes of animals;\r\nbut these are highly peculiar, almost all being distinct species, and many\r\nforming distinct and peculiar genera or families. They are also well\r\ncharacterised by the fragmentary nature of their fauna, many of the most\r\ncharacteristic continental orders or families being quite unrepresented,\r\nwhile some of their animals are allied, not to such forms as inhabit the\r\nadjacent continent, but to others found only in remote parts of the world.\r\nThis very remarkable set of characters marks off the islands which exhibit\r\nthem as a distinct class, which often present the greatest anomalies and\r\nmost difficult problems to the student of distribution.\r\n\r\n_Oceanic Islands._--The total absence of warm-blooded terrestrial animals\r\nin an island otherwise well suited to maintain them, is held to prove that\r\nsuch island is no mere fragment of any existing or submerged continent, but\r\none that has been actually produced in mid-ocean. It is true that if a\r\ncontinental island were to be completely submerged for a single day and\r\nthen again elevated, its higher terrestrial animals would be all destroyed,\r\nand if it were situated at a considerable distance from land it would be\r\nreduced to the same zoological condition as an oceanic island. But such a\r\ncomplete submergence and re-elevation appears never to have taken place,\r\nfor there is no single island on the globe which has the physical and\r\ngeological features of a continental, combined with the zoological features\r\nof an oceanic island. It is true that some of the coral-islands may be\r\nformed upon submerged lands {245} of a continental character, but we have\r\nno proof of this; and even if it were so, the existing islands are to all\r\nintents and purposes oceanic.\r\n\r\nWe will now pass on to a consideration of some of the more interesting\r\nexamples of these three classes, beginning with oceanic islands.\r\n\r\nAll the animals which now inhabit such oceanic islands must either\r\nthemselves have reached them by crossing the ocean, or be the descendants\r\nof ancestors who did so. Let us then see what are, in fact, the animal and\r\nvegetable inhabitants of these islands, and how far their presence can be\r\naccounted for. We will begin with the Azores, or Western Islands, because\r\nthey have been thoroughly well explored by naturalists, and in their\r\npeculiarities afford us an important clue to some of the most efficient\r\nmeans of distribution among several classes of animals.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{246}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nOCEANIC ISLANDS:--THE AZORES AND BERMUDA\r\n\r\nTHE AZORES, OR WESTERN ISLANDS\r\n\r\n    Position and Physical Features--Chief Zoological Features of the\r\n    Azores--Birds--Origin of the Azorean Bird Fauna--Insects of the\r\n    Azores--Land-Shells of the Azores--The Flora of the Azores--The\r\n    Dispersal of Seeds--Birds as Seed-Carriers--Facilities for Dispersal of\r\n    Azorean Plants--Important Deduction from the Peculiarities of the\r\n    Azorean Fauna and Flora.\r\n\r\nBERMUDA\r\n\r\n    Position and Physical Features--The Red Clay of Bermuda--Zoology of\r\n    Bermuda--Birds of Bermuda--Comparison of the Bird Faunas of Bermuda and\r\n    the Azores--Insects of Bermuda--Land Mollusca--Flora of\r\n    Bermuda--Concluding Remarks on the Azores and Bermuda.\r\n\r\nWe will commence our investigation into the phenomena presented by oceanic\r\nislands, with two groups of the North Atlantic, in which the facts are of a\r\ncomparatively simple nature and such as to afford us a valuable clue to a\r\nsolution of the more difficult problems we shall have to deal with further\r\non. The Azores and Bermuda offer great contrasts in physical features, but\r\nstriking similarities in geographical position. The one is volcanic, the\r\nother coralline; but both are surrounded by a wide expanse of ocean of\r\nenormous depth, the one being about as far from Europe as the other is from\r\nAmerica. Both are situated in the {247} temperate zone, and they differ\r\nless than six degrees in latitude, yet the vegetation of the one is wholly\r\ntemperate, while that of the other is almost tropical. The productions of\r\nthe one are related to Europe, as those of the other are to America, but\r\nthey present instructive differences; and both afford evidence of the\r\nhighest value as to the means of dispersal of various groups of organisms\r\nacross a wide expanse of ocean.\r\n\r\nTHE AZORES, OR WESTERN ISLANDS.\r\n\r\nThese islands, nine in number, form a widely scattered group, situated\r\nbetween 37deg and 39deg 40' N. Lat. and stretching in a south-east and\r\nnorth-west direction over a distance of nearly 400 miles. The largest of\r\nthe islands, San Miguel, is about forty miles long, and is one of the\r\nnearest to Europe, being rather under 900 miles from the coast of Portugal,\r\nfrom which it is separated by an ocean 2,500 fathoms deep. The depth\r\nbetween the islands does not seem to be known, but the 1,000 fathom line\r\nencloses the whole group pretty closely, while a depth of about 1,800\r\nfathoms is reached within 300 miles in all directions. These great depths\r\nrender it in the highest degree improbable that the Azores have ever been\r\nunited with the European continent; while their being wholly volcanic is\r\nequally opposed to the view of their having formed part of an extensive\r\nAtlantis including Madeira and the Canaries. The only exception to their\r\nvolcanic structure is the occurrence in one small island only (Santa Maria)\r\nof some marine deposits of Upper Miocene age--a fact which proves some\r\nalterations of level, and perhaps a greater extension of this island at\r\nsome former period, but in no way indicates a former union of the islands,\r\nor any greater extension of the whole group. It proves, however, that the\r\ngroup is of considerable antiquity, since it must date back to Miocene\r\ntimes; and this fact may be of importance in considering the origin and\r\npeculiar features of the fauna and flora. It thus appears that in all\r\nphysical features the Azores correspond strictly with our physical\r\ndefinition of \"oceanic islands,\" while their great distance {248} from any\r\nother land, and the depth of the ocean around them, make them typical\r\nexamples of the class. We should therefore expect them to be equally\r\ntypical in their fauna and flora; and this is the case as regards the most\r\nimportant characteristics, although in some points of detail they present\r\nexceptional phenomena.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OUTLINE MAP OF THE AZORES.]\r\n\r\n  NOTE.--\r\n  The light tint shows where the sea is less than 1,000 fathoms deep.\r\n  The dark tint    \"     \"        \"     more than 1,000 fathoms deep.\r\n  The figures show depths in fathoms.\r\n\r\n_Chief Zoological Features of the Azores._[50]--The great feature of\r\noceanic islands--the absence of all indigenous land-mammalia and\r\namphibia--is well shown in this {249} group; and it is even carried\r\nfurther, so as to include all terrestrial vertebrata, there being no snake,\r\nlizard, frog, or fresh-water fish, although the islands are sufficiently\r\nextensive, possess a mild and equable climate, and are in every way adapted\r\nto support all these groups. On the other hand, flying creatures, as birds\r\nand insects, are abundant; and there is also one flying mammal--a small\r\nEuropean bat. It is true that rabbits, weasels, rats and mice, and a small\r\nlizard peculiar to Madeira and Teneriffe, are now found wild in the Azores,\r\nbut there is good reason to believe that these have all been introduced by\r\nhuman agency. The same may be said of the gold-fish and eels now found in\r\nsome of the lakes, there being not a single fresh-water fish which is truly\r\nindigenous to the islands. When we consider that the nearest part of the\r\ngroup is about 900 miles from Portugal, and more than 550 miles from\r\nMadeira, it is not surprising that none of these terrestrial animals can\r\nhave passed over such a wide expanse of ocean unassisted by man.\r\n\r\nLet us now see what animals are believed to have reached the group by\r\nnatural means, and thus constitute its indigenous fauna. These consist of\r\nbirds, insects, and land-shells, each of which must be considered\r\nseparately.\r\n\r\n_Birds._--Fifty-three species of birds have been observed at the Azores,\r\nbut the larger proportion (thirty-one) are either aquatic or waders--birds\r\nof great powers of flight, whose presence in the remotest islands is by no\r\nmeans remarkable. Of these two groups twenty are residents, breeding in the\r\nislands, while eleven are stragglers only visiting the islands\r\noccasionally, and all are common European species. The land-birds,\r\ntwenty-two in number, are more interesting, four only being stragglers,\r\nwhile eighteen are permanent residents. The following is a list of these\r\nresident land-birds:--\r\n\r\n   1. Common Buzzard            (_Buteo vulgaris_)\r\n   2. Long-eared Owl            (_Asio otus_)\r\n   3. Barn Owl                  (_Strix flammea_)\r\n   4. Blackbird                 (_Turdus merula_)\r\n   5. Robin                     (_Erythacus rubecula_)\r\n   6. Blackcap                  (_Sylvia atricapilla_)\r\n  {250}\r\n   7. Gold-crest                (_Regulus cristatus_)\r\n   8. Wheatear                  (_Saxicola oenanthe_)\r\n   9. Grey Wagtail              (_Motacilla sulphurea_)\r\n  10. Atlantic Chaffinch        (_Fringilla tintillon_)\r\n  11. Azorean Bullfinch         (_Pyrrhula murina_)\r\n  12. Canary                    (_Serinus canarius_)\r\n  13. Common Starling           (_Sturnus vulgaris_)\r\n  14. Lesser Spotted Woodpecker (_Dryobates minor_)\r\n  15. Wood-pigeon               (_Columba palumbus_)\r\n  16. Rock Dove                 (_Columba livia_)\r\n  17. Red-legged Partridge      (_Caccabis rufa_)\r\n  18. Common Quail              (_Coturnix communis_)\r\n\r\nAll the above-named birds are common in Europe and North Africa except\r\nthree--the Atlantic chaffinch and the canary which inhabit Madeira and the\r\nCanary Islands, and the Azorean bullfinch, which is peculiar to the islands\r\nwe are considering.\r\n\r\n_Origin of the Azorean Bird-fauna._--The questions we have now before us\r\nare--how did these eighteen species of birds first reach the Azores, and\r\nhow are we to explain the presence of a single peculiar species while all\r\nthe rest are identical with European birds? In order to answer them, let us\r\nfirst see what stragglers now actually visit the Azores from the nearest\r\ncontinents. The four species given in Mr. Godman's list are the kestrel,\r\nthe oriole, the snow-bunting, and the hoopoe; but he also tells us that\r\nthere are certainly others, and adds: \"Scarcely a storm occurs in spring or\r\nautumn without bringing one or more species foreign to the islands; and I\r\nhave frequently been told that swallows, larks, grebes, and other species\r\nnot referred to here, are not uncommonly seen at those seasons of the\r\nyear.\"\r\n\r\nWe have, therefore, every reason to believe that the birds which are now\r\nresidents originated as stragglers, which occasionally found a haven in\r\nthese remote islands when driven out to sea by storms. Some of them, no\r\ndoubt, still often arrive from the continent, but these cannot easily be\r\ndistinguished as new arrivals among those which are permanent inhabitants.\r\nMany facts mentioned by Mr. Godman show that this is the case. A barn-owl,\r\nmuch exhausted, flew on board a whaling-ship when 500 miles S.W. of the\r\nAzores; and even if it had come from {251} Madeira it must have travelled\r\nquite as far as from Portugal to the islands. Mr. Godman also shot a single\r\nspecimen of the wheatear in Flores after a strong gale of wind, and as no\r\none on the island knew the bird, it was almost certainly a recent arrival.\r\nSubsequently a few were found breeding in the old crater of Corvo, a small\r\nadjacent island; and as the species is not found in any other island of the\r\ngroup, we may infer that this bird is a recent immigrant in process of\r\nestablishing itself.\r\n\r\nAnother fact which is almost conclusive in favour of the bird-population\r\nhaving arrived as stragglers is, that they are most abundant in the islands\r\nnearest to Europe and Africa. The Azores consist of three divisions--an\r\neastern, consisting of two islands, St. Michael's and St. Mary's; a central\r\nof five, Terceira, Graciosa, St. George's, Pico, and Fayal; and a western\r\nof two, Flores and Corvo. Now had the whole group once been united to the\r\ncontinent, or even formed parts of one extensive Atlantic island, we should\r\ncertainly expect the central group, which is more compact and has a much\r\nlarger area than all the rest, to have the greatest number and variety of\r\nbirds. But the fact that birds are most numerous in the eastern group, and\r\ndiminish as we go westward, is entirely opposed to this theory, while it is\r\nstrictly in accordance with the view that they are all stragglers from\r\nEurope, Africa, or the other Atlantic islands. Omitting oceanic wanderers,\r\nand including all birds which have probably arrived involuntarily, the\r\nnumbers are found to be forty species in the eastern group, thirty-six in\r\nthe central, and twenty-nine in the western.\r\n\r\nTo account for the presence of one peculiar species--the bullfinch (which,\r\nhowever, does not differ from the common European bullfinch more than do\r\nsome of the varieties of North American birds from their type-species) is\r\nnot difficult; the wonder rather being that there are not more peculiar\r\nforms. In our third chapter we have seen how great is the amount of\r\nindividual variation in birds, and how readily local varieties become\r\nestablished wherever the physical conditions are sufficiently distinct. Now\r\nwe can hardly have a greater difference of conditions {252} than between\r\nthe continent of Europe or North Africa, and a group of rocky islands in\r\nmid-Atlantic, situated in the full course of the Gulf Stream and with an\r\nexcessively mild though stormy climate. We have every reason to believe\r\nthat special modifications would soon become established in any animals\r\ncompletely isolated under such conditions. But they are not, as a rule,\r\nthus completely isolated, because, as we have seen, stragglers arrive at\r\nshort intervals; and these, mixing with the residents, keep up the purity\r\nof the breed. It follows, that only those species which reach the Azores at\r\nvery remote intervals will be likely to acquire well-marked distinctive\r\ncharacters; and this appears to have happened with the bullfinch alone, a\r\nbird which does not migrate, and is therefore less likely to be blown out\r\nto sea, more especially as it inhabits woody districts. A few other Azorean\r\nbirds, however, exhibit slight differences from their European allies.\r\n\r\nThere is another reason for the very slight amount of peculiarity presented\r\nby the fauna of the Azores as compared with many other oceanic islands,\r\ndependent on its comparatively recent origin. The islands themselves may be\r\nof considerable antiquity, since a few small deposits, believed to be of\r\nMiocene age, have been found on them, but there can be little doubt that\r\ntheir present fauna, at all events as concerns the birds, had its origin\r\nsince the date of the last glacial epoch. Even now icebergs reach the\r\nlatitude of the Azores but a little to the west of them; and when we\r\nconsider the proofs of extensive ice-action in North America and Europe, we\r\ncan hardly doubt that these islands were at that time surrounded with\r\npack-ice, while their own mountains, reaching 7,600 feet high in Pico,\r\nwould almost certainly have been covered with perpetual snow and have sent\r\ndown glaciers to the sea. They might then have had a climate almost as bad\r\nas that now endured by the Prince Edward Islands in the southern\r\nhemisphere, nearly ten degrees farther from the equator, where there are no\r\nland-birds whatever, although the distance from Africa is not much greater\r\nthan that of the Azores from Europe, while the vegetation is limited to a\r\nfew alpine plants and mosses. This recent origin of the {253} birds\r\naccounts in a great measure for their identity with those of Europe,\r\nbecause, whatever change has occurred must have been effected in the\r\nislands themselves, and in a time limited to that which has elapsed since\r\nthe glacial epoch passed away.\r\n\r\n_Insects of the Azores._--Having thus found no difficulty in accounting for\r\nthe peculiarities presented by the birds of these islands, we have only to\r\nsee how far the same general principles will apply to the insects and\r\nland-shells. The butterflies, moths, and hymenoptera, are few in number,\r\nand almost all seem to be common European species, whose presence is\r\nexplained by the same causes as those which have introduced the birds.\r\nBeetles, however, are more numerous, and have been better studied, and\r\nthese present some features of interest. The total number of species yet\r\nknown is 212, of which 175 are European; but out of these 101 are believed\r\nto have been introduced by human agency, leaving seventy-four really\r\nindigenous. Twenty-three of these indigenous species are not found in any\r\nof the other Atlantic islands, showing that they have been introduced\r\ndirectly from Europe by causes which have acted more powerfully here than\r\nfarther south. Besides these there are thirty-six species not found in\r\nEurope, of which nineteen are natives of Madeira or the Canaries, three are\r\nAmerican, and fourteen are altogether peculiar to the Azores. These latter\r\nare mostly allied to species found in Europe or in the other Atlantic\r\nislands, while one is allied to an American species, and two are so\r\ndistinct as to constitute new genera. The following list of these peculiar\r\nspecies will be interesting:--\r\n\r\n  CARABIDAE.\r\n\r\n  _Anchomenus aptinoides_     Allied to a species from the Canaries.\r\n  _Bembidium hesperus_        Allied to the European _B. laetum_.\r\n\r\n  DYTISCIDAE.\r\n\r\n  _Agabus godmanni_           Allied to the European _A. dispar_.\r\n\r\n  COLYDIIDAE.\r\n\r\n  _Tarphius wollastoni_       A genus almost peculiar to the Atlantic\r\n                              islands.\r\n  {254}\r\n\r\n  ELATERIDAE.\r\n\r\n  _Heteroderes azoricus_      Allied to a Brazilian species.\r\n  _Elastrus dolosus_          Belongs to a peculiar Madagascar genus!\r\n\r\n  MELYRIDAE.\r\n\r\n  _Attalus miniaticollis_     Allied to a Canarian species.\r\n\r\n  RHYNCOPHORA.\r\n\r\n  _Phlaeophagus variabilis_   Allied to European and Atlantic species.\r\n  _Acalles droueti_           A Mediterranean and Atlantic genus.\r\n  _Laparocerus azoricus_      Allied to Madeiran species.\r\n  _Asynonychun godmansi_      A peculiar genus, allied to _Brachyderes_, of\r\n                              the south of Europe.\r\n  _Neocnemis occidentalis_    A peculiar genus, allied to the European\r\n                              genus _Strophosomus_.\r\n\r\n  HETEROMERA.\r\n\r\n  _Helops azoricus_           Allied to _H. vulcanus_ of Madeira.\r\n\r\n  STAPHYLINIDAE.\r\n\r\n  _Xenomma melanocephala_     Allied to _X. filiforme_ from the Canaries.\r\n\r\nThis greater amount of speciality in the beetles than in the birds may be\r\ndue to two causes. In the first place many of these small insects have no\r\ndoubt survived the glacial epoch, and may, in that case, represent very\r\nancient forms which have become extinct in their native country; and in the\r\nsecond place, insects have many more chances of reaching remote islands\r\nthan birds, for not only may they be carried by gales of wind, but\r\nsometimes, in the egg or larva state or even as perfect insects, they may\r\nbe drifted safely for weeks over the ocean, buried in the light stems of\r\nplants or in the solid wood of trees in which many of them undergo their\r\ntransformations. Thus we may explain the presence of three common South\r\nAmerican species (two elaters and a longicorn), all wood-eaters, and\r\ntherefore liable to be occasionally brought in floating timber by the Gulf\r\nStream. But insects are also immensely more numerous in species than are\r\nland-birds, and their transmission would be in most cases quite\r\ninvoluntary, and not dependent on their own powers of flight as with birds;\r\nand thus the chances against the same species being frequently carried to\r\nthe same island would be considerable. If we add to this the dependence of\r\nso {255} many insects on local conditions of climate and vegetation, and\r\ntheir liability to be destroyed by insectivorous birds, we shall see that,\r\nalthough there may be a greater probability of insects as a whole reaching\r\nthe islands, the chance against any particular species arriving there, or\r\nagainst the same species arriving frequently, is much greater than in the\r\ncase of birds. The result is, that (as compared with Britain for example)\r\nthe birds are, proportionately, much more numerous than the beetles, while\r\nthe peculiar species of beetles are much more numerous than among birds,\r\nboth facts being quite in accordance with what we know of the habits of the\r\ntwo groups. We may also remark, that the small size and obscure characters\r\nof many of the beetles renders it probable that species now supposed to be\r\npeculiar, really inhabit some parts of Europe or North Africa.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that the two families which are pre-eminently\r\nwood, root, or seed eaters, are those which present the greatest amount of\r\nspeciality. The two Elateridae alone exhibit remote affinities, the one\r\nwith a Brazilian the other with a Madagascar group; while the only peculiar\r\ngenera belong to the Rhyncophora, but are allied to European forms. These\r\nlast almost certainly form a portion of the more ancient fauna of the\r\nislands which migrated to them in pre-glacial times, while the Brazilian\r\nelater appears to be the solitary example of a living insect brought by the\r\nGulf Stream to these remote shores. The elater, having its nearest living\r\nally in Madagascar (_Elastrus dolosus_), cannot be held to indicate any\r\nindependent communication between these distant islands; but is more\r\nprobably a relic of a once more widespread type which has only been able to\r\nmaintain itself in these localities. Mr. Crotch states that there are some\r\n_species_ of beetles common to Madagascar and the Canary Islands, while\r\nthere are several _genera_, common to Madagascar and South America, and\r\nsome to Madagascar and Australia. The clue to these apparent anomalies is\r\nfound in other genera being common to Madagascar, Africa, and South\r\nAmerica, while others are Asiatic or Australian. Madagascar, in fact, has\r\ninsect relations with every part of {256} the globe, and the only rational\r\nexplanation of such facts is, that they are indications of very ancient and\r\nonce widespread groups, maintaining themselves only in a few widely\r\nseparated portions of what was at one time or another the area of their\r\ndistribution.\r\n\r\n_Land-shells of the Azores._--Like the insects and birds, the land-shells\r\nof these islands have a generally European aspect, but with a larger\r\nproportion of peculiar species. This was to be expected, because the means\r\nby which molluscs are carried over the sea are far less numerous and varied\r\nthan in the case of insects;[51] and we may therefore conclude that their\r\nintroduction is a very rare event, and that a species once arrived remains\r\nfor long periods undisturbed by new arrivals, and is therefore more likely\r\nto become modified by the new conditions, and then fixed as a distinct\r\ntype. Out of the sixty-nine known species, thirty-seven are common to\r\nEurope or the other Atlantic islands, while thirty-two are peculiar, though\r\nalmost all are distinctly allied to European types. The majority of these\r\nshells, especially the peculiar forms, are very small, and many of them may\r\ndate back to beyond the glacial epoch. The eggs of these would be\r\nexceedingly minute, and might occasionally be carried on leaves or other\r\nmaterials during gales of exceptional violence and duration, while others\r\nmight be conveyed with the earth that often sticks to the feet of birds.\r\nThere are also, probably, other unknown means of conveyance; but however\r\nthis may be, the general character of the land-molluscs is such as to\r\nconfirm the conclusions we have arrived at from a study of the birds and\r\ninsects,--that these islands have never been connected with a continent,\r\nand have been peopled with living things by such forms only as in some way\r\nor other have been able to reach them across many hundred miles of ocean.\r\n\r\n_The Flora of the Azores._--The flowering-plants of the Azores have been\r\nstudied by one of our first botanists, Mr. H. C. Watson, who has himself\r\nvisited the islands and made extensive collections; and he has given a\r\ncomplete catalogue of the species in Mr. Godman's volume. As our {257}\r\nobject in the present work is to trace the past history of the more\r\nimportant islands by means of the forms of life that inhabit them, and as\r\nfor this purpose plants are sometimes of more value than any class of\r\nanimals, it will be well to take advantage of the valuable materials here\r\navailable, in order to ascertain how far the evidence derived from the two\r\norganic kingdoms agrees in character; and also to obtain some general\r\nresults which may be of service in our discussion of more difficult and\r\nmore complex problems.\r\n\r\nThere are in the Azores 480 known species of flowering-plants and ferns, of\r\nwhich no less than 440 are found also in Europe, Madeira, or the Canary\r\nIslands; while forty are peculiar to the Azores, but are more or less\r\nclosely allied to European species. As botanists are no less prone than\r\nzoologists to invoke former land-connections and continental extensions to\r\naccount for the wide dispersal of objects of their study, it will be well\r\nto examine somewhat closely what these facts really imply.\r\n\r\n_The Dispersal of Seeds._--The seeds of plants are liable to be dispersed\r\nby a greater variety of agents than any other organisms, while their\r\ntenacity of life, under varying conditions of heat and cold, drought and\r\nmoisture, is also exceptionally great. They have also an advantage, in that\r\nthe great majority of flowering plants have the sexes united in the same\r\nindividual, so that a single seed in a state fit to germinate may easily\r\nstock a whole island. The dispersal of seeds has been studied by Sir Joseph\r\nHooker, Mr. Darwin, and many other writers, who have made it sufficiently\r\nclear that they are in many cases liable to be carried enormous distances.\r\nAn immense number are specially adapted to be carried by the wind, through\r\nthe possession of down or hairs, or membranous wings or processes; while\r\nothers are so minute, and produced in such profusion, that it is difficult\r\nto place a limit to the distance they might be carried by gales of wind or\r\nhurricanes. Another class of somewhat heavier seeds or dry fruits are\r\ncapable of being exposed for a long time to sea-water without injury. Mr.\r\nDarwin made many experiments on this point, and he found that many seeds,\r\nespecially of Atriplex, {258} Beta, oats, Capsicum, and the potato, grew\r\nafter 100 days' immersion, while a large number survived fifty days. But he\r\nalso found that most of them sink after a few days' immersion, and this\r\nwould certainly prevent them being floated to very great distances. It is\r\nvery possible, however, that dried branches or flower-heads containing\r\nseeds would float longer, while it is quite certain that many tropical\r\nseeds do float for enormous distances, as witness the double cocoa-nuts\r\nwhich cross the Indian ocean from the Seychelle Islands to the coast of\r\nSumatra, and the West Indian beans which frequently reach the west coast of\r\nScotland. There is therefore ample evidence of the possibility of seeds\r\nbeing conveyed across the sea for great distances by winds and surface\r\ncurrents.[52]\r\n\r\n_Birds as Seed-carriers._--The great variety of fruits that are eaten by\r\nbirds afford a means of plant-dispersal in the fact that seeds often pass\r\nthrough the bodies of birds in a state well-fitted for germination; and\r\nsuch seeds may occasionally be carried long distances by this means. Of the\r\ntwenty-two land-birds found in the Azores, half are, more or less,\r\nfruit-eaters, and these may have been the means of introducing many plants\r\ninto the islands.\r\n\r\nBirds also frequently have small portions of earth on their feet; and Mr.\r\nDarwin has shown by actual experiment that almost all such earth contains\r\nseeds. Thus in {259} nine grains of earth on the leg of a woodcock a seed\r\nof the toad-rush was found which germinated; while a wounded red-legged\r\npartridge had a ball of earth weighing six and a half ounces adhering to\r\nits leg, and from this earth Mr. Darwin raised no less than eighty-two\r\nseparate plants of about five distinct species. Still more remarkable was\r\nthe experiment with six and three-quarter ounces of mud from the edge of a\r\nlittle pond, which, carefully treated under glass, produced 537 distinct\r\nplants! This is equal to a seed for every six grains of mud, and when we\r\nconsider how many birds frequent the edges of ponds in search of food, or\r\ncome there to drink, it is evident that great numbers of seeds may be\r\ndispersed by this means.\r\n\r\nMany seeds have hispid awns, hooks, or prickles which readily attach them\r\nto the feathers of birds, and a great number of aquatic birds nest inland\r\non the ground; and as these are pre-eminently wanderers, they must often\r\naid in the dispersal of such plants.[53]\r\n\r\n{260}\r\n\r\n_Facilities for Dispersal of Azorean Plants._--Now in the course of very\r\nlong periods of time the various causes here enumerated would be sufficient\r\nto stock the remotest islands with vegetation, and a considerable part of\r\nthe Azorean flora appears well adapted to be so conveyed. Of the 439\r\nflowering-plants in Mr. Watson's list, I find that about forty-five belong\r\nto genera that have either pappus or winged seeds; sixty-five to such as\r\nhave very minute seeds; thirty have fleshy fruits such as are greedily\r\neaten by birds; several have hispid seeds; and eighty-four are glumaceous\r\nplants, which are all probably well-adapted for being carried partly by\r\nwinds and partly by currents, as well as by some of the other causes\r\nmentioned. On the other hand we have a very suggestive fact in the absence\r\nfrom the Azores of most of the trees and shrubs with large and heavy\r\nfruits, however common they may be in Europe. Such are oaks, chestnuts,\r\nhazels, apples, beeches, alders, and firs; while the only trees or large\r\nshrubs are the Portugal laurel, myrtle, laurestinus, elder, _Laurus\r\ncanariensis_, _Myrica faya_, and a doubtfully peculiar juniper--all small\r\nberry-bearers, and therefore likely to have been conveyed by one or other\r\nof the modes suggested above.\r\n\r\nThere can be little doubt that the truly indigenous flora of the islands is\r\nfar more scanty than the number of plants recorded would imply, because a\r\nlarge but unknown proportion of the species are certainly importations,\r\nvoluntary or involuntary, by man. As, however, the general character of the\r\nwhole flora is that of the south-western peninsula of Europe, and as most\r\nof the introduced plants have come from the same country, it is almost\r\nimpossible now to separate them, and Mr. Watson has not attempted to do so.\r\nThe whole flora contains representatives of eighty natural orders and 250\r\ngenera: and even if we suppose that one-half the species only are truly\r\nindigenous, {261} there will still remain a wonderfully rich and varied\r\nflora to have been carried, by the various natural means above indicated,\r\nover 900 miles of ocean, more especially as the large proportion of species\r\nidentical with those of Europe shows that their introduction has been\r\ncomparatively recent, and that it is, probably (as in the case of the\r\nbirds) still going on. We may therefore feel sure that we have here by no\r\nmeans reached the limit of distance to which plants can be conveyed by\r\nnatural means across the ocean; and this conclusion will be of great value\r\nto us in investigating other cases where the evidence at our command is\r\nless complete, and the indications of origin more obscure or conflicting.\r\n\r\nOf the forty species which are considered to be peculiar to the islands,\r\nall are allied to European plants except six, whose nearest affinities are\r\nin the Canaries or Madeira. Two of the Compositae are considered to be\r\ndistinct genera, but in this order generic divisions rest on slight\r\ntechnical distinctions; and the _Campanula vidalii_ is very distinct from\r\nany other known species. With these exceptions, most of the peculiar\r\nAzorean species are closely allied to European plants, and are in several\r\ncases little more than varieties of them. While therefore we may believe\r\nthat the larger part of the existing flora reached the islands since the\r\nglacial epoch, a portion of it may be more ancient, as there is no doubt\r\nthat a majority of the species could withstand some lowering of\r\ntemperature; while in such a warm latitude and surrounded with sea, there\r\nwould always be many sunny and sheltered spots in which even tender plants\r\nmight flourish.\r\n\r\n_Important Deduction from the Peculiarities of the Azorean Fauna and\r\nFlora._--There is one conclusion to be drawn from the almost wholly\r\nEuropean character of the Azorean fauna and flora which deserves special\r\nattention, namely, that the peopling of remote islands is not due so much\r\nto ordinary or normal, as to extraordinary and exceptional causes. These\r\nislands lie in the course of the south-westerly return trades and also of\r\nthe Gulf Stream, and we should therefore naturally expect that American\r\nbirds, insects, and plants would preponderate if they were {262} conveyed\r\nby the regular winds and currents, which are both such as to prevent\r\nEuropean species from reaching the islands. But the violent storms to which\r\nthe Azores are liable blow from all points of the compass; and it is\r\nevidently to these, combined with the greater proximity and more favourable\r\nsituation of the coasts of Europe and North Africa, that the presence of a\r\nfauna and flora so decidedly European is to be traced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe other North Atlantic Islands--Madeira, the Canaries, and the Cape de\r\nVerdes--present analogous phenomena to those of the Azores, but with some\r\npeculiarities dependent on their more southern position, their richer\r\nvegetation, and perhaps their greater antiquity. These have been\r\nsufficiently discussed in my _Geographical Distribution of Animals_ (Vol.\r\nI. pp. 208-215); and as we are now dealing with what may be termed typical\r\nexamples of oceanic islands, for the purpose of illustrating the laws, and\r\nsolving the problems presented by the dispersal of animals, we will pass on\r\nto other cases which have been less fully discussed in that work.\r\n\r\nBERMUDA.\r\n\r\nThe Bermudas are a small group of low islands formed of coral, and blown\r\ncoral-sand consolidated into rock. They are situated in 32deg N. Lat.,\r\nabout 700 miles from North Carolina, and somewhat farther from the Bahama\r\nIslands, and are thus rather more favourably placed for receiving\r\nimmigrants from America and its islands than the Azores are with respect to\r\nEurope. There are about 100 islands and islets in all, but their total area\r\ndoes not exceed fifty square miles. They are surrounded by reefs, some at a\r\ndistance of thirty miles from the main group; and the discovery of a layer\r\nof earth with remains of cedar-trees forty-eight feet below the present\r\nhigh-water mark shows that the islands have once been more extensive and\r\nprobably included the whole area now occupied by shoals and reefs.[54]\r\nImmediately beyond these reefs, {263} however, extends a very deep ocean,\r\nwhile about 450 miles distant in a south-east direction, the deepest part\r\nof the North Atlantic is reached, where soundings of 3,825 and 3,875\r\nfathoms have been obtained. It is clear therefore that these islands are\r\ntypically oceanic.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP OF BERMUDA AND THE AMERICAN COAST.]\r\n\r\n  NOTE.--The light tint indicates sea less than 1,000 fathoms deep.\r\n         The dark tint      ,,     ,, more than 1,000 fathoms deep.\r\n         The figures show the depth in fathoms.\r\n\r\nSoundings were taken by the _Challenger_ in four {264} different directions\r\naround Bermuda, and always showed a rapid deepening of the sea to about\r\n2,500 fathoms. This was so remarkable, that in his reports to the\r\nAdmiralty, Captain Nares spoke of Bermuda as \"a solitary peak rising\r\nabruptly from a base only 120 miles in diameter;\" and in another place as\r\n\"an isolated peak rising abruptly from a very small base.\" These\r\nexpressions show that Bermuda is looked upon as a typical example of an\r\n\"oceanic peak\"; and on examining the series of official reports of the\r\n_Challenger_ soundings, I can find no similar case, although some coasts,\r\nboth of continents and islands, descend more abruptly. In order to show,\r\ntherefore, what is the real character of this peak, I have drawn a section\r\nof it on a true scale from the soundings taken in a north and south\r\ndirection where the descent is steepest. It will be seen that the slope is\r\non both sides very easy, being 1 in 16 on the south, and 1 in 19 on the\r\nnorth. The portion nearest the islands will slope more rapidly, perhaps\r\nreaching in places 1 in 10; but even this is not steeper than many country\r\nroads in hilly countries, while the remainder would be a hardly perceptible\r\nslope. Although generally very low, some parts of these islands rise to 250\r\nfeet above the sea-level, consisting of various kinds of limestone rock,\r\nsometimes soft and friable, but often very hard and even crystalline. It\r\nconsists of beds which sometimes dip as much as 30deg, and which also show\r\ngreat contortions, so that at first sight the islands appear to exhibit on\r\na small scale the phenomena of a disturbed Palaeozoic district. It has\r\nhowever long been known that these rocks are all due to the wind, {265}\r\nwhich blows up the fine calcareous sand, the product of the disintegration\r\nof coral, shells, serpulae, and other organisms, forming sand-hills forty\r\nand fifty feet high, which move gradually along, overwhelming the lower\r\ntracts of land behind them. These are consolidated by the percolation of\r\nrain-water, which dissolves some of the lime from the more porous tracts\r\nand deposits it lower down, filling every fissure with stalagmite.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SECTION OF BERMUDA AND ADJACENT SEA BOTTOM.\r\n\r\nThe figures show the depth in fathoms at fifty-five miles north and\r\nforty-six miles south of the islands respectively.]\r\n\r\n_The Red Clay of Bermuda._--Besides the calcareous rocks there is found in\r\nmany parts of the islands a layer of red earth or clay, containing about\r\nthirty per cent. of oxide of iron. This very closely resembles, both in\r\ncolour and chemical composition, the red clay of the ocean floor, found\r\nwidely spread in the Atlantic at depths of from 2,300 to 3,150 fathoms, and\r\noccurring abundantly all round Bermuda. It appears, therefore, at first\r\nsight, as if the ocean bed itself has been here raised to the surface, and\r\na portion of its covering of red clay preserved; and this is the view\r\nadopted by Mr. Jones in his paper on the \"Botany of Bermuda.\" He says,\r\nafter giving the analysis: \"This analysis tends to convince us that the\r\ndeep chocolate-coloured red clay of the islands found in the lower levels,\r\nand from high-water mark some distance into the sea, originally came from\r\nthe ocean floor, and that when by volcanic agency the Bermuda column was\r\nraised from the depths of the sea, its summit, most probably broken in\r\noutline, appeared above the surface covered with this red mud, which in the\r\ncourse of ages has but slightly changed its composition, and yet possesses\r\nsufficient evidence to prove its identity with that now lying contiguous to\r\nthe base of the Bermuda column.\" But in his _Guide to Bermuda_ Mr. Jones\r\ntells us that this same red earth has been found, two feet thick, under\r\ncoral rock at a depth of forty-two feet below low-water mark, and that it\r\n\"rested on a bed of compact calcareous sandstone.\" Now it is quite certain\r\nthat this \"calcareous sandstone\" was never formed at the bottom of the deep\r\nocean 700 miles from land; and the occurrence of the red earth at different\r\nlevels upon coralline sand rock is therefore more probably due to some\r\nprocess of decomposition of the rock itself, {266} or of the minute\r\norganisms which abound in the blown sand.[55]\r\n\r\n_Zoology of Bermuda._--As might be expected from their extreme isolation,\r\nthese islands possess no indigenous terrestrial mammalia, frogs, or\r\nsnakes.[56] There is however one lizard, which Professor Cope considers to\r\nbe distinct from any American species, and which he has named _Plestiodon\r\n(Eumeces) longirostris_. It is said to be most nearly allied to _Eumeces\r\nquinquelineatus_ of the south-eastern States, from which it differs in\r\nhaving nearly ten more rows of scales, the tail thicker, and the muzzle\r\nlonger. In colour it is ashy brown above, greenish blue beneath, with a\r\nwhite line black-margined on the sides, and it seems to be tolerably\r\nabundant in the islands. This lizard is especially interesting as being the\r\nonly vertebrate animal which exhibits any peculiarity.\r\n\r\n_Birds._--Notwithstanding its small size, low altitude and {267} remote\r\nposition, a great number of birds visit Bermuda annually, some in large\r\nnumbers, others only as accidental stragglers. Altogether, over 180 species\r\nhave been recorded, rather more than half being wading and swimming birds,\r\nwhose presence is not so much to be wondered at as they are great\r\nwanderers; while about eighty-five are land birds, many of which would\r\nhardly be supposed capable of flying so great a distance. Of the 180\r\nspecies, however, about thirty have only been seen once, and a great many\r\nmore are very rare; but about twenty species of land birds are recorded as\r\ntolerably frequent visitors, and nearly half these appear to come every\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nThere are only eleven species which are permanent residents on the\r\nisland--eight land, and three water birds, and of these one has been almost\r\ncertainly introduced. These resident birds are as follows:--\r\n\r\n    1. _Galeoscoptes carolinensis._ (The Cat bird.) Migrates along the east\r\n    coast of the United States.\r\n\r\n    2. _Sialia sialis._ (The Blue bird.) Migrates along the east coast.\r\n\r\n    3. _Vireo novaeboracensis._ (The White-eyed green Tit.) Migrates along\r\n    the east coast.\r\n\r\n    4. _Passer domesticus._ (The English Sparrow.) ? Introduced.\r\n\r\n    5. _Corvus americanus._ (The American Crow.) Common over all North\r\n    America.\r\n\r\n    6. _Cardinalis virginianus._ (The Cardinal bird.)

This is\r\ndue, first, to the small area and little varied surface of these islands,\r\nas well as to their limited flora and small supply of insects not affording\r\nconditions suitable for the residence of many species all the year round;\r\nand, secondly, to the peculiarity of the climate of North America, which\r\ncauses a much larger number of its birds to be migratory than in Europe.\r\nThe Northern United States and Canada, with a sunny climate, luxuriant\r\nvegetation, and abundant insect-life during the summer, supply food and\r\nshelter to an immense number of insectivorous and frugivorous birds; so\r\nthat during the breeding season Canada is actually richer in bird-life than\r\nFlorida. But as the severe winter comes on all these are obliged to migrate\r\nsouthward, some to Carolina, Georgia, and Florida, others as far as the\r\nWest Indies, Mexico, or even to Guatemala and South America.\r\n\r\nEvery spring and autumn, therefore a vast multitude of birds, belonging to\r\nmore than a hundred distinct species, migrate northward or southward in\r\nEastern America. A large proportion of these pass along the Atlantic coast,\r\nand it has been observed that many of them fly some distance out to sea,\r\npassing straight across bays from headland to headland by the shortest\r\nroute.\r\n\r\nNow as the time of these migrations is the season of storms, especially the\r\nautumnal one, which nearly coincides with the hurricanes of the West Indies\r\nand the northerly gales of the coast of America, the migrating birds are\r\nvery liable to be carried out to sea. Sometimes they may, as Mr. Jones\r\nsuggests, be carried up by local whirlwinds to a great height, where\r\nmeeting with a westerly or north-westerly gale, they are rapidly driven\r\nsea-ward. The great majority no doubt perish, but some reach the Bermudas\r\n{269} and form one of its most striking autumnal features. In October, Mr.\r\nJones tells us, the sportsman enjoys more shooting than at any other time.\r\nThe violent revolving gales, which occur almost weekly, bring numbers of\r\nbirds of many species from the American continent, the different members of\r\nthe duck tribe forming no inconsiderable portion of the whole; while the\r\nCanada goose, and even the ponderous American swan, have been seen amidst\r\nthe migratory host. With these come also such delicate birds as the\r\nAmerican robin (_Turdus migratorius_), the yellow-rumped warbler\r\n(_Dendroeca coronata_), the pine warbler (_Dendroeca pinus_), the wood\r\nwagtail (_Siurus novaeboracensis_), the summer red bird (_Pyranga\r\naestiva_), the snow-bunting (_Plectrophanes nivalis_), the red-poll\r\n(_Aegiothus linarius_), the king bird (_Tyrannus carolinensis_), and many\r\nothers. It is no doubt in consequence of this repeated immigration that\r\nnone of the Bermuda birds have acquired any special peculiarity\r\nconstituting even a distinct variety; for the few species that are resident\r\nand breed in the islands are continually crossed by individual immigrants\r\nof the same species from the mainland.\r\n\r\nFour European birds also have occurred in Bermuda;--the wheatear (_Saxicola\r\noenanthe_), which visits Iceland and Lapland and sometimes the northern\r\nUnited States; the skylark (_Alauda arvensis_), but this was probably an\r\nimported bird or an escape from some ship; the land-rail (_Crex\r\npratensis_), which also wanders to Greenland and the United States; and the\r\ncommon snipe (_Scolopax gallinago_), which occurs not unfrequently in\r\nGreenland but has not yet been noticed in North America. It is however so\r\nlike the American snipe (_S. wilsoni_), that a straggler might easily be\r\noverlooked.\r\n\r\nTwo small bats of N. American species also occasionally reach the island,\r\nwhile two others from the West Indies have more rarely occurred, and these\r\nare the only wild mammalia except rats and mice.\r\n\r\n_Insects of Bermuda._--Insects appear to be very scarce; but it is evident\r\nfrom the lists given by Mr. Jones, and more recently by Professor Heilprin,\r\nthat only the more conspicuous species have been yet collected. These {270}\r\ncomprise nineteen beetles, eleven bees and wasps, twenty-six butterflies\r\nand moths, nine flies, and the same number of Hemiptera, Orthoptera, and\r\nNeuroptera respectively. All appear to be common North American or West\r\nIndian species; but until some competent entomological collector visits the\r\nislands it is impossible to say whether there are or are not any peculiar\r\nspecies.[57]\r\n\r\n_Land Mollusca._--The land-shells of the Bermudas are somewhat more\r\ninteresting, as they appear to be the only group of animals except reptiles\r\nin which there are any peculiar species. The following list was kindly\r\nfurnished me by Mr. Thomas Bland of New York, who has made a special study\r\nof the terrestrial molluscs of the West Indian Islands, from which those of\r\nthe Bermudas have undoubtedly been derived. The nomenclature has been\r\ncorrected in accordance with the list given in Professor Heilprin's work on\r\nthe islands. The species which are peculiar to the islands are indicated by\r\nitalics.\r\n\r\nLIST OF THE LAND-SHELLS OF BERMUDA.\r\n\r\n  1. Succinea fulgens. (Lea.)

Barbuda.[58]\r\n\r\nMr. Bland indicates only four species as certainly peculiar to Bermuda, and\r\nanother sub-fossil species; while one or two of the remainder are indicated\r\nas doubtfully identical with those of other countries. We have thus about\r\none-fifth of the land-shells peculiar, while almost all the other\r\nproductions of the islands are identical with those of the adjacent\r\ncontinent and islands. This corresponds, however, with what occurs\r\ngenerally in islands at some distance from continents. In the Azores only\r\none land-bird is peculiar out of eighteen resident species; the beetles\r\nshow about one-eighth of the probably non-introduced species as peculiar;\r\nthe plants about one-twentieth; while the land-shells have about half the\r\nspecies peculiar. This difference is well explained by the much greater\r\ndifficulty of transmission over wide seas, in the case of land-shells, than\r\nof any other terrestrial organisms. It thus happens that when a species has\r\nonce been conveyed it may remain isolated for unknown ages, and has time to\r\nbecome modified by local conditions unchecked by the introduction of other\r\nindividuals of the original type.\r\n\r\n_Flora of Bermuda._--Unfortunately no good account of the plants of these\r\nislands has yet been published. Mr. {272} Jones, in his paper \"On the\r\nVegetation of the Bermudas\" gives a list of no less than 480 species of\r\nflowering plants; but this number includes all the culinary plants,\r\nfruit-trees, and garden flowers, as well as all the ornamental trees and\r\nshrubs from various parts of the world which have been introduced, mixed up\r\nwith the European and American weeds that have come with agricultural or\r\ngarden seeds, and the really indigenous plants, in one undistinguished\r\nseries. It appears too, that the late Governor, Major-General Lefroy, \"has\r\nsown and distributed throughout the islands packets of seeds from Kew,\r\nrepresenting no less than 600 species, principally of trees and shrubs\r\nsuited to sandy coast soils\"--so that it will be more than ever difficult\r\nin future years to distinguish the indigenous from the introduced\r\nvegetation.\r\n\r\nFrom the researches of Dr. Rein and Mr. Moseley there appear to be about\r\n250 flowering plants in a wild state, and of these Mr. Moseley thinks less\r\nthan half are indigenous. The majority are tropical and West Indian, while\r\nothers are common to the Southern States of North America; the former class\r\nhaving been largely brought by means of the Gulf Stream, the latter by the\r\nagency of birds or by winds. Mr. Jones tells us that the currents bring\r\nnumberless objects animate and inanimate from the Carribean Sea, including\r\nthe seeds of trees, shrubs, and other plants, which are continually cast\r\nashore and sometimes vegetate. The soap-berry tree (_Sapindus saponaria_)\r\nhas been actually observed to originate in this way.\r\n\r\nThe only _species_ of flowering plant peculiar to Bermuda is _Carex\r\nBermudiana_ (Hemsley), which is said to be allied to a species found only\r\nin St. Helena; but there are some local forms of continental species, among\r\nwhich are _Sisyrinchium Bermudianum_ and a variety of _Rhus toxicodendron_.\r\nThere are, however, two ferns--an Adiantum and a Nephrodium, which are\r\nunknown from any other locality. The juniper, which is so conspicuous a\r\nfeature of the islands, is said to be a West Indian species (_Juniperus\r\nbarbadensis_) found in Jamaica and the Bahamas, not the North American red\r\n{273} cedar; but there seems to be still some doubt about this common\r\nplant.\r\n\r\nMr. Moseley, who visited Bermuda in the _Challenger_, has well explained\r\nthe probable origin of the vegetation. The large number of West Indian\r\nplants is no doubt due to the Gulf Stream and constant surface drift of\r\nwarm water in this direction, while others have been brought by the annual\r\ncyclones which sweep over the intervening ocean. The great number of\r\nAmerican migratory birds, including large flocks of the American golden\r\nplover, with ducks and other aquatic species, no doubt occasionally bring\r\nseeds, either in the mud attached to their feet or in their stomachs.[59]\r\nAs these causes are either constantly in action or recur annually, it is\r\nnot surprising that almost all the species should be unchanged owing to the\r\nfrequent intercrossing of freshly-arrived specimens. If a competent\r\nbotanist were thoroughly to explore Bermuda, eliminate the species\r\nintroduced by human agency, and investigate the source from whence the\r\nothers were derived and the mode by which they had reached so remote an\r\nisland, we should obtain important information as to the dispersal of\r\nplants, which might afford us a clue to the solution of many difficult\r\nproblems in their geographical distribution.\r\n\r\n_Concluding Remarks._--The two groups of islands we have now been\r\nconsidering furnish us with some most instructive facts as to the power of\r\nmany groups of organisms to pass over from 700 to 900 miles of open sea.\r\nThere is no doubt whatever that all the indigenous species have thus\r\nreached these islands, and in many cases the process may be seen going on\r\nfrom year to year. We find that, as regards birds, migratory habits and the\r\nliability to be caught by violent storms are the conditions which determine\r\nthe island-population. In both islands the land-birds are almost\r\nexclusively migrants; and in both, the non-migratory groups--wrens, tits,\r\ncreepers, and nuthatches--are absent; while the number of annual visitors\r\nis greater in proportion as the migratory habits and prevalence of storms\r\nafford more efficient means for their introduction. {274}\r\n\r\nWe find also, that these great distances do not prevent the immigration of\r\nsome insects of most of the orders, and especially of a considerable number\r\nand variety of beetles; while even land-shells are fairly represented in\r\nboth islands, the large proportion of peculiar species clearly indicating\r\nthat, as we might expect, individuals of this group of organisms arrive\r\nonly at long and irregular intervals.\r\n\r\nPlants are represented by a considerable variety of orders and genera, most\r\nof which show some special adaptation for dispersal by wind or water, or\r\nthrough the medium of birds; and there is no reason to doubt that besides\r\nthe species that have actually established themselves, many others must\r\nhave reached the islands, but were either not suited to the climate and\r\nother physical conditions, or did not find the insects necessary to their\r\nfertilisation, and were therefore unable to maintain themselves.\r\n\r\nIf now we consider the extreme remoteness and isolation of these islands,\r\ntheir small area and comparatively recent origin, and that, notwithstanding\r\nall these disadvantages, they have acquired a very considerable and varied\r\nflora and fauna, we shall, I think, be convinced, that with a larger area\r\nand greater antiquity, mere separation from a continent by many hundred\r\nmiles of sea would not prevent a country from acquiring a very luxuriant\r\nand varied flora, and a fauna also rich and peculiar as regards all classes\r\nexcept terrestrial mammals, amphibia, and some groups of reptiles. This\r\nconclusion will be of great importance in those cases where the evidence as\r\nto the exact origin of the fauna and flora of an island is less clear and\r\nsatisfactory than in the case of the Azores and Bermuda.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{275}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nTHE GALAPAGOS ISLANDS\r\n\r\n    Position and Physical Features--Absence of Indigenous Mammalia and\r\n    Amphibia--Reptiles--Birds--Insects and Land-Shells--The Keeling Islands\r\n    as Illustrating the Manner in which Oceanic Islands are Peopled--Flora\r\n    of the Galapagos--Origin of the Flora of the Galapagos--Concluding\r\n    Remarks.\r\n\r\nThe Galapagos differ in many important respects from the islands we have\r\nexamined in our last chapter, and the differences are such as to have\r\naffected the whole character of their animal inhabitants. Like the Azores,\r\nthey are volcanic, but they are much more extensive, the islands being both\r\nlarger and more numerous; while volcanic action has been so recent that a\r\nlarge portion of their surface consists of barren lava-fields. They are\r\nconsiderably less distant from a continent than either the Azores or\r\nBermuda, being about 600 miles from the west coast of South America and a\r\nlittle more than 700 from Veragua, with the small Cocos Islands\r\nintervening; and they are situated on the equator instead of being in the\r\nnorth temperate zone. They stand upon a deeply submerged bank, the 1,000\r\nfathom line encircling all the more important islands at a few miles\r\ndistance, whence there appears to be a comparatively steep descent all\r\nround to the average depth of that portion of the Pacific, between 2,000\r\nand 3,000 fathoms. {276}\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP OF THE GALAPAGOS AND ADJACENT COASTS OF SOUTH AMERICA.]\r\n\r\n  The light tint shows where the sea is less than 1,000 fathoms deep.\r\n  The figures show the depth in fathoms.\r\n\r\nThe whole group occupies a space of about 300 by 200 miles. It consists of\r\nfive large and twelve small islands; the largest (Albemarle Island) being\r\nabout eighty miles long and of very irregular shape, while the four next in\r\nimportance--Chatham, Indefatigable, James, and Narborough Islands, are each\r\nabout twenty-five or thirty miles {277} long, and of a rounded or elongate\r\nform. The whole are entirely volcanic, and in the western islands there are\r\nnumerous active volcanoes. Unlike the other groups of islands we have been\r\nconsidering, these are situated in a comparatively calm sea, where storms\r\nare of rare occurrence and even strong winds almost unknown. They are\r\ntraversed by ocean currents which are strong and constant, flowing towards\r\nthe north-west from the coast of Peru; {278} and these physical conditions\r\nhave had a powerful influence on the animal and vegetable forms by which\r\nthe islands are now inhabited. The Galapagos have also, during three\r\ncenturies, been frequently visited by Europeans, and were long a favourite\r\nresort of buccaneers and traders, who found an ample supply of food in the\r\nlarge tortoises which abound there; and to these visits we may perhaps\r\ntrace the introduction of some animals whose presence it is otherwise\r\ndifficult to account for. The vegetation is generally scanty, but still\r\namply sufficient for the support of a considerable amount of animal life,\r\nas shown by the cattle, horses, asses, goats, pigs, dogs, and cats, which\r\nnow run wild in some of the islands.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP OF THE GALAPAGOS.]\r\n\r\n  The light tint shows a depth of less than 1,000 fathoms.\r\n  The figures show the depth in fathoms.\r\n\r\n_Absence of Indigenous Mammalia and Amphibia._--As in all other oceanic\r\nislands, we find here no truly indigenous mammalia, for though there is a\r\nmouse of the American genus Hesperomys, which differs somewhat from any\r\nknown species, we can hardly consider this to be indigenous; first, because\r\nthese creatures have been little studied in South America, and there may\r\nyet be many undescribed species, and in the second place because even had\r\nit been introduced by some European or native vessel, there is ample time\r\nin two or three hundred years for the very different conditions to have\r\nestablished a marked diversity in the characters of the species. This is\r\nthe more probable because there is also a true rat of the Old World genus\r\nMus, which is said to differ slightly from any known species; and as this\r\ngenus is not a native of the American continents we are sure that it must\r\nhave been recently introduced into the Galapagos. There can be little doubt\r\ntherefore that the islands are completely destitute of truly indigenous\r\nmammalia; and frogs and toads, the only tropical representatives of the\r\nAmphibia, are equally unknown.\r\n\r\n_Reptiles._--Reptiles, however, which at first sight appear as unsuited as\r\nmammals to pass over a wide expanse of ocean, abound in the Galapagos,\r\nthough the species are not very numerous. They consist of land-tortoises,\r\nlizards and snakes. The tortoises consist of two peculiar species, _Testudo\r\nmicrophyes_, found in most of the islands, and _T. {279} abingdonii_\r\nrecently discovered on Abingdon Island, as well as one extinct species, _T.\r\nephippium_, found on Indefatigable Island. These are all of very large\r\nsize, like the gigantic tortoises of the Mascarene Islands, from which,\r\nhowever, they differ in structural characters; and Dr. Guenther believes\r\nthat they have been originally derived from the American continent.[60]\r\nConsidering the well known tenacity of life of these animals, and the large\r\nnumber of allied forms which have aquatic or sub-aquatic habits, it is not\r\na very extravagant supposition that some ancestral form, carried out to sea\r\nby a flood, was once or twice safely drifted as far as the Galapagos, and\r\nthus originated the races which now inhabit them.\r\n\r\nThe lizards are five in number; a peculiar species of gecko,\r\n_Phyllodactylus galapagensis_, and four species of the American family\r\nIguanidae. Two of these are distinct species of the genus Tropidurus, the\r\nother two being large, and so very distinct as to be classed in peculiar\r\ngenera. One of these is aquatic and found in all the islands, swimming in\r\nthe sea at some distance from the shore and feeding on seaweed; the other\r\nis terrestrial, and is confined to the four central islands. These last\r\nwere originally described as _Amblyrhynchus cristatus_ by Mr. Bell, and _A.\r\nsubcristatus_ by Gray; they were afterwards placed in two other genera\r\nTrachycephalus and Oreocephalus (_see_ Brit. Mus. Catalogue of Lizards),\r\nwhile in a recent paper by Dr. Steindachner, the marine species is again\r\nclassed as Amblyrhynchus, while the terrestrial form is placed in another\r\ngenus Conolophus, both genera being peculiar to the Galapagos.\r\n\r\nHow these lizards reached the islands we cannot tell. The fact that they\r\nall belong to American genera or families indicates their derivation from\r\nthat continent, while their being all distinct species is a proof that\r\ntheir arrival took place at a remote epoch, under conditions perhaps\r\nsomewhat different from any which now prevail. It is certain that animals\r\nof this order have some means of crossing the sea not possessed by any\r\nother land vertebrates, {280} since they are found in a considerable number\r\nof islands which possess no mammals nor any other land reptiles; but what\r\nthose means are has not yet been positively ascertained.\r\n\r\nIt is unusual for oceanic islands to possess snakes, and it is therefore\r\nsomewhat of an anomaly that two species are found in the Galapagos. Both\r\nare closely allied to South American forms, and one is hardly different\r\nfrom a Chilian snake, so that they indicate a more recent origin than in\r\nthe case of the lizards. Snakes it is known can survive a long time at sea,\r\nsince a living boa-constrictor once reached the island of St. Vincent from\r\nthe coast of South America, a distance of two hundred miles by the shortest\r\nroute. Snakes often frequent trees, and might thus be conveyed long\r\ndistances if carried out to sea on a tree uprooted by a flood such as often\r\noccurs in tropical climates and especially during earthquakes. To some such\r\naccident we may perhaps attribute the presence of these creatures in the\r\nGalapagos, and that it is a very rare one is indicated by the fact that\r\nonly two species have as yet succeeded in obtaining a footing there.\r\n\r\n_Birds._--We now come to the birds, whose presence here may not seem so\r\nremarkable, but which yet present features of interest not exceeded by any\r\nother group. About seventy species of birds have now been obtained on these\r\nislands, and of these forty-one are peculiar to them. But all the species\r\nfound elsewhere, except one, belong to the aquatic tribes or the waders\r\nwhich are pre-eminently wanderers, yet even of these eight are peculiar.\r\nThe true land-birds are forty-two in number, and all but one are entirely\r\nconfined to the Galapagos; while three-fourths of them present such\r\npeculiarities that they are classed in distinct genera. All are allied to\r\nbirds inhabiting tropical America, some very closely; while one--the common\r\nAmerican rice-bird which ranges over the whole northern and part of the\r\nsouthern continents--is the only land-bird identical with those of the\r\nmainland. The following is a list of these land-birds taken from Mr.\r\nSalvin's memoir in the _Transactions of the Zoological Society_ for the\r\nyear 1876, to which are added nine species collected in 1888 and {281}\r\ndescribed by Mr. Ridgway in the _Proceedings of the U.S. National Museum_\r\n(XII. p. 101) and some additional species obtained in 1889.\r\n\r\n  TURDIDAE.\r\n\r\n  1.

The excessively abundant\r\nrice-bird, which breeds in Canada and swarms over the whole United States,\r\nmigrating to the West Indies and South America, visiting the distant\r\nBermudas almost every year, and extending its range as far as Paraguay, is\r\nthe only species of land-bird which remains completely unchanged in the\r\nGalapagos; and we may therefore conclude that some stragglers of the\r\nmigrating host reach the islands sufficiently often to keep up the purity\r\nof the breed. Next, we have the almost cosmopolite short-eared owl (_Asio\r\nbrachyotus_), which ranges from China to Ireland, and from Greenland to the\r\nStraits of Magellan, and of this the Galapagos bird is probably only one of\r\nthe numerous varieties. The little wood warbler (_Dendroeca aureola_) is\r\nclosely allied to a species which {283} ranges over the whole of North\r\nAmerica and as far south as New Grenada. It has also been occasionally met\r\nwith in Bermuda, an indication that it has considerable powers of flight\r\nand endurance. The more distinct _species_--as the tyrant fly-catchers\r\n(Pyrocephalus and Myiarchus), the ground-dove (Zenaida), and the buzzard\r\n(Buteo), are all allied to non-migratory species peculiar to tropical\r\nAmerica, and of a more restricted range; while the distinct _genera_ are\r\nallied to South American groups of thrushes, finches, and sugar-birds which\r\nhave usually restricted ranges, and whose habits are such as not to render\r\nthem likely to be carried out to sea. The remote ancestral forms of these\r\nbirds which, owing to some exceptional causes, reached the Galapagos, have\r\nthus remained uninfluenced by later migrations, and have, in consequence,\r\nbeen developed into a variety of distinct types adapted to the peculiar\r\nconditions of existence under which they have been placed. Sometimes the\r\ndifferent species thus formed are confined to one or two of the islands\r\nonly, as the three species of Certhidea, which are divided between the\r\nislands but do not appear ever to occur together. _Nesomimus parvulus_ is\r\nconfined to Albemarle Island, and _N. trifasciatus_ to Charles Island;\r\n_Cactornis pallida_ to Indefatigable Island, _C. brevirostris_ to Chatham\r\nIsland, and _C. abingdoni_ to Abingdon Island.\r\n\r\nNow all these phenomena are strictly consistent with the theory of the\r\npeopling of the islands by accidental migrations, if we only allow them to\r\nhave existed for a sufficiently long period; and the fact that volcanic\r\naction has ceased on many of the islands, as well as their great extent,\r\nwould certainly indicate a considerable antiquity.\r\n\r\nThe great difference presented by the birds of these islands as compared\r\nwith those of the equally remote Azores and Bermudas, is sufficiently\r\nexplained by the difference of climatal conditions. At the Galapagos there\r\nare none of those periodic storms, gales, and hurricanes which prevail in\r\nthe North Atlantic, and which every year carry some straggling birds of\r\nEurope or North America to the former islands; while, at the same time, the\r\nmajority of the tropical American birds are {284} nonmigratory, and thus\r\nafford none of the opportunities presented by the countless hosts of\r\nmigrants which pass annually northward and southward along the European,\r\nand especially along the North American coasts. It is strictly in\r\naccordance with these different conditions that we find in one case an\r\nalmost perfect identity with, and in the other an almost equally complete\r\ndiversity from, the continental species of birds.\r\n\r\n_Insects and Land-shells._--The other groups of land-animals add little of\r\nimportance to the facts already referred to. The insects are very scanty;\r\nthe most plentiful group, the beetles, only furnishing about forty species\r\nbelonging to thirty-two genera and nineteen families. The species are\r\nalmost all peculiar, as are some of the genera. They are mostly small and\r\nobscure insects, allied either to American or to world-wide groups. The\r\nCarabidae and the Heteromera are the most abundant groups, the former\r\nfurnishing six and the latter nine species.[61]\r\n\r\n{285}\r\n\r\nThe land-shells are not abundant--about twenty in all, most of them\r\npeculiar species, but not otherwise remarkable. The observation of Captain\r\nCollnet, quoted by Mr. Darwin in his _Journal_, that drift-wood, bamboos,\r\ncanes, and the nuts of a palm, are often washed on the south-eastern shores\r\nof the islands, furnishes an excellent clue to the manner in which many of\r\nthe insects and land-shells may have reached the Galapagos. Whirlwinds also\r\nhave been known to carry quantities of leaves and other vegetable _debris_\r\nto great heights in the air, and these might be then carried away by strong\r\nupper currents and dropped at great distances, and with them small insects\r\nand mollusca, or their eggs. We must also remember that volcanic islands\r\nare subject to subsidence as well as elevation; and it is quite possible\r\nthat during the long period the Galapagos have existed some islands may\r\nhave intervened between them and the coast, and have served as\r\nstepping-stones by which the passage to them of various organisms would be\r\ngreatly facilitated. Sunken banks, the relics of such islands, are known to\r\nexist in many parts of the ocean, and countless others, no doubt, remain\r\nundiscovered.\r\n\r\n_The Keeling Islands as Illustrating the Manner in which Oceanic Islands\r\nare Peopled._--That such causes as have been here adduced are those by\r\nwhich oceanic islands have been peopled, is further shown by the condition\r\nof equally remote islands which we know are of comparatively recent origin.\r\nSuch are the Keeling or Cocos Islands in the Indian Ocean, situated about\r\nthe same distance from Sumatra as the Galapagos from South America, but\r\nmere coral reefs, supporting abundance of cocoa-nut palms as their chief\r\nvegetation. These islands were visited by Mr. {286} Darwin, and their\r\nnatural history carefully examined. The only mammals are rats, brought by a\r\nwrecked vessel and said by Mr. Waterhouse to be common English rats, \"but\r\nsmaller and more brightly coloured;\" so that we have here an illustration\r\nof how soon a difference of race is established under a constant and\r\nuniform difference of conditions. There are no true land-birds, but there\r\nare snipes and rails, both apparently common Malayan species. Reptiles are\r\nrepresented by one small lizard, but no account of this is given in the\r\n_Zoology of the Voyage of the Beagle_, and we may therefore conclude that\r\nit was an introduced species. Of insects, careful collecting only produced\r\nthirteen species belonging to eight distinct orders. The only beetle was a\r\nsmall Elater, the Orthoptera were a Gryllus and a Blatta; and there were\r\ntwo flies, two ants, and two small moths, one a Diopaea which swarms\r\neverywhere in the eastern tropics in grassy places. All these insects were\r\nno doubt brought either by winds, by floating timber (which reaches the\r\nislands abundantly), or by clinging to the feathers of aquatic or wading\r\nbirds; and we only require more time to introduce a greater variety of\r\nspecies, and a better soil and more varied vegetation, to enable them to\r\nlive and multiply, in order to give these islands a fauna and flora equal\r\nto that of the Bermudas. Of wild plants there were only twenty species,\r\nbelonging to nineteen genera and to no less than sixteen natural families,\r\nwhile all were common tropical shore plants.[62] These islands are thus\r\nevidently stocked by waifs and strays brought by the winds and waves; but\r\ntheir scanty vegetation is mainly due to unfavourable conditions--the\r\nbarren coral rock and sand, of which they are wholly composed, together\r\nwith exposure to sea-air, being suitable to a very limited number of\r\nspecies which soon monopolise the surface. With more variety of soil and\r\naspect a greater variety of plants would establish themselves, and these\r\nwould favour the preservation and increase of more insects, birds, and\r\n{287} other animals, as we find to be the case in many small and remote\r\nislands.[63]\r\n\r\n_Flora of the Galapagos._--The plants of these islands are so much more\r\nnumerous than the known animals, even including the insects, they have been\r\nso carefully studied by eminent botanists, and their relations throw so\r\nmuch light on the past history of the group, that no apology is needed for\r\ngiving a brief outline of the peculiarities and affinities of the flora.\r\nThe statements we shall make on this subject will be taken from the Memoir\r\nof Sir Joseph Hooker in the _Linnaean Transactions_ for 1851, founded on\r\nMr. Darwin's collections, and a later paper by N. J. Andersson in the\r\n_Linnaea_ of 1861, embodying more recent discoveries. {288}\r\n\r\nThe total number of flowering plants known at the latter date was 332, of\r\nwhich 174 were peculiar to the islands, while 158 were common to other\r\ncountries.[64] Of these latter about twenty have been introduced by man,\r\nwhile the remainder are all natives of some part of America, though about a\r\nthird part are species of wide range extending into both hemispheres. Of\r\nthose confined to America, forty-two are found in both the northern and\r\nsouthern continents, twenty-one are confined to South America, while twenty\r\nare found only in North America, the West Indies, or Mexico. This equality\r\nof North American and South American species in the Galapagos is a fact of\r\ngreat significance in connection with the observation of Sir Joseph Hooker\r\nthat the _peculiar_ species are allied to the plants of temperate America\r\nor to those of the high Andes, while the non-peculiar species are mostly\r\nsuch as inhabit the hotter regions of the tropics near the level of the\r\nsea. He also observes that the seeds of this latter class of Galapagos\r\nplants often have special means of transport, or belong to groups whose\r\nseeds are known to stand long voyages and to possess great vitality. Mr.\r\nBentham also, in his elaborate account of the Compositae,[65] remarks on\r\nthe decided Central American or Mexican affinities of the Galapagos\r\nspecies, so that we may consider this to be a thoroughly well-established\r\nfact.\r\n\r\nThe most prevalent families of plants in the Galapagos are the Compositae\r\n(40 sp.), Gramineae (32 sp.), Leguminosae (30 sp.), and Euphorbiaceae (29\r\nsp.). Of the Compositae most of the species, except such as are common\r\nweeds or shore plants, are peculiar, but there are only two peculiar\r\ngenera, allied to Mexican forms and not very distinct; while the genus\r\nLipochaeta, represented here by a single species, is only found elsewhere\r\nin the Sandwich Islands though it has American affinities.\r\n\r\n_Origin of the Galapagos Flora._--These facts are explained by the past\r\nhistory of the American continent, its {289} separation at various epochs\r\nby arms of the sea uniting the two oceans across what is now Central\r\nAmerica (the last separation being of recent date, as shown by the\r\nconsiderable number of identical species of fishes on both sides of the\r\nisthmus), and the influence of the glacial epoch in driving the temperate\r\nAmerican flora southward along the mountain plateaus.[66] At the time when\r\nthe two oceans were united a portion of the Gulf Stream may have been\r\ndiverted into the Pacific, giving rise to a current, some part of which\r\nwould almost certainly have reached the Galapagos, and this may have helped\r\nto bring about that singular assemblage of West Indian and Mexican plants\r\nnow found there. And as we now believe that the duration of the last\r\nglacial epoch in its successive phases was much longer than the time which\r\nhas elapsed since it finally passed away, while throughout the Miocene\r\nepoch the snow-line would often be lowered during periods of high\r\nexcentricity, we are enabled to comprehend the nature of the causes which\r\nmay have led to the islands being stocked with those north tropical or\r\nmountain types which are so characteristic a feature of that portion of the\r\nGalapagos flora which consists of peculiar species.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, the flora agrees with the fauna in indicating a moderately\r\nremote origin, great isolation, and changes of conditions affording\r\nfacilities for the introduction of organisms from various parts of the\r\nAmerican coast, and even from the West Indian Islands and Gulf of Mexico.\r\nAs in the case of the birds, the several islands differ considerably in\r\ntheir native plants, many species being limited to one or two islands only,\r\nwhile others extend to several. This is, of course, what might be expected\r\non any theory of their origin; because, even if the whole of the islands\r\nhad once been united and afterwards separated, long continued isolation\r\nwould often lead to the differentiation of species, while the varied\r\nconditions to be found upon islands differing in size and altitude as well\r\nas in luxuriance of vegetation, would often lead to the extinction of a\r\nspecies on one island and its preservation on another. If the several\r\nislands had been equally well {290} explored, it might be interesting to\r\nsee whether, as in the case of the Azores, the number of species diminished\r\nin those more remote from the coast; but unfortunately our knowledge of the\r\nproductions of the various islands of the group is exceedingly unequal,\r\nand, except in those cases in which representative species inhabit distinct\r\nislands, we have no certainty on the subject. All the more interesting\r\nproblems in geographical distribution, however, arise from the relation of\r\nthe fauna and flora of the group as a whole to those of the surrounding\r\ncontinents, and we shall therefore for the most part confine ourselves to\r\nthis aspect of the question in our discussion of the phenomena presented by\r\noceanic or continental islands.\r\n\r\n_Concluding Remarks._--The Galapagos offer an instructive contrast with the\r\nAzores, showing how a difference of conditions that might be thought\r\nunimportant may yet produce very striking results in the forms of life.\r\nAlthough the Galapagos are much nearer a continent than the Azores, the\r\nnumber of species of plants common to the continent is much less in the\r\nformer case than in the latter, and this is still more prominent a\r\ncharacteristic of the insect and the bird faunas. This difference has been\r\nshown to depend, almost entirely, on the one archipelago being situated in\r\na stormy, the other in a calm portion of the ocean; and it demonstrates the\r\npreponderating importance of the atmosphere as an agent in the dispersal of\r\nbirds, insects, and plants. Yet ocean-currents and surface-drifts are\r\nundoubtedly efficient carriers of plants, and, with plants, of insects and\r\nshells, especially in the tropics; and it is probably to this agency that\r\nwe may impute the recent introduction of a number of common Peruvian and\r\nChilian littoral species, and also of several West Indian types at a more\r\nremote period when the Isthmus of Panama was submerged.\r\n\r\nIn the case of these islands we see the importance of taking account of\r\npast conditions of sea and land and past changes of climate, in order to\r\nexplain the relations of the peculiar or endemic species of their fauna and\r\nflora; and we may even see an indication of the effects of climatal changes\r\nin the northern hemisphere, in the north {291} temperate or alpine\r\naffinities of many of the plants, and even of some of the birds. The\r\nrelation between the migratory habits of the birds and the amount of\r\ndifference from continental types is strikingly accordant with the fact\r\nthat it is almost exclusively migratory birds that annually reach the\r\nAzores and Bermuda; while the corresponding fact that the seeds of those\r\nplants, which are common to the Galapagos and the adjacent continent, have\r\nall--as Sir Joseph Hooker states--some special means of dispersal, is\r\nequally intelligible. The reason why the Galapagos possess four times as\r\nmany peculiar species of plants as the Azores is clearly a result of the\r\nless constant introduction of seeds, owing to the absence of storms; the\r\ngreater antiquity of the group, allowing more time for specific change; and\r\nthe influence of cold epochs and of alterations of sea and land, in\r\nbringing somewhat different sets of plants at different times within the\r\ninfluence of such modified winds and currents as might convey them to the\r\nislands.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, then, we have no difficulty in explaining the probable origin\r\nof the flora and fauna of the Galapagos, by means of the illustrative facts\r\nand general principles already adduced.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{292}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nST.

Both, too, have received considerable attention from\r\nnaturalists; and though much still remains to be done in the latter group,\r\nour knowledge is sufficient to enable us to arrive at many interesting\r\nresults.\r\n\r\n{293} [Illustration: MAP OF THE SOUTH ATLANTIC OCEAN SHOWING THE POSITION\r\nOF ST. HELENA.]\r\n\r\n  The light tint shows depths of less than 1,000 fathoms.\r\n  The figures show depths of the sea in fathoms.\r\n\r\n_Position and Physical Features of St. Helena._--This island is situated\r\nnearly in the middle of the South Atlantic Ocean, being more than 1,100\r\nmiles from the coast of Africa, and 1,800 from South America. It is about\r\nten miles long by eight wide, and is wholly volcanic, consisting of ancient\r\nbasalts, lavas, and other volcanic products. It is very mountainous and\r\nrugged, bounded for {294} the most part by enormous precipices, and rising\r\nto a height of 2,700 feet above the sea-level. An ancient crater, about\r\nfour miles across, is open on the south side, and its northern rim forms\r\nthe highest and central ridge of the island. Many other hills and peaks,\r\nhowever, are more than two thousand feet high, and a considerable portion\r\nof the surface consists of a rugged plateau, having an elevation of about\r\nfifteen hundred to two thousand feet. Everything indicates that St. Helena\r\nis an isolated volcanic mass built up from the depths of the ocean. Mr.\r\nWollaston remarks: \"There are the strongest reasons for believing that the\r\narea of St. Helena was never _very_ much larger than it is at present--the\r\ncomparatively shallow sea-soundings within about a mile and a half from the\r\nshore revealing an abruptly defined ledge, _beyond_ which no bottom is\r\nreached at a depth of 250 fathoms; so that the original basaltic mass,\r\nwhich was gradually piled up by means of successive eruptions from beneath\r\nthe ocean, would appear to have its limit definitely marked out by this\r\nsuddenly-terminating submarine cliff--the space between it and the existing\r\ncoast-line being reasonably referred to that slow process of disintegration\r\nby which the island has been reduced, through the eroding action of the\r\nelements, to its present dimensions.\" If we add to this that between the\r\nisland and the coast of Africa, in a south-easterly direction, is a\r\nprofound oceanic gulf known to reach a depth of 2,860 fathoms, or 17,160\r\nfeet, while an equally deep, or perhaps deeper, ocean, extends to the west\r\nand south-west, we shall be satisfied that St. Helena is a true oceanic\r\nisland, and that it owes none of its peculiarities to a former union with\r\nany continent or other distant land.\r\n\r\n_Change Effected by European Occupation._--When first discovered, in the\r\nyear 1501, St. Helena was densely covered with a luxuriant forest\r\nvegetation, the trees overhanging the seaward precipices and covering every\r\npart of the surface with an evergreen mantle. This indigenous vegetation\r\nhas been almost wholly destroyed; and although an immense number of foreign\r\nplants have been introduced, and have more or less completely established\r\nthemselves, {295} yet the general aspect of the island is now so barren and\r\nforbidding that some persons find it difficult to believe that it was once\r\nall green and fertile. The cause of the change is, however, very easily\r\nexplained. The rich soil formed by decomposed volcanic rock and vegetable\r\ndeposits could only be retained on the steep slopes so long as it was\r\nprotected by the vegetation to which it in great part owed its origin. When\r\nthis was destroyed, the heavy tropical rains soon washed away the soil, and\r\nhas left a vast expanse of bare rock or sterile clay. This irreparable\r\ndestruction was caused in the first place by goats, which were introduced\r\nby the Portuguese in 1513, and increased so rapidly that in 1588, they\r\nexisted in thousands. These animals are the greatest of all foes to trees,\r\nbecause they eat off the young seedlings, and thus prevent the natural\r\nrestoration of the forest. They were, however, aided by the reckless waste\r\nof man. The East India Company took possession of the island in 1651, and\r\nabout the year 1700 it began to be seen that the forests were fast\r\ndiminishing, and required some protection. Two of the native trees, redwood\r\nand ebony, were good for tanning, and to save trouble the bark was\r\nwastefully stripped from the trunks only, the remainder being left to rot;\r\nwhile in 1709 a large quantity of the rapidly disappearing ebony was used\r\nto burn lime for building fortifications! By the MSS. records quoted in Mr.\r\nMelliss' interesting volume on St. Helena,[67] it is evident that the evil\r\nconsequences of allowing the trees to be destroyed were clearly foreseen,\r\nas the following passages show: \"We find the place called the Great Wood in\r\na flourishing condition, full of young trees, where the hoggs (of which\r\nthere is a great abundance) do not come to root them up. But the Great Wood\r\nis miserably lessened and destroyed within our memories, and is not near\r\nthe circuit and length it was. But we believe it does not contain now less\r\nthan fifteen hundred acres of fine woodland and good ground, but no springs\r\nof water but what is salt or brackish, which we take to be the reason that\r\nthat part was not inhabited when the people first {296} chose out their\r\nsettlements and made plantations; but if wells could be sunk, which the\r\ngovernor says he will attempt when we have more hands, we should then think\r\nit the most pleasant and healthiest part of the island. But as to\r\nhealthiness, we don't think it will hold so if the wood that keeps the land\r\nwarm were destroyed, for then the rains, which are violent here, would\r\ncarry away the upper soil, and it being a clay marl underneath would\r\nproduce but little; as it is, we think in case it were enclosed it might be\r\ngreatly improved\" ... \"When once this wood is gone the island will soon be\r\nruined\" ... \"We viewed the wood's end which joins the Honourable Company's\r\nplantation called the Hutts, but the wood is so destroyed that the\r\nbeginning of the Great Wood is now a whole mile beyond that place, and all\r\nthe soil between being washed away, that distance is now entirely barren.\"\r\n(MSS. records, 1716.) In 1709 the governor reported to the Court of\r\nDirectors of the East India Company that the timber was rapidly\r\ndisappearing, and that the goats should be destroyed for the preservation\r\nof the ebony wood, and because the island was suffering from droughts. The\r\nreply was, \"The goats are not to be destroyed, being more valuable than\r\nebony.\" Thus, through the gross ignorance of those in power, the last\r\nopportunity of preserving the peculiar vegetation of St. Helena, and\r\npreventing the island from becoming the comparatively rocky desert it now\r\nis, was allowed to pass away.[68] Even in a mere {297} pecuniary point of\r\nview the error was a fatal one, for in the next century (in 1810) another\r\ngovernor reports the total destruction of the great forests by the goats,\r\nand that in consequence the cost of importing fuel for government use was\r\n2,729l. 7s. 8d. for a single year! About this time large numbers of\r\nEuropean, American, Australian, and South African plants were imported, and\r\nmany of these ran wild and increased so rapidly as to drive out and\r\nexterminate much of the relics of the native flora; so that now English\r\nbroom gorse and brambles, willows and poplars, and some common American,\r\nCape, and Australian weeds, alone meet the eye of the ordinary visitor.\r\nThese, in Sir Joseph Hooker's opinion, render it absolutely impossible to\r\nrestore the native flora, which only lingers in a few of the loftiest\r\nridges and most inaccessible precipices, and is rarely seen except by some\r\nexploring naturalist.\r\n\r\nThis almost total extirpation of a luxuriant and highly peculiar vegetation\r\nmust inevitably have caused the destruction of a considerable portion of\r\nthe lower animals which once existed on the island, and it is rather\r\nsingular that so much as has actually been discovered should be left to\r\nshow us the nature of the aboriginal fauna. Many naturalists have made\r\nsmall collections during short visits, but we owe our present complete\r\nknowledge of the two most interesting groups of animals, the insects, and\r\nthe land-shells, mainly to the late Mr. T. Vernon Wollaston, who, after\r\nhaving thoroughly explored Madeira and the Canaries, undertook a voyage to\r\nSt. Helena for the express purpose of studying its terrestrial fauna, and\r\nresided for six months (1875-76) in a high central position, whence the\r\nloftiest peaks could be explored. The results of his labours are contained\r\nin two volumes,[69] which, like all that he wrote, are models of accuracy\r\nand research, and it is to these volumes that we are indebted for the\r\ninteresting and suggestive facts which we here lay before our readers.\r\n\r\n{298}\r\n\r\n_Insects--Coleoptera._--The total number of species of beetles hitherto\r\nobserved at St. Helena is 203, but of these no less than seventy-four are\r\ncommon and wide-spread insects, which have certainly, in Mr. Wollaston's\r\nopinion, been introduced by human agency. There remain 129 which are\r\nbelieved to be truly aborigines, and of these all but one are found nowhere\r\nelse on the globe. But in addition to this large amount of specific\r\npeculiarity (perhaps unequalled anywhere else in the world) the beetles of\r\nthis island are equally remarkable for their generic isolation, and for the\r\naltogether exceptional proportion in which the great divisions of the order\r\nare represented. The species belong to thirty-nine genera, of which no less\r\nthan twenty-five are peculiar to the island; and many of these are such\r\nisolated forms that it is impossible to find their allies in any particular\r\ncountry. Still more remarkable is the fact, that more than two-thirds of\r\nthe whole number of indigenous species are Rhyncophora or weevils, while\r\nmore than two-fifths (fifty-four species) belong to one family, the\r\nCossonidae. Now although the Rhyncophora are an immensely numerous group\r\nand always form a large portion of the insect population, they nowhere else\r\napproach such a proportion as this. For example, in Madeira they form\r\none-sixth of the whole of the indigenous Coleoptera, in the Azores less\r\nthan one-tenth, and in Britain one-seventh. Even more interesting is the\r\nfact that the twenty genera to which these insects belong are every one of\r\nthem peculiar to the island, and in many cases have no near allies\r\nelsewhere, so that we cannot but look on this group of beetles as forming\r\nthe most characteristic portion of the ancient insect fauna. Now, as the\r\ngreat majority of these are wood borers, and all are closely attached to\r\nvegetation and often to particular species of plants, we might, as Mr.\r\nWollaston well observes, deduce the former luxuriant vegetation of the\r\nisland from the great preponderance of this group, even had we not positive\r\nevidence that it was at no distant epoch densely forest-clad. We will now\r\nproceed briefly to indicate the numbers and peculiarities of each of the\r\nfamilies of beetles which enter into the St. Helena fauna, taking them, not\r\nin {299} systematic order, but according to their importance in the island.\r\n\r\n1. RHYNCOPHORA.--This great division includes the weevils and allied\r\ngroups, and, as above stated, exceeds in number of species all the other\r\nbeetles of the island. Four families are represented; the Cossonidae, with\r\nfifteen peculiar genera comprising fifty-four species, and one minute\r\ninsect (_Stenoscelis hylastoides_) forming a peculiar genus, but which has\r\nbeen found also at the Cape of Good Hope. It is therefore impossible to say\r\nof which country it is really a native, or whether it is indigenous to\r\nboth, and dates back to the remote period when St. Helena received its\r\nearly emigrants. All the Cossonidae are found in the highest and wildest\r\nparts of the island where the native vegetation still lingers, and many of\r\nthem are only found in the decaying stems of tree-ferns, box-wood,\r\narborescent Compositae, and other indigenous plants. They are all\r\npre-eminently peculiar and isolated, having no direct affinity to species\r\nfound in any other country. The next family, the Tanyrhynchidae, has one\r\npeculiar genus in St. Helena, with ten species. This genus (Nesiotes) is\r\nremotely allied to European, Australian, and Madeiran insects of the same\r\nfamily: the habits of the species are similar to those of the Cossonidae.\r\nThe Trachyphloeidae are represented by a single species belonging to a\r\npeculiar genus not very remote from a European form. The Anthribidae again\r\nare highly peculiar. There are twenty-six species belonging to three\r\ngenera, all endemic, and so extremely peculiar that they form two new\r\nsubfamilies. One of the genera, Acarodes, is said to be allied to a\r\nMadeiran genus.\r\n\r\n2. GEODEPHAGA.--These are the terrestrial carnivorous beetles, very\r\nabundant in all parts of the world, especially in the temperate regions of\r\nthe northern hemisphere. In St. Helena there are fourteen species belonging\r\nto three genera, one of which is peculiar. This is the _Haplothorax\r\nburchellii_, the largest beetle on the island, and now very rare. It\r\nresembles a large black Carabus. There is also a peculiar Calosoma, very\r\ndistinct, though resembling in some respects certain African species. The\r\nrest of the {300} Geodephaga, twelve in number, belong to the wide-spread\r\ngenus Bembidium, but they are altogether peculiar and isolated, except one,\r\nwhich is of European type, and alone has wings, all the rest being\r\nwingless.\r\n\r\n3. HETEROMERA.--This group is represented by three peculiar genera\r\ncontaining four species, with two species belonging to European genera.\r\nThey belong to the families Opatridae, Mordellidae, and Anthicidae.\r\n\r\n4. BRACHYELYTRA.--Of this group there are six peculiar species belonging to\r\nfour European genera--Homalota, Philonthus, Xantholinus, and Oxytelus.\r\n\r\n5. PRIOCERATA.--The families Elateridae and Anobiidae are each represented\r\nby a peculiar species of a European genus.\r\n\r\n6. PHYTOPHAGA.--There are only three species of this tribe, belonging to\r\nthe European genus Longitarsus.\r\n\r\n7. LAMELLICORNIS.--Here are three species belonging to two genera. One is a\r\npeculiar species of Trox, allied to South African forms; the other two\r\nbelong to the peculiar genus Melissius, which Mr. Wollaston considers to be\r\nremotely allied to Australian insects.\r\n\r\n8. PSEUDO-TRIMERA.--Here we have the fine lady-bird _Chilomenus lunata_,\r\nalso found in Africa, but apparently indigenous in St. Helena; and a\r\npeculiar species of Euxestes, a genus only found elsewhere in Madeira.\r\n\r\n9. TRICHOPTERYGIDAE.--These, the minutest of beetles, are represented by\r\none species of the European and Madeiran genus Ptinella.\r\n\r\n10. NECROPHAGA.--One indigenous species of Cryptophaga inhabits St. Helena,\r\nand this is said to be very closely allied to a Cape species.\r\n\r\n_Peculiarities and Origin of the Coleoptera of St. Helena._--We see that\r\nthe great mass of the indigenous species are not only peculiar to the\r\nisland, but so isolated in their characters as to show no close affinity\r\nwith any existing insects; while a small number (about one-third of the\r\nwhole) have some relations, though often very remote, with species now\r\ninhabiting Europe, Madeira, or South Africa. These facts clearly point to\r\nthe very great antiquity of the insect fauna of St. Helena, which has\r\nallowed {301} time for the modification of the originally introduced\r\nspecies, and their special adaptation to the conditions prevailing in this\r\nremote island. This antiquity is also shown by the remarkable specific\r\nmodification of a few types. Thus the whole of the Cossonidae may be\r\nreferred to three types, one species only (_Hexacoptus ferrugineus_) being\r\nallied to the European Cossonidae though forming a distinct genus; a group\r\nof three genera and seven species remotely allied to the _Stenoscelis\r\nhylastoides_, which occurs also at the Cape; while a group of twelve genera\r\nwith forty-six species have their only (remote) allies in a few insects\r\nwidely scattered in South Africa, New Zealand, Europe, and the Atlantic\r\nIslands. In like manner, eleven species of Bembidium form a group by\r\nthemselves; and the Heteromera form two groups, one consisting of three\r\ngenera and species of Opatridae allied to a type found in Madeira, the\r\nother, Anthicodes, altogether peculiar.\r\n\r\nNow each of these types may well be descended from a single species which\r\noriginally reached the island from some other land; and the great variety\r\nof generic and specific forms into which some of them have diverged is an\r\nindication, and to some extent a measure, of the remoteness of their\r\norigin. The rich insect fauna of Miocene age found in Switzerland consists\r\nmostly of genera which still inhabit Europe, with others which now inhabit\r\nthe Cape of Good Hope or the tropics of Africa and South America; and it is\r\nnot at all improbable that the origin of the St. Helena fauna dates back to\r\nat least as remote, and not improbably to a still earlier, epoch. But if\r\nso, many difficulties in accounting for its origin will disappear. We know\r\nthat at that time many of the animals and plants of the tropics, of North\r\nAmerica, and even of Australia, inhabited Europe; while during the changes\r\nof climate, which, as we have seen, there is good reason to believe\r\nperiodically occurred, there would be much migration from the temperate\r\nzones towards the equator, and the reverse. If, therefore, the nearest ally\r\nof any insular group now inhabits a particular country, we are not obliged\r\nto suppose that it reached the island from that country, since we know that\r\nmost groups have ranged in past times over {302} wider areas than they now\r\ninhabit. Neither are we limited to the means of transmission across the\r\nocean that now exist, because we know that those means have varied greatly.\r\nDuring such extreme changes of conditions as are implied by glacial periods\r\nand by warm polar climates, great alterations of winds and of\r\nocean-currents are inevitable, and these are, as we have already proved,\r\nthe two great agencies by which the transmission of living things to\r\noceanic islands has been brought about. At the present time the south-east\r\ntrade-winds blow almost constantly at St. Helena, and the ocean-currents\r\nflow in the same direction, so that any transmission of insects by their\r\nmeans must almost certainly be from South Africa. Now there is undoubtedly\r\na South African element in the insect-fauna, but there is no less clearly a\r\nEuropean, or at least a north-temperate element, and this is very difficult\r\nto account for by causes now in action. But when we consider that this\r\nnorthern element is chiefly represented by remote generic affinity, and has\r\ntherefore all the signs of great antiquity, we find a possible means of\r\naccounting for it. We have seen that during early Tertiary times an almost\r\ntropical climate extended far into the northern hemisphere, and a temperate\r\nclimate to the Arctic regions. But if at this time (as is not improbable)\r\nthe Antarctic regions were as much ice-clad as they are now it is certain\r\nthat an enormous change must have been produced in the winds. Instead of a\r\ngreat difference of temperature between each pole and the equator, the\r\ndifference would be mainly between one hemisphere and the other, and this\r\nmight so disturb the trade winds as to bring St. Helena within the south\r\ntemperate region of storms--a position corresponding to that of the Azores\r\nand Madeira in the North Atlantic, and thus subject it to violent gales\r\nfrom all points of the compass. At this remote epoch the mountains of\r\nequatorial Africa may have been more extensive than they are now, and may\r\nhave served as intermediate stations by which some northern insects may\r\nhave migrated to the southern hemisphere.\r\n\r\nWe must remember also that these peculiar forms are said to be northern\r\nonly because their nearest allies are {303} now found in the North Atlantic\r\nislands and Southern Europe; but it is not at all improbable that they are\r\nreally widespread Miocene types, which have been preserved mainly in\r\nfavourable insular stations. They may therefore have originally reached St.\r\nHelena from Southern Africa, or from some of the Atlantic islands, and may\r\nhave been conveyed by oceanic currents as well as by winds.[70] This is the\r\nmore probable, as a large proportion of the St. Helena beetles live even in\r\nthe perfect state within the stems of plants or trunks of trees, while the\r\neggs and larvae of a still larger number are likely to inhabit similar\r\nstations. Drift-wood might therefore be one of the most important agencies\r\nby which these insects reached the island.\r\n\r\nLet us now see how far the distribution of other groups support the\r\nconclusions derived from a consideration of the beetles. The Hemiptera have\r\nbeen studied by Dr. F. Buchanan White, and though far less known than the\r\nbeetles, indicate somewhat similar relations. Eight out of twenty-one\r\ngenera are peculiar, and the thirteen other genera are for the most part\r\nwidely distributed, while one of the peculiar genera is of African type.\r\nThe other orders of insects have not been collected or studied with {304}\r\nsufficient care to make it worth while to refer to them in detail; but the\r\nland-shells have been carefully collected and minutely described by Mr.\r\nWollaston himself, and it is interesting to see how far they agree with the\r\ninsects in their peculiarities and affinities.\r\n\r\n_Land-shells of St. Helena._--The total number of species is only\r\ntwenty-nine, of which seven are common in Europe or the other Atlantic\r\nislands, and are no doubt recent introductions. Two others, though\r\ndescribed as distinct, are so closely allied to European forms, that Mr.\r\nWollaston thinks they have probably been introduced and have become\r\nslightly modified by new conditions of life; so that there remain exactly\r\ntwenty species which may be considered truly indigenous. No less than\r\nthirteen of these, however, appear to be extinct, being now only found on\r\nthe surface of the ground or in the surface soil in places where the native\r\nforests have been destroyed and the land not cultivated. These twenty\r\npeculiar species belong to the following genera: Hyalina (3 sp.), Patula (4\r\nsp.), Bulimus (7 sp.), Subulina (3 sp.), Succinea (3 sp.); of which, one\r\nspecies of Hyalina, three of Patula, all the Bulimi, and two of Subulina\r\nare extinct. The three Hyalinas are allied to European species, but all the\r\nrest appear to be highly peculiar, and to have no near allies with the\r\nspecies of any other country. Two of the Bulimi (_B. auris vulpinae_ and\r\n_B. darwinianus_) are said to somewhat resemble Brazilian, New Zealand, and\r\nSolomon Island forms, while neither Bulimus nor Succinea occur at all in\r\nthe Madeira group.\r\n\r\nOmitting the species that have probably been introduced by human agency, we\r\nhave here indications of a somewhat recent immigration of European types\r\nwhich may perhaps be referred to the glacial period; and a much more\r\nancient immigration from unknown lands, which must certainly date back to\r\nMiocene, if not to Eocene, times.\r\n\r\n_Absence of Fresh-water Organisms._--A singular phenomenon is the total\r\nabsence of indigenous aquatic forms of life in St. Helena. Not a single\r\nwater-beetle or fresh-water shell has been discovered; neither do there\r\nseem to be any water-plants in the streams, except the common {305}\r\nwater-cress, one or two species of Cyperus, and the Australian _Isapis\r\nprolifera_. The same absence of fresh-water shells characterises the\r\nAzores, where, however, there is one indigenous water-beetle. In the\r\nSandwich Islands also recent observations refer to the absence of\r\nwater-beetles, though here there are a few fresh-water shells. It would\r\nappear therefore that the wide distribution of the same generic and\r\nspecific forms which so generally characterises fresh-water organisms, and\r\nwhich has been so well illustrated by Mr. Darwin, has its limits in the\r\n_very remote_ oceanic islands, owing to causes of which we are at present\r\nignorant.\r\n\r\nThe other classes of animals in St. Helena need occupy us little. There are\r\nno indigenous mammals, reptiles, fresh-water fishes or true land-birds; but\r\nthere is one species of wader--a small plover (_Aegialitis\r\nsanctae-helenae_)--very closely allied to a species found in South Africa,\r\nbut presenting certain differences which entitle it to the rank of a\r\npeculiar species. The plants, however, are of especial interest from a\r\ngeographical point of view, and we must devote a few pages to their\r\nconsideration as supplementing the scanty materials afforded by the animal\r\nlife, thus enabling us better to understand the biological relations and\r\nprobable history of the island.\r\n\r\n_Native Vegetation of St. Helena._--Plants have certainly more varied and\r\nmore effectual means of passing over wide tracts of ocean than any kinds of\r\nanimals. Their seeds are often so minute, of such small specific gravity,\r\nor so furnished with downy or winged appendages, as to be carried by the\r\nwind for enormous distances. The bristles or hooked spines of many small\r\nfruits cause them to become easily attached to the feathers of aquatic\r\nbirds, and they may thus be conveyed for thousands of miles by these\r\npre-eminent wanderers; while many seeds are so protected by hard outer\r\ncoats and dense inner albumen, that months of exposure to salt water does\r\nnot prevent them from germinating, as proved by the West Indian seeds that\r\nreach the Azores or even the west coast of Scotland, and, what is more to\r\nthe point, by the fact stated by Mr. Melliss, that large seeds which have\r\nfloated from {306} Madagascar or Mauritius round the Cape of Good Hope,\r\nhave been thrown on the shores of St. Helena and have then sometimes\r\ngerminated!\r\n\r\nWe have therefore little difficulty in understanding _how_ the island was\r\nfirst stocked with vegetable forms. _When_ it was so stocked (generally\r\nspeaking), is equally clear. For as the peculiar coleopterous fauna, of\r\nwhich an important fragment remains, is mainly composed of species which\r\nare specially attached to certain groups of plants, we may be sure that the\r\nplants were there long before the insects could establish themselves.\r\nHowever ancient then is the insect fauna the flora must be more ancient\r\nstill. It must also be remembered that plants, when once established in a\r\nsuitable climate and soil, soon take possession of a country and occupy it\r\nalmost to the complete exclusion of later immigrants. The fact of so many\r\nEuropean weeds having overrun New Zealand and temperate North America may\r\nseem opposed to this statement, but it really is not so. For in both these\r\ncases the native vegetation has first been artificially removed by man and\r\nthe ground cultivated; and there is no reason to believe that any similar\r\neffect would be produced by the scattering of any amount of foreign seed on\r\nground already completely clothed with an indigenous vegetation. We might\r\ntherefore conclude _a priori_, that the flora of such an island as St.\r\nHelena would be of an excessively ancient type, preserving for us in a\r\nslightly modified form examples of the vegetation of the globe at the time\r\nwhen the island first rose above the ocean. Let us see then what botanists\r\ntell us of its character and affinities.\r\n\r\nThe truly indigenous flowering plants are about fifty in number, besides\r\ntwenty-six ferns. Forty of the former and ten of the latter are absolutely\r\npeculiar to the island, and, as Sir Joseph Hooker tells us, \"with scarcely\r\nan exception, cannot be regarded as very close specific allies of any other\r\nplants at all. Seventeen of them belong to peculiar genera, and of the\r\nothers, all differ so markedly as species from their congeners, that not\r\none comes under the category of being an insular form of a continental\r\nspecies.\" The affinities of this flora are, Sir Joseph Hooker thinks, {307}\r\nmainly African and especially South African, as indicated by the presence\r\nof the genera Phylica, Pelargonium, Mesembryanthemum, Oteospermum, and\r\nWahlenbergia, which are eminently characteristic of southern extra-tropical\r\nAfrica. The sixteen ferns which are not peculiar are common either to\r\nAfrica, India, or America, a wide range sufficiently explained by the\r\ndust-like spores of ferns, capable of being carried to unknown distances by\r\nthe wind, and the great stability of their generic and specific forms, many\r\nof those found in the Miocene deposits of Switzerland, being hardly\r\ndistinguishable from living species. This shows, that identity of _species_\r\nof ferns between St. Helena and distant countries does not necessarily\r\nimply a recent origin.\r\n\r\n_The Relation of the St. Helena Compositae._--In an elaborate paper on the\r\nCompositae,[71] Mr. Bentham gives us some valuable remarks on the\r\naffinities of the seven endemic species belonging to the genera\r\nCommidendron, Melanodendron, Petrobium, and Pisiadia, which forms so\r\nimportant a portion of the existing flora of St. Helena. He says: \"Although\r\nnearer to Africa than to any other continent, those composite denizens\r\nwhich bear evidence of the greatest antiquity have their affinities for the\r\nmost part in South America, while the colonists of a more recent character\r\nare South African.\" ... \"Commidendron and Melanodendron are among the woody\r\nAsteroid forms exemplified in the Andine Diplostephium, and in the\r\nAustralian Olearia. Petrobium is one of three genera, remains of a group\r\nprobably of great antiquity, of which the two others are Podanthus in Chile\r\nand Astemma in the Andes. The Pisiadia is an endemic species of a genus\r\notherwise Mascarene or of Eastern Africa, presenting a geographical\r\nconnection analogous to that of the St. Helena Melhaniae,[72] with the\r\nMascarene Trochetia.\"\r\n\r\nWhenever such remote and singular cases of geographical affinity as the\r\nabove are pointed out, the first {308} impression is to imagine some mode\r\nby which a communication between the distant countries implicated might be\r\neffected; and this way of viewing the problem is almost universally\r\nadopted, even by naturalists. But if the principles laid down in this work\r\nand in my _Geographical Distribution of Animals_ are sound, such a course\r\nis very unphilosophical. For, on the theory of evolution, nothing can be\r\nmore certain than that groups now broken up and detached were once\r\ncontinuous, and that fragmentary groups and isolated forms are but the\r\nrelics of once widespread types, which have been preserved in a few\r\nlocalities where the physical conditions were especially favourable, or\r\nwhere organic competition was less severe. The true explanation of all such\r\nremote geographical affinities is, that they date back to a time when the\r\nancestral group of which they are the common descendants had a wider or a\r\ndifferent distribution; and they no more imply any closer connection\r\nbetween the distant countries the allied forms now inhabit, than does the\r\nexistence of living Equidae in South Africa and extinct Equidae in the\r\nPliocene deposits of the Pampas, imply a continent bridging the South\r\nAtlantic to allow of their easy communication.\r\n\r\n_Concluding Remarks on St. Helena._--The sketch we have now given of the\r\nchief members of the indigenous fauna and flora of St. Helena shows, that\r\nby means of the knowledge we have obtained of past changes in the physical\r\nhistory of the earth, and of the various modes by which organisms are\r\nconveyed across the ocean, all the more important facts become readily\r\nintelligible. We have here an island of small size and great antiquity,\r\nvery distant from every other land, and probably at no time very much less\r\ndistant from surrounding continents, which became stocked by chance\r\nimmigrants from other countries at some remote epoch, and which has\r\npreserved many of their more or less modified descendants to the present\r\ntime. When first visited by civilised man it was in all probability far\r\nmore richly stocked with plants and animals, forming a kind of natural\r\nmuseum or vivarium in which ancient types, perhaps dating back to the\r\nMiocene {309} period, or even earlier, had been saved from the destruction\r\nwhich has overtaken their allies on the great continents. Unfortunately\r\nmany, we do not know how many, of these forms have been exterminated by the\r\ncarelessness and improvidence of its civilised but ignorant rulers; and it\r\nis only by the extreme ruggedness and inaccessibility of its peaks and\r\ncrater-ridges that the scanty fragments have escaped by which alone we are\r\nable to obtain a glimpse of this interesting chapter in the life-history of\r\nour earth.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{310}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nTHE SANDWICH ISLANDS\r\n\r\n    Position and Physical Features--Zoology of the Sandwich\r\n    Islands--Birds--Reptiles--Land-shells--Insects--Vegetation of the\r\n    Sandwich Islands--Peculiar Features of the Hawaiian Flora--Antiquity of\r\n    the Hawaiian Fauna and Flora--Concluding Observations on the Fauna and\r\n    Flora of the Sandwich Islands--General Remarks on Oceanic Islands.\r\n\r\nThe Sandwich Islands are an extensive group of large islands situated in\r\nthe centre of the North Pacific, being 2,350 miles from the nearest part of\r\nthe American coast--the bay of San Francisco, and about the same distance\r\nfrom the Marquesas and the Samoa Islands to the south, and the Aleutian\r\nIslands a little west of north. They are, therefore, wonderfully isolated\r\nin mid-ocean, and are only connected with the other Pacific Islands by\r\nwidely scattered coral reefs and atolls, the nearest of which, however, are\r\nsix or seven hundred miles distant, and are all nearly destitute of animal\r\nor vegetable life. The group consists of seven large inhabited islands\r\nbesides four rocky islets; the largest, Hawaii, being seventy miles across\r\nand having an area 3,800 square miles--being somewhat larger than all the\r\nother islands together. A better conception of this large island will be\r\nformed by comparing it with Devonshire, with which it closely agrees both\r\nin size and shape, though its enormous volcanic mountains rise to nearly\r\n14,000 feet high. {311} Three of the smaller islands are each about the\r\nsize of Hertfordshire or Bedfordshire, and the whole group stretches from\r\nnorth-west to south-east for a distance of about 350 miles. Though so\r\nextensive, the entire archipelago is volcanic, and the largest island is\r\nrendered sterile and comparatively uninhabitable by its three active\r\nvolcanoes and their widespread deposits of lava.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP OF THE SANDWICH ISLANDS.]\r\n\r\n  The light tint shows where the sea is less than 1,000 fathoms deep.\r\n  The figures show the depth in fathoms.\r\n\r\nThe ocean depths by which these islands are separated from the nearest\r\ncontinents are enormous. North, east, and south, soundings have been\r\nobtained a little over or under three thousand fathoms, and these profound\r\ndeeps extend over a large part of the North Pacific. We may {312} be quite\r\nsure, therefore, that the Sandwich Islands have, during their whole\r\nexistence, been as completely severed from the great continents as they are\r\nnow; but on the west and south there is a possibility of more extensive\r\nislands having existed, serving as stepping-stones to the island groups of\r\nthe Mid-Pacific. This is indicated by a few widely-scattered coral islets,\r\naround which extend {313} considerable areas of less depth, varying from\r\ntwo hundred to a thousand fathoms, and which _may_ therefore indicate the\r\nsites of submerged islands of considerable extent. When we consider that\r\neast of New Zealand and New Caledonia, all the larger and loftier islands\r\nare of volcanic origin, with no trace of any ancient stratified rocks\r\n(except, perhaps, in the Marquesas, where, according to Jules Marcou,\r\ngranite and gneiss are said to occur) it seems probable that the\r\ninnumerable coral-reefs and atolls, which occur in groups on deeply\r\nsubmerged banks, mark the sites of bygone volcanic islands, similar to\r\nthose which now exist, but which, after becoming extinct, have been lowered\r\nor destroyed by denudation, and finally have altogether disappeared except\r\nwhere their sites are indicated by the upward-growing coral-reefs. If this\r\nview is correct we should give up all idea of there ever having been a\r\nPacific continent, but should look upon that vast ocean as having from the\r\nremotest geological epochs been the seat of volcanic forces, which from its\r\nprofound depths have gradually built up the islands which now dot its\r\nsurface, as well as many others which have sunk beneath its waves. The\r\nnumber of islands, as well as the total quantity of land-surface, may\r\nsometimes have been greater than it is now, and may thus have facilitated\r\nthe transfer of organisms from one group to another, and more rarely even\r\nfrom the American, Asiatic, or Australian continents. Keeping these various\r\nfacts and considerations in view, we may now proceed to examine the fauna\r\nand flora of the Sandwich Islands, and discuss the special phenomena they\r\npresent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP OF THE NORTH PACIFIC WITH ITS SUBMERGED BANKS.]\r\n\r\n  The light tint shows where the sea is less than 1,000 fathoms deep.\r\n  The dark tint    ,,    ,,      ,,    more than 1,000 fathoms deep.\r\n  The figures show the depths in fathoms.\r\n\r\n_Zoology of the Sandwich Islands: Birds._--It need hardly be said that\r\nindigenous mammalia are quite unknown in the Sandwich Islands, the most\r\ninteresting of the higher animals being the birds, which are tolerably\r\nnumerous and highly peculiar. Many aquatic and wading birds which range\r\nover the whole Pacific visit these islands, twenty-five species having been\r\nobserved, but even of these six are peculiar--a coot, _Fulica alai_; a\r\nmoorhen, _Gallinula galeata_ var _sandvichensis_; a rail with rudimentary\r\nwings, _Pennula millei_; a stilt-plover, _Himantopus knudseni_; and {314}\r\ntwo ducks, _Anas Wyvilliana_ and _Bernicla sandvichensis_. The birds of\r\nprey are also great wanderers. Four have been found in the islands--the\r\nshort-eared owl, _Otus brachyotus_, which ranges over the greater part of\r\nthe globe, but is here said to resemble the variety found in Chile and the\r\nGalapagos; the barn owl, _Strix flammea_, of a variety common in the\r\nPacific; a peculiar sparrow-hawk, _Accipiter hawaii_; and _Buteo\r\nsolitarius_, a buzzard of a peculiar species, and coloured so as to\r\nresemble a hawk of the American subfamily Polyborinae. It is to be noted\r\nthat the genus Buteo abounds in America, but is not found in the Pacific;\r\nand this fact, combined with the remarkable colouration, renders it almost\r\ncertain that this peculiar species is of American origin.\r\n\r\nThe Passeres, or true perching birds, are especially interesting, being all\r\nof peculiar species, and, all but one, belonging to peculiar genera. Their\r\nnumbers have been greatly increased since the first edition of this work\r\nappeared, partly by the exertions of American naturalists, and very largely\r\nby the researches of Mr. Scott B. Wilson, who visited the Sandwich Islands\r\nfor the purpose of investigating their ornithology, and collected\r\nassiduously in the various islands of the group for a year and a half. This\r\ngentleman is now publishing a finely illustrated work on Hawaiian birds,\r\nand he has kindly furnished me with the following list.\r\n\r\n  PASSERES OF THE SANDWICH ISLANDS.\r\n\r\n  MUSCICAPIDAE (Flycatchers).\r\n\r\n  1.  _Chasiempis ridgwayi_                Hawaii.\r\n  2.      ,,     _sclateri_                Kauai.\r\n  3.      ,,     _dolei_                   Kauai.\r\n  4.      ,,     _gayi_                    Oahu.\r\n  5.      ,,     _ibidis_                  Oahu.\r\n  6.  _Phaeornis obscura_                  Hawaii.\r\n  7.     ,,    _myadestina_                Kauai.\r\n\r\n  MELIPHAGIDAE (Honeysuckers).\r\n\r\n  8.  _Acrulocercus nobilis_               Hawaii.\r\n  9.        ,,     _braccalus_             Kauai.\r\n  10.       ,,     _apicalis_ (extinct)    Oahu or Maui.\r\n  11. _Chaetoptila angustipluma_ (extinct) Hawaii.\r\n  {315}\r\n\r\n  DREPANIDIDAE.\r\n\r\n  12. _Drepanis pacifica_ (extinct)        Hawaii.\r\n  13. _Vastiaria coccinea_                 All the Islands.\r\n  14. _Hiniatione vireus_                  Hawaii.\r\n  15.      ,,    _dolii_                   Maui.\r\n  16.      ,,    _sanguinea_               All the Islands.\r\n  17.      ,,    _montana_                 Lanai.\r\n  18.      ,,    _chloris_                 Oahu.\r\n  19.      ,,    _maculata_                Oahu.\r\n  20.      ,,    _parva_                   Kauai.\r\n  21.      ,,    _stejnegeri_              Kauai.\r\n  22. _Oreomyza bairdi_                    Kauai.\r\n  23. _Hemignathus obscurus_               Hawaii.\r\n  24.      ,,     _olivaceus_              Hawaii.\r\n  25.      ,,     _lichtensteini_          Oahu.\r\n  26.      ,,     _lucidus_                Oahu.\r\n  27.      ,,     _stejnegeri_             Kauai.\r\n  28.      ,,     _hanapepe_               Kauai.\r\n  29. _Loxops coccinea_                    Hawaii.\r\n  30.    ,,  _flammea_                     Molokai.\r\n  31.    ,,  _aurea_                       Maui.\r\n  32. _Chrysomitridops coeruleorostris_    Kaui.\r\n  33.         ,,      _anna_ (extinct)\r\n\r\n  FRINGILLIDAE (Finches).\r\n\r\n  34. _Loxioides bailleni_                 Hawaii.\r\n  35. _Psittirostra psittacea_             All the Islands.\r\n  36. _Chloridops kona_                    Hawaii.\r\n\r\n  CORVIDAE (Crows).\r\n\r\n  37. _Corvus hawaiiensis_                 Hawaii.\r\n\r\nMany of the birds recently described are representative forms found in the\r\nseveral islands of the group.\r\n\r\nTaking the above in the order here given, we have, first, two peculiar\r\ngenera of true flycatchers, a family confined to the Old World, but\r\nextending over the Pacific as far as the Marquesas Islands. Next we have\r\ntwo peculiar genera (with four species) of honeysuckers, a family confined\r\nto the Australian region, and also ranging over all the Pacific Islands to\r\nthe Marquesas. We now come to the most important group of birds in the\r\nSandwich Islands, comprising seven or eight peculiar genera, and twenty-two\r\nspecies which are believed to form a peculiar family allied to the Oriental\r\nflower-peckers (Diceidae), and perhaps remotely to the American greenlets\r\n(Vireonidae), or {316} tanagers (Tanagridae). They possess singularly\r\nvaried beaks, some having this organ much thickened like those of finches,\r\nto which family some of them have been supposed to belong. In any case they\r\nform a most peculiar group, and cannot be associated with any other known\r\nbirds. The last species, and the only one not belonging to a peculiar\r\ngenus, is the Hawaiian crow, belonging to the almost universally\r\ndistributed genus Corvus.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, the affinities of these birds are, as might be expected,\r\nchiefly with Australia and the Pacific Islands; but they exhibit in the\r\nbuzzard, one of the owls, and perhaps in some of the Drepanididae, slight\r\nindications of very rare or very remote communication with America. The\r\namount of speciality is, however, wonderful, far exceeding that of any\r\nother islands; the only approach to it being made by New Zealand and\r\nMadagascar, which have a much more varied bird fauna and a smaller\r\n_proportionate_ number of peculiar genera. The Galapagos, among the true\r\noceanic islands, while presenting many peculiarities have only four out of\r\nthe ten genera of Passeres peculiar. These facts undoubtedly indicate an\r\nimmense antiquity for this group of islands, or the vicinity of some very\r\nancient land (now submerged), from which some portion of their peculiar\r\nfauna might be derived. For further details as to the affinities and\r\ngeographical distribution of the genera and species, the reader must\r\nconsult Mr. Scott Wilson's work _The Birds of the Sandwich Islands_,\r\nalready alluded to.\r\n\r\n_Reptiles._--The only other vertebrate animals are two lizards. One of\r\nthese is a very widespread species, _Ablepharus poecilopleurus_, ranging\r\nfrom the Pacific Islands to West Africa. The other is said to form a\r\npeculiar genus of geckoes, but both its locality and affinities appear to\r\nbe somewhat doubtful.\r\n\r\n_Land-shells._--The only other group of animals which has been carefully\r\nstudied, and which presents features of especial interest, are the\r\nland-shells. These are very numerous, about thirty genera, and between\r\nthree and four hundred species having been described; and it is remarkable\r\nthat this single group contains as many species of {317} land-shells as all\r\nthe other Polynesian Islands from the Pelew Islands and Samoa to the\r\nMarquesas. All the species are peculiar, and about three-fourths of the\r\nwhole belong to peculiar genera, fourteen of which constitute the subfamily\r\nAchatinellinae, entirely confined to this group of islands and constituting\r\nits most distinguishing feature. Thirteen genera (comprising sixty-four\r\nspecies) are found also in the other Polynesian Islands, but three genera\r\nof Auriculidae (Plecotrema, Pedipes, and Blauneria) are not found in the\r\nPacific, but inhabit--the former genus Australia, China, Bourbon, and Cuba,\r\nthe two latter the West Indian Islands. Another remarkable peculiarity of\r\nthese islands is the small number of Operculata, which are represented by\r\nonly one genus and five species, while the other Pacific Islands have\r\ntwenty genera and 115 species, or more than half the number of the\r\nInoperculata. This difference is so remarkable that it is worth stating in\r\na comparative form:--\r\n\r\n                          Inoperculata.  Operculata.  Auriculidae.\r\n  Sandwich Islands           332              5           9\r\n  Rest of Pacific Islands    200            115          16\r\n\r\nWhen we remember that in the West Indian Islands the Operculata abound in a\r\ngreater proportion than even in the Pacific Islands generally, we are led\r\nto the conclusion that limestone, which is plentiful in both these areas,\r\nis especially favourable to them, while the purely volcanic rocks are\r\nespecially unfavourable. The other peculiarities of the Sandwich Islands,\r\nhowever, such as the enormous preponderance of the strictly endemic\r\nAchatinellinae, and the presence of genera which occur elsewhere only\r\nbeyond the Pacific area in various parts of the great continents,\r\nundoubtedly point to a very remote origin, at a time when the distribution\r\nof many of the groups of mollusca was very different from that which now\r\nprevails.\r\n\r\nA very interesting feature of the Sandwich group is the extent to which the\r\nspecies and even the genera are confined to separate islands. Thus the\r\ngenera Carelia and Catinella with eight species are peculiar to the island\r\nof Kaui; Bulimella, Apex, Frickella, and Blauneria, to Oahu; Perdicella to\r\nMaui; and Eburnella to Lanai. {318} The Rev. John T. Gulick, who has made a\r\nspecial study of the Achatinellinae, informs us that the average range of\r\nthe species in this sub-family is five or six miles, while some are\r\nrestricted to but one or two square miles, and only very few have the range\r\nof a whole island. Each valley, and often each side of a valley, and\r\nsometimes even every ridge and peak possesses its peculiar species.[73] The\r\nisland of Oahu, in which the capital is situated, has furnished about half\r\nthe species already known. This is partly due to its being more\r\nforest-clad, but also, no doubt, in part to its being better explored, so\r\nthat notwithstanding the exceptional riches of the group, we have no reason\r\nto suppose that there are not many more species to be found in the less\r\nexplored islands. Mr. Gulick tells us that the forest region that covers\r\none of the mountain ranges of Oahu is about forty miles in length, and five\r\nor six miles in width, yet this small territory furnishes about 175 species\r\nof Achatinellidae, represented by 700 or 800 varieties. The most important\r\npeculiar genus, not belonging to the Achatinella group, is Carelia, with\r\nsix species and several named varieties, all peculiar to Kaui, the most\r\nwesterly of the large islands. This would seem to show that the small\r\nislets stretching westward, and situated on an extensive bank with less\r\nthan a thousand fathoms of water over it, may indicate the position of a\r\nlarge submerged island whence some portion of the Sandwich Island fauna was\r\nderived.\r\n\r\n_Insects._--Owing to the researches of the Rev. T. Blackburn we have now a\r\nfair knowledge of the Coleopterous fauna of these islands. Unfortunately\r\nsome of the most productive islands in plants--Kaui and Maui--were very\r\nlittle explored, but during a residence of six years the equally rich Oahu\r\nwas well worked, and the general character of the beetle fauna must\r\ntherefore be considered to be pretty accurately determined. Out of 428\r\nspecies collected, many being obviously recent introductions, no {319} less\r\nthan 352 species and 99 of the genera appear to be quite peculiar to the\r\narchipelago. Sixty of these species are Carabidae, forty-two are\r\nStaphylinidae, forty are Nitidulidae, twenty are Ptinidae, twenty are\r\nCiodidae, thirty are Aglycyderidae, forty-five are Curculionidae, and\r\nfourteen are Cerambycidae, the remainder being distributed among twenty-two\r\nother families. Many important families, such as Cicindelidae,\r\nScaraboeidae, Buprestidae, and the whole of the enormous series of the\r\nPhytophaga are either entirely absent or are only represented by a few\r\nintroduced species. In the eight families enumerated above most of the\r\nspecies belong to peculiar genera which usually contain numerous distinct\r\nspecies; and we may therefore consider these to represent the descendants\r\nof the most ancient immigrants into the islands.\r\n\r\nTwo important characteristics of the Coleopterous fauna are, the small size\r\nof the species, and the great scarcity of individuals. Dr. Sharp, who has\r\ndescribed many of them,[74] says they are \"mostly small or very minute\r\ninsects,\" and that \"there are few--probably it would be correct to say\r\nabsolutely none--that would strike an ordinary observer as being\r\nbeautiful.\" Mr. Blackburn says that it was not an uncommon thing for him to\r\npass a morning on the mountains and to return home with perhaps two or\r\nthree specimens, having seen literally nothing else except the few species\r\nthat are generally abundant. He states that he \"has frequently spent an\r\nhour sweeping flower-covered herbage, or beating branches of trees over an\r\ninverted white umbrella without seeing the sign of a beetle of any kind.\"\r\nTo those who have collected in any tropical or even temperate country on or\r\nnear a continent, this poverty of insect life must seem almost incredible;\r\nand it affords us a striking proof of how erroneous are those now almost\r\nobsolete views which imputed the abundance, variety, size, and colour of\r\ninsects to the warmth and sunlight and luxuriant vegetation of the tropics.\r\nThe facts become quite intelligible, however, if we consider that only\r\n{320} minute insects of certain groups could ever reach the islands by\r\nnatural means, and that these, already highly specialised for certain\r\ndefined modes of life, could only develop slowly into slightly modified\r\nforms of the original types. Some of the groups, however, are considered by\r\nDr. Sharp to be very ancient generalised forms, especially the peculiar\r\nfamily Aglycyderidae, which he looks upon as being \"absolutely the most\r\nprimitive of all the known forms of Coleoptera, it being a synthetic form\r\nlinking the isolated Rhynchophagous series of families with the Clavicorn\r\nseries. About thirty species are known in the Hawaiian Islands, and they\r\nexhibit much difference _inter se_.\" A few remarks on each of the more\r\nimportant of the families will serve to indicate their probable mode and\r\nperiod of introduction into the islands.\r\n\r\nThe Carabidae consist chiefly of seven peculiar genera of Anchomenini\r\ncomprising fifty-one species, and several endemic species of Bembidiinae.\r\nThey are highly peculiar and are all of small size, and may have originally\r\nreached the islands in the crevices of the drift wood from N.W. America\r\nwhich is still thrown on their shores, or, more rarely, by means of a\r\nsimilar drift from the N.-Western islands of the Pacific.[75] It is\r\ninteresting to note that peculiar species of the same groups of Carabidae\r\nare found in the Azores, Canaries, and St. Helena, indicating that they\r\npossess some special facilities for transmission across wide oceans and for\r\nestablishing themselves upon oceanic islands. The Staphylinidae present\r\nmany peculiar species of known genera. Being still more minute and usually\r\nmore ubiquitous than the Carabidae, there is no difficulty in accounting\r\nfor their presence in the islands by the same means of dispersal. The\r\nNitidulidae, Ptinidae, and Ciodidae being very small and of varied habits,\r\neither the perfect insects, their eggs or larvae, may have been introduced\r\neither by water or wind carriage, or through the agency of birds. The\r\nCurculionidae, being wood bark or nut borers, would have considerable\r\nfacilities for transmission by floating timber, fruits, or nuts; and the\r\neggs or larvae of the {321} peculiar Cerambycidae must have been introduced\r\nby the same means. The absence of so many important and cosmopolitan groups\r\nwhose size or constitution render them incapable of being thus transmitted\r\nover the sea, as well as of many which seem equally well adapted as those\r\nwhich are found in the islands, indicate how rare have been the conditions\r\nfor successful immigration; and this is still further emphasized by the\r\nextreme specialisation of the fauna, indicating that there has been no\r\nrepeated immigration of the same species which would tend, as in the case\r\nof Bermuda, to preserve the originally introduced forms unchanged by the\r\neffects of repeated intercrossing.\r\n\r\n_Vegetation of the Sandwich Islands._--The flora of these islands is in\r\nmany respects so peculiar and remarkable, and so well supplements the\r\ninformation derived from its interesting but scanty fauna, that a brief\r\naccount of its more striking features will not be out of place; and we\r\nfortunately have a pretty full knowledge of it, owing to the researches of\r\nthe German botanist Dr. W. Hildebrand.[76]\r\n\r\nConsidering their extreme isolation, their uniform volcanic soil, and the\r\nlarge proportion of the chief island which consists of barren lava-fields,\r\nthe flora of the Sandwich Islands is extremely rich, consisting, so far as\r\nat present known, of 844 species of flowering plants and 155 ferns. This is\r\nconsiderably richer than the Azores (439 Phanerogams and 39 ferns), which\r\nthough less extensive are perhaps better known, or than the Galapagos (332\r\nPhanerogams), which are more strictly comparable, being equally volcanic,\r\nwhile their somewhat smaller area may perhaps be compensated by their\r\nproximity to the American continent. Even New Zealand with more than twenty\r\ntimes the area of the Sandwich group, whose soil and climate are much more\r\nvaried and whose botany has been thoroughly explored, has not a very much\r\nlarger number of flowering plants (935 species), while in ferns it is\r\nbarely equal.\r\n\r\n{322}\r\n\r\nThe following list gives the number of indigenous species in each natural\r\norder.\r\n\r\n_Number of Species in each Natural Order in the Hawaiian Flora, excluding\r\nthe introduced Plants._\r\n\r\n  DICOTYLEDONS.                       48.

There are\r\nno less than 38 peculiar genera out of a total of 265 and these 38 genera\r\ncomprise 254 species, so that the most isolated forms are those which most\r\nabound and thus give a special character to the flora. Besides these\r\npeculiar types, several genera of wide range are here represented by highly\r\npeculiar species. Such are the Hawaiian species of Lobelia which are woody\r\nshrubs either creeping or six feet high, while a species of one of the\r\npeculiar genera of Lobeliaceae is a tree reaching a height of forty feet.\r\nShrubby geraniums grow twelve or fifteen feet high, and some vacciniums\r\ngrow as epiphytes on the trunks of trees. Violets and plantains also form\r\ntall shrubby plants, and there are many strange arborescent compositae, as\r\nin other oceanic islands.\r\n\r\nThe affinities of the flora generally are very wide. Although there are\r\nmany Polynesian groups, yet Australian, New Zealand, and American forms are\r\nequally represented. Dr. Pickering notes the total absence of a large\r\nnumber of families found in Southern Polynesia, such as Dilleniceaea,\r\nAnonaceae, Olacaceae, Aurantiaceae, Guttiferae, Malpighiaceae, Meliaceae,\r\nCombretaceae, Rhizophoraceae, Melastomaceae, Passifloraceae, Cunoniaceae,\r\nJasminaceae, Acanthaceae, Myristicaceae, and Casuaraceae, as well as the\r\ngenera Clerodendron, Ficus, and epidendric orchids. Australian affinities\r\nare shown by the genera Exocarpus, Cyathodes, Melicope, Pittosporum, and by\r\na phyllodinous Acacia. New Zealand is represented by Ascarina, Coprosma,\r\nAcaena, and several Cyperaceae; while America is represented by the genera\r\nNama, Gunnera, Phyllostegia, Sisyrinchium, and by a red-flowered Rubus and\r\na yellow-flowered Sanicula allied to Oregon species.\r\n\r\nThere is no true alpine flora on the higher summits, but several of the\r\ntemperate forms extend to a great elevation. Thus Mr. Pickering records\r\nVaccinium, Ranunculus, Silene, Gnaphalium and Geranium, as occurring above\r\nten {324} thousand feet elevation; while Viola, Drosera, Acaena, Lobelia,\r\nEdwardsia, Dodonaea, Lycopodium, and many Compositae, range above six\r\nthousand feet. Vaccinium and Silene are very interesting, as they are\r\nalmost peculiar to the North Temperate zone; while many plants allied to\r\nAntarctic species are found in the bogs of the high plateaux.\r\n\r\nThe proportionate abundance of the different families in this interesting\r\nflora is as follows:--\r\n\r\n   1. Compositae        70 species,   12. Urticaceae        15 species,\r\n   2. Lobeliaceae       58   ,,       13. Malvaceae         14   ,,\r\n   3. Graminaceae       57   ,,       14. Convolvulaceae    14   ,,\r\n   4. Rubiaceae         49   ,,       15. Araliaceae        12   ,,\r\n   5. Cyperaceae        47   ,,       16. Solanaceae        12   ,,\r\n   6. Labiatae          39   ,,       17. Euphorbiaceae     12   ,,\r\n   7. Rutaceae          30   ,,       18. Pittosporaceae    10   ,,\r\n   8. Gesneriaceae      24   ,,       19. Amarantaceae       9   ,,\r\n   9. Caryophyllaceae   23   ,,       20. Violaceae          8   ,,\r\n  10. Leguminosae       21   ,,       21. Goodeniaceae       8   ,,\r\n  11. Piperaceae        20   ,,\r\n\r\nNine other orders, Geraniaceae, Rhamnaceae, Rosaceae, Myrtaceae,\r\nPrimulaceae, Loganiaceae, Liliaceae, Thymelaceae, and Cucurbitaceae, have\r\nsix or seven species each; and among the more important orders which have\r\nless than five species each are Ranunculaceae, Cruciferae, Vaccinacae,\r\nApocynaceae, Boraginaceae, Scrophulariaceae, Polygonaceae, Orchidaceae, and\r\nJuncaceae. The most remarkable feature here is the great abundance of\r\nLobeliaceae, a character of the flora which is probably unique; while the\r\nsuperiority of Labiatae to Leguminosae and the scarcity of Rosaceae and\r\nOrchidaceae are also very unusual. Composites, as in most temperate floras,\r\nstand at the head of the list, and it will be interesting to note the\r\naffinities which they indicate. Omitting eleven species which are\r\ncosmopolitan, and have no doubt entered with civilised man, there remain\r\nnineteen genera and seventy species of Compositae in the islands. Sixty-one\r\nof the species are peculiar, as are eight of the genera; while the genus\r\nLipochaeta with eleven species is only known elsewhere in the Galapagos,\r\nwhere a single species occurs. We may therefore consider that nine out of\r\nthe nineteen genera of Hawaiian {325} Compositae are really confined to the\r\nArchipelago. The relations of the peculiar genera and species are indicated\r\nin the following table.[77]\r\n\r\n_Affinities of Hawaiian Composites._\r\n\r\n                   No. of\r\n  Peculiar Genera.

It is\r\nhere that we meet with some of the most isolated and remarkable forms,\r\nimplying great antiquity; and when we consider the enormous extent and\r\nworld-wide distribution of this order (comprising about ten thousand\r\nspecies), its distinctness from all others, the great specialisation of its\r\nflowers to attract insects, and of its seeds for dispersal by wind and\r\nother means, we can hardly doubt that its origin dates back to a very\r\nremote epoch. We may therefore look upon the Compositae as representing the\r\nmost ancient portion of the existing flora of the Sandwich Islands,\r\ncarrying us back to a very remote period when the facilities for\r\ncommunication with America were greater than they are now. This may be\r\nindicated by the two deep submarine banks in the North Pacific, between the\r\nSandwich Islands and San Francisco, which, from an ocean floor {326} nearly\r\n3,000 fathoms deep, rise up to within a few hundred fathoms of the surface,\r\nand seem to indicate the subsidence of two islands, each about as large as\r\nHawaii. The plants of North Temperate affinity may be nearly as old, but\r\nthese may have been derived from Northern Asia by way of Japan and the\r\nextensive line of shoals which run north-westward from the Sandwich\r\nIslands, as shown on our map. Those which exhibit Polynesian or Australian\r\naffinities, consisting for the most part of less highly modified species,\r\nusually of the same genera, may have had their origin at a later, though\r\nstill somewhat remote period, when large islands, indicated by the\r\nextensive shoals to the south and south-west, offered facilities for the\r\ntransmission of plants from the tropical portions of the Pacific Ocean.\r\n\r\nIt is in the smaller and most woody islands in the westerly portion of the\r\ngroup, especially in Kauai and Oahu, that the greatest number and variety\r\nof plants are found and the largest proportion of peculiar species and\r\ngenera. These are believed to form the oldest portion of the group, the\r\nvolcanic activity having ceased and allowed a luxuriant vegetation more\r\ncompletely to cover the islands, while in the larger and much newer islands\r\nof Hawaii and Maui the surface is more barren and the vegetation\r\ncomparatively monotonous. Thus while twelve of the arborescent Lobeliaceae\r\nhave been found on Hawaii no less than seventeen occur on the much smaller\r\nOahu, which has even a genus of these plants confined to it.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that while the non-peculiar genera of flowering\r\nplants have little more than two species to a genus, the endemic genera\r\naverage six and three-quarter species to a genus. These may be considered\r\nto represent the earliest immigrants which became firmly established in the\r\ncomparatively unoccupied islands, and have gradually become modified into\r\nsuch complete harmony with their new conditions that they have developed\r\ninto many diverging forms adapting them to different _habitats_.

In the former case the facilities for\r\nwind-dispersal afforded by the structure of so many of the seeds render it\r\ncomparatively easy to account for their having reached the islands at an\r\nearly period. The Lobelias, judging from Hildebrand's descriptions, may\r\nhave been transported in several {328} different ways. Most of the endemic\r\ngenera are berry-bearers and thus offer the means of dispersal by\r\nfruit-eating birds. The endemic species of the genus Lobelia have sometimes\r\nvery minute seeds, which might be carried long distances by wind, while\r\nother species, especially Lobelia gaudichaudii, have a \"hard, almost woody\r\ncapsule which opens late,\" apparently well adapted for floating long\r\ndistances. Afterwards \"the calycine covering withers away, leaving a\r\nfenestrate woody network\" enclosing the capsule, and the seeds themselves\r\nare \"compressed, reniform, or orbicular, and margined,\" and thus of a form\r\nwell adapted to be carried to great heights and distances by gales or\r\nhurricanes.\r\n\r\nIn the other orders which present several endemic genera indications of the\r\nmode of transit to the islands are afforded us. The Araliaceae are said to\r\nhave fleshy fruits or drupes more or less succulent. The Rubiaceae have\r\nusually berries or drupes, while one genus, Kadua, has \"small, flat, winged\r\nseeds.\" The two largest genera of the Labiatae are said to have \"fleshy\r\nnucules,\" which would no doubt be swallowed by birds.[78]\r\n\r\n_Antiquity of the Hawaiian Fauna and Flora._--The great antiquity implied\r\nby the peculiarities of the fauna and flora, no less than by the\r\ngeographical conditions and surroundings, of this group, will enable us to\r\naccount for another peculiarity of its flora--the absence of so many\r\nfamilies found in other Pacific Islands. For the earliest immigrants would\r\nsoon occupy much of the surface, and become specially modified in\r\naccordance with the conditions of the locality, and these would serve as a\r\nbarrier against the intrusion of many forms which at a later {329} period\r\nspread over Polynesia. The extreme remoteness of the islands, and the\r\nprobability that they have always been more isolated than those of the\r\nCentral Pacific, would also necessarily result in an imperfect and\r\nfragmentary representation of the flora of surrounding lands.\r\n\r\n_Concluding Observations on the Fauna and Flora of the Sandwich\r\nIslands._--The indications thus afforded by a study of the flora seem to\r\naccord well with what we know of the fauna of the islands. Plants having so\r\nmuch greater facilities for dispersal than animals, and also having greater\r\nspecific longevity and greater powers of endurance under adverse\r\nconditions, exhibit in a considerable degree the influence of the primitive\r\nstate of the islands and their surroundings; while members of the animal\r\nworld, passing across the sea with greater difficulty and subject to\r\nextermination by a variety of adverse conditions, retain much more of the\r\nimpress of a recent state of things, with perhaps here and there an\r\nindication of that ancient approach to America so clearly shown in the\r\nCompositae and some other portions of the flora.\r\n\r\nGENERAL REMARKS ON OCEANIC ISLANDS.\r\n\r\nWe have now reviewed the main features presented by the assemblages of\r\norganic forms which characterise the more important and best known of the\r\nOceanic Islands. They all agree in the total absence of indigenous mammalia\r\nand amphibia, while their reptiles, when they possess any, do not exhibit\r\nindications of extreme isolation and antiquity. Their birds and insects\r\npresent just that amount of specialisation and diversity from continental\r\nforms which may be well explained by the known means of dispersal acting\r\nthrough long periods; their land shells indicate greater isolation, owing\r\nto their admittedly less effective means of conveyance across the ocean;\r\nwhile their plants show most clearly the effects of those changes of\r\nconditions which we have reason to believe have occurred during the\r\nTertiary epoch, and preserve to us in highly specialised and archaic forms\r\nsome record of the primeval immigration by which the islands were\r\noriginally {330} clothed with vegetation. But in every case the series of\r\nforms of life in these islands is scanty and imperfect as compared with far\r\nless favourable continental areas, and no one of them presents such an\r\nassemblage of animals or plants as we always find in an island which we\r\nknow has once formed part of a continent.\r\n\r\nIt is still more important to note that none of these oceanic archipelagoes\r\npresent us with a single type which we may suppose to have been preserved\r\nfrom Mesozoic times; and this fact, taken in connection with the volcanic\r\nor coralline origin of all of them, powerfully enforces the conclusion at\r\nwhich we have arrived in the earlier portion of this volume, that during\r\nthe whole period of geologic time as indicated by the fossiliferous rocks,\r\nour continents and oceans have, speaking broadly, been permanent features\r\nof our earth's surface. For had it been otherwise--had sea and land changed\r\nplace repeatedly as was once supposed--had our deepest oceans been the seat\r\nof great continents while the site of our present continents was occupied\r\nby an oceanic abyss--is it possible to imagine that no fragments of such\r\ncontinents would remain in the present oceans, bringing down to us some of\r\ntheir ancient forms of life preserved with but little change? The\r\ncorrelative facts, that the islands of our great oceans are all volcanic\r\n(or coralline built probably upon degraded volcanic islands or extinct\r\nsubmarine volcanoes), and that their productions are all more or less\r\nclearly related to the existing inhabitants of the nearest continents, are\r\nhardly consistent with any other theory than the permanence of our oceanic\r\nand continental areas.\r\n\r\nWe may here refer to the one apparent exception, which, however, lends\r\nadditional force to the argument. New Zealand is sometimes classed as an\r\noceanic island, but it is not so really; and we shall discuss its\r\npeculiarities and probable origin further on.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{331}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nCONTINENTAL ISLANDS OF RECENT ORIGIN: GREAT BRITAIN\r\n\r\n    Characteristic Features of Recent Continental Islands--Recent Physical\r\n    Changes of the British Isles--Proofs of Former Elevation--Submerged\r\n    Forests--Buried River Channels--Time of Last Union with the\r\n    Continent--Why Britain is poor in Species--Peculiar British\r\n    Birds--Freshwater Fishes--Cause of Great Speciality in Fishes--Peculiar\r\n    British Insects--Lepidoptera Confined to the British\r\n    Isles--Peculiarities of the Isle of Man--Lepidoptera--Coleoptera\r\n    confined to the British Isles--Trichoptera Peculiar to the British\r\n    Isles--Land and Freshwater Shells--Peculiarities of the British\r\n    Flora--Peculiarities of the Irish Flora--Peculiar British Mosses and\r\n    Hepaticae--Concluding Remarks on the Peculiarities of the British Fauna\r\n    and Flora.\r\n\r\nWe now proceed to examine those islands which are the very reverse of the\r\n\"oceanic\" class, being fragments of continents or of larger islands from\r\nwhich they have been separated, by subsidence of the intervening land at a\r\nperiod which, geologically, must be considered recent. Such islands are\r\nalways still connected with their parent land by a shallow sea, usually\r\nindeed not exceeding a hundred fathoms deep; they always possess mammalia\r\nand reptiles either wholly or in large proportion identical with those of\r\nthe mainland; while their entire flora and fauna is characterised either by\r\nthe total absence or comparative scarcity of those endemic or peculiar\r\nspecies and genera which are so striking a feature of almost all oceanic\r\nislands. Such islands will, of course, differ from each {332} other in\r\nsize, in antiquity, and in the richness of their respective faunas, as well\r\nas in their distance from the parent land and the facilities for\r\nintercommunication with it; and these diversities of conditions will\r\nmanifest themselves in the greater or less amount of speciality of their\r\nanimal productions.\r\n\r\nThis speciality, when it exists, may have been brought about in two ways. A\r\nspecies or even a genus may on a continent have had a very limited area of\r\ndistribution, and this area may be wholly or almost wholly contained in the\r\nseparated portion or island, to which it will henceforth be peculiar. Even\r\nwhen the area occupied by a species is pretty equally divided at the time\r\nof separation between the island and the continent, it may happen that it\r\nwill become extinct on the latter, while it may survive on the former,\r\nbecause the limited number of individuals after division may be unable to\r\nmaintain themselves against the severer competition or more contrasted\r\nclimate of the continent, while they may flourish, under the more\r\nfavourable insular conditions. On the other hand, when a species continues\r\nto exist in both areas, it may on the island be subjected to some\r\nmodifications by the altered conditions, and may thus come to present\r\ncharacters which differentiate it from its continental allies and\r\nconstitute it a new species. We shall in the course of our survey meet with\r\ncases illustrative of both these processes.\r\n\r\nThe best examples of recent continental islands are Great Britain and\r\nIreland, Japan, Formosa, and the larger Malay Islands, especially Borneo,\r\nJava, and Celebes; and as each of these presents special features of\r\ninterest, we will give a short outline of their zoology and past history in\r\nrelation to that of the continents from which they have recently been\r\nseparated, commencing with our own islands, to which the present chapter\r\nwill be devoted.\r\n\r\n_Recent Physical Changes in the British Isles._--Great Britain is perhaps\r\nthe most typical example of a large and recent continental island now to be\r\nfound upon the globe. It is joined to the Continent by a shallow bank which\r\nextends from Denmark to the Bay of Biscay, the 100 fathom line from these\r\nextreme points receding from the {333} coasts so as to include the whole of\r\nthe British Isles and about fifty miles beyond them to the westward. (_See_\r\nMap.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP SHOWING THE SHALLOW BANK CONNECTING THE BRITISH ISLES\r\nWITH THE CONTINENT.]\r\n\r\n  The light tint indicates a depth of less than 100 fathoms.\r\n  The figures show the depth in fathoms.\r\n  The narrow channel between Norway and Denmark is 2,580 feet deep.\r\n\r\nBeyond this line the sea deepens rapidly to the 500 and 1,000 fathom lines,\r\nthe distance between 100 and 1,000 {334} fathoms being from twenty to fifty\r\nmiles, except where there is a great outward curve to include the Porcupine\r\nBank 170 miles west of Galway, and to the north-west of Caithness where a\r\nnarrow ridge less than 500 fathoms below the surface joins the extensive\r\nbank under 300 fathoms, on which are situated the Faroe Islands and\r\nIceland, and which stretches across to Greenland. In the North Channel\r\nbetween Ireland and Scotland, and in the Minch between the outer Hebrides\r\nand Skye, are a series of hollows in the sea-bottom from 100 to 150 fathoms\r\ndeep. These correspond exactly to the points between the opposing highlands\r\nwhere the greatest accumulations of ice would necessarily occur during the\r\nglacial epoch, and they may well be termed submarine lakes, of exactly the\r\nsame nature as those which occur in similar positions on land.\r\n\r\n_Proofs of Former Elevation--Submerged Forests._--What renders Britain\r\nparticularly instructive as an example of a recent continental island is\r\nthe amount of direct evidence that exists, of several distinct kinds,\r\nshowing that the land has been sufficiently elevated (or the sea depressed)\r\nto unite it with the Continent,--and this at a very recent period. The\r\nfirst class of evidence is the existence, all round our coasts, of the\r\nremains of submarine forests often extending far below the present\r\nlow-water mark. Such are the submerged forests near Torquay in Devonshire,\r\nand near Falmouth in Cornwall, both containing stumps of trees in their\r\nnatural position rooted in the soil, with deposits of peat, branches, and\r\nnuts, and often with remains of insects and other land animals. These occur\r\nin very different conditions and situations, and some have been explained\r\nby changes in the height of the tide, or by pebble banks shutting out the\r\ntidal waters from estuaries; but there are numerous examples to which such\r\nhypotheses cannot apply, and which can only be explained by an actual\r\nsubsidence of the land (or rise of the sea-level) since the trees grew.\r\n\r\nWe cannot give a better idea of these forests than by quoting the following\r\naccount by Mr. Pengelly of a visit to one which had been exposed by a\r\nviolent storm on the coast of Devonshire, at Blackpool near Dartmouth:--\r\n{335}\r\n\r\n\"We were so fortunate as to reach the beach at spring-tide low-water, and\r\nto find, admirably exposed, by far the finest example of a submerged forest\r\nwhich I have ever seen. It occupied a rectangular area, extending from the\r\nsmall river or stream at the western end of the inlet, about one furlong\r\neastward; and from the low-water line thirty yards up the strand. The lower\r\nor seaward portion of the forest area, occupying about two-thirds of its\r\nentire breadth, consisted of a brownish drab-coloured clay, which was\r\ncrowded with vegetable _debris_, such as small twigs, leaves, and nuts.\r\nThere were also numerous prostrate trunks and branches of trees, lying\r\npartly imbedded in the clay, without anything like a prevalent direction.\r\nThe trunks varied from six inches to upwards of two feet in diameter. Much\r\nof the wood was found to have a reddish or bright pink hue, when fresh\r\nsurfaces were exposed. Some of it, as well as many of the twigs, had almost\r\nbecome a sort of ligneous pulp, while other examples were firm, and gave a\r\nsharp crackling sound on being broken. Several large stumps projected above\r\nthe clay in a vertical direction, and sent roots and rootlets into the soil\r\nin all directions and to considerable distances. It was obvious that the\r\nmovement by which the submergence was effected had been so uniform as not\r\nto destroy the approximate horizontality of the old forest ground. One fine\r\nexample was noted of a large prostrate trunk having its roots still\r\nattached, some of them sticking up above the clay, while others were buried\r\nin it. Hazelnuts were extremely abundant--some entire, others broken, and\r\nsome obviously gnawed.... It has been stated that the forest area reached\r\nthe spring-tide low-water line; hence as the greatest tidal range on this\r\ncoast amounts to eighteen feet, we are warranted in inferring that the\r\nsubsidence amounted to eighteen feet as a minimum, even if we suppose that\r\nsome of the trees grew in a soil the surface of which was not above the\r\nlevel of high water. There is satisfactory evidence that in Torbay it was\r\nnot less than forty feet, and that in Falmouth Harbour it amounted to at\r\nleast sixty-seven feet.\"[79]\r\n\r\n{336}\r\n\r\nOn the coast of the Bristol Channel similar deposits occur, as well as\r\nalong much of the coast of Wales and in Holyhead Harbour. It is believed by\r\ngeologists that the whole Bristol Channel was, at a comparatively recent\r\nperiod, an extensive plain, through which flowed the River Severn; for in\r\naddition to the evidence of submerged forests there are on the coast of\r\nGlamorganshire numerous caves and fissures in the face of high sea cliffs,\r\nin one of which no less than a thousand antlers of the reindeer were found,\r\nthe remains of animals which had been devoured there by bears and hyaenas;\r\nfacts which can only be explained by the existence of some extent of dry\r\nland stretching seaward from the present cliffs, but since submerged and\r\nwashed away. This plain may have continued down to very recent times, since\r\nthe whole of the Bristol Channel to beyond Lundy Island is under\r\ntwenty-five fathoms deep. In the east of England we have a similar\r\nforest-bed at Cromer in Norfolk; and in the north of Holland an old land\r\nsurface has been found fifty-six feet below high-water mark.\r\n\r\n_Buried River Channels._--Still more remarkable are the buried river\r\nchannels which have been traced on many parts of our coasts. In order to\r\nfacilitate the study of the glacial deposits of Scotland, Dr. James Croll\r\nobtained the details of about 250 bores put down in all parts of the mining\r\ndistricts of Scotland for the purpose of discovering minerals.[80] These\r\nrevealed the interesting fact that there are ancient valleys and river\r\nchannels at depths of from 100 to 260 feet below the present sea-level.\r\nThese old rivers sometimes run in quite different directions from the\r\npresent lines of drainage, connecting what are now distinct valleys; and\r\nthey are so completely filled up and hidden by boulder clay, drift, and\r\nsands, that there is no indication of their presence on the surface, which\r\noften consists of mounds or low hills more than 100 feet high. One of these\r\nold valleys connects the Clyde near Dumbarton with the Forth at\r\nGrangemouth, and appears to have contained two streams flowing in opposite\r\ndirections from a watershed about midway at Kilsith. At {337} Grangemouth\r\nthe old channel is 260 feet below the sea-level. The watershed at Kilsith\r\nis now 160 feet above the sea, the old valley bottom being 120 feet deep or\r\nforty feet above the sea. In some places the old valley was a ravine with\r\nprecipitous rocky walls, which have been found in mining excavations. Sir\r\nA. Geikie, who has himself discovered many similar buried valleys, is of\r\nopinion that \"they unquestionably belong to the period of the boulder\r\nclay.\"\r\n\r\nWe have here a clear proof that, when these rivers were formed, the land\r\nmust have stood in relation to the sea _at least_ 260 feet higher than it\r\ndoes now, and probably much more; and this is sufficient to join England to\r\nthe continent. Supporting this evidence, we have freshwater or littoral\r\nshells found at great depths off our coasts. Mr. Godwin Austen records the\r\ndredging up of a freshwater shell (_Unio pictorum_) off the mouth of the\r\nEnglish Channel between the fifty fathom and 100 fathom lines, while in the\r\nsame locality gravel banks with littoral shells now lie under sixty or\r\nseventy fathoms water.[81] More recently Mr. Gwyn Jeffreys has recorded the\r\ndiscovery of eight species of fossil arctic shells off the Shetland Isles\r\nin about ninety fathoms water, all being characteristic shallow water\r\nspecies, so that their association at this great depth is a distinct\r\nindication of considerable subsidence.[82]\r\n\r\n_Time of Last Union with the Continent._--The period when this last union\r\nwith the continent took place was comparatively recent, as shown by the\r\nidentity of the shells with living species, and the fact that the buried\r\nriver channels are all covered with clays and gravels of the glacial\r\nperiod, of such a character as to indicate that most of them were deposited\r\nabove the sea-level. From these and various other indications geologists\r\nare all agreed that the last continental period, as it is called, was\r\nsubsequent to the greatest development of the ice, but probably before the\r\ncold epoch had wholly passed away. But if so recent, we should naturally\r\nexpect our land still {338} to show an almost perfect community with the\r\nadjacent parts of the continent in its natural productions; and such is\r\nfound to be the case. All the higher and more perfectly organised animals\r\nare, with but few exceptions, identical with those of France and Germany;\r\nwhile the few species still considered to be peculiar may be accounted for\r\neither by an original local distribution, by preservation here owing to\r\nfavourable insular conditions, or by slight modifications having been\r\ncaused by these conditions resulting in a local race, sub-species, or\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\n_Why Britain is Poor in Species._--The former union of our islands with the\r\ncontinent, is not, however, the only recent change they have undergone.\r\nThere have been partial submergences to the depth of from one hundred to\r\nperhaps three hundred feet over a large part of our country; while during\r\nthe period of maximum glaciation the whole area north of the Thames was\r\nburied in snow and ice. Even the south of England must have suffered the\r\nrigour of an almost arctic climate, since Mr. Clement Reid has shown that\r\nfloating ice brought granite blocks from the Channel Islands to the coast\r\nof Sussex. Such conditions must have almost exterminated our preexisting\r\nfauna and flora, and it was only during the subsequent union of Britain\r\nwith the continent that the bulk of existing animals and plants could have\r\nentered our islands. We know that just before and during the glacial period\r\nwe possessed a fauna almost or quite identical with that of adjacent parts\r\nof the continent and equally rich in species. The glaciation and\r\nsubmergence destroyed much of this fauna; and the permanent change of\r\nclimate on the passing away of the glacial conditions appears to have led\r\nto the extinction or migration of many species in the adjacent continental\r\nareas, where they were succeeded by the assemblage of animals now occupying\r\nCentral Europe. When England became continental, these entered our country;\r\nbut sufficient time does not seem to have elapsed for the migration to have\r\nbeen completed before subsidence again occurred, cutting off the further\r\ninflux of purely terrestrial animals, and leaving us without the number of\r\nspecies which our favourable climate and varied surface entitle us to.\r\n{339}\r\n\r\nTo this cause we must impute our comparative poverty in mammalia and\r\nreptiles--more marked in the latter than the former, owing to their lower\r\nvital activity and smaller powers of dispersal. Germany, for example,\r\npossesses nearly ninety species of land mammalia, and even Scandinavia\r\nabout sixty, while Britain has only forty, and Ireland only twenty-two. The\r\ndepth of the Irish Sea being somewhat greater than that of the German\r\nOcean, the connecting land would there probably be of small extent and of\r\nless duration, thus offering an additional barrier to migration, whence has\r\narisen the comparative zoological poverty of Ireland. This poverty attains\r\nits maximum in the reptiles, as shown by the following figures:--\r\n\r\n  Belgium has 22 species of reptiles and amphibia.\r\n  Britain ,,  13   ,,          ,,           ,,\r\n  Ireland ,,   4   ,,          ,,           ,,\r\n\r\nWhere the power of flight existed, and thus the period of migration was\r\nprolonged, the difference is less marked; so that Ireland has seven bats to\r\ntwelve in Britain, and about 110 as against 130 land-birds.\r\n\r\nPlants, which have considerable facilities for passing over the sea, are\r\nsomewhat intermediate in proportionate numbers, there being about 970\r\nflowering plants and ferns in Ireland to 1,425 in Great Britain,--or almost\r\nexactly two-thirds, a proportion intermediate between that presented by the\r\nbirds and the mammalia.\r\n\r\n_Peculiar British Birds._--Among our native mammalia, reptiles, and\r\namphibia, it is the opinion of the best authorities that we possess neither\r\na distinct species nor distinguishable variety. In birds, however, the case\r\nis different, since some of our species, in particular our coal-tit and\r\nlong-tailed tit, present well-marked differences of colour as compared with\r\ncontinental specimens; and in Mr. Dresser's work on the _Birds of Europe_\r\nthey are considered to be distinct species, while Professor Newton, in his\r\nnew edition of Yarrell's _British Birds_, does not consider the difference\r\nto be sufficiently great or sufficiently constant to warrant this, and\r\ntherefore classes {340} them as insular races of the continental species.\r\nWe have, however, one undoubted case of a bird peculiar to the British\r\nIsles, in the red grouse (_Lagopus scoticus_), which abounds in Scotland,\r\nIreland, the north of England, and Wales, and is very distinct from any\r\ncontinental species, although closely allied to the willow grouse of\r\nScandinavia. This latter species resembles it considerably in its summer\r\nplumage, but becomes pure white in winter; whereas our species retains its\r\ndark plumage throughout the year, becoming even darker in winter than in\r\nsummer. We have here therefore a most interesting example of an insular\r\nform in our own country; but it is difficult to determine how it\r\noriginated. On the one hand, it may be an old continental species which\r\nduring the glacial epoch found a refuge here when driven from its native\r\nhaunts by the advancing ice; or, on the other hand, it may be a descendant\r\nof the Northern willow grouse, which has lost its power of turning white in\r\nwinter owing to its long residence in the lowlands of an island where there\r\nis little permanent snow, and where assimilation in colour to the heather\r\namong which it lurks is at all times its best protection. In either case it\r\nis equally interesting, as the one large and handsome bird which is\r\npeculiar to our islands notwithstanding their recent separation from the\r\ncontinent.\r\n\r\nThe following is a list of the birds now held to be peculiar to the British\r\nIsles:--\r\n\r\n  1.  Parus ater, _sub. sp._ BRITANNICUS  Closely allied to _P. ater_ of\r\n                                          the continent; a local race or\r\n                                          sub-species.\r\n\r\n  2.  Acredula caudata, _sub. sp._ ROSEA  Allied to _A. caudata_ of the\r\n                                          continent.\r\n\r\n  3.  LAGOPUS SCOTICUS                    Allied to _L. albus_ of\r\n                                          Scandinavia, a distinct species.\r\n\r\n_Freshwater Fishes._--Although the productions of fresh waters have\r\ngenerally, as Mr. Darwin has shown, a wide range, fishes appear to form an\r\nexception, many of them being extremely limited in distribution. Some are\r\nconfined to particular river valleys or even to single rivers, others\r\ninhabit the lakes of a limited district only, while some are {341} confined\r\nto single lakes, often of small area, and these latter offer examples of\r\nthe most restricted distribution of any organisms whatever. Cases of this\r\nkind are found in our own islands, and deserve our especial attention. It\r\nhas long been known that some of our lakes possessed peculiar species of\r\ntrout and charr, but how far these were unknown on the continent, and how\r\nmany of those in different parts of our islands were really distinct, had\r\nnot been ascertained till Dr. Guenther, so well known for his extensive\r\nknowledge of the species of fishes, obtained numerous specimens from every\r\npart of the country, and by comparison with all known continental species\r\ndetermined their specific differences. The striking and unexpected result\r\nhas thus been attained, that no less than fifteen well-marked species of\r\nfreshwater fishes are altogether peculiar to the British Islands. The\r\nfollowing is the list, with their English names and localities:--[83]\r\n\r\n_Freshwater Fishes peculiar to the British Isles._\r\n\r\n        _Latin Name._      | _English Name._   |        _Locality._\r\n                           |                   |\r\n   1.

Some\r\nof them, like _S. killinensis_ and the Coregoni are in fact, as Dr.\r\nGuenther assures me, just as good and distinct species as any other\r\nrecognised species of fish. It may indeed be objected that, until all the\r\nsmall lakes of Scandinavia are explored, and their fishes compared with\r\nours, we cannot be sure that we have any peculiar species. But this\r\nobjection has very little weight if we consider how our own species vary\r\nfrom lake to lake and from island to island, so that the Orkney species is\r\nnot found in Scotland, and only one of the peculiar British species extends\r\nto Ireland, which has no less than five species altogether peculiar to it.\r\nIf the species of our own two islands are thus distinct, what reason have\r\nwe for believing that they will be otherwise than distinct from those of\r\nScandinavia? At all events, with the amount of evidence we already possess\r\nof the very restricted ranges of many of our species, we must certainly\r\nhold them to be peculiar till they have been proved to be otherwise.\r\n\r\nThe great speciality of the Irish fishes is very interesting, because it is\r\njust what we should expect on the theory of evolution. In Ireland the two\r\nmain causes of specific change--isolation and altered conditions--are each\r\nmore powerful than in Britain. Whatever difficulty continental fishes may\r\nhave in passing over to Britain, that difficulty will certainly be\r\nincreased by the second sea passage to Ireland; and the latter country has\r\nbeen longer isolated, for the Irish Sea with its northern and southern\r\nchannels is considerably deeper than the German Ocean and the {343} Eastern\r\nhalf of the English Channel, so that, when the last subsidence occurred,\r\nIreland would have been an island for some length of time while England and\r\nScotland still formed part of the continent. Again, whatever differences\r\nhave been produced by the exceptional climate of our islands will have been\r\ngreater in Ireland, where insular conditions are at a maximum, the\r\nabundance of moisture and the equability of temperature being far more\r\npronounced than in any other part of Europe.\r\n\r\nAmong the remarkable instances of limited distribution afforded by these\r\nfishes, we have the Loch Stennis trout confined to the little group of\r\nlakes in the mainland of Orkney, occupying altogether an area of about ten\r\nmiles by three; the Welsh charr confined to the Llanberris lakes, about\r\nthree miles in length; Gray's charr confined to Lough Melvin, about seven\r\nmiles long; while the Loch Killin charr, known only from a small mountain\r\nlake in Inverness-shire, and the vendace, from the equally small lakes at\r\nLoch Maben in Scotland, are two examples of restricted distribution which\r\ncan hardly be surpassed.\r\n\r\n_Cause of Great Speciality in Fishes._--The reason why fishes alone should\r\nexhibit such remarkable local modifications in lakes and islands is\r\nsufficiently obvious. It is due to the extreme rarity of their transmission\r\nfrom one lake to another. Just as we found to be the case in Oceanic\r\nIslands, where the means of transmission were ample hardly any modification\r\nof species occurred, while where these means were deficient and individuals\r\nonce transported remained isolated during a long succession of ages, their\r\nforms and characters became so much changed as to bring about what we term\r\ndistinct species or even distinct genera,--so these lake fishes have become\r\nmodified because the means by which they are enabled to migrate so rarely\r\noccur. It is quite in accordance with this view that some of the smaller\r\nlakes contain no fishes, because none have ever been conveyed to them.\r\nOthers contain several; and some fishes which have peculiarities of\r\nconstitution or habits which render their transmission somewhat less\r\ndifficult occur in several lakes over a wide area of country, though only\r\none appears to be common to the British and Irish lakes. {344}\r\n\r\nThe manner in which fishes are enabled to migrate from lake to lake is\r\nunknown, but many suggestions have been made. It is a fact that whirlwinds\r\nand waterspouts sometimes carry living fish in considerable numbers and\r\ndrop them on the land. Here is one mode which might certainly have acted\r\nnow and then in the course of thousands of years, and the eggs of fishes\r\nmay have been carried with even greater ease. Again we may well suppose\r\nthat some of these fish have once inhabited the streams that enter or flow\r\nout of the lakes as well as the lakes themselves; and this opens a wide\r\nfield for conjecture as to modes of migration, because we know that rivers\r\nhave sometimes changed their courses to such an extent as to form a union\r\nwith distinct river basins. This has been effected either by floods rising\r\nover low watersheds, by elevations of the land changing lines of drainage,\r\nor by ice blocking up valleys and compelling the streams to flow over\r\nwatersheds to find an outlet. This is known to have occurred during the\r\nglacial epoch, and is especially manifest in the case of the Parallel Roads\r\nof Glenroy, and it probably affords the true solution of many of the cases\r\nin which existing species of fish inhabit distinct river basins whether in\r\nstreams or lakes. If a fish thus wandered out of one river-basin into\r\nanother, it might then retire up the streams to some of the lakes, where\r\nalone it might find conditions favourable to it. By a combination of the\r\nmodes of migration here indicated it is not difficult to understand how so\r\nmany species are now common to the lakes of Wales, Cumberland, and\r\nScotland, while others less able to adapt themselves to different\r\nconditions have survived only in one or two lakes in a single district; or\r\nthese last may have been originally identical with other forms, but have\r\nbecome modified by the particular conditions of the lake in which they have\r\nfound themselves isolated.\r\n\r\n_Peculiar British Insects._--We now come to the class of insects, and here\r\nwe have much more difficulty in determining what are the actual facts,\r\nbecause new species are still being yearly discovered and considerable\r\nportions of Europe are but imperfectly explored. It often happens that an\r\ninsect is discovered in our islands, and for some {345} years Britain is\r\nits only recorded locality; but at length it is found on some part of the\r\ncontinent, and not unfrequently has been all the time known there, but\r\ndisguised by another name, or by being classed as a variety of some other\r\nspecies. This has occurred so often that our best entomologists have come\r\nto take it for granted that _all_ our supposed peculiar British species are\r\nreally natives of the continent and will one day be found there; and owing\r\nto this feeling little trouble has been taken to bring together the names\r\nof such as from time to time remain known from this country only. The view\r\nof the probable identity of our entire insect-fauna with that of the\r\ncontinent has been held by such well-known authorities as the late Mr.\r\nE. C. Rye and Dr. D. Sharp for the beetles, and by Mr. H. T. Stainton for\r\nbutterflies and moths; but as we have already seen that among two orders of\r\nvertebrates--birds and fishes--there are undoubtedly peculiar British\r\nspecies, it seems to me that all the probabilities are in favour of there\r\nbeing a much larger number of peculiar species of insects. In every other\r\nisland where some of the vertebrates are peculiar--as in the Azores, the\r\nCanaries, the Andaman Islands, and Ceylon--the insects show an equal if not\r\na higher proportion of speciality, and there seems no reason whatever why\r\nthe same law should not apply to us. Our climate is undoubtedly very\r\ndistinct from that of any part of the continent, and in Scotland, Ireland,\r\nand Wales we possess extensive tracts of wild mountainous country where a\r\nmoist uniform climate, an alpine or northern vegetation, and a considerable\r\namount of isolation, offer all the conditions requisite for the\r\npreservation of some species which may have become extinct elsewhere, and\r\nfor the slight modification of others since our last separation from the\r\ncontinent. I think, therefore, that it will be very interesting to take\r\nstock, as it were, of our recorded peculiarities in the insect world, for\r\nit is only by so doing that we can hope to arrive at any correct solution\r\nof the question on which there is at present so much difference of opinion.\r\nFor the list of Coleoptera with the accompanying notes I was originally\r\nindebted to the late Mr. E. C. Rye; and Dr. Sharp also gave me valuable\r\ninformation as to the recent {346} occurrence of some of the supposed\r\npeculiar species on the continent. The list has now been revised by the\r\nRev. Canon Fowler, author of the best modern work on the British\r\nColeoptera, who has kindly furnished some valuable notes.\r\n\r\nFor the Lepidoptera I first noted all the species and varieties marked as\r\nBritish only in Staudinger's Catalogue of European Lepidoptera. This list\r\nwas carefully corrected by Mr. Stainton, who weeded out all the species\r\nknown by him to have been since discovered, and furnished me with valuable\r\ninformation on the distribution and habits of the species. This information\r\noften has a direct bearing on the probability of the insect being peculiar\r\nto Britain, and in some cases may be said to explain why it should be so.\r\nFor example, the larvae of some of our peculiar species of Tineina feed\r\nduring the winter, which they are enabled to do owing to our mild and\r\ninsular climate, but which the severer continental winters render\r\nimpossible. A curious example of the effect this habit may have on\r\ndistribution is afforded by one of our commonest British species,\r\n_Elachista rufocinerea_, the larva of which mines in the leaves of _Holcus\r\nmollis_ and other grasses from December to March. This species, though\r\ncommon everywhere with us, extending to Scotland and Ireland, is quite\r\nunknown in similar latitudes on the continent, but appears again in Italy,\r\nthe South of France, and Dalmatia, where the mild winters enable it to live\r\nin its accustomed manner.\r\n\r\nSuch cases as this afford an excellent illustration of those changes of\r\ndistribution, dependent probably on recent changes of climate, which may\r\nhave led to the restriction of certain species to our islands. For should\r\nany change of climate lead to the extinction of the species in South\r\nEurope, where it is far less abundant than with us, we should have a common\r\nand wide-spread species entirely restricted to our islands. Other species\r\nfeed in the larva state on our common gorse, a plant found only in limited\r\nportions of Western and Southern Europe; and the presence of this plant in\r\na mild and insular climate such as ours may well be supposed to have led to\r\nthe preservation of some of the numerous species which are or have been\r\ndependent on it. Since the first edition was {347} published many new\r\nBritish species have been discovered, while some of the supposed peculiar\r\nspecies have been found on the continent. Information as to these has been\r\nkindly furnished by Mr. W. Warren, Mr. C. G. Barrett, Lord Walsingham, and\r\nother students of British Lepidoptera, and the first-named gentleman has\r\nalso looked over the proofs.\r\n\r\nMr. McLachlan has kindly furnished me with some valuable information on\r\ncertain species of Trichoptera or Caddis flies which seem to be peculiar to\r\nour islands; and this completes the list of orders which have been studied\r\nwith sufficient care to afford materials for such a comparison. We will now\r\ngive the list of peculiar British Insects, beginning with the Lepidoptera\r\nand adding such notes as have been supplied by the gentlemen already\r\nreferred to.\r\n\r\n_List of the Species or Varieties of Lepidoptera which, so far as at\r\npresent known, are confined to the British Islands.

Common on\r\n    _Statice limonium_.\r\n\r\nWe have here a list of eighty-nine species, which, according to the best\r\nauthorities, are, in the present state of our knowledge, peculiar to\r\nBritain. It is a curious fact that no less than fifty of these have been\r\ndescribed more than twenty-five years; and as during all that time they\r\nhave not been recognised on the continent, notwithstanding that good\r\ncoloured figures exist of almost all of them, it seems highly probable that\r\nmany of them are really confined to our island. At the same time we must\r\nnot apply this argument too rigidly, for the very day before my visit to\r\nMr. Stainton he had received a letter from Professor Zeller announcing the\r\ndiscovery on the continent of a species of our last family, Pterophorina,\r\nwhich for more than forty years had been considered to be exclusively\r\nBritish. This insect, _Platyptilia similidactyla_ (_Pterophorus\r\nisodactylus_, Stainton's _Manual_), had been taken rarely in the extreme\r\nnorth and south of our islands--Teignmouth and Orkney, a fact which seemed\r\nsomewhat indicative of its being a straggler. Again, seven of the species\r\nare unique, that is, have only been captured once; and it may be supposed\r\nthat, as they are so rare as to have been found only once in England, they\r\nmay be all {351} equally rare and not yet found on the continent. But this\r\nis hardly in accordance with the laws of distribution. Widely scattered\r\nspecies are generally abundant in some localities; while, when a species is\r\non the point of extinction, it must for a time be very rare in the single\r\nlocality where it last maintains itself. It is then more probable that some\r\nof these unique species represent such as are almost extinct, than that\r\nthey have a wide range and are equally rare everywhere; and the peculiarity\r\nof our insular climate, combined with our varied soil and vegetation, offer\r\nconditions which may favour the survival of some species with us after they\r\nhave become extinct on the continent.\r\n\r\nOf the sixty-nine species recorded in my first edition fourteen have been\r\nsince discovered on the continent, while no less than twenty-two species\r\nand eleven varieties have been added to the list. As we can hardly suppose\r\ncontinental entomologists to be less thorough collectors than ourselves, it\r\nought to be more and more difficult to find any insects which are unknown\r\non the continent if all ours really exist there; and the fact that the list\r\nof apparently peculiar British species is an increasing one renders it\r\nprobable that many of them are not only apparently but really so. Both\r\ngeneral considerations dependent on the known laws of distribution, and the\r\npeculiar habits, conspicuous appearance, and restricted range, of many of\r\nour species, alike indicate that some considerable proportion of them will\r\nremain permanently as peculiar British species.\r\n\r\nWe will now pass on to the Coleoptera, or beetles, an order which has been\r\nof late years energetically collected and carefully studied by British\r\nentomologists.\r\n\r\n_List of the Species and Varieties of Beetles which, so far as at present\r\nknown, are confined to the British Islands.

SCYMNUS LIVIDUS (Bold). Northumberland. A doubtful species.\r\n\r\nOf the sixty-seven species and varieties of beetles in the preceding list,\r\na considerable number no doubt owe their presence there to the fact that\r\nthey have not yet been discovered or recognised on the continent. This is\r\nalmost certainly the case with many of those which have been separated from\r\nother species by very minute and obscure characters, and especially with\r\nthe excessively minute Trichopterygidae described by Mr. Matthews. There\r\nare others, however, to which this mode of getting rid of them will not\r\napply, as they are so marked as to be at once recognised by any competent\r\nentomologist, and often so plentiful that they can be easily obtained when\r\nsearched for. The peculiar species of Apion in the Shetland Islands is\r\ninteresting, and may be connected with the very peculiar climatal\r\nconditions there prevailing, which have led in some cases to a change of\r\nhabits, so that a species of weevil (_Otiorhynchus maurus_) always found on\r\nmountain sides in Scotland here occurs on the sea-shore. Still more curious\r\nis the occurrence of two distinct forms (a species and a well-marked\r\nvariety) on the small granitic Lundy Island in the Bristol Channel. This\r\nisland is about three miles long and twelve from the coast of Devonshire,\r\nconsisting mainly of granite with a little of the Devonian formation, and\r\nthe presence here of peculiar insects can only be due to isolation with\r\nspecial conditions, and immunity from enemies or competing forms. When we\r\nconsider the similar islands off {355} the coast of Scotland and Ireland,\r\nwith the Isle of Man and the Scilly Islands, none of which have been yet\r\nthoroughly explored for beetles, it is probable that many similar examples\r\nof peculiar isolated forms remain to be discovered.\r\n\r\nLooking, then, at what seem to me the probabilities of the case from the\r\nstandpoint of evolution and natural selection, and giving due weight to the\r\nfacts of local distribution as they are actually presented to us, I am\r\nforced to differ from the opinion held by our best entomological\r\nauthorities, and to believe that some at least, perhaps many, of the\r\nspecies which, in the present state of our knowledge, appear to be peculiar\r\nto our islands, are, not only apparently, but really, so peculiar.\r\n\r\nI am indebted to Mr. Robert McLachlan for the following information on\r\ncertain Trichopterous Neuroptera (or caddis-flies) which appear to be\r\nconfined to our islands. The peculiar aquatic habits of the larvae of these\r\ninsects, some living in ponds or rivers, others in lakes, and others again\r\nonly in clear mountain streams, render it not improbable that some of them\r\nshould have become isolated and preserved in our islands, or that they\r\nshould be modified owing to such isolation.\r\n\r\n_Trichoptera peculiar to the British Isles._\r\n\r\n    1. PHILOPOTAMUS INSULARIS. (? A variety of _P. montanus_.)--This can\r\n    hardly be termed a British species or variety, because, so far as at\r\n    present known, it is peculiar to the Island of Guernsey. It agrees\r\n    structurally with _P. montanus_, a species found both in Britain and on\r\n    the continent, but it differs in its strikingly yellow colour, and less\r\n    pronounced markings. All the specimens from Guernsey are alike, and\r\n    resident entomologists assured Mr. McLachlan that no other kind is\r\n    known. Strange to say, some examples from Jersey differ considerably,\r\n    resembling the common European and British form. Even should this\r\n    peculiar variety be at some future time found on the continent it would\r\n    still be a remarkable fact that the form of insect inhabiting two small\r\n    islands only twenty miles apart should constantly differ; but as Jersey\r\n    is between Guernsey and the coast, it seems just possible that the more\r\n    insular conditions, and perhaps some peculiarity of the soil and water\r\n    in the former island, have really led to the production or preservation\r\n    of a well-marked variety of insect. In the first edition of this work\r\n    two other species were named as then, peculiar to Britain--Setodes\r\n    argentipunctella and Rhyacophila munda, but both have now been taken on\r\n    the continent.\r\n\r\n    2. MESOPHYLAX IMPUNCTATUS, _var._ ZETLANDICUS.--A variety of a South\r\n    and Central European species, one specimen of which has been found in\r\n    Dumfriesshire. The variety is distinguished by its small size and dark\r\n    colour.\r\n\r\n{356}\r\n\r\n_Land and Freshwater Shells._--In the first edition of this work four\r\nspecies were noted as being, so far as was then known, exclusively British.\r\nTwo of these, _Cyclas pisidioides_ (now called _Sphaerium pisidioides_) and\r\n_Geomalacus maculosus_, have been discovered on the continent, but the\r\nother two remain still apparently confined to these islands; and to these\r\nanother has been added by the discovery of a new species of Hydrobia in the\r\nestuary of the Thames. The peculiar species now stands as follows:--\r\n\r\n    1. LIMNEA INVOLUTA.--A pond snail with a small polished amber-coloured\r\n    shell found only in a small alpine lake and its inflowing stream on\r\n    Cromagloun mountain near the lakes of Killarney. It was discovered in\r\n    1838, and has frequently been obtained since in the same locality. It\r\n    is sometimes classed as a variety of _Limnea peregra_, and is at all\r\n    events closely allied to that species.\r\n\r\n    2. HYDROBIA JENKINSII.--A small shell of the family Rissoidae\r\n    inhabiting the Thames estuary both in Essex and Kent. It was discovered\r\n    only a few years ago, and was first described in 1889.\r\n\r\n    3. ASSIMINEA GRAYANA.--A small estuarine pulmonobranch found on the\r\n    banks of the Thames between Greenwich and Gravesend, on mud at the\r\n    roots of aquatic plants. It has been discovered more than sixty years.\r\n\r\nBut besides the above-named species there are a considerable number of\r\nwell-marked varieties of shells which seem to be peculiar to our islands. A\r\nlist of these has been kindly furnished me by Mr. Theo. D. A. Cockerell,\r\nwho has paid much attention to the subject; and after omitting all those\r\nwhose peculiarities are very slight or whose absence from the continent is\r\ndoubtful, there remain a series of forms some of which are in all\r\nprobability really endemic with us. This is the more probable from the fact\r\nthat an introduced colony of _Helix nemoralis_ at Lexington, Virginia,\r\npresents numerous varieties among which are several which do not occur in\r\nEurope.[84] The following list is therefore given in the hope that it may\r\nbe useful in calling attention to those varieties which are not yet\r\npositively known to occur elsewhere than in our islands, and {357} thus\r\nlead, ultimately, to a more accurate knowledge of the facts. It is only by\r\nobtaining a full knowledge of varieties, their distribution and their\r\ncomparative stability, that we can ever hope to detect the exact process by\r\nwhich nature works in the formation of species.\r\n\r\nLIST OF THE SPECIES AND VARIETIES OF LAND AND FRESHWATER SHELLS WHICH, SO\r\nFAR AS AT PRESENT KNOWN, ARE BELIEVED TO BE PECULIAR TO THE BRITISH ISLES\r\nOR NOT FOUND ON THE CONTINENT.\r\n\r\n    LIMACIDAE.\r\n\r\n    1.

C. Watson, who very kindly gave me the information I required,\r\nand I cannot do better than quote his words: \"It may be stated pretty\r\nconfidently that there is no 'species' (generally accepted among botanists\r\nas a good species) peculiar to the British Isles. True, during the past\r\nhundred years, nominally new species have been named and described on\r\nBritish specimens only, from time to time. But these have gradually come to\r\nbe identified with species described elsewhere under other names--or they\r\nhave been reduced in rank by succeeding botanists, and placed or replaced\r\nas varieties of more widely distributed species. In his _British Rubi_\r\nProfessor Babington includes as good species, some half-dozen which he has,\r\napparently, not identified with any foreign species or variety. None of\r\nthese are accepted as 'true species,' nor even as 'sub-species' in the\r\n_Students' Flora_, where the brambles are described by Baker, a botanist\r\nwell acquainted with the plants of Britain. And as all these nominal\r\nspecies of Rubi are of late creation, they have truly never been subjected\r\nto real or critical tests as 'species.'\"\r\n\r\nIn my first edition I was only able to name four species, sub-species, or\r\nvarieties of flowering plants which were believed to be unknown on the\r\ncontinent. But much attention has of late years been paid to the critical\r\nexamination of British plants in comparison with continental specimens, and\r\nI am now enabled to give a much more {360} extensive list of the species or\r\nforms which at present seem to be peculiar. For the following list I am\r\nprimarily indebted to Mr. Arthur Bennett of Croydon. Sir Joseph Hooker has\r\nbeen so kind as to examine it carefully and to give me his conclusions on\r\nthe relative value of the differences of the several forms, and Mr. Baker,\r\nof Kew, has also assisted with his extensive knowledge of British plants.\r\n\r\n    LIST OF SPECIES, SUB-SPECIES, AND VARIETIES OF FLOWERING PLANTS FOUND\r\n    IN GREAT BRITAIN OR IRELAND, BUT NOT AT PRESENT KNOWN IN CONTINENTAL\r\n    EUROPE. BY ARTHUR BENNETT, F.L.S. THE MOST DISTINCT AND BEST DETERMINED\r\n    FORMS ARE MARKED WITH AN ASTERISK.\r\n\r\n    1. *Caltha radicans (Forst.). \"A much disputed species, or form of _C.\r\n    palustris_. It is a relatively rare plant.\" (J. D. H.) \"Certainly\r\n    distinct from the Scandinavian form.\" (Ar. Bennett.)\r\n\r\n    2. *Arabis petraea (Lam.) _var._ grandifolia (Druce). Scotch mountains.\r\n    \"The larger flowers alone distinguish this.\" (J. D. H.)\r\n\r\n    3. Arabis ciliata (R. Br.). In Nyman's _Conspectus Florae Europaeae_\r\n    this species is given as found in England and Ireland only. \"A very\r\n    much disputed form of a plant of very wide distribution in Europe and\r\n    North America.\" (J.

H.)\r\n\r\n    21. *Rubus longithyrsiger (Lees). \"Mr. Baker informs me that this is a\r\n    very distinct plant never yet found on the continent.\" (J. D. H.)\r\n\r\n    22. Pyrus aria (Sm.) _var._ rupicola (Syme). \"A very local form,\r\n    confined to Gt. Britain, and owing its characters to its starved\r\n    position.\" (Baker.)\r\n\r\n    23. Callitriche obtusangula (Le Gall), _var._ Lachii (Warren).\r\n    Cheshire. \"This is intermediate between two sub-species of _C. verna_.\"\r\n    (J. D.

Hieracium nitidum (Backh.). Lower glens of the Scotch Alps. Mr.\r\n    Bennett writes:--\"The following Hieracia have been named by Mr. F. J.\r\n    Hanbury _as endemic forms_. One can only safely say they are certainly\r\n    not known in Scandinavia, as they have all been submitted to Dr.\r\n    Lindeberg. But usually Scotch species are not represented in Central\r\n    Europe to any great extent, though several do occur. Still these new\r\n    forms ought to be critically compared with all Dr. Peters' new\r\n    species.\"\r\n\r\n    35. H. Langewellense (Hanb.). Caithness.\r\n\r\n    36. H. pollinarium (Hanb.).

With regard to all these {362}\r\n    Hieracia Sir Joseph Hooker and Mr. Baker say:--\"No case can be made of\r\n    these. They are local forms with the shadowest of shady characters.\"\r\n    Mr. Bennett writes: \"H. iricum and H.

Nearly 400 specimens I have distributed all over the\r\n    world with requests for information as to anything like it. The\r\n    response is everywhere the same, 'nothing.' The nearest to it occurs in\r\n    the Duchy of Lauenberg but is referable to _P. heterophyllus_.\"\r\n\r\n    59. Potamogeton Griffithii (Ar. Bennett).

Scotland. \"An alpine sub-variety of a variety\r\n    of the protean _P. nemoralis_.\" (J. D. H.)\r\n\r\nIn his comments on this extensive list of supposed peculiar British plants,\r\nSir Joseph Hooker arrives at the following conclusions:--\r\n\r\n    1. There are four unquestionably distinct species which do not occur in\r\n    continental Europe: viz.--\r\n\r\n    _One_ absolutely endemic species, POTAMOGETON LANCEOLATUS.\r\n\r\n    _Three_ American species, SISYRINCHIUM ANGUSTIFOLIUM, SPIRANTHES\r\n    ROMANZOVIANA, ERIOCAULON SEPTANGULARE.\r\n\r\n    2. There are sixteen endemic varieties of British species, viz.--\r\n\r\n    _Eleven_ of more or less variable species, Caltha palustris, _var._\r\n    RADICANS; Polygala vulgaris, _var._ GRANDIFLORA; Cerastium arcticum,\r\n    _var._ EDMONSTONII; Trifolium repens, _var._ TOWNSENDII; Rosa involuta,\r\n    _var._ WILSONI; Rubus fruticosus, _sub-sp._ LONGITHYRSIGER; Campanula\r\n    rotundifolia, _var._ SPECIOSA; Erythraea centaurium, _sub-sp._\r\n    LATIFOLIA; Carex involuta, (? Hyb.); Carex vesicaria, _var._ GRAHAMI;\r\n    Deyeuxia neglecta, _var._ HOOKERI.\r\n\r\n    _Five_ of comparatively well limited species. Arabis petraea, _var._\r\n    GRANDIFOLIA; Helianthemum guttatum, _var._ BREWERI; Geranium\r\n    sanguineum, _var._ LANCASTRIENSE; Oenanthe Phellandrium, _var._\r\n    FLUVIATILIS; Spartium stricta, _var._ TOWNSENDI.\r\n\r\nThe above twenty species are marked in the list with an asterisk. Of the\r\nremaining fifty-five, Sir Joseph Hooker says, \"that for various reasons it\r\nwould not be safe to rely on them as evidence. In most cases the varietal\r\nform is so very trifling a departure from the type that this may be safely\r\nset down to a local cause, and is probably not constant. In others the\r\nplant is doubtfully endemic; in still others a hybrid.\"\r\n\r\nEven should it ultimately prove that of the whole number of the fifty-five\r\ndoubtful forms none are established as peculiar British varieties, the\r\nnumber admitted after so {364} rigorous an examination is about what we\r\nshould expect in comparison with the limited amount of speciality we have\r\nseen to exist in other groups. The three American species which inhabit the\r\nextreme west and north-west of the British Isles, but are not found on the\r\ncontinent of Europe are especially interesting, because they demonstrate\r\nthe existence of some peculiar conditions such as would help to explain the\r\npresence of the other peculiar species. Whether we suppose these American\r\nforms to have migrated from America to Europe before the glacial epoch, or\r\nto be the remnants of a vegetation once spread over the north temperate\r\nzone, we can only explain their presence with us and not further east by\r\nsomething favourable either in our insular climate or in the limited\r\ncompetition due to our comparative poverty in species.\r\n\r\nAbout half of the peculiar forms are found in the extreme west or north of\r\nBritain or in Ireland, where peculiar insular conditions are at a maximum;\r\nand the influence of these conditions is further shown by the number of\r\nspecies of West or South European plants which occur in the same districts.\r\n\r\nWe may here notice the interesting fact that Ireland possesses no less than\r\ntwenty species or sub-species of flowering plants not found in Britain, and\r\nsome of these _may_ be altogether peculiar. As a whole they show the effect\r\nof the pre-eminently mild and insular climate of Ireland in extending the\r\nrange of some south European species. The following list of these plants,\r\nfor which I am indebted to Mr. A. G.

(And in Germany, Arctic Europe, and North America.)\r\n\r\nWe find here nine south-west European species which probably had a wider\r\nrange in mild preglacial times, and have been preserved in the south and\r\nwest of Ireland owing to its milder climate. It must be remembered that\r\nduring the height of the glacial epoch Ireland was continental, so that\r\nthese plants may have followed the retreating ice to their present stations\r\nand survived the subsequent depression. This seems more probable than that\r\nso many species should have reached Ireland for the first time during the\r\nlast union with the continent subsequent to the glacial epoch. The Arctic,\r\nAlpine, and American plants may all be examples of species which once had a\r\nwider range, and which, owing to the more favourable conditions, have\r\ncontinued to exist in Ireland while becoming extinct in the adjacent parts\r\nof Britain and Western Europe.\r\n\r\nAs contrasted with the extreme scarcity of peculiar species among the\r\nflowering plants, it is the more interesting and unexpected to find a\r\nconsiderable number of peculiar mosses and Hepaticae, some of which present\r\nus with phenomena of distribution of a very remarkable character. For the\r\nfollowing lists and the information as to the distribution of the genera\r\nand species I am indebted to Mr. William Mitten, one of the first\r\nauthorities on these beautiful little plants.

Braithwaite, and several species of\r\nhepaticae have been added by Mr. Mitten. {366}\r\n\r\nLIST OF THE SPECIES OF MOSSES AND HEPATICAE WHICH ARE PECULIAR TO THE\r\nBRITISH ISLES (OR NOT FOUND IN EUROPE).\r\n\r\n(_Those belonging to non-European genera in Italics._)\r\n\r\nMOSSES.\r\n\r\n   1.

We cannot\r\ntherefore lay any stress on these individually as being absent from the\r\ncontinent of Europe so much of which is imperfectly explored, though it is\r\nprobable that several of them are really confined to Britain. But there are\r\na few--indicated by italics--which are in a very different category; for\r\nthey belong to genera which are altogether unknown in any other part of\r\nEurope, and their nearest allies are to be found in the tropics or in the\r\nsouthern hemisphere. The four non-European genera of mosses to which we\r\nrefer all have their maximum of development in the Andes, while the three\r\nnon-European Hepaticae appear to have their maximum in the temperate\r\nregions of the southern hemisphere. Mr. Mitten has kindly furnished me with\r\nthe following particulars of the distribution of these genera:--\r\n\r\n    BARTRAMIDULA. Asia, Africa, S. America and Australia, but not Europe or\r\n    N. America.\r\n\r\n    STREPTOPOGON is a comparatively small genus, with seven species in the\r\n    Andes, one in the Himalayas, and three in the south temperate zone,\r\n    besides our English species.\r\n\r\n    DALTONIA is a large genus of inconspicuous mosses, having seventeen\r\n    species in the Andes, two in Brazil, two in Mexico, one in the\r\n    Galapagos, six in India and Ceylon, five in Java, two in Africa, and\r\n    three in the Antarctic Islands, and one in Ireland.\r\n\r\n    HOOKERIA (restricting that term to the species referable to\r\n    Cyclodictyon) is still a large genus of handsome and remarkable mosses,\r\n    having twenty-six species in the Andes, eleven in Brazil, eight in the\r\n    Antilles, one in Mexico, two in the Pacific Islands, one in New\r\n    Zealand, one in Java, one in India, and five in Africa--besides our\r\n    British species, which is found also in Madeira and the Azores but in\r\n    no part of Europe proper.\r\n\r\nThese last two are very remarkable cases of distribution, since Mr. Mitten\r\nassures me that the plants are so markedly different from all other mosses\r\nthat they would scarcely be overlooked in Europe.\r\n\r\nThe distribution of the non-European genera of Hepaticae is as follows:--\r\n\r\n    CHASMATOCOLIA. South America and Ireland.\r\n\r\n    ACROBOLBUS. A small genus found only in New Zealand and the adjacent\r\n    islands, besides Ireland.\r\n\r\n    {368} PETALOPHYLLUM. A small genus confined to Australia and New\r\n    Zealand in the southern hemisphere, Algeria, and Ireland in the\r\n    northern. We have also one of the Hepaticae--_Mastigophora\r\n    Woodsii_--found in Ireland and the Himalayas, but unknown in any part\r\n    of continental Europe. The genus is most developed in New Zealand.\r\n\r\nThese are certainly very interesting facts, but they are by no means so\r\nexceptional in this group of plants as to throw any doubt upon their\r\naccuracy. The Atlantic islands present very similar phenomena in the\r\n_Rhamphidium purpuratum_, whose nearest allies are in the West Indies and\r\nSouth America; and in three species of Sciaromium, whose only allies are in\r\nNew Zealand, Tasmania, and the Andes of Bogota. An analogous and equally\r\ncurious fact is the occurrence in the Drontheim mountains in Central\r\nNorway, of a little group of four or five peculiar species of mosses of the\r\ngenus Mnium, which are found nowhere else; although the genus extends over\r\nEurope, India, and the southern hemisphere, but always represented by a\r\nvery few wide-ranging species except in this one mountain group![85]\r\n\r\nSuch facts show us the wonderful delicacy of the balance of conditions\r\nwhich determine the existence of particular species in any locality. The\r\nspores of mosses and Hepaticae are so minute that they must be continually\r\ncarried through the air to great distances, and we can hardly doubt that,\r\nso far as its powers of diffusion are concerned, any species which fruits\r\nfreely might soon spread itself over the whole world. That they do not do\r\nso must depend on peculiarities of habit and constitution, which fit the\r\ndifferent species for restricted stations and special climatic conditions;\r\nand according as the adaptation is more general, or the degree of\r\nspecialisation extreme, species will have wide or restricted ranges.\r\nAlthough their fossil remains have been rarely detected, we can hardly\r\ndoubt that mosses have as high an antiquity as ferns or Lycopods; and\r\ncoupling this antiquity with their great powers of dispersal we may\r\nunderstand how many of the genera have come to occupy a number of detached\r\nareas scattered over the whole earth, but {369} always such as afford the\r\npeculiar conditions of climate and soil best suited to them. The repeated\r\nchanges of temperature and other climatic conditions, which, as we have\r\nseen, occurred through all the later geological epochs, combined with those\r\nslower changes caused by geographical mutations, must have greatly affected\r\nthe distribution of such ubiquitous yet delicately organised plants as\r\nmosses. Throughout countless ages they must have been in a constant state\r\nof comparatively rapid migration, driven to and fro by every physical and\r\norganic change, often subject to modification of structure or habit, but\r\nalways seizing upon every available spot in which they could even\r\ntemporarily maintain themselves.[86]\r\n\r\nHere then we have a group in which there is no question of the means of\r\ndispersal; and where the difficulties that present themselves are not how\r\nthe species reached the remote localities in which they are now found, but\r\nrather why they have not established themselves in {370} many other\r\nstations which, so far as we can judge, seem equally suitable to them. Yet\r\nit is a curious fact, that the phenomena of distribution actually presented\r\nby this group do not essentially differ from those presented by the higher\r\nflowering plants which have apparently far less diffusive power, as we\r\nshall find when we come to treat of the floras of oceanic islands; and we\r\nbelieve that the explanation of this is, that the life of _species_, and\r\nespecially of _genera_, is often so prolonged as to extend over whole\r\ncycles of such terrestrial mutations as we have just referred to; and that\r\nthus the majority of plants are afforded means of dispersal which are\r\nusually sufficient to carry them into all suitable localities on the globe.\r\nHence it follows that their actual existence in such localities depends\r\nmainly upon vigour of constitution and adaptation to conditions just as it\r\ndoes in the case of the lower and more rapidly diffused groups, and only\r\npartially on superior facilities for diffusion. This important principle\r\nwill be used further on to afford a solution of some of the most difficult\r\nproblems in the distribution of plant life.[87]\r\n\r\n_Concluding Remarks on the Peculiarities of the British Fauna and\r\nFlora._--The facts, now I believe for the first time brought together,\r\nrespecting the peculiarities of the British fauna and flora, are sufficient\r\nto show that there is considerable scope for the study of geographical\r\ndistribution even in so apparently unpromising a field as one of the most\r\nrecent of continental islands. Looking at the general bearing of these\r\nfacts, they prove, that the idea so generally entertained as to the\r\nbiological identity of the British Isles with the adjacent continent is not\r\naltogether correct. Among birds we have undoubted peculiarities in at least\r\nthree instances; peculiar fishes are much more numerous, and in this case\r\nthe fact that the Irish species {371} are almost all different from the\r\nBritish, and those of the Orkneys distinct from those of Scotland, renders\r\nit almost certain that the great majority of the fifteen peculiar British\r\nfishes are really peculiar and will never be found on the European\r\nContinent. The mosses and Hepaticae also have been sufficiently collected\r\nin Europe to render it pretty certain that the more remarkable of the\r\npeculiar British forms are not found there; why therefore, it may be well\r\nasked, should there not be a proportionate number of peculiar British\r\ninsects? It is true that numerous species have been first discovered in\r\nBritain, and, subsequently, on the continent; but we have many species\r\nwhich have been known for twenty, thirty, or forty years, some of which are\r\nnot rare with us, and yet have never been found on the continent. We have\r\nalso the curious fact of our outlying islands, such as the Shetland Isles,\r\nthe Isle of Man, and the little Lundy Island, possessing each some peculiar\r\nforms which, _certainly_, do not exist on our principal island which has\r\nbeen so very thoroughly worked. Analogy, therefore, would lead us to\r\nconclude that many other species or varieties would exist on our islands\r\nand not on the continent; and when we find that a very large number (150)\r\nin three orders only, are so recorded, we may I think be sure that some\r\nconsiderable portion of these (though how many we cannot say) are really\r\nendemic British species.\r\n\r\nThe general laws of distribution also lead us to expect such phenomena.\r\nVery rare and very local species are such as are becoming extinct; and it\r\nis among insects, which are so excessively varied and abundant, which\r\npresent so many isolated forms, and which, even on continents, afford\r\nnumerous examples of very rare species confined to restricted areas, that\r\nwe should have the best chance of meeting with every degree of rarity down\r\nto the point of almost complete extinction. But we know that in all parts\r\nof the world islands are the refuge of species or groups which have become\r\nextinct elsewhere; and it is therefore in the highest degree probable that\r\nsome species which have ceased to exist on the continent should be\r\npreserved in some part or other of our islands, especially {372} as these\r\npresent favourable climatic conditions such as do not exist elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThere is therefore a considerable amount of harmony in the various facts\r\nadduced in this chapter, as well as a complete accordance with what the\r\nlaws of distribution in islands would lead us to expect. In proportion to\r\nthe species of birds and fresh-water fishes, the number of insect-forms is\r\nenormously great, so that the numerous species or varieties here recorded\r\nas not yet known on the continent are not to be wondered at; while it\r\nwould, I think, be almost an anomaly if, with peculiar birds and fishes\r\nthere were _not_ a fair proportion of peculiar insects. Our entomologists\r\nshould, therefore, give up the assumption, that all our insects do exist on\r\nthe continent, and will some time or other be found there, as not in\r\naccordance either with the evidence or the probabilities of the case; and\r\nwhen this is done, and the interesting peculiarities of some of our smaller\r\nislands are remembered, the study of our native animals and plants, in\r\nrelation to those of other countries, will acquire a new interest. The\r\nBritish Isles are said to consist of more than a thousand islands and\r\nislets. How many of these have ever been searched for insects? With the\r\ncase of Lundy Island before us, who shall say that there is not yet scope\r\nfor extensive and interesting investigations into the British fauna and\r\nflora?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{373}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nBORNEO AND JAVA\r\n\r\n    Position and Physical Features of Borneo--Zoological Features of\r\n    Borneo: Mammalia--Birds--The Affinities of the Bornean Fauna--Java, its\r\n    Position and Physical Features--General Character of the Fauna of\r\n    Java--Differences Between the Fauna of Java and that of the other Malay\r\n    Islands--Special Relations of the Javan Fauna to that of the Asiatic\r\n    Continent--Past Geographical Changes of Java and Borneo--The Philippine\r\n    Islands--Concluding Remarks on the Malay Islands.\r\n\r\nAs a representative of recent continental islands situated in the tropics,\r\nwe will take Borneo, since, although perhaps not much more ancient than\r\nGreat Britain, it presents a considerable amount of speciality; and, in its\r\nrelations to the surrounding islands and the Asiatic continent, offers us\r\nsome problems of great interest and considerable difficulty.\r\n\r\nThe accompanying map shows that Borneo is situated on the eastern side of a\r\nsubmarine bank of enormous extent, being about 1,200 miles from north to\r\nsouth, and 1,500 from east to west, and embracing Java, Sumatra, and the\r\nMalay Peninsula. This vast area is all included within the 100 fathom line,\r\nbut by far the larger part of it--from the Gulf of Siam to the Java Sea--is\r\nunder fifty fathoms, or about the same depth as the sea that separates our\r\nown island from the continent. The distance from Borneo to the southern\r\nextremity of the Malay Peninsula is about 350 miles, and it is nearly as\r\nfar from Sumatra and Java, while it is more than 600 miles from the Siamese\r\nPeninsula, opposite to which its long northern coast extends. There is, I\r\nbelieve, nowhere else upon the globe, an island so far from a continent,\r\nyet separated from it by so shallow a sea. Recent changes of sea and land\r\nmust have occurred here on a grand scale, and this adds to the interest\r\nattaching to the study of this large island.\r\n\r\n{374}\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP OF BORNEO AND JAVA, SHOWING THE GREAT SUBMARINE BANK OF\r\nSOUTH-EASTERN ASIA.]\r\n\r\n  The light tint shows a less depth than 100 fathoms.\r\n  The figures show the depth of the sea in fathoms.\r\n\r\n{375} The internal geography of Borneo is somewhat peculiar. A large\r\nportion of its surface is lowland, consisting of great alluvial valleys\r\nwhich penetrate far into the interior; while the mountains except in the\r\nnorth, are of no great elevation, and there are no extensive plateaux. A\r\nsubsidence of 500 feet would allow the sea to fill the great valleys of the\r\nPontianak, Banjarmassing, and Coti rivers, almost to the centre of the\r\nisland, greatly reducing its extent, and causing it to resemble in form the\r\nisland of Celebes to the east of it.\r\n\r\nIn geological structure Borneo is thoroughly continental, possessing\r\nformations of all ages, with basalt and crystalline rocks, but no recent\r\nvolcanoes. It possesses vast beds of coal of Tertiary age; and these, no\r\nless than the great extent of alluvial deposits in its valleys, indicate\r\ngreat changes of level in recent geological times.\r\n\r\nHaving thus briefly indicated those physical features of Borneo which are\r\nnecessary for our inquiry, let us turn to the organic world.\r\n\r\nNeither as regards this great island nor those which surround it, have we\r\nthe amount of detailed information in a convenient form that is required\r\nfor a full elucidation of its past history. We have, however, a tolerable\r\nacquaintance with the two higher groups--mammalia and birds, both of Borneo\r\nand of all the surrounding countries, and to these alone will it be\r\nnecessary to refer in any detail. The most convenient course, and that\r\nwhich will make the subject easiest for the reader, will be to give, first,\r\na connected sketch of what is known of the zoology of Borneo itself, with\r\nthe main conclusions to which they point; and then to discuss the mutual\r\nrelations of some of {376} the adjacent islands, and the series of\r\ngeographical changes that seem required to explain them.\r\n\r\nZOOLOGICAL FEATURES OF BORNEO.\r\n\r\n_Mammalia._--Nearly a hundred and forty species of mammalia have been\r\ndiscovered in Borneo, and of these more than three-fourths are identical\r\nwith those of the surrounding countries, and more than one half with those\r\nof the continent. Among these are two lemurs, nine civets, five cats, five\r\ndeer, the tapir, the elephant, the rhinoceros, and many squirrels, an\r\nassemblage which could certainly only have reached the country by land. The\r\nfollowing species of mammalia are supposed to be peculiar to Borneo:--\r\n\r\n  QUADRUMANA.\r\n  1. Simia morio. A small orangutan\r\n     with large incisor teeth.\r\n  2.

These are Nasalis, the remarkable long-nosed monkey;\r\nRheithrosciurus, a peculiar form of squirrel; and Trichys, a tailless\r\nporcupine. These peculiar forms do not, however, imply that the separation\r\nof the island from the continent is of very ancient date, for the country\r\nis so vast and {377} so much of the once connecting land is covered with\r\nwater, that the amount of speciality is hardly, if at all, greater than\r\noccurs in many continental areas of equal extent and remoteness. This will\r\nbe more evident if we consider that Borneo is as large as the Indo-Chinese\r\nPeninsula, or as the Indian Peninsula south of Bombay, and if either of\r\nthese countries were separated from the continent by the submergence of the\r\nwhole area north of them as far as the Himalayas, they would be found to\r\ncontain quite as many peculiar genera and species as Borneo actually does\r\nnow. A more decisive test of the lapse of time since the separation took\r\nplace is to be found in the presence of a number of representative species\r\nclosely allied to those of the surrounding countries, such as the tailed\r\nmonkeys and the numerous squirrels. These relationships, however, are best\r\nseen among the birds, which have been more thoroughly collected and more\r\ncarefully studied than the mammalia.\r\n\r\n_Birds._--About 580 species of birds are now known to inhabit Borneo, of\r\nwhich 420 species are land-birds.[88] One hundred and eight species are\r\nsupposed to be peculiar to the island, and of these one half have been\r\nnoted, either by Count Salvadori or Mr. Everett, as being either\r\nrepresentative species of, or closely allied to birds inhabiting other\r\nislands or countries. The majority of these are, as might be expected,\r\nallied to species inhabiting the surrounding countries, especially Sumatra,\r\nthe Malay Peninsula, or Java, a smaller number having their representative\r\nforms in the Philippine Islands or Celebes. But there is another group of\r\neight species whose nearest allies are found in such remote lands as\r\nCeylon, North India, Burma, or China. These last have been indicated in the\r\nfollowing list by a double star (**) while those which are representative\r\nof forms found in the immediately surrounding area, and are in many cases\r\nvery slightly differentiated from their allies, are indicated by a single\r\nstar (*). {378}\r\n\r\nLIST OF BIRDS WHICH ARE SUPPOSED TO BE PECULIAR TO BORNEO.\r\n\r\n  TURDIDAE (Thrushes).\r\n\r\n   1. **Cettia oreophila.\r\n   2. *Merula seebohmi.\r\n   3. **Geocichla aurata.\r\n   4. **Myiophoneus borneensis.\r\n   5.

Rallina rufigenys.\r\n\r\nRepresentative forms of the same character as those noted above are found\r\nin all extensive continental areas, but they are rarely so numerous. Thus,\r\nin Mr. Elwes' paper on the \"Distribution of Asiatic Birds,\" he states that\r\n12.5 per cent. of the land birds of Burmah and Tenasserim are peculiar\r\nspecies, whereas we find that in Borneo they are about 25 per cent., and\r\nthe difference may fairly be imputed to the greater proportion of slightly\r\nmodified representative species due to a period of complete isolation. Of\r\npeculiar genera, the Indo-Chinese Peninsula has one--Ampeliceps, a\r\nremarkable yellow-crowned starling, with bare pink-coloured orbits; while\r\ntwo others, Temnurus and Crypsirhina--singular birds allied to the\r\njays--are found in no other part of the Asiatic continent though they occur\r\nin some of the Malay Islands. Borneo has seven peculiar genera of\r\npasseres,[89] as well as Haematortyx, a crested partridge; and Lobiophasis,\r\na pheasant hardly distinct from Euplocamus; while two others, Pityriasis,\r\nan extraordinary bare-headed bird between a jay and a shrike, and\r\nCarpococcyx, a pheasant-like ground cuckoo formerly thought to be peculiar,\r\nare said to have been discovered also in Sumatra.\r\n\r\nThe insects and land-shells of Borneo and of the surrounding countries are\r\ntoo imperfectly known to enable us to arrive at any accurate results with\r\nregard to their distribution. They agree, however, with the birds and\r\nmammals in their general approximation to Malayan forms, but the number of\r\npeculiar species is perhaps larger.\r\n\r\nThe proportion here shown of less than one-fourth peculiar species of\r\nmammalia and fully one-fourth peculiar species of land-birds, teaches us\r\nthat the possession of the power of flight affects but little the\r\ndistribution of {381} land-animals, and gives us confidence in the results\r\nwe may arrive at in those cases where we have, from whatever cause, to\r\ndepend on a knowledge of the birds alone. And if we consider the wide range\r\nof certain groups of powerful flight--as the birds of prey, the swallows\r\nand swifts, the king-crows, and some others, we shall be forced to conclude\r\nthat the majority of forest-birds are restricted by even narrow watery\r\nbarriers, to an even greater extent than mammalia.\r\n\r\n_The Affinities of the Bornean Fauna._--The animals of Borneo exhibit an\r\nalmost perfect identity in general character, and a close similarity in\r\nspecies, with those of Sumatra and the Malay Peninsula. So great is this\r\nresemblance that it is a question whether it might not be quite as great\r\nwere the whole united; for the extreme points of Borneo and Sumatra are\r\n1,500 miles apart--as far as from Madrid to Constantinople, or from the\r\nMissouri valley to California. In such an extent of country we always meet\r\nwith some local species, and representative forms, so that we hardly\r\nrequire any great lapse of time as an element in the production of the\r\npeculiarities we actually find. So far as the forms of life are concerned,\r\nBorneo, as an island, may be no older than Great Britain; for the time that\r\nhas elapsed since the glacial epoch would be amply sufficient to produce\r\nsuch a redistribution of the species, consequent on their mutual relations\r\nbeing disturbed, as would bring the islands into their present zoological\r\ncondition. There are, however, other facts to be considered, which seem to\r\nimply much greater and more complex revolutions than the recent separation\r\nof Borneo from Sumatra and the Malay Peninsula, and that these changes must\r\nhave been spread over a considerable lapse of time. In order to understand\r\nwhat these changes probably were, we must give a brief sketch of the fauna\r\nof Java, the peculiarities of which introduce a new element into the\r\nquestion we have to discuss. {382}\r\n\r\nJAVA.\r\n\r\nThe rich and beautiful island of Java, interesting alike to the politician,\r\nthe geographer, and the naturalist, is more especially attractive to the\r\nstudent of geographical distribution, because it furnishes him with some of\r\nthe most curious anomalies and difficult problems in a place where such\r\nwould be least expected. As Java forms with Sumatra one almost unbroken\r\nline of volcanoes and volcanic mountains, interrupted only by the narrow\r\nStraits of Sunda, we should naturally expect a close resemblance between\r\nthe productions of the two islands. But in point of fact there is a much\r\ngreater difference between them than between Sumatra and Borneo, so much\r\nfurther apart, and so very unlike in physical features.[90] Java differs\r\nfrom the three great land masses--Borneo, Sumatra, and the Malay Peninsula,\r\nfar more than either of these do from each other; and this is the first\r\nanomaly we encounter. But a more serious difficulty than this remains to be\r\nstated. Java has certain close resemblances to the Siamese Peninsula, and\r\nalso to the Himalayas, which Borneo and Sumatra do not exhibit to so great\r\na proportionate extent; and looking at the relative position of these lands\r\nrespectively, this seems most incomprehensible. In order fully to\r\nappreciate the singularity and difficulty of the problem, it will be\r\nnecessary to point out the exact nature and amount of these peculiarities\r\nin the fauna of Java.\r\n\r\n_General Character of the Fauna of Java._--If we were only to take account\r\nof the number of peculiar species in Java, and the relations of its fauna\r\ngenerally to that of the surrounding lands, we might pass it over as a less\r\ninteresting island than Borneo or Sumatra. Its mammalia (ninety species)\r\nare nearly as numerous as those of Borneo, but are apparently less\r\npeculiar, none of the genera and only five or six of the species being\r\nconfined to the island. In land-birds it is decidedly less rich, having\r\nonly 300 species, of which about forty-five are peculiar, and only one\r\n{383} or two belong to peculiar genera; so that here again the amount of\r\nspeciality is considerably less than in Borneo. It is only when we proceed\r\nto analyse the species of the Javan fauna, and trace their distribution and\r\naffinities, that we discover its interesting nature.\r\n\r\n_Difference Between the Fauna of Java and that of the other great Malay\r\nIslands._--Comparing the fauna of Java with that which may be called the\r\ntypical Malayan fauna as exhibited in Borneo, Sumatra, and the Malay\r\nPeninsula, we find the following differences. No less than thirteen genera\r\nof mammalia, each of which is known to inhabit at least two, and generally\r\nall three, of the above-named Malayan countries, are totally absent from\r\nJava; and they include such important forms as the elephant, the tapir, and\r\nthe Malay bear. It cannot be said that this difference depends on imperfect\r\nknowledge, for Java is one of the oldest European settlements in the East,\r\nand has been explored by a long succession of Dutch and English\r\nnaturalists. Every part of it is thoroughly well known, and it would be\r\nalmost as difficult to find a new mammal of any size in Europe as in Java.\r\nOf birds there are twenty-five genera, all typically Malayan and occurring\r\nat least in two, and for the most part in all three of the Malay countries,\r\nwhich are yet absent from Java. Most of these are large and conspicuous\r\nforms, such as jays, gapers, bee-eaters, woodpeckers, hornbills, cuckoos,\r\nparrots, pheasants, and partridges, as impossible to have remained\r\nundiscovered in Java as the large mammalia above referred to.\r\n\r\nBesides these absent _genera_ there are some curious illustrations of Javan\r\nisolation in the _species_; there being several cases in which the same\r\nspecies occurs in all three of the typical Malay countries, while in Java\r\nit is represented by an allied species. These occur chiefly among birds,\r\nthere being no less than seven species which are common to the three great\r\nMalay countries but are represented in Java by distinct though closely\r\nallied species.\r\n\r\nFrom these facts it is impossible to doubt that Java has had a history of\r\nits own, quite distinct from that of the other portions of the Malayan\r\narea. {384}\r\n\r\n_Special Relations of the Javan Fauna to that of the Asiatic\r\nContinent._--These relations are indicated by comparatively few examples,\r\nbut they are very clear and of great importance. Among mammalia, the genus\r\nHelictis is found in Java but in no other Malay country, though it inhabits\r\nalso North India; while two species, _Rhinoceros javanicus_ and _Lepus\r\nkurgosa_, are natives of Indo-Chinese countries and Java, but not of\r\ntypical Malaya. In birds there are five genera or sub-genera--Zoothera,\r\nNotodela, Crypsirhina, Allotrius, and Cochoa, which inhabit Java, the\r\nHimalayas, and Indo-China, all but the last extending south to Tenasserim,\r\nbut none of them occurring in Malacca, Sumatra, or Borneo. There are also\r\ntwo species of birds--a trogon (_Harpactes oreskios_), and the Javanese\r\npeacock (_Pavo muticus_), which inhabit only Java and the Indo-Chinese\r\ncountries, the former reaching Tenasserim and the latter Perak in the Malay\r\nPeninsula.\r\n\r\nHere, then, we find a series of remarkable similarities between Java and\r\nthe Asiatic continent, quite independent of the typical Malay\r\ncountries--Borneo, Sumatra, and the Malay Peninsula, which latter have\r\nevidently formed one connected land, and thus appear to preclude any\r\nindependent union of Java and Siam.\r\n\r\nThe great difficulty in explaining these facts is, that all the required\r\nchanges of sea and land must have occurred within the period of existing\r\nspecies of mammalia. Sumatra, Borneo, and Malacca have, as we have seen, a\r\ngreat similarity as regards their species of mammals and birds, while Java,\r\nthough it differs from them in so curious a manner, has no greater degree\r\nof speciality, since its species, when not Malayan, are almost all North\r\nIndian or Siamese.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, one consideration which may help us over this\r\ndifficulty. It seems highly probable that in the equatorial regions species\r\nhave changed less rapidly than in the north temperate zone, on account of\r\nthe equality and stability of the equatorial climate. We have seen, in\r\nChapter X., how important an agent in producing extinction and modification\r\nof species must have been the repeated changes from cold to warm, and from\r\nwarm to cold {385} conditions, with the migrations and crowding together\r\nthat must have been their necessary consequence. But in the lowlands, near\r\nthe equator, these changes would be very little if at all felt, and thus\r\none great cause of specific modification would be wanting. Let us now see\r\nwhether we can sketch out a series of not improbable changes which may have\r\nbrought about the existing relations of Java and Borneo to the continent.\r\n\r\n_Past Geographical Changes of Java and Borneo._--Although Java and Sumatra\r\nare mainly volcanic, they are by no means wholly so. Sumatra possesses in\r\nits great mountain masses ancient crystalline rocks with much granite,\r\nwhile there are extensive Tertiary deposits of Eocene age, overlying which\r\nare numerous beds of coal now raised up many thousand feet above the\r\nsea.[91] The volcanoes appear to have burst through these older mountains,\r\nand to have partly covered them as well as great areas of the lowlands with\r\nthe products of their eruptions. In Java either the fundamental strata were\r\nless extensive and less raised above the sea, or the period of volcanic\r\naction has been of longer duration; for here no crystalline rocks have been\r\nfound except a few boulders of granite in the western part of the island,\r\nperhaps the relics of a formation destroyed by denudation or covered up by\r\nvolcanic deposits. In the southern part of Java, however, there is an\r\nextensive range of low mountains, about 3,000 feet high, consisting of\r\nbasalt with limestone, apparently of Miocene age.\r\n\r\nDuring this last named period, then, Java would have been at least 3,000\r\nfeet lower than it is now, and such a depression would probably extend to\r\nconsiderable parts of Sumatra and Borneo, so as to reduce them all to a few\r\nsmall islands. At some later period a gradual elevation occurred, which\r\nultimately united the whole of the islands with the continent. This may\r\nhave continued till the glacial period of the northern hemisphere, during\r\nthe severest part of which a few Himalayan species of birds and mammals may\r\nhave been driven southward, and {386} have ranged over suitable portions of\r\nthe whole area. Java then became separated by subsidence, and these species\r\nwere imprisoned in the island; while those in the remaining part of the\r\nMalayan area again migrated northward when the cold had passed away from\r\ntheir former home, the equatorial forests of Borneo, Sumatra, and the Malay\r\nPeninsula being more especially adapted to the typical Malayan fauna which\r\nis there developed in rich profusion. A little later the subsidence may\r\nhave extended farther north, isolating Borneo and Sumatra, in which a few\r\nother Indian or Indo-Chinese forms have been retained, but probably leaving\r\nthe Malay Peninsula as a ridge between them as far as the islands of Banca\r\nand Biliton. Other slight changes of climate followed, when a further\r\nsubsidence separated these last-named islands from the Malay Peninsula, and\r\nleft them with two or three species which have since become slightly\r\nmodified. We may thus explain how it is that a species is sometimes common\r\nto Sumatra and Borneo, while the intervening island (Banca) possesses a\r\ndistinct form.[92]\r\n\r\nIn my _Geographical Distribution of Animals_, Vol. I., p. 357, I have given\r\na somewhat different hypothetical explanation of the relations of Java and\r\nBorneo to the continent, in which I took account of changes of land and sea\r\nonly; but a fuller consideration of the influence of changes of climate on\r\nthe migration of animals, has led me to the much simpler, and, I think,\r\nmore probable, explanation above given. The amount of the relationship\r\nbetween Java and Siam, as well as of that between Java and the Himalayas,\r\nis too small to be well accounted for by an independent geographical\r\nconnection in which Borneo and Sumatra did not take part. It is, at the\r\nsame time, too distinct and indisputable to be ignored; and a change of\r\nclimate which should drive a portion of the Himalayan fauna southward,\r\nleaving a few species in Java and Borneo from which they could not return\r\nowing to the subsequent isolation of those islands by subsidence, seems\r\n{387} to be a cause exactly adapted to produce the kind and amount of\r\naffinity between these distant countries that actually exists.\r\n\r\nTHE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS.\r\n\r\nA general account of the fauna of these islands, and of their biological\r\nrelations to the countries which form the subject of this chapter, has been\r\ngiven in my _Geographical Distribution of Animals_, Vol. I. pp. 345-349;\r\nbut since the publication of that work considerable additions have been\r\nmade to their fauna, having the effect of somewhat diminishing their\r\nisolation from the other islands. Four genera have been added to the\r\nterrestrial mammalia--Crocidura, Felis, Pteromys, and Mus, as well as two\r\nadditional squirrels; while the black ape (_Cynopithecus niger_) has been\r\nstruck out as not inhabiting the Philippines. This brings the true land\r\nmammalia to twenty-one species, of which fourteen are peculiar to the\r\nislands; but to these we must add no less than thirty-three species of bats\r\nof which only ten are peculiar.[93] In these estimates the Palawan {388}\r\ngroup has been omitted as these islands contain so many Bornean species\r\nthat if included they obscure the special features of the fauna.\r\n\r\n_Birds._--The late Marquis of Tweeddale made a special study of Philippine\r\nbirds, and in 1873 published a catalogue in the _Transactions of the\r\nZoological Society_ (Vol. IX. Pt. 2, pp. 125-247). But since that date\r\nlarge collections have been made by Everett, Steere, and other travellers,\r\nthe result of which has been to more than double the known species, and to\r\nrender the ornithological fauna an exceedingly rich one. Many of the\r\nMalayan genera which were thought to be absent when the first edition of\r\nthis work was published have since been discovered, among which are\r\nPhyllornis, Criniger, Diceum, Prionochilus, and Batrachostomus. But there\r\nstill remain a large number of highly characteristic Malayan genera whose\r\nabsence gives a distinctive feature to the Philippine bird fauna. Among\r\nthese are Tiga and Meiglyptes, genera of woodpeckers; Phaenicophaes and\r\nCentropus, remarkable cuckoos; the long-tailed paroquets, Palaeornis; all\r\nthe genera of Barbets except Xantholaema; the small but beautiful family\r\nEurylaemidae; many genera allied to Timalia and Ixos; the mynahs, Gracula;\r\nthe long-tailed flycatchers, Tchitrea; the fire-backed pheasants,\r\nEuplocamus; the argus pheasants, the jungle-fowl, and many others.\r\n\r\nThe following tabular statement will illustrate the rapid growth of our\r\nknowledge of the birds of the Philippines:--\r\n\r\n                                             |Land-birds.|Water-birds.|Total.\r\n                                             +-----------+------------+------\r\n  Lord Tweeddale's Catalogue (1873)          |   158     |    60      | 218\r\n  Mr. Wardlaw Ramsay's List (1881)           |   265     |    75      | 340\r\n  Mr. Everett's MSS. List of Additions (1891)|   370     |   102      | 472\r\n\r\nThe number of peculiar species is very large, there being about 300 land\r\nand forty-two water birds, which are not {389} known to occur beyond the\r\ngroup. We have here, still more pronounced than in the case of Borneo, the\r\nremarkable fact of the true land birds presenting a larger amount of\r\nspeciality than the land mammals; for while more than four-fifths of the\r\nbirds are peculiar, only a little more than half the mammals are so, and if\r\nwe exclude the bats only two-thirds.\r\n\r\nThe general character of the fauna of this group of islands is evidently\r\nthe result of their physical conditions and geological history. The\r\nPhilippines are almost surrounded by deep sea, but are connected with\r\nBorneo by means of two narrow submarine banks, on the northern of which is\r\nsituated Palawan, and on the southern the Sulu Islands. Two small groups of\r\nislands, the Bashees and Babuyanes, have also afforded a partial connection\r\nwith the continent by way of Formosa. It is evident that the Philippines\r\nonce formed part of the great Malayan extension of Asia, but that they were\r\nseparated considerably earlier than Java; and having been since greatly\r\nisolated and much broken up by volcanic disturbances, their species have\r\nfor the most part become modified into distinct local forms, representative\r\nspecies often occurring in the different islands of the group. They have\r\nalso received a few Chinese types by the route already indicated, and a few\r\nAustralian forms owing to their proximity to the Moluccas. Their\r\ncomparative poverty in genera and species of the mammalia is perhaps due to\r\nthe fact that they have been subjected to a great amount of submersion in\r\nrecent times, greatly reducing their area and causing the extinction of a\r\nconsiderable portion of their fauna. This is not a mere hypothesis, but is\r\nsupported by direct evidence; for I am informed by Mr. Everett, who has\r\nmade extensive explorations in the islands, that almost everywhere are\r\nfound large tracts of elevated coral-reefs, containing shells similar to\r\nthose living in the adjacent seas, an indisputable proof of recent\r\nelevation.\r\n\r\n_Concluding Remarks on the Malay Islands._--This completes our sketch of\r\nthe great Malay islands, the seat of the typical Malayan fauna. It has been\r\nshown that the peculiarities presented by the individual islands may be all\r\n{390} sufficiently well explained by a very simple and comparatively\r\nunimportant series of geographical changes, combined with a limited amount\r\nof change of climate towards the northern tropic. Beginning in late Miocene\r\ntimes when the deposits on the south coast of Java were upraised, we\r\nsuppose a general elevation of the whole of the extremely shallow seas\r\nuniting what are now Sumatra, Java, Borneo, and the Philippines with the\r\nAsiatic continent, and forming that extended equatorial area in which the\r\ntypical Malayan fauna was developed. After a long period of stability,\r\ngiving ample time for the specialisation of so many peculiar types, the\r\nPhilippines were first separated; then at a considerably later period Java;\r\na little later Sumatra and Borneo; and finally the islands south of\r\nSingapore to Banca and Biliton. This one simple series of elevations and\r\nsubsidences, combined with the changes of climate already referred to, and\r\nsuch local elevations and depressions as must undoubtedly have occurred,\r\nappears sufficient to have brought about the curious, and at first sight\r\npuzzling, relations, of the faunas of Java and the Philippines, as compared\r\nwith those of the larger islands.\r\n\r\nWe will now pass on to the consideration of two other groups which offer\r\nfeatures of special interest, and which will complete our illustrative\r\nsurvey of recent continental islands.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{391}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nJAPAN AND FORMOSA\r\n\r\n    Japan, its Position and Physical Features--Zoological Features of\r\n    Japan--Mammalia--Birds--Birds Common to Great Britain and Japan--Birds\r\n    Peculiar to Japan--Japan Birds Recurring in Distant\r\n    Areas--Formosa--Physical Features of Formosa--Animal Life of\r\n    Formosa--Mammalia--Land-birds Peculiar to Formosa--Formosan Birds\r\n    Recurring in India or Malaya--Comparison of Faunas of Hainan, Formosa,\r\n    and Japan--General Remarks on Recent Continental Islands.\r\n\r\nJAPAN.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese Islands occupy a very similar position on the eastern shore of\r\nthe great Euro-Asiatic continent to that of the British Islands on the\r\nwestern, except that they are about sixteen degrees further south, and\r\nhaving a greater extension in latitude enjoy a more varied as well as a\r\nmore temperate climate. Their outline is also much more irregular and their\r\nmountains loftier, the volcanic peak of Fusiyama being 14,177 feet high;\r\nwhile their geological structure is very complex, their soil extremely\r\nfertile, and their vegetation in the highest degree varied and beautiful.\r\nLike our own islands, too, they are connected with the continent by a\r\nmarine bank less than a hundred fathoms below the surface--at all events\r\ntowards the north and south; but in the intervening space the Sea of Japan\r\nopens out to a width of six hundred miles, and in its central portion is\r\nvery deep, and this may be an indication that the connection between the\r\nislands and the continent is of rather ancient date. At the Straits of\r\nCorea the distance from the main land is about 120 miles, while at the\r\nnorthern extremity of Yesso it is about 200. The island of Saghalien,\r\nhowever, separated from Yesso by a strait only twenty-five miles wide,\r\nforms a connection with Amoorland in about 52deg N. Lat. A southern warm\r\ncurrent flowing a little to the eastward of the islands, ameliorates their\r\nclimate much in the same way as the Gulf Stream does ours, and added to\r\ntheir insular position enables them to support a more tropical vegetation\r\nand more varied forms of life than are found at corresponding latitudes in\r\nChina.\r\n\r\n{392}\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP OF JAPAN AND FORMOSA (with depths in fathoms).\r\n\r\nLight tint, sea under 100 fathoms.

The figures show the depth in fathoms.]\r\n\r\n{393}\r\n\r\n_Zoological Features of Japan._--As we might expect from the conditions\r\nhere sketched out, Japan exhibits in all its forms of animal life a close\r\ngeneral resemblance to the adjacent continent, but with a considerable\r\nelement of specific individuality; while it also possesses some remarkable\r\nisolated groups. Its fauna presents indications of there having been two or\r\nmore lines of migration at different epochs. The majority of its animals\r\nare related to those of the temperate or cold regions of the continent,\r\neither as identical or allied species; but a smaller number have a tropical\r\ncharacter, and these have in several instances no allies in China but occur\r\nagain only in Northern India or the Malay Archipelago. There is also a\r\nslight American element in the fauna of Japan, a relic probably of the\r\nperiod when a land communication existed between the two continents over\r\nwhat are now the shallow seas of Japan, Ochotsk, and Kamschatka. We will\r\nnow proceed to examine the peculiarities and relations of the fauna.\r\n\r\n_Mammalia._--The mammalia of Japan at present known are forty in number;\r\nnot very many when compared with the rich fauna of China and Manchuria, but\r\ncontaining monkeys, bears, deer, wild goats and wild boars, as well as\r\nfoxes, badgers, moles, squirrels, and hares, so that there can be no doubt\r\nwhatever that they imply a land connection with the continent. No complete\r\naccount of Japan mammals has been given by any competent zoologist since\r\nthe publication of Von Siebold's _Fauna Japonica_ in 1844, {394} but by\r\ncollecting together most of the scattered observations since that period\r\nthe following list has been drawn up, and will, it is hoped, be of use to\r\nnaturalists. The species believed to be peculiar to Japan are printed in\r\nitalics. These are very numerous, but it must be remembered that Corea and\r\nManchuria (the portions of the continent opposite Japan) are comparatively\r\nlittle known, while in very few cases have the species of Japan and of the\r\ncontinent been critically compared. Where this has been done, however, the\r\npeculiar species established by the older naturalists have been in many\r\ncases found to be correct.\r\n\r\nLIST OF THE MAMMALIA OF THE JAPANESE ISLANDS.\r\n\r\n    1. _Macacus speciosus._ A monkey with rudimentary tail and red face,\r\n    allied to the Barbary ape. It inhabits the island of Niphon up to 41deg\r\n    N. Lat., and has thus the most northern range of any living monkey.\r\n\r\n    2. _Pteropus dasymallus._ A peculiar fruit-bat, found in Kiusiu Island\r\n    only (Lat. 33deg N.), and thus ranging further north of the equator\r\n    than any other species of the genus.\r\n\r\n    3. Rhinolophus ferrum-equinum. The great horse-shoe bat, ranges from\r\n    Britain across Europe and temperate Asia to Japan. It is the _R.\r\n    nippon_ of the Fauna Japonica according to Mr. Dobson's _Monograph of\r\n    Asiatic Bats_.\r\n\r\n    4. R. minor. Found also in Burma, Yunan, Java, Borneo, &c.\r\n\r\n    5. Vesperugo pipistrellus. From Britain across Europe and Asia.\r\n\r\n    6. V. abramus. Also in India and China.\r\n\r\n    7. V. noctula. From Britain across Europe and Asia.\r\n\r\n     8. V. molossus. Also in China.\r\n\r\n    9. Vespertilio capaccinii. Philippine Islands, and Italy! This is _V.\r\n    macrodactylus_ of the Fauna Japonica according to Mr. Dobson.\r\n\r\n    10. Miniopterus schreibersii. Philippines, Burma, Malay Islands. This\r\n    is _Vespertilio blepotis_ of the Fauna Japonica.\r\n\r\n    11. _Talpa wogura._ Closely resembles the common mole of Europe, but\r\n    has six incisors instead of eight in the lower jaw.\r\n\r\n    12. _Talpa mizura._ Guenth. Allied to _T. wogura_.\r\n\r\n    13. _Urotrichus talpoides._ A peculiar genus of moles confined to\r\n    Japan. An American species has been named _Urotrichus gibsii_, and Mr.\r\n    Lord after comparing the two says that he \"can find no difference\r\n    whatever, either generic or specific. In shape, size, and colour, they\r\n    are exactly alike.\" But Dr. Guenther (_P. Z. S._ 1880, p. 441) states\r\n    that _U. gibsii_ differs so much in dentition from the Japanese species\r\n    that it should be placed in a distinct genus, which he calls\r\n    Neurotrichus.\r\n\r\n    14. Sorex myosurus. A shrew, found also in India and Malaya.\r\n\r\n    15. _Sorex dzi-nezumi._\r\n\r\n    16. _S. umbrinus._\r\n\r\n    17. _S. platycephalus._ {395}\r\n\r\n    18. Ursus arctos. var. A peculiar variety of the European brown bear\r\n    which inhabits also Amoorland and Kamschatka. It is the _Ursus ferox_\r\n    of the Fauna Japonica.\r\n\r\n    19. _Ursus japonicus._ A peculiar species allied to the Himalayan and\r\n    Formosan species. Named _U. tibetanus_ in the Fauna Japonica.\r\n\r\n    20. _Meles anakuma._ Differs from the European and Siberian badgers in\r\n    the form of the skull.\r\n\r\n    21. _Mustela brachyura._ A peculiar martin found also in the Kurile\r\n    Islands.\r\n\r\n    22. _Mustela melanopus._ The Japanese sable.\r\n\r\n    23. _M. Japonica._ A peculiar martin (See _Proc. Zool. Soc._ 1865, p.\r\n    104).\r\n\r\n    24. _M. Sibericus._ Also Siberia and China. This is the _M. italsi_ of\r\n    the Fauna Japonica according to Dr. Gray.\r\n\r\n    25. _Lutronectes whiteleyi._ A new genus and species of otter\r\n    (_P. Z. S._ 1867, p. 180). In the Fauna Japonica named _Lutra\r\n    vulgaris_.\r\n\r\n    26. Enhydris marina. The sea-otter of California and Kamschatka.\r\n\r\n    27. _Canis hodophylax._ According to Dr. Gray allied to _Cuon\r\n    sumatranus_ of the Malay Islands, and _C. alpinus_ of Siberia, if not\r\n    identical with one of them (_P. Z. S._ 1868, p. 500).\r\n\r\n    28. _Vulpes japonica._ A peculiar fox. _Canis vulpes_ of Fauna\r\n    Japonica.\r\n\r\n    29. Nyctereutes procyonoides. The racoon-dog of N. China and Amoorland.\r\n\r\n    30. _Lepus brachyurus._ A peculiar hare.\r\n\r\n    31. _Sciurus lis._ A peculiar squirrel.\r\n\r\n    32. _Pteromys leucogenys._ The white-cheeked flying squirrel.\r\n\r\n    33. _P. momoga._ Perhaps identical with a Cambojan species (_P. Z. S._\r\n    1861, p. 137).\r\n\r\n    34. _Myoxus japonicus._ A peculiar dormouse. _M. elegans_ of the Fauna\r\n    Japonica; _M. javanicus_, Schinz (_Synopsis Mammalium_, ii. p. 530).\r\n\r\n    35. _Mus argenteus._ China.\r\n\r\n    36. _Mus molossinus._\r\n\r\n    37. _M. nezumi._\r\n\r\n    38. _M. speciosus._\r\n\r\n    39. _Cervus sika._ A peculiar deer allied to _C. pseudaxis_ of Formosa\r\n    and _C. mantchuricus_ of Northern China.\r\n\r\n    40. _Nemorhedus crispa._ A goat-like antelope allied to _N. sumatranus_\r\n    of Sumatra, and _N. Swinhoei_ of Formosa.\r\n\r\n    41. _Sus leucomystax._ A wild boar allied to _S. taeranus_ of Formosa.\r\n\r\nWe thus find that no less than twenty-six out of the forty-one Japanese\r\nmammals are peculiar, and if we omit the aerial bats (nine in number), as\r\nwell as the marine sea-otter, we shall have remaining only thirty strictly\r\nland mammalia, of which twenty-five are peculiar, or five-sixths of the\r\nwhole. Nor does this represent all their speciality; for we have a mole\r\ndiffering in its dentition from the European mole; another superficially\r\nresembling but quite distinct from an American species; a peculiar genus of\r\notters; and an antelope whose nearest allies are in Formosa and Sumatra.\r\nThe importance of these facts will {396} be best understood when we have\r\nexamined the corresponding affinities of the birds of Japan.\r\n\r\n_Birds._--Owing to the recent researches of some English residents we have\r\nprobably a fuller knowledge of the birds than of the mammalia; yet the\r\nnumber of true land-birds ascertained to inhabit the islands either as\r\nresidents or migrants is only 200, which is less than might be expected\r\nconsidering the highly favourable conditions of mild climate, luxuriant\r\nvegetation, and abundance of insect-life, and the extreme riches of the\r\nadjacent continent,--Mr. Swinhoe's list of the birds of China containing\r\nmore than 400 land species, after deducting all which are peculiar to the\r\nadjacent islands. Only seventeen species, or about one-twelfth of the\r\nwhole, are now considered to be peculiar to Japan proper; while seventeen\r\nmore are peculiar to the various outlying small islands constituting the\r\nBonin and Loo Choo groups. Even of these, six or seven are classed by Mr.\r\nSeebohm as probably sub-species or slightly modified forms of continental\r\nbirds, so that ten only are well-marked species, undoubtedly distinct from\r\nthose of any other country.\r\n\r\nThe great majority of the birds are decidedly temperate forms identical\r\nwith those of Northern Asia and Europe; while no less than forty of the\r\nspecies of land-birds are also found in Britain, or are such slight\r\nmodifications of British species that the difference is only perceptible to\r\na trained ornithologist. The following list of the land-birds common to\r\nBritain and Japan is very interesting, when we consider that these\r\ncountries are separated by the whole extent of the European and Asiatic\r\ncontinents, or by almost exactly one-fourth of the circumference of the\r\nglobe:--\r\n\r\nLAND BIRDS COMMON TO GREAT BRITAIN AND JAPAN.[94]\r\n\r\n(_Either Identical Species or Representative sub-species._)\r\n\r\n   1.

There remains,\r\nhowever, a considerable body of Chinese and Siberian species, which link\r\nthe islands to the neighbouring parts of the continent; and there are also\r\na few which are Malayan or Himalayan rather than Chinese, and thus afford\r\nus an interesting problem in distribution.\r\n\r\nThe seventeen species and sub-species which are altogether peculiar to\r\nJapan proper, are for the most part allied to birds of North China and\r\nSiberia, but three are decidedly tropical, and one of them--a fruit pigeon\r\n(_Treron sieboldi_)--has no close ally nearer than Burmah and the\r\nHimalayas. In the following list the affinities of the species are\r\nindicated wherever they have been ascertained:--\r\n\r\nLIST OF THE SPECIES OF LAND BIRDS PECULIAR TO JAPAN.\r\n\r\n    1. _Accentor rubidus._ Nearly allied to our hedge-sparrow, and less\r\n    closely to the Central Asian _A. immaculatus._\r\n\r\n    (1a. _Hypsipetes amaurotis._ Migrates to the Corea, otherwise\r\n    peculiar.)\r\n\r\n    2. _Zosterops japonica._ Allied to two Chinese species.\r\n\r\n    3. _Lusciniola pryeri._\r\n\r\n    4. _Garrulus japonicus._ Allied to the Siberian and British Jays.\r\n\r\n    5. _Fringilla kawarahiba._ Allied to the Chinese greenfinch.\r\n\r\n    6. _Emberiza ciopsis._ Allied to the E. Siberian bunting _E. cioides_,\r\n    of which it may be considered a sub-species.\r\n\r\n    7.     ,,   _yessoensis._ A distinct species.\r\n\r\n    8.     ,,   _personata._ A sub-species of _E. spodocephala._\r\n\r\n    9. _Gecinus awokera._ A distinct species of green woodpecker.\r\n\r\n    10. _Picus namiyei._ Allied to a Formosan species.\r\n\r\n    11. _Treron sieboldi._ Allied to _T. sphenura_ of the Himalayas, and to\r\n    a Formosan species.\r\n\r\n    12. _Carpophaga ianthina._ A distinct species of fruit-pigeon.\r\n\r\n    13. _Bubo blakistoni._ Allied to a Philippine eagle-owl.\r\n\r\n    14. _Scops semitorgues._ A distinct species.\r\n\r\n    15. _Phasianus versicolor._ A distinct species.\r\n\r\n    16.     ,,    _soemmeringi._ A distinct species.\r\n\r\n    17.     ,,    _scintillaus._ A sub-species of the last.\r\n\r\nThe large number of seventeen peculiar species in the outlying Bonin and\r\nLoo Choo Islands is an interesting feature of Japanese ornithology. The\r\ncomparative remoteness of {399} these islands, their mild sub-tropical\r\nclimate and luxuriant vegetation, and perhaps the absence of violent storms\r\nand their being situated out of the line of continental migration, seem to\r\nbe the conditions that have favoured the specialisation of modified types\r\nadapted to the new environment.\r\n\r\n_Japan Birds Recurring in Distant Areas._--The most interesting feature in\r\nthe ornithology of Japan is, undoubtedly, the presence of several species\r\nwhich indicate an alliance with such remote districts as the Himalayas, the\r\nMalay Islands, and Europe. Among the peculiar species, the most remarkable\r\nof this class are,--the fruit-pigeon of the genus Treron, entirely unknown\r\nin China, but reappearing in Formosa and Japan; the Hypsipetes, whose\r\nnearest ally is in South China at a distance of nearly 500 miles; and the\r\njay (_Garrulus japonicus_), whose near ally (_G. glandarius_) inhabits\r\nEurope only, at a distance of 3,700 miles. But even more extraordinary are\r\nthe following non-peculiar species:--_Spizaetus orientalis_, a crested\r\neagle, inhabiting the Himalayas, Formosa, and Japan, but unknown in\r\nSouthern or Eastern China; _Ceryle guttata_, a spotted kingfisher, almost\r\nconfined to the Himalayas and Japan, though occurring rarely in Central\r\nChina; and _Halcyon coromanda_, a brilliant red kingfisher inhabiting\r\nNorthern India, the Malay Islands to Celebes, Formosa, and Japan. We have\r\nhere an excellent illustration of the favourable conditions which islands\r\nafford both for species which elsewhere live further south (_Halcyon\r\ncoromanda_), and for the preservation in isolated colonies of species which\r\nare verging towards extinction; for such we must consider the above-named\r\neagle and kingfisher, both confined to a very limited area on the\r\ncontinent, but surviving in remote islands. Referring to our account of the\r\nbirth, growth, and death of a species (in Chapter IV.) it can hardly be\r\ndoubted that the _Ceryle guttata_ formerly ranged from the Himalayas to\r\nJapan, and has now almost died out in the intervening area owing to\r\ngeographical and physical changes, a subject which will be better discussed\r\nwhen we have examined the interesting fauna of the island of Formosa. {400}\r\n\r\nThe other orders of animals are not yet sufficiently known to enable us to\r\nfound any accurate conclusions upon them. The main facts of their\r\ndistribution have already been given in my _Geographical Distribution of\r\nAnimals_ (Vol I., pp. 227-231), and they sufficiently agree with the birds\r\nand mammalia in showing a mixture of temperate and tropical forms with a\r\nconsiderable proportion of peculiar species. Owing to the comparatively\r\neasy passage from the northern extremity of Japan through the island of\r\nSaghalien to the mainland of Asia, a large number of temperate forms of\r\ninsects and birds are still able to enter the country, and thus diminish\r\nthe proportionate number of peculiar species. In the case of mammals this\r\nis more difficult; and the large proportion of specific difference in their\r\ncase is a good indication of the comparatively remote epoch at which Japan\r\nwas finally separated from the continent. How long ago this separation took\r\nplace we cannot of course tell, but we may be sure it was much longer than\r\nin the case of our own islands, and therefore probably in the earlier\r\nportion of the Pliocene period.\r\n\r\nFORMOSA.\r\n\r\nAmong recent continental islands there is probably none that surpasses in\r\ninterest and instructiveness the Chinese island named by the Portuguese,\r\nFormosa, or \"The Beautiful.\" Till quite recently it was a _terra incognita_\r\nto naturalists, and we owe almost all our present knowledge of it to a\r\nsingle man, the late Mr. Robert Swinhoe, who, in his official capacity as\r\none of our consuls in China, visited it several times between 1856 and\r\n1866, besides residing on it for more than a year. During this period he\r\ndevoted all his spare time and energy to the study of natural history, more\r\nespecially of the two important groups, birds and mammals; and by employing\r\na large staff of native collectors and hunters, he obtained a very complete\r\nknowledge of its fauna. In this case, too, we have the great advantage of a\r\nvery thorough knowledge of the adjacent parts of the continent, in great\r\npart due to Mr. Swinhoe's own exertions during the twenty years of his\r\nservice in {401} that country. We possess, too, the further advantage of\r\nhaving the whole of the available materials in these two classes collected\r\ntogether by Mr. Swinhoe himself after full examination and comparison of\r\nspecimens; so that there is probably no part of the world (if we except\r\nEurope, North America, and British India) of whose warm-blooded vertebrates\r\nwe possess fuller or more accurate knowledge than we do of those of the\r\ncoast districts of China and its islands.[95]\r\n\r\n_Physical Features of Formosa._--The island of Formosa is nearly half the\r\nsize of Ireland, being 220 miles long, and from twenty to eighty miles\r\nwide. It is traversed down its centre by a fine mountain range, which\r\nreaches an altitude of about 8,000 feet in the south and 12,000 feet in the\r\nnorthern half of the island, and whose higher slopes and valleys are\r\neverywhere clothed with magnificent forests. It is crossed by the line of\r\nthe Tropic of Cancer a little south of its centre; and this position,\r\ncombined with its lofty mountains, gives it an unusual variety of tropical\r\nand temperate climates. These circumstances are all highly favourable to\r\nthe preservation and development of animal life, and from what we already\r\nknow of its productions, it seems probable that few, if any islands of\r\napproximately the same size and equally removed from a continent will be\r\nfound to equal it in the number and variety of their higher animals. The\r\noutline map (at page 392) shows that Formosa is connected with the mainland\r\nby a submerged bank, the hundred-fathom line including it along with Hainan\r\nto the south-west and Japan on the north-east; while the line of\r\ntwo-hundred fathoms includes also the Madjico-Sima and Loo-Choo Islands,\r\nand may, perhaps, mark out approximately the last great extension of the\r\nAsiatic continent, the submergence of which isolated these islands from the\r\nmainland.\r\n\r\n_Animal Life of Formosa._--We are at present acquainted {402} with 35\r\nspecies of mammalia, and 128 species of land-birds from Formosa, fourteen\r\nof the former and forty-three of the latter being peculiar, while the\r\nremainder inhabit also some part of the continent or adjacent islands. This\r\nproportion of peculiar species is perhaps (as regards the birds) the\r\nhighest to be met with in any island which can be classed as both\r\ncontinental and recent, and this, in all probability, implies that the\r\nepoch of separation is somewhat remote. It was not, however, remote enough\r\nto reach back to a time when the continental fauna was very different from\r\nwhat it is now, for we find all the chief types of living Asiatic mammalia\r\nrepresented in this small island. Thus we have monkeys; insectivora;\r\nnumerous carnivora; pigs, deer, antelopes, and cattle among ungulata;\r\nnumerous rodents, and the edentate Manis,--a very fair representation of\r\nAsiatic mammals, all being of known genera, and of species either\r\nabsolutely identical with some still living elsewhere or very closely\r\nallied to them. The birds exhibit analogous phenomena, with the exception\r\nthat we have here two peculiar and very interesting genera.\r\n\r\nBut besides the amount of specific and generic modification that has\r\noccurred, we have another indication of the lapse of time in the peculiar\r\nrelations of a large proportion of the Formosan animals, which show that a\r\ngreat change in the distribution of Asiatic species must have taken place\r\nsince the separation of the island from the continent. Before pointing\r\nthese out it will be advantageous to give lists of the mammalia and\r\npeculiar birds of the island, as we shall have frequent occasion to refer\r\nto them.\r\n\r\nLIST OF THE MAMMALIA OF FORMOSA. (The peculiar species are printed in\r\nitalics.)\r\n\r\n     1. _Macacus cyclopis._ A rock-monkey more allied to _M. rhesus_ of\r\n    India    than to _M. sancti-johannis_ of South China.\r\n     2. _Pteropus formosus._ A fruit-bat closely allied to the Japanese\r\n    species.    None of the genus are found in China.\r\n     3. Vesperugo abramus. China.\r\n     4. Vespertilio formosus. Black and orange Bat. China.\r\n     5. Nyctinomus cestonii. Large-eared Bat. China, S.

The clouded Tiger of Siam and Malaya.\r\n    14. Felis viverrina. The Asiatic wild Cat. Himalayas and Malacca.\r\n    15. Felis chinensis. The Chinese Tiger Cat. China.\r\n    16. Viverricula malaccensis. Spotted Civet. China, India.\r\n    17. Paguma larvata. Gem-faced Civet. China.\r\n    18. _Sus taivanus._ Allied to the wild Pig of Japan.\r\n    19. Cervulus reevesii. Reeve's Muntjac. China.\r\n    20. _Cervus pseudaxis._ Formosan Spotted Deer. Allied to _C. sika_ of\r\n    Japan.\r\n    21. _Cervus swinhoii._ Swinhoe's Rusa Deer. Allied to Indian and\r\n    Malayan species.\r\n    22. _Nemorhedus swinhoii._ Swinhoe's Goat-antelope. Allied to the\r\n    species of Sumatra and Japan.\r\n    23. Bos chinensis. South China wild Cow.\r\n    24. Mus bandicota. The Bandicoot Rat. Perhaps introduced from India.\r\n    25. Mus indicus. Indian Rat.\r\n    26. _Mus coxinga._ Spinous Country-rat.\r\n    27. _Mus canna._ Silken Country-rat.\r\n    28. _Mus losca_. Brown Country-rat.\r\n    29. Sciurus castaneoventris. Chestnut-bellied Squirrel. China and\r\n    Hainan.\r\n    30. Sciurus m'clellandi. McClelland's Squirrel. Himalayas, China.\r\n    31. _Sciuropterus kaleensis._ Small Formosan Flying Squirrel. Allied to\r\n    _S. alboniger_ of Nepal.\r\n    32. _Pteromys grandis._ Large Red Flying Squirrel. Allied to Himalayan\r\n    and Bornean species. From North Formosa.\r\n    33. _Pteromys pectoralis._ White-breasted Flying Squirrel. From South\r\n    Formosa.\r\n    34. Lepus sinensis. Chinese Hare. Inhabits South China.\r\n    35. Manis dalmanni. Scaly Ant-eater. China and the Himalayas.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting and suggestive feature connected with these Formosan\r\nmammals is the identity or affinity of several of them, with Indian or\r\nMalayan rather than with Chinese species. We have the rock-monkey of\r\nFormosa allied to the rhesus monkeys of India and Burma, not to those of\r\nSouth China and Hainan. The tree civet (_Helictis subaurantiaca_), and the\r\nsmall flying squirrel (_Sciuropterus kaleensis_), are both allied to\r\nHimalayan species. Swinhoe's deer and goat-antelope are nearest to Malayan\r\nspecies, as are the red and white-breasted flying squirrels; while the\r\nfruit-bat, the wild pig, {404} and the spotted deer are all allied to\r\npeculiar Japanese species. The clouded tiger is a Malay species unknown in\r\nChina, while the Asiatic wild cat is a native of the Himalayas and Malacca.\r\nIt is clear, therefore, that before Formosa was separated from the mainland\r\nthe above named animals or their ancestral types must have ranged over the\r\nintervening country as far as the Himalayas on the west, Japan on the\r\nnorth, and Borneo or the Philippines on the south; and that after that\r\nevent occurred, the conditions were so materially changed as to lead to the\r\nextinction of these species in what are now the coast provinces of China,\r\nwhile they or their modified descendants continued to exist in the dense\r\nforests of the Himalayas and the Malay Islands, and in such detached\r\nislands as Formosa and Japan. We will now see what additional light is\r\nthrown upon this subject by an examination of the birds.\r\n\r\nLIST OF THE LAND BIRDS PECULIAR TO FORMOSA.\r\n\r\n    TURDIDAE (Thrushes).\r\n\r\n    1. _Turdus albiceps._ Allied to Chinese species.\r\n\r\n    SYLVIDIAE (Warblers).\r\n\r\n    2. _Cisticola volitans._ Allied to _C. schoenicola_ of India and\r\n    China.\r\n    3. _Herbivox cantans._ Sub-species of _H. cantillaus_ of N.

Fourteen species have\r\nHimalayan allies, and six of these belong to genera which are unknown in\r\nChina. One has its nearest ally in the Nilgherries, and five in the Malay\r\nIslands; and of these six, four belong to genera which are not Chinese. Two\r\nhave their only near allies in Japan. Perhaps more curious still are those\r\ncases in which, though the genus is Chinese, the nearest allied species is\r\nto be sought for in some remote region. Thus we have the Formosan babbler\r\n(_Garrulax ruficeps_) not allied to the species found in South China, but\r\nto one inhabiting North India and East Thibet; while the black bulbul\r\n(_Hypsipetes nigerrimus_), is not allied to the Chinese species but to an\r\nAssamese form.\r\n\r\nIn the same category as the above we must place eight species not peculiar\r\nto Formosa, but which are Indian or Malayan rather than Chinese, so that\r\nthey offer examples of discontinuous distribution somewhat analogous to\r\nwhat {407} we found to occur in Japan. These are enumerated in the\r\nfollowing list.\r\n\r\nSPECIES OF BIRDS COMMON TO FORMOSA AND INDIA OR MALAYA, BUT NOT FOUND IN\r\nCHINA.\r\n\r\n1. _Siphia superciliaris._ The Rufous-breasted Flycatcher of the S. E.\r\nHimalayas.\r\n\r\n2. _Halcyon coromanda._ The Great Red Kingfisher of India, Malaya, and\r\nJapan.\r\n\r\n3. _Palumbus pulchricollis._ The Darjeeling Wood-pigeon of the S. E.\r\nHimalayas.\r\n\r\n4. _Turnix dussumieri._ The larger Button-quail of India.\r\n\r\n5. _Spizaetus nipalensis._ The Spotted Hawk-eagle of Nepal and Assam.\r\n\r\n6. _Lophospiza trivirgata._ The Crested Gos-hawk of the Malay Islands.\r\n\r\n7. _Bulaca newarensis._ The Brown Wood-owl of the Himalayas.\r\n\r\n8. _Strix candida._ The Grass-owl of India and Malaya.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting of the above are the pigeon and the flycatcher, both\r\nof which are, so far as yet known, strictly confined to the Himalayan\r\nmountains and Formosa. They thus afford examples of discontinuous specific\r\ndistribution exactly parallel to that of the great spotted kingfisher,\r\nalready referred to as found only in the Himalayas and Japan.\r\n\r\n_Comparison of the Faunas of Hainan, Formosa, and Japan._--The island of\r\nHainan on the extreme south of China, and only separated from the mainland\r\nby a strait fifteen miles wide, appears to have considerable similarity to\r\nFormosa, inasmuch as it possesses seventeen peculiar land-birds (out of 130\r\nobtained by Mr. Swinhoe), two of which are close allies of Formosan\r\nspecies, while two others are identical. We also find four species whose\r\nnearest allies are in the Himalayas. Our knowledge of this island and of\r\nthe adjacent coast of China is not yet sufficient to enable us to form an\r\naccurate judgment of its relations, but it seems probable that it was\r\nseparated from the continent at, approximately, the same epoch as Formosa\r\nand Japan, and that the special features of each of these islands are\r\nmainly due to their geographical position. Formosa, being more completely\r\nisolated than either of the others, possesses a larger proportion of\r\npeculiar species of birds, while its tropical situation and lofty mountain\r\nranges {408} have enabled it to preserve an unusual number of Himalayan and\r\nMalayan forms. Japan, almost equally isolated towards the south, and having\r\na much greater variety of climate as well as a much larger area, possesses\r\nabout an equal number of mammalia with Formosa, and an even larger\r\nproportion of peculiar species. Its birds, however, though more numerous\r\nare less peculiar; and this is probably due to the large number of species\r\nwhich migrate northwards in summer, and find it easy to enter Japan through\r\nthe Kurile Isles or Saghalien.[96] Japan too, is largely peopled by those\r\nnorthern types which have an unusually wide range, and which, being almost\r\nall migratory, are accustomed to cross over seas of moderate extent. The\r\nregular or occasional influx of these species prevents the formation of\r\nspecial insular races, such as are almost always produced when a portion of\r\nthe population of a species remains for a considerable time completely\r\nisolated. We thus have explained the curious fact, that while the mammalia\r\nof the two islands are almost equally peculiar, (those of Japan being most\r\nso in the present state of our knowledge), the birds of Formosa show a far\r\ngreater number of peculiar species than those of Japan.\r\n\r\n_General Remarks on Recent Continental Islands._--We have now briefly\r\nsketched the zoological peculiarities of an illustrative series of recent\r\ncontinental islands, commencing with one of the most recent--Great\r\nBritain--in which the process of formation of peculiar species has only\r\njust commenced, and terminating with Formosa, probably one of the most\r\nancient of the series, and which accordingly presents us with a very large\r\nproportion of peculiar species, not only in its mammalia, which have no\r\nmeans of crossing the wide strait which separates it from the mainland, but\r\nalso in its birds, many of which are quite able to cross over.\r\n\r\nHere, too, we obtain a glimpse of the way in which {409} species die out\r\nand are replaced by others, which quite agrees with what the theory of\r\nevolution assures us must have occurred. On a continent, the process of\r\nextinction will generally take effect on the circumference of the area of\r\ndistribution, because it is there that the species comes into contact with\r\nsuch adverse conditions or competing forms as prevent it from advancing\r\nfurther. A very slight change will evidently turn the scale and cause the\r\nspecies to contract its range, and this usually goes on till it is reduced\r\nto a very restricted area, and finally becomes extinct. It may conceivably\r\nhappen (and almost certainly has sometimes happened) that the process of\r\nrestriction of range by adverse conditions may act in one direction only,\r\nand over a limited district, so as ultimately to divide the specific area\r\ninto two separated parts, in each of which a portion of the species will\r\ncontinue to maintain itself. We have seen that there is reason to believe\r\nthat this has occurred in a very few cases both in North America and in\r\nNorthern Asia. (_See_ pp. 65-68.) But the same thing has certainly occurred\r\nin a considerable number of cases, only it has resulted in the divided\r\nareas being occupied by _representative forms_ instead of by the very same\r\nspecies. The cause of this is very easy to understand. We have already\r\nshown that there is a large amount of local variation in a considerable\r\nnumber of species, and we may be sure that were it not for the constant\r\nintermingling and intercrossing of the individuals inhabiting adjacent\r\nlocalities this tendency to local variation in adaptation to slightly\r\ndifferent conditions, would soon form distinct races. But as soon as the\r\narea is divided into two portions the intercrossing is stopped, and the\r\nusual result is that two closely allied races, classed as representative\r\nspecies, become formed. Such pairs of allied species on the two sides of a\r\ncontinent, or in two detached areas, are very numerous; and their existence\r\nis only explicable on the supposition that they are descendants of a parent\r\nform which once occupied an area comprising that of both of them,--that\r\nthis area then became discontinuous,--and, lastly, that, as a consequence\r\nof the discontinuity, the two sections of the parent species became\r\nsegregated into distinct races or new species. {410}\r\n\r\nNow, when the division of the area leaves one portion of the species in an\r\nisland, a similar modification of the species, either in the island or in\r\nthe continent, occurs, resulting in closely-allied but distinct forms; and\r\nsuch forms are, as we have seen, highly characteristic of island-faunas.\r\nBut islands also favour the occasional preservation of the unchanged\r\nspecies--a phenomenon which very rarely occurs in continents. This is\r\nprobably due to the absence of competition in islands, so that the parent\r\nspecies there maintains itself unchanged, while the continental portion, by\r\nthe force of that competition, is driven back to some remote mountain area,\r\nwhere it also obtains a comparative freedom from competition. Thus may be\r\nexplained the curious fact, that the species common to Formosa and India\r\nare generally confined to limited areas in the Himalayas, or in other cases\r\nare found only in remote islands, as Japan or Hainan.\r\n\r\nThe distribution and affinities of the animals of continental islands thus\r\nthrows much light on that obscure subject--the decay and extinction of\r\nspecies; while the numerous and delicate gradations in the modification of\r\nthe continental species, from perfect identity, through slight varieties,\r\nlocal forms, and insular races, to well-defined species and even distinct\r\ngenera, afford an overwhelming mass of evidence in favour of the theory of\r\n\"descent with modification.\"\r\n\r\nWe shall now pass on to another class of islands, which, though originally\r\nforming parts of continents, were separated from them at very remote\r\nepochs. This antiquity is clearly manifested in their existing faunas,\r\nwhich present many peculiarities, and offer some most curious problems to\r\nthe student of distribution.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{411}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nANCIENT CONTINENTAL ISLANDS: THE MADAGASCAR GROUP\r\n\r\n    Remarks on Ancient Continental Islands--Physical Features of\r\n    Madagascar--Biological Features of\r\n    Madagascar--Mammalia--Reptiles--Relation of Madagascar to Africa--Early\r\n    History of Africa and Madagascar--Anomalies of Distribution and How to\r\n    Explain Them--The Birds of Madagascar as Indicating a Supposed Lemurian\r\n    Continent--Submerged Islands between Madagascar and India--Concluding\r\n    Remarks on \"Lemuria\"--The Mascarene Islands--The Comoro Islands--The\r\n    Seychelles Archipelago--Birds of the Seychelles--Reptiles and\r\n    Amphibia--Freshwater Fishes--Land Shells--Mauritius, Bourbon, and\r\n    Rodriguez--Birds--Extinct Birds and their Probable\r\n    Origin--Reptiles--Flora of Madagascar and the Mascarene\r\n    Islands--Curious Relations of Mascarene Plants--Endemic Genera of\r\n    Mauritius and Seychelles--Fragmentary Character of the Mascarene\r\n    Flora--Flora of Madagascar Allied to that of South\r\n    Africa--Preponderance of Ferns in the Mascarene Flora--Concluding\r\n    Remarks on the Madagascar Group.\r\n\r\nWe have now to consider the phenomena presented by a very distinct class of\r\nislands--those which, although once forming part of a continent, have been\r\nseparated from it at a remote epoch when its animal forms were very unlike\r\nwhat they are now. Such islands preserve to us the record of a by-gone\r\nworld,--of a period when many of the higher types had not yet come into\r\nexistence and when the distribution of others was very different from what\r\nprevails at the present day. The problem presented by these ancient islands\r\nis often complicated by the changes they themselves have undergone since\r\nthe period of their separation. A partial subsidence will have led to the\r\n{412} extinction of some of the types that were originally preserved, and\r\nmay leave the ancient fauna in a very fragmentary state; while subsequent\r\nelevations may have brought it so near to the continent that some\r\nimmigration even of mammalia may have taken place. If these elevations and\r\nsubsidences occurred several times over, though never to such an extent as\r\nagain to unite the island with the continent, it is evident that a very\r\ncomplex result might be produced; for besides the relics of the ancient\r\nfauna, we might have successive immigrations from surrounding lands\r\nreaching down to the era of existing species. Bearing in mind these\r\npossible changes, we shall generally be able to arrive at a fair\r\nconjectural solution of the phenomena of distribution presented by these\r\nancient islands.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly the most interesting of such islands, and that which exhibits\r\ntheir chief peculiarities in the greatest perfection, is Madagascar, and we\r\nshall therefore enter somewhat fully into its biological and physical\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\n_Physical Features of Madagascar._--This great island is situated about 250\r\nmiles from the east coast of Africa, and extends from 12deg to 25-1/2deg S.\r\nLat. It is almost exactly 1,000 miles long, with an extreme width of 360\r\nand an average width of more than 260 miles. A lofty granitic plateau, from\r\neighty to 160 miles wide and from 3,000 to 5,000 feet high, occupies its\r\ncentral portion, on which rise peaks and domes of basalt and granite to a\r\nheight of nearly 9,000 feet; and there are also numerous extinct volcanic\r\ncones and craters. All round the island, but especially developed on the\r\nsouth and west, are plains of a few hundred feet elevation, formed of rocks\r\nwhich are shown by their fossils to be of Jurassic age, or at all events to\r\nbelong to somewhere near the middle portion of the Secondary period. The\r\nhigher granitic plateau consists of bare undulating moors, while the lower\r\nSecondary plains are more or less wooded; and there is here also a\r\ncontinuous belt of dense forest, varying from six or eight to fifty miles\r\nwide, encircling the whole island, usually at about thirty miles distance\r\nfrom the coast but in the north-east coming down to the sea-shore. {413}\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n{414}\r\n\r\nThe sea around Madagascar, when the shallow bank on which it stands is\r\npassed, is generally deep. This 100-fathom bank is only from one to three\r\nmiles wide on the east side, but on the west it is much broader, and\r\nstretches out opposite Mozambique to a distance of about eighty miles. The\r\nMozambique Channel is rather more than 1,000 fathoms deep, but there is\r\nonly a narrow belt of this depth opposite Mozambique, and still narrower\r\nwhere the Comoro Islands and adjacent shoals seem to form stepping-stones\r\nto the continent of Africa. The 1,000-fathom line includes Aldabra and the\r\nsmall Farquhar Islands to the north of Madagascar; while to the east the\r\nsea deepens rapidly to the 1,000-fathom line and then more slowly, a\r\nprofound channel of 2,400 fathoms separating Madagascar from Bourbon and\r\nMauritius. To the north-east of Mauritius are a series of extensive shoals\r\nforming four large banks less than 100 fathoms below the surface, while the\r\n1,000-fathom line includes them all, with an area about half that of\r\nMadagascar itself. A little further north is the Seychelles group, also\r\nstanding on an extensive 1,000-fathom bank, while all round the sea is more\r\nthan 2,000 fathoms deep.\r\n\r\nIt seems probable, then, that to the north-east of Madagascar there was\r\nonce a series of very large islands, separated from it by not very wide\r\nstraits; while eastward across the Indian Ocean we find the Chagos and\r\nMaldive coral atolls, perhaps marking the position of other large islands,\r\nwhich together would form a line of communication, by comparatively easy\r\nstages of 400 or 500 miles each between Madagascar and India. These\r\nsubmerged islands, as shown in our map at p. 424, are of great importance\r\nin explaining some anomalous features in the zoology of this great island.\r\n\r\nIf the rocks of Secondary age which form a belt around the island are held\r\nto indicate that Madagascar was once of less extent than it is now (though\r\nthis by no means necessarily follows), we have also evidence that it has\r\nrecently been considerably larger; for along the east coast there is an\r\nextensive barrier coral-reef about 350 miles in length, and varying in\r\ndistance from the land from a quarter of a mile to three or four miles.\r\nThis seems to indicate recent subsidence; while we have no record of raised\r\ncoral rocks inland which would certainly mark any recent elevation, though\r\nfringing coral reefs surround a considerable portion of the northern,\r\neastern, and south-western coasts. We may therefore conclude that during\r\nTertiary times the island was usually as large as, and often probably much\r\nlarger than, it is now. {415}\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP OF THE MADAGASCAR GROUP, SHOWING DEPTHS OF SEA.]\r\n\r\nIn this Map the depth of the sea is shown by three tints; the lightest tint\r\nindicating from 0 to 100 fathoms, the medium tint from 100 to 1,000\r\nfathoms, the dark tint more than 1,000 fathoms.\r\n\r\n{416}\r\n\r\n_Biological Features of Madagascar._--Madagascar possesses an exceedingly\r\nrich and beautiful fauna and flora, rivalling in some groups most tropical\r\ncountries of equal extent, and even when poor in species, of surpassing\r\ninterest from the singularity, the isolation, or the beauty of its forms of\r\nlife. In order to exhibit the full peculiarity of its natural history and\r\nthe nature of the problems it offers to the biological student, we must\r\ngive an outline of its more important animal forms in systematic order.\r\n\r\n_Mammalia._--Madagascar possesses no less than sixty-six species of\r\nmammals--a certain proof in itself that the island has once formed part of\r\na continent; but the character of these animals is very extraordinary and\r\naltogether different from the assemblage now found in Africa or in any\r\nother existing continent. Africa is now most prominently characterised by\r\nits monkeys, apes, and baboons; by its lions, leopards, and hyaenas; by its\r\nzebras, rhinoceroses, elephants, buffaloes, giraffes, and numerous species\r\nof antelopes. But no one of these animals, nor any thing like them, is\r\nfound in Madagascar, and thus our first impression would be that it could\r\nnever have been united with the African continent. But, as the tigers, the\r\nbears, the tapirs, the deer, and the numerous squirrels of Asia are equally\r\nabsent, there seems no probability of its having been united with that\r\ncontinent. Let us then see to what groups the mammalia of Madagascar\r\nbelong, and where we must look for their probable allies.\r\n\r\nFirst and most important are the lemurs, consisting of six genera and\r\nthirty-three species, thus comprising just half the entire mammalian\r\npopulation of the island. This group of lowly-organised and very ancient\r\ncreatures {417} still exists scattered over a wide area; but they are\r\nnowhere so abundant as in the island of Madagascar. They are found from\r\nWest Africa to India, Ceylon, and the Malay Archipelago, consisting of a\r\nnumber of isolated genera and species, which appear to maintain their\r\nexistence by their nocturnal and arboreal habits, and by haunting dense\r\nforests. It can hardly be said that the African forms of lemurs are more\r\nnearly allied to those of Madagascar than are the Asiatic, the whole series\r\nappearing to be the disconnected fragments of a once more compact and\r\nextensive group of animals.\r\n\r\nNext, we have about a dozen species of Insectivora, consisting of one\r\nshrew, a group distributed over all the great continents; and five genera\r\nof a peculiar family, Centetidae, which family exists nowhere else on the\r\nglobe except in the two largest West Indian Islands, Cuba and Hayti, thus\r\nadding still further to our embarrassment in seeking for the original home\r\nof the Madagascar fauna.\r\n\r\nWe then come to the Carnivora, which are represented by a peculiar cat-like\r\nanimal, Cryptoprocta, forming a distinct family, and having no close allies\r\nin any part of the globe; and eight civets belonging to four peculiar\r\ngenera. Here we first meet with some decided indications of an African\r\norigin; for the civet family is more abundant in this continent than in\r\nAsia, and some of the Madagascar genera seem to be decidedly allied to\r\nAfrican groups--as, for example, Eupleres to Suricata and Crossarchus.[97]\r\n\r\nThe Rodents consist only of four rats and mice of peculiar genera, one of\r\nwhich is said to be allied to an American genus; and lastly we have a\r\nriver-hog of the African genus Potamochaerus, and a small sub-fossil\r\nhippopotamus, both of which being semi-aquatic animals might easily have\r\nreached the island from Africa, by way of the Comoros, without any actual\r\nland connection.[98]\r\n\r\n_Reptiles of Madagascar._--Passing over the birds for the present, as not\r\nso clearly demonstrating {418} land-connection, let us see what indications\r\nare afforded by the reptiles. The large and universally distributed family\r\nof Colubrine snakes is represented in Madagascar, not by African or Asiatic\r\ngenera, but by two American genera--Philodryas and Heterodon, and by\r\nHerpetodryas, a genus found in America and China. The other genera are all\r\npeculiar, and belong mostly to widespread tropical families; but two\r\nfamilies--Lycodontidae and Viperidae, both abundant in Africa and the\r\nEastern tropics--are absent. Lizards are mostly represented by peculiar\r\ngenera of African or tropical families, but several African genera are\r\nrepresented by peculiar species, and there are also some species belonging\r\nto two American genera of the Iguanidae, a family which is exclusively\r\nAmerican; while a genus of geckoes, inhabiting America and Australia, also\r\noccurs in Madagascar.\r\n\r\n_Relation of Madagascar to Africa._--These facts taken all together are\r\ncertainly very extraordinary, since they show in a considerable number of\r\ncases as much affinity with America as with Africa; while the most striking\r\nand characteristic groups of animals now inhabiting Africa are entirely\r\nwanting in Madagascar. Let us first deal with this fact, of the absence of\r\nso many of the most dominant African groups. The explanation of this\r\ndeficiency is by no means difficult, for the rich deposits of fossil\r\nmammals of Miocene or Pliocene age in France, Germany, Greece, and\r\nNorth-west India, have demonstrated the fact that all the great African\r\nmammals then inhabited Europe and temperate Asia. We also know that a\r\nlittle earlier (in Eocene times) tropical Africa was cut off from Europe\r\nand Asia by a sea stretching from the Atlantic to the Bay of Bengal, at\r\nwhich time Africa must have formed a detached island-continent such as\r\nAustralia is now, and probably, like it, very poor in the higher forms of\r\nlife. Coupling these two facts, the inference seems clear, that all the\r\nhigher types of mammalia were developed in the great Euro-Asiatic continent\r\n(which then included Northern Africa), and that they only migrated into\r\ntropical Africa when the two continents became united by the upheaval of\r\nthe sea-bottom, probably {419} in the latter portion of the Miocene or\r\nearly in the Pliocene period.[99]\r\n\r\nIt is clear, therefore, that if Madagascar had once formed part of Africa,\r\nbut had been separated from it before Africa was united to Europe and Asia,\r\nit would not contain any of those kinds of animals which then first entered\r\nthe country. But, besides the African mammals, we know that some birds now\r\nconfined to Africa then inhabited Europe, and we may therefore fairly\r\nassume that all the more important groups of birds, reptiles, and insects,\r\nnow abundant in Africa but absent from Madagascar, formed no part of the\r\noriginal African fauna, but entered the country only after it was joined to\r\nEurope and Asia.\r\n\r\n_Early History of Africa and Madagascar._--We have seen that Madagascar\r\ncontains an abundance of mammals, and that most of them are of types either\r\npeculiar to, or existing also in, Africa; it follows that that continent\r\nmust have had an earlier union with Europe, Asia, or America, or it could\r\nnever have obtained any mammals at all.\r\n\r\n{420} Now these ancient African mammals are Lemurs, Insectivora, and small\r\nCarnivora, chiefly Viverridae; and all these groups are known to have\r\ninhabited Europe in Eocene and Miocene times; and that the union was with\r\nEurope rather than with America is clearly proved by the fact that even the\r\ninsectivorous Centetidae, now confined to Madagascar and the West Indies,\r\ninhabited France in the Lower Miocene period, while the Viverridae, or\r\ncivets, which form so important a part of the fauna of Madagascar as well\r\nas of Africa, were abundant in Europe throughout the whole Tertiary period,\r\nbut are not known to have ever lived in any part of the American continent.\r\nWe here see the application of the principle which we have already fully\r\nproved and illustrated (Chapter IV., p. 60), that all extensive groups have\r\na wide range at the period of their maximum development; but as they decay\r\ntheir area of distribution diminishes or breaks up into detached fragments,\r\nwhich one after another disappear till the group becomes extinct. Those\r\nanimal forms which we now find isolated in Madagascar and other remote\r\nportions of the globe all belong to ancient groups which are in a decaying\r\nor nearly extinct condition, while those which are absent from it belong to\r\nmore recent and more highly-developed types, which range over extensive and\r\ncontinuous areas, but have had no opportunity of reaching the more ancient\r\ncontinental islands.\r\n\r\n_Anomalies of Distribution and How to Explain Them._--If these\r\nconsiderations have any weight, it follows that there is no reason whatever\r\nfor supposing any former direct connection between Madagascar and the\r\nGreater Antilles merely because the insectivorous Centetidae now exist only\r\nin these two groups of islands; for we know that the ancestors of this\r\nfamily must once have had a much wider range, which almost certainly\r\nextended over the great northern continents. We might as reasonably suppose\r\na land-connection across the Pacific to account for the camels of Asia\r\nhaving their nearest existing allies in the llamas and alpacas of the\r\nPeruvian Andes, and another between Sumatra and Brazil, in order that the\r\nancestral tapir of one country might have passed over to the other. In both\r\n{421} these cases we have ample proof of the former wide extension of the\r\ngroup. Extinct camels of numerous species abounded in North America in\r\nMiocene, Pliocene, and even Post-pliocene times, and one has also been\r\nfound in North-western India, but none whatever among all the rich deposits\r\nof mammalia in Europe. We are thus told, as clearly as possible, that from\r\nthe North American continent as a centre the camel tribe spread westward,\r\nover now-submerged land at the shallow Behring Straits and Kamschatka Sea,\r\ninto Asia, and southward along the Andes into South America. Tapirs are\r\neven more interesting and instructive. Their remotest known ancestors\r\nappear in Western Europe in the early portion of the Eocene period; in the\r\nlatter Eocene and the Miocene other forms occur both in Europe and North\r\nAmerica. These seem to have become extinct in North America, while in\r\nEurope they developed largely into many forms of true tapirs, which at a\r\nmuch later period found their way again to North, and thence to South,\r\nAmerica, where their remains are found in caves and gravel deposits. It is\r\nan instructive fact that in the Eastern continent, where they were once so\r\nabundant, they have dwindled down to a single species, existing in small\r\nnumbers in the Malay Peninsula, Sumatra, and Borneo only; while in the\r\nWestern continent, where they are comparatively recent immigrants, they\r\noccupy a much larger area, and are represented by three or four distinct\r\nspecies. Who could possibly have imagined such migrations, and extinctions,\r\nand changes of distribution as are demonstrated in the case of the tapirs,\r\nif we had only the distribution of the existing species to found an opinion\r\nupon? Such cases as these--and there are many others equally striking--show\r\nus with the greatest distinctness how nature has worked in bringing about\r\nthe examples of anomalous distribution that everywhere meet us; and we\r\nmust, on every ground of philosophy and common sense, apply the same method\r\nof interpretation to the more numerous instances of anomalous distribution\r\nwe discover among such groups as reptiles, birds, and insects, where we\r\nrarely have any direct evidence of their past migrations through the\r\ndiscovery of {422} fossil remains. Whenever we can trace the past history\r\nof any group of terrestrial animals, we invariably find that its actual\r\ndistribution can be explained by migrations effected by means of\r\ncomparatively slight modifications of our existing continents. In no single\r\ncase have we any direct evidence that the distribution of land and sea has\r\nbeen radically changed during the whole lapse of the Tertiary and Secondary\r\nperiods, while, as we have already shown in our fifth chapter, the\r\ntestimony of geology itself, if fairly interpreted, upholds the same theory\r\nof the stability of our continents and the permanence of our oceans. Yet so\r\neasy and pleasant is it to speculate on former changes of land and sea with\r\nwhich to cut the gordian knot offered by anomalies of distribution, that we\r\nstill continually meet with suggestions of former continents stretching in\r\nevery direction across the deepest oceans, in order to explain the presence\r\nin remote parts of the globe of the same genera even of plants or of\r\ninsects--organisms which possess such exceptional facilities both for\r\nterrestrial, aerial, and oceanic transport, and of whose distribution in\r\nearly geological periods we generally know little or nothing.\r\n\r\n_The Birds of Madagascar, as Indicating a Supposed Lemurian\r\nContinent._--Having thus shown how the distribution of the land mammalia\r\nand reptiles of Madagascar may be well explained by the supposition of a\r\nunion with Africa before the greater part of its existing fauna had reached\r\nit, we have now to consider whether, as some ornithologists think, the\r\ndistribution and affinities of the birds present an insuperable objection\r\nto this view, and require the adoption of a hypothetical\r\ncontinent--Lemuria--extending from Madagascar to Ceylon and the Malay\r\nIslands.\r\n\r\nThere are about one hundred and fifty land birds known from the island of\r\nMadagascar, of which a hundred and twenty-seven are peculiar; and about\r\nhalf of these peculiar species belong to peculiar genera, many of which are\r\nextremely isolated, so that it is often difficult to class them in any of\r\nthe recognised families, or to determine their affinities to any living\r\nbirds.[100] Among the other moiety, {423} belonging to known genera, we\r\nfind fifteen which have undoubted African affinities, while five or six are\r\nas decidedly Oriental, the genera or nearest allied species being found in\r\nIndia or the Malay Islands. It is on the presence of these peculiar Indian\r\ntypes that Dr. Hartlaub, in his recent work on the _Birds of Madagascar and\r\nthe Adjacent Islands_, lays great stress, as proving the former existence\r\nof \"Lemuria\"; while he considers the absence of such peculiar African\r\nfamilies as the plantain-eaters, glossy-starlings, ox-peckers, barbets,\r\nhoney-guides, hornbills, and bustards--besides a host of peculiar African\r\ngenera--as sufficiently disproving the statement in my _Geographical\r\nDistribution of Animals_ that Madagascar is \"more nearly related to the\r\nEthiopian than to any other region,\" and that its fauna was evidently\r\n\"mainly derived from Africa.\"\r\n\r\nBut the absence of the numerous peculiar groups of African birds is so\r\nexactly parallel to the same phenomenon among mammals, that we are\r\njustified in imputing it to the same cause, the more especially as some of\r\nthe very groups that are wanting--the plantain-eaters and the trogons, for\r\nexample,--are actually known to have inhabited Europe along with the large\r\nmammalia which subsequently migrated to Africa. As to the peculiarly\r\nEastern genera--such as Copsychus and Hypsipetes, with a Dicrurus, a\r\nPloceus, a Cisticola, and a Scops, all closely allied to Indian or Malayan\r\nspecies--although very striking to the ornithologist, they certainly do not\r\noutweigh the fourteen African genera found in Madagascar. Their presence\r\nmay, moreover, be accounted for more satisfactorily than by means of an\r\nancient Lemurian continent, which, even if granted, would not explain the\r\nvery facts adduced in its support.\r\n\r\nLet us first prove this latter statement.\r\n\r\nThe supposed \"Lemuria\" must have existed, if at all, at so remote a period\r\nthat the higher animals did not then inhabit either Africa or Southern\r\nAsia, and it must have {424} become partially or wholly submerged before\r\nthey reached those countries; otherwise we should find in Madagascar many\r\nother animals besides Lemurs, Insectivora, and Viverridae, especially such\r\nactive arboreal creatures as monkeys and squirrels, such hardy grazers as\r\ndeer or antelopes, or such wide-ranging carnivores as foxes or bears. This\r\nobliges us to date the disappearance of the hypothetical continent about\r\nthe earlier part of the Miocene epoch at latest, for during the latter part\r\nof that period we know that such animals existed in abundance in every part\r\nof the great northern continents wherever we have found organic remains.\r\nBut the Oriental birds in Madagascar, by whose presence Dr. Hartlaub\r\nupholds the theory of a Lemuria, are slightly modified forms of _existing\r\nIndian genera_, or sometimes, as Dr. Hartlaub himself points out, _species\r\nhardly distinguishable from those of India_. Now all the evidence at our\r\ncommand leads us to conclude that, even if these genera and species were in\r\nexistence in the early Miocene period, they must have had a widely\r\ndifferent distribution from what they have now. Along with so many African\r\nand Indian genera of mammals they then probably inhabited Europe, which at\r\nthat epoch enjoyed a sub-tropical climate; and this is rendered almost\r\ncertain by the discovery in the Miocene of France of fossil remains of\r\ntrogons and jungle-fowl. If, then, these Indian birds date back to the very\r\nperiod during which alone Lemuria could have existed, that continent was\r\nquite unnecessary for their introduction into Madagascar, as they could\r\nhave followed the same track as the mammalia of Miocene Europe and Asia;\r\nwhile if, as I maintain, they are of more recent date, then Lemuria had\r\nceased to exist, and could not have been the means of their introduction.\r\n\r\n_Submerged Islands between Madagascar and India._--Looking at the\r\naccompanying map of the Indian Ocean, we see that between Madagascar and\r\nIndia there are now extensive shoals and coral reefs, such as are usually\r\nheld to indicate subsidence; and we may therefore fairly postulate the\r\nformer existence here of several large islands, some of them not much\r\ninferior to Madagascar itself. These reefs are all separated from each\r\nother by very deep {425} sea--much deeper than that which divides\r\nMadagascar from Africa, and we have therefore no reason to imagine their\r\nformer union. But they would nevertheless greatly facilitate the\r\nintroduction of Indian birds into the Mascarene Islands and Madagascar; and\r\nthese facilities existing, such an immigration would be sure to take place,\r\njust as surely as American birds have entered the Galapagos and Juan\r\nFernandez, as European birds now reach the Azores, and as Australian birds\r\nreach such a distant island as New Zealand. This would take place the more\r\ncertainly because the Indian Ocean is a region of violent periodical storms\r\nat the changes of the monsoons, and we have seen in the case of the Azores\r\nand Bermuda how important a factor this is in determining the transport of\r\nbirds across the ocean.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP OF THE INDIAN OCEAN.\r\n\r\nShowing the position of banks less than 1,000 fathoms deep between Africa\r\nand the Indian Peninsula.]\r\n\r\n{426}\r\n\r\nThe final disappearance of these now sunken islands does not, in all\r\nprobability, date back to a very remote epoch; and this exactly accords\r\nwith the fact that some of the birds, as well as the fruit-bats of the\r\ngenus Pteropus, are very closely allied to Indian species, if not actually\r\nidentical, others being distinct species of the same genera. The fact that\r\nnot one closely-allied species or even genus of Indian or Malayan mammals\r\nis found in Madagascar, sufficiently proves that it is no land-connection\r\nthat has brought about this small infusion of Indian birds and bats; while\r\nwe have sufficiently shown, that, when we go back to remote geological\r\ntimes no land-connection in this direction was necessary to explain the\r\nphenomena of the distribution of the Lemurs and Insectivora. A\r\nland-connection with _some_ continent was undoubtedly necessary, or there\r\nwould have been no mammalia at all in Madagascar; and the nature of its\r\nfauna on the whole, no less than the moderate depth of the intervening\r\nstrait and the comparative approximation of the opposite shores, clearly\r\nindicate that the connection was with Africa.\r\n\r\n_Concluding Remarks on \"Lemuria.\"_--I have gone into this question in some\r\ndetail, because Dr. Hartlaub's criticism on my views has been reproduced in\r\na scientific periodical,[101] and the supposed Lemurian continent is\r\nconstantly referred to by quasi-scientific writers, as well as by\r\nnaturalists and geologists, as if its existence had been demonstrated by\r\nfacts, or as if it were absolutely necessary to postulate such a land in\r\norder to account for the entire series of phenomena connected with the\r\nMadagascar fauna, and especially with the distribution of the\r\nLemuridae.[102] I {427} think I have now shown, on the other hand, that it\r\nwas essentially a provisional hypothesis, very useful in calling attention\r\nto a remarkable series of problems in geographical distribution, but not\r\naffording the true solution of those problems, any more than the hypothesis\r\nof an Atlantis solved the problems presented by the Atlantic Islands and\r\nthe relations of the European and North American flora and fauna. The\r\nAtlantis is now rarely introduced seriously except by the absolutely\r\nunscientific, having received its death-blow by the chapter on Oceanic\r\nIslands in the _Origin of Species_, and the researches of Professor Asa\r\nGray on the affinities of the North American and Asiatic floras. But\r\n\"Lemuria\" still keeps its place--a good example of the survival of a\r\nprovisional hypothesis which offers what seems an easy solution of a\r\ndifficult problem, and has received an appropriate and easily remembered\r\nname, long after it has been proved to be untenable.\r\n\r\nIt is now more than fifteen years since I first showed, by a careful\r\nexamination of all the facts to be accounted for, that the hypothesis of a\r\nLemurian continent was alike unnecessary to explain one portion of the\r\nfacts, and inadequate to explain the remaining portion.[103] Since that\r\ntime I have seen no attempt even to discuss the question on general grounds\r\nin opposition to my views, nor on the other hand have those who have\r\nhitherto supported the hypothesis taken any opportunity of acknowledging\r\nits weakness and inutility. I have therefore here explained my reasons for\r\nrejecting it somewhat more fully and in a more popular form, in the hope\r\nthat a check may thus be placed on the continued re-statement of this\r\nunsound theory as if it were one of the accepted conclusions of modern\r\nscience.\r\n\r\n{428}\r\n\r\n_The Mascarene Islands._[104]--In the _Geographical Distribution of\r\nAnimals_, a summary is given of all that was known of the zoology of the\r\nvarious islands near Madagascar, which to some extent partake of its\r\npeculiarities, and with it form the Malagasy sub-region of the Ethiopian\r\nregion. As no great additions have since been made to our knowledge of the\r\nfauna of these islands, and my object in this volume being more especially\r\nto illustrate the mode of solving distributional problems by means of the\r\nmost suitable examples, I shall now confine myself to pointing out how far\r\nthe facts presented by these outlying islands support the views already\r\nenunciated with regard to the origin of the Madagascar fauna.\r\n\r\n_The Comoro Islands._--This group of islands is situated nearly midway\r\nbetween the northern extremity of Madagascar and the coast of Africa. The\r\nfour chief islands vary between sixteen and forty miles in length, the\r\nlargest being 180 miles from the coast of Africa, while one or two smaller\r\nislets are less than 100 miles from Madagascar. All are volcanic, Great\r\nComoro being an active volcano 8,500 feet high; and, as already stated,\r\nthey are situated on a submarine bank with less than 500 fathoms soundings,\r\nconnecting Madagascar with Africa. There is reason to believe, however,\r\nthat these islands are of comparatively recent origin, and that the bank\r\nhas been formed by matter ejected by the volcanoes or by upheaval. Anyhow,\r\nthere is no indication whatever of there having been here a land-connection\r\nbetween Madagascar and Africa; while the islands themselves have been\r\nmainly colonised from Madagascar, some of them making a near approach to\r\nthe 100-fathom bank which surrounds that island.\r\n\r\nThe Comoros contain two land mammals, a lemur and a civet, both of\r\nMadagascar genera and the latter an identical species, and there is also a\r\npeculiar species of fruit-bat (_Pteropus comorensis_), a group which ranges\r\nfrom Australia to Asia and Madagascar but is unknown in Africa. Of\r\nland-birds forty-one species are known, of {429} which sixteen are peculiar\r\nto the islands, twenty-one are found also in Madagascar, and three found in\r\nAfrica and not in Madagascar; while of the peculiar species, six belong to\r\nMadagascar or Mascarene genera. A species of Chameleon is also peculiar to\r\nthe islands.\r\n\r\nThese facts point to the conclusion that the Comoro Islands have been\r\nformerly more nearly connected with Madagascar than they are now, probably\r\nby means of intervening islets and the former extension of the latter\r\nisland to the westward, as indicated by the extensive shallow bank at its\r\nnorthern extremity, so as to allow of the easy passage of birds, and the\r\noccasional transmission of small mammalia by means of floating trees.[105]\r\n\r\n_The Seychelles Archipelago._--This interesting group consists of about\r\nthirty small islands situated 700 miles N.N.E. of Madagascar, or almost\r\nexactly in the line formed by continuing the central ridge of that great\r\nisland. The Seychelles stand upon a rather extensive shallow bank, the\r\n100-fathom line around them enclosing an area nearly 200 miles long by 100\r\nmiles wide, while the 500-fathom line shows an extension of nearly 100\r\nmiles in a southern direction. All the larger islands are of granite, with\r\nmountains rising to 3,000 feet in Mahe, and to from 1,000 to 2,000 feet in\r\nseveral of the other islands. We can therefore hardly doubt that they form\r\na portion of the great line of upheaval which produced the central granitic\r\nmass of Madagascar, intervening points being indicated by the Amirantes,\r\nthe Providence, and the Farquhar Islands, which, though all coralline,\r\nprobably rest on a granitic basis. Deep channels of more than 1,000 fathoms\r\nnow separate these islands from each other, and if they were ever\r\nsufficiently elevated to be united, it was probably at a very remote epoch.\r\n\r\nThe Seychelles may thus have had ample facilities for receiving from\r\nMadagascar such immigrants as can pass over narrow seas; and, on the other\r\nhand, they were equally favourably situated as regards the extensive Saya\r\nde Malha and Cargados banks, which were probably once {430} large islands,\r\nand may have supported a rich insular flora and fauna of mixed Mascarene\r\nand Indian type. The existing fauna and flora of the Seychelles must\r\ntherefore be looked upon as the remnants which have survived the partial\r\nsubmergence of a very extensive island; and the entire absence of\r\nnon-aerial mammalia may be due, either to this island having never been\r\nactually united to Madagascar, or to its having since undergone so much\r\nsubmergence as to have led to the extinction of such mammals as may once\r\nhave inhabited it. The birds and reptiles, however, though few in number,\r\nare very interesting, and throw some further light on the past history of\r\nthe Seychelles.\r\n\r\n_Birds of the Seychelles._--Fifteen indigenous land-birds are known to\r\ninhabit the group, thirteen of which are peculiar species,[106] belonging\r\nto genera which occur also in Madagascar or Africa. The genera which are\r\nmore peculiarly Indian are,--Copsychus and Hypsipetes, also found in\r\nMadagascar; and Palaeornis, which has species in Mauritius and Rodriguez,\r\nas well as one on the continent of Africa. A black parrot (Coracopsis),\r\ncongeneric with two species that inhabit Madagascar and with one that is\r\npeculiar to the Comoros; and a beautiful red-headed blue pigeon\r\n(_Alectoraenas pulcherrimus_) allied to those of Madagascar and Mauritius,\r\nbut very distinct, are the most remarkable species characteristic of this\r\ngroup of islands.\r\n\r\n_Reptiles and Amphibia of the Seychelles._--The reptiles and amphibia are\r\nrather numerous and very interesting, indicating clearly that the islands\r\ncan hardly be classed as oceanic. There are seven species of lizards, three\r\nbeing peculiar to the islands, while the others have rather a wide range.\r\nThe first is a chameleon--defenceless {431} slow-moving lizards, especially\r\nabundant in Madagascar, from which no less than eighteen species are now\r\nknown, about the same number as on the continent of Africa. The Seychelles\r\nspecies (_Chamaeleon tigris_) also occurs at Zanzibar. The next are skinks\r\n(Scincidae), small ground-lizards with a wide distribution in the Eastern\r\nhemisphere. Two species are however peculiar to the islands--_Mabuia\r\nseychellensis_ and _M. wrightii_. The other peculiar species is one of the\r\ngeckoes (Geckotidae) named _Aeluronyx seychellensis_, and there are also\r\nthree other geckoes, _Phelsuma madagascarensis_, _Gehyra mutilata_ and\r\n_Hemidactylus frenatus_, the two latter having a wide distribution in the\r\ntropical regions of both hemispheres. These lizards, clinging as they do to\r\ntrees and timber, are exceedingly liable to be carried in ships from one\r\ncountry to another, and I am told by Dr. Guenther that some are found\r\nalmost every year in the London Docks. It is therefore probable, that when\r\nspecies of this family have a very wide range they have been assisted in\r\ntheir migrations by man, though their habit of clinging to trees also\r\nrenders them likely to be floated with large pieces of timber to\r\nconsiderable distances. Dr. Percival Wright, to whom I am indebted for much\r\ninformation on the productions of the Seychelles Archipelago, informs me\r\nthat the last-named species varies greatly in colour in the different\r\nislands, so that he could always tell from which particular island a\r\nspecimen had been brought. This is analogous to the curious fact of certain\r\nlizards on the small islands in the Mediterranean being always very\r\ndifferent in colour from those of the mainland, usually becoming rich blue\r\nor black (see _Nature_, Vol. XIX. p. 97); and we thus learn how readily in\r\nsome cases differences of colour are brought about, either directly or\r\nindirectly, by local conditions.\r\n\r\nSnakes, as is usually the case in small or remote islands, are far less\r\nnumerous than lizards, only two species being known. One, _Dromicus\r\nseychellensis_, is a peculiar species of the family Colubridae, the rest of\r\nthe genus being found in Madagascar and South America. The other, _Boodon\r\ngeometricus_, one of the Lycodontidae, or fanged ground-snakes, is also\r\npeculiar. So far, then, as the reptiles are {432} concerned, there is\r\nnothing but what is easily explicable by what we know of the general means\r\nof distribution of these animals.\r\n\r\nWe now come to the Amphibia, which are represented in the Seychelles by two\r\ntailless and two serpent-like forms. The frogs are _Rana mascareniensis_,\r\nfound also in Mauritius, Bourbon, Angola, and Abyssinia, and probably all\r\nover tropical Africa; and _Megalixalus seychellensis_ a peculiar tree-frog\r\nhaving allies in Madagascar and tropical Africa. It is found, Dr. Wright\r\ninforms me, on the Pandani or screw-pines; and as these form a very\r\ncharacteristic portion of the vegetation of the Mascarene Islands, all the\r\nspecies being peculiar and confined each to a single island or small group,\r\nwe may perhaps consider it as a relic of the indigenous fauna of that more\r\nextensive land of which the present islands are the remains.\r\n\r\nThe serpentine Amphibia are represented by two species of Caecilia. These\r\ncreatures externally resemble large worms, except that they have a true\r\nhead with jaws and rudimentary eyes, while internally they have of course a\r\ntrue vertebrate skeleton. They live underground, burrowing by means of the\r\nring-like folds of the skin which simulate the jointed segments of a worm's\r\nbody, and when caught they exude a viscid slime. The young have external\r\ngills which are afterwards replaced by true lungs, and this peculiar\r\nmetamorphosis shows that they belong to the amphibia rather than to the\r\nreptiles. The Caecilias are widely but very sparingly distributed through\r\nall the tropical regions; a fact which may, as we have seen, be taken as an\r\nindication of the great antiquity of the group, and that it is now verging\r\ntowards extinction. In the Seychelles Islands there appear to be three\r\nspecies of these singular animals. _Cryptopsophis multiplicatus_ is\r\nconfined to the islands; _Herpele squalostoma_ is found also in Western\r\nIndia and in Africa; while _Hypogeophis rostratus_ inhabits both West\r\nAfrica and South America.[107] This last is certainly one of the most\r\nremarkable cases of the wide and discontinuous distribution of a species;\r\nand {433} when we consider the habits of life of these animals and the\r\nextreme slowness with which it is likely they can migrate into new areas,\r\nwe can hardly arrive at any other conclusion than that this species once\r\nhad an almost world-wide range, and that in the process of dying out it has\r\nbeen left stranded, as it were, in these three remote portions of the\r\nglobe. The extreme stability and long persistence of specific form which\r\nthis implies is extraordinary, but not unprecedented, among the lower\r\nvertebrates. The crocodiles of the Eocene period differ but slightly from\r\nthose of the present day, while a small freshwater turtle from the Pliocene\r\ndeposits of the Siwalik Hills is absolutely identical with a still living\r\nIndian species, _Emys tectus_. The mud-fish of Australia, _Ceratodus\r\nforsteri_ is a very ancient type, and may well have remained specifically\r\nunchanged since early Tertiary times. It is not, therefore, incredible that\r\nthis Seychelles Caecilia may be the oldest land vertebrate now living on\r\nthe globe; dating back to the early part of the Tertiary period, when the\r\nwarm climate of the northern hemisphere in high latitudes and the union of\r\nthe Asiatic and American continents allowed of the migration of such types\r\nover the whole northern hemisphere, from which they subsequently passed\r\ninto the southern hemisphere, maintaining themselves only in certain\r\nlimited areas, where the physical conditions were especially favourable, or\r\nwhere they were saved from the attacks of enemies or the competition of\r\nhigher forms.\r\n\r\n_Fresh-water Fishes._--The only other vertebrates in the Seychelles are two\r\nfresh-water fishes abounding in the streams and rivulets. One, _Haplochilus\r\nplayfairii_ is peculiar to the islands, but there are allied species in\r\nMadagascar. It is a pretty little fish about four inches long, of an olive\r\ncolour, with rows of red spots, and is very abundant in some of the\r\nmountain streams. The fishes of this genus, as I am informed by Dr.\r\nGuenther, often inhabit both sea and fresh water, so that their migration\r\nfrom {434} Madagascar to the Seychelles and subsequent modification, offers\r\nno difficulty. The other species is _Fundulus orthonotus_, found also on\r\nthe east coast of Africa; and as both belong to the same\r\nfamily--Cyprinodontidae--this may possibly have migrated in a similar\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\n_Land-shells._--The only other group of animals inhabiting the Seychelles\r\nwhich we know with any approach to completeness, are the land and\r\nfresh-water mollusca, but they do not furnish any facts of special\r\ninterest. About forty species are known, and Mr. Geoffrey Nevill, who has\r\nstudied them, thinks their meagre number is chiefly owing to the\r\ndestruction of so much of the forests which once covered the islands. Seven\r\nof the species--and among them one of the most conspicuous, _Achatina\r\nfulica_--have almost certainly been introduced; and the remainder show a\r\nmixture of Madagascar and Indian forms, with a preponderance of the latter.\r\nFive genera--Streptaxis, Cyathoponea, Onchidium, Helicina and Paludomus,\r\nare mentioned as being especially Indian, while only two--Tropidophora and\r\nGibbus, are found in Madagascar but not in India.[108] About two-thirds of\r\nthe species appear to be peculiar to the islands.\r\n\r\n_Mauritius, Bourbon and Rodriguez._--These three islands are somewhat out\r\nof place in this chapter, because they really belong to the oceanic group,\r\nbeing of volcanic formation, surrounded by deep sea, and possessing no\r\nindigenous mammals or amphibia. Yet their productions are so closely\r\nrelated to those of Madagascar, to which they may be considered as\r\nattendant satellites, that it is absolutely necessary to associate them\r\ntogether if we wish to comprehend and explain their many interesting\r\nfeatures.\r\n\r\nMauritius and Bourbon are lofty volcanic islands, evidently of great\r\nantiquity. They are about 100 miles apart, and the sea between them is less\r\nthan 1,000 fathoms deep, while on each side it sinks rapidly to depths of\r\n2,400 and 2,600 fathoms. We have therefore no reason to believe that they\r\nhave ever been connected with {435} Madagascar, and this view is strongly\r\nsupported by the character of their indigenous fauna. Of this, however, we\r\nhave not a very complete or accurate knowledge, for though both islands\r\nhave long been occupied by Europeans, the study of their natural products\r\nwas for a long time greatly neglected, and owing to the rapid spread of\r\nsugar cultivation, the virgin forests, and with them no doubt many native\r\nanimals, have been almost wholly destroyed. There is, however, no good\r\nevidence of there ever having been any indigenous mammals or amphibia,\r\nthough both are now found and are often recorded among the native\r\nanimals.[109]\r\n\r\nThe smaller and more remote island, Rodriguez, is also volcanic; but it\r\nhas, besides a good deal of coralline rock, an indication of partial\r\nsubmergence helping to account for the poverty of its fauna and flora. It\r\nstands on a 100-fathom bank of considerable extent, but beyond this the\r\n{436} sea rapidly deepens to more than 2,000 fathoms, so that it is truly\r\noceanic like its larger sister isles.\r\n\r\n_Birds._--The living birds of these islands are few in number and consist\r\nmainly of peculiar species of Mascarene types, together with two peculiar\r\ngenera--Oxynotus belonging to the Campephagidae or caterpillar-catchers, a\r\nfamily abundant in the old-world tropics; and a dove, Trocazza, forming a\r\npeculiar sub-genus. The origin of these birds offers no difficulty, looking\r\nat the position of the islands and of the surrounding shoals and islets.\r\n\r\n_Extinct Birds._--These three islands are, however, preeminently remarkable\r\nas having been the home of a group of large ground-birds, quite incapable\r\nof flight, and altogether unlike anything found elsewhere on the globe; and\r\nwhich, though once very abundant, have become totally extinct within the\r\nlast two hundred years. The best known of these birds is the dodo, which\r\ninhabited Mauritius; while allied species certainly lived in Bourbon and\r\nRodriguez, abundant remains of the species of the latter island--the\r\n\"solitaire,\" having been discovered, corresponding with the figure and\r\ndescription given of it by Legouat, who resided in Rodriguez in 1692. These\r\nbirds constitute a distinct family, Dididae, allied to the pigeons but very\r\nisolated. They were quite defenceless, and were rapidly exterminated when\r\nman introduced dogs, pigs, and cats into the island, and himself sought\r\nthem for food. The fact that such perfectly unprotected creatures survived\r\nin great abundance to a quite recent period in these three islands only,\r\nwhile there is no evidence of their ever having inhabited any other\r\ncountries whatever, is itself almost demonstrative that Mauritius, Bourbon,\r\nand Rodriguez are very ancient but truly oceanic islands. From what we know\r\nof the general similarity of Miocene birds to living genera and families,\r\nit seems clear that the origin of so remarkable a type as the dodos must\r\ndate back to early Tertiary times. If we suppose some ancestral\r\nground-feeding pigeon of large size to have reached the group by means of\r\nintervening islands afterwards submerged, and to have thenceforth remained\r\nto increase and multiply unchecked by the attacks of any more {437}\r\npowerful animals, we can well understand that the wings, being useless,\r\nwould in time become almost aborted.[110] It is also not improbable that\r\nthis process would be aided by natural selection, because the use of wings\r\nmight be absolutely prejudicial to the birds in their new home. Those that\r\nflew up into trees to roost, or tried to cross over the mouths of rivers,\r\nmight be blown out to sea and destroyed, especially during the hurricanes\r\nwhich have probably always more or less devastated the islands; while on\r\nthe other hand the more bulky and short-winged individuals, who took to\r\nsleeping on the ground in the forest, would be preserved from such dangers,\r\nand perhaps also from the attacks of birds of prey which may always have\r\nvisited the islands. But whether or no this was the mode by which these\r\nsingular birds acquired their actual form and structure, it is perfectly\r\ncertain that their existence and development depended on complete isolation\r\nand on freedom from the attacks of enemies. We have no single example of\r\nsuch defenceless birds having ever existed on a continent at any geological\r\nperiod, whereas analogous though totally distinct forms do exist in New\r\nZealand, where enemies are equally wanting. On the other hand, every\r\ncontinent has always produced abundance of carnivora adapted to prey upon\r\nthe herbivorous animals inhabiting it at the same period; and we may\r\ntherefore be sure that {438} these islands have never formed part of a\r\ncontinent during any portion of the time when the dodos inhabited them.\r\n\r\nIt is a remarkable thing that an ornithologist of Dr. Hartlaub's\r\nreputation, looking at the subject from a purely ornithological point of\r\nview, should yet entirely ignore the evidence of these wonderful and unique\r\nbirds against his own theory, when he so confidently characterises Lemuria\r\nas \"that sunken land, which, containing parts of Africa, must have extended\r\nfar eastward over Southern India and Ceylon, and the highest points of\r\nwhich we recognise in the volcanic peaks of Bourbon and Mauritius, and in\r\nthe central range of Madagascar itself--the last resorts of the mostly\r\nextinct Lemurine race which formerly peopled it.\"[111] It is here implied\r\nthat lemurs formerly inhabited Bourbon and Mauritius, but of this there is\r\nnot a particle of evidence, and we feel pretty sure that had they done so\r\nthe dodos would never have been developed there. In Madagascar there are no\r\ntraces of dodos, while there are remains of extinct gigantic struthious\r\nbirds of the genus Aepyornis, which were no doubt as well able to protect\r\nthemselves against the smaller carnivora as are the ostriches, emus, and\r\ncassowaries in their respective countries at the present day.\r\n\r\nThe whole of the evidence at our command, therefore, tends to establish in\r\na very complete manner the \"oceanic\" character of the three\r\nislands--Mauritius, Bourbon, and Rodriguez, and that they have never formed\r\npart of \"Lemuria\" or of any continent.\r\n\r\n_Reptiles._--Mauritius, like Bourbon, has lizards, some of which are\r\npeculiar species; but no snakes, and no frogs or toads but such as have\r\nbeen introduced.[112] Strange to say, however, a small islet called Round\r\nIsland, only about a mile across, and situated about fourteen miles\r\nnorth-east of Mauritius, possesses a snake which is not only unknown in\r\nMauritius, but also in any other part of the world, being {439} altogether\r\nconfined to this minute islet! It belongs to the boa family, and forms a\r\npeculiar and very distinct genus, Casaria, whose nearest allies seem to be\r\nthe Ungalia of Cuba and Bolyeria of Australia. It is hardly possible to\r\nbelieve that this serpent has very long maintained itself on so small an\r\nisland; and though we have no record of its existence on Mauritius, it may\r\nvery well have inhabited the lowland forests without being met with by the\r\nearly settlers; and the introduction of swine, which soon ran wild and\r\neffected the final destruction of the dodo, may also have been fatal to\r\nthis snake. It is, however, now almost certainly confined to the one small\r\nislet, and is probably the land-vertebrate of most restricted distribution\r\non the globe.\r\n\r\nOn the same island there is a small lizard, _Scelotes bojeri_, recorded\r\nalso from Mauritius and Bourbon, though it appears to be rare in both\r\nislands; but a gecko, _Phelsuma guentheri_, is restricted to the island. As\r\nRound Island is connected with Mauritius by a bank under a hundred fathoms\r\nbelow the surface, it has probably been once joined to it, and when first\r\nseparated would have been both much larger and much nearer the main island,\r\ncircumstances which would greatly facilitate the transmission of these\r\nreptiles to their present dwelling-place, where they have been able to\r\nmaintain themselves owing to the complete absence of competition, while\r\nsome of them have become extinct in the larger island.\r\n\r\n_Flora of Madagascar and the Mascarene Islands._--The botany of the great\r\nisland of Madagascar has been perhaps more thoroughly explored than that of\r\nthe opposite coasts of Africa, so that its peculiarities may not be really\r\nso great as they now appear to be. Yet there can be no doubt of its extreme\r\nrichness and grandeur, its remarkable speciality, and its anomalous\r\nexternal relations. It is characterised by a great abundance of\r\nforest-trees and shrubs of peculiar genera or species, and often adorned\r\nwith magnificent flowers. Some of these are allied to African forms, others\r\nto those of Asia, and it is said that of the two affinities the latter\r\npreponderates. But there are also, as in the animal world, some decided\r\nSouth {440} American relations, while other groups point to Australia, or\r\nare altogether isolated.\r\n\r\nNo less than 3,740 flowering plants are now known from Madagascar with 360\r\nferns and fern-allies. The most abundant natural orders are the following:\r\n\r\n                  Species.\r\n  Leguminosae         346\r\n  Ferns               318\r\n  Compositae          281\r\n  Euphorbiaceae       228\r\n  Orchideae           170\r\n  Cyperaceae          160\r\n  Rubiaceae           147\r\n  Acanthaceae         131\r\n  Gramineae           130\r\n\r\nThe flora contains representatives of 144 natural orders and 970 genera,\r\none of the former and 148 of the latter being peculiar to the island. The\r\npeculiar order, Chaelnaceae, comprises seven genera and twenty-four\r\nspecies; while Rubiaceae and Compositae have the largest number of peculiar\r\ngenera, followed by Leguminosae and Melastomaceae. Nearly three-fourths of\r\nthe species are endemic.\r\n\r\nBeautiful flowers are not conspicuous in the flora of Madagascar, though it\r\ncontains several magnificent flowering plants. A shrub with the dreadful\r\nname _Harpagophytum Grandidieri_ has bunches of gorgeous red flowers;\r\n_Tristellateia madagascariensis_ is a climbing plant with spikes of rich\r\nyellow flowers; while _Poinciana regia_, a tall tree, _Rhodolaena altivola_\r\nand _Astrapoea Wallichii_, shrubs, are among the most magnificent flowering\r\nplants in the world. _Disa Buchenaviana_, _Commelina madagascarica_, and\r\n_Tachiadenus platypterus_ are fine blue-flowered plants, while the superb\r\norchid _Angraecum sesquipedale_, _Vinca rosea_, _Euphorbia splendens_, and\r\n_Stephanotis floribunda_, have been long cultivated in our hot-houses.\r\nThere are also many handsome Combretaceae, Rubiaceae, and Leguminosae; but,\r\nas in most tropical regions, this wealth of floral beauty has to be\r\nsearched for, and produces little effect in the landscape.\r\n\r\nThe affinities of the Madagascar flora are to a great extent in accordance\r\nwith those of the fauna. The tropical portion of the flora agrees closely\r\nwith that of tropical Africa, while the plants of the highlands are {441}\r\nequally allied to those of the Cape and of the mountains of Central Africa.\r\nSome Asiatic types are present which do not occur in Africa; and even the\r\ncurious American affinities of some of the animals are reproduced in the\r\nvegetable kingdom. These last are so interesting that they deserve to be\r\nenumerated. An American genus of Euphorbiaceae, Omphalea, has one species\r\nin Madagascar, and Pedilanthus, another genus of the same natural order,\r\nhas a similar distribution. Myrosma, an American genus of Scitamineae has\r\none Madagascar species; while the celebrated \"travellers' tree,\" _Ravenala\r\nmadagascariensis_, belonging to the order Musaceae, has its nearest ally in\r\na plant inhabiting N. Brazil and Guiana. Echinolaena, a genus of grasses,\r\nhas the same distribution.[113]\r\n\r\nOf the flora of the smaller Madagascarian islands we possess a fuller\r\naccount, owing to the recent publication of Mr. Baker's _Flora of the\r\nMauritius and the Seychelles_, including also Rodriguez. The total number\r\nof species in this flora is 1,058, more than half of which (536) are\r\nexclusively Mascarene--that is, found only in some of the islands of the\r\nMadagascar group, while nearly a third (304) are endemic or confined to\r\nsingle islands. Of the widespread plants sixty-six are found in Africa but\r\nnot in Asia, and eighty-six in Asia but not in Africa, showing a similar\r\nAsiatic preponderance to what is said to occur in Madagascar. With the\r\ngenera, however, the proportions are different, for I find by going through\r\nthe whole of the generic distributions as given by Mr. Baker, that out of\r\nthe 440 genera of wild plants fifty are endemic, twenty-two are Asiatic but\r\nnot African, while twenty-eight are African but not Asiatic. This implies\r\nthat the more ancient connection has been on the side of Africa, while a\r\nmore recent immigration, shown by identity of species, has come from the\r\nside of Asia; and it is already certain that when the flora of Madagascar\r\nis more thoroughly worked out, a still greater African preponderance will\r\nbe found in that island.\r\n\r\n{442}\r\n\r\nA few Mascarene genera are found elsewhere only in South America,\r\nAustralia, or Polynesia; and there are also a considerable number of genera\r\nwhose metropolis is South America, but which are represented by one or more\r\nspecies in Madagascar, and by a single often widely distributed species in\r\nAfrica. This fact throws light upon the problem offered by those mammals,\r\nreptiles, and insects of Madagascar which now have their only allies in\r\nSouth America, since the two cases would be exactly parallel were the\r\nAfrican plants to become extinct. Plants, however, are undoubtedly more\r\nlong-lived specifically than animals--especially the more highly organised\r\ngroups, and are less liable to complete extinction through the attacks of\r\nenemies or through changes of climate or of physical geography; hence we\r\nfind comparatively few cases in which groups of Madagascar plants have\r\ntheir _only_ allies in such distant regions as America and Australia, while\r\nsuch cases are numerous among animals, owing to the extinction of the\r\nallied forms in intervening areas, for which extinction, as we have already\r\nshown, ample cause can be assigned.\r\n\r\n_Curious Relations of Mascarene Plants._--Among the curious affinities of\r\nMascarene plants we have culled the following from Mr. Baker's volume.\r\nTrochetia, a genus of Sterculiaceae, has four species in Mauritius, one in\r\nMadagascar, and one in the remote island of St. Helena. Mathurina, a genus\r\nof Turneraceae, consisting of a single species peculiar to Rodriguez, has\r\nits nearest ally in another monotypic genus, Erblichia, confined to Central\r\nAmerica. Siegesbeckia, one of the Compositae, consists of two species, one\r\ninhabiting the Mascarene islands, the other Peru. Labourdonasia, a genus of\r\nSapotaceae, has two species in Mauritius, one in Natal, and one in Cuba.\r\nNesogenes, belonging to the verbena family, has one species in Rodriguez\r\nand one in Polynesia. Mespilodaphne, an extensive genus of Lauraceae, has\r\nsix species in the Mascarene islands, and all the rest (about fifty\r\nspecies) in South America. Nepenthes, the well-known pitcher plants, are\r\nfound chiefly in the Malay Islands, South China, and Ceylon, with species\r\nin the Seychelles Islands, {443} and in Madagascar. Milla, a large genus of\r\nLiliaceae, is exclusively American, except one species found in Mauritius\r\nand Bourbon. Agauria, a genus of Ericaceae, is found in Madagascar, the\r\nMascarene islands, the plateau of Central Africa, and the Camaroon\r\nMountains in West Africa. An acacia, found in Mauritius and Bourbon (_A.\r\nheterophylla_), can hardly be separated specifically from _Acacia koa_ of\r\nthe Sandwich Islands. The genus Pandanus, or screw-pine, has sixteen\r\nspecies in the three islands--Mauritius, Rodriguez, and the Seychelles--all\r\nbeing peculiar, and none ranging beyond a single island. Of palms there are\r\nfifteen species belonging to ten genera, and all these genera are peculiar\r\nto the islands. We have here ample evidence that plants exhibit the same\r\nanomalies of distribution in these islands as do the animals, though in a\r\nsmaller proportion; while they also exhibit some of the transitional stages\r\nby which these anomalies have, in all probability, been brought about,\r\nrendering quite unnecessary any other changes in the distribution of sea\r\nand land than physical and geological evidence warrants.[114]\r\n\r\n{444}\r\n\r\n_Fragmentary Character of the Mascarene Flora._--Although the peculiar\r\ncharacter and affinities of the vegetation of these islands is sufficiently\r\napparent, there can be little doubt that we only possess a fragment of the\r\nrich flora which once adorned them. The cultivation of sugar, and other\r\ntropical products, has led to the clearing away of the virgin forests from\r\nall the lowlands, plateaus, and accessible slopes of the mountains, so that\r\nremains of the aboriginal woodlands only linger in the recesses of the\r\nhills, and numbers of forest-haunting plants must inevitably have been\r\nexterminated. The result is, that nearly three hundred species of foreign\r\nplants have run wild in Mauritius, and have in their turn helped to\r\nextinguish the native {445} species. In the Seychelles, too, the indigenous\r\nflora has been almost entirely destroyed in most of the islands, although\r\nthe peculiar palms, from their longevity and comparative hardiness, have\r\nsurvived. Mr. Geoffrey Nevill tells us, that at Mahe, and most of the other\r\nislands visited by him, it was only in a few spots near the summits of the\r\nhills that he could perceive any remains of the ancient flora. Pine-apples,\r\ncinnamon, bamboos, and other plants have obtained a firm footing, covering\r\nlarge tracts of country and killing the more delicate native flowers and\r\nferns. The pine-apple, especially, grows almost to the tops of the\r\nmountains. Where the timber and shrubs have been destroyed, the water\r\nfalling on the surface immediately cuts channels, runs off rapidly, and\r\ncauses the land to become dry and arid; and the same effect is largely seen\r\nboth in Mauritius and Bourbon, where, originally, dense forest covered the\r\nentire surface, and perennial moisture, with its ever-accompanying\r\nluxuriance of vegetation, prevailed.\r\n\r\n_Flora of Madagascar Allied to that of South Africa._--In my _Geographical\r\nDistribution of Animals_ I have remarked on the relation between the\r\ninsects of Madagascar and those of south temperate Africa, and have\r\nspeculated on a great _southern_ extension of the continent at the time\r\nwhen Madagascar was united with it. As supporting this view I now quote Mr.\r\nBentham's remarks on the Compositae. He says: \"The connections of the\r\nMascarene endemic Compositae, especially those of Madagascar itself, are\r\neminently with the southern and sub-tropical African races; the more\r\ntropical races, Plucheineae, &c., may be rather more of an Asiatic type.\"\r\nHe further says that the Composite flora is almost as strictly endemic as\r\nthat of the Sandwich Islands, and that it is much diversified, with\r\nevidences of great antiquity, while it shows insular characteristics in the\r\ntendency to tall shrubby or arborescent forms in several of the endemic or\r\nprevailing genera.\r\n\r\n_Preponderance of Ferns in the Mascarene Flora._--A striking character of\r\nthe flora of these smaller Mascarene islands is the great preponderance of\r\nferns, and next to them of orchideae. The following figures are taken from\r\n{446} Mr. Baker's _Flora_ for Mauritius and the Seychelles, and from an\r\nestimate by M. Frappier of the flora of Bourbon given in Maillard's volume\r\nalready quoted:--\r\n\r\n  _Mauritius, &c._             _Bourbon._\r\n\r\n  Ferns         168             Ferns         240\r\n  Orchideae      79             Orchideae     120\r\n  Gramineae      69             Gramineae      60\r\n  Cyperaceae     62             Compositae     60\r\n  Rubiaceae      57             Leguminosae    36\r\n  Euphorbiaceae  45             Rubiaceae      24\r\n  Compositae     43             Cyperaceae     24\r\n  Leguminosae    41             Euphorbiaceae  18\r\n\r\nThe cause of the great preponderance of ferns in oceanic islands has\r\nalready been discussed in my book on _Tropical Nature_; and we have seen\r\nthat Mauritius, Bourbon, and Rodriguez must be classed as such, though from\r\ntheir proximity to Madagascar they have to be considered as satellites to\r\nthat great island. The abundance of orchids, the reverse of what occurs in\r\nremoter oceanic islands, may be in part due to analogous causes. Their\r\nusually minute and abundant seeds would be as easily carried by the wind as\r\nthe spores of ferns, and their frequent epiphytic habit affords them an\r\nendless variety of stations on which to vegetate, and at the same time\r\nremoves them in a great measure from the competition of other plants. When,\r\ntherefore, the climate is sufficiently moist and equable, and there is a\r\nluxuriant forest vegetation, we may expect to find orchids plentiful on\r\nsuch tropical islands as possess an abundance of insects adapted to\r\nfertilise them, and which are not too far removed from other lands or\r\ncontinents from which their seeds might be conveyed.\r\n\r\n_Concluding Remarks on Madagascar and the Mascarene Islands._--There is\r\nprobably no portion of the globe that contains within itself so many and\r\nsuch varied features of interest connected with geographical distribution,\r\nor which so well illustrates the mode of solving the problems it presents,\r\nas the comparatively small insular region which comprises the great island\r\nof Madagascar and the smaller islands and island-groups which immediately\r\nsurround it. In Madagascar we have a continental island of the first rank,\r\nand undoubtedly of immense antiquity; we have detached fragments of this\r\nisland in the Comoros and {447} Aldabra; in the Seychelles we have the\r\nfragments of another very ancient island, which may perhaps never have been\r\ncontinental; in Mauritius, Bourbon, and Rodriguez we have three undoubtedly\r\noceanic islands; while in the extensive banks and coral reefs of Cargados,\r\nSaya de Malha, the Chagos, and the Maldive Isles, we have indications of\r\nthe submergence of many large islands which may have aided in the\r\ntransmission of organisms from the Indian Peninsula. But between and around\r\nall these islands we have depths of 2,500 fathoms and upwards, which\r\nrenders it very improbable that there has ever been here a continuous land\r\nsurface, at all events during the Tertiary or Secondary periods of geology.\r\n\r\nIt is most interesting and satisfactory to find that this conclusion,\r\narrived at solely by a study of the form of the sea-bottom and the general\r\nprinciple of oceanic permanence, is fully supported by the evidence of the\r\norganic productions of the several islands; because it gives us confidence\r\nin those principles, and helps to supply us with a practical demonstration\r\nof them. We find that the entire group contains just that amount of Indian\r\nforms which could well have passed from island to island; that many of\r\nthese forms are slightly modified species, indicating that the migration\r\noccurred during late Tertiary times, while others are distinct genera,\r\nindicating a more ancient connection; but in no one case do we find animals\r\nwhich necessitate an actual land-connection, while the numerous Indian\r\ntypes of mammalia, reptiles, birds, and insects, which must certainly have\r\npassed over had there been such an actual land-connection, are totally\r\nwanting. The one fact which has been supposed to require such a\r\nconnection--the distribution of the lemurs--can be far more naturally\r\nexplained by a general dispersion of the group from Europe, where we know\r\nit existed in Eocene times; and such an explanation applies equally to the\r\naffinity of the Insectivora of Madagascar and Cuba; the snakes\r\n(Herpetodryas, &c.) of Madagascar and America; and the lizards\r\n(Cryptoblepharus) of Mauritius and Australia. To suppose, in all these\r\ncases, and in many others, a direct land-connection, is really absurd,\r\nbecause {448} we have the evidence afforded by geology of wide differences\r\nof distribution directly we pass beyond the most recent deposits; and when\r\nwe go back to Mesozoic--and still more to Palaeozoic--times, the majority\r\nof the groups of animals and plants appear to have had a world-wide range.\r\nA large number of our European Miocene genera of vertebrates were also\r\nIndian or African, or even American; the South American Tertiary fauna\r\ncontained many European types; while many Mesozoic reptiles and mollusca\r\nranged from Europe and North America to Australia and New Zealand.\r\n\r\nBy very good evidence (the occurrence of wide areas of marine deposits of\r\nEocene age), geologists have established the fact that Africa was cut off\r\nfrom Europe and Asia by an arm of the sea in early Tertiary times, forming\r\na large island-continent. By the evidence of abundant organic remains we\r\nknow that all the types of large mammalia now found in Africa (but which\r\nare absent from Madagascar) inhabited Europe and Asia, and many of them\r\nalso North America, in the Miocene period. At a still earlier epoch Africa\r\nmay have received its lower types of mammals--lemurs, insectivora, and\r\nsmall carnivora, together with its ancestral struthious birds, and its\r\nreptiles and insects of American or Australian affinity; and at this period\r\nit was joined to Madagascar. Before the later continental period of Africa,\r\nMadagascar had become an island; and thus, when the large mammalia from the\r\nnorthern continent overran Africa, they were prevented from reaching\r\nMadagascar, which thenceforth was enabled to develop its singular forms of\r\nlow-type mammalia, its gigantic ostrich-like Aepyornis, its isolated birds,\r\nits remarkable insects, and its rich and peculiar flora. From it the\r\nadjacent islands received such organisms as could cross the sea; while they\r\ntransmitted to Madagascar some of the Indian birds and insects which had\r\nreached them.\r\n\r\nThe method we have followed in these investigations is to accept the\r\nresults of geological and palaeontological science, and the ascertained\r\nfacts as to the powers of dispersal of the various animal groups; to take\r\nfull account of the laws of evolution as affecting distribution, {449} and\r\nof the various ocean depths as implying recent or remote union of islands\r\nwith their adjacent continents; and the result is, that wherever we possess\r\na sufficient knowledge of these various classes of evidence, we find it\r\npossible to give a connected and intelligible explanation of all the most\r\nstriking peculiarities of the organic world. In Madagascar we have\r\nundoubtedly one of the most difficult of these problems; but we have, I\r\nthink, fairly met and conquered most of its difficulties. The complexity of\r\nthe organic relations of this island is due, partly to its having derived\r\nits animal forms from two distinct sources--from one continent through a\r\ndirect land-connection, and from another by means of intervening islands\r\nnow submerged; but, mainly to the fact of its having been separated from a\r\ncontinent which is now, zoologically, in a very different condition from\r\nthat which prevailed at the time of the separation; and to its having been\r\nthus able to preserve a number of types which may date back to the Eocene,\r\nor even to the Cretaceous, period. Some of these types have become\r\naltogether extinct elsewhere; others have spread far and wide over the\r\nglobe, and have survived only in a few remote countries--and especially in\r\nthose which have been more or less secured by their isolated position from\r\nthe incursions of the more highly-developed forms of later times. This\r\nexplains why it is that the nearest allies of the Madagascar fauna and\r\nflora are now so often to be found in South America or Australia--countries\r\nin which low forms of mammalia and birds still largely prevail;--it being\r\non account of the long-continued isolation of all these countries that\r\nsimilar forms (descendants of ancient types) are preserved in them. Had the\r\nnumerous suggested continental extensions connecting these remote\r\ncontinents at various geological periods been realities, the result would\r\nhave been that all these interesting archaic forms, all these defenceless\r\ninsular types, would long ago have been exterminated, and one comparatively\r\nmonotonous fauna have reigned over the whole earth. So far from explaining\r\nthe anomalous facts, the alleged continental extensions, had they existed,\r\nwould have left no such facts to be explained.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{450}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nANOMALOUS ISLANDS: CELEBES\r\n\r\n    Anomalous Relations of Celebes--Physical Features of the\r\n    Island--Zoological Character of the Islands Around Celebes--The Malayan\r\n    and Australian Banks--Zoology of Celebes: Mammalia--Probable Derivation\r\n    of the Mammals of Celebes--Birds of Celebes--Bird-types Peculiar to\r\n    Celebes--Celebes not Strictly a Continental Island--Peculiarities of\r\n    the Insects of Celebes--Himalayan Types of Birds and Butterflies in\r\n    Celebes--Peculiarities of Shape and Colour of Celebesian\r\n    Butterflies--Concluding Remarks--Appendix on the Birds of Celebes.\r\n\r\nThe only other islands of the globe which can be classed as \"ancient\r\ncontinental\" are the larger Antilles (Cuba, Haiti, Jamaica, and Porto\r\nRico), Iceland, and perhaps Celebes. The Antilles have been so fully\r\ndiscussed and illustrated in my former work, and there is so little fresh\r\ninformation about them, that I do not propose to treat of them here,\r\nespecially as they fall short of Madagascar in all points of biological\r\ninterest, and offer no problems of a different character from such as have\r\nalready been sufficiently explained.\r\n\r\nIceland, also, must apparently be classed as belonging to the \"Ancient\r\nContinental Islands,\" for though usually described as wholly volcanic, it\r\nis, more probably, an island of varied geological structure buried under\r\nthe lavas of its numerous volcanoes. But of late years extensive Tertiary\r\ndeposits of Miocene age have been discovered, showing that it is not a mere\r\ncongeries of {451} volcanoes; it is connected with the British Islands and\r\nwith Greenland by seas less than 500 fathoms deep; and it possesses a few\r\nmammalia, one of which is peculiar, and at least three peculiar species of\r\nbirds. It was therefore almost certainly united with Greenland, and\r\nprobably with Europe by way of Britain, in the early part of the Tertiary\r\nperiod, and thus afforded one of the routes by which that intermigration of\r\nAmerican and European animals and plants was effected which we know\r\noccurred during some portion of the Eocene and Miocene periods, and\r\nprobably also in the Pliocene. The fauna and flora of this island are,\r\nhowever, so poor, and offer so few peculiarities, that it is unnecessary to\r\ndevote more time to their consideration.\r\n\r\nThere remains the great Malay island--Celebes, which, owing to its\r\npossession of several large and very peculiar mammalia, must be classed,\r\nzoologically, as \"ancient continental\"; but whose central position and\r\nrelations both to Asia and to Australia render it very difficult to decide\r\nin which of the primary zoological regions it ought to be placed, or\r\nwhether it has ever been united with either of the great continents.\r\nAlthough I have pretty fully discussed its zoological peculiarities and\r\npast history in my _Geographical Distribution of Animals_, it seems\r\nadvisable to review the facts on the present occasion, more especially as\r\nthe systematic investigation of the characteristics of continental islands\r\nwe have now made will place us in a better position for determining its\r\ntrue zoo-geographical relations.\r\n\r\n_Physical Features of Celebes._--This large and still comparatively\r\nunexplored island is interesting to the geographer on account of its\r\nremarkable outline, but much more so to the zoologist for its curious\r\nassemblage of animal forms. The geological structure of Celebes is almost\r\nunknown. The extremity of the northern peninsula is volcanic; while in the\r\nsouthern peninsula there are extensive deposits of a crystalline limestone,\r\nin some places overlying basalt. Gold is found in the northern peninsula\r\nand in the central mass, as well as iron, tin, and copper in small\r\nquantities; so that there can be little {452} doubt that the mountain\r\nranges of the interior consist of ancient stratified rocks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP OF CELEBES AND THE SURROUNDING ISLANDS.\r\n\r\nThe depth of sea is shown by three tints: the lightest indicating less than\r\n100 fathoms, the medium tint less than 1,000 fathoms, and the dark tint\r\nmore than 1,000 fathoms. The figures show depths in fathoms.]\r\n\r\nIt is not yet known whether Celebes is completely separated from the\r\nsurrounding islands by a deep sea, but {453} the facts at our command\r\nrender it probable that it is so. The northern and eastern portions of the\r\nCelebes Sea have been ascertained to be from 2,000 to 2,600 fathoms deep,\r\nand such depths may extend over a considerable portion of it, or even be\r\nmuch exceeded in the centre. In the Molucca passage a single sounding on\r\nthe Gilolo side gave 1,200 fathoms, and a large part of the Molucca and\r\nBanda Seas probably exceed 2,000 fathoms. The southern portion of the\r\nStraits of Macassar is full of coral reefs, and a shallow sea of less than\r\n100 fathoms extends from Borneo to within about forty miles of the western\r\npromontory of Celebes; but farther north there is deep water close to the\r\nshore, and it seems probable that a deep channel extends quite through the\r\nstraits, which have no doubt been much shallowed by the deposits from the\r\ngreat Bornean rivers as well as by those of Celebes itself. Southward\r\nagain, the chain of volcanic islands from Bali to Timor appears to rise out\r\nof a deep ocean, the few soundings we possess showing depths of from 670 to\r\n1,300 fathoms almost close to their northern shores. We seem justified,\r\ntherefore, in concluding that Celebes is entirely surrounded by a deep sea,\r\nwhich has, however, become partially filled up by river deposits, by\r\nvolcanic upheaval, or by coral reefs. Such shallows, where they exist, may\r\ntherefore be due to antiquity and isolation, instead of being indications\r\nof a former union with any of the surrounding islands.\r\n\r\n_Zoological Character of the Islands around Celebes._--In order to have a\r\nclear conception of the peculiar character of the Celebesian fauna, we must\r\ntake into account that of the surrounding countries from which we may\r\nsuppose it to have received immigrants. These we may divide broadly into\r\ntwo groups, those on the west belonging to the Oriental region of our\r\nzoological geography, and those on the east belonging to the Australian\r\nregion. Of the first group Borneo is a typical representative; and from its\r\nproximity and the extent of its opposing coasts it is the island which we\r\nshould expect to show most resemblance to Celebes. We have already seen\r\nthat the fauna of Borneo is essentially the same as that of Southern Asia,\r\nand that it is excessively rich in all the Malayan types of {454} mammalia\r\nand birds. Java and Bali closely resemble Borneo in general character,\r\nthough somewhat less rich and with several peculiar forms; while the\r\nPhilippine Islands, though very much poorer, and with a greater amount of\r\nspeciality, yet exhibit essentially the same character. These islands,\r\ntaken as a whole, may be described as having a fauna almost identical with\r\nthat of Southern Asia; for no family of mammalia is found in the one which\r\nis absent from the other, and the same may be said, with very few and\r\nunimportant exceptions, of the birds; while hundreds of genera and of\r\nspecies are common to both.\r\n\r\nIn the islands east and south of Celebes--the Moluccas, New Guinea, and the\r\nTimor group from Lombok eastward--we find, on the other hand, the most\r\nwonderful contrast in the forms of life. Of twenty-seven families of\r\nterrestrial mammals found in the great Malay islands, all have disappeared\r\nbut four, and of these it is doubtful whether two have not been introduced\r\nby man. We also find here four families of Marsupials, all totally unknown\r\nin the western islands. Even birds, though usually more widely spread, show\r\na corresponding difference, about eleven Malayan families being quite\r\nunknown east of Celebes, where six new families make their appearance which\r\nare equally unknown to the westward.[115]\r\n\r\nWe have here a radical difference between two sets of islands not very far\r\nremoved from each other, the one set belonging zoologically to Asia, the\r\nother to Australia. The Asiatic or Malayan group is found to be bounded\r\nstrictly by the eastward limits of the great bank (for the most part less\r\nthan fifty fathoms below the surface) which {455} stretches out from the\r\nSiamese and Malayan peninsula as far as Java, Sumatra, Borneo, and the\r\nPhilippines. To the east another bank unites New Guinea and the Papuan\r\nIslands as far as Aru, Mysol, and Waigiou, with Australia; while the\r\nMoluccas and Timor groups are surrounded by much deeper water, which forms,\r\nin the Banda and Celebes Seas and perhaps in other parts of this area,\r\ngreat basins of enormous depths (2,000 to 3,000 fathoms or even more)\r\nenclosed by tracts under a thousand fathoms, which separate the basins from\r\neach other and from the adjacent Pacific and Indian Oceans (see map). This\r\npeculiar formation of the sea-bottom probably indicates that this area has\r\nbeen the seat of great local upheavals and subsidences; and it is quite in\r\naccordance with this view that we find the Moluccas, while closely agreeing\r\nwith New Guinea in their forms of life, yet strikingly deficient in many\r\nimportant groups, and exhibiting an altogether poverty-stricken appearance\r\nas regards the higher animals. It is a suggestive fact that the Philippine\r\nIslands bear an exactly parallel relation to Borneo, being equally\r\ndeficient in many of the higher groups; and here too, in the Sooloo Sea, we\r\nfind a similar enclosed basin of great depth. Hence we may in both cases\r\nconnect, on the one hand, the extensive area of land-surface and of\r\nadjacent shallow sea with a long period of stability and a consequent rich\r\ndevelopment of the forms of life; and, on the other hand, a highly broken\r\nland-surface with the adjacent seas of great but very unequal depths, with\r\na period of disturbance, probably involving extensive submersions of the\r\nland, resulting in a scanty and fragmentary vertebrate fauna.\r\n\r\n_Zoology of Celebes._--The zoology of Celebes differs so remarkably from\r\nthat of both the great divisions of the Archipelago above indicated, that\r\nit is very difficult to decide in which to place it. It possesses only\r\nabout sixteen species of terrestrial mammalia, so that it is at once\r\ndistinguished from Borneo and Java by its extreme poverty in this class. Of\r\nthis small number four belong to the Moluccan and Australian fauna--there\r\nbeing two marsupials of the genus Cuscus, and two forest rats said to be\r\nallied to Australian types. {456}\r\n\r\nThe remaining twelve species are, generally speaking, of Malayan or Asiatic\r\ntypes, but some of them are so peculiar that they have no near allies in\r\nany part of the world; while the rest are of the ordinary Malay type or\r\neven identical with Malayan species, and some of these may be recent\r\nintroductions through human agency. These twelve species of Asiatic type\r\nwill be now enumerated. They consist of five peculiar squirrels--a group\r\nunknown farther east; a peculiar species of wild pig; a deer so closely\r\nallied to the _Cervus hippelaphus_ of Borneo that it may well have been\r\nintroduced by man both here and in the Moluccas; a civet, _Viverra\r\ntangalunga_, common in all the Malay Islands, and also perhaps introduced;\r\nthe curious Malayan tarsier (_Tarsius spectrum_) said to be only found in a\r\nsmall island off the coast;--and besides these, three remarkable animals,\r\nall of large size and all quite unlike anything found in the Malay Islands\r\nor even in Asia. These are a black and almost tailless baboon-like ape\r\n(_Cynopithecus nigrescens_); an antelopean buffalo (_Anoa depressicornis_),\r\nand the strange babirusa (_Babirusa alfurus_).\r\n\r\nNone of these three animals last mentioned has any close allies elsewhere,\r\nand their presence in Celebes may be considered the crucial fact which must\r\ngive us the clue to the past history of the island. Let us then see what\r\nthey teach us. The ape is apparently somewhat intermediate between the\r\ngreat baboons of Africa and the short-tailed macaques of Asia, but its\r\ncranium shows a nearer approach to the former group, in its flat projecting\r\nmuzzle, large superciliary crests, and maxillary ridges. The anoa, though\r\nanatomically allied to the buffaloes, externally more resembles the bovine\r\nantelopes of Africa; while the babirusa is altogether unlike any other\r\nliving member of the swine family, the canines of the upper jaws growing\r\ndirectly upwards like horns, forming a spiral curve over the eyes, instead\r\nof downwards, as in all other mammalia. An approach to this peculiarity is\r\nmade by the African wart-hogs, in which the upper tusk grows out laterally\r\nand then curves up; but these animals are not otherwise closely allied to\r\nthe babirusa. {457}\r\n\r\n_Probable Derivation of the Mammals of Celebes._--It is clear that we have\r\nhere a group of extremely peculiar, and, in all probability, very ancient\r\nforms, which have been preserved to us by isolation in Celebes, just as the\r\nmonotremes and marsupials have been preserved in Australia, and so many of\r\nthe lemurs and Insectivora in Madagascar. And this compels us to look upon\r\nthe existing island as a fragment of some ancient land, once perhaps\r\nforming part of the great northern continent, but separated from it far\r\nearlier than Borneo, Sumatra, and Java. The exceeding scantiness of the\r\nmammalian fauna, however, remains to be accounted for. We have seen that\r\nFormosa, a much smaller island, contains more than twice as many species;\r\nand we may be sure that at the time when such animals as apes and buffaloes\r\nexisted, the Asiatic continent swarmed with varied forms of mammals to\r\nquite as great an extent as Borneo does now. If the portion of separated\r\nland had been anything like as large as Celebes now is, it would certainly\r\nhave preserved a far more abundant and varied fauna. To explain the facts\r\nwe have the choice of two theories:--either that the original island has\r\nsince its separation been greatly reduced by submersion, so as to lead to\r\nthe extinction of most of the higher land animals; or, that it originally\r\nformed part of an independent land stretching eastward, and was only united\r\nwith the Asiatic continent for a short period, or perhaps even never united\r\nat all, but so connected by intervening islands separated by narrow straits\r\nthat a few mammals might find their way across. The latter supposition\r\nappears best to explain the facts. The three animals in question are such\r\nas might readily pass over narrow straits from island to island; and we are\r\nthus better enabled to understand the complete absence of the arboreal\r\nmonkeys, of the Insectivora, and of the very numerous and varied Carnivora\r\nand Rodents of Borneo, all of which except the squirrels are entirely\r\nunrepresented in Celebes by any peculiar and ancient forms.\r\n\r\nThe question at issue can only be finally determined by geological\r\ninvestigations. If Celebes has once formed part of Asia, and participated\r\nin its rich mammalian fauna, which has been since destroyed by submergence,\r\nthen some {458} remains of this fauna must certainly be preserved in caves\r\nor late Tertiary deposits, and proofs of the submergence itself will be\r\nfound when sought for. If, on the other hand, the existing animals fairly\r\nrepresent those which have ever reached the island, then no such remains\r\nwill be discovered, and there need be no evidence of any great and\r\nextensive subsidence in late Tertiary times.\r\n\r\n_Birds of Celebes._--Having thus clearly placed before us the problem\r\npresented by the mammalian fauna of Celebes, we may proceed to see what\r\nadditional evidence is afforded by the birds and any other groups of which\r\nwe have sufficient information. About 164 species of true land-birds are\r\nnow known to inhabit the island of Celebes itself. Considerably more than\r\nhalf of these (ninety-four species) are peculiar to it; twenty-nine are\r\nfound also in Borneo and the other Malay Islands, to which they specially\r\nbelong; while sixteen are common to the Moluccas or other islands of the\r\nAustralian region; the remainder being species of wide range and not\r\ncharacteristic of either division of the Archipelago. We have here a large\r\npreponderance of western over eastern species of birds inhabiting Celebes,\r\nthough not to quite so great an extent as in the mammalia; and the\r\ninference to be drawn from this fact is, simply, that more birds have\r\nmigrated from Borneo than from the Moluccas--which is exactly what we might\r\nexpect both from the greater extent of the coast of Borneo opposite that of\r\nCelebes, and also from the much greater richness in species of the Bornean\r\nthan the Moluccan bird-fauna.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, to the relations of the peculiar species of Celebesian\r\nbirds that we must turn, in order to ascertain the origin of the fauna in\r\npast times; and we must look to the source of the generic types which they\r\nrepresent to give us this information. The ninety-four peculiar species\r\nabove noted belong to about sixty-six genera, of which about twenty-three\r\nare common to the whole Archipelago, and have therefore little\r\nsignificance. Of the remainder, twelve are altogether peculiar to Celebes;\r\ntwenty-one are Malayan, but not Moluccan or Australian; while ten are\r\nMoluccan or Australian, but not Malayan. This {459} proportion does not\r\ndiffer much from that afforded by the non-peculiar species; and it teaches\r\nus that, for a considerable period, Celebes has been receiving immigrants\r\nfrom all sides, many of which have had time to become modified into\r\ndistinct representative species. These evidently belong to the period\r\nduring which Borneo on the one side, and the Moluccas on the other, have\r\noccupied very much the same relative position as now. There remain the\r\ntwelve peculiar Celebesian genera, to which we must look for some further\r\nclue as to the origin of the older portion of the fauna; and as these are\r\nespecially interesting we must examine them somewhat closely.\r\n\r\n_Bird-types Peculiar to Celebes._--First we have Artamides, one of the\r\nCampephaginae or caterpillar-shrikes--a not very well-marked genus, and\r\nwhich may have been derived, either from the Malayan or the Moluccan side\r\nof the Archipelago. Two peculiar genera of kingfishers--Monachalcyon and\r\nCittura--seem allied, the former to the widespread Todiramphus and to the\r\nCaridonax of Lombok, the latter to the Australian Melidora. Another\r\nkingfisher, Ceycopsis, combines the characters of the Malayan Ceyx and the\r\nAfrican Ispidina, and thus forms an example of an ancient generalised form\r\nanalogous to what occurs among the mammalia. Streptocitta is a peculiar\r\nform allied to the magpies; while Basilornis (found also in Ceram), Enodes,\r\nand Scissirostrum, are very peculiar starlings, the latter altogether\r\nunlike any other bird, and perhaps forming a distinct sub-family. Meropogon\r\nis a peculiar bee-eater, allied to the Malayan Nyctiornis; Rhamphococyx is\r\na modification of Phaenicophaes, a Malayan genus of cuckoos; Prioniturus\r\n(found also in the Philippines) is a genus of parrots distinguished by\r\nraquet-formed tail feathers, altogether unique in the order; while\r\nMegacephalon is a remarkable and very isolated form of the Australian\r\nMegapodiidae, or mound-builders.\r\n\r\nOmitting those whose affinity may be pretty clearly traced to groups still\r\ninhabiting the islands of the western or the eastern half of the\r\nArchipelago, we find four birds which have no near allies at all, but\r\nappear to be either ancestral forms, or extreme modifications, of Asiatic\r\nor {460} African birds--Basilornis, Enodes, Scissirostrum, Ceycopsis. These\r\nmay fairly be associated with the baboon-ape, anoa, and babirusa, as\r\nindicating extreme antiquity and some communication with the Asiatic\r\ncontinent at a period when the forms of life and their geographical\r\ndistribution differed considerably from what they are at the present time.\r\n\r\nBut here again we meet with exactly the same difficulty as in the mammalia,\r\nin the comparative poverty of the types of birds now inhabiting Celebes.\r\nAlthough the preponderance of affinity, especially in the case of its more\r\nancient and peculiar forms, is undoubtedly with Asia rather than with\r\nAustralia; yet, still more decidedly than in the case of the mammalia, are\r\nwe forbidden to suppose that it ever formed a part of the old Asiatic\r\ncontinent, on account of the _total_ absence of so many important and\r\nextensive groups of Asiatic birds. It is not single species or even genera,\r\nbut whole families that are thus absent, and among them families which are\r\npre-eminently characteristic of all tropical Asia. Such are the Timaliidae,\r\nor babblers, of which there are twelve genera in Borneo, and nearly thirty\r\ngenera in the Oriental Region, but of which one species only, hardly\r\ndistinguishable from a Malayan form, inhabits Celebes; the Phyllornithidae,\r\nor green bulbuls, and the Pycnonotidae, or bulbuls, both absolutely\r\nubiquitous in tropical Asia and Malaya, but unknown in Celebes; the\r\nEurylaemidae, or gapers, found everywhere in the great Malay Islands; the\r\nMegalaemidae, or barbets; the Trogonidae, or trogons; and the Phasianidae,\r\nor pheasants, all pre-eminently Asiatic and Malayan but all absent from\r\nCelebes, with the exception of the common jungle-fowl, which, owing to the\r\npassion of Malays for cock-fighting, may have been introduced. To these\r\nimportant _families_ may be added Asiatic and Malayan _genera_ by the\r\nscore; but, confining ourselves to these seven ubiquitous families, we must\r\nask,--Is it possible, that, at the period when the ancestors of the\r\npeculiar Celebes mammals entered the island, and when the forms of life,\r\nthough distinct, could not have been quite unlike those now living, it\r\ncould have actually formed a part of the continent without {461} possessing\r\nrepresentatives of the greater part of these extensive and important\r\nfamilies of birds? To get rid altogether of such varied and dominant types\r\nof bird-life by any subsequent process of submersion is more difficult than\r\nto exterminate mammalia; and we are therefore again driven to our former\r\nconclusion--that the present land of Celebes has never (in Tertiary times)\r\nbeen united to the Asiatic continent, but has received its population of\r\nAsiatic forms by migration across narrow straits and intervening islands.\r\nTaking into consideration the amount of affinity on the one hand, and the\r\nisolation on the other, of the Celebesian fauna, we may probably place the\r\nperiod of this earlier migration in the early part of the latter half of\r\nthe Tertiary period, that is, in middle or late Miocene times.\r\n\r\n_Celebes not Strictly a Continental Island._--A study of the mammalian and\r\nof the bird-fauna of Celebes thus leads us in both cases to the same\r\nconclusion, and forbids us to rank it as a strictly continental island on\r\nthe Asiatic side. But facts of a very similar character are equally opposed\r\nto the idea of a former land-connection with Australia or New Guinea, or\r\neven with the Moluccas. The numerous marsupials of those countries are all\r\nwanting in Celebes, except the phalangers of the genus Cuscus, and these\r\narboreal creatures are very liable to be carried across narrow seas on\r\ntrees uprooted by earthquakes or floods. The terrestrial cassowaries are\r\nequally absent; and thus we can account for the presence of all the\r\nMoluccan or Australian types actually found in Celebes without supposing\r\nany land-connection on this side during the Tertiary period. The presence\r\nof the Celebes ape in the island of Batchian, and of the babirusa in Bouru,\r\ncan be sufficiently explained by a somewhat closer approximation of the\r\nrespective lands, or by a few intervening islands which have since\r\ndisappeared, or it may even be due to human agency.\r\n\r\nIf the explanation now given of the peculiar features presented by the\r\nfauna of Celebes be the correct one, we are fully justified in classing it\r\nas an \"anomalous island,\" since it possesses a small but very remarkable\r\nmammalian fauna, without ever having been directly united with any {462}\r\ncontinent or extensive land; and, both by what it has and what it wants,\r\noccupies such an exactly intermediate position between the Oriental and\r\nAustralian regions that it will perhaps ever remain a mere matter of\r\nopinion with which it should properly be associated. Forming, as it does,\r\nthe western limit of such typical Australian groups as the Marsupials among\r\nmammalia, and the Trichoglossidae and Meliphagidae among birds, and being\r\nso strikingly deficient in all the more characteristic Oriental families\r\nand genera of both classes, I have always placed it in the Australian\r\nRegion; but it may perhaps with equal propriety be left out of both till a\r\nfurther knowledge of its geology enables us to determine its early history\r\nwith more precision.\r\n\r\n_Peculiarities of the Insects of Celebes._--The only other class of animals\r\nin Celebes, of which we have a tolerable knowledge, is that of insects,\r\namong which we meet with peculiarities of a very remarkable kind, and such\r\nas are found in no other island on the globe. Having already given a full\r\naccount of some of these peculiarities in a paper read before the Linnean\r\nSociety--republished in my _Contributions to the Theory of Natural\r\nSelection_,--while others have been discussed in my _Geographical\r\nDistribution of Animals_ (Vol. I. p. 434)--I will only here briefly refer\r\nto them in order to see whether they accord with, or receive any\r\nexplanation from, the somewhat novel view of the past history of the island\r\nhere advanced.\r\n\r\nThe general distribution of the two best known groups of insects--the\r\nbutterflies and the beetles--agrees very closely with that of the birds and\r\nmammalia, inasmuch as Celebes forms the eastern limit of a number of\r\nAsiatic and Malayan genera, and at the same time the western limit of\r\nseveral Moluccan and Australian genera, the former perhaps preponderating\r\nas in the higher animals.\r\n\r\n_Himalayan Types of Birds and Butterflies in Celebes._--A curious fact of\r\ndistribution exhibited both among butterflies and birds, is the occurrence\r\nin Celebes of species and genera unknown to the adjacent islands, but only\r\nfound again when we reach the Himalayan mountains or the Indian Peninsula.\r\nAmong birds we have a small yellow {463} flycatcher (_Myialestes\r\nhelianthea_), a flower-pecker (_Pachyglossa aureolimbata_), a finch (_Munia\r\nbrunneiceps_), and a roller (_Coracias temminckii_), all closely allied to\r\nIndian (not Malayan) species,--all the genera, except Munia, being, in\r\nfact, unknown in any Malay island. An exactly parallel case is that of a\r\nbutterfly of the genus Dichorrhagia, which has a very close ally in the\r\nHimalayas, but nothing like it in any intervening country. These facts call\r\nto mind the similar case of Formosa, where some of its birds and mammals\r\noccurred again, under identical or closely allied forms, in the Himalayas;\r\nand in both instances they can only be explained by going back to a period\r\nwhen the distribution of these forms was very different from what it is\r\nnow.\r\n\r\n_Peculiarities of Shape and Colour in Celebesian Butterflies._--Even more\r\nremarkable are the peculiarities of shape and colour in a number of\r\nCelebesian butterflies of different genera. These are found to vary all in\r\nthe same manner, indicating some general cause of variation able to act\r\nupon totally distinct groups, and produce upon them all a common result.\r\nNearly thirty species of butterflies, belonging to three different\r\nfamilies, have a common modification in the shape of their wings, by which\r\nthey can be distinguished at a glance from their allies in any other island\r\nor country whatever; and all these are larger than the representative forms\r\ninhabiting most of the adjacent islands.[116] No such remarkable local\r\nmodification as this is known to occur in any other part of the globe; and\r\nwhatever may have been its cause, that cause must certainly have been long\r\nin action, and have been confined to a limited area. We have here,\r\ntherefore, another argument in favour of the long-continued isolation of\r\nCelebes from all the surrounding islands and continents--a hypothesis which\r\nwe have seen to afford the best, if not the only, explanation of its\r\npeculiar vertebrate fauna.\r\n\r\n_Concluding Remarks._--If the view here given of the origin of the\r\nremarkable Celebesian fauna is correct, we have in this island a fragment\r\nof the great eastern {464} continent which has preserved to us, perhaps\r\nfrom Miocene times, some remnants of its ancient animal forms. There is no\r\nother example on the globe of an island so closely surrounded by other\r\nislands on every side, yet preserving such a marked individuality in its\r\nforms of life; while, as regards the special features which characterise\r\nits insects, it is, so far as yet known, absolutely unique. Unfortunately\r\nvery little is known of the botany of Celebes, but it seems probable that\r\nits plants will to some extent partake of the speciality which so markedly\r\ndistinguishes its animals; and there is here a rich field for any botanist\r\nwho is able to penetrate to the forest-clad mountains of its interior.\r\n{465}\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX TO CHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nThe following list of the Land Birds of Celebes and the adjacent islands\r\nwhich partake of its zoological peculiarities, in which are incorporated\r\nall the species discovered up to 1890, has been drawn up from the following\r\nsources:--\r\n\r\n    1.

The present work is, besides, addressed to a\r\nwider class of readers than my former volumes, and it would be manifestly\r\nincomplete if all reference to one of the most remarkable and interesting\r\nof insular faunas was omitted.\r\n\r\nThe two great islands which mainly constitute New Zealand are together\r\nabout as large as the kingdom of Italy. They stretch over thirteen degrees\r\nof latitude in the warmer portion of the south-temperate zone, their\r\nextreme points corresponding to the latitudes of Vienna and Cyprus. Their\r\nclimate throughout is mild and {472} equable, their vegetation is\r\nluxuriant, and deserts or uninhabitable regions are as completely unknown\r\nas in our own islands.\r\n\r\nThe geological structure of these islands has a decidedly continental\r\ncharacter. Ancient sedimentary rocks, granite, and modern volcanic\r\nformations abound; gold, silver, copper, tin, iron, and coal are plentiful;\r\nand there are also some considerable deposits of early or late Tertiary\r\nage. The Secondary rocks alone are very scantily developed, and such\r\nfragments as exist are chiefly of Cretaceous age, often not clearly\r\nseparated from the succeeding Eocene beds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP SHOWING DEPTHS OF SEA AROUND AUSTRALIA AND NEW ZEALAND.]\r\n\r\n  The light tint indicates a depth of less than 1,000 fathoms.\r\n  The dark tint      ,,        ,,     more than 1,000 fathoms.\r\n\r\nThe position of New Zealand, in the great Southern Ocean, about 1,200 miles\r\ndistant from the Australian {473} continent, is very isolated. It is\r\nsurrounded by a moderately deep ocean; but the form of the sea-bottom is\r\npeculiar, and may help us in the solution of some of the anomalies\r\npresented by its living productions. The line of 200 fathoms encloses the\r\ntwo islands and extends their area considerably; but the 1,000-fathom line,\r\nwhich indicates the land-area that would be produced if the sea-bottom were\r\nelevated 6,000 feet, has a very remarkable conformation, extending in a\r\nbroad mass westward and northward, then sending out a great arm reaching to\r\nbeyond Lord Howe's Island. Norfolk Island is situated on a moderate-sized\r\nbank, while two others, much more extensive, to the north-west approach the\r\ngreat barrier reef, which here carries the 1,000-fathom line more than 300\r\nmiles from the coast. It is probable that a bank, less than 1,500 fathoms\r\nbelow the surface, extends over this area, thus forming a connection with\r\ntropical Australia and New Guinea. Temperate Australia, on the other hand,\r\nis divided from New Zealand by an oceanic gulf about 700 miles wide and\r\nbetween 2,000 and 3,000 fathoms deep. The 2,000-fathom line embraces all\r\nthe islands immediately round New Zealand as far as the Fijis to the north,\r\nwhile a submarine plateau at a depth somewhere between one and two thousand\r\nfathoms stretches southward to the Antarctic continent. Judging from these\r\nindications, we should say that the most probable ancient connections of\r\nNew Zealand were with tropical Australia, New Caledonia, and the Fiji\r\nIslands, and perhaps at a still more remote epoch, with the great Southern\r\ncontinent by means of intervening lands and islands; and we shall find that\r\na land-connection or near approximation in these two directions, at remote\r\nperiods, will serve to explain many of the remarkable anomalies which these\r\nislands present.\r\n\r\n_Zoological Character of New Zealand._--We see, then, that both\r\ngeologically and geographically New Zealand has more of the character of a\r\n\"continental\" than of an \"oceanic\" island, yet its zoological\r\ncharacteristics are such as almost to bring it within the latter\r\ncategory--and it is this which gives it its anomalous character. It is\r\nusually {474} considered to possess no indigenous mammalia; it has no\r\nsnakes, and only one frog; it possesses (living or quite recently extinct)\r\nan extensive group of birds incapable of flight; and its productions\r\ngenerally are wonderfully isolated, and seem to bear no predominant or\r\nclose relation to those of Australia or any other continent. These are the\r\ncharacteristics of an oceanic island; and thus we find that the inferences\r\nfrom its physical structure and those from its forms of life directly\r\ncontradict each other. Let us see how far a closer examination of the\r\nlatter will enable us to account for this apparent contradiction.\r\n\r\n_Mammalia of New Zealand._--The only undoubtedly indigenous mammalia appear\r\nto be two species of bats, one of which (_Scotophilus tuberculatus_) is,\r\naccording to Mr. Dobson, identical with an Australian form, while the other\r\n(_Mystacina tuberculata_) forms a very remarkable and isolated genus of\r\nEmballonuridae, a family which extends throughout all the tropical regions\r\nof the globe. The genus Mystacina was formerly considered to belong to the\r\nAmerican Phyllostomidae, but this has been shown to be an error.[117] The\r\npoverty of New Zealand in bats is very remarkable when compared with our\r\nown islands where there are at least twelve distinct species, though we\r\nhave a far less favourable climate.\r\n\r\nOf the existence of truly indigenous land mammals in New Zealand there is\r\nat present no positive evidence, but there is some reason to believe that\r\none if not two species may be found there. The Maoris say that before\r\nEuropeans came to their country a forest-rat abounded and was largely used\r\nfor food. They believe that their ancestors brought it with them when they\r\nfirst came to the country; but it has now become almost, if not quite,\r\nexterminated by the European brown rat. What this native animal was is\r\nstill somewhat doubtful. Several specimens have been caught at different\r\ntimes which have been declared by the natives to be the true _Kiore\r\nMaori_--as they term it, but these have usually proved on examination to be\r\neither the European black rat or some of the native Australian rats which\r\nnow {475} often find their way on board ships. But within the last few\r\nyears many skulls of a rat have been obtained from the old Maori\r\ncooking-places, and from a cave associated with moa bones; and Captain\r\nHutton, who has examined them, states that they belong to a true Mus, but\r\ndiffer from the _Mus rattus_. This animal might have been on the islands\r\nwhen the Maoris first arrived, and in that case would be truly indigenous;\r\nwhile the Maori legend of their \"ancestors\" bringing the rat from their\r\nPolynesian home may be altogether a myth invented to account for its\r\npresence in the islands, because the only other land mammal which they\r\nknew--the dog--was certainly so brought. The question can only be settled\r\nby the discovery of remains of a rat in some deposit of an age decidedly\r\nanterior to the first arrival of the Maori race in New Zealand.[118]\r\n\r\nMuch more interesting is the reported existence in the mountains of the\r\nSouth Island of a small otter-like animal. Dr. Haast has seen its tracks,\r\nresembling those of our European otter, at a height of 3,000 feet above the\r\nsea in a region never before trodden by man; and the animal itself was seen\r\nby two gentlemen near Lake Heron, about seventy miles due west of\r\nChristchurch. It was described as being dark brown and the size of a large\r\nrabbit. On being struck at with a whip, it uttered a shrill yelping sound\r\nand disappeared in the water.[119] An animal seen so closely as to be\r\nstruck at with a whip could hardly have been mistaken for a dog--the only\r\nother animal that it could possibly be supposed to have been, and a dog\r\nwould certainly not have \"disappeared in the water.\" This account, as well\r\nas the footsteps, point to an aquatic animal; and if it now frequents only\r\nthe high alpine lakes and streams, this might explain why it has never yet\r\nbeen captured. Hochstetter also states that it has a native\r\nname--Waitoteke--a striking evidence of its actual existence, while a\r\ngentleman who lived many years in the district assures me that {476} it is\r\nuniversally believed in by residents in that part of New Zealand. The\r\nactual capture of this animal and the determination of its characters and\r\naffinities could not fail to aid us greatly in our speculations as to the\r\nnature and origin of the New Zealand fauna.[120]\r\n\r\n_Wingless Birds, Living and Extinct._--Almost equally valuable with\r\nmammalia in affording indications of geographical changes are the wingless\r\nbirds for which New Zealand is so remarkable. These consist of four species\r\nof Apteryx, called by the natives \"kiwis,\"--creatures which hardly look\r\nlike birds owing to the apparent absence (externally) of tail or wings and\r\nthe dense covering of hair-like feathers. They vary in size from that of a\r\nsmall fowl up to that of a turkey, and have a long slightly curved bill,\r\nsomewhat resembling that of the snipe or ibis. Two species appear to be\r\nconfined to the South Island, and one to the North Island, but all are\r\nbecoming scarce, and they will no doubt gradually become extinct. These\r\nbirds are generally classed with the Struthiones or ostrich tribe, but they\r\nform a distinct family, and in many respects differ greatly from all other\r\nknown birds.\r\n\r\nBut besides these, a number of other wingless birds, called \"moas,\"\r\ninhabited New Zealand during the period of human occupation, and have only\r\nrecently become extinct. These were much larger birds than the kiwis, and\r\nsome of them were even larger than the ostrich, a specimen {477} of\r\n_Dinornis maximus_ mounted in the British Museum in its natural attitude\r\nbeing eleven feet high. They agreed, however, with the living Apteryx in\r\nthe character of the pelvis and some other parts of the skeleton, while in\r\ntheir short bill and in some important structural features they resembled\r\nthe emu of Australia and the cassowaries of New Guinea.[121] No less than\r\neleven distinct species of these birds have now been discovered; and their\r\nremains exist in such abundance--in recent fluviatile deposits, in old\r\nnative cooking places, and even scattered on the surface of the\r\nground--that complete skeletons of several of them have been put together,\r\nillustrating various periods of growth from the chick up to the adult bird.\r\nFeathers have also been found attached to portions of the skin, as well as\r\nthe stones swallowed by the birds to assist digestion, and eggs, some\r\ncontaining portions of the embryo bird; so that everything confirms the\r\nstatements of the Maoris--that their ancestors found these birds in\r\nabundance on the islands, that they hunted them for food, and that they\r\nfinally exterminated them only a short time before the arrival of\r\nEuropeans.[122] Bones of Apteryx are also found fossil, but apparently of\r\nthe same species as the living birds. {478} How far back in geological time\r\nthese creatures or their ancestral types lived in New Zealand we have as\r\nyet no evidence to show. Some specimens have been found under a\r\nconsiderable depth of fluviatile deposits which may be of Quaternary or\r\neven of Pliocene age; but this evidently affords us no approximation to the\r\ntime required for the origin and development of such highly peculiar\r\ninsular forms.\r\n\r\n_Past Changes of New Zealand deduced from its Wingless Birds._--It has been\r\nwell observed by Captain Hutton, in his interesting paper already referred\r\nto, that the occurrence of such a number of species of Struthious birds\r\nliving together in so small a country as New Zealand is altogether\r\nunparalleled elsewhere on the globe. This is even more remarkable when we\r\nconsider that the species are not equally divided between the two islands,\r\nfor remains of no less than ten out of the eleven known species of Dinornis\r\nhave been found in a single swamp in the South Island, where also three of\r\nthe species of Apteryx occur. The New Zealand Struthiones, in fact, very\r\nnearly equal in number those of all the rest of the world, and nowhere else\r\ndo more than three species occur in any one continent or island, while no\r\nmore than two ever occur in the same district. Thus, there appear to be two\r\nclosely allied species of ostriches inhabiting Africa and South-western\r\nAsia respectively. South America has three species of Rhea, each in a\r\nseparate district. Australia has an eastern and a western variety of emu,\r\nand a cassowary in the north; while eight other cassowaries are known from\r\nthe islands north of Australia--one from Ceram, two from the Aru Islands,\r\none from Jobie, one from New Britain, and three from New Guinea--but of\r\nthese last one is confined to the northern and another to the southern part\r\nof the island.\r\n\r\nThis law, of the distribution of allied species in separate areas--which is\r\nfound to apply more or less accurately to all classes of animals--is so\r\nentirely opposed to the crowding together of no less that fifteen species\r\nof wingless birds in the small area of New Zealand, that the idea is at\r\nonce suggested of great geographical changes. Captain Hutton points out\r\nthat if the islands from Ceram to New Britain {479} were to become joined\r\ntogether, we should have a large number of species of cassowary (perhaps\r\nseveral more than are yet discovered) in one land area. If now this land\r\nwere gradually to be submerged, leaving a central elevated region, the\r\ndifferent species would become crowded together in this portion just as the\r\nmoas and kiwis were in New Zealand. But we also require, at some remote\r\nepoch, a more or less complete union of the islands now inhabited by the\r\nseparate species of cassowaries, in order that the common ancestral form\r\nwhich afterwards became modified into these species, could have reached the\r\nplaces where they are now found; and this gives us an idea of the complete\r\nseries of changes through which New Zealand is believed to have passed in\r\norder to bring about its abnormally dense population of wingless birds.\r\nFirst, we must suppose a land connection with some country inhabited by\r\nstruthious birds, from which the ancestral forms might be derived;\r\nsecondly, a separation into many considerable islands, in which the various\r\ndistinct species might become differentiated; thirdly, an elevation\r\nbringing about the union of these islands to unite the distinct species in\r\none area; and fourthly, a subsidence of a large part of the area, leaving\r\nthe present islands with the various species crowded together.\r\n\r\nIf New Zealand has really gone through such a series of changes as here\r\nsuggested, some proofs of it might perhaps be obtained in the outlying\r\nislands which were once, presumably, joined with it. And this gives great\r\nimportance to the statement of the aborigines of the Chatham Islands, that\r\nthe Apteryx formerly lived there but was exterminated about 1835. It is to\r\nbe hoped that some search will be made here and also in Norfolk Island, in\r\nboth of which it is not improbable remains either of Apteryx or Dinornis\r\nmight be discovered.\r\n\r\nSo far we find nothing to object to in the speculations of Captain Hutton,\r\nwith which, on the contrary, we almost wholly concur; but we cannot follow\r\nhim when he goes on to suggest an Antarctic continent uniting New Zealand\r\nand Australia with South America, and probably also with South Africa, in\r\norder to explain the existing distribution {480} of struthious birds. Our\r\nbest anatomists, as we have seen, agree that both Dinornis and Apteryx are\r\nmore nearly allied to the cassowaries and emus than to the ostriches and\r\nrheas; and we see that the form of the sea-bottom suggests a former\r\nconnection with North Australia and New Guinea--the very region where these\r\ntypes most abound, and where in all probability they originated. The\r\nsuggestion that all the struthious birds of the world sprang from a common\r\nancestor at no very remote period, and that their existing distribution is\r\ndue to direct land communication between the countries they _now_ inhabit,\r\nis one utterly opposed to all sound principles of reasoning in questions of\r\ngeographical distribution. For it depends upon two assumptions, both of\r\nwhich are at least doubtful, if not certainly false--the first, that their\r\ndistribution over the globe has never in past ages been very different from\r\nwhat it is now; and the second, that the ancestral forms of these birds\r\nnever had the power of flight. As to the first assumption, we have found in\r\nalmost every case that groups now scattered over two or more continents\r\nformerly lived in intervening areas of existing land. Thus the marsupials\r\nof South America and Australia are connected by forms which lived in North\r\nAmerica and Europe; the camels of Asia and the llamas of the Andes had many\r\nextinct common ancestors in North America; the lemurs of Africa and Asia\r\nhad their ancestors in Europe, as had the trogons of South America, Africa,\r\nand tropical Asia. But besides this general evidence we have direct proof\r\nthat the struthious birds had a wider range in past times than now. Remains\r\nof extinct rheas have been found in Central Brazil, and those of ostriches\r\nin North India; while remains, believed to be of struthious birds, are\r\nfound in the Eocene deposits of England; and the Cretaceous rocks of North\r\nAmerica have yielded the extraordinary toothed bird, Hesperornis, which\r\nProfessor O. Marsh declares to have been \"a carnivorous swimming ostrich.\"\r\n\r\nAs to the second point, we have the remarkable fact that all known birds of\r\nthis group have not only the rudiments of wing-bones, but also the\r\nrudiments of wings, that is, an external limb bearing rigid quills or\r\nlargely-developed {481} plumes. In the cassowary these wing-feathers are\r\nreduced to long spines like porcupine-quills, while even in the Apteryx,\r\nthe minute external wing bears a series of nearly twenty stiff quill-like\r\nfeathers.[123] These facts render it almost certain that the struthious\r\nbirds do not owe their imperfect wings to a direct evolution from a\r\nreptilian type, but to a retrograde development from some low form of\r\nwinged birds, analogous to that which has produced the dodo and the\r\nsolitaire from the more highly-developed pigeon-type. Professor Marsh has\r\nproved, that so far back as the Cretaceous period, the two great forms of\r\nbirds--those with a keeled sternum and fairly-developed wings, and those\r\nwith a convex keel-less sternum and rudimentary wings--already existed side\r\nby side; while in the still earlier Archaeopteryx of the Jurassic period we\r\nhave a bird with well-developed wings, and therefore probably with a keeled\r\nsternum. We are evidently, therefore, very far from a knowledge of the\r\nearliest stages of bird life, and our acquaintance with the various forms\r\nthat have existed is scanty in the extreme; but we may be sure that birds\r\nacquired wings, and feathers, and some power of flight, before they\r\ndeveloped a keeled sternum, since we see that bats with no such keel fly\r\nvery well. Since, therefore, the struthious birds all have perfect\r\nfeathers, and all have rudimentary wings, which are anatomically those of\r\ntrue birds, not the rudimentary fore-legs of reptiles, and since we know\r\nthat in many higher groups of birds--as the pigeons and the rails--the\r\nwings have become more or less aborted, and the keel of the sternum greatly\r\nreduced in size by disuse, it seems probable that the very remote ancestors\r\nof the rhea, the cassowary, and the apteryx, were true flying birds,\r\nalthough not perhaps provided with a keeled sternum, or possessing very\r\ngreat powers of flight. But in addition to the possible ancestral power of\r\nflight, we have the undoubted fact that the rhea and the emu both swim\r\nfreely, the former having been seen swimming from island to island off the\r\ncoast of Patagonia. This, taken in connection with the wonderful aquatic\r\nostrich of the Cretaceous period discovered by Professor Marsh, opens {482}\r\nup fresh possibilities of migration; while the immense antiquity thus given\r\nto the group and their universal distribution in past time, renders all\r\nsuggestions of special modes of communication between the parts of the\r\nglobe in which their scattered remnants _now_ happen to exist, altogether\r\nsuperfluous and misleading.\r\n\r\nThe bearing of this argument on our present subject is, that so far as\r\naccounting for the presence of wingless birds in New Zealand is concerned,\r\nwe have nothing whatever to do with any possible connection, by way of a\r\nsouthern continent or antarctic islands, with South America and South\r\nAfrica, because the nearest allies of its moas and kiwis are the\r\ncassowaries and emus, and we have distinct indications of a former land\r\nextension towards North Australia and New Guinea, which is exactly what we\r\nrequire for the original entrance of the struthious type into the New\r\nZealand area.\r\n\r\n_Winged Birds and Lower Vertebrates of New Zealand._--Having given a pretty\r\nfull account of the New Zealand fauna elsewhere[124] I need only here point\r\nout its bearing on the hypothesis now advanced, of the former\r\nland-connection having been with North Australia, New Guinea, and the\r\nWestern Pacific Islands, rather than with the temperate regions of\r\nAustralia.\r\n\r\nOf the Australian genera of birds, which are found also in New Zealand,\r\nalmost every one ranges also into New Guinea or the Pacific Islands, while\r\nthe few that do not extend beyond Australia are found in its northern\r\ndistricts. As regards the peculiar New Zealand genera, all whose affinities\r\ncan be traced are allied to birds which belong to the tropical parts of the\r\nAustralian region; while the starling family, to which four of the most\r\nremarkable New Zealand birds belong (the genera Creadion, Heterolocha, and\r\nCallaeas), is totally wanting in temperate Australia and is comparatively\r\nscarce in the entire Australian region, but is abundant in the Oriental\r\nregion, with which New Guinea and the Moluccas are in easy communication.\r\nIt is certainly a most suggestive fact that there are more than sixty {483}\r\ngenera of birds peculiar to the Australian continent (with Tasmania), many\r\nof them almost or quite confined to its temperate portions, and that no\r\nsingle one of these should be represented in temperate New Zealand.[125]\r\nThe affinities of the living and more highly organised, no less than those\r\nof the extinct and wingless birds, strikingly accord with the line of\r\ncommunication indicated by the deep submarine bank connecting these\r\ntemperate islands with the tropical parts of the Australian region.\r\n\r\nThe reptiles, so far as they go, are quite in accordance with the birds.\r\nThe lizards belong to two genera, Lygosoma, which has a wide range in all\r\nthe tropics as well as in Australia; and Naultinus, a genus peculiar to New\r\nZealand, but belonging to a family--Geckonidae--spread over the whole of\r\nthe warmer parts of the world. Australia, with New Guinea, on the other\r\nhand, has a peculiar family, and no less than twenty-one peculiar genera of\r\nlizards, many of which are confined to its temperate regions, but no one of\r\nthem extends to temperate New Zealand.[126] The extraordinary lizard-like\r\n_Hatteria punctata_ of New Zealand forms of itself a distinct order of\r\nreptiles, in some respects intermediate between lizards and crocodiles, and\r\nhaving therefore no affinity with any living animal.\r\n\r\nThe only representative of the Amphibia in New Zealand is a solitary frog\r\nof a peculiar genus (_Liopelma hochstetteri_); but it has no affinity for\r\nany of the Australian frogs, which are numerous, and belong to eleven\r\ndifferent families; while the Liopelma belongs {484} to a very distinct\r\nfamily (Discoglossidae), confined to the Palaearctic region.\r\n\r\nOf the fresh-water fishes we need only say here, that none belong to\r\npeculiar Australian types, but are related to those of temperate South\r\nAmerica or of Asia.\r\n\r\nThe Invertebrate classes are comparatively little known, and their modes of\r\ndispersal are so varied and exceptional that the facts presented by their\r\ndistribution can add little weight to those already adduced. We will,\r\ntherefore, now proceed to the conclusions which can fairly be drawn from\r\nthe general facts of New Zealand natural history already known to us.\r\n\r\n_Deductions from the Peculiarities of the New Zealand Fauna._--The total\r\nabsence (or extreme scarcity) of mammals in New Zealand obliges us to place\r\nits union with North Australia and New Guinea at a very remote epoch. We\r\nmust either go back to a time when Australia itself had not yet received\r\nthe ancestral forms of its present marsupials and monotremes, or we must\r\nsuppose that the portion of Australia with which New Zealand was connected\r\nwas then itself isolated from the mainland, and was thus without a\r\nmammalian population. We shall see in our next chapter that there are\r\ncertain facts in the distribution of plants, no less than in the geological\r\nstructure of the country, which favour the latter view. But we must on any\r\nsupposition place the union very far back, to account for the total want of\r\nidentity between the winged birds of New Zealand and those peculiar to\r\nAustralia, and a similar want of accordance in the lizards, the fresh-water\r\nfishes, and the more important insect-groups of the two countries. From\r\nwhat we know of the long geological duration of the generic types of these\r\ngroups we must certainly go back to the earlier portion of the Tertiary\r\nperiod at least, in order that there should be such a complete disseverance\r\nas exists between the characteristic animals of the two countries; and we\r\nmust further suppose that, since their separation, there has been no\r\nsubsequent union or sufficiently near approach to allow of any important\r\nintermigration, even of winged birds, between them. It seems probable,\r\ntherefore, that {485} the Bampton shoal west of New Caledonia, and Lord\r\nHowe's Island further south, formed the western limits of that extensive\r\nland in which the great wingless birds and other isolated members of the\r\nNew Zealand fauna were developed. Whether this early land extended eastward\r\nto the Chatham Islands and southward to the Macquaries we have no means of\r\nascertaining, but as the intervening sea appears to be not more than about\r\n1,500 fathoms deep it is quite possible that such an amount of subsidence\r\nmay have occurred. It is possible, too, that there may have been an\r\nextension northward to the Kermadec Islands, and even further to the Tonga\r\nand Fiji Islands, though this is hardly probable, or we should find more\r\ncommunity between their productions and those of New Zealand.\r\n\r\nA southern extension towards the Antarctic continent at a somewhat later\r\nperiod seems more probable, as affording an easy passage for the numerous\r\nspecies of South American and Antarctic plants, and also for the identical\r\nand closely allied fresh-water fishes of these countries.\r\n\r\nThe subsequent breaking up of this extensive land into a number of separate\r\nislands in which the distinct species of moa and kiwi were developed--their\r\nunion at a later period, and the final submergence of all but the existing\r\nislands, is a pure hypothesis, which seems necessary to explain the\r\noccurrence of so many species of these birds in a small area but of which\r\nwe have no independent proof. There are, however, some other facts which\r\nwould be explained by it, as the presence of three peculiar but allied\r\ngenera of starlings, the three species of parrots of the genus Nestor, and\r\nthe six distinct rails of the genus Ocydromus, as well as the numerous\r\nspecies in some of the peculiar New Zealand genera of plants, which seem\r\nless likely to have been developed in a single area than when isolated, and\r\nthus preserved from the counteracting influence of intercrossing.\r\n\r\nIn the present state of our knowledge these seem all the conclusions we can\r\narrive at from a study of the New Zealand fauna; but as we fortunately\r\npossess a tolerably {486} full and accurate knowledge of the flora of New\r\nZealand, as well as of that of Australia and the south temperate lands\r\ngenerally, it will be well to see how far these conclusions are supported\r\nby the facts of plant distribution, and what further indications they\r\nafford us of the early history of these most interesting countries. This\r\ninquiry is of sufficient importance to occupy a separate chapter.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{487}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nTHE FLORA OF NEW ZEALAND: ITS AFFINITIES AND PROBABLE ORIGIN\r\n\r\n    Relations of the New Zealand Flora to that of Australia--General\r\n    Features of the Australian Flora--The Floras of South-eastern and\r\n    South-western Australia--Geological Explanation of the Differences of\r\n    these two Floras--The Origin of the Australian Element in the New\r\n    Zealand Flora--Tropical Character of the New Zealand Flora\r\n    Explained--Species Common to New Zealand and Australia mostly Temperate\r\n    Forms--Why Easily Dispersed Plants have often Restricted\r\n    Ranges--Summary and Conclusion on the New Zealand Flora.\r\n\r\nAlthough plants have means of dispersal far exceeding those possessed by\r\nanimals, yet as a matter of fact comparatively few species are carried for\r\nvery great distances, and the flora of a country taken as a whole usually\r\naffords trustworthy indications of its past history. Plants, too, are more\r\nnumerous in species than the higher animals, and are almost always better\r\nknown; their affinities have been more systematically studied; and it may\r\nbe safely affirmed that no explanation of the origin of the fauna of a\r\ncountry can be sound, which does not also explain, or at least harmonise\r\nwith, the distribution and relations of its flora. The distribution of the\r\ntwo may be very different, but both should be explicable by the same series\r\nof geographical changes.\r\n\r\nThe relations of the flora of New Zealand to that of Australia have long\r\nformed an insoluble enigma for {488} botanists. Sir Joseph Hooker, in his\r\nmost instructive and masterly essay on the flora of Australia,\r\nsays:--\"Under whatever aspect I regard the flora of Australia and of New\r\nZealand, I find all attempts to theorise on the possible causes of their\r\ncommunity of feature frustrated by anomalies in distribution, such as I\r\nbelieve no two other similarly situated countries in the globe present.\r\nEverywhere else I recognise a parallelism or harmony in the main common\r\nfeatures of contiguous floras, which conveys the impression of their\r\ngeneric affinity, at least, being affected by migration from centres of\r\ndispersion in one of them, or in some adjacent country. In this case it is\r\nwidely different. Regarding the question from the Australian point of view,\r\nit is impossible in the present state of science to reconcile the fact of\r\nAcacia, Eucalyptus, Casuarina, Callitris, &c., being absent in New Zealand,\r\nwith any theory of transoceanic migration that may be adopted to explain\r\nthe presence of other Australian plants in New Zealand; and it is very\r\ndifficult to conceive of a time or of conditions that could explain these\r\nanomalies, except by going back to epochs when the prevalent botanical as\r\nwell as geographical features of each were widely different from what they\r\nare now. On the other hand, if I regard the question from the New Zealand\r\npoint of view, I find such broad features of resemblance, and so many\r\nconnecting links that afford irresistible evidence of a close botanical\r\nconnection, that I cannot abandon the conviction that these great\r\ndifferences will present the least difficulties to whatever theory may\r\nexplain the whole case.\" I will now state, as briefly as possible, what are\r\nthe facts above referred to as being of so anomalous a character, and there\r\nis little difficulty in doing so, as we have them fully set forth, with\r\nadmirable clearness, in the essay above alluded to, and in the same\r\nwriter's _Introduction to the Flora of New Zealand_, only requiring some\r\nslight modifications, owing to the later discoveries which are given in the\r\n_Handbook of the New Zealand Flora_.\r\n\r\nConfining ourselves always to flowering plants, we find that the flora of\r\nNew Zealand is a very poor one, considering the extent of surface, and the\r\nfavourable conditions of {489} soil and climate. It consists of 1,085\r\nspecies (our own islands possessing about 1,500), but a very large\r\nproportion of these are peculiar, there being no less than 800 endemic\r\nspecies, and thirty-two endemic genera.\r\n\r\nOut of the 285 species not peculiar to New Zealand, no less than 215 are\r\nAustralian, but a considerable number of these are also Antarctic, South\r\nAmerican, or European; so that there are only about 100 _species_\r\nabsolutely confined to New Zealand and Australia, and, what is important as\r\nindicating a somewhat recent immigration, only some half-dozen of these\r\nbelong to _genera_ which are peculiar to the two countries, and hardly any\r\nto the larger and more important Australian genera. Many, too, are rare\r\nspecies in both countries and are often alpines.\r\n\r\nFar more important are the relations of the genera and families of the two\r\ncountries. All the Natural Orders of New Zealand are found in Australia\r\nexcept three--Coriariae, a widely-scattered group found in South Europe,\r\nthe Himalayas, and the Andes; Escallonieae, a widely distributed group; and\r\nChloranthaceae, found in Tropical Asia, Japan, Polynesia, and South\r\nAmerica. Out of a total of 310 New Zealand genera, no less than 248 are\r\nAustralian, and sixty of these are almost peculiar to the two countries,\r\nonly thirty-two however being absolutely confined to them.[127] In the\r\nthree large orders--Compositae, Orchideae, and Gramineae, the genera are\r\nalmost identical in the two countries, while the species--in the two former\r\nespecially--are mostly distinct.\r\n\r\nHere then we have apparently a wonderful resemblance between the New\r\nZealand flora and that of Australia, indicated by more than two-thirds of\r\nthe non-peculiar species, and more than nine-tenths of the non-peculiar\r\ngenera (255) being Australian. But now let us look at the other side of the\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nThere are in Australia seven great genera of plants, each containing more\r\nthan 100 species, all widely spread over {490} the country, and all highly\r\ncharacteristic Australian forms,--Acacia, Eucalyptus, Melaleuca,\r\nLeucopogon, Stylidium, Grevillea, and Hakea. These are entirely absent from\r\nNew Zealand, except one species of Leucopogon, a genus which also has\r\nrepresentatives in the Malayan and Pacific Islands. Sixteen more Australian\r\ngenera have over fifty species each, and of these eight are totally absent\r\nfrom New Zealand, five are represented by one or two species, and only two\r\nare fairly represented; but these two--Drosera and Helichrysum--are very\r\nwidespread genera, and might have reached New Zealand from other countries\r\nthan Australia.\r\n\r\nBut this by no means exhausts the differences between New Zealand and\r\nAustralia. No less than seven Australian Natural Orders--Dilleniaceae,\r\nBuettneriaceae, Polygaleae, Tremandreae, Casuarineae, Haemodoraceae, and\r\nXyrideae are entirely wanting in New Zealand, and several others which are\r\nexcessively abundant and highly characteristic of the former country are\r\nvery poorly represented in the latter. Thus, Leguminosae are extremely\r\nabundant in Australia, where there are over 1,000 species belonging to\r\nabout 100 genera, many of them altogether peculiar to the country; yet in\r\nNew Zealand this great order is most scantily represented, there being only\r\nfive genera and thirteen species; and only two of these genera, Swainsonia\r\nand Clianthus, are Australian, and as the latter consists of but two\r\nspecies it may as well have passed from New Zealand to Australia as the\r\nother way, or more probably from some third country to them both.[128]\r\nGoodeniaceae with ten genera and 220 species Australian, has but two\r\nspecies in New Zealand--and one of these is a salt-marsh plant found also\r\nin Tasmania and in Chile; and four other large Australian orders--Rhamneae,\r\nMyoporineae, Proteaceae and Santalaceae, have very few representatives in\r\nNew Zealand.\r\n\r\nWe find, then, that the great fact we have to explain and account for is,\r\nthe undoubted affinity of the New {491} Zealand flora to that of Australia,\r\nbut an affinity almost exclusively confined to the least predominant and\r\nleast peculiar portion of that flora, leaving the most predominant, most\r\ncharacteristic, and most widely distributed portion absolutely\r\nunrepresented. We must however be careful not to exaggerate the amount of\r\naffinity with Australia, apparently implied by the fact that nearly\r\nsix-sevenths of the New Zealand genera are also Australian, for, as we have\r\nalready stated, a very large number of these are European, Antarctic, South\r\nAmerican or Polynesian genera, whose presence in the two contiguous areas\r\nonly indicates a common origin. About one-eighth, only, are absolutely\r\nconfined to Australia and New Zealand (thirty-two genera), and even of\r\nthese several are better represented in New Zealand than in Australia, and\r\nmay therefore have passed from the former to the latter. No less than 174\r\nof the New Zealand genera are temperate South American, many being also\r\nAntarctic or European; while others again are especially tropical or\r\nPolynesian; yet undoubtedly a larger proportion of the Natural Orders and\r\ngenera are common to Australia than to any other country, so that we may\r\nsay that the basis of the flora is Australian with a large intermixture of\r\nnorthern and southern temperate forms and others which have remote\r\nworld-wide affinities.\r\n\r\n_General Features of the Australian Flora and its Probable Origin._--Before\r\nproceeding to point out how the peculiarities of the New Zealand flora may\r\nbe best accounted for, it is necessary to consider briefly what are the\r\nmain peculiarities of Australian vegetation, from which so important a part\r\nof that of New Zealand has evidently been derived.\r\n\r\nThe actual Australian flora consists of two great divisions--a temperate\r\nand a tropical, the temperate being again divisible into an eastern and a\r\nwestern portion. All that is most characteristic of the Australian flora\r\nbelongs to the temperate division (though these often overspread the whole\r\ncontinent), in which are found almost all the remarkable Australian types\r\nof vegetation and the numerous genera peculiar to this part of the world.\r\nContrary to what occurs in most other countries, the {492} tropical appears\r\nto be less rich in species and genera than the temperate region, and what\r\nis still more remarkable it contains fewer peculiar species, and very few\r\npeculiar genera. Although the area of tropical Australia is about equal to\r\nthat of the temperate portions, and it has now been pretty well explored\r\nbotanically, it has probably not more than half as many species.[129]\r\nNearly 500 of its species are identical with Indian or Malayan plants, or\r\nare very close representatives of them; while there are more than 200\r\nIndian genera, confined for the most part to the tropical portion of\r\nAustralia. The remainder of the tropical flora consists of a few species\r\nand many genera of temperate {493} Australia which range over the whole\r\ncontinent, but these form only a small portion of the peculiarly Australian\r\ngenera.\r\n\r\nThese remarkable facts clearly point to one conclusion--that the flora of\r\ntropical Australia is, comparatively, recent and derivative. If we imagine\r\nthe greater part of North Australia to have been submerged beneath the\r\nocean, from which it rose in the middle or latter part of the Tertiary\r\nperiod, offering an extensive area ready to be covered by such suitable\r\nforms of vegetation as could first reach it, something like the present\r\ncondition of things would inevitably arise. From the north, widespread\r\nIndian and Malay plants would quickly enter, while from the south the most\r\ndominant forms of warm-temperate Australia, and such as were best adapted\r\nto the tropical climate and arid soil, would intermingle with them. Even if\r\nnumerous islands had occupied the area of Northern Australia for long\r\nperiods anterior to the final elevation, very much the same state of things\r\nwould result.\r\n\r\nThe existence in North and North-east Australia of enormous areas covered\r\nwith Cretaceous and other Secondary deposits, as well as extensive Tertiary\r\nformations, lends support to the view, that during very long epochs\r\ntemperate Australia was cut off from all close connection with the tropical\r\nand northern lands by a wide extent of sea; and this isolation is exactly\r\nwhat was required, in order to bring about the wonderful amount of\r\nspecialisation and the high development manifested by the typical\r\nAustralian flora. Before proceeding further, however, let us examine this\r\nflora itself, so far as regards its component parts and probable past\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\n_The Floras of South-eastern and South-western Australia._--The\r\npeculiarities presented by the south-eastern and south-western subdivisions\r\nof the flora of temperate Australia are most interesting and suggestive,\r\nand are, perhaps, unparalleled in any other part of the world. South-west\r\nAustralia is far less extensive than the south-eastern division--less\r\nvaried in soil and climate, with no lofty mountains, and much sandy desert;\r\nyet, strange to say, it contains an equally rich flora and a far greater\r\nproportion of peculiar species and genera of plants. As Sir {494} Joseph\r\nHooker remarks:--\"What differences there are in conditions would, judging\r\nfrom analogy with other countries, favour the idea that South-eastern\r\nAustralia, from its far greater area, many large rivers, extensive tracts\r\nof mountainous country and humid forests, would present much the most\r\nextensive flora, of which only the drier types could extend into\r\nSouth-western Australia. But such is not the case; for though the far\r\ngreater area is much the best explored, presents more varied conditions,\r\nand is tenanted by a larger number of Natural Orders and genera, these\r\ncontain fewer species by several hundreds.\"[130]\r\n\r\nThe fewer genera of South-western Australia are due almost wholly to the\r\nabsence of the numerous European, Antarctic, and South-American types found\r\nin the south-eastern region, while in purely Australian types it is far the\r\nricher, for while it contains most of those found in the east it has a\r\nlarge number altogether peculiar to it; and Sir Joseph Hooker states that\r\n\"there are about 180 genera, out of 600 in South-western Australia, that\r\nare either not found at all in South-eastern, or that are represented there\r\nby a very few species only, and these 180 genera include nearly 1,100\r\nspecies.\"\r\n\r\n_Geological Explanation of the Differences of these Two Floras._--These\r\nfacts again clearly point to the conclusion that South-western Australia is\r\nthe remnant of the more extensive and more isolated portion of the\r\ncontinent in which the peculiar Australian flora was principally developed.\r\nThe existence there of a very large area of granite--800 miles in length by\r\nnearly 500 in maximum width with detached masses 200 miles to the north and\r\n500 miles to the east--indicates such an extension; for these {495}\r\ngranitic masses were certainly once buried under piles of stratified rock,\r\nsince denuded, and then formed the nucleus of the old Western Australian\r\ncontinent. If we take the 1000-fathom line around the southern part of\r\nAustralia to represent the probable extension of this old land we shall see\r\nthat it would give a wide additional area south of the Great Australian\r\nBight, and form a continent which, even if the greater part of tropical\r\nAustralia were submerged, would be sufficient for the development of a\r\npeculiar and abundant flora. We must also remember that an elevation of\r\n6000 feet, added to the vast amount which has been taken away by\r\ndenudation, would change the whole country, including what are now the\r\ndeserts of the interior, into a mountainous and well-watered region.\r\n\r\nBut while this rich and peculiar flora was in process of formation, the\r\neastern portion of the continent must either have been widely separated\r\nfrom the western or had perhaps not yet risen from the ocean. The whole of\r\nthis part of the country consists of Palaeozoic and Secondary formations\r\nwith granite and metamorphic rocks, the Secondary deposits being largely\r\ndeveloped on both sides of the central range, extending the whole length of\r\nthe continent from Tasmania to Cape York, and constituting the greater part\r\nof the plateau of the Blue Mountains and other lofty ranges. During some\r\nportion of the Secondary and Tertiary periods therefore, this side of\r\nAustralia must have been almost wholly submerged beneath the ocean; and if\r\nwe suppose that during this time the western part of the continent was at\r\nnearly its maximum extent and elevation, we shall have a sufficient\r\nexplanation of the great difference between the flora of Western and\r\nEastern Australia, since the latter would only have been able to receive\r\nimmigrants from the former, at a later period, and in a more or less\r\nfragmentary manner.\r\n\r\nIf we examine the geological map of Australia (given in Stanford's\r\nCompendium of Geography and Travel, volume _Australasia_), we shall see\r\ngood reason to conclude that the eastern and the western divisions of the\r\ncountry first existed as separate islands, and only became united at a\r\ncomparatively recent epoch. This is indicated by an {496} enormous stretch\r\nof Cretaceous and Tertiary formations extending from the Gulf of\r\nCarpentaria completely across the continent to the mouth of the Murray\r\nRiver. During the Cretaceous period, therefore, and probably throughout a\r\nconsiderable portion of the Tertiary epoch,[131] there must have been a\r\nwide arm of the sea occupying this area, dividing the great mass of land on\r\nthe west--the true seat and origin of the typical Australian flora--from a\r\nlong but narrow belt of land on the east, indicated by the continuous mass\r\nof Secondary and Palaeozoic formations already referred to which extend\r\nuninterruptedly from Tasmania to Cape York. Whether this formed one\r\ncontinuous land, or was broken up into islands, cannot be positively\r\ndetermined; but the fact that no marine Tertiary beds occur in the whole of\r\nthis area, renders it probable that it was almost, if not quite,\r\ncontinuous, and that it not improbably extended across to what is now New\r\nGuinea. At this epoch, then (as shown in the accompanying map), Australia\r\nmay, not improbably, have consisted of a very large and fertile western\r\nisland, almost or quite extratropical, and extending from the Silurian\r\nrocks of the Flinders range in South Australia, to about 150 miles west of\r\nthe present west coast, and southward to about 350 miles south of the Great\r\nAustralian Bight. To the east of this, at a distance of from 250 to 400\r\nmiles, extended in a north and south direction a long but comparatively\r\nnarrow island, stretching from far south of Tasmania to New Guinea; while\r\nthe crystalline and Secondary formations of central North Australia\r\nprobably indicate the existence of one or more large islands in that\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\n{497}\r\n\r\n  The white portions represent land; the shaded parts sea.\r\n  The existing land of Australia is shown in outline.]\r\n\r\nThe eastern and the western islands--with which we are now chiefly\r\nconcerned--would then differ considerably in their vegetation and animal\r\nlife. The western and more ancient land already possessed, in its main\r\nfeatures, the peculiar Australian flora, and also the ancestral forms of\r\nits strange marsupial fauna, both of which it had probably received at some\r\nearlier epoch by a temporary union with the Asiatic continent over what is\r\nnow the Java sea. Eastern Australia, on the other hand, possessed only the\r\nrudiments of its existing mixed flora, derived from three distinct sources.\r\nSome important fragments of the typical Australian vegetation had reached\r\nit across the marine {498} strait, and had spread widely owing to the soil,\r\nclimate and general conditions being exactly suited to it: from the north\r\nand north-east a tropical vegetation of Polynesian type had occupied\r\nsuitable areas in the north; while the extension southward of the Tasmanian\r\npeninsula, accompanied, probably, as now, with lofty mountains, favoured\r\nthe immigration of south-temperate forms from whatever Antarctic lands or\r\nislands then existed. This supposition is strikingly in harmony with what\r\nis known of the ancient flora of this portion of Australia. In deposits\r\nsupposed to be of Eocene age in New South Wales and Victoria fossil plants\r\nhave been found showing a very different vegetation from that now existing.\r\nAlong with a few Australian types--such as Pittosporum, Knightia, and\r\nEucalyptus, there occur birches, alders, oaks, and beeches; while in\r\nTasmania in freshwater limestone, apparently of Miocene age, are found\r\nwillows, alders, birches, oaks, and beeches,[132] all except the latter\r\ngenus (Fagus) now quite extinct in Australia.[133] These temperate forms\r\nprobably indicate a more oceanic climate, cooler and moister than at\r\npresent. The union with Western Australia and the establishment of an arid\r\ninterior by modifying the climate may have led to the extinction of many of\r\nthese forms and their replacement by special Australian types more suited\r\nto the new conditions.\r\n\r\nAt this time the marsupial fauna had not yet reached this eastern land,\r\nwhich was, however, occupied in the north by some ancestral struthious\r\nbirds, which had entered it by way of New Guinea through some very ancient\r\ncontinental extension, and of which the emu, the cassowaries, the extinct\r\nDromornis of Queensland, and the moas and kiwis of New Zealand, are the\r\nmodified descendants.\r\n\r\n_The Origin of the Australian Element in the New Zealand Flora._--We have\r\nnow brought down the history of Australia, as deduced from its geological\r\nstructure and the main features of its existing and Tertiary flora, to the\r\nperiod {499} when New Zealand was first brought into close connection with\r\nit, by means of a great north-western extension of that country, which, as\r\nalready explained in our last chapter, is so clearly indicated by the form\r\nof the sea bottom (See Map, p. 471). The condition of New Zealand previous\r\nto this event is very obscure. That it had long existed as a more or less\r\nextensive land is indicated by its ancient sedimentary rocks; while the\r\nvery small areas occupied by Jurassic and Cretaceous deposits, imply that\r\nmuch of the present land was then also above the sea-level. The country had\r\nprobably at that time a scanty vegetation of mixed Antarctic and Polynesian\r\norigin; but now, for the first time, it would be open to the free\r\nimmigration of such Australian types as were suitable to its climate, and\r\nwhich _had already reached the tropical and sub-tropical portions of the\r\nEastern Australian island_. It is here that we obtain the clue to those\r\nstrange anomalies and contradictions presented by the New Zealand flora in\r\nits relation to Australia, which have been so clearly set forth by Sir\r\nJoseph Hooker, and which have so puzzled botanists to account for. But\r\nthese apparent anomalies cease to present any difficulty when we see that\r\nthe Australian plants in New Zealand were acquired, not directly, but, as\r\nit were, at second hand, by union with an island which itself had as yet\r\nonly received a portion of its existing flora. And then, further\r\ndifficulties were placed in the way of New Zealand receiving such an\r\nadequate representation of that portion of the flora which had reached East\r\nAustralia as its climate and position entitled it to, by the fact of the\r\nunion being, not with the temperate, but with the tropical and sub-tropical\r\nportions of that island, so that only those groups could be acquired which\r\nwere less exclusively temperate, and had already established themselves in\r\nthe warmer portion of their new home.[134]\r\n\r\n{500}\r\n\r\nIt is therefore no matter of surprise, but exactly what we should expect,\r\nthat the great mass of pre-eminently temperate Australian genera should be\r\nabsent from New Zealand, including the whole of such important families as,\r\nDilleniaceae, Tremandreae, Buettneriacae, Polygaleae, Casuarineae and\r\nHaemodoraceae; while others, such as Rutaceae, Stackhousieae, Rhamneae,\r\nMyrtaceae, Proteaceae, and Santalaceae, are represented by only a few\r\nspecies. Thus, too, we can explain the absence of _all_ the peculiar\r\nAustralian Leguminosae; for these were still mainly confined to the great\r\nwestern island, along with the peculiar Acacias and Eucalypti, which at a\r\nlater period spread over the whole continent. It is equally accordant with\r\nthe view we are maintaining, that among the groups which Sir Joseph Hooker\r\nenumerates as \"keeping up the features of extra tropical Australia in its\r\ntropical quarter,\" several should have reached New Zealand, such as\r\nDrosera, some Pittosporeae and Myoporineae, with a few Proteaceae,\r\nLoganiaceae, and Restiaceae; for most of these are not only found in\r\ntropical Australia, but also in the Malayan and Pacific islands.\r\n\r\n_Tropical Character of the New Zealand Flora Explained._--In this origin of\r\nthe New Zealand fauna by a north-western route from North-eastern\r\nAustralia, we find also an explanation of the remarkable number of tropical\r\ngroups of plants found there: for though, as Sir Joseph Hooker has {501}\r\nshown, a moist and uniform climate favours the extension of tropical forms\r\nin the temperate zone, yet some means must be afforded them for reaching a\r\ntemperate island. On carefully going through the _Handbook_, and comparing\r\nits indications with those of Bentham's _Flora Australiensis_, I find that\r\nthere are in New Zealand thirty-eight thoroughly tropical genera,\r\nthirty-three of which are found in Australia--mostly in the tropical\r\nportion of it, though a few are temperate, and these may have reached it\r\nthrough New Zealand[135]. To these we must add thirty-two more genera,\r\nwhich, though chiefly developed in temperate Australia, extend into the\r\ntropical or sub-tropical portions of it, and may well have reached New\r\nZealand by the same route.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand we find but few New Zealand genera certainly derived from\r\nAustralia which are especially temperate, and it may be as well to give a\r\nlist of such as {502} do occur with a few remarks. They are sixteen in\r\nnumber, as follows:--\r\n\r\n    1. Pennantia (1 sp.). This genus has a species in Norfolk Island,\r\n    indicating perhaps its former extension to the north-west.\r\n\r\n    2. Pomaderris (3 sp.). One _species_ inhabits Victoria and New Zealand,\r\n    indicating recent trans-oceanic migration.\r\n\r\n    3. Quintinia (2 sp.). This genus has winged seeds facilitating\r\n    migration.\r\n\r\n    4. Olearia (20 sp.). Seeds with pappus.\r\n\r\n    5. Craspedia (2 sp.). Seeds with pappus. Alpine; identical with\r\n    Australian species, and therefore of comparatively recent introduction.\r\n\r\n    6. Celmisia (25 sp.). Seeds with pappus. Only three Australian species,\r\n    two of which are identical with New Zealand forms, probably therefore\r\n    derived from New Zealand.\r\n\r\n    7. Ozothamnus (5 sp.). Seeds with pappus.\r\n\r\n    8. Epacris (4 sp.). Minute seeds. Some species are sub-tropical, and\r\n    they are all found in the northern (warmer) island of New Zealand.\r\n\r\n    9. Archeria (2 sp.). Minute seeds. A species common to E. Australia and\r\n    New Zealand.\r\n\r\n    10. Logania (3 sp.). Small seeds. Alpine plants.\r\n\r\n    11. Hedycarya (1 sp.).\r\n\r\n    12. Chiloglottis (1 sp.). Minute seeds. In Auckland Islands; alpine in\r\n    Australia.\r\n\r\n    13. Prasophyllum (1 sp.). Minute seeds. Identical with Australian\r\n    species, indicating recent transmission.\r\n\r\n    14. Orthoceras (1 sp.). Minute seeds. Identical with an Australian\r\n    species.\r\n\r\n    15. Alepyrum (1 sp.). Alpine, moss-like. An Antarctic type.\r\n\r\n    16. Dichelachne (3 sp.). Identical with Australian species. An awned\r\n    grass.\r\n\r\nWe thus see that there are special features in most of these plants that\r\nwould facilitate transmission across the sea between temperate Australia\r\nand New Zealand, or to both from some Antarctic island; and the fact that\r\nin several of them the species are absolutely identical shows that such\r\ntransmission has occurred in geologically recent times.\r\n\r\n_Species Common to New Zealand and Australia Mostly Temperate Forms._--Let\r\nus now take the _species_ which are common to New Zealand and Australia,\r\nbut found nowhere else, and which must therefore have passed from one\r\ncountry to the other at a more recent period than the mass of _genera_ with\r\nwhich we have hitherto been dealing. These are ninety-six in number, and\r\nthey present a striking contrast to the similarly restricted _genera_ in\r\nbeing wholly temperate in character, the entire list presenting only a\r\n{503} single species which is confined to sub-tropical East Australia--a\r\ngrass (_Apera arundinacea_) only found in a few localities on the New\r\nZealand coast.\r\n\r\nNow it is clear that the larger portion, if not the whole, of these plants\r\nmust have reached New Zealand from Australia (or in a few cases Australia\r\nfrom New Zealand), by transmission across the sea, because we know there\r\nhas been no actual land connection during the Tertiary period, as proved by\r\nthe absence of all the Australian mammalia, and almost all the most\r\ncharacteristic Australian birds, insects, and plants. The form of the\r\nsea-bed shows that the distance could not have been less than 600 miles,\r\neven during the greatest extension of Southern New Zealand and Tasmania;\r\nand we have no reason to suppose it to have been less, because in other\r\ncases an equally abundant flora of identical species has reached islands at\r\na still greater distance--notably in the case of the Azores and Bermuda.\r\nThe character of the plants is also just what we should expect: for about\r\ntwo-thirds of them belong to genera of world-wide range in the temperate\r\nzones, such as Ranunculus, Drosera, Epilobium, Gnaphalium, Senecio,\r\nConvolvulus, Atriplex, Luzula, and many sedges and grasses, whose\r\nexceptionally wide distribution shows that they possess exceptional powers\r\nof dispersal and vigour of constitution, enabling them not only to reach\r\ndistant countries, but also to establish themselves there. Another set of\r\nplants belong to especially Antarctic or south temperate groups, such as\r\nColobanthus, Acaena, Gaultheria, Pernettya, and Muhlenbeckia, and these may\r\nin some cases have reached both Australia and New Zealand from some now\r\nsubmerged Antarctic island. Again, about one-fourth of the whole are alpine\r\nplants, and these possess two advantages as colonisers. Their lofty\r\nstations place them in the best position to have their seeds carried away\r\nby winds; and they would in this case reach a country which, having derived\r\nthe earlier portion of its flora from the side of the tropics, would be\r\nlikely to have its higher mountains and favourable alpine stations to a\r\ngreat extent unoccupied, or occupied by plants unable to compete with\r\nspecially adapted alpine groups. {504}\r\n\r\nFully one-third of the exclusively Australo-New Zealand species belong to\r\nthe two great orders of the sedges and the grasses; and there can be no\r\ndoubt that these have great facilities for dispersion in a variety of ways.\r\nTheir seeds, often enveloped in chaffy glumes, would be carried long\r\ndistances by storms of wind, and even if finally dropped into the sea would\r\nhave so much less distance to reach the land by means of surface currents;\r\nand Mr. Darwin's experiments show that even cultivated oats germinated\r\nafter 100 days' immersion in sea-water. Others have hispid awns by which\r\nthey would become attached to the feathers of birds, and there is no doubt\r\nthis is an effective mode of dispersal. But a still more important point\r\nis, probably, that these plants are generally, if not always,\r\nwind-fertilised, and are thus independent of any peculiar insects, which\r\nmight be wanting in the new country.\r\n\r\n_Why Easily-Dispersed Plants have often Restricted Ranges._--This last\r\nconsideration throws light on a very curious point, which has been noted as\r\na difficulty by Sir Joseph Hooker, that plants which have most clear and\r\ndecided powers of dispersal by wind or other means, have _not_ generally\r\nthe widest specific range; and he instances the small number of Compositae\r\ncommon to New Zealand and Australia. But in all these cases it will, I\r\nthink, be found that although the _species_ have not a wide range the\r\n_genera_ often have. In New Zealand, for instance, the Compositae are very\r\nabundant, there being no less than 167 species, almost all belonging to\r\nAustralian genera, yet only about one-sixteenth of the whole are identical\r\nin the two countries. The explanation of this is not difficult. Owing to\r\ntheir great powers of dispersal, the Australian Compositae reached New\r\nZealand at a very remote epoch, and such as were adapted to the climate and\r\nthe means of fertilisation established themselves; but being highly\r\norganised plants with great flexibility of organisation, they soon became\r\nmodified in accordance with the new conditions, producing many special\r\nforms in different localities; and these, spreading widely, soon took\r\npossession of all suitable stations. Henceforth immigrants from Australia\r\nhad to compete {505} with these indigenous and well-established plants, and\r\nonly in a few cases were able to obtain a footing; whence it arises that we\r\nhave many Australian types, but few Australian species, in New Zealand, and\r\nboth phenomena are directly traceable to the combination of great powers of\r\ndispersal with a high degree of adaptability. Exactly the same thing occurs\r\nwith the still more highly specialised Orchideae. These are not\r\nproportionally so numerous in New Zealand (thirty-eight species), and this\r\nis no doubt due to the fact that so many of them require\r\ninsect-fertilisation often by a particular family or genus (whereas almost\r\nany insect will fertilise Compositae), and insects of all orders are\r\nremarkably scarce in New Zealand.[136] This would at once prevent the\r\nestablishment of many of the orchids which may have reached the islands,\r\nwhile those which did find suitable fertilisers and other favourable\r\nconditions would soon become modified into new species. It is thus quite\r\nintelligible why only three species of orchids are identical in Australia\r\nand New Zealand, although their minute and abundant seeds must be dispersed\r\nby the wind almost as readily as the spores of ferns.\r\n\r\nAnother specialised group--the Scrophularineae--abounds in New Zealand,\r\nwhere there are sixty-two species; but though almost all the genera are\r\nAustralian only three species are so. Here, too, the seeds are usually very\r\nsmall, and the powers of dispersal great, as shown by several European\r\ngenera--Veronica, Euphrasia, and Limosella, being found in the southern\r\nhemisphere.\r\n\r\nLooking at the whole series of these Australo-New Zealand plants, we find\r\nthe most highly specialised groups--Compositae, Scrophularineae,\r\nOrchideae--with a small proportion of identical species (one-thirteenth to\r\none twentieth), the less highly specialised--Ranunculaceae, Onagrariae and\r\nEriceae--with a higher proportion (one-ninth to one-sixth), and the least\r\nspecialised--Junceae, {506} Cyperaceae and Gramineae--with the high\r\nproportion in each case of one-fourth. These nine are the most important\r\nNew Zealand orders which contain species common to that country and\r\nAustralia and confined to them; and the marked correspondence they show\r\nbetween high specialisation and want of _specific_ identity, while the\r\n_generic_ identity is in all cases approximately equal, points to the\r\nconclusion that the means of diffusion are, in almost all plants ample,\r\nwhen long periods of time are concerned, and that diversities in this\r\nrespect are not so important in determining the peculiar character of a\r\nderived flora, as adaptability to varied conditions, great powers of\r\nmultiplication, and inherent vigour of constitution. This point will have\r\nto be more fully discussed in treating of the origin of the Antarctic and\r\nnorth temperate members of the New Zealand flora.\r\n\r\n_Summary and Conclusion on the New Zealand Flora._--Confining ourselves\r\nstrictly to the direct relations between the plants of New Zealand and of\r\nAustralia, as I have done in the preceding discussion, I think I may claim\r\nto have shown that the union between the two countries in the latter part\r\nof the Secondary epoch at a time when Eastern Australia was widely\r\nseparated from Western Australia (as shown by its geological formation and\r\nby the contour of the sea-bottom) does sufficiently account for all the\r\nmain features of the New Zealand flora. It shows why the basis of the flora\r\nis fundamentally Australian both as regards orders and genera, for it was\r\ndue either to a direct land connection or a somewhat close approximation\r\nbetween the two countries. It shows also why the great mass of typical\r\nAustralian forms are unrepresented, for the Australian flora is typically\r\n_western_ and _temperate_, and New Zealand received its immigrants from the\r\n_eastern_ island which had itself received only a fragment of this flora,\r\nand from the _tropical_ end of this island, and thus could only receive\r\nsuch forms as were not exclusively temperate in character. It shows,\r\nfurther, why New Zealand contains such a very large proportion of tropical\r\nforms, for we see that it derived the main portion of its flora directly\r\nfrom the tropics. Again, this hypothesis shows us why, though {507} the\r\nspecially Australian _genera_ in New Zealand are largely tropical or\r\nsub-tropical, the specially Australian _species_ are wholly temperate or\r\nalpine; for these are comparatively recent arrivals, they must have\r\nmigrated across the sea in the temperate zone, and these temperate and\r\nalpine forms are exactly such as would be best able to establish themselves\r\nin a country already stocked mainly by tropical forms and their modified\r\ndescendants. This hypothesis further fulfils the conditions implied in Sir\r\nJoseph Hooker's anticipation that--\"these great differences (of the floras)\r\nwill present the least difficulties to whatever theory may explain the\r\nwhole case,\"--for it shows that these differences are directly due to the\r\nhistory and development of the Australian flora itself, while the\r\nresemblances depend upon the most certain cause of all such broad\r\nresemblances--close proximity or actual land connection.\r\n\r\nOne objection will undoubtedly be made to the above theory,--that it does\r\nnot explain why some species of the prominent Australian genera Acacia,\r\nEucalyptus, Melaleuca, Grevillea, &c., have not reached New Zealand in\r\nrecent times along with the other temperate forms that have established\r\nthemselves. But it is doubtful whether any detailed explanation of such a\r\nnegative fact is possible, while general explanations sufficient to cover\r\nit are not wanting. Nothing is more certain than that numerous plants never\r\nrun wild and establish themselves in countries where they nevertheless grow\r\nfreely if cultivated; and the explanation of this fact given by Mr.\r\nDarwin--that they are prevented doing so by the competition of better\r\nadapted forms--is held to be sufficient. In this particular case, however,\r\nwe have some very remarkable evidence of the fact of their non-adaptation.\r\nThe intercourse between New Zealand and Europe has been the means of\r\nintroducing a host of common European plants,--more than 150 in number, as\r\nenumerated at the end of the second volume of the _Handbook_; yet, although\r\nthe intercourse with Australia has probably been greater, only two or three\r\nAustralian plants have similarly established themselves. More remarkable\r\nstill, Sir Joseph Hooker states: {508} \"I am informed that the late Mr.\r\nBidwell habitually scattered Australian seeds during his extensive travels\r\nin New Zealand.\" We may be pretty sure that seeds of such excessively\r\ncommon and characteristic groups as _Acacia_ and _Eucalyptus_ would be\r\namong those so scattered, yet we have no record of any plants of these or\r\nother peculiar Australian genera ever having been found wild, still less of\r\ntheir having spread and taken possession of the soil in the way that many\r\nEuropean plants have done. We are, then, entitled to conclude that the\r\nplants above referred to have not established themselves in New Zealand\r\n(although their seeds may have reached it) because they could not\r\nsuccessfully compete with the indigenous flora which was already well\r\nestablished and better adapted to the conditions of climate and of the\r\norganic environment. This explanation is so perfectly in accordance with a\r\nlarge body of well-known facts, including that which is known to every\r\none--how few of our oldest and hardiest garden plants ever run wild--that\r\nthe objection above stated will, I feel convinced, have no real weight with\r\nany naturalists who have paid attention to this class of questions.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{509}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nON THE ARCTIC ELEMENT IN SOUTH TEMPERATE FLORAS\r\n\r\n    European Species and Genera of Plants in the Southern\r\n    Hemisphere--Aggressive Power of the Scandinavian Flora--Means by which\r\n    Plants have Migrated from North to South--Newly moved Soil as Affording\r\n    Temporary Stations to Migrating Plants--Elevation and Depression of the\r\n    Snow-line as Aiding the Migration of Plants--Changes of Climate\r\n    Favourable to Migration--The Migration from North to South has been\r\n    long going on--Geological Changes as Aiding Migration--Proofs of\r\n    Migration by way of the Andes--Proofs of Migration by way of the\r\n    Himalayas and Southern Asia--Proofs of Migration by way of the African\r\n    Highlands--Supposed Connection of South Africa and Australia--The\r\n    Endemic Genera of Plants in New Zealand--The Absence of Southern Types\r\n    from the Northern Hemisphere--Concluding Remarks on the New Zealand and\r\n    South Temperate Floras.\r\n\r\nWe have now to deal with another portion of the New Zealand flora which\r\npresents perhaps equal difficulties--that which appears to have been\r\nderived from remote parts of the north and south temperate zones; and this\r\nwill lead us to inquire into the origin of the northern or Arctic element\r\nin all the south temperate floras.\r\n\r\nMore than one-third of the entire number of New Zealand genera (115) are\r\nfound also in Europe, and even fifty-eight species are identical in these\r\nremote parts of the world. Temperate South America has seventy-four genera\r\nin common with New Zealand, and there are even eleven species identical in\r\nthe two countries, as well as thirty-two which are close allies or\r\nrepresentative species. {510} A considerable number of these northern or\r\nAntarctic plants and many more which are representative species, are found\r\nalso in Tasmania and in the mountains of temperate Australia; and Sir\r\nJoseph Hooker gives a list of thirty-eight species very characteristic of\r\nEurope and Northern Asia, but almost or quite unknown in the warmer\r\nregions, which yet reappear in temperate Australia. Other genera seem\r\naltogether Antarctic--that is, confined to the extreme southern lands and\r\nislands; and these often have representative species in Southern America,\r\nTasmania, and New Zealand, while others occur only in one or two of these\r\nareas. Many north temperate genera also occur in the mountains of South\r\nAfrica. On the other hand, few if any of the peculiar Australian or\r\nAntarctic types have spread northwards, except some of the former which\r\nhave reached the mountains of Borneo, and a few of the latter which spread\r\nalong the Andes to Mexico.\r\n\r\nOn these remarkable facts, of which I have given but the barest outline,\r\nSir Joseph Hooker makes the following suggestive observations:--\r\n\r\n\"When I take a comprehensive view of the vegetation of the Old World, I am\r\nstruck with the appearance it presents of there being a continuous current\r\nof vegetation (if I may so fancifully express myself) from Scandinavia to\r\nTasmania; along, in short, the whole extent of that arc of the terrestrial\r\nsphere which presents the greatest continuity of land. In the first place\r\nScandinavian genera, and even species, reappear everywhere from Lapland and\r\nIceland to the tops of the Tasmanian Alps, in rapidly diminishing numbers\r\nit is true, but in vigorous development throughout. They abound on the Alps\r\nand Pyrenees, pass on to the Caucasus and Himalayas, thence they extend\r\nalong the Khasia Mountains, and those of the peninsulas of India to those\r\nof Ceylon and the Malayan Archipelago (Java and Borneo), and after a hiatus\r\nof 30deg they appear on the Alps of New South Wales, Victoria, and\r\nTasmania, and beyond these again on those of New Zealand and the Antarctic\r\nIslands, many of the species remaining unchanged throughout! It matters not\r\nwhat the vegetation of the bases and flanks of these mountains may be; the\r\nnorthern species may be {511} associated with alpine forms of Germanic,\r\nSiberian, Oriental, Chinese, American, Malayan, and finally Australian, and\r\nAntarctic types; but whereas these are all, more or less, local\r\nassemblages, the Scandinavian asserts his prerogative of ubiquity from\r\nBritain to beyond its antipodes.\"[137]\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to place the main facts more forcibly before the reader\r\nthan in the above striking passage. It shows clearly that this portion of\r\nthe New Zealand flora is due to wide-spread causes which have acted with\r\neven greater effect in other south temperate lands, and that in order to\r\nexplain its origin we must grapple with the entire problem of the transfer\r\nof the north temperate flora to the southern hemisphere. Taking, therefore,\r\nthe facts as given by Sir Joseph Hooker in the works already referred to, I\r\nshall discuss the whole question broadly, and shall endeavour to point out\r\nthe general laws and subordinate causes that, in my opinion, have been at\r\nwork in bringing about the anomalous phenomena of distribution he has done\r\nso much to make known and to elucidate.\r\n\r\n_Aggressive Power of the Scandinavian Flora._--The first important fact\r\nbearing upon this question is the wonderful aggressive and colonising power\r\nof the Scandinavian flora, as shown by the way in which it establishes\r\nitself in any temperate country to which it may gain access. About 150\r\nspecies have thus established themselves in New Zealand, often taking\r\npossession of large tracts of country; about the same number are found in\r\nAustralia, and nearly as many in the Atlantic states of America, where they\r\nform the commonest weeds. Whether or not we accept Mr. Darwin's explanation\r\nof this power as due to development in the most extensive land area of the\r\nglobe where competition has been most severe and long-continued, the fact\r\nof the existence of this power remains, and we can see how important an\r\nagent it must be in the formation of the floras of any lands to which these\r\naggressive plants have been able to gain access.\r\n\r\nBut not only are these plants pre-eminently capable of holding their own in\r\nany temperate country in the world, but they also have exceptional powers\r\nof migration and {512} dispersal over seas and oceans. This is especially\r\nwell shown by the case of the Azores, where no less than 400 out of a total\r\nof 478 flowering plants are identical with European species. These islands\r\nare more than 800 miles from Europe, and, as we have already seen in\r\nChapter XII., there is no reason for supposing that they have ever been\r\nmore nearly connected with it than they are now, since an extension of the\r\nEuropean coast to the 1,000-fathom line would very little reduce the\r\ndistance. Now it is a most interesting and suggestive fact that more than\r\nhalf the European genera which occur in the Australian flora occur also in\r\nthe Azores, and in several cases even the species are identical in\r\nboth.[138] The importance of such a case as this cannot be exaggerated,\r\nbecause it affords a demonstration of the power of the very plants in\r\nquestion to pass over wide areas of sea, some no doubt wholly through the\r\nair, carried by storms in the same way as the European birds and insects\r\nwhich annually reach the Azores, others by floating on the waters, or by a\r\ncombination of the two methods; while some may have been carried by aquatic\r\nbirds, to whose feathers many seeds have the power of attaching themselves,\r\nand some even in the stomachs of fruit or seed eating birds. We have in\r\nsuch facts as these a complete disproof of the necessity for those great\r\nchanges of sea and land which are continually appealed to by those who\r\nthink land-connection the only efficient means of accounting for the\r\nmigration of animals or plants; but at the same time we do not neglect to\r\nmake the fullest use of such moderate changes as all the evidence at our\r\ncommand leads us to believe have actually occurred, and especially of the\r\nformer existence of intermediate islands, so often indicated by shoals in\r\nthe midst of the deepest oceans.\r\n\r\n_Means by which Plants have migrated from North to South._--But if plants\r\ncan thus pass in considerable numbers and variety over wide seas and\r\noceans, it must be yet more easy for them to traverse continuous areas of\r\nland, whereever mountain-chains offer suitable stations at moderate {513}\r\nintervals on which they might temporarily establish themselves. The\r\nfacilities afforded for the transmission of plants by mountains has hardly\r\nreceived sufficient attention. The numerous land-slips, the fresh surfaces\r\nof broken rock and precipice, the _debris_ of torrents, and the moraines\r\ndeposited by glaciers, afford numerous unoccupied stations on which\r\nwind-borne seeds have a good chance of germinating. It is a well-known fact\r\nthat fresh surfaces of soil or rock, such as are presented by railway\r\ncuttings and embankments, often produce plants strange to the locality,\r\nwhich survive for a few years, and then disappear as the normal vegetation\r\ngains strength and permanence.[139] But such a surface {514} will, in the\r\nmeantime, have acted as a fresh centre of dispersal; and thus a plant might\r\npass on step by step, by means of stations temporarily occupied, till it\r\nreached a district {515} where, the general conditions being more\r\nfavourable, it was able to establish itself as a permanent member of the\r\nflora. Such, generally speaking, was probably the process by which the\r\nScandinavian flora has made its way to the southern hemisphere; but it\r\ncould hardly have done so to any important extent without the aid of those\r\npowerful causes explained in our eighth chapter--causes which acted as a\r\nconstantly recurrent motive-power to produce that \"continuous current of\r\nvegetation\" from north to south across the whole width of the tropics\r\nreferred to by Sir Joseph Hooker. Those causes were, the repeated changes\r\n{516} of climate which, during all geological time, appear to have occurred\r\nin both hemispheres, culminating at rare intervals in glacial epochs, and\r\nwhich have been shown to depend upon changes of excentricity of the earth's\r\norbit and the occurrence of summer or winter in _aphelion_, in conjunction\r\nwith the slower and more irregular changes of geographical conditions;\r\nthese combined causes acting chiefly through the agency of heat-bearing\r\noceanic currents, and of snow- and ice-collecting highlands. Let us now\r\nbriefly consider how such changes would act in favouring the dispersal of\r\nplants.\r\n\r\n_Elevation and Depression of the Snow Line as Aiding the Migration of\r\nPlants._--We have endeavoured to show (in an earlier portion of this\r\nvolume) that wherever geographical or physical conditions were such as to\r\nproduce any considerable amount of perpetual snow, this would be increased\r\nwhenever a high degree of excentricity concurred with winter in _aphelion_,\r\nand diminished during the opposite phase. On all mountain ranges,\r\ntherefore, which reached above the snow-line, there would be a periodical\r\nincrease and decrease of snow, and when there were extensive areas of\r\nplateau at about the same level, the lowering of the snow-line might cause\r\nsuch an increased accumulation of snow as to produce great glaciers and\r\nice-fields, such as we have seen occurred in South Africa during the last\r\nperiod of high excentricity. But along with such depression of the line of\r\nperpetual snow there would be a corresponding depression of the alpine and\r\nsub-alpine zones suitable for the growth of an arctic and temperate\r\nvegetation, and, what is perhaps more important, the depression would\r\nnecessarily produce a great _extension_ of the area of these zones on all\r\nhigh mountains, because as we descend the average slopes become less\r\nabrupt,--thus affording a number of new stations suitable for such\r\ntemperate plants as might first reach them. But just above and below the\r\nsnow-line is the area of most powerful disintegration and denudation, from\r\nthe alternate action of frost and sun, of ice and water; and thus the more\r\nextended area would be subject to the constant occurrence of land-slips,\r\nberg-falls, and floods, with their {517} accompanying accumulations of\r\n_debris_ and of alluvial soil, affording innumerable stations in which\r\nsolitary wind-borne seeds might germinate and temporarily establish\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nThis lowering and rising of the snow-line each 10,500 years during periods\r\nof high excentricity, would occur in the northern and southern hemispheres\r\nalternately; and where there were high mountains within the tropics the two\r\nwould probably overlap each other, so that the northern depression would\r\nmake itself felt in a slight degree even across the equator some way into\r\nthe southern hemisphere, and _vice versa_; and even if the difference of\r\nthe height of perpetual snow at the two extremes did not average more than\r\na few hundred feet, this would be amply sufficient to supply the new and\r\nunoccupied stations needful to facilitate the migration of plants. It is\r\nwell known that all great mountain ranges have undergone such fluctuations,\r\nas proved by ice-marks below the present level of snow and ice.\r\n\r\nBut the differences of temperature in the two hemispheres caused by the sun\r\nbeing in _perihelion_ in the winter of the one while it was in _aphelion_\r\nduring the same season in the other, would necessarily lead to increased\r\naerial and marine currents, as already explained; and whenever geographical\r\nconditions were such as to favour the production of glaciation in any area\r\nthese effects would become more powerful, and would further aid in the\r\ndispersal of the seeds of plants.\r\n\r\n_Changes of Climate Favourable to Migration._--It is clear then, that\r\nduring periods when no glacial epochs were produced in the northern\r\nhemisphere, and even when a mild climate extended over the whole polar\r\narea, alternate changes of climate favouring the dispersal of plants would\r\noccur on all high mountains, and with particular force on such as rise\r\nabove the snow-line. But during that long-continued, though comparatively\r\nrecent, phase of high excentricity which produced an extensive glaciation\r\nin the northern hemisphere and local glaciations in the southern, these\r\nrisings and lowerings of the snow-line on all mountain ranges would have\r\nbeen at a maximum, and {518} would have been increased by the depression of\r\nthe ocean which must have arisen from such a vast bulk of water being\r\nlocked up in land-ice, and which depression would have produced the same\r\neffect as a general elevation of all the continents. At this time, too,\r\naerial currents would have attained their maximum of force in both\r\nhemispheres; and this would greatly facilitate the dispersal of all\r\nwind-borne seeds as well as of those carried in the plumage or in the\r\nstomachs of birds, since we have seen, by the cases of the Azores and\r\nBermuda, how vastly the migratory powers of birds are increased by a stormy\r\natmosphere.\r\n\r\n_Migration from North to South has been long going on._--Now, if each phase\r\nof colder and warmer mountain-climate--each alternate depression and\r\nelevation of the snow-line, only helped on the migration of a few species\r\nsome stages of the long route from the north to the south temperate\r\nregions, yet, during the long course of the Tertiary period there might\r\nwell have arisen that representation of the northern flora in the southern\r\nhemisphere which is now so conspicuous. For it is very important to remark\r\nthat it is not the existing flora alone that is represented, such as might\r\nhave been conveyed during the last glacial epoch only; but we find a whole\r\nseries of northern types evidently of varying degrees of antiquity, while\r\neven some genera characteristic of the southern hemisphere appear to have\r\nbeen originally derived from Europe. Thus Eucalyptus and Metrosideros have\r\nbeen determined by Dr. Ettingshausen from their fruits in the Eocene beds\r\nof Sheppey, while Pimelea, Leptomeria and four genera of Proteaceae have\r\nbeen recognised by Professor Heer in the Miocene of Switzerland; and the\r\nformer writer has detected fifty-five Australian forms in the Eocene plant\r\nbeds of Haering (? Belgium).[140] Then we have such peculiar genera {519}\r\nas Pachychladon and Notothlaspi of New Zealand said to have affinities with\r\nArctic plants, while Stilbocarpa--another peculiar New Zealand genus--has\r\nits nearest allies in the Himalayan and Chinese Aralias. Following these\r\nare a whole host of very distinct species of northern genera which may date\r\nback to any part of the Tertiary period, and which occur in every south\r\ntemperate land. Then we have closely allied representative species of\r\nEuropean or Arctic plants; and, lastly, a number of identical species,--and\r\nthese two classes are probably due entirely to the action of the last great\r\nglacial epoch, whose long continuance, and the repeated fluctuations of\r\nclimate with which it commenced and terminated, rendered it an agent of\r\nsufficient power to have brought about this result.\r\n\r\nHere, then, we have that constant or constantly recurrent process of\r\ndispersal acting throughout long periods with varying power--that\r\n\"continuous current of vegetation\" as it has been termed, which the facts\r\ndemand; and the extraordinary phenomenon of the species and genera of\r\nEuropean and even of Arctic plants being represented abundantly in South\r\nAmerica, Australia, and New Zealand, thus adds another to the long series\r\nof phenomena which are rendered intelligible by frequent alternations of\r\nwarmer and colder climates in either hemisphere, culminating, at long\r\nintervals and in favourable situations, in actual glacial epochs.\r\n\r\n_Geological Changes as Aiding Migration._--It will be well also to notice\r\nhere, that there is another aid to dispersion dependent upon the changes\r\neffected by denudation during the long periods included in the duration of\r\nthe species and genera of plants. A considerable number of {520} the plants\r\nof the Miocene period of Europe were so much like existing species that\r\nalthough they have generally received fresh names they may well have been\r\nidentical; and a large proportion of the vegetation during the whole\r\nTertiary period consisted of genera which are still living.[141] But from\r\nwhat is now known of the rate of sub-aerial denudation, we are sure, that\r\nduring each division of this period many mountain chains must have been\r\nconsiderably lowered, while we know that some of the existing ranges have\r\nbeen greatly elevated. Ancient volcanoes, too, have been destroyed by\r\ndenudation, and new ones have been built up, so that we may be quite sure\r\nthat ample means for the transmission of temperate plants across the\r\ntropics, may have existed in countries where they are now no longer to be\r\nfound. The great mountain masses of Guiana and Brazil, for example, must\r\nhave been far more lofty before the sedimentary covering was denuded from\r\ntheir granitic bosses and metamorphic peaks, and may have aided the\r\nsouthern migration of plants before the final elevation of the Andes. And\r\nif Africa presents us with an example of a continent of vast antiquity, we\r\nmay be sure that its great central plateaux once bore far loftier mountain\r\nranges before they were reduced to their present condition by long ages of\r\ndenudation.\r\n\r\n_Proofs of Migration by Way of the Andes._--We are now prepared to apply\r\nthe principles above laid down to the explanation of the character and\r\naffinities of the various portions of the north temperate flora in the\r\nsouthern hemisphere, and especially in Australia and New Zealand.\r\n\r\nAt the present time the only unbroken chain of highlands and mountains\r\nconnecting the Arctic and north temperate with the Antarctic lands is to be\r\nfound in the American continent, the only break of importance being the\r\ncomparatively low Isthmus of Panama, where there is {521} a distance of\r\nabout 300 miles occupied by rugged forest-clad hills, between the lofty\r\npeaks of Veragua and the northern extremity of the Andes of New Grenada.\r\nSuch distances are, as we have already seen, no barrier to the diffusion of\r\nplants; and we should accordingly expect that this great continuous\r\nmountain-chain has formed the most effective agent in aiding the southward\r\nmigration of the Arctic and north temperate vegetation. We do find, in\r\nfact, not only that a large number of northern genera and many species are\r\nscattered all along this line of route, but that at the end of the long\r\njourney, in Southern Chile and Fuegia, they have established themselves in\r\nsuch numbers as to form an important part of the flora of those countries.\r\nFrom the lists given in the works already referred to, it appears that\r\nthere are between sixty and seventy northern genera in Fuegia and Southern\r\nChile, while about forty of the species are absolutely identical with those\r\nof Europe and the Arctic regions. Considering how comparatively little the\r\nmountains of South Temperate America are yet known, this is a very\r\nremarkable result, and it proves that the transmission of species must have\r\ngone on up to comparatively recent times. Yet, as only a few of these\r\nspecies are now found along the line of migration, we see that they only\r\noccupied such stations temporarily; and we may connect their disappearance\r\nwith the passing away of the last glacial period which, by raising the\r\nsnow-line, reduced the area on which alone they could exist, and exposed\r\nthem to the competition of indigenous plants from the belt of country\r\nimmediately below them.\r\n\r\nNow, just as these numerous species and genera have undoubtedly passed\r\nalong the great American range of mountains, although only now found at its\r\ntwo extremes, so others have doubtless passed on further; and have found\r\nmore suitable stations or less severe competition in the Antarctic\r\ncontinent and islands, in New Zealand, in Tasmania, and even in Australia\r\nitself. The route by which they may have reached these countries is easily\r\nmarked out. Immediately south of Cape Horn, at a distance of only 500\r\nmiles, are the South Shetland Islands and Graham's Land, whence the\r\nAntarctic continent or a {522} group of large islands probably extends\r\nacross or around the south polar area to Victoria Land and thence to Adelie\r\nLand. The outlying Young Island, 12,000 feet high, is about 750 miles south\r\nof the Macquarie Islands, which may be considered a southern outlier of the\r\nNew Zealand group; and the Macquarie Islands are about the same distance\r\nfrom the 1,000-fathom line at a point marking the probable southern\r\nextension of Tasmania. Other islands may have existed at intermediate\r\npoints; but, even as it is, these distances are not greater than we know\r\nare traversed by plants both by flotation and by aerial currents,\r\nespecially in such a stormy atmosphere as that of the Antarctic regions.\r\nNow, we may further assume, that what we know occurred within the Arctic\r\ncircle also took place in the Antarctic--that is, that there have been\r\nalternations of climate during which some portion of what are now ice-clad\r\nlands became able to support a considerable amount of vegetation.[142]\r\nDuring such periods there would be a steady migration of plants from all\r\nsouthern circumpolar countries to people the comparatively unoccupied\r\ncontinent, and the southern extremity of America being considerably the\r\nnearest, and also being the best stocked with those northern types which\r\nhave such great powers of migration and colonisation, such plants would\r\nform the bulk of the Antarctic vegetation, and during the continuance of\r\nthe milder southern climate would occupy the whole area.\r\n\r\nWhen the cold returned and the land again became ice-clad, these plants\r\nwould be crowded towards the outer margins of the Antarctic land and its\r\nislands, and some of them would find their way across the sea to such\r\ncountries as offered on their mountain summits suitable cool stations; and\r\nas this process of alternately receiving plants from Chile and Fuegia and\r\ntransmitting them in all directions from the central Antarctic land may\r\nhave been {523} repeated several times during the Tertiary period, we have\r\nno difficulty in understanding the general community between the European\r\nand Antarctic plants found in all south temperate lands. Kerguelen's Land\r\nand The Crozets are within about the same distance from the Antarctic\r\ncontinent as New Zealand and Tasmania, and we need not therefore be\r\nsurprised at finding in each of these islands some Fuegian species which\r\nhave not reached the others. Of course, there will remain difficulties of\r\ndetail, as there always must remain, so long as our knowledge of the past\r\nchanges of the earth's surface and the history of the particular plants\r\nconcerned is so imperfect. Sir Joseph Hooker notes, for example, the\r\ncurious fact that several Compositae common to three such remote localities\r\nas the Auckland Islands, Fuegia, and Kerguelen's Land, have no pappus or\r\nseed-down, while such as have pappus are in no case common even to two of\r\nthese islands. Without knowing the exact history and distribution of the\r\ngenera to which these plants belong it would be useless to offer any\r\nconjecture, except that they are ancient forms which may have survived\r\ngreat geographical changes, or may have some peculiar and exceptional means\r\nof dispersion.\r\n\r\n_Proofs of Migration by way of the Himalayas and Southern Asia._--But\r\nalthough we may thus explain the presence of a considerable portion of the\r\nEuropean element in the floras of New Zealand and Australia, we cannot\r\naccount for the whole of it by this means, because Australia itself\r\ncontains a host of European and Asiatic genera of which we find no trace in\r\nNew Zealand or South America, or any other Antarctic land. We find, in\r\nfact, in Australia two distinct sets of European plants. First we have a\r\nnumber of species identical with those of Northern Europe or Asia (of the\r\nmost characteristic of which--thirty-eight in number--Sir Joseph Hooker\r\ngives a list); and in the second place a series of European genera usually\r\nof a somewhat more southern character, mostly represented by very distinct\r\nspecies, and all absent from New Zealand; such as Clematis, Papaver,\r\nCleome, Polygala, Lavatera, Ajuga, &c. Now of the first set--the North\r\nEuropean _species_--about three-fourths occur in some parts of America,\r\n{524} and about half in South Temperate America or New Zealand; whence we\r\nmay conclude that most of these, as well as some others, have reached\r\nAustralia by the route already indicated. The second set of\r\nAustralo-European genera, however, and many others characteristic of the\r\nSouth European or the Himalayan flora, have probably reached Australia by\r\nway of the mountains of Southern Asia, Borneo, the Moluccas, and New\r\nGuinea, at a somewhat remote period when loftier ranges and some\r\nintermediate peaks may have existed, sufficient to carry on the migration\r\nby the aid of the alternate climatal changes which are known to have\r\noccurred. The long belt of Secondary and Palaeozoic formations in East\r\nAustralia from Tasmania to Cape York continued by the lofty ranges of New\r\nGuinea, indicates the route of this immigration, and sufficiently explains\r\nhow it is that these northern types are almost wholly confined to this part\r\nof the Australian continent. Some of the earlier immigrants of this class\r\nno doubt passed over to New Zealand and now form a portion of the peculiar\r\ngenera confined to these two countries; but most of them are of later date,\r\nand have thus remained in Australia only.\r\n\r\n_Proofs of Migration by way of the African Highlands._--It is owing to this\r\ntwofold current of vegetation flowing into Australia by widely different\r\nroutes that we have in this distant land a better representation of the\r\nEuropean flora, both as regards species and genera, than in any other part\r\nof the southern hemisphere; and, so far as I can judge of the facts, there\r\nis no general phenomenon--that is, nothing in the distribution of genera\r\nand other groups of plants as opposed to cases of individual species--that\r\nis not fairly accounted for by such an origin. It further receives support\r\nfrom the case of South Africa, which also contains a large and important\r\nrepresentation of the northern flora. But here we see no indications (or\r\nvery slight ones) of that southern influx which has given Australia such a\r\ncommunity of vegetation with the Antarctic lands. There are no less than\r\nsixty _genera_ of strictly north temperate plants in South Africa, none of\r\nwhich occur in Australia; while very few of the _species_, so\r\ncharacteristic of Australia, New Zealand, and Fuegia, are found there. It\r\n{525} is clear, therefore, that South Africa has received its European\r\nplants by the direct route through the Abyssinian highlands and the lofty\r\nequatorial mountains, and mostly at a distant period when the conditions\r\nfor migration were somewhat more favourable than they are now. The much\r\ngreater directness of the route from Northern Europe to South Africa than\r\nto Australia; and the existence even now of lofty mountains and extensive\r\nhighlands for a large portion of the distance, will explain (what Sir\r\nJoseph Hooker notes as \"a very curious fact\") why South Africa has more\r\nvery northern European _genera_ than Australia, while Australia has more\r\nidentical _species_ and a better representation on the whole of the\r\nEuropean flora--this being clearly due to the large influx of species it\r\nhas received from the Antarctic Islands, in addition to those which have\r\nentered it by way of Asia. The greater distance of South Africa even now\r\nfrom any of these islands, and the much deeper sea to the south of the\r\nAfrican continent, than in the case of Tasmania and New Zealand, indicating\r\na smaller recent extension southward, is all quite in harmony with the\r\nfacts of distribution of the northern flora above referred to.\r\n\r\n_Supposed Connection of South Africa and Australia._--There remains,\r\nhowever, the small amount of direct affinity between the vegetation of\r\nSouth Africa and that of Australia, New Zealand, and Temperate South\r\nAmerica, consisting in all of fifteen genera, five of which are confined to\r\nAustralia and South Africa, while several natural orders are better\r\nrepresented in these two countries than in any other part of the world.\r\nThis resemblance has been supposed to imply some former land-connection of\r\nall the great southern lands, but it appears to me that any such\r\nsupposition is wholly unnecessary. The differences between the faunas and\r\nfloras of these countries are too great and too radical to render it\r\npossible that any such connection should have existed except at a very\r\nremote period. But if we have to go back so far for an explanation, a much\r\nsimpler one presents itself, and one more in accordance with what we have\r\nlearnt of the general permanence of deep oceans and the great changes that\r\nhave taken place {526} in the distribution of all forms of life. Just as we\r\nexplain the presence of marsupials in Australia and America and of\r\nCentetidae in Madagascar and the Antilles, by the preservation in these\r\nlocalities of remnants of once wide-spread types, so we should prefer to\r\nconsider the few genera common to Australia and South Africa as remnants of\r\nan ancient vegetation, once spread over the northern hemisphere, driven\r\nsouthward by the pressure of more specialised types, and now finding a\r\nrefuge in these two widely separated southern lands. It is suggestive of\r\nsuch an explanation that these genera are either of very ancient groups--as\r\nConifers and Cycads--or plants of low organisation as the Restiaceae--or of\r\nworld-wide distribution, as Melanthaceae.\r\n\r\n_The Endemic Genera of Plants in New Zealand._--Returning now to the New\r\nZealand flora, with which we are more especially concerned, there only\r\nremains to be considered the peculiar or endemic genera which characterise\r\nit. These are thirty-two in number, and are mostly very isolated. A few\r\nhave affinities with Arctic groups, others with Himalayan, or Australian\r\ngenera; several are tropical forms, but the majority appear to be\r\naltogether peculiar types of world-wide groups--as Leguminosae,\r\nSaxifrageae, Compositae, Orchideae, &c. We must evidently trace back these\r\npeculiar forms to the earliest immigrants, either from the north or from\r\nthe south; and the great antiquity we are obliged to give to New\r\nZealand--an antiquity supported by every feature in its fauna and flora, no\r\nless than by its geological structure, and its extinct forms of\r\nlife[143]--affords ample time for the changes in the general distribution\r\nof plants, and for those due to isolation and modification under {527} the\r\ninfluence of changed conditions, which are manifested by the extreme\r\npeculiarity of many of these interesting endemic forms.\r\n\r\n_The Absence of Southern Types from the Northern Hemisphere._--We have now\r\nonly to notice the singular want of reciprocity in the migrations of\r\nnorthern and southern types of vegetation. In return for the vast number of\r\nEuropean plants which have reached Australia, not one single Australian\r\nplant has entered any part of the north temperate zone, and the same may be\r\nsaid of the typical southern vegetation in general, whether developed in\r\nthe Antarctic lands, New Zealand, South America, or South Africa. The\r\nfurthest northern outliers of the southern flora are a few genera of\r\nAntarctic type on the Bornean Alps; the genus Acaena which has a species in\r\nCalifornia; two representatives of the Australian flora--Casuarina and\r\nStylidium, in the peninsula of India; while China and the Philippines have\r\ntwo strictly Australian genera of Orchideae--Microtis and Thelymitra, as\r\nwell as a Restiaceous genus. Several distinct causes appear to have\r\ncombined to produce this curious inability of the southern flora to make\r\nits way into the northern hemisphere. The primary cause is, no doubt, the\r\ntotally different distribution of land in the two hemispheres, so that in\r\nthe south there is the minimum of land in the colder parts of the temperate\r\nzone and in the north the maximum. This is well shown by the fact that on\r\nthe parallel of Lat. 50deg N. we pass over 240deg of land or shallow sea,\r\nwhile on the same parallel of south latitude we have only 4deg, where we\r\ncross the southern part of Patagonia. Again the three most important south\r\ntemperate land-areas--South Temperate America, South Africa, and\r\nAustralia--are widely separated from each other, and have in all\r\nprobability always been so; whereas the whole of the north temperate lands\r\nare practically continuous. It follows that, instead of the enormous\r\nnorthern area, in which highly organised and dominant groups of plants have\r\nbeen developed gifted with great colonising and aggressive powers, we have\r\nin the south three comparatively small and detached areas, in which rich\r\nfloras have been developed with _special_ {528} adaptations to soil,\r\nclimate, and organic environment, but comparatively impotent and inferior\r\nbeyond their own domain.\r\n\r\nAnother circumstance which makes the contest between the northern and\r\nsouthern forms still more unequal, is the much greater hardiness of the\r\nformer, from having been developed in a colder region, and one where alpine\r\nand arctic conditions extensively prevail; whereas the southern floras have\r\nbeen mainly developed in mild regions to which they have been altogether\r\nconfined. While the northern plants have been driven north or south by each\r\nsucceeding change of climate, the southern species have undergone\r\ncomparatively slight changes of this nature, owing to the areas they occupy\r\nbeing unconnected with the ice-bearing Antarctic continent. It follows,\r\nthat whereas the northern plants find in all these southern lands a milder\r\nand more equable climate than that to which they have been accustomed, and\r\nare thus often able to grow and flourish even more vigorously than in their\r\nnative land, the southern plants would find in almost every part of Europe,\r\nNorth America or Northern Asia, a more severe and less equable climate,\r\nwith winters that usually prove fatal to them even under cultivation. These\r\ncauses, taken separately, are very powerful, but when combined they must, I\r\nthink, be held to be amply sufficient to explain why examples of the\r\ntypical southern vegetation are almost unknown in the north temperate zone,\r\nwhile a very few of them have extended so far as the northern tropic.[144]\r\n\r\n{529}\r\n\r\n_Concluding Remarks on the Last Two Chapters._--Our inquiry into the\r\nexternal relations and probable origin of the fauna and flora of New\r\nZealand, has thus led us on to a general theory as to the cause of the\r\npeculiar biological relations between the northern and the southern\r\nhemispheres; and no better or more typical example could be found of the\r\nwide range and great interest of the study of the geographical distribution\r\nof animals and plants.\r\n\r\nThe solution which has here been given of one of the most difficult of this\r\nclass of problems, has been rendered possible solely by the knowledge very\r\nrecently obtained of the form of the sea-bottom in the southern ocean, and\r\nof the geological structure of the great Australian continent. Without this\r\nknowledge we should have nothing but a series of guesses or probabilities\r\non which to found our hypothetical explanation, which we have now been able\r\nto build up on a solid foundation of fact. The complete separation of East\r\nfrom West Australia during a portion of the Cretaceous and Tertiary\r\nperiods, could never have been guessed till it was established by the\r\nlaborious explorations of the Australian geologists; while the hypothesis\r\nof a comparatively shallow sea, uniting New Zealand by a long route with\r\ntropical Australia, while a profoundly deep ocean always separated it from\r\ntemperate Australia, would have been rejected as too improbable a\r\nsupposition for the foundation of even the most enticing theory. Yet it is\r\nmainly by means of these two facts, that we are enabled to give an adequate\r\nexplanation of the strange anomalies in the flora of Australia and its\r\nrelation to that of New Zealand.\r\n\r\nIn the more general explanation of the relations of the various northern\r\nand southern floras, I have shown what an important aid to any such\r\nexplanation is the theory of repeated changes of climate, not necessarily\r\nof great amount, given in Chapters VIII. and IX.; while the whole\r\ndiscussion justifies the importance attached to the theory of the general\r\npermanence of continents and oceans, as demonstrated in Chapter VI., since\r\nany rational explanation based upon facts (as opposed to mere unsupported\r\n{530} conjecture) must take such general permanence as a starting-point.\r\nThe whole inquiry into the phenomena presented by islands, which forms the\r\nmain subject of the present volume has, I think, shown that this theory\r\ndoes afford a firm foundation for the discussion of questions of\r\ndistribution and dispersal; and that by its aid, combined with a clear\r\nperception of the wonderful powers of dispersion and modification in the\r\norganic world when long periods are considered, the most difficult problems\r\nconnected with this subject cease to be insoluble.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{531}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\nSUMMARY AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\n    The Present Volume is the Development and Application of a\r\n    Theory--Statement of the Biological and Physical Causes of\r\n    Dispersal--Investigation of the Facts of Dispersal--of the Means of\r\n    Dispersal--of Geographical Changes Affecting Dispersal--of Climatal\r\n    Changes Affecting Dispersal--The Glacial Epoch and its Causes--Alleged\r\n    Ancient Glacial Epochs--Warm Polar Climates and their\r\n    Causes--Conclusions as to Geological Climates--How far Different from\r\n    those of Mr. Croll--Supposed Limitations of Geological Time--Time Amply\r\n    Sufficient both for Geological and Biological Development--Insular\r\n    Faunas and Floras--The North Atlantic Islands--The Galapagos--St.\r\n    Helena and the Sandwich Islands--Great Britain as a Recent Continental\r\n    Island--Borneo and Java--Japan and Formosa--Madagascar as an Ancient\r\n    Continental Island--Celebes and New Zealand as Anomalous Islands--The\r\n    Flora of New Zealand and its Origin--The European Element in the South\r\n    Temperate Floras--Concluding Remarks.\r\n\r\nThe present volume has gone over a very wide field both of facts and\r\ntheories, and it will be well to recall these to the reader's attention and\r\npoint out their connection with each other, in a concluding chapter. I hope\r\nto be able to show that, although at first sight somewhat fragmentary and\r\ndisconnected, this work is really the development of a clear and definite\r\ntheory, and its application to the solution of a number of biological\r\nproblems. That theory is, briefly, that the distribution of the various\r\nspecies and groups of living things over the earth's surface, and their\r\naggregation in definite assemblages in certain areas, is the {532} direct\r\nresult and outcome of a complex set of causes, which may be grouped as\r\n\"biological\" and \"physical.\" The biological causes are mainly of two\r\nkinds--firstly, the constant tendency of all organisms to increase in\r\nnumbers and to occupy a wider area, and their various powers of dispersion\r\nand migration through which, when unchecked, they are enabled to spread\r\nwidely over the globe; and, secondly, those laws of evolution and\r\nextinction which determine the manner in which groups of organisms arise\r\nand grow, reach their maximum, and then dwindle away, often breaking up\r\ninto separate portions which long survive in very remote regions. The\r\nphysical causes are also mainly of two kinds. We have, first, the\r\ngeographical changes which at one time isolate a whole fauna and flora, at\r\nanother time lead to their dispersal and intermixture with adjacent faunas\r\nand floras--and it was here important to ascertain and define the exact\r\nnature and extent of these changes, and to determine the question of the\r\ngeneral stability or instability of continents and oceans; in the second\r\nplace, it was necessary to determine the exact nature, extent and frequency\r\nof the changes of climate which have occurred in various parts of the\r\nearth,--because such changes are among the most powerful agents in causing\r\nthe dispersal and extinction of plants and animals. Hence the importance\r\nattached to the question of geological climates and their causes, which\r\nhave been here investigated at some length with the aid of the most recent\r\nresearches of geologists, physicists, and explorers. These various\r\ninquiries led on to an investigation of the mode of formation of stratified\r\ndeposits, with a view to fix within some limits their probable age; and\r\nalso to an estimate of the probable rate of development of the organic\r\nworld; and both these processes are shown to involve, so far as we can\r\njudge, periods of time less vast than have generally been thought\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nThe numerous facts and theories established in the First Part of the work\r\nare then applied to explain the phenomena presented by the floras and\r\nfaunas of the chief islands of the globe, which are classified, in\r\naccordance with their physical origin, in three groups or classes, each\r\n{533} of which are shown to exhibit certain well-marked biological\r\nfeatures.\r\n\r\nHaving thus shown that the work is a connected whole, founded on the\r\nprinciple of tracing out the more recondite causes of the distribution of\r\norganisms, we will briefly indicate the scope and object of the several\r\nchapters, by means of which this general conception has been carried out.\r\n\r\nBeginning with simple and familiar facts relating to British and European\r\nquadrupeds and birds, I have defined and shown the exact character of\r\n\"areas of distribution,\" as applied to species, genera, and families, and\r\nhave illustrated the subject by maps showing the peculiarities of\r\ndistribution of some well-known groups of birds. Taking then our British\r\nmammals and land-birds, I follow them over the whole area they inhabit, and\r\nthus obtain a foundation for the establishment of \"zoological regions,\" and\r\na clear insight into their character as distinct from the usual\r\ngeographical divisions of the globe.\r\n\r\nThe facts thus far established are then shown to be necessary results of\r\nthe \"law of evolution.\" The nature and amount of \"variation\" is exhibited\r\nby a number of curious examples; the origin, growth, and decay of species\r\nand genera are traced, and all the interesting phenomena of isolated groups\r\nand discontinuous generic and specific areas are shown to follow as logical\r\nconsequences.\r\n\r\nThe next subject investigated is the means by which the various groups of\r\nanimals are enabled to overcome the natural barriers which often seem to\r\nlimit them to very restricted areas, how far those barriers are themselves\r\nliable to be altered or abolished, and what is the exact nature and amount\r\nof the changes of sea and land which our earth has undergone in past times.\r\nThis latter part of the inquiry is shown to be the most important as it is\r\nthe most fundamental; and as it is still a subject of controversy, and many\r\nerroneous views prevail in regard to it, it is discussed at some length.\r\nSeveral distinct classes of evidence are adduced to prove that the grand\r\nfeatures of our globe--the position of the great oceans {534} and the chief\r\nland-areas--have remained, on the whole, unchanged throughout geological\r\ntime. Our continents are shown to be built up mainly of \"shore-deposits\";\r\nand even the chalk, which is so often said to be the exact equivalent of\r\nthe \"globigerina ooze\" now forming in mid-Atlantic, is shown to be a\r\ncomparatively shallow-water deposit formed in inland seas, or in the\r\nimmediate vicinity of land. The general stability of continents has,\r\nhowever, been accompanied by constant changes of form, and insular\r\nconditions have prevailed over every part in succession; and the effect of\r\nsuch changes on the distribution of organisms is pointed out.\r\n\r\nWe then approach the consideration of another set of changes--those of\r\nclimate--which have probably been agents of the first importance in\r\nmodifying the specific forms as well as the distribution of animals. Here\r\nagain we find ourselves in the midst of fierce controversies. The\r\noccurrence of a recent glacial epoch of great severity in the northern\r\nhemisphere is now universally admitted, but the causes which brought it on\r\nare matter of dispute. But unless we can arrive at these causes, as well as\r\nat those which produced the equally well demonstrated mild climate in the\r\nArctic regions, we shall be quite unable to determine the nature and amount\r\nof the changes of climate which have occurred throughout past ages, and\r\nshall thus be left without a most important clue to the explanation of many\r\nof the anomalies in the distribution of animals and plants.\r\n\r\nI have therefore devoted three chapters to a full investigation of this\r\nquestion. I have first given such a sketch of the most salient facts as to\r\nrender the phenomena of the glacial epoch clear and intelligible. I then\r\nreview the various suggested explanations, and, taking up the two which\r\nalone seem tenable, I endeavour to determine the true principles of each.\r\nWhile adopting generally Mr. Croll's views as to the causes of the \"glacial\r\nepoch,\" I have introduced certain limitations and modifications. I have\r\npointed out, I believe, more clearly than has hitherto been done, the very\r\ndifferent effects on climate of water in the liquid and in the solid state;\r\nand I have {535} shown, by a variety of evidence, that without high land\r\nthere can be no permanent snow and ice. From these facts and principles the\r\nvery important conclusion is reached, that the alternate phases of\r\nprecession--causing the winter of each hemisphere to be in _aphelion_ and\r\n_perihelion_ each 10,500 years--would produce a complete change of climate\r\nonly where a country was _partially_ snow-clad; while, whenever a large\r\narea became almost _wholly_ buried in snow and ice--as was certainly the\r\ncase with Northern Europe and America during the glacial epoch--then the\r\nglacial conditions would be continued and perhaps even intensified when the\r\nsun approached nearest to the earth in winter, instead of there being at\r\nthat time, as Mr. Croll maintains, an almost perpetual spring. This\r\nimportant result is supported by reference to the existing differences\r\nbetween the climates of the northern and southern hemispheres, and by what\r\nis known to have occurred during the last glacial epoch; and it is shown to\r\nbe in complete harmony with the geological evidence as to interglacial mild\r\nperiods.\r\n\r\nDiscussing next the evidence for glacial epochs in earlier times, it is\r\nshown that Mr. Croll's views are opposed by a vast body of facts, and that\r\nthe geological evidence leads irresistibly to the conclusion that during a\r\nlarge portion of the Secondary and Tertiary periods, uninterrupted warm\r\nclimates prevailed in the north temperate zone, and so far ameliorated the\r\nclimate of the Arctic regions as to admit of the growth of a luxuriant\r\nvegetation in the highest latitudes yet explored. The geographical\r\ncondition of the northern hemisphere at these periods is then investigated,\r\nand it is shown to have been probably such as to admit the warm tropical\r\nwaters freely to penetrate the land, and to reach the Arctic seas by\r\nseveral channels; and, adopting Mr. Croll's calculations as to the enormous\r\nquantity of heat that would thus be conveyed northwards, it is maintained\r\nthat the mild Arctic climates are amply accounted for. With such favourable\r\ngeographical conditions, it is shown, that changes of excentricity and of\r\nthe phases of precession would have no other effect than to cause greater\r\ndifferences {536} of temperature between summer and winter; but, wherever\r\nthere was a considerable extent of very lofty mountains the snow-line would\r\nbe lowered, and the snow-collecting area being thus largely increased a\r\nconsiderable amount of local glaciation might result. Thus may be explained\r\nthe presence of enormous ice-borne rocks in Eocene and Miocene times in\r\nCentral Europe, while at the very same period all the surrounding country\r\nenjoyed a tropical or sub-tropical climate.\r\n\r\nThe general conclusion is thus reached, that geographical conditions are\r\nthe essential causes of great changes of climate, and that the radically\r\ndifferent distribution of land and sea in the northern and southern\r\nhemispheres has generally led to great diversity of climate in the Arctic\r\nand Antarctic regions. The form and arrangement of the continents is shown\r\nto be such as to favour the transfer of warm oceanic currents to the north\r\nfar in excess of those which move towards the south, and whenever these\r\ncurrents had free passage _through_ the northern land-masses to the polar\r\narea, a mild climate must have prevailed over the whole northern\r\nhemisphere. It is only in very recent times that the great northern\r\ncontinents have become so completely consolidated as they now are, thus\r\nshutting out the warm water from their interiors, and rendering possible a\r\nwide-spread and intense glacial epoch. But this great climatal change was\r\nactually brought about by the high excentricity which occurred about\r\n200,000 years ago; and it is doubtful if a similar glaciation in equally\r\nlow latitudes could be produced by means of any such geographical\r\ncombinations as actually occur, without the concurrence of a high\r\nexcentricity.\r\n\r\nA survey of the present condition of the earth supports this view, for\r\nthough we have enormous mountain ranges in every latitude, there is no\r\nglaciated country south of Greenland in N. Lat. 61deg. But directly we go\r\nback a very short period, we find the superficial evidences of glaciation\r\nto an enormous extent over three-fourths of the globe. In the Alps and\r\nPyrenees, in the British Isles and Scandinavia, in Spain and the Atlas, in\r\nthe Caucasus {537} and the Himalayas, in Eastern North America and west of\r\nthe Rocky Mountains, in the Andes of South Temperate America, in South\r\nAfrica, and in New Zealand, huge moraines and other unmistakable ice-marks\r\nattest the universal descent of the snow-line for several thousand feet\r\nbelow its present level. If we reject the influence of high excentricity as\r\nthe cause of this almost universal glaciation, we must postulate a general\r\nelevation of _all_ these mountains about the same time, geologically\r\nspeaking--for the general similarity in the state of preservation of the\r\nice-marks and the known activity of denudation as a destroying agent,\r\nforbid the idea that they belong to widely separated epochs. It has,\r\nindeed, been suggested, that denudation alone has lowered these mountains\r\nso much during the post-tertiary epoch, that they were previously of\r\nsufficient height to account for the glaciation of all of them; but this\r\nhardly needs refutation, for it is clear that denudation could not at the\r\nsame time have removed some thousands of feet of rock from many hundreds of\r\nsquare miles of lofty snow-collecting plateaus, and yet have left moraines,\r\nand blocks, and even glacial striae, undisturbed and uneffaced on the\r\nslopes and in the valleys of these same mountains.\r\n\r\nThe theory of geological climates set forth in this volume, while founded\r\non Mr. Croll's researches, differs from all that have yet been made public,\r\nin clearly tracing out the comparative influence of geographical and\r\nastronomical revolutions, showing that, while the former have been the\r\nchief, if not the exclusive, causes of the long-continued mild climates of\r\nthe Arctic regions, the concurrence of the latter has been essential to the\r\nproduction of glacial epochs in the temperate zones, as well as of those\r\nlocal glaciations in low latitudes, of which there is such an abundance of\r\nevidence.\r\n\r\nThe next question discussed is that of geological time as bearing on the\r\ndevelopment of the organic world. The periods of time usually demanded by\r\ngeologists have been very great, and it was often assumed that there was no\r\noccasion to limit them. But the theory of development demands far more; for\r\nthe earliest fossiliferous rocks {538} prove the existence of many and\r\nvaried forms of life which require unrecorded ages for their\r\ndevelopment--ages probably far longer than those which have elapsed from\r\nthat period to the present day. The physicists, however, deny that any such\r\nindefinitely long periods are available. The sun is ever losing heat far\r\nmore rapidly than it can be renewed from any known or conceivable source.\r\nThe earth is a cooling body, and must once have been too hot to support\r\nlife; while the friction of the tides is checking the earth's rotation, and\r\nthis cannot have gone on indefinitely without making our day much longer\r\nthan it is. A limit is therefore placed to the age of the habitable earth,\r\nand it has been thought that the time so allowed is not sufficient for the\r\nlong processes of geological change and organic development. It is\r\ntherefore important to inquire whether these processes are either of them\r\nso excessively slow as has been supposed, and I devote a chapter to the\r\ninquiry.\r\n\r\nGeologists have measured with some accuracy the maximum thickness of all\r\nthe known sedimentary rocks. The rate of denudation has also been recently\r\nmeasured by a method which, if not precise, at all events gives results of\r\nthe right order of magnitude and which err on the side of being too slow\r\nrather than too fast. If, then, the _maximum_ thickness of the _known_\r\nsedimentary rocks is taken to represent the _average_ thickness of _all_\r\nthe sedimentary rocks, and we also know the _amount_ of sediment carried to\r\nthe sea or lakes, and the _area_ over which that sediment is spread, we\r\nhave a means of calculating the _time_ required for the building up of all\r\nthe sedimentary rocks of the geological system. I have here inquired how\r\nfar the above suppositions are correct, or on which side they probably err;\r\nand the conclusion arrived at is, that the time required is very much less\r\nthan has hitherto been supposed.\r\n\r\nAnother estimate is afforded by the date of the last glacial epoch if\r\ncoincident with the last period of high excentricity, while the Alpine\r\nglaciation of the Miocene period is assumed to have been caused by the next\r\nearlier phase of very high excentricity. Taking these as data, the {539}\r\nproportionate change of the species of mollusca affords a means of arriving\r\nat the whole lapse of time represented by the fossiliferous rocks; and\r\nthese two estimates agree in the _order_ of their magnitudes.\r\n\r\nIt is then argued that the changes of climate every 10,500 years during the\r\nnumerous periods of high excentricity have acted as a motive power in\r\nhastening on both geological and biological change. By raising and lowering\r\nthe snow-line in all mountain ranges it has caused increased denudation;\r\nwhile the same changes have caused much migration and disturbance in the\r\norganic world, and have thus tended to the more rapid modification of\r\nspecies. The present epoch being a period of very low excentricity, the\r\nearth is in a phase of _exceptional stability_ both physical and organic;\r\nand it is from this period of exceptional stability that our notions of the\r\nvery slow rate of change have been derived.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion is, on the whole, that the periods allowed by physicists are\r\nnot only far in excess of such as are required for geological and organic\r\nchange, but that they allow ample margin for a lapse of time anterior to\r\nthe deposit of the earliest fossiliferous rocks several times longer than\r\nthe time which has elapsed since their deposit to the present day.\r\n\r\nHaving thus laid the foundation for a scientific interpretation of the\r\nphenomena of distribution, we proceed to the Second Part of our work--the\r\ndiscussion of a series of typical Insular Faunas and Floras with a view to\r\nexplain the interesting phenomena they present. Taking first two North\r\nAtlantic groups--the Azores and Bermuda--it is shown how important an agent\r\nin the dispersal of most animals and plants is a stormy atmosphere.\r\nAlthough 900 and 700 miles respectively from the nearest continents, their\r\nproductions are very largely identical with those of Europe and America;\r\nand, what is more important, fresh arrivals of birds, insects, and plants,\r\nare now taking place almost annually. These islands afford, therefore, test\r\nexamples of the great dispersive powers of certain groups of organisms, and\r\nthus serve as a basis on which to found our explanations of many anomalies\r\nof distribution. Passing {540} on to the Galapagos we have a group less\r\ndistant from a continent and of larger area, yet, owing to special\r\nconditions, of which the comparatively stormless equatorial atmosphere is\r\nthe most important, exhibiting far more speciality in its productions than\r\nthe more distant Azores. Still, however, its fauna and flora are as\r\nunmistakably derived from the American continent as those of the Azores are\r\nfrom the European.\r\n\r\nWe next take St. Helena and the Sandwich Islands, both wonderfully isolated\r\nin the midst of vast oceans, and no longer exhibiting in their productions\r\nan exclusive affinity to one continent. Here we have to recognise the\r\nresults of immense antiquity, and of those changes of geography, of\r\nclimate, and in the general distribution of organisms which we know have\r\noccurred in former geological epochs, and whose causes and consequences we\r\nhave discussed in the first part of our volume. This concludes our review\r\nof the Oceanic Islands.\r\n\r\nComing now to Continental Islands we consider first those of most recent\r\norigin and offering the simplest phenomena; and begin with the British\r\nIsles as affording the best example of very recent and well known\r\nContinental Islands. Reviewing the interesting past history of Britain, we\r\nshow why it is comparatively poor in species and why this poverty is still\r\ngreater in Ireland. By a careful examination of its fauna and flora it is\r\nthen shown that the British Isles are not so completely identical,\r\nbiologically, with the continent as has been supposed. A considerable\r\namount of speciality is shown to exist, and that this speciality is real\r\nand not apparent is supported by the fact, that small outlying islands,\r\nsuch as the Isle of Man, the Shetland Isles, Lundy Island, and the Isle of\r\nWight, all possess certain species or varieties not found elsewhere.\r\n\r\nBorneo and Java are next taken, as illustrations of tropical islands which\r\nmay be not more ancient than Britain, but which, owing to their much larger\r\narea, greater distance from the continent, and the extreme richness of the\r\nequatorial fauna and flora, possess a large proportion of peculiar species,\r\nthough these are in general very closely allied to those of the adjacent\r\nparts of Asia. The {541} preliminary studies we have made enable us to\r\nafford a simpler and more definite interpretation of the peculiar relations\r\nof Java to the continent and its differences from Borneo and Sumatra, than\r\nwas given in my former work (_The Geographical Distribution of Animals_).\r\n\r\nJapan and Formosa are next taken, as examples of islands which are\r\ndecidedly somewhat more ancient than those previously considered, and which\r\npresent a number of very interesting phenomena, especially in their\r\nrelations to each other, and to remote rather than to adjacent parts of the\r\nAsiatic continent.\r\n\r\nWe now pass to the group of Ancient Continental Islands, of which\r\nMadagascar is the most typical example. It is surrounded by a number of\r\nsmaller islands which may be termed its satellites since they partake of\r\nmany of its peculiarities; though some of these--as the Comoros and\r\nSeychelles--may be considered continental, while others--as Bourbon,\r\nMauritius, and Rodriguez--are decidedly oceanic. In order to understand the\r\npeculiarities of the Madagascar fauna we have to consider the past history\r\nof the African and Asiatic continents, which it is shown are such as to\r\naccount for all the main peculiarities of the fauna of these islands\r\nwithout having recourse to the hypothesis of a now-submerged Lemurian\r\ncontinent. Considerable evidence is further adduced to show that \"Lemuria\"\r\nis a myth, since not only is its existence unnecessary, but it can be\r\nproved that it would not explain the actual facts of distribution. The\r\norigin of the interesting Mascarene wingless birds is discussed, and the\r\nmain peculiarities of the remarkable flora of Madagascar and the Mascarene\r\nislands pointed out; while it is shown that all these phenomena are to be\r\nexplained on the general principles of the permanence of the great oceans\r\nand the comparatively slight fluctuations of the land area, and by taking\r\naccount of established palaeontological facts.\r\n\r\nThere remain two other islands--Celebes and New Zealand--which are classed\r\nas \"anomalous,\" the one because it is almost impossible to place it in any\r\nof the six zoological regions, or determine whether it has ever been\r\nactually joined to a continent--the other because it {542} combines the\r\ncharacteristics of continental and oceanic islands.\r\n\r\nThe peculiarities of the Celebesian fauna have already been dwelt upon in\r\nseveral previous works, but they are so remarkable and so unique that they\r\ncannot be omitted in a treatise on \"Insular Faunas\"; and here, as in the\r\ncase of Borneo and Java, fuller consideration and the application of the\r\ngeneral principles laid down in our First Part, lead to a solution of the\r\nproblem at once more simple and more satisfactory than any which have been\r\npreviously proposed. I now look upon Celebes as an outlying portion of the\r\ngreat Asiatic continent of Miocene times, which either by submergence or\r\nsome other cause had lost the greater portion of its animal inhabitants,\r\nand since then has remained more or less completely isolated from every\r\nother land. It has thus preserved a fragment of a very ancient fauna along\r\nwith a number of later types which have reached it from surrounding islands\r\nby the ordinary means of dispersal. This sufficiently explains all the\r\npeculiar _affinities_ of its animals, though the peculiar and distinctive\r\n_characters_ of some of them remain as mysterious as ever.\r\n\r\nNew Zealand is shown to be so completely continental in its geological\r\nstructure, and its numerous wingless birds so clearly imply a former\r\nconnection with some other land (as do its numerous lizards and its\r\nremarkable reptile, the Hatteria), that the total absence of indigenous\r\nland-mammalia was hardly to be expected. Some attention is therefore given\r\nto the curious animal which has been seen but never captured, and this is\r\nshown to be probably identical with an animal referred to by Captain Cook.\r\nThe more accurate knowledge which has recently been obtained of the sea\r\nbottom around New Zealand enables us to determine that the former\r\nconnection of that island with Australia was towards the north, and this is\r\nfound to agree well with many of the peculiarities of its fauna.\r\n\r\nThe flora of New Zealand and that of Australia are now both so well known,\r\nand they present so many peculiarities, and relations of so anomalous a\r\ncharacter, {543} as to present in Sir Joseph Hooker's opinion an almost\r\ninsoluble problem. Much additional information on the physical and\r\ngeological history of these two countries has, however, been obtained since\r\nthe appearance of Sir Joseph Hooker's works, and I therefore determined to\r\napply to them the same method of discussion and treatment which has been\r\nusually successful with similar problems in the case of animals. The fact\r\nabove noted, that New Zealand was connected with Australia in its northern\r\nand tropical portion only, of itself affords a clue to one portion of the\r\nspecialities of the New Zealand flora--the presence of an unusual number of\r\ntropical families and genera, while the temperate forms consist mainly of\r\nspecies either identical with those found in Australia or closely allied to\r\nthem. But a still more important clue is obtained in the geological\r\nstructure of Australia itself, which is shown to have been for long periods\r\ndivided into an eastern and a western island, in the latter of which the\r\nhighly peculiar flora of temperate Australia was developed. This is found\r\nto explain with great exactness the remarkable absence from New Zealand of\r\nall the most abundant and characteristic Australian genera, both of plants\r\nand of animals, since these existed at that time only in the _western_\r\nisland, while New Zealand was in connection with the _eastern_ island alone\r\nand with the tropical portion of it. From these geological and physical\r\nfacts, and the known powers of dispersal of plants, all the main features,\r\nand many of the detailed peculiarities of the New Zealand flora are shown\r\nnecessarily to result.\r\n\r\nOur last chapter is devoted to a wider, and if possible more interesting\r\nsubject--the origin of the European element in the floras of New Zealand\r\nand Australia, and also in those of South America and South Africa. This is\r\nso especially a botanical question, that it was with some diffidence I\r\nentered upon it, yet it arose so naturally from the study of the New\r\nZealand and Australian floras, and seemed to have so much light thrown upon\r\nit by our preliminary studies as to changes of climate and the causes which\r\nhave favoured the distribution of plants, that I felt my work would be\r\nincomplete without a consideration of {544} it. The subject will be so\r\nfresh in the reader's mind that a complete summary of it is unnecessary. I\r\nventure to think, however, that I have shown, not only the several routes\r\nby which the northern plants have reached the various southern lands, but\r\nhave pointed out the special aids to their migration, and the motive power\r\nwhich has urged them on.\r\n\r\nIn this discussion, if nowhere else, will be found a complete justification\r\nof that lengthy investigation of the exact nature of past changes of\r\nclimate, which to some readers may have seemed unnecessary and unsuited to\r\nsuch a work as the present. Without the clear and definite conclusions\r\narrived at by that discussion, and those equally important views as to the\r\npermanence of the great features of the earth's surface, and the wonderful\r\ndispersive powers of plants which have been so frequently brought before us\r\nin our studies of insular floras, I should not have ventured to attack the\r\nwide and difficult problem of the northern element in southern floras.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn concluding a work dealing with subjects which have occupied my attention\r\nfor many years, I trust that the reader who has followed me throughout will\r\nbe imbued with the conviction that ever presses upon myself, of the\r\ncomplete interdependence of organic and inorganic nature. Not only does the\r\nmarvellous structure of each organised being involve the whole past history\r\nof the earth, but such apparently unimportant facts as the presence of\r\ncertain types of plants or animals in one island rather than in another,\r\nare now shown to be dependent on the long series of past geological\r\nchanges--on those marvellous astronomical revolutions which cause a\r\nperiodic variation of terrestrial climates--on the apparently fortuitous\r\naction of storms and currents in the conveyance of germs--and on the\r\nendlessly varied actions and reactions of organised beings on each other.\r\nAnd although these various causes are far too complex in their combined\r\naction to enable us to follow them out in the case of any one species, yet\r\ntheir broad results are clearly recognisable; and we are thus encouraged to\r\nstudy more completely every detail and {545} every anomaly in the\r\ndistribution of living things, in the firm conviction that by so doing we\r\nshall obtain a fuller and clearer insight into the course of nature, and\r\nwith increased confidence that the \"mighty maze\" of Being we see everywhere\r\naround us is \"not without a plan.\"\r\n\r\n{549}\r\n\r\n        INDEX\r\n\r\n          A.\r\n  Acacia, wide range of in Australia, 185\r\n  _Acacia heterophylla_, and _Acacia koa_, 443\r\n  Acaena in California, 527\r\n  _Accipiter hawaii_, 314\r\n  Achatinellinae, average range of, 317\r\n  _Aegialitis sanctae-helenae_, 305\r\n  Africa, characteristic mammalia of, 416\r\n    former isolation of, 418\r\n  Africa and Madagascar, relations of, 418\r\n    early history of, 419\r\n  African highlands as aiding the migration of plants, 524\r\n  African reptiles absent from Madagascar, 418\r\n  Aggressive power of the Scandinavian flora, 511\r\n  Air and water, properties of, in relation to climate, 131\r\n  _Alectoraenas pulcherrimus_, 429\r\n  Allen, Mr. J.

All these expeditions combined have done far\r\nless than private collectors in making known the products of remote lands\r\nand islands. They have brought home fragmentary collections, made in widely\r\nscattered localities, and these have been usually described in huge folios\r\nor quartos, whose value is often in inverse proportion to their bulk and\r\ncost. The same species have been collected again and again, often described\r\nseveral times over under new names, and not unfrequently stated to be from\r\nplaces they never inhabited. The result of this wretched system is that the\r\nproductions of some of the most frequently visited and most interesting\r\nislands on the globe are still very imperfectly known, while their native\r\nplants and animals are being yearly exterminated, and this is the case even\r\nwith countries under the rule or protection of European governments. Such\r\nare the Sandwich Islands, Tahiti, the Marquesas, the Philippine Islands,\r\nand a host of smaller ones; while Bourbon and Mauritius, St. Helena, and\r\nseveral others, have only been adequately explored after an important\r\nportion of their productions has been destroyed by cultivation or the\r\nreckless introduction of goats and pigs. The employment in each of our\r\npossessions, and those of other European powers, of a resident naturalist\r\nat a very small annual expense, would have done more for the advancement of\r\nknowledge in this direction than all the expensive expeditions that have\r\nagain and again circumnavigated the globe.\r\n\r\n[3] The general facts of Palaeontology, as bearing on the migrations of\r\nanimal groups, are summarised in my _Geographical Distribution of Animals_,\r\nVol. I. Chapters VI., VII., and VIII.\r\n\r\n[4] Since these lines were written, a fine series of specimens of this rare\r\nhumming-bird has been obtained from the same locality. (See _Proc. Zool.\r\nSoc._ 1881, pp. 827-834.)\r\n\r\n[5] Many of these large genera are now subdivided, the divisions being\r\nsometimes termed genera, sometimes sub-genera.\r\n\r\n[6] The Palaearctic region includes temperate Asia and Europe, as will be\r\nexplained in the next chapter.\r\n\r\n[7] The following list of the genera of reptiles and amphibia peculiar to\r\nthe Palaearctic Region has been furnished me by Mr. G.

It is not, however,\r\nimprobable that it may be as great as in Europe. My friend A. C. Swinton,\r\nEsq., while working in the then almost unknown gold-field of Maryborough,\r\nVictoria, in January, 1855, found a fragment of a well-formed stone axe\r\nresting on the metamorphic schistose bed-rock about five feet beneath the\r\nsurface. It was overlain by the compact gravel drift called by the miners\r\n\"cement,\" and by an included layer of hard iron-stained sandstone. The\r\nfragment is about an inch and three-eighths wide and the same length, and\r\nis of very hard fine-grained black basalt. One side is ground to a very\r\nsmooth and regular surface, terminating in a well-formed cutting edge more\r\nthan an inch long, the return face of the cutting part being about a\r\nquarter of an inch wide. The other side is a broken surface. The weapon\r\nappears to have been an axe or tomahawk closely resembling that figured at\r\np. 335 of Lumholtz's _Among Cannibals_, from Central Queensland. The\r\nfragment was discovered by Mr. Swinton and the late Mr. Mackworth Shore,\r\none of the discoverers of the gold-field, before any rush to it had taken\r\nplace, and it seems impossible to avoid the conclusion that it was formed\r\nprior to the deposit of the gravel drift and iron-stained sandstone under\r\nwhich it lay. This would indicate a great antiquity of man in Australia,\r\nand would enable us to account for the fossilised remains of the dingo in\r\nPleistocene deposits as those of an animal introduced by man.\r\n\r\n[9] These facts are taken from a memoir on _The Mammals and Winter Birds of\r\nFlorida_, by J. A. Allen; forming Vol. II., No. 3, of the Bulletin of the\r\nMuseum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard College, Cambridge, Massachusetts.\r\n\r\n[10] The great variation in wild animals is more fully discussed and\r\nillustrated in the author's _Darwinism_ (Chapter III.).\r\n\r\n[11] See _Ibis_, 1879, p. 32.\r\n\r\n[12] In Mr. Seebohm's latest work, _Birds of the Japanese Empire_ (1890),\r\nhe says, \"Examples from North China are indistinguishable from those\r\nobtained in Greece\" (p. 82).\r\n\r\n[13] _Ibis_, 1879, p. 40. In his _Birds of the Japanese Empire_ (1890), Mr.\r\nSeebohm classes the Japanese and European forms as _E. schoeniclus_, and\r\nthinks that their range is probably continuous across the two continents.\r\n\r\n[14] Lyell's _Principles of Geology_, ii., p. 369.\r\n\r\n[15] Mr. Darwin found that the large _Helix pomatia_ lived after immersion\r\nin sea-water for twenty days. It is hardly likely that this is the extreme\r\nlimit of their powers of endurance, but even this would allow of their\r\nbeing floated many hundred miles at a stretch, and if we suppose the shell\r\nto be partially protected in the crevice of a log of wood, and to be thus\r\nout of water in calm weather, the distance might extend to a thousand miles\r\nor more. The eggs of fresh-water mollusca, as well as the young animals,\r\nare known to attach themselves to the feet of aquatic birds, and this is\r\nprobably the most efficient cause of their very wide diffusion.\r\n\r\n[16] _Principles of Geology_, 11th Ed., Vol. I., p. 258.\r\n\r\n[17] On Limestone as an Index of Geological Time.\r\n\r\n[18] In his _Preliminary Report on Oceanic Deposit_, Mr. Murray says:--\"It\r\nhas been found that the deposits taking place near continents and islands\r\nhave received their chief characteristics from the presence of the _debris_\r\nof adjacent lands. In some cases these deposits extend to a distance of\r\nover 150 miles from the coast.\" (_Proceedings of the Royal Society_, Vol.\r\nXXIV. p. 519.)\r\n\r\n\"The materials in suspension appear to be almost entirely deposited within\r\n200 miles of the land.\" (_Proceedings of the Royal Society of Edinburgh_,\r\n1876-77, p. 253.)\r\n\r\n[19] _Geographical Evolution. (Proceedings of the Royal Geographical\r\nSociety._ 1879, p. 426.)\r\n\r\n[20] Professor Dana was, I believe, the first to point out that the regions\r\nwhich, after long undergoing subsidence and accumulating vast piles of\r\nsedimentary deposit have been elevated into mountain ranges, thereby become\r\nstiff and unyielding, and that the next depression and subsequent upheaval\r\nwill be situated on one or the other sides of it; and he has shown that, in\r\nNorth America, this is the case with all the mountains of the successive\r\ngeological formations. Thus, depressions, and elevations of extreme\r\nslowness but often of vast amount, have occurred successively in restricted\r\nadjacent areas; and the effect has been to bring each portion in succession\r\nbeneath the ocean but always bordered on one or both sides by the remainder\r\nof the continent, from the denudation of which the deposits are formed\r\nwhich, on the subsequent upheaval, become mountain ranges.

It\r\nhas been examined microscopically and found to be destitute of the minute\r\norganisms abounding in the chalk of England. (_Geology of the United States\r\nExploring Expedition_, p. 150.) Mr. Guppy also found chalk-like coral\r\nlimestones containing 95 p.c. of carbonate of lime in the Solomon Islands.\r\n\r\nThe absence of _Globigerinae_ is a local phenomenon. They are quite absent\r\nin the Arafura Sea, and no _Globigerina_-ooze was found in any of the\r\nenclosed seas of the Pacific, but with these exceptions the _Globigerinae_\r\n\"are really found all over the bottom of the ocean.\" (Murray on Oceanic\r\nDeposits--_Proceedings of Royal Society_, Vol. XXIV., p. 523.)\r\n\r\nThe above analysis shows a far closer resemblance to chalk than that of the\r\n_Globigerina_-ooze of the Atlantic, four specimens of which given by Sir W.\r\nThomson (_Voyage of the Challenger_ Vol. II. Appendix, pp. 374-376, Nos. 9,\r\n10, 11 and 12) from the mid-Atlantic, show the following proportions:--\r\n\r\n  Carbonate of Lime          43.93   to  79.17 per cent.\r\n  Carbonate of Magnesia       1.40   to   2.58    ,,\r\n  Alumina and Oxide of Iron   6.00?  to  32.98    ,,\r\n  Silica                      4.60   to  11.23    ,,\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above there is a quantity of insoluble residue\r\nconsisting of small particles of sanidine, augite, hornblende, and\r\nmagnetite, supposed to be the product of volcanic dust or ashes carried\r\neither in the air or by ocean currents. This volcanic matter amounts to\r\nfrom 4.60 to 8.33 per cent. of the _Globigerina_-ooze of the mid-Atlantic,\r\nwhere it seems to be always present; and the small proportion of similar\r\nmatter in true chalk is another proof that its origin is different, and\r\nthat it was deposited far more rapidly than the oceanic ooze.\r\n\r\nThe following analysis of chalk by Mr. D. Forbes will show the difference\r\nbetween the two formations:--\r\n\r\n                                 Grey Chalk,    White Chalk,\r\n                                _Folkestone_.    _Shoreham_.\r\n\r\n  Carbonate of Lime                94.09           98.40\r\n  Carbonate of Magnesia             0.31            0.08\r\n  Alumina and Phosphoric Acid     a trace           0.42\r\n  Chloride of Sodium                1.29             --\r\n  Insoluble debris                  3.61            1.10\r\n\r\n(From _Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society_, Vol. XXVII.)\r\n\r\nThe large proportion of carbonate of lime, and the very small quantity of\r\nsilica, alumina, and insoluble _debris_, at once distinguish true chalk\r\nfrom the _Globigerina_-ooze of the deep ocean bed.\r\n\r\n[24] Notes on Reticularian Rhizopoda; in _Microscopical Journal_, Vol.\r\nXIX., New Series, p. 84.\r\n\r\n[25] _Proceedings of the Royal Society_, Vol. XXIV. p. 532.\r\n\r\n[26] See Presidential Address in Sect.

He\r\nsays:--\"The next long era, the Cretaceous, was more remarkable for slow\r\naccumulation of rock under the sea than for the formation of new land.\r\nDuring that time the Atlantic sent its waters across the whole of Europe\r\nand into Asia. But they were probably nowhere more than a few hundred feet\r\ndeep over the site of our continent, even at their deepest part. Upon their\r\nbottom there gathered a vast mass of calcareous mud, composed in great part\r\nof foraminifera, corals, echinoderms, and molluscs. Our English chalk,\r\nwhich ranges across the north of France, Belgium, Denmark, and the north of\r\nGermany, represents a portion of the deposits of that sea-floor.\" The\r\nweighty authority of the Director-General of the Geological Survey may\r\nperhaps cause some geologists to modify their views as to the deep-sea\r\norigin of chalk, who would have treated any arguments advanced by myself as\r\nnot worthy of consideration.\r\n\r\n[29] _Introduction and Succession of Vertebrate Life in America_, by\r\nProfessor O. C. Marsh. Reprinted from the _Popular Science Monthly_, March,\r\nApril, 1878.\r\n\r\n[30] _Physical Geography and Geology of Great Britain_, 5th Ed. p. 61.\r\n\r\n[31] Of late it has been the custom to quote the so-called \"ridge\" down the\r\ncentre of the Atlantic as indicating an extensive ancient land. Even\r\nProfessor Judd at one time adopted this view, speaking of the great belt of\r\nTertiary volcanoes \"which extended through Greenland, Iceland, the Faroe\r\nIslands, the Hebrides, Ireland, Central France, the Iberian Peninsula, the\r\nAzores, Madeira, Canaries, Cape de Verde Islands, Ascension, St. Helena,\r\nand Tristan d'Acunha, and which constituted as shown by the recent\r\nsoundings of H.M.S. _Challenger_ a mountain-range, comparable in its\r\nextent, elevation, and volcanic character with the Andes of South America\"\r\n(_Geological Mag._ 1874, p. 71). On examining the diagram of the Atlantic\r\nOcean in the _Challenger Reports_, No. 7, a considerable part of this ridge\r\nis found to be more than 1,900 fathoms deep, while the portion called the\r\n\"Connecting Ridge\" seems to be due in part to the deposits carried out by\r\nthe River Amazon. In the neighbourhood of the Azores, St. Paul's Rocks,\r\nAscension, and Tristan d'Acunha are considerable areas varying from 1,200\r\nto 1,500 fathoms deep, while the rest of the ridge is usually 1,800 or\r\n1,900 fathoms. The shallower water is no doubt due to volcanic upheaval and\r\nthe accumulation of volcanic ejections, and there may be many other deeply\r\nsubmerged old volcanoes on the ridge; but that it ever formed a chain of\r\nmountains \"comparable in elevation with the Andes,\" there seems not a\r\nparticle of evidence to prove. It is however probable that this ridge\r\nindicates the former existence of some considerable Atlantic islands, which\r\nmay serve to explain the presence of a few identical genera, and even\r\nspecies of plants and insects in Africa and South America, while the main\r\nbody of the fauna and flora of these two continents remains radically\r\ndistinct.\r\n\r\nIn my _Darwinism_ (pp. 344-5) I have given an additional argument founded\r\non the comparative height and area of land with the depth and area of\r\nocean, which seems to me to add considerably to the weight of the evidence\r\nhere submitted for the permanence of oceanic and continental areas.\r\n\r\n[32] In a review of Mr. T. Mellard Reade's _Chemical Denudation and\r\nGeological Time_, in _Nature_ (Oct. 2nd, 1879), the writer remarks as\r\nfollows:--\"One of the funny notions of some scientific thinkers meets with\r\nno favour from Mr. Reade, whose geological knowledge is practical as well\r\nas theoretical. They consider that because the older rocks contain nothing\r\nlike the present red clays, &c., of the ocean floor, that the oceans have\r\nalways been in their present positions. Mr. Reade points out that the first\r\nproposition is not yet proved, and the distribution of animals and plants\r\nand the fact that the bulk of the strata on land are of marine origin are\r\nopposed to the hypothesis.\" We must leave it to our readers to decide\r\nwhether the \"notion\" developed in this chapter is \"funny,\" or whether such\r\nhasty and superficial arguments as those here quoted from a \"practical\r\ngeologist\" have any value as against the different classes of facts, all\r\npointing to an opposite conclusion, which have now been briefly laid before\r\nthem, supported as they are by the expressed opinion of so weighty an\r\nauthority as Sir Archibald Geikie, who, in the lecture already quoted\r\nsays:--\"From all this evidence we may legitimately conclude that the\r\npresent land of the globe, though formed in great measure of marine\r\nformations, has never lain under the deep sea; but that its site must\r\nalways have been near land. Even its thick marine limestones are the\r\ndeposits of comparatively shallow water.\"\r\n\r\n[33] _Antiquity of Man_, 4th Ed. pp. 340-348.\r\n\r\n[34] _The Great Ice Age and its Relation to the Antiquity of Man._ By James\r\nGeikie, F.R.S. (Isbister and Co., 1874.)\r\n\r\n[35] This view of the formation of \"till\" is that adopted, by Dr. Geikie,\r\nand upheld by almost all the Scotch, Swiss, and Scandinavian geologists.\r\nThe objection however is made by many eminent English geologists, including\r\nthe late Mr. Searles V. Wood, Jun., that mud ground off the rocks cannot\r\nremain beneath the ice, forming sheets of great thickness, because the\r\nglacier cannot at the same time grind down solid rock and yet pass over the\r\nsurface of soft mud and loose stones. But this difficulty will disappear if\r\nwe consider the numerous fluctuations in the glacier with increasing size,\r\nand the additions it must have been constantly receiving as the ice from\r\none valley after another joined together, and at last produced an ice-sheet\r\ncovering the whole country. The grinding power is the motion and pressure\r\nof the ice, and the pressure will depend on its thickness. Now the points\r\nof maximum thickness must have often changed their positions, and the\r\nresult would be that the matter ground out in one place would be forced\r\ninto another place where the pressure was less. If there were no lateral\r\nescape for the mud, it would necessarily support the ice over it just as a\r\nwater-bed supports the person lying on it; and when there was little\r\ndrainage water, and the ice extended, say, twenty miles in every direction\r\nfrom a given part of a valley where the ice was of less than the average\r\nthickness, the mud would necessarily accumulate at this part simply because\r\nthere was no escape for it. Whenever the pressure all round any area was\r\ngreater than the pressure on that area, the _debris_ of the surrounding\r\nparts would be forced into it, and would even raise up the ice to give it\r\nroom. This is a necessary result of hydrostatic pressure. During this\r\nprocess the superfluous water would no doubt escape through fissures or\r\npores of the ice, and would leave the mud and stones in that excessively\r\ncompressed and tenacious condition in which the \"till\" is found. The\r\nunequal thickness and pressure of the ice above referred to would be a\r\nnecessary consequence of the inequalities in the valleys, now narrowing\r\ninto gorges, now opening out into wide plains, and again narrowed lower\r\ndown; and it is just in these openings in the valleys that the \"till\" is\r\nsaid to be found, and also in the lowlands where an ice-sheet must have\r\nextended for many miles in every direction. In these lowland valleys the\r\n\"till\" is both thickest and most wide-spread, and this is what we might\r\nexpect. At first, when the glaciers from the mountains pushed out into\r\nthese valleys, they would grind out the surface beneath them into hollows,\r\nand the drainage-water would carry away the _debris_. But when they spread\r\nall over the surface from sea to sea, and there was little or no drainage\r\nwater compared to the enormous area covered with ice, the great bulk of the\r\n_debris_ must have gathered under the ice wherever the pressure was least,\r\nand the ice would necessarily rise as it accumulated. Some of the mud would\r\nno doubt be forced out along lines of least resistance to the sea, but the\r\nfriction of the stone-charged \"till\" would be so enormous that it would be\r\nimpossible for any large part of it to be disposed of in this way.\r\n\r\n[36] That the ice-sheet was continuous from Scotland to Ireland is proved\r\nby the glacial phenomena in the Isle of Man, where \"till\" similar to that\r\nin Scotland abounds, and rocks are found in it which must have come from\r\nCumberland and Scotland, as well as from the north of Ireland. This would\r\nshow that glaciers from each of these districts reached the Isle of Man,\r\nwhere they met and flowed southwards down the Irish Sea. Ice-marks are\r\ntraced over the tops of the mountains which are nearly 2,000 feet high.\r\n(See _A Sketch of the Geology of the Isle of Man_, by John Horne, F.G.S.\r\n_Trans. of the Edin. Geol.

O. Fisher\r\ncalls attention to a result arrived at by Pouillet, that the temperature\r\nwhich the surface of the ground would assume if the sun were extinguished\r\nwould be -128deg F. instead of -239deg F. If this corrected amount were\r\nused in our calculations, the January temperature of England during the\r\nglacial epoch would come out 17deg F., and this Mr. Fisher thinks not low\r\nenough to cause any extreme difference from the present climate. In this\r\nopinion, however, I cannot agree with him. On the contrary, it would, I\r\nthink, be a relief to the theory were the amounts of decrease of\r\ntemperature in winter and increase in summer rendered more moderate, since\r\naccording to the usual calculation (which I have adopted) the differences\r\nare unnecessarily great. I cannot therefore think that this modification of\r\nthe temperatures, should it be ultimately proved to be correct (which is\r\naltogether denied by Dr. Croll), would be any serious objection to the\r\nadoption of Dr. Croll's theory of the Astronomical and Physical causes of\r\nthe Glacial Epoch.\r\n\r\nThe reason of the theoretical increase of summer heat being greater than\r\nthe decrease of winter cold is because we are now nearest the sun in winter\r\nand farthest in summer, whereas we calculate the temperatures of the\r\nglacial epoch for the phase of precession when the _aphelion_ was in\r\nwinter. A large part of the increase of temperature would no doubt be used\r\nup in melting ice and evaporating water, so that there would be a much less\r\nincrease of sensible heat; while only a portion of the theoretical lowering\r\nof temperature in winter would be actually produced owing to equalising\r\neffect of winds and currents, and the storing up of heat by the earth and\r\nocean.\r\n\r\n[46] Dr. Croll says this \"is one of the most widespread and fundamental\r\nerrors within the whole range of geological climatology.\" The temperature\r\nof the snow itself is, he says, one of the main factors. (_Climate and\r\nCosmology_, p. 85.) But surely the temperature of the snow must depend on\r\nthe temperature of the air through which it falls.\r\n\r\n[47] In an account of Prof. Nordenskjoeld's recent expedition round the\r\nnorthern coast of Asia, given in _Nature_, November 20th, 1879, we have the\r\nfollowing passage, fully supporting the statement in the text. \"Along the\r\nwhole coast, from the White Sea to Behring's Straits, no glacier was seen.\r\nDuring autumn the Siberian coast is nearly free of ice and snow. There are\r\nno mountains covered all the year round with snow, although some of them\r\nrise to a height of more than 2,000 feet.\" It must be remembered that the\r\nnorth coast of Eastern Siberia is in the area of supposed greatest winter\r\ncold on the globe.\r\n\r\n[48] Dr. Croll objects to this argument on the ground that Greenland and\r\nthe Antarctic continent are probably lowlands or groups of islands.\r\n(_Climate and Cosmology_, Chap. V.)\r\n\r\n[49] \"On the Glacial Epoch,\" by James Croll. _Geol. Mag._ July, August,\r\n1874.\r\n\r\n[50] \"The general absence of recent marks of glacial action in Eastern\r\nEurope is well known; and the series of changes which have been so well\r\ntraced and described by Prof. Szabo as occurring in those districts seems\r\nto leave no room for those periodical extensions of 'ice-caps' with which\r\nsome authors in this country have amused themselves and their readers. Mr.\r\nCampbell, whose ability to recognise the physical evidence of glaciers will\r\nscarcely be questioned, finds quite the same absence of the proof of\r\nextensive ice-action in North America, westward of the meridian of\r\nChicago.\" (Prof. J. W. Judd in _Geol. Mag._ 1876, p. 535.)\r\n\r\nThe same author notes the diminution of marks of ice-action on going\r\neastward in the Alps; and the Altai Mountains far in Central Asia show no\r\nsigns of having been largely glaciated. West of the Rocky Mountains,\r\nhowever, in the Sierra Nevada and the coast ranges further north, signs of\r\nextensive old glaciers again appear; all which phenomena are strikingly in\r\naccordance with the theory here advocated, of the absolute dependence of\r\nglaciation on abundant rainfall and elevated snow-condensers and\r\naccumulators.\r\n\r\n[51] I have somewhat modified this whole passage in the endeavour to\r\nrepresent more accurately the difference between the views of Dr. Croll and\r\nSir Charles Lyell.\r\n\r\n[52] For numerous details and illustrations see the paper--\"On Ocean\r\nCurrents in Relation to the Physical Theory of Secular Changes of\r\nClimate\"--in the _Philosophical Magazine_, 1870.\r\n\r\n[53] See _Darwin's Naturalist's Voyage Round the World_, 2nd Edition, pp.\r\n244-251.\r\n\r\n[54] The influence of geographical changes on climate is now held by many\r\ngeologists who oppose what they consider the extravagant hypotheses of Dr.\r\nCroll. Thus, Prof. Dana imputes the glacial epoch chiefly, if not wholly,\r\nto elevation of the land caused by the lateral pressure due to shrinking of\r\nthe earth's crust that has caused all other elevations and depressions. He\r\nsays: \"Now, that elevation of the land over the higher latitudes which\r\nbrought on the glacial era is a natural result of the same agency, and a\r\nnatural, and almost necessary, counterpart of the coral-island subsidence\r\nwhich must have been then in progress. The accumulating, folding,\r\nsolidification, and crystallisation of rocks attending all the rock-making\r\nand mountain-making through the Palaeozoic, Mesozoic, and Cenozoic eras,\r\nhad greatly stiffened the crust in these parts; and hence in after times,\r\nthe continental movements resulting from the lateral pressure necessarily\r\nappeared over the more northern portions of the continent, where the\r\naccumulations and other changes had been relatively small. To the\r\nsubsidence which followed the elevation the weight of the ice-cap may have\r\ncontributed in some small degree. But the great balancing movements of the\r\ncrust of the continental and oceanic areas then going forward must have had\r\na greatly preponderating effect in the oscillating agency of all\r\ntime--lateral pressure within the crust.\" (_American Journal of Science and\r\nArts_, 3rd Series, Vol. IX. p. 318.)\r\n\r\n\"In the 2nd edition of his _Manual of Geology_, Professor Dana suggests\r\nelevation of Arctic lands sufficient to exclude the Gulf Stream, as a\r\nsource of cold during glacial epochs. This, he thinks, would have made an\r\nepoch of cold at any era of the globe. A deep submergence of Behring's\r\nStrait, letting in the Pacific warm current to the polar area, would have\r\nproduced a mild Arctic climate like that of the Miocene period. When the\r\nwarm current was shut out from the polar area it would yet reach near to\r\nit, and bring with it that abundant moisture necessary for glaciation.\"\r\n(_Manual of Geology_, 2nd Edition, pp. 541-755, 756.)\r\n\r\n[55] Dana's _Manual of Geology_, 2nd Edition, p. 540.\r\n\r\n[56] Dr. Croll says that I here assume an impossible state of things. He\r\nmaintains \"that the change from the distant sun in winter, and near sun in\r\nsummer to the near sun in winter and distant sun in summer, aided by the\r\nchange in the physical causes which this would necessarily bring about,\r\nwould certainly be sufficient to cause the snow and ice to disappear.\"\r\n(_Climate and Cosmology_, p. 106.) But I demur to his \"necessarily.\" It is\r\nnot the _direct_ effect of the nearer sun in winter that is supposed to\r\nmelt the snow and ice, but the \"physical causes,\" such as absence of fogs\r\nand increase of warm equatorial currents. But the near sun in winter acting\r\non an ice-clad surface would only increase the fogs and snow, while the\r\ncurrents could only change if a large portion of the ice were first melted,\r\nin which case they would no doubt be modified so as to cause a further\r\nmelting of the ice. Dr. Croll says: \"The warm and equable conditions of\r\nclimate which would then prevail, and the enormous quantity of\r\nintertropical water carried into the Southern Ocean, would soon produce a\r\nmelting of the ice.\" (_Loc. cit._ p. 111.) This seems to me to be assuming\r\nthe very point at issue. He has himself shown that the presence of large\r\nquantities of ice prevents \"a warm and equable climate\" however great may\r\nbe the sun-heat; the ice therefore would _not_ be melted, and there would\r\nbe no increased flow of intertropical water to the Southern Ocean. The\r\nocean currents are mainly due to the difference of temperature of the polar\r\nand equatorial areas combined with the peculiar form and position of the\r\ncontinents, and some one or more of these factors must be altered _before_\r\nthe ocean currents towards the north pole can be increased. The only factor\r\navailable is the Antarctic ice, and if this were largely increased, the\r\nnorthward-flowing currents might be so increased as to melt some of the\r\nArctic ice. But the very same argument applies to both poles. Without some\r\ngeographical change the Antarctic ice could not materially diminish during\r\nits winter in _perihelion_, nor increase to any important extent during the\r\nopposite phase. We therefore seem to have no available agency by which to\r\nget rid of the ice over a glaciated hemisphere, _so long as the\r\ngeographical conditions remained unchanged and the excentricity continued\r\nhigh_.\r\n\r\n[57] In the _Geological Magazine_, April, 1880, Mr. Searles V. Wood adduces\r\nwhat he considers to be the \"conclusive objection\" to Dr. Croll's\r\nexcentricity theory, which is, that during the last glacial epoch Europe\r\nand North America were glaciated very much in proportion to their\r\nrespective climates now, which are generally admitted to be due to the\r\ndistribution of oceanic currents. But Dr. Croll admits his theory \"to be\r\nbaseless unless there was a complete diversion of the warm ocean currents\r\nfrom the hemisphere glaciated,\" in which case there ought to be no\r\ndifference in the extent of glaciation in Europe and North America. Whether\r\nor not this is a correct statement of Dr. Croll's theory, the above\r\nobjection certainly does not apply to the views here advocated; but as I\r\nalso hold the \"excentricity theory\" in a modified form, it may be as well\r\nto show why it does not apply. In the first place I do not believe that the\r\nGulf Stream was \"completely diverted\" during the glacial epoch, but that it\r\nwas diminished in force, and (as described at p. 144) _partly_ diverted\r\nsouthward. A portion of its influence would, however, still remain to cause\r\na difference between the climates of the two sides of the Atlantic; and to\r\nthis must be added two other causes--the far greater penetration of warm\r\nsea-water into the European than into the North American continent, and the\r\nproximity to America of the enormous ice-producing mass of Greenland. We\r\nhave thus three distinct causes, all combining to produce a more severe\r\nwinter climate on the west than on the east of the Atlantic during the\r\nglacial epoch, and though the first of these--the Gulf Stream--was not\r\nnearly so powerful as it is now, neither is the difference indicated by the\r\nice-extension in the two countries so great as the present difference of\r\nwinter-temperature, which is the essential point to be considered. The\r\nice-sheet of the United States is usually supposed to have extended about\r\nten, or, at most, twelve, degrees further south than it did in Western\r\nEurope, whereas we must go twenty degrees further south in the former\r\ncountry to obtain the same mean winter-temperature we find in the latter,\r\nas may be seen by examining any map of winter isothermals. This difference\r\nvery fairly corresponds to the difference of conditions existing during the\r\nglacial epoch and the present time, so far as we are able to estimate them,\r\nand it certainly affords no grounds of objection to the theory by which the\r\nglaciation is here explained.\r\n\r\n[58] Dr. Croll objects to this argument, and adduces the case of Greenland\r\nas showing that ice may accumulate far from sea. But the width of Greenland\r\nis small compared with that of the supposed Antarctic ice-cap. (_Climate\r\nand Cosmology_, p. 78.)\r\n\r\n[59] The recent extensive glaciation of New Zealand is generally imputed by\r\nthe local geologists to a greater elevation of the land; but I cannot help\r\nbelieving that the high phase of excentricity which caused our own glacial\r\nepoch was at all events an assisting cause. This is rendered more probable\r\nif taken in connection with the following very definite statement of\r\nglacial markings in South Africa. Captain Aylward in his _Transvaal of\r\nTo-day_ (p. 171) says:--\"It will be interesting to geologists and others to\r\nlearn that the entire country, from the summits of the Quathlamba to the\r\njunction of the Vaal and Orange rivers, shows marks of having been swept\r\nover, and that at no very distant period, by vast masses of ice from east\r\nto west. The striations are plainly visible, scarring the older rocks, and\r\nmarking the hill-sides--getting lower and lower and less visible as,\r\ndescending from the mountains, the kopjies (small hills) stand wider apart;\r\nbut wherever the hills narrow towards each other, again showing how the\r\nvast ice-fields were checked, thrown up, and raised against their Eastern\r\nextremities.\"\r\n\r\nThis passage is evidently written by a person familiar with the phenomena\r\nof glaciation, and as Captain Aylward's preface is dated from Edinburgh, he\r\nhas probably seen similar markings in Scotland. The country described\r\nconsists of the most extensive and lofty plateau in South Africa, rising to\r\na mountain knot with peaks more than 10,000 feet high, thus offering an\r\nappropriate area for the condensation of vapour and the accumulation of\r\nsnow. At present, however, the mountains do not reach the snow-line, and\r\nthere is no proof that they have been much higher in recent times, since\r\nthe coast of Natal is now said to be rising. It is evident that no slight\r\nelevation would now lead to the accumulation of snow and ice in these\r\nmountains, situated as they are between 27deg and 30deg S. Lat.; since the\r\nAndes, which in 32deg S. Lat. reach 23,300 feet high, and in 28deg S. Lat.\r\n20,000, with far more extensive plateaus, produce no ice-fields. We cannot,\r\ntherefore, believe that a few thousand feet of additional elevation, even\r\nif it occurred so recently as indicated by the presence of striations,\r\nwould have produced the remarkable amount of glaciation above described;\r\nwhile from the analogy of the northern hemisphere, we may well believe that\r\nit was mainly due to the same high excentricity that led to the glaciation\r\nof Western and Central Europe, and Eastern North America.\r\n\r\nThese observations confirm those of Mr. G. W. Stow, who, in a paper\r\npublished in the _Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society_ (Vol. XXVII.\r\np. 539), describes similar phenomena in the same mountains, and also mounds\r\nand ridges of unstratified clay packed with angular boulders; while further\r\nsouth the Stormberg mountains are said to be similarly glaciated, with\r\nimmense accumulations of morainic matter in all the valleys. We have here\r\nmost of the surface phenomena characteristic of a glaciated country, only a\r\nfew degrees south of the tropic; and taken in connection with the\r\nindications of recent glaciation in New Zealand, and those discovered by\r\nDr. R. von Lendenfeld in the Australian Alps between 6,000 and 7,000 feet\r\nelevation (_Nature_, Vol. XXXII. p. 69), we can hardly doubt the occurrence\r\nof some general and wide-spread cause of glaciation in the southern\r\nhemisphere at a period so recent that the superficial phenomena are almost\r\nas well preserved as in Europe. Other geologists however deny that there\r\nare any distinct indications of glacial action in South Africa; but the\r\nrecent discovery by Dr. J. W. Gregory, F.G.S., of the former extension of\r\nglaciers on Mount Kenya 5,000 feet below their present limits, renders\r\nprobable the former glaciation of the South African Highlands.\r\n\r\n[60] The astronomical facts connected with the motions and appearance of\r\nthe planet are taken from a paper by Mr. Edward Carpenter, M.A., in the\r\n_Geological Magazine_ of March, 1877, entitled, \"Evidence Afforded by Mars\r\non the Subject of Glacial Periods,\" but I arrive at somewhat different\r\nconclusions from those of the writer of the paper.\r\n\r\n[61] In an article in _Nature_ of Jan. 1, 1880, the Rev. T. W. Webb states\r\nthat in 1877 the pole of Mars (? the south pole) was, according to\r\nSchiaparelli, entirely free of snow. He remarks also on the regular contour\r\nof the supposed snows of Mars as offering a great contrast to ours, and\r\nalso the strongly marked dark border which has often been observed. On the\r\nwhole Mr. Webb seems to be of opinion that there can be no really close\r\nresemblance between the physical condition of the Earth and Mars, and that\r\nany arguments founded on such supposed similarity are therefore\r\nuntrustworthy.\r\n\r\n[62] _London, Edinburgh and Dublin Philosophical Magazine_, Vol. XXXVI.,\r\npp. 144-150 (1868).\r\n\r\n[63] _Climate and Time in their Geological Relations_, p. 341.\r\n\r\n[64] _Nature_, Vol. XXI., p. 345, \"The Interior of Greenland.\"\r\n\r\n[65] Prof. J. W. Judd says: \"In the case of the Alps I know of no glacial\r\nphenomena which are not capable of being explained, like those of New\r\nZealand, by a great extension of the area of the tracts above the snow-line\r\nwhich would collect more ample supplies for the glaciers protruded into\r\nsurrounding plains. And when we survey the grand panoramas of ridges,\r\npinnacles, and peaks produced for the most part by sub-aerial action, we\r\nmay well be prepared to admit that before the intervening ravines and\r\nvalleys were excavated, the glaciers shed from the elevated plateaux must\r\nhave been of vastly greater magnitude than at present.\" (Contributions to\r\nthe Study of Volcanoes, _Geological Magazine_, 1876, p. 536.) Professor\r\nJudd applies these remarks to the last as well as to previous glacial\r\nperiods in the Alps; but surely there has been no such extensive alteration\r\nand lowering of the surface of the country since the erratic blocks were\r\ndeposited on the Jura and the great moraines formed in North Italy, as this\r\ntheory would imply. We can hardly suppose wide areas to have been lowered\r\nthousands of feet by denudation, and yet have left other adjacent areas\r\napparently untouched; and it is even very doubtful whether such an\r\nextension of the snow-fields would alone suffice for the effects which were\r\ncertainly produced.\r\n\r\n[66] _Geological Magazine_, 1876, p. 392.\r\n\r\n[67] Colonel Fielden thinks that these trees have all been brought down by\r\nrivers, and have been stranded on shores which have been recently elevated.\r\nSee _Trans. of Norfolk Nat. Hist. Soc., Vol. III._, 1880.\r\n\r\n[68] _Geological Magazine_, 1876, \"Geology of Spitzbergen,\" p. 267.\r\n\r\n[69] The preceding account is mostly derived from Professor Heer's great\r\nwork _Flora Fossilis Arctica_.\r\n\r\n[70] _Geological Magazine_, 1875, p. 531.\r\n\r\n[71] _Geological Magazine_, 1876, p. 266. In his recent work--_Climate and\r\nCosmology_ (pp. 164, 172)--the late Dr. Croll has appealed to the\r\nimperfection of the geological record as a reply to these arguments; in\r\nthis case, as it appears to me, a very unsuccessful one.\r\n\r\n[72] It is interesting to observe that the Cretaceous flora of the United\r\nStates (that of the Dakota group), indicates a somewhat cooler climate than\r\nthat of the following Eocene period. Mr. De Rance (in the geological\r\nappendix to Capt. Sir G. Nares's _Narrative of a Voyage to the Polar Sea_)\r\nremarks as follows: \"In the overlying American Eocenes occur types of\r\nplants occurring in the European Miocenes and still living, proving the\r\ntruth of Professor Lesquereux's postulate, that the plant types appear in\r\nAmerica a stage in advance of their advent in Europe. These plants point to\r\na far higher mean temperature than those of the Dakota group, to a dense\r\natmosphere of vapour, and a luxuriance of ferns and palms.\" This is very\r\nimportant as adding further proof to the view that the climates of former\r\nperiods are not due to any general refrigeration, but to causes which were\r\nsubject to change and alternation in former ages as now.\r\n\r\n[73] Mr. S. B. J. Skertchley informs me that he has himself observed thick\r\nTertiary deposits, consisting of clays and anhydrous gypsum, at Berenice on\r\nthe borders of Egypt and Nubia, at a height of about 600 feet above the\r\nsea-level; but these may have been of fresh-water origin.\r\n\r\n[74] By referring to our map of the Indian Ocean showing the submarine\r\nbanks indicating ancient islands (Chap. XIX.), it will be evident that the\r\nsouth-east trade-winds--then exceptionally powerful--would cause a vast\r\nbody of water to enter the deep Arabian Sea.\r\n\r\n[75] In his recently published _Lectures on Physical Geography_, Professor\r\nHaughton calculates, that more than half the solar heat of the torrid zone\r\nis carried to the temperate zones by ocean currents. The Gulf Stream itself\r\ncarries one-twelfth of the total amount, but it is probable that a very\r\nsmall fraction of this quantity of heat reaches the polar seas owing to the\r\nwide area over which the current spreads in the North Atlantic. The\r\ncorresponding stream of the Indian Ocean in Miocene times would have been\r\nfully equal to the Gulf Stream in heating power, while, owing to its being\r\nso much more concentrated, a large proportion of its heat may have reached\r\nthe polar area. But the Arctic Ocean occupies less than one-tenth of the\r\narea of the tropical seas; so that, whatever proportion of the heat of the\r\ntropical zone was conveyed to it, would, by being concentrated into\r\none-tenth of the surface, produce an enormously increased effect. Taking\r\nthis into consideration, we can hardly doubt that the opening of a\r\nsufficient passage from the Indian Ocean to the Arctic seas would produce\r\nthe effects above indicated.\r\n\r\n[76] For an account of the resemblances and differences of the mammalia of\r\nthe two continents during the Tertiary epoch, see my _Geographical\r\nDistribution of Animals_, Vol. I. pp. 140-156.\r\n\r\n[77] Professor Haughton has made an elaborate calculation of the difference\r\nbetween existing climates and those of Miocene times, for all the places\r\nwhere a Miocene flora has been discovered, by means of the actual range of\r\ncorresponding species and genera of plants. Although this method is open to\r\nthe objection that the ranges of plants and animals are not determined by\r\ntemperature only, yet the results may be approximately correct, and are\r\nvery interesting. The following table which summarizes these results is\r\ntaken from his Lectures on Physical Geography (p. 344):--\r\n\r\n  _______________________________________________________________________\r\n  |                     |         |  Present   |  Miocene   |           |\r\n  |                     |Latitude.|Temperature.|Temperature.|Difference.|\r\n  |_____________________|_________|____________|____________|___________|\r\n  | 1.

This, as well as, the greater increase of temperature as we go\r\nnorthward and the polar area becomes more limited, is quite in accordance\r\nwith the view of the causes which brought about the Miocene climate which\r\nis here advocated.\r\n\r\n[78] The objection has been made, that the long polar night would of itself\r\nbe fatal to the existence of such a luxuriant vegetation as we know to have\r\nexisted as far as 80deg N. Lat., and that there must have been some\r\nalteration of the position of the pole, or diminution of the obliquity of\r\nthe ecliptic, to permit such plants as magnolias and large-leaved maples to\r\nflourish. But there appears to be really no valid grounds for such an\r\nobjection. Not only are numbers of Alpine and Arctic evergreens deeply\r\nburied in the snow for many months without injury, but a variety of\r\ntropical and sub-tropical plants are preserved in the hot-houses of St.\r\nPetersburg and other northern cities, which are closely matted during\r\nwinter, and are thus exposed to as much darkness as the night of the Arctic\r\nregions. We have besides no proof that any of the Arctic trees or large\r\nshrubs were evergreens, and the darkness would certainly not be prejudical\r\nto deciduous plants. With a suitable temperature there is nothing to\r\nprevent a luxuriant vegetation up to the pole, and the long continued day\r\nis known to be highly favourable to the development of foliage, which in\r\nthe same species is larger and better developed in Norway than in the south\r\nof England.\r\n\r\n[79] _Geological Magazine_, 1873, p. 320.\r\n\r\n[80] _Geological Magazine_, 1877, p. 137.\r\n\r\n[81] _Manual of Geology_, 2nd Ed. p. 525.

(Croll on the \"Probable Origin and Age of the\r\nSun.\")\r\n\r\n[85] _Philosophical Magazine_, April, 1853.\r\n\r\n[86] It has usually been the practice to take the amount of denudation in\r\nthe Mississippi valley, or one foot in six thousand years, as a measure of\r\nthe rate of denudation in Europe, from an idea apparently of being on the\r\n\"safe side,\" and of not over-estimating the rate of change. But this\r\nappears to me a most unphilosophical mode of proceeding and unworthy of\r\nscientific inquiry. What should we think of astronomers if they always took\r\nthe lowest estimates of planetary or stellar distances, instead of the mean\r\nresults of observation, \"in order to be on the safe side!\"? As if error in\r\none direction were any worse than error in another. Yet this is what\r\ngeologists do systematically. Whenever any calculations are made involving\r\nthe antiquity of man, it is those that give the _lowest_ results that are\r\nalways taken, for no reason apparently except that there was, for so long a\r\ntime, a prejudice, both popular and scientific, against the great antiquity\r\nof man; and now that a means has been found of measuring the rate of\r\ndenudation, they take the slowest rate instead of the mean rate, apparently\r\nonly because there is now a scientific prejudice in favour of extremely\r\nslow geological change. I take the mean of the whole; and as this is almost\r\nexactly the same as the mean of the three great European rivers--the Rhone,\r\nDanube, and Po--I cannot believe that this will not be nearer the truth for\r\nEurope than taking one North American river as the standard.\r\n\r\n[87] \"On the Height of the Land and the Depth of the Ocean,\" in the\r\n_Scottish Geographical Magazine_, 1888.\r\n\r\n[88] These figures are merely used to give an idea of the rate at which\r\ndenudation is actually going on now; but if no elevatory forces were at\r\nwork, the rate of denudation would certainly diminish as the mountains were\r\nlowered and the slope of the ground everywhere rendered flatter. This would\r\nfollow not only from the diminished power of rain and rivers, but because\r\nthe climate would become more uniform, the rainfall probably less, and no\r\nrocky peaks would be left to be fractured and broken up by the action of\r\nfrosts. It is certain, however, that no continent has ever remained long\r\nsubject to the influences of denudation alone, for, as we have seen in our\r\nsixth chapter, elevation and depression have always been going on in one\r\npart or other of the surface.\r\n\r\n[89] The following statement of the depths at which the Palaeozoic\r\nformations have been reached in various localities in and round London was\r\ngiven by Mr. H. B. Woodward in his address to the Norwich Geological\r\nSociety in 1879:--\r\n\r\n  _Deep Wells through the Tertiary and Cretaceous Formations._\r\n\r\n  Harwich              at 1,022 feet reached Carboniferous Rock.\r\n  Kentish Town         ,, 1,114  ,,    ,,    Old Red Sandstone.\r\n  Tottenham Court Road ,, 1,064  ,,    ,,    Devonian.\r\n  Blackwall            ,, 1,004  ,,    ,,    Devonian or Old Red Sandstone.\r\n  Ware                 ,,   800  ,,    ,,    Silurian (Wenlock Shale).\r\n\r\nWe thus find that over a wide area, extending from London to Ware and\r\nHarwich, the whole of the formations from the Oolite to the Permian are\r\nwanting, the Cretaceous resting on the Carboniferous or older Palaeozoic\r\nrocks; and the same deficiency extends across to Belgium, where the\r\nTertiary beds are found resting on Carboniferous at a depth of less than\r\n400 feet.\r\n\r\n[90] _Geological Magazine_, Vol. VIII., March, 1871.\r\n\r\n[91] Mr. C. Lloyd Morgan has well illustrated this point by comparing the\r\ngenerally tilted-up strata denuded on their edges, to a library in which a\r\nfire had acted on the exposed edges of the books, destroying a great mass\r\nof literature but leaving a portion of each book in its place, which\r\nportion represents the thickness but not the size of the book. (_Geological\r\nMagazine_, 1878, p. 161.)\r\n\r\n[92] Professor J. Young thinks it highly probable that--\"the Lower\r\nGreensand is contemporaneous with part of the Chalk, so were parts of the\r\nWealden; nay, even of the Purbeck a portion must have been forming while\r\nthe Cretaceous sea was gradually deepening southward and westward.\" Yet\r\nthese deposits are always arranged successively, and their several\r\nthicknesses added together to obtain the total thickness of the formations\r\nof the country. (See Presidential Address, Sect. C. British Association,\r\n1876.)\r\n\r\n[93] Mr. John Murray in his more careful estimate makes it about 51-1/2\r\nmillions.\r\n\r\n[94] As by far the larger portion of the denuded matter of the globe passes\r\nto the sea through comparatively few great rivers, the deposits must often\r\nbe confined to very limited areas. Thus the denudation of the vast\r\nMississippi basin must be almost all deposited in a limited portion of the\r\nGulf of Mexico, that of the Nile within a small area of the Eastern\r\nMediterranean, and that of the great rivers of China--the Hoang Ho and\r\nYang-tse-kiang, in a small portion of the Eastern Sea. Enormous lengths of\r\ncoast, like those of Western America and Eastern Africa, receive very\r\nscanty deposits; so that thirty miles in width along the whole of the\r\ncoasts of the globe will probably give an area greater than that of the\r\narea of _average_ deposit, and certainly greater than that of _maximum_\r\ndeposit, which is the basis on which I have here made my estimates. In the\r\ncase of the Mississippi, it is stated by Count Pourtales that along the\r\nplateau between the mouth of the river and the southern extremity of\r\nFlorida for two hundred and fifty miles in width the bottom consists of\r\nclay with some sand and but few Rhizopods; but beyond this distance the\r\nsoundings brought up either Rhizopod shells alone, or these mixed with\r\ncoral sand, Nullipores, and other calcareous organisms (Dana's _Manual of\r\nGeology_, 2nd Ed. p. 671). It is probable, therefore, that a large\r\nproportion of the entire mass of sediment brought down by the Mississippi\r\nis deposited on the limited area above indicated.\r\n\r\nProfessor Dana further remarks: \"Over interior oceanic basins as well as\r\noff a coast in quiet depths, fifteen or twenty fathoms and beyond, the\r\ndeposits are mostly of fine silt, fitted for making fine argillaceous\r\nrocks, as shales or slates. When, however, the depth of the ocean falls off\r\nbelow a hundred fathoms, the deposition of silt in our existing oceans\r\nmostly ceases, unless in the case of a great bank along the border of a\r\ncontinent.\"\r\n\r\n[95] From the same data Professor Haughton estimates a minimum of 200\r\nmillion years for the duration of geological time; but he arrives at this\r\nconclusion by supposing the products of denudation to be uniformly spread\r\nover the _whole sea-bottom_ instead of over a narrow belt near the coasts,\r\na supposition entirely opposed to all the known facts, and which had been\r\nshown by Dr. Croll, five years previously, to be altogether erroneous. (See\r\n_Nature_, Vol. XVIII., p. 268, where Professor Haughton's paper is given as\r\nread before the Royal Society.)\r\n\r\n[96] See _Geological Magazine_ for 1877, p. 1.\r\n\r\n[97] In his reply to Sir W. Thomson, Professor Huxley _assumed_ one foot in\r\na thousand years as a not improbable rate of deposition. The above estimate\r\nindicates a far higher rate; and this follows from the well-ascertained\r\nfact, that the area of deposition is many times smaller than the area of\r\ndenudation.\r\n\r\n[98] Dr. Croll and Sir Archibald Geikie have shown that marine denudation\r\nis very small in amount as compared with sub-aerial, since it acts only\r\nlocally on the _edge_ of the land, whereas the latter acts over every foot\r\nof the _surface_. Mr. W. T. Blanford argues that the difference is still\r\ngreater in tropical than in temperate latitudes, and arrives at the\r\nconclusion that--\"If over British India the effects of marine to those of\r\nfresh-water denudation in removing the rocks of the country be estimated at\r\n1 to 100, I believe that the result of marine action will be greatly\r\noverstated\" (_Geology and Zoology of Abyssinia_, p. 158, note). Now, as our\r\nestimate of the rate of sub-aerial denudation cannot pretend to any precise\r\naccuracy, we are justified in neglecting marine denudation altogether,\r\nespecially as we have no method of estimating it for the whole earth with\r\nany approach to correctness.\r\n\r\n[99] Agassiz appears to have been the first to suggest that the principal\r\nepochs of life extermination were epochs of cold; and Dana thinks that two\r\nat least such epochs may be recognised, at the close of the Palaeozoic and\r\nof the Cretaceous periods--to which we may add the last glacial epoch.\r\n\r\n[100] This view was, I believe, first put forth by myself in a paper read\r\nbefore the Geological Section of the British Association in 1869, and\r\nsubsequently in an article in _Nature_, Vol. I. p. 454. It was also stated\r\nby Mr. S. B. J. Skertchley in his _Physical System of the Universe_, p. 363\r\n(1878); but we both founded it on what I now consider the erroneous\r\ndoctrine that actual glacial epochs recurred each 10,500 years during\r\nperiods of high excentricity.\r\n\r\n[101] Explication d'une seconde edition de la _Carte Geologique de la\r\nTerre_ (1875), p. 64.\r\n\r\n[102] For most of the facts as to the zoology and botany of these islands,\r\nI am indebted to Mr. Godman's valuable work--_Natural History of the Azores\r\nor Western Islands_, by Frederick Du Cane Godman, F.L.S., F.Z.S., &c.,\r\nLondon, 1870.\r\n\r\n[103] See Chap. V. p. 78.\r\n\r\n[104] Some of Mr. Darwin's experiments are very interesting and suggestive.\r\nRipe hazel-nuts sank immediately, but when dried they floated for ninety\r\ndays, and afterwards germinated. An asparagus-plant with ripe berries, when\r\ndried, floated for eighty-five days, and the seeds afterwards germinated.\r\nOut of ninety-four dried plants experimented with, eighteen floated for\r\nmore than a month, and some for three months, and their powers of\r\ngermination seem never to have been wholly destroyed. Now, as oceanic\r\ncurrents vary from thirty to sixty miles a day, such plants under the most\r\nfavourable conditions might be carried 90 X 60 = 5,400 miles! But even half\r\nof this is ample to enable them to reach any oceanic island, and we must\r\nremember that till completely water-logged they might be driven along at a\r\nmuch greater rate by the wind. Mr. Darwin calculates the distance by the\r\naverage time of flotation to be 924 miles; but in such a case as this we\r\nare entitled to take the extreme cases, because such countless thousands of\r\nplants and seeds must be carried out to sea annually that the extreme cases\r\nin a single experiment with only ninety-four plants, must happen hundreds\r\nor thousands of times and with hundreds or thousands of species, naturally,\r\nand thus afford ample opportunities for successful migration. (See _Origin\r\nof Species_, 6th Edition, p. 325.)\r\n\r\n[105] The following remarks, kindly communicated to me by Mr. H. N.\r\nMoseley, naturalist to the _Challenger_, throw much light on the agency of\r\nbirds in the distribution of plants:--\"Grisebach (_Veg. der Erde_, Vol. II.\r\np. 496) lays much stress on the wide ranging of the albatross (Diomedea)\r\nacross the equator from Cape Horn to the Kurile Islands, and thinks that\r\nthe presence of the same plants in Arctic and Antarctic regions may be\r\naccounted for, possibly, by this fact. I was much struck at Marion Island\r\nof the Prince Edward group, by observing that the great albatross breeds in\r\nthe midst of a dense, low herbage, and constructs its nest of a mound of\r\nturf and herbage. Some of the indigenous plants, _e.g._ Acaena, have\r\nflower-heads which stick like burrs to feathers, &c., and seem specially\r\nadapted for transposition by birds. Besides the albatrosses, various\r\nspecies of Procellaria and Puffinus, birds which range over immense\r\ndistances may, I think, have played a great part in the distribution of\r\nplants, and especially account, in some measure, for the otherwise\r\ndifficult fact (when occurring in the tropics), that widely distant islands\r\nhave similar mountain plants. The Procellaria and Puffinus in nesting,\r\nburrow in the ground, as far as I have seen choosing often places where the\r\nvegetation is the thickest. The birds in burrowing get their feathers\r\ncovered with vegetable mould, which must include spores, and often seeds.\r\nIn high latitudes the birds often burrow near the sea-level, as at Tristan\r\nd'Acunha or Kerguelen's Land, but in the tropics they choose the mountains\r\nfor their nesting-place (Finsch and Hartlaub, _Orn. der Viti- und\r\nTonga-Inseln_, 1867, Einleitung, p. xviii.). Thus, _Puffinus megasi_ nests\r\nat the top of the Korobasa basaga mountain, Viti Levu, fifty miles from the\r\nsea. A Procellaria breeds in like manner in the high mountains of Jamaica,\r\nI believe at 7,000 feet. Peale describes the same habit of _Procellaria\r\nrostrata_ at Tahiti, and I saw the burrows myself amidst a dense growth of\r\nfern, &c., at 4,400 feet elevation in that island. Phaethon has a similar\r\nhabit. It nests at the crater of Kilauea, Hawaii, at 4,000 feet elevation,\r\nand also high up in Tahiti. In order to account for the transportation of\r\nthe plants, it is not of course necessary that the same species of\r\nProcellaria or Diomedea should now range between the distant points where\r\nthe plants occur. The ancestor of the now differing species might have\r\ncarried the seeds. The range of the genus is sufficient.\"\r\n\r\n[106] _Nature_, Vol. VI. p. 262, \"Recent Observations in the Bermudas,\" by\r\nMr. J. Matthew Jones.\r\n\r\n[107] \"The late Sir C. Wyville Thomson was of opinion that the 'red earth'\r\nwhich largely forms the soil of Bermuda had an organic origin, as well as\r\nthe 'red clay' which the _Challenger_ discovered in all the greater depths\r\nof the ocean basins. He regarded the red earth and red clay as an ash left\r\nbehind after the gradual removal of the lime by water charged with carbonic\r\nacid. This ash he regarded as a constituent part of the shells of\r\nForaminifera, skeletons of Corals, and Molluscs, [_vide_ _Voyage of the\r\nChallenger_, Atlantic, Vol. I. p. 316]. This theory does not seem to be in\r\nany way tenable. Analysis of carefully selected shells of Foraminifera,\r\nHeteropods, and Pteropods, did not show the slightest trace of alumina, and\r\nnone has as yet been discovered in coral skeletons. It is most probable\r\nthat a large part of the clayey matter found in red clay and the red earth\r\nof Bermuda is derived from the disintegration of pumice, which is\r\ncontinually found floating on the surface of the sea. [See Murray, \"On the\r\nDistribution of Volcanic Debris Over the Floor of the Ocean;\" _Proc. Roy.\r\nSoc. Edin._ Vol. IX. pp. 247-261. 1876-1877.] The naturalists of the\r\n_Challenger_ found it among the floating masses of gulf weed, and it is\r\nfrequently picked up on the reefs of Bermuda and other coral islands. The\r\nred earth contains a good many fragments of magnetite, augite, felspar, and\r\nglassy fragments, and when a large quantity of the rock of Bermuda is\r\ndissolved away with acid, a small number of fragments are also met with.\r\nThese mineral particles most probably came originally from the pumice which\r\nhad been cast up on the island for long ages (for it is known that these\r\nminerals are present in pumice), although possibly some of them may have\r\ncome from the volcanic rock, which is believed to form the nucleus of the\r\nisland.\" _The Voyage of H.M.S.

Forbes, who visited these islands in 1878, increased the\r\nnumber of wild plants to thirty-six, and these belonged to twenty-six\r\nnatural orders.\r\n\r\n[115] Juan Fernandez is a good example of a small island which, with time\r\nand favourable conditions, has acquired a tolerably rich and highly\r\npeculiar flora and fauna. It is situated in 34deg S. Lat., 400 miles from\r\nthe coast of Chile, and so far as facilities for the transport of living\r\norganisms are concerned is by no means in a favourable position, for the\r\nocean-currents come from the south-west in a direction where there is no\r\nland but the Antarctic continent, and the prevalent winds are also\r\nwesterly. No doubt, however, there are occasional storms, and there may\r\nhave been intermediate islands, but its chief advantages are its antiquity,\r\nits varied surface, and its favourable soil and climate, offering many\r\nchances for the preservation and increase of whatever plants and animals\r\nhave chanced to reach it. The island consists of basalt, greenstone, and\r\nother ancient rocks, and though only about twelve miles long its mountains\r\nare three thousand feet high. Enjoying a moist and temperate climate it is\r\nespecially adapted to the growth of ferns, which are very abundant; and as\r\nthe spores of these plants are as fine as dust, and very easily carried for\r\nenormous distances by winds, it is not surprising that there are nearly\r\nfifty species on the island, while the remote period when it first received\r\nits vegetation may be indicated by the fact that nearly half the species\r\nare quite peculiar; while of 102 species of flowering plants seventy are\r\npeculiar, and there are ten peculiar genera. The same general character\r\npervades the fauna. For so small an island it is rich, containing four true\r\nland-birds, about fifty species of insects, and twenty of land-shells.\r\nAlmost all these belong to South American genera, and a large proportion\r\nare South American species; but several of the insects, half the birds, and\r\nthe whole of the land-shells are peculiar. This seems to indicate that the\r\nmeans of transmission were formerly greater than they are now, and that in\r\nthe case of land-shells none have been introduced for so long a period that\r\nall have become modified into distinct forms, or have been preserved on the\r\nisland while they have become extinct on the continent. For a detailed\r\nexamination of the causes which have led to the modification of the humming\r\nbirds of Juan Fernandez see the chapter on Humming Birds in the author's\r\n_Natural Selection and Tropical Nature_, p. 324; while a general account of\r\nthe fauna of the island is given in his _Geographical Distribution of\r\nAnimals_, Vol. II. p. 49.\r\n\r\n[116] No additions appear to have been made to this flora down to 1885,\r\nwhen Mr. Hemsley published his _Report on the Present State of our\r\nKnowledge of Insular Floras_.\r\n\r\n[117] _Journal of the Linnean Society_, Vol. XIII., \"Botany,\" p. 556.\r\n\r\n[118] _Geographical Distribution of Animals_, Vol. II. p. 81.\r\n\r\n[119] _St. Helena: a Physical, Historical, and Topographical Description of\r\nthe Island, &c._ By John Charles Melliss, F.G.S., &c. London: 1875.\r\n\r\n[120] Mr. Marsh in his interesting work entitled _The Earth as Modified by\r\nHuman Action_ (p. 51), thus remarks on the effect of browsing quadrupeds in\r\ndestroying and checking woody vegetation.--\"I am convinced that forests\r\nwould soon cover many parts of the Arabian and African deserts if man and\r\ndomestic animals, especially the goat and the camel, were banished from\r\nthem. The hard palate and tongue, and strong teeth and jaws of this latter\r\nquadruped enable him to break off and masticate tough and thorny branches\r\nas large as the finger. He is particularly fond of the smaller twigs,\r\nleaves, and seed-pods of the _Sont_ and other acacias, which, like the\r\nAmerican robinia, thrive well on dry and sandy soils, and he spares no tree\r\nthe branches of which are within his reach, except, if I remember right,\r\nthe tamarisk that produces manna. Young trees sprout plentifully around the\r\nsprings and along the winter water-courses of the desert, and these are\r\njust the halting stations of the caravans and their routes of travel. In\r\nthe shade of these trees annual grasses and perennial shrubs shoot up, but\r\nare mown down by the hungry cattle of the Bedouin as fast as they grow. A\r\nfew years of undisturbed vegetation would suffice to cover such points with\r\ngroves, and these would gradually extend themselves over soils where now\r\nscarcely any green thing but the bitter colocynth and the poisonous\r\nfoxglove is ever seen.\"\r\n\r\n[121] _Coleoptera Sanctae Helenae_, 1877; _Testacea Atlantica_, 1878.\r\n\r\n[122] On Petermann's map of Africa, in _Stieler's Hand-Atlas_ (1879), the\r\nIsland of Ascension is shown as seated on a much larger and shallower\r\nsubmarine bank than St. Helena. The 1,000 fathom line round Ascension\r\nencloses an oval space 170 miles long by 70 wide, and even the 300 fathom\r\nline, one over 60 miles long; and it is therefore probable that a much\r\nlarger island once occupied this site. Now Ascension is nearly equidistant\r\nbetween St. Helena and Liberia, and such an island might have served as an\r\nintermediate station through which many of the immigrants to St. Helena\r\npassed. As the distances are hardly greater than in the case of the Azores,\r\nthis removes whatever difficulty may have been felt of the possibility of\r\n_any_ organisms reaching so remote an island. The present island of\r\nAscension is probably only the summit of a huge volcanic mass, and any\r\nremnant of the original fauna and flora it might have preserved may have\r\nbeen destroyed by great volcanic eruptions. Mr. Darwin collected some\r\nmasses of tufa which were found to be mainly organic, containing, besides\r\nremains of fresh-water infusoria, the siliceous tissue of plants! In the\r\nlight of the great extent of the submarine bank on which the island stands,\r\nMr. Darwin's remark, that--\"we may feel sure, that at some former epoch,\r\nthe climate and productions of Ascension were very different from what they\r\nare now,\"--has received a striking confirmation.

The numerous Lobeliaceae, all\r\nendemic, are mostly shrubs or trees, often resembling palms or yuccas in\r\nhabit, and sometimes twenty-five or thirty feet high. The only native genus\r\nof Primulaceae--Lysimachia--consists mainly of shrubs; and even a plantain\r\nhas a woody stem sometimes six feet high.\r\n\r\n[131] _Geological Magazine_, 1870, p. 155.\r\n\r\n[132] _Transactions of the Edinburgh Geological Society_, Vol. I. p. 330.\r\n\r\n[133] _Quarterly Journal of Geological Society_, 1850, p. 96.\r\n\r\n[134] _British Association Report_, Dundee, 1867, p. 431.\r\n\r\n[135] The list of names was furnished to me by Dr. Guenther, and I have\r\nadded the localities from the papers containing the original descriptions,\r\nand from Dr. Haughton's _British Freshwater Fishes_.\r\n\r\n[136] See \"The Virginia Colony of Helix nemoralis,\" T. D. A. Cockerell, in\r\n_The Nautilus_, Vol. III. No. 7, p. 73.\r\n\r\n[137] I am indebted to Mr. Mitten for this curious fact.\r\n\r\n[138] The following remarks by Dr. Richard Spruce, who has made a special\r\nstudy of mosses and especially of hepaticae, are of interest. \"From what\r\nprecedes, I conclude that no existing agency is capable of transporting the\r\ngerms of our hepatics of tropical type from the torrid zone to Britain, and\r\nI venture to suppose that their existence at Killarney dates from the\r\nremote period when the vegetation of the whole northern hemisphere partook\r\nof a tropical character. If I am challenged to account for their survival\r\nthrough the last glacial period, I reply that, granting even the existence\r\nof a universal ice-cap down to the latitude of 40deg in America and 50deg\r\nin Europe, it is not to be assumed that the whole extent, even of land, was\r\n_perennially_ entombed 'in thrilling regions of thick-ribbed ice.' Towards\r\nthe southern margin of the ice the climate was probably very similar to\r\nthat of Greenland and the northern part of Norway at the present day. The\r\nsummer sun would have great power, and on the borders of sheltered fjords\r\nthe frozen snow would disappear completely, if only for a very short\r\nperiod, and I ask only for a month or two, not doubting the capacity of our\r\nhepatics to survive in a dormant state under the snow for at least ten\r\nmonths in the year. I have gathered mosses in the Pyrenees where the snow\r\nhad barely left them on August 2nd; by September 25th they were re-covered\r\nwith snow, and would not be again uncovered till the following year. The\r\nmosses of Killarney might even enjoy a longer summer than this; for the\r\ngulf-stream laves both sides of the south-western angle of Ireland, and its\r\ntepid waters would exert great melting power on the ice-bound coast,\r\npreventing at the same time any formation of ice in the sea itself.\" This\r\npassage is the conclusion of a very interesting discussion on the\r\ndistribution of hepaticae in a paper on \"A New Hepatic from Killarney,\" in\r\nthe _Journal of Botany_, vol. 25, (Feb. 1887), pp. 33-82, in which many\r\ncurious facts are given as to the habits and distribution of these curious\r\nand beautiful little plants.\r\n\r\n[139] While these pages are passing through the press I am informed by my\r\nfriend Mr. W. H. Beeby that in the Shetland Isles, where he has been\r\ncollecting for five summers, he has found several plants new to the British\r\nflora, and a few altogether undescribed. Among these latter is a very\r\ndistinct species of Hieracium (_H. Zetlandicum_), which is quite unknown in\r\nScandinavia, and is almost certainly peculiar to the British Islands. Here\r\nwe have another proof that entirely new species are still to be discovered\r\nin the remoter portions of our country.\r\n\r\n[140] In the first edition of this work the numbers were 400 and 340,\r\nshowing the great increase of our knowledge during the last ten years,\r\nchiefly owing to the researches of Mr. A. H.

Blakiston and Pryer's _Catalogue of Birds of\r\nJapan_ (_Ibis_, 1878, p. 209), with Mr. Seebohm's additions and corrections\r\nin his _Birds of the Japanese Empire_ 1890. Accidental stragglers are not\r\nreckoned as British birds.\r\n\r\n[147] Mr. Swinhoe died in October, 1877, at the early age of forty-two. His\r\nwritings on natural history are chiefly scattered through the volumes of\r\nthe _Proceedings of the Zoological Society_ and _The Ibis_; the whole being\r\nsummarised in his _Catalogue of the Mammals of South China and Formosa_\r\n(_P. Z. S._, 1870, p. 615), and his _Catalogue of the Birds of China and\r\nits Islands_ (_P. Z. S._, 1871, p. 337).\r\n\r\n[148] Captain Blakiston has shown that the northern island--Yezo--is much\r\nmore temperate and less peculiar in its zoology than the central and\r\nsouthern islands. This is no doubt dependent chiefly on the considerable\r\nchange of climate that occurs on passing the Tsu-garu strait.\r\n\r\n[149] See Dr. J. E. Gray's \"Revision of the Viverridae,\" in _Proc. Zool.\r\nSoc._ 1864, p. 507.\r\n\r\n[150] Some of the Bats of Madagascar and East Africa are said to have their\r\nnearest allies in Australia. (See Dobson in _Nature_, Vol. XXX. p. 575.)\r\n\r\n[151] This view was, I believe, first advanced by Professor Huxley in his\r\n\"Anniversary Address to the Geological Society,\" in 1870. He says:--\"In\r\nfact the Miocene mammalian fauna of Europe and the Himalayan regions\r\ncontain, associated together, the types which are at present separately\r\nlocated in the South African and Indian provinces of Arctogaea. Now there\r\nis every reason to believe, on other grounds, that both Hindostan south of\r\nthe Ganges, and Africa south of the Sahara, were separated by a wide sea\r\nfrom Europe and North Asia during the Middle and Upper Eocene epochs. Hence\r\nit becomes highly probable that the well-known similarities, and no less\r\nremarkable differences, between the present faunae of India and South\r\nAfrica have arisen in some such fashion as the following: Some time during\r\nthe Miocene epoch, the bottom of the nummulitic sea was upheaved and\r\nconverted into dry land in the direction of a line extending from Abyssinia\r\nto the mouth of the Ganges. By this means the Dekkan on the one hand and\r\nSouth Africa on the other, became connected with the Miocene dry land and\r\nwith one another. The Miocene mammals spread gradually over this\r\nintermediate dry land; and if the condition of its eastern and western ends\r\noffered as wide contrasts as the valleys of the Ganges and Arabia do now,\r\nmany forms which made their way into Africa must have been different from\r\nthose which reached the Dekkan, while others might pass into both these\r\nsub-provinces.\"\r\n\r\nThis question is fully discussed in my _Geographical Distribution of\r\nAnimals_ (Vol. I., p. 285), where I expressed views somewhat different from\r\nthose of Professor Huxley, and made some slight errors which are corrected\r\nin the present work. As I did not then refer to Professor Huxley's prior\r\nstatement of the theory of Miocene immigration into Africa (which I had\r\nread but the reference to which I could not recall) I am happy to give his\r\nviews here.\r\n\r\n[152] The total number of Madagascar birds is 238, of which 129 are\r\nabsolutely peculiar to the island, as are thirty-five of the genera. All\r\nthe peculiar birds but two are land birds. These are the numbers given in\r\nM. Grandidier's great work on Madagascar.\r\n\r\n[153] _The Ibis_, 1877, p. 334.\r\n\r\n[154] In a paper read before the Geological Society in 1874, Mr. H. F.\r\nBlanford, from the similarity of the fossil plants and reptiles, supposed\r\nthat India and South Africa had been connected by a continent, \"and\r\nremained so connected with some short intervals from the Permian up to the\r\nend of the Miocene period,\" and Mr. Woodward expressed his satisfaction\r\nwith \"this further evidence derived from the fossil flora of the Mesozoic\r\nseries of India in corroboration of the former existence of an old\r\nsubmerged continent--Lemuria.\"\r\n\r\nThose who have read the preceding chapters of the present work will not\r\nneed to have pointed out to them how utterly inconclusive is the\r\nfragmentary evidence derived from such remote periods (even if there were\r\nno evidence on the other side) as indicating geographical changes. The\r\nnotion that a similarity in the productions of widely separated continents\r\nat any past epoch is only to be explained by the existence of a _direct_\r\nland-connection, is entirely opposed to all that we know of the wide and\r\nvarying distribution of _all_ types at different periods, as well as to the\r\ngreat powers of dispersal over moderate widths of ocean possessed by all\r\nanimals except mammalia. It is no less opposed to what is now known of the\r\ngeneral permanency of the great continental and oceanic areas; while in\r\nthis particular case it is totally inconsistent (as has been shown above)\r\nwith the actual facts of the distribution of animals.\r\n\r\n[155] _Geographical Distribution of Animals_, Vol. I., pp. 272-292.\r\n\r\n[156] The term \"Mascarene\" is used here in an extended sense, to include\r\nall the islands near Madagascar which resemble it in their animal and\r\nvegetable productions.\r\n\r\n[157] For the birds of the Comoro Islands see _Proc. Zool. Soc._, 1877, p.\r\n295, and 1879, p. 673.\r\n\r\n[158] The following is a list of these peculiar birds. (See the _Ibis_, for\r\n1867, p. 359; and 1879, p. 97.)\r\n\r\n  PASSERES.\r\n\r\n  _Ellisia seychelensis._\r\n  _Copsychus seychellarum._\r\n  _Hypsipetes crassirostris._\r\n  _Tchitrea corvina._\r\n  _Nectarinia dussumieri._\r\n  _Zosterops modesta._\r\n        \"   _semiflava._\r\n  _Foudia seychellarum._\r\n\r\n  PSITTACI.\r\n\r\n  _Coracopsis barklyi._\r\n  _Palaeornis wardi._\r\n\r\n  COLUMBAE.\r\n\r\n  _Alectoraenas pulcherrimus._\r\n  _Turtur rostratus._\r\n\r\n  ACCIPITRES.\r\n\r\n  _Tinnunculus gracilis._\r\n\r\n[159] Specimens are recorded from West Africa in the _Proceedings of the\r\nAcademy of Natural Science_, Philadelphia, 1857, p. 72, while specimens in\r\nthe Paris Museum were brought by D'Orbigny from S. America. Dr. Wright's\r\nspecimens from the Seychelles have, as he informs me, been determined to be\r\nthe same species by Dr. Peters of Berlin.\r\n\r\n[160] \"Additional Notes on the Land-shells of the Seychelles Islands.\" By\r\nGeoffrey Nevill, C.M.Z.S. _Proc. Zool. Soc._ 1869, p. 61.\r\n\r\n[161] In Maillard's _Notes sur l'Isle de Reunion_, a considerable number of\r\nmammalia are given as \"wild,\" such as _Lemur mongoz_ and _Centetes\r\nsetosus_, both Madagascar species, with such undoubtedly introduced animals\r\nas a wild cat, a hare, and several rats and mice. He also gives two species\r\nof frogs, seven lizards, and two snakes. The latter are both Indian species\r\nand certainly imported, as are most probably the frogs. Legouat, who\r\nresided some years in the island nearly two centuries ago, and who was a\r\ncloser observer of nature, mentions numerous birds, large bats,\r\nland-tortoises, and lizards, but no other reptiles or venomous animals\r\nexcept scorpions. We may be pretty sure, therefore, that the land-mammalia,\r\nsnakes, and frogs, now found wild, have all been introduced. Of lizards, on\r\nthe other hand, there are several species, some peculiar to the island,\r\nothers common to Africa and the other Mascarene Islands. The following list\r\nby Prof. Dumeril is given in Maillard's work:--\r\n\r\n  _Platydactylus cepedianus._\r\n       \"        _ocellatus._\r\n  _Hemidactylus peronii._\r\n       \"       _mutilatus._\r\n  _Hemidactylus frenatus._\r\n  _Gongylus bojerii._\r\n  _Ablepharus peronii._\r\n\r\nFour species of chameleon are now recorded from Bourbon and one from\r\nMauritius (J. Reay Greene, M.D., in _Pop. Science Rev._ April, 1880), but\r\nas they are not mentioned by the old writers, it is pretty certain that\r\nthese creatures are recent introductions, and this is the more probable as\r\nthey are favourite domestic pets.\r\n\r\nDarwin informed me that in a work entitled _Voyage a l'Isle de France, par\r\nun Officier du Roi_, published in 1770, it is stated that a fresh-water\r\nfish had been introduced from Batavia and had multiplied. The writer also\r\nsays (p. 170): \"_On a essaye, mais sans succces, d'y transporter des\r\ngrenouilles qui mangent les oeufs que les moustigues deposent sur les eaux\r\nstagnantes._\" It thus appears that there were then no frogs on the island.\r\n\r\n[162] That the dodo is really an abortion from a more perfect type, and not\r\na direct development from some lower form of wingless bird, is shown by its\r\npossessing a keeled sternum, though the keel is exceedingly reduced, being\r\nonly three-quarters of an inch deep in a length of seven inches. The most\r\nterrestrial pigeon--the Didunculus of the Samoan Islands, has a far deeper\r\nand better developed keel, showing that in the case of the dodo the\r\ndegradation has been extreme. We have also analogous examples in other\r\nextinct birds of the same group of islands, such as the flightless\r\nRails--Aphanapteryx of Mauritius and Erythromachus of Rodriguez, as well as\r\nthe large parrot--Lophopsittacus of Mauritius, and the Night Heron,\r\n_Nycticorax megacephala_ of Rodriguez, the last two birds probably having\r\nbeen able to fly a little. The commencement of the same process is to be\r\nseen in the peculiar dove of the Seychelles, _Turtur rostratus_, which, as\r\nMr. Edward Newton has shown, has much shorter wings than its close ally,\r\n_T. picturatus_, of Madagascar. For a full and interesting account of these\r\nand other recently extinct birds see Professor Newton's article on \"Fossil\r\nBirds\" in the _Encyclopaedia Britannica_, ninth edition, vol. iii., p. 732;\r\nand that on \"The Extinct Birds of Rodriguez,\" by Dr. A. Guenther and Mr. E.\r\nNewton, in the Royal Society's volume on the Transit of Venus Expedition.\r\n\r\n[163] See _Ibis_, 1877, p. 334.\r\n\r\n[164] A common Indian and Malayan toad (_Bufo melanostictus_) has been\r\nintroduced into Mauritius and also some European toads, as I am informed by\r\nDr. Guenther.\r\n\r\n[165] This brief account of the Madagascar flora has been taken from a very\r\ninteresting paper by the Rev. Richard Baron, F.L.S., F.G.S., in the\r\n_Journal of the Linnean Society_, Vol. XXV., p. 246; where much information\r\nis given on the distribution of the flora within the island.\r\n\r\n[166] It may be interesting to botanists and to students of geographical\r\ndistribution to give here an enumeration of the endemic genera of the\r\n_Flora of the Mauritius and the Seychelles_, as they are nowhere separately\r\ntabulated in that work.\r\n\r\n  Aphloia (Bixaceae)              1 sp., a shrub, Maur., Rod., Sey., also\r\n                                     Madagascar.\r\n  Medusagyne (Ternstroemiaceae)   1 sp., a shrub, Seychelles.\r\n  Astiria (Sterculiaceae)         1 sp., a shrub, Mauritius.\r\n  Quivisia (Meliaceae)            3 sp., shrubs, Mauritius (2 sp.),\r\n                                     Rodriguez (1 sp.), also Bourbon.\r\n  Cossignya (Sapindaceae)         1 sp., a shrub, Mauritius, also Bourbon.\r\n  Hornea         ,,               1 sp., a shrub, Mauritius.\r\n  Stadtmannia    ,,               1 sp., a shrub, Mauritius.\r\n  Doratoxylon    ,,               1 sp., a shrub, Mauritius and Bourbon.\r\n  Gagnebina (Leguminosae)         1 sp., a shrub, Mauritius, also\r\n                                     Madagascar.\r\n  Roussea (Saxifragaceae)         1 sp., a climbing shrub, Mauritius and\r\n                                     Bourbon.\r\n  Tetrataxis (Lythraceae)         1 sp., a shrub, Mauritius.\r\n  Psiloxylon     ,,               1 sp., a shrub, Mauritius and Bourbon.\r\n  Mathurina (Turneraceae)         1 sp., a shrub, Rodriguez.\r\n  Foetidia (Myrtaceae)            1 sp., a tree, Mauritius.\r\n  Danais (Rubiaceae)              4 sp., climbing shrubs, Maur.

He says, \"A four-footed animal was seen by\r\nthree or four of our people, but as no two gave the same description of it,\r\nI cannot say what kind it is. All, however, agreed that it was about the\r\nsize of a cat, with short legs, and of a mouse colour. One of the seamen,\r\nand he who had the best view of it, said it had a bushy tail, and was the\r\nmost like a jackal of any animal he knew.\" It is suggestive that, so far as\r\nthe points on which \"all agreed\"--the size and the dark colour--this\r\ndescription would answer well to the animal so recently seen, while the\r\n\"short legs\" correspond to the otter-like tracks, and the thick tail of an\r\notter-like animal may well have appeared \"bushy\" when the fur was dry. It\r\nhas been suggested that it was only one of the native dogs; but as none of\r\nthose who saw it took it for a dog, and the points on which they all agreed\r\nare not dog-like, we can hardly accept this explanation; while the actual\r\nexistence of an unknown animal in New Zealand of corresponding size and\r\ncolour is confirmed by this account of a similar animal having been seen\r\nabout a century ago.\r\n\r\n[173] Owen, \"On the Genus Dinornis,\" _Trans.

He says that the histories and songs of the Maoris abound in\r\nallusions to the Moa, and that they were able to give full accounts of \"its\r\nhabits, food, the season of the year it was killed, its appearance,\r\nstrength, and all the numerous ceremonies which were enacted by the natives\r\nbefore they began the hunt, the mode of hunting, how cut up, how cooked,\r\nand what wood was used in the cooking, with an account of its nest, and how\r\nthe nest was made, where it usually lived, &c.\" Two pages are occupied by\r\nthese details, but they are only given from memory, and Mr. White promises\r\na full account from his MSS. Many of the details given correspond with\r\nfacts ascertained from the discovery of native cooking places with Moas'\r\nbones; and it seems quite incredible that such an elaborate and detailed\r\naccount should be all invention.

Institute_, Vol. III., plate 12_b._ fig.\r\n2.\r\n\r\n[176] _Geographical Distribution of Animals_, Vol. I., p. 450.\r\n\r\n[177] In my _Geographical Distribution of Animals_ (I. p. 541) I have given\r\ntwo peculiar Australian genera (_Orthonyx_ and _Tribonyx_) as occurring in\r\nNew Zealand. But the former has been found in New Guinea, while the New\r\nZealand bird is considered to form a distinct genus, _Clitonyx_; and the\r\nlatter inhabits Tasmania, and was recorded from New Zealand through an\r\nerror. (See _Ibis_, 1873, p. 427.)\r\n\r\n[178] The peculiar genera of Australian lizards according to Boulenger's\r\nBritish Museum Catalogue, are as follows:--Family GECKONIDAE: Nephrurus,\r\nRhynchoedura, Heteronota, Diplodactylus, Oedura. Family PYGOPODIDAE\r\n(peculiar): Pygopus, Cryptodelma, Delma, Pletholax, Aprasia. Family\r\nAGAMIDAE: Chelosania, Amphibolurus, Tympanocryptis, Diporophora,\r\nChlamydosaurus, Moloch, Oreodeira. Family SCINCIDAE: Egerina, Trachysaurus,\r\nHemisphaenodon. Family doubtful: Ophiopsiseps.\r\n\r\n[179] These figures are taken from Mr. G. M. Thomson's address \"On the\r\nOrigin of the New Zealand Flora,\" _Trans. N. Z. Institute_, XIV. (1881),\r\nbeing the latest that I can obtain. They differ somewhat from those given\r\nin the first edition, but not so as to affect the conclusions drawn from\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n[180] This accords with the general scarcity of Leguminosae in Oceanic\r\nIslands, due probably to their usually dry and heavy seeds, not adapted to\r\nany of the forms of aerial transmission; and it would indicate either that\r\nNew Zealand was never absolutely united with Australia, or that the union\r\nwas at a very remote period when Leguminosae were either not differentiated\r\nor comparatively rare.\r\n\r\n[181] Sir Joseph Hooker informs me that the number of tropical Australian\r\nplants discovered within the last twenty years is very great, and that the\r\nstatement as above made may have to be modified. Looking, however, at the\r\nenormous disproportion of the figures given in the \"Introductory Essay\" in\r\n1859 (2,200 tropical to 5,800 temperate species) it seems hardly possible\r\nthat a great difference should not still exist, at all events as regards\r\nspecies. In Baron von Mueeller's latest summary of the Australian Flora\r\n(_Second Systematic Census of Australian Plants_, 1889), he gives the total\r\nspecies at 8,839, of which 3,560 occur in West Australia, and 3,251 in New\r\nSouth Wales. On counting the species common to these two colonies in fifty\r\npages of the _Census_ taken at random, I find them to be about one-tenth of\r\nthe total species in both. This would give the number of distinct species\r\nin these areas as about 6,130. Adding to these the species peculiar to\r\nVictoria and South Australia, we shall have a flora of near 6,500 in the\r\ntemperate parts of Australia. It is true that West Australia extends far\r\ninto the tropics, but an overwhelming majority of the species have been\r\ndiscovered in the south-western portion of the colony, while the species\r\nthat may be exclusively tropical will be more than balanced by those of\r\ntemperate Queensland, which have not been taken account of, as that colony\r\nis half temperate and half tropical. It thus appears probable that full\r\nthree fourths of the species of Australian plants occur in the temperate\r\nregions, and are mainly characteristic of it. Sir Joseph Hooker also doubts\r\nthe generally greater richness of tropical over temperate floras which I\r\nhave taken as almost an axiom. He says: \"Taking similar areas to Australia\r\nin the Western World, _e.g._, tropical Africa north of 20deg S. Lat. as\r\nagainst temperate Africa and Europe up to 47deg--I suspect that the latter\r\nwould present more genera and species than the former.\" This, however,\r\nappears to me to be hardly a case in point, because Europe is a distinct\r\ncontinent from Africa and has had a very different past history, and it is\r\nnot a fair comparison to take the tropical area in one continent while the\r\ntemperate is made up of widely separated areas in two continents. A closer\r\nparallel may perhaps be found in equal areas of Brazil and south temperate\r\nAmerica, or of Mexico and the Southern United States, in both of which\r\ncases I suppose there can be little doubt that the tropical areas are far\r\nthe richest. Temperate South Africa is, no doubt, always quoted as richer\r\nthan an equal area of tropical Africa or perhaps than any part of the world\r\nof equal extent, but this is admitted to be an exceptional case.\r\n\r\n[182] Sir Joseph Hooker thinks that later discoveries in the Australian\r\nAlps and other parts of East and South Australia may have greatly modified\r\nor perhaps reversed the above estimate, and the figures given in the\r\npreceding note indicate that this is so. But still, the small area of\r\nSouth-west Australia will be, proportionally, far the richer of the two. It\r\nis much to be desired that the enormous mass of facts contained in Mr.\r\nBentham's _Flora Australiensis_ and Baron von Mueeller's _Census_ should be\r\ntabulated and compared by some competent botanist, so as to exhibit the\r\nvarious relations of its wonderful vegetation in the same manner as was\r\ndone by Sir Joseph Hooker with the materials available twenty-one years\r\nago.\r\n\r\n[183] From an examination of the fossil corals of the South-west of\r\nVictoria, Professor P. M. Duncan concludes--\"that, at the time of the\r\nformation of these deposits the central area of Australia was occupied by\r\nsea, having open water to the north, with reefs in the neighbourhood of\r\nJava.\" The age of these fossils is not known, but as almost all are extinct\r\nspecies, and some are almost identical with European Pliocene and Miocene\r\nspecies, they are supposed to belong to a corresponding period. (_Journal\r\nof Geol. Soc._, 1870.)\r\n\r\n[184] \"On the Origin of the Fauna and Flora of New Zealand,\" by Captain\r\nF. W. Hutton, in _Annals and Mag. of Nat. Hist._ Fifth series, p. 427\r\n(June, 1884).\r\n\r\n[185] To these must now be added the genera Sequoia, Myrica, Aralia, and\r\nAcer, described by Baron von Ettingshausen. (_Trans. N.Z. Institute_, xix.,\r\np. 449.)\r\n\r\n[186] The large collection of fossil plants from the Tertiary beds of New\r\nZealand which have been recently described by Baron von Ettingshausen\r\n(_Trans. N. Z. Inst._, vol. xxiii., pp. 237-310), prove that a change in\r\nthe vegetation has occurred similar to that which has taken place in\r\nEastern Australia, and that the plants of the two countries once resembled\r\neach other more than they do now. We have, first, a series of groups now\r\nliving in Australia, but which have become extinct in New Zealand, as\r\nCassia, Dalbergia, Eucalyptus, Diospyros, Dryandra, Casuarina, and Ficus;\r\nand also such northern genera as Acer, Planera, Ulmus, Quercus, Alnus,\r\nMyrica, and Sequoia. All these latter, except Ulmus and Planera, have been\r\nfound also in the Eastern-Australian Tertiaries, and we may therefore\r\nconsider that at this period the northern temperate element in both floras\r\nwas identical. If this flora entered both countries from the south, and was\r\nreally Antarctic, its extinction in New Zealand may have been due to the\r\nsubmergence of the country to the south, and its elevation and extension\r\ntowards the tropics, admitting of the incursion of the large number of\r\nPolynesian and tropical Australian types now found there; while the\r\nAustralian portion of the same flora may have succumbed at a somewhat later\r\nperiod, when the elevation of the Cretaceous and Tertiary sea united it\r\nwith Western Australia, and allowed the rich typical Australian flora to\r\noverrun the country. Of course we are assuming that the identification of\r\nthese genera is for the most part correct, though almost entirely founded\r\non leaves only. Fuller knowledge, both of the extinct flora itself and of\r\nthe geological age of the several deposits, is requisite before any\r\ntrustworthy explanation of the phenomena can be arrived at.\r\n\r\n[187] The following are the tropical genera common to New Zealand and\r\nAustralia:--\r\n\r\n  1. _Melicope._ Queensland, Pacific Islands.\r\n  2. _Eugenia._ Eastern and Tropical Australia, Asia, and America.\r\n  3. _Passiflora._ N.S.W. and Queensland, Tropics of Old World and America.\r\n  4. _Myrsine._ Tropical and Temperate Australia, Tropical and Sub-tropical\r\n      regions.\r\n  5. _Sapota._ Australia, Norfolk Islands, Tropics.\r\n  6. _Cyathodes._ Australia and Pacific Islands.\r\n  7. _Parsonsia._ Tropical Australia and Asia.\r\n  8. _Geniostoma._ Queensland, Polynesia, Asia.\r\n  9. _Mitrasacme._ Tropical and Temperate Australia, India.\r\n  10. _Ipomoea._ Tropical Australia, Tropics.\r\n  11. _Mazus._ Temperate Australia, India, China.\r\n  12. _Vitex._ Tropical Australia, Tropical and Sub-tropical.\r\n  13. _Pisonia._ Tropical Australia, Tropical and Sub-tropical.\r\n  14. _Alternanthera._ Tropical Australia, India, and S.

Ent. Soc._, 1883.\r\np. xxix.)\r\n\r\n[189] Introductory Essay _On the Flora of Australia_, p. 130.\r\n\r\n[190] Hooker, _On the Flora of Australia_, p. 95.--H. C. Watson, in\r\nGodman's _Azores_, pp. 278-286.\r\n\r\n[191] As this is a point of great interest in its bearing on the dispersal\r\nof plants by means of mountain ranges, I have endeavoured to obtain a few\r\nillustrative facts:--\r\n\r\n1. Mr. William Mitten, of Hurstpierpoint, Sussex, informs me that when the\r\nLondon and Brighton railway was in progress in his neighbourhood,\r\n_Melilotus vulgaris_ made its appearance on the banks, remained for several\r\nyears, and then altogether disappeared. Another case is that of _Diplotaxis\r\nmuralis_, which formerly occurred only near the sea-coast of Sussex, and at\r\nLewes; but since the railway was made has spread along it, and still\r\nmaintains itself abundantly on the railway banks though rarely found\r\nanywhere else.\r\n\r\n2. A correspondent in Tasmania informs me that whenever the virgin forest\r\nis cleared in that island there invariably comes up a thick crop of a plant\r\nlocally known as fire-weed--a species of Senecio, probably _S. Australis_.\r\nIt never grows except where the fire has gone over the ground, and is\r\nunknown except in such places. My correspondent adds:--\"This autumn I went\r\nback about thirty-five miles through a dense forest, along a track marked\r\nby some prospectors the year before, and in one spot where they had camped,\r\nand the fire had burnt the fallen logs, &c., there was a fine crop of\r\n'fire-weed.' All around for many miles was a forest of the largest trees\r\nand dense scrub.\" Here we have a case in which burnt soil and ashes favour\r\nthe germination of a particular plant, whose seeds are easily carried by\r\nthe wind, and it is not difficult to see how this peculiarity might favour\r\nthe dispersal of the species for enormous distances, by enabling it\r\ntemporarily to grow and produce seeds on burnt spots.\r\n\r\n3. In answer to an inquiry on this subject, Mr. H. C. Watson has been kind\r\nenough to send me a detailed account of the progress of vegetation on the\r\nrailway banks and cuttings about Thames Ditton. This account is written\r\nfrom memory, but as Mr. Watson states that he took a great interest in\r\nwatching the process year by year, there can be no reason to doubt the\r\naccuracy of his memory. I give a few extracts which bear especially on the\r\nsubject we are discussing.\r\n\r\n\"One rather remarkable biennial plant appeared early (the second year, as I\r\nrecollect) and renewed itself either two or three years, namely, _Isatis\r\ntinctoria_--a species usually supposed, to be one of our introduced, but\r\npretty well naturalised, plants. The nearest stations then or since known\r\nto me for this _Isatis_ are on chalk about Guildford, twenty miles distant.\r\nThere were two or three plants of it at first, never more than half a\r\ndozen. Once since I saw a plant of _Isatis_ on the railway bank near\r\nVauxhall.\r\n\r\n\"Close by Ditton Station three species appeared which may be called\r\ninterlopers. The biennial _Barbarea precox_, one of these, is the least\r\nremarkable, because it might have come as seed in the earth from some\r\ngarden, or possibly in the Thames gravel (used as ballast). At first it\r\nincreased to several plants, then became less numerous, and will soon, in\r\nall probability, become extinct, crowded out by other plants. The biennial\r\n_Petroselinum segetum_ was at first one very luxuriant plant on the slope\r\nof the embankment. It increased by seed into a dozen or a score, and is now\r\nnearly if not quite extinct. The third species is _Linaria purpurea_, not\r\nstrictly a British plant, but one established in some places on old walls.\r\nA single root of it appeared on the chalk facing of the embankment by\r\nDitton Station. It has remained there several years and grown into a\r\nvigorous specimen. Two or three smaller examples are now seen by it,\r\ndoubtless sprung from some of the hundreds or thousands of seeds shed by\r\nthe original one plant. The species is not included in Salmon and Brewer's\r\n_Flora of Surrey_.\r\n\r\n\"The main line of the railway has introduced into Ditton parish the\r\nperennial _Arabis hirsuta_, likely to become a permanent inhabitant. The\r\nspecies is found on the chalk and greensand miles away from Thames Ditton;\r\nbut neither in this parish nor in any adjacent parish, so far as known to\r\nmyself or to the authors of the flora of the county, does it occur. Some\r\nyears after the railway was made a single root of this _Arabis_ was\r\nobserved in the brickwork of an arch by which the railway is carried over a\r\npublic road. A year or two afterwards there were three or four plants. In\r\nsome later year I laid some of the ripened seed-pods between the bricks in\r\nplaces where the mortar had partly crumbled out. Now there are several\r\nscores of specimens in the brickwork of the arch. It is presumable that the\r\nfirst seed may have been brought from Guildford. But how could it get on to\r\nthe perpendicular face of the brickwork?\r\n\r\n\"The Bee Orchis (_Ophrys apifera_), plentiful on some of the chalk lands in\r\nSurrey, is not a species of Thames Ditton, or (as I presume) of any\r\nadjacent parish. Thus, I was greatly surprised some years back to see about\r\na hundred examples of it in flower in one clayey field either on the\r\noutskirts of Thames Ditton or just within the limits of the adjoining\r\nparish of Cobham. I had crossed this same field in a former year without\r\nobserving the Ophrys there. And on finding it in the one field I closely\r\nsearched the surrounding fields and copses, without finding it anywhere\r\nelse. Gradually the plants became fewer and fewer in that one field, and\r\nsome six or eight years after its first discovery there the species had\r\nquite disappeared again. I guessed it had been introduced with chalk, but\r\ncould obtain no evidence to show this.\"\r\n\r\n4. Mr. A. Bennett, of Croydon, has kindly furnished me with some\r\ninformation on the temporary vegetation of the banks and cuttings on the\r\nrailway from Yarmouth to Caistor in Norfolk, where it passes over extensive\r\nsandy Denes with a sparse vegetation. The first year after the railway was\r\nmade the banks produced abundance of _Oenothera odorata_ and _Delphinium\r\nAjacis_ (the latter only known thirty miles off in cornfields in\r\nCambridgeshire), with _Atriplex patula_ and _A. deltoidea_. Gradually the\r\nnative sand plants--Carices, Grasses, _Galium verum_, &c., established\r\nthemselves, and year by year covered more ground till the new introductions\r\nalmost completely disappeared. The same phenomenon was observed in\r\nCambridgeshire between Chesterton and Newmarket, where, the soil being\r\ndifferent, _Stellaria media_ and other annuals appeared in large patches;\r\nbut these soon gave way to a permanent vegetation of grasses, composites,\r\n&c., so that in the third year no _Stellaria_ was to be seen.\r\n\r\n5. Mr. T. Kirk (writing in 1878) states that--\"in Auckland, where a dense\r\nsward of grass is soon formed, single specimens of the European milk\r\nThistle (_Carduus marianus_) have been known for the past fifteen years;\r\nbut although they seeded freely, the seeds had no opportunity of\r\ngerminating, so that the thistle did not spread. A remarkable exception to\r\nthis rule occurred during the formation of the Onehunga railway, where a\r\nfew seeds fell on disturbed soil, grew up and flowered. The railway works\r\nbeing suspended, the plant increased rapidly, and spread wherever it could\r\nfind disturbed soil.\"\r\n\r\nAgain:--\"The fiddle-dock (_Rumex pulcher_) occurs in great abundance on the\r\nformation of new streets, &c., but soon becomes comparatively rare. It\r\nseems probable that it was one of the earliest plants naturalised here, but\r\nthat it partially died out, its buried seeds retaining their vitality.\"\r\n\r\n_Medicago sativa_ and _Apium graveolens_, are also noted as escapes from\r\ncultivation which maintain themselves for a time but soon die out.\r\n(_Transactions of the New Zealand Institute_, Vol. X. p. 367.)\r\n\r\nThe preceding examples of the _temporary_ establishment of plants on newly\r\nexposed soil, often at considerable distances from the localities they\r\nusually inhabit, might, no doubt, by further inquiry be greatly multiplied;\r\nbut, unfortunately, the phenomenon has received little attention, and is\r\nnot even referred to in the elaborate work of De Candolle (_Geographie\r\nBotanique Raisonnee_) in which almost every other aspect of the dispersion\r\nand distribution of plants is fully discussed. Enough has been advanced,\r\nhowever, to show that it is of constant occurrence, and from the point of\r\nview here advocated it becomes of great importance in explaining the almost\r\nworld-wide distribution of many common plants of the north temperate zone.\r\n\r\n[192] Sir Joseph Hooker informs me that he considers these identifications\r\nworthless, and Mr. Bentham has also written very strongly against the value\r\nof similar identifications by Heer and Unger. Giving due weight to the\r\nopinions of these eminent botanists we must admit that Australian genera\r\nhave not yet been _demonstrated_ to have existed in Europe during the\r\nTertiary period; but, on the other hand, the evidence that they did so\r\nappears to have some weight, on account of the improbability that the\r\nnumerous resemblances to Australian plants which have been noticed by\r\ndifferent observers should _all_ be illusory; while the well established\r\nfact of the former wide distribution of many tropical or now restricted\r\ntypes of plants and animals, so frequently illustrated in the present\r\nvolume, removes the antecedent improbability which is supposed to attach to\r\nsuch identifications. I am myself the more inclined to accept them,\r\nbecause, according to the views here advocated, such migrations must have\r\ntaken place at remote as well as at recent epochs; and the preservation of\r\nsome of these types in Australia while they have become extinct in Europe,\r\nis exactly paralleled by numerous facts in the distribution of animals\r\nwhich have been already referred to in Chapter XIX., and elsewhere in this\r\nvolume, and also repeatedly in my larger work.\r\n\r\n[193] Out of forty-two genera from the Eocene of Sheppey enumerated by Dr.\r\nEttingshausen in the _Geological Magazine_ for January 1880, only two or\r\nthree appear to be extinct, while there is a most extraordinary\r\nintermixture of tropical and temperate forms--Musa, Nipa, and Victoria,\r\nwith Corylus, Prunus, Acer, &c. The rich Miocene flora of Switzerland,\r\ndescribed by Professor Heer, presents a still larger proportion of living\r\ngenera.\r\n\r\n[194] The recent discovery by Lieutenant Jensen of a rich flora on rocky\r\npeaks rising out of the continental ice of Greenland, as well as the\r\nabundant vegetation of the highest northern latitudes, renders it possible\r\nthat even now the Antarctic continent may not be wholly destitute of\r\nvegetation, although its climate and physical condition are far less\r\nfavourable than those of the Arctic lands. (See _Nature_, Vol. XXI. p.\r\n345.)\r\n\r\n[195] Dr. Hector notes the occurrence of the genus _Dammara_ in Triassic\r\ndeposits, while in the Jurassic period New Zealand possessed the genera\r\n_Palaeozamia_, _Oleandrium_, _Alethopteris_, _Camptopteris_, _Cycadites_,\r\n_Echinostrobus_, &c., all Indian forms of the same age. Neocomian beds\r\ncontain a true dicotyledonous leaf with _Dammara_ and _Araucaria_. The\r\nCretaceous deposits have produced a rich flora of dicotyledonous plants,\r\nmany of which are of the same genera as the existing flora; while the\r\nMiocene and other Tertiary deposits produce plants almost identical with\r\nthose now inhabiting the country, together with many North Temperate genera\r\nwhich have since become extinct. (See p. 499, footnote, and _Trans. New\r\nZealand Inst._, Vol. XI. 1879, p. 536.)\r\n\r\n[196] The fact stated in the last edition of the _Origin of Species_ (p.\r\n340) on the authority of Sir Joseph Hooker, that Australian plants are\r\nrapidly sowing themselves and becoming naturalised on the Neilgherrie\r\nmountains in the southern part of the Indian Peninsula, though an exception\r\nto the rule of the inability of Australian plants to become naturalised in\r\nthe Northern Hemisphere, is yet quite in harmony with the hypothesis here\r\nadvocated. For not only is the climate of the Neilgherries more favourable\r\nto Australian plants than any part of the North Temperate zone, but the\r\nentire Indian Peninsula has existed for unknown ages as an _island_ and\r\nthus possesses the \"insular\" characteristic of a comparatively poor and\r\nless developed flora and fauna as compared with the truly \"continental\"\r\nMalayan and Himalayan regions. Australian plants are thus enabled to\r\ncompete with those of the Indian Peninsula highlands with a fair chance of\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nCorrections made to printed original.\r\n\r\nPage 10. \"the general stability of continents\": 'sontinents' in original.\r\n\r\nPages 35, 250, 361, 363 \"oenanthe\" read for \"aenanthe\" throughout for\r\nconsistency\r\n\r\nPage 50. \"some others of the lower animals\": 'animials' in original.\r\n\r\nPage 82. \"transmission along mountain chains\": 'mountains chains' in\r\noriginal.\r\n\r\nPage 99. \"our present land masses\": 'massses' in original.\r\n\r\nPage 149. \"the whole earth should theoretically be\": 'thoretically' in\r\noriginal.\r\n\r\nPage 200. \"the flora and fauna, in the British area\": 'Brittish' in\r\noriginal.\r\n\r\nPage 234. \"the indications of an uninterrupted warm climate\": 'indic-tions'\r\non line break in original.\r\n\r\nPage 306. \"artificially removed by man\": 'artifically' in original.\r\n\r\nPage 346. \"Elachista rufocinerea, the larva of which ...\": 'lava' in\r\noriginal.\r\n\r\nPage 456. \"Cynopithecus nigrescens\": 'Cynopitheus' in original.\r\n\r\nFootnote 100. \"S.
