It further\r\npossesses a grand mountain range, rivalling the Himalayas in altitude and\r\nfar surpassing them in extent, and which, being wholly situated within the\r\nregion and running through eighty degrees of latitude, offers a variety of\r\nconditions and an extent of mountain slopes, of lofty plateaus and of deep\r\nvalleys, which no other tropical region can approach. It has a further\r\nadvantage in a southward prolongation far into the temperate zone,\r\nequivalent to a still greater extension of its lofty plateaus; and this\r\nhas, no doubt, aided the development of the peculiar alpine forms of life\r\nwhich abound in the southern Andes. The climate of this region is\r\nexceptionally favourable. Owing to the lofty mountain range situated along\r\nits western margin, the moisture-laden trade winds from the Atlantic have\r\nfree access to the interior. A sufficient proportion of this moisture\r\nreaches the higher slopes of the Andes, where its condensation gives rise\r\nto innumerable streams, which cut deep ravines and carry down such an\r\namount of sediment, that they have formed the vast plains of the Amazon, of\r\n{4}Paraguay, and of the Orinooko out of what were once, no doubt, arms of\r\nthe sea, separating the large islands of Guiana, Brazil, and the Andes.\r\nFrom these concurrent favourable conditions, there has resulted that\r\ninexhaustible variety of generic and specific forms with a somewhat limited\r\nrange of family and ordinal types, which characterise neotropical zoology\r\nto a degree nowhere else to be met with.\r\n\r\nTogether with this variety and richness, there is a remarkable uniformity\r\nof animal life over all the tropical continental portions of the region, so\r\nthat its division into sub-regions is a matter of some difficulty. There\r\nis, however, no doubt about separating the West Indian islands as forming a\r\nwell-marked subdivision; characterised, not only by that poverty of forms\r\nwhich is a general feature of ancient insular groups, but also by a number\r\nof peculiar generic types, some of which are quite foreign to the remainder\r\nof the region. We must exclude, however, the islands of Trinidad, Tobago,\r\nand a few other small islands near the coast, which zoologically form a\r\npart of the main land. Again, the South Temperate portion of the continent,\r\ntogether with the high plateaus of the Andes to near the equator, form a\r\nwell-marked subdivision, characterised by a peculiar fauna, very distinct\r\nboth positively and negatively from that of the tropical lowland districts.\r\nThe rest of Tropical South America is so homogeneous in its forms of life\r\nthat it cannot be conveniently subdivided for the purposes of a work like\r\nthe present. There are, no doubt, considerable differences in various parts\r\nof its vast area, due partly to its having been once separated into three\r\nor more islands, in part to existing diversities of physical conditions;\r\nand more exact knowledge may enable us to form several provinces or perhaps\r\nadditional sub-regions. A large proportion of the genera, however, when\r\nsufficiently numerous in species, range over almost the whole extent of\r\nthis sub-region wherever the conditions are favourable. Even the Andes do\r\nnot seem to form such a barrier as has been supposed. North of the equator,\r\nwhere its western slopes are moist and forest-clad, most of the genera are\r\nfound on both sides. To the south of this line its western valleys are arid\r\nand its lower plains almost deserts; and thus the absence of a {5}number of\r\ngroups to which verdant forests are essential, can be traced to the\r\nunsuitable conditions rather than to the existence of the mountain barrier.\r\nAll Tropical South America, therefore, is here considered to form but one\r\nsub-region.\r\n\r\nThe portion of North America that lies within the tropics, closely\r\nresembles the last sub-region in general zoological features. It possesses\r\nhardly any positive distinctions; but there are several of a negative\r\ncharacter, many important groups being wholly confined to South America. On\r\nthe other hand many genera range into Mexico and Guatemala from the north,\r\nwhich never reach South America; so that it is convenient to separate this\r\ndistrict as a sub-region, which forms, to some extent, a transition to the\r\nNearctic region.\r\n\r\n_General Zoological Features of the Neotropical Region._--Richness combined\r\nwith isolation is the predominant feature of Neotropical zoology, and no\r\nother region can approach it in the number of its peculiar family and\r\ngeneric types. It has eight families of Mammalia absolutely confined to it,\r\nbesides several others which are rare elsewhere. These consist of two\r\nfamilies of monkeys, Cebidæ and Hapalidæ, both abounding in genera and\r\nspecies; the Phyllostomidæ, or blood-sucking bats; Chinchillidæ and Caviidæ\r\namong rodents; besides the greater part of the Octodontidæ, Echimyidæ and\r\nCercolabidæ. Among edentata, it has Bradypodidæ, or sloths, Dasypodidæ, or\r\narmadillos, and Myrmecophagidæ, or anteaters, constituting nearly the\r\nentire order; while Procyonidæ, belonging to the carnivora, and\r\nDidelphyidæ, a family of marsupials, only extend into the Nearctic region.\r\nIt has also many peculiar groups of carnivora and of Muridæ, making a total\r\nof full a hundred genera confined to the region. Hardly less remarkable is\r\nthe absence of many wide-spread groups. With the exception of one genus in\r\nthe West Indian islands and a _Sorex_ which reaches Guatemala and Costa\r\nRica, the Insectivora are wholly wanting; as is also the extensive and\r\nwide-spread family of the Viverridæ. It has no oxen or sheep, and indeed no\r\nform of ruminant except deer and llamas; neither do its vast forests and\r\ngrassy plains support a single form of non-ruminant ungulate, except the\r\ntapir and the peccary.\r\n\r\n{6}_Birds._--In birds, the Neotropical region is even richer and more\r\nisolated. It possesses no less than 23 families wholly confined within its\r\nlimits, with 7 others which only extend into the Nearctic region. The names\r\nof the peculiar families are: Cærebidæ, or sugar-birds; Phytotomidæ, or\r\nplant-cutters; Pipridæ, or manakins; Cotingidæ, or chatterers;\r\nFormicariidæ, or ant-thrushes; Dendrocolaptidæ, or tree-creepers;\r\nPteroptochidæ; Rhamphastidæ, or toucans; Bucconidæ, or puff-birds;\r\nGalbulidæ, or jacamas; Todidæ, or todies; Momotidæ, or motmots;\r\nSteatornithidæ, the guacharo, or oil-bird; Cracidæ, or curassows; Tinamidæ,\r\nor tinamous; Opisthocomidæ, the hoazin; Thinocoridæ; Cariamidæ; Aramidæ;\r\nPsophiidæ, or trumpeters; Eurypygidæ, or sun-bitterns; and Palamedeidæ, or\r\nhorned-screamers. The seven which it possesses in common with North America\r\nare: Vireonidæ, or greenlets; Mniotiltidæ, or wood-warblers; Tanagridæ, or\r\ntanagers; Icteridæ, or hang-nests; Tyrannidæ, or tyrant-shrikes;\r\nTrochilidæ, or humming-birds; and Conuridæ, or macaws. Most of these\r\nfamilies abound in genera and species, and many are of immense extent; such\r\nas Trochilidæ, with 115 genera, and nearly 400 species; Tyrannidæ, with\r\nmore than 60 genera and nearly 300 species; Tanagridæ, with 43 genera and\r\n300 species; Dendrocolaptidæ with 43 genera and more than 200 species; and\r\nmany other very large groups. There are nearly 600 genera peculiar to the\r\nNeotropical region; but in using this number as a basis of comparison with\r\nother regions we must remember, that owing to several ornithologists having\r\nmade the birds of South America a special study, they have perhaps been\r\nmore minutely subdivided than in the case of other entire tropical regions.\r\n\r\n_Distinctive Characters of Neotropical Mammalia._--It is important also to\r\nconsider the kind and amount of difference between the various animal forms\r\nof this region and of the Old World. To begin with the Quadrumana, all the\r\nlarger American monkeys (Cebidæ) differ from every Old World group in the\r\npossession of an additional molar tooth in each jaw; and it is in this\r\ngroup alone that the tail is developed into a prehensile organ of wonderful\r\npower, adapting the animals to a purely arboreal life. Four of the genera,\r\ncomprising more than half the {7}species, have the prehensile tail, the\r\nremainder having this organ either short, or lax as in the Old World\r\nmonkeys. Other differences from Old World apes, are the possession of a\r\nbroad nasal septum, and a less opposable thumb; and the absence of\r\ncheek-pouches, ischial callosities, and a bony ear-tube. The Hapalidæ, or\r\nmarmozets, agree with the Cebidæ in all these characters, but have others\r\nin addition which still more widely separate them from the Simiidæ; such as\r\nan additional premolar tooth, acute claws, and thumb not at all opposable;\r\nso that the whole group of American monkeys are radically different from\r\nthe remainder of the order.\r\n\r\nThe Procyonidæ are a distinct family of Carnivora, which make up for the\r\nscarcity of Mustelidæ in South America. The Suidæ are represented by the\r\nvery distinct genus _Dicotyles_ (Peccary) forming a separate sub-family,\r\nand differing from all other genera in their dentition, the absence of tail\r\nand of one of the toes of the hind feet, the possession of a dorsal gland,\r\nand only two mammæ. The rodents are represented by the Chinchillidæ and\r\nCaviidæ, the latter comprising the largest animals in the order. The\r\nEdentata are almost wholly confined to this region; and the three families\r\nof the sloths (Bradypodidæ), armadillos (Dasypodidæ), and ant-eaters\r\n(Myrmecophagidæ), are widely separated in structure from any Old World\r\nanimals. Lastly, we have the opossums (Didelphyidæ), a family of\r\nmarsupials, but having no close affinity to any of the numerous Australian\r\nforms of that order. We have already arrived at the conclusion that the\r\npresence of marsupials in South America is not due to any direct\r\ntransference from Australia, but that their introduction is comparatively\r\nrecent, and that they came from the Old World by way of North America (vol.\r\ni., p. 155). But the numerous and deep-seated peculiarities of many other\r\nof its mammalia, would indicate a very remote origin; and a long-continued\r\nisolation of South America from the rest of the world is required, in order\r\nto account for the preservation and development of so many distinct groups\r\nof comparatively low-type quadrupeds.\r\n\r\n_Distinctive Characters of Neotropical Birds._--The birds which are\r\nespecially characteristic of this region, present similar distinctive\r\nfeatures. In the enormous group of Passerine {8}birds which, though\r\ncomprising nearly three-fourths of the entire class, yet presents hardly\r\nany well-marked differences of structure by which it can be subdivided--the\r\nfamilies confined to America are, for the most part, more closely related\r\nto each other than to the Old World groups. The ten families forming the\r\ngroup of \"Formicaroid Passeres,\" in our arrangement (vol. i., p. 94), are\r\ncharacterised by the absence of singing muscles in the larynx, and also by\r\nan unusual development of the first primary quill; and seven of this series\r\nof families (which are considered to be less perfectly developed than the\r\ngreat mass of Old World passeres) are exclusively American, the three\r\nbelonging to the Eastern hemisphere being of small extent. Another group of\r\nten families--our \"Tanagroid Passeres,\" are characterised by the abortion\r\nor very rudimentary condition of the first quill; and of these, five are\r\nexclusively American, and have numerous genera and species, while only two\r\nare non-American, and these are of small extent. On the other hand the\r\n\"Turdoid Passeres,\" consisting of 23 families and comprising all the true\r\n\"singing-birds,\" is poorly represented in America; no family being\r\nexclusively Neotropical, and only three being at all fully represented in\r\nSouth America, though they comprise the great mass of the Old World\r\npasseres. These peculiarities, which group together whole series of\r\nfamilies of American birds, point to early separation and long isolation,\r\nno less surely than the more remarkable structural divergences presented by\r\nthe Neotropical mammalia.\r\n\r\nIn the Picariæ, we have first, the toucans (Rhamphastidæ); an extraordinary\r\nand beautiful family, whose enormous gaily-coloured bills and long\r\nfeathered tongues, separate them widely from all other birds. The Galbulidæ\r\nor jacamars, the motmots (Momotidæ), and the curious little todies (Todidæ)\r\nof the Antilles, are also isolated groups. But most remarkable of all is\r\nthe wonderful family of the humming-birds, which ranges over all America\r\nfrom Tierra del Fuego to Sitka, and from the level plains of the Amazon to\r\nabove the snow-line on the Andes; which abounds both in genera, species,\r\nand individuals, and is yet strictly confined to this continent alone! How\r\nvast must have been the time required to develop those beautiful and\r\n{9}highly specialized forms out of some ancestral swift-like type; how\r\ncomplete and long continued the isolation of their birthplace to have\r\nallowed of their modification and adaptation to such divergent climates and\r\nconditions, yet never to have permitted them to establish themselves in the\r\nother continents. No naturalist can study in detail this single family of\r\nbirds, without being profoundly impressed with the vast antiquity of the\r\nSouth American continent, its long isolation from the rest of the land\r\nsurface of the globe, and the persistence through countless ages of all the\r\nconditions requisite for the development and increase of varied forms of\r\nanimal life.\r\n\r\nPassing on to the parrot tribe, we find the peculiar family of the\r\nConuridæ, of which the macaws are the highest development, very largely\r\nrepresented. It is in the gallinaceous birds however that we again meet\r\nwith wholly isolated groups. The Cracidæ, including the curassows and\r\nguans, have no immediate relations with any of the Old World families.\r\nProfessor Huxley considers them to approach nearest to (though still very\r\nremote from) the Australian megapodes; and here, as in the case of the\r\nmarsupials, we probably have divergent modifications of an ancient type\r\nonce widely distributed, not a direct communication between the southern\r\ncontinents. The Tinamidæ or tinamous, point to a still more remote\r\nantiquity, since their nearest allies are believed to be the Struthiones or\r\nostrich tribe, of which a few representatives are scattered widely over the\r\nglobe. The hoazin of Guiana (Opisthocomus) is another isolated form, not\r\nonly the type of a family, but perhaps of an extinct order of birds.\r\nPassing on to the waders, we have a number of peculiar family types, all\r\nindicative of antiquity and isolation. The _Cariama_ of the plains of\r\nBrazil, a bird somewhat intermediate between a bustard and a hawk, is one\r\nof these; the elegant _Psophia_ or trumpeter of the Amazonian forests; the\r\nbeautiful little sun-bittern of the river banks (_Eurypyga_); and the\r\nhorned screamers (_Palamedea_), all form distinct and isolated families of\r\nbirds, to which the Old World offers nothing directly comparable.\r\n\r\n_Reptiles._--The Neotropical region is very rich in varied forms of reptile\r\nlife, and the species are very abundant. It has six {10}altogether peculiar\r\nfamilies, and several others which only range into the Nearctic region, as\r\nwell as a very large number of peculiar or characteristic genera. As the\r\norders of reptiles differ considerably in their distributional features,\r\nthey must be considered separately.\r\n\r\nThe snakes (Ophidia) differ from all other reptiles, and from most other\r\norders of vertebrates, in the wide average distribution of the families; so\r\nthat such an isolated region as the Neotropical possesses no peculiar\r\nfamily, nor even one confined to the American continent. The families of\r\nmost restricted range are--the Scytalidæ, only found elsewhere in the\r\nPhilippine islands; the Amblycephalidæ, common to the Oriental and\r\nNeotropical regions; and the Tortricidæ, most abundant in the Oriental\r\nregion, but found also in the Austro-Malay islands and Tropical South\r\nAmerica. Sixteen of the families of snakes occur in the region, the\r\nColubridæ, Amblycephalidæ, and Pythonidæ, being those which are best\r\nrepresented by peculiar forms. There are 25 peculiar or characteristic\r\ngenera, the most important being _Dromicus_ (Colubridæ); _Boa_,\r\n_Epicrates_, and _Ungalia_ (Pythonidæ); _Elaps_ (Elapidæ); and\r\n_Craspedocephalus_ (Crotalidæ).\r\n\r\nThe lizards (Lacertilia) are generally more restricted in their range;\r\nhence we find that out of 15 families which inhabit the region, 5 are\r\naltogether peculiar, and 4 more extend only to N. America. The peculiar\r\nfamilies are Helodermidæ, Anadiadæ, Chirocolidæ, Iphisiadæ, and\r\nCercosauridæ; but it must be noted that these all possess but a single\r\ngenus each, and only two of them (Chirocolidæ and Cercosauridæ) have more\r\nthan a single species. The families which range over both South and North\r\nAmerica are Chirotidæ, Chalcidæ, Teidæ, and Iguanidæ; the first and second\r\nare of small extent, but the other two are very large groups, the Teidæ\r\npossessing 12 genera and near 80 species; the Iguanidæ 40 genera and near\r\n150 species; the greater part of which are Neotropical. There are more than\r\n50 peculiar or highly characteristic genera of lizards, about 40 of which\r\nbelong to the Teidæ and Iguanidæ, which thus especially characterize the\r\nregion. The most important and characteristic genera are the following;\r\n_Ameiva_ (Teidæ); _Gymnopthalmus_ (Gymnopthalmidæ); {11}_Celestus_ and\r\n_Diploglossus_ (Scincidæ); _Sphærodactylus_ (Geckotidæ); _Liocephalus_,\r\n_Liolæmus_, _Proctotretus_, and many smaller genera (Iguanidæ). The three\r\nextensive Old World families Varanidæ, Lacertidæ, and Agamidæ, are absent\r\nfrom the entire American continent.\r\n\r\nIn the order Crocodilia, America has the peculiar family of the alligators\r\n(Alligatoridæ), as well as several species of true crocodiles\r\n(Crocodilidæ). The Chelonia (tortoises) are represented by the families\r\nTestudinidæ and Chelydidæ, both of wide range; but there are six peculiar\r\ngenera,--_Dermatemys_ and _Staurotypus_ belonging to the former\r\nfamily,--_Peltocephalus_, _Podocnemis_, _Hydromedusa_, and _Chelys_, to the\r\nlatter. Some of the Amazon river-turtles of the genus _Podocnemys_ rival in\r\nsize the largest species of true marine turtles (Cheloniidæ), and are\r\nequally good for food.\r\n\r\n_Amphibia._--The Neotropical region possesses representatives of sixteen\r\nfamilies of Amphibia of which four are peculiar; all belonging to Anoura or\r\ntail-less Batrachians. The Cæciliadæ or snake-like amphibia, are\r\nrepresented by two peculiar genera, _Siphonopsis_ and _Rhinatrema_. Tailed\r\nBatrachians are almost unknown, only a few species of _Spelerpes_\r\n(Salamandridæ) entering Central America, and one extending as far south as\r\nthe Andes of Bogota in South America. Tail-less Batrachians on the other\r\nhand, are abundant; there being 14 families represented, of which\r\n4,--Rhinophryndæ, Hylaplesidæ, Plectromantidæ, and Pipidæ are peculiar.\r\nNone of these families contain more than a single genus, and only the\r\nsecond more than a single species; so that it is not these which give a\r\ncharacter to the South American Amphibia-fauna. The most important and best\r\nrepresented families are, Ranidæ (true frogs), with eleven genera and more\r\nthan 50 species; Polypedatidæ (tree-frogs) with seven genera and about 40\r\nspecies; Hylidæ (tree-frogs) with eight genera and nearly 30 species;\r\nEngystomidæ (toads) (5 genera), Bombinatoridæ (frogs), (4 genera),\r\nPhryniscidæ and Bufonidæ (toads), (each with 2 genera), are also fairly\r\nrepresented. All these families are widely distributed, but the Neotropical\r\ngenera are, in almost every case, peculiar.\r\n\r\n{12}_Fresh-water fishes._--The great rivers of Tropical America abound in\r\nfish of many strange forms and peculiar types. Three families, and three\r\nsub-family groups are peculiar, while the number of peculiar genera is\r\nabout 120. The peculiar families are Polycentridæ, with two genera;\r\nGymnotidæ, a family which includes the electric eels, (5 genera); and\r\nTrygonidæ, the rays, which are everywhere marine except in the great rivers\r\nof South America, where many species are found, belonging to two genera. Of\r\nthe extensive family Siluridæ, three sub-families Siluridæ anomalopteræ, S.\r\nolisthopteræ, and S. branchiolæ, are confined to this region. The larger\r\nand more important of the peculiar genera are the following: _Percilia_,\r\ninhabiting Chilian and _Percichthys_ South Temperate rivers, belong to the\r\nPerch family (Percidæ); _Acharnes_, found only in Guiana, belongs to the\r\nNandidæ, a family of wide range in the tropics; the Chromidæ, a family of\r\nexclusively fresh-water fishes found in the tropics of the Ethiopian,\r\nOriental and Neotropical regions, are here represented by 15 genera, the\r\nmore important being _Acara_ (17 sp.), _Heros_ (26 sp.), _Crenicichla_ (9\r\nsp.), _Satanoperca_ (7 sp.). Many of these fishes are beautifully marked\r\nand coloured. The Siluridæ proteropteræ are represented by 14 genera, of\r\nwhich _Pimelodus_ (42 sp.), and _Platystoma_ (11 sp.), are the most\r\nimportant; the Siluridæ stenobranchiæ by 11 genera, the chief being _Doras_\r\n(13 sp.), _Auchenipterus_ (9 sp.), and _Oxydoras_ (7 sp.). The Siluridæ\r\nproteropodes are represented by 16 genera, many of them being among the\r\nmost singular of fresh-water fishes, clothed in coats of mail, and armed\r\nwith hooks and serrated spines. The following are the most\r\nimportant,--_Chætostomus_ (25 sp.), _Loricaria_ (17 sp.), _Plecostonus_ (15\r\nsp.) and _Callichthys_ (11 sp.). The Characinidæ are divided between\r\nTropical America and Tropical Africa, the former possessing about 40 genera\r\nand 200 species. The Haplochitonidæ are confined to South America and\r\nAustralia; the American genus being _Haplochiton_. The Cyprinodontidæ are\r\nrepresented by 18 genera, the most important being, _Pæcilia_ (16 sp.),\r\n_Girardinus_ (10 sp.), and _Gambusia_ (8 sp.) The Osteoglossidæ, found in\r\nAustralian and African rivers, are represented in South America by the\r\npeculiar _Arapaima_, the \"pirarucu\" of the {13}Amazon. The ancient\r\nSirenoidei, also found in Australia and Africa, have the _Lepidosiren_ as\r\ntheir American representative. Lastly, _Ellipisurus_ is a genus of rays\r\npeculiar to the fresh waters of South America. We may expect these numbers\r\nto be largely increased and many new genera to be added, when the extensive\r\ncollections made by Agassiz in Brazil are described.\r\n\r\n_Summary of Neotropical Vertebrates._--Summarizing the preceding facts, we\r\nfind that the Neotropical region possesses no less than 45 families and\r\nmore than 900 genera of Vertebrata which are altogether peculiar to it;\r\nwhile it has representatives of 168 families out of a total of 330, showing\r\nthat 162 families are altogether absent. It has also representatives of 131\r\ngenera of Mammalia of which 103 are peculiar to it, a proportion of 4/5;\r\nwhile of 683 genera of land-birds no less than 576 are peculiar, being\r\nalmost exactly 5/6 of the whole. These numbers and proportions are far\r\nhigher than in the case of any other region.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Insects._\r\n\r\nThe Neotropical region is so excessively rich in insect life, it so abounds\r\nin peculiar groups, in forms of exquisite beauty, and in an endless\r\nprofusion of species, that no adequate idea of this branch of its fauna can\r\nbe conveyed by the mere enumeration of peculiar and characteristic groups,\r\nto which we are here compelled to limit ourselves. Our facts and figures\r\nwill, however, furnish data for comparison; and will thus enable those who\r\nhave some knowledge of the entomology of any other country, to form a\r\nbetter notion of the vast wealth of insect life in this region, than a more\r\ngeneral and picturesque description could afford them.\r\n\r\n_Lepidoptera._--The Butterflies of South America surpass those of all other\r\nregions in numbers, variety and beauty; and we find here, not only more\r\npeculiar genera and families than elsewhere, but, what is very remarkable,\r\na fuller representation of the whole series of families. Out of the 16\r\nfamilies of butterflies in all parts of the world, 13 are found here, and 3\r\nof these are wholly peculiar--Brassolidæ, Heliconidæ, and Eurygonidæ, with\r\na fourth, Erycinidæ, which only extends into the Nearctic {14}region; so\r\nthat there are 4 families peculiar to America. These four families comprise\r\n68 genera and more than 800 species; alone constituting a very important\r\nfeature in the entomology of the region. But in almost all the other\r\nfamilies there are numbers of peculiar genera, amounting in all to about\r\n200, or not far short of half the total number of genera in the\r\nworld--(431). We must briefly notice some of the peculiarities of the\r\nseveral families, as represented in this region. The Danaidæ consist of 15\r\ngenera, all peculiar, and differing widely from the generally sombre-tinted\r\nforms of the rest of the world. The delicate transparent-winged Ithomias of\r\nwhich 160 species are described, are the most remarkable. _Melinæa_,\r\n_Napeogenes_, _Ceratina_ and _Dircenna_ are more gaily coloured, and are\r\namong the chief ornaments of the forests. The Satyridæ are represented by\r\n25 peculiar genera, many of great beauty; the most remarkable and elegant\r\nbeing the genus _Hætera_ and its allies, whose transparent wings are\r\ndelicately marked with patches of orange, pink, or violet. The genus\r\n_Morpho_ is perhaps the grandest development of the butterfly type, being\r\nof immense size and adorned with the most brilliant azure tints, which in\r\nsome species attain a splendour of metallic lustre unsurpassed in nature.\r\nThe Brassolidæ are even larger, but are crepuscular insects, with rich\r\nthough sober colouring. The true Heliconii are magnificent insects, most\r\nelegantly marked with brilliant and strongly contrasted tints. The\r\nNymphalidæ are represented by such a variety of gorgeous insects that it is\r\ndifficult to select examples. Prominent are the genera _Catagramma_ and\r\n_Callithea_, whose exquisite colours and symmetrical markings are unique\r\nand indescribable; and these are in some cases rivalled by _Agrias_ and\r\n_Prepona_, which reproduce their style of coloration although not closely\r\nallied to them. The Erycinidæ, consisting of 59 genera and 560 species,\r\ncomprise the most varied and beautiful of small butterflies; and it would\r\nbe useless to attempt to indicate the unimaginable combinations of form and\r\ncolour they present. It must be sufficient to say that nothing elsewhere on\r\nthe globe at all resembles them. In Lycænidæ the world-wide genus _Thecla_\r\nis wonderfully developed, and the South {15}American species not only\r\nsurpass all others in size and beauty, but some of them are so gorgeous on\r\nthe under surface of their wings, as to exceed almost all the combinations\r\nof metallic tints we meet with in nature. The last family, Hesperidæ, is\r\nalso wonderfully developed here, the species being excessively numerous,\r\nwhile some of them redeem the character of this generally sober family, by\r\ntheir rich and elegant coloration.\r\n\r\nIn the only other group of Lepidoptera we can here notice, the Sphingina,\r\nthe Neotropical region possesses some peculiar forms. The magnificent\r\ndiurnal butterfly-like moths, _Urania_, are the most remarkable; and they\r\nare rendered more interesting by the occurrence of a species closely\r\nresembling them in Madagascar. Another family of day-flying moths, the\r\nCastniidæ, is almost equally divided between the Neotropical and Australian\r\nregions, although the genera are more numerous in the latter. The American\r\nCastnias are large, thick-bodied insects, with a coarse scaly surface and\r\nrich dull colours; differing widely from the glossy and gaily coloured\r\nAgaristas, which are typical of the family in the East.\r\n\r\n_Coleoptera._--This is so vast a subject that, as in the case of the\r\nregions already treated, we must confine our attention to a few of the more\r\nimportant and best known families as representatives of the entire order.\r\n\r\nCicindelidæ.--We find here examples of 15 out of the 35 genera of these\r\ninsects; and 10 of these genera are peculiar. The most important are\r\n_Oxychila_ (11 sp.), _Hiresia_ (14 sp.), and _Ctenostoma_ (26 sp.).\r\n_Odontochila_ (57 sp.) is the most abundant and characteristic of all, but\r\nis not wholly peculiar, there being a species in the Malay archipelago.\r\n_Tetracha_, another large genus, has species in Australia and a few in\r\nNorth America and Europe. The small genus _Peridexia_ is divided between\r\nBrazil and Madagascar,--a somewhat similar distribution to that of _Urania_\r\nnoticed above. One genus, _Agrius_, is confined to the southern extremity\r\nof the continent.\r\n\r\nCarabidæ.--Besides a considerable number of cosmopolitan or wide-spread\r\ngenera, this family is represented by more than 100 genera which are\r\npeculiar to the Neotropical region. The {16}most important of these are\r\n_Agra_ (150 sp.), _Ardistonus_ (44 sp.), _Schizogenius_ (25 sp.),\r\n_Pelecium_ (24 sp.), _Calophena_ (22 sp.), _Aspidoglossa_ (21 sp.), and\r\n_Lia_, _Camptodonotus_, _Stenocrepis_, and _Lachnophorus_, with each more\r\nthan 12 species. These are all tropical; but there are also a number of\r\ngenera (26) peculiar to Chili and South Temperate America. The most\r\nimportant of these are _Antarctia_ (29 sp,), all except two or three\r\nconfined to South Temperate America; _Scelodontis_ (10 sp.), mostly\r\nChilian; _Feronomorpha_ (6 sp.) all Chilian; and _Tropidopterus_ (4 sp.),\r\nall Chilian. _Helluomorpha_ (18 sp.), is confined to North and South\r\nAmerica; _Galerita_, _Callida_, and _Tetragonoderus_, are large genera\r\nwhich are chiefly South American but with a few species scattered over the\r\nother tropical regions, _Casnonia_ and _Lebia_ are cosmopolite, but most\r\nabundant in South America. _Pachyteles_ is mostly South American but with a\r\nfew species in West Africa; while _Lobodonotus_ has one species in South\r\nAmerica and two in Africa.\r\n\r\nLucanidæ.--The Neotropical species of this family almost all belong to\r\npeculiar genera. Those common to other regions are _Syndesus_, confined to\r\nTropical South America and Australia, and _Platycerus_ which is Palæarctic\r\nand Nearctic, with one species in Brazil. The most remarkable genus is\r\nundoubtedly _Chiasognathus_, confined to Chili. These are large insects of\r\nmetallic green colours, and armed with enormous serrated mandibles. The\r\nallied genera, _Pholidotus_ and _Sphenognathus_, inhabit Tropical South\r\nAmerica. _Streptocerus_ confined to Chili, is interesting, as being allied\r\nto the Australian _Lamprima_. The other genera present no remarkable\r\nfeatures; but _Sclerognathus_ and _Leptinoptera_ are the most extensive.\r\n\r\nCetoniidæ.--These magnificent insects are but poorly represented in\r\nAmerica; the species being mostly of sombre colours. There are 14 genera,\r\n12 of which are peculiar. The most extensive genus is _Gymnetis_, which,\r\nwith its allies _Cotinis_ and _Allorhina_, form a group which comprehends\r\ntwo-thirds of the Neotropical species of the family. The only other genera\r\nof importance are, _Inca_ (7 sp.), remarkable for their large size, and\r\nbeing the only American group in which horns are developed on the head;\r\n{17}and _Trigonopeltastes_ (6 sp.), allied to the European _Trichius_. The\r\nnon-peculiar genera are, _Stethodesma_, of which half the species are\r\nAfrican and half tropical American; and _Euphoria_, confined to America\r\nboth North and South.\r\n\r\nBuprestidæ.--In this fine group the Neotropical region is tolerably rich,\r\nhaving examples of 39 genera, 18 of which are peculiar to it. Of these, the\r\nmost extensive are _Conognatha_ and _Halecia_, which have a wide range over\r\nmost parts of the region; and _Dactylozodes_, confined to the south\r\ntemperate zone. Of important genera which range beyond the region,\r\n_Dicerca_ is mainly Nearctic and Palæarctic; _Cinyra_ has a species in\r\nNorth America and one in Australia; _Curis_ is divided between Chili and\r\nAustralia; the Australian genus _Stigmodera_ has a species in Chili;\r\n_Polycesta_ has a species in Madagascar, two in the Mediterranean region,\r\nand a few in North America; _Acherusia_ is divided between Australia and\r\nBrazil; _Ptosima_ has one species in south temperate America, the rest\r\nwidely scattered from North America to the Philippines; _Actenodes_ has a\r\nsingle species in North America and another in West Africa; _Colobogaster_\r\nhas two in West Africa, one in Java and one in the Moluccas. The relations\r\nof South America and Australia as indicated by these insects has already\r\nbeen sufficiently noticed under the latter region.\r\n\r\nLongicornia.--The Neotropical Longicorn Coleoptera are overwhelming in\r\ntheir numbers and variety, their singularity and their beauty. In the\r\nrecent Catalogue of Gemminger and Harold, it is credited with 516 genera,\r\n489 of which are peculiar to it; while it has only 5 genera in common\r\n(exclusively) with the Nearctic, and 4 (in the same way) with the\r\nAustralian region. Only the more important genera can be here referred to,\r\nunder the three great families into which these insects are divided.\r\n\r\nThe Prionidæ are excessively numerous, being grouped in 64 genera, more\r\nthan double the number possessed by any other region; and 61 of these are\r\npeculiar. The three, common to other regions, are, _Parandra_ and\r\n_Mallodon_, which are widely distributed; and _Ergates_, found also in\r\nCalifornia and Europe. The most remarkable genera are, the\r\nmagnificently-coloured _Psalidognathus_ and _Pyrodes_; the large and\r\nstrangely marked {18}_Macrodontia_; and _Titanus_, the largest insect of\r\nthe entire family.\r\n\r\nOf the Cerambycidæ there are 233 genera, exceeding by one-half, the number\r\nin any other region; and 225 of these are peculiar. Only 2 are common to\r\nthe Neotropical and Nearctic regions exclusively, and 3 to the Neotropical\r\nand Australian. The most extensive genera are the elegant _Ibidion_ (80\r\nsp.); the richly-coloured _Chrysoprasis_ (47 sp.); the prettily-marked\r\n_Trachyderes_ (53 sp.); with _Odontocera_ (25 sp.); _Criodon_ (22 sp.); and\r\na host of others of less extent, but often of surpassing interest and\r\nbeauty. The noteworthy genera of wide range are, _Oeme_ and _Cyrtomerus_,\r\nwhich have each a species in West Africa, and _Hammatocerus_, which has one\r\nin Australia.\r\n\r\nThe Lamiidæ have 219 genera, and this is the only tropical region in which\r\nthey do not exceed the Cerambycidæ. This number is almost exactly the same\r\nas that of the Oriental genera, but here there are more peculiar groups,\r\n203 against 160 in the other region. The most extensive genera are\r\n_Hemilophus_ (80 sp.), _Colobothea_ (70 sp.), _Acanthoderes_ (56 sp.),\r\n_Oncoderes_ (48 sp.), _Lepturgus_ (40 sp.), _Hypsioma_ (32 sp.), and\r\n_Tæniotes_ (20 sp.). _Macropus longimanus_, commonly called the harlequin\r\nbeetle, is one of the largest and most singularly-marked insects in the\r\nwhole family. _Leptostylus_ has a single species in New Zealand;\r\n_Acanthoderes_ has one species in Europe, W. Africa, and Australia,\r\nrespectively; _Spalacopsis_ has a species in W. Africa; _Pachypeza_ is\r\ncommon to S. America and the Philippines; _Mesosa_ is Oriental and\r\nPalæarctic, but has one species on the Amazon; _Apomecyna_ ranges through\r\nthe tropics of the Eastern Hemisphere, but has two species in S. America;\r\n_Acanthocinus_ has one species in Tasmania, and the rest in South America,\r\nNorth America, and Europe; _Phæa_ is wholly Neotropical, except two species\r\nin the Philippine Islands.\r\n\r\n_General Conclusions as to the Neotropical Insect-fauna._--Looking at the\r\ninsects of the Neotropical region as a whole, we are struck with the vast\r\namount of specialty they present; and, considering how many causes there\r\nare which must lead to the dispersal of insects, the number of its groups\r\nwhich are scattered {19}over the globe is not nearly so great as we might\r\nexpect. This points to a long period of isolation, during which the various\r\nforms of life have acted and reacted on each other, leading to such a\r\ncomplex yet harmoniously-balanced result as to defy the competition of the\r\nchance immigrants that from time to time must have arrived. This is quite\r\nin accordance with the very high antiquity we have shown most insect-forms\r\nto possess; and it is no doubt owing to this antiquity, that such a\r\ncomplete diversity of _generic_ forms has been here brought about, without\r\nany important deviation from the great _family_ types which prevail over\r\nthe rest of the globe.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Land Shells._--The Neotropical region is probably the richest on the globe\r\nin Terrestrial Mollusca, but this is owing, not to any extreme\r\nproductiveness of the equatorial parts of the continent, where almost all\r\nother forms of life are so largely developed, but to the altogether\r\nexceptional riches of the West India Islands. The most recent estimates\r\nshow that the Antilles contain more species of land shells than all the\r\nrest of the region, and almost exactly as many as all continental America,\r\nnorth and south.\r\n\r\nMr. Thomas Bland, who has long studied American land shells, points out a\r\nremarkable difference in the distribution of the Operculated and\r\nInoperculated groups, the former being predominant on the islands, the\r\nlatter on the continent. The Antilles possess over 600 species of\r\nOperculata, to about 150 on the whole American continent, the genera being\r\nas 22 to 14. Of Inoperculata the Antilles have 740, the Continent 1,250,\r\nthe genera being 18 and 22. The proportions of the two groups in each\r\ncountry are, therefore:\r\n\r\n               West India Islands.    American Continent.\r\n\r\n  Operculata     Gen. 22  Sp. 608         14    151\r\n  Inoperculata    \"   18   \"  737         22   1251\r\n\r\nThe extensive family of the Helicidæ is represented by 22 genera, of which\r\n6 are peculiar. _Spiraxis_ is confined to Central America and the Antilles;\r\n_Stenopus_ and _Sagda_ are Antillean only; _Orthalicus_, _Macroceramus_,\r\nand _Bulimulus_ have a wider range, the last two extending into the\r\nsouthern United {20}States. Important and characteristic genera are,\r\n_Glandina_, in all the tropical parts of the region; _Cylindrella_, in\r\nCentral America and the Antilles; _Bulimus_, containing many large and\r\nhandsome species in South America; _Stenogyra_, widely spread in the\r\ntropics; and _Streptaxis_, in Tropical South America.\r\n\r\nAmong the Operculata, the Aciculidæ are mostly Antillean, two genera being\r\npeculiar there, and one, _Truncatella_, of wide distribution, but most\r\nabundant in the West Indian Islands. The Cyclostomidæ are represented by 15\r\ngenera, 9 being peculiar to the region, and 5 of these (belonging to the\r\nsub-family Licinidæ) to the Antilles only. Of these peculiar genera\r\n_Cistula_ and _Chondropoma_ are the most important, ranging over all the\r\ntropical parts of the region. Other important genera are _Cyclotus_ and\r\n_Megalomastoma_; while _Cyclophorus_ also occurs all over the region. The\r\nHelicinidæ are mostly Neotropical, six out of the seven genera being found\r\nhere, and four are peculiar. _Stoastoma_, is one of the largest genera;\r\nand, with _Trochatella_ and _Alcadia_, is confined to the Antilles, while\r\nthe wide-spread _Helicina_ is most abundant there.\r\n\r\nThe Limacidæ, or Old World slugs, are absent from the region, their place\r\nbeing taken by the allied family, Oncidiadæ.\r\n\r\n_Marine Shells._--We go out of our usual course to say a few words about\r\nthe marine shells of this region, because their distribution on the two\r\nsides of the continent is important, as an indication of the former\r\nseparation of North and South America, and the connection of the Atlantic\r\nand Pacific Oceans. It was once thought that no species of shells were\r\ncommon to the two sides of the Central American Isthmus, and Dr. Mörch\r\nstill holds that opinion; but Dr. Philip Carpenter, who has paid special\r\nattention to the subject, considers that there are at least 35 species\r\nabsolutely identical, while as many others are so close that they may be\r\nonly varieties. Nearly 70 others are distinct but representative species.\r\nThe genera of marine mollusca are very largely common to the east and west\r\ncoasts, more than 40 being so named in the lists published by Mr. Woodward.\r\nThe West Indian Islands being a rich shell district, produce a number of\r\npeculiar forms, and the west coast of {21}South America is, to some extent,\r\npeopled by Oriental and Pacific genera of shells. On the west coast there\r\nis hardly any coral, while on the east it is abundant, showing a difference\r\nof physical conditions that must have greatly influenced the development of\r\nmollusca. When these various counteracting influences are taken into\r\nconsideration, the identity or close affinity of about 140 species and 40\r\ngenera on the two sides of the Isthmus of Panama becomes very important;\r\nand, combined with the fact of 48 species of fish (or 30 per cent. of those\r\nknown) being identical on the adjacent coasts of the two oceans (as\r\ndetermined by Dr. Günther), render it probable that Central America has\r\nbeen partially submerged up to comparatively recent geological times. Yet\r\nanother proof of this former union of two oceans is to be found in the\r\nfossil corals of the Antilles of the Miocene age, which Dr. Duncan finds to\r\nbe more allied to existing Pacific forms, than to those of the Atlantic or\r\neven of the Caribbean Sea.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEOTROPICAL SUB-REGIONS.\r\n\r\nIn the concluding part of this work devoted to geographical zoology, the\r\nsub-regions are arranged in the order best adapted to exhibit them in a\r\ntabular form, and to show the affinities of the several regions; but for\r\nour present purpose it will be best to take first in order that which is\r\nthe most important and most extensive, and which exhibits all the peculiar\r\ncharacteristics of the region in their fullest development. We begin\r\ntherefore with our second division.\r\n\r\n\r\n_II. Tropical South-America, or the Brazilian Sub-region._\r\n\r\nThis extensive district may be defined as consisting of all the tropical\r\nforest-region of South America, including all the open plains and pasture\r\nlands, surrounded by, or intimately associated with, the forests. Its\r\ncentral mass consists of the great forest-plain of the Amazons, extending\r\nfrom Paranaiba on the north coast of Brazil (long. 42° W.) to Zamora, in\r\nthe province of Loja (lat. 4° S., long. 79° W.), high up in the Andes, on\r\nthe west;--a distance in a straight line of more than 2,500 English miles,\r\n{22}along the whole of which there is (almost certainly) one continuous\r\nvirgin forest. Its greatest extent from north to south, is from the mouths\r\nof the Orinooko to the eastern slopes of the Andes near La Paz in Bolivia\r\nand a little north of Sta. Cruz de la Sierra (lat. 18° S.), a distance of\r\nabout 1,900 miles. Within this area of continuous forests, are included\r\nsome open \"campos,\" or patches of pasture lands, the most important\r\nbeing,--the Campos of the Upper Rio Branco on the northern boundary of\r\nBrazil; a tract in the interior of British Guiana; and another on the\r\nnorthern bank of the Amazon near its mouth, and extending some little\r\ndistance on its south bank at Santarem. On the northern bank of the\r\nOrinooko are the Llanos, or flat open plains, partly flooded in the rainy\r\nseason; but much of the interior of Venezuela appears to be forest country.\r\nThe forest again prevails from Panama to Maracaybo, and southwards in the\r\nMagdalena valley; and on all the western side of the Andes to about 100\r\nmiles south of Guayaquil. On the N.E. coast of Brazil is a tract of open\r\ncountry, in some parts of which (as near Ceara) rain does not fall for\r\nyears together; but south of Cape St. Roque the coast-forests of Brazil\r\ncommence, extending to lat. 30° S., clothing all the valleys and hill sides\r\nas far inland as the higher mountain ranges, and even penetrating up the\r\ngreat valleys far into the interior. To the south-west the forest country\r\nreappears in Paraguay, and extends in patches and partially wooded country,\r\ntill it almost reaches the southern extension of the Amazonian forests. The\r\ninterior of Brazil is thus in the position of a great island-plateau,\r\nrising out of, and surrounded by, a lowland region of ever-verdant forest.\r\nThe Brazilian sub-region comprises all this forest-country and its included\r\nopen tracts, and so far beyond it as there exists sufficient woody\r\nvegetation to support its peculiar forms of life. It thus extends\r\nconsiderably beyond the tropic in Paraguay and south Brazil; while the\r\ngreat desert of Chaco, extending from 25° to 30° S., lat. between the\r\nParana and the Andes, as well as the high plateaus of the Andean range,\r\nwith the strip of sandy desert on the Pacific coast as far as to about 5°\r\nof south latitude, belong to south temperate America, or the sub-region of\r\nthe Andes.\r\n\r\n{23}Having already given a sketch, of the zoological features of the\r\nNeotropical region as a whole, the greater part of which will apply to this\r\nsub-region, we must here confine ourselves to an indication of the more\r\nimportant groups which, on the one hand, are confined to it, and on the\r\nother are absent; together with a notice of its special relations to other\r\nregions.\r\n\r\n_Mammalia._--Many of the most remarkable of the American monkeys are\r\nlimited to this sub-region; as _Lagothrix_, _Pithecia_, and _Brachyurus_,\r\nlimited to the great Amazonian forests; _Eriodes_ to south-east Brazil; and\r\n_Callithrix_ to tropical South America. All the marmosets (Hapalidæ) are\r\nalso confined to this sub-region, one only being found at Panama, and\r\nperhaps extending a little beyond it. Among other peculiar forms, are 8\r\ngenera of bats; 3 peculiar forms of wild dog; _Pteronura_, a genus of\r\notters; _Inia_, a peculiar form of dolphin inhabiting the upper waters of\r\nthe Amazon; tapirs of the genus _Tapirus_ (a distinct genus being found\r\nnorth of Panama); 4 genera of Muridæ; _Ctenomys_, a genus of Octodontidæ;\r\nthe whole family of Echimyidæ, or spiny rats, (as far as the American\r\ncontinent is concerned) consisting of 8 genera and 28 species; _Chætomys_,\r\na genus of Cercolabidæ; the capybara (_Hydrochoerus_) the largest known\r\nrodent, belonging to the Caviidæ; the larger ant-eaters (_Myrmecophaga_);\r\nsloths of the genus _Bradypus_; 2 genera of armadillos (Dasypodidæ); and\r\ntwo peculiar forms of the opossum family (Didelphyidæ). No group that is\r\ntypically Neotropical is absent from this sub-region, except such as are\r\npeculiar to other single sub-regions and which will be noticed accordingly.\r\nThe occurrence of a solitary species of hare (_Lepus braziliensis_) in\r\ncentral Brazil and the Andes, is remarkable, as it is cut off from all its\r\nallies, the genus not being known to occur elsewhere on the continent\r\nfurther south than Costa Rica. The only important external relation\r\nindicated by the Mammalia of this sub-region is towards the Ethiopian\r\nregion, 2 genera of Echimyidæ, _Aulacodes_ and _Petromys_, occurring in\r\nSouth and South-east Africa.\r\n\r\n_Plate IV. Characteristic Neotropical Mammalia._--Our illustration\r\nrepresents a mountainous forest in Brazil, the part of South America where\r\nthe Neotropical Mammalia are perhaps best {24}developed. The central and\r\nmost conspicuous figure is the collared ant-eater, (_Tamandua\r\ntetradactyla_), one of the handsomest of the family, in its conspicuous\r\nlivery of black and white. To the left are a pair of sloths (_Arctopithecus\r\nflaccidus_) showing the curious black spot on the back with which many of\r\nthe species are marked, and which looks like a hole in the trunk of a tree;\r\nbut this mark seems to be only found on the male animal. The fur of many of\r\nthe sloths has a greenish tinge, and Dr. Seemann remarked its resemblance\r\nto the _Tillandsia usneoides_, or \"vegetable horsehair,\" which clothes many\r\nof the trees in Central America; and this probably conceals them from their\r\nenemies, the harpy-eagles. On the right are a pair of opossums (_Didelphys\r\nazaræ_), one of them swinging by its prehensile tail. Overhead in the\r\nforeground are a group of howling monkeys (_Mycetes ursinus_) the largest\r\nof the American Quadrumana, and the noisiest of monkeys. The large hollow\r\nvessel into which the hyoid bone is transformed, and which assists in\r\nproducing their tremendous howling, is altogether unique in the animal\r\nkingdom. Below them, in the distance, are a group of Sapajou monkeys\r\n(_Cebus_ sp.); while gaudy screaming macaws complete the picture of\r\nBrazilian forest life.\r\n\r\n_Birds._--A very large number of genera of birds, and some entire families,\r\nare confined to this sub-region, as will be seen by looking over the list\r\nof genera at the end of this chapter. We can here only notice the more\r\nimportant, and summarize the results. More than 120 genera of Passeres are\r\nthus limited, belonging to the following 12 families: Sylviidæ (1),\r\nTroglodytidæ (2), Coerebidæ (4), Tanagridæ (26), Fringillidæ (8), Icteridæ\r\n(5), Pteroptochidæ (3), Dendrocolaptidæ (12), Formicariidæ (16), Tyrannidæ\r\n(22), Cotingidæ (16), Pipridæ (10). Of the Picariæ there are 76 peculiar\r\ngenera belonging to 9 families, viz., Picidæ (2), Rhamphastidæ (1),\r\nCuculidæ (1), Bucconidæ (2), Galbulidæ (5), Momotidæ (2), Podargidæ (1),\r\nCaprimalgidæ (4), Trochilidæ (58). There are 3 peculiar genera of Psittaci,\r\n8 of Gallinæ, the only genus of Opisthocomidæ, 3 of Accipitres, 1 of\r\nRallidæ, _Psophia_ and _Eurypyga_ types of distinct families, and 1 genus\r\nof Ardeidæ, Palamedeidæ, and Anatidæ respectively. The preceding\r\nenumeration shows how very rich this sub-region is in peculiar types of all\r\nthe most characteristic American families, such as the Tanagridæ,\r\nTyrannidæ, Cotingidæ, Formicariidæ, Trochilidæ, and Galbulidæ. A\r\nconsiderable proportion of the genera of the Chilian and Mexican\r\nsub-regions also occur here, so that out of about 680 genera of Neotropical\r\nland-birds more than 500 are represented in this sub-region.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlate XIV.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nA BRAZILIAN FOREST, WITH CHARACTERISTIC MAMMALIA.\r\n\r\n{25}Without entering minutely into the distribution of species it is\r\ndifficult to sub-divide this extensive territory with any satisfactory\r\nresult.[1] The upland tract between the Amazon and Orinooko, which may be\r\ntermed Guiana, was evidently once an island, yet it possesses few marked\r\ndistinctive features. Brazil, which must have formed another great island,\r\nhas more speciality, but the intermediate Amazonian forests form a perfect\r\ntransition between them. The northern portion of the continent west of the\r\nOrinooko has more character; and there are indications that this has\r\nreceived many forms from Central and North America, and thus blended two\r\nfaunas once more distinct than they are now. The family of wood-warblers\r\n(Mniotiltidæ) seems to have belonged to this more northern fauna; for out\r\nof 18 genera only 5 extend south of the equator, while 6 range from Mexico\r\nor the Antilles into Columbia, some of these being only winter immigrants\r\nand no genus being exclusively South American. The eastern slopes of the\r\nAndes constitute, however, the richest and best marked province of this\r\nsub-region. At least 12 genera of tanagers (Tanagridæ) are found here only,\r\nwith an immense number of Fringillidæ,--the former confined to the forests;\r\nthe latter ranging to the upland plains. The ant-thrushes (Formicariidæ) on\r\nthe other hand seem more abundant in the lowlands, many genera being\r\npeculiar to the Amazonian forests. The superb chatterers (Cotingidæ) also\r\nseem to have their head-quarters in the forests of Brazil and Guiana, and\r\nto have thence spread {26}into the Amazonian valley. Guiana still boasts\r\nsuch remarkable forms as the cardinal chatterer (_Phoenicocercus_), the\r\nmilitary chatterer (_Hæmatoderus_), as well as _Querula_, _Gymnoderus_, and\r\n_Gymnocephalus_; but the first three pass to the south side of the Lower\r\nAmazon. Here also belong the cock of the rock (_Rupicola_), which ranges\r\nfrom Guiana to the Andes, and the marvellous umbrella-birds of the Rio\r\nNigro and Upper Amazon (_Cephalopterus_), which extends across the\r\nEcuadorean Andes and into Costa Rica. Brazil has _Ptilochloris_,\r\n_Casiornis_, _Tijuca_, _Phibalura_, and _Calyptura_; while not a single\r\ngenus of this family, except perhaps _Heliochæra_, is confined to the\r\nextensive range of the Andes. Almost the same phenomena are presented by\r\nthe allied Pipridæ or manakins, the greater part of the genera and species\r\noccurring in Eastern South America, that is in Brazil, Guiana, and the\r\nsurrounding lowlands rather than in the Andean valleys. The same may be\r\nsaid of the jacamars (Galbulidæ) and puff-birds (Bucconidæ); but the\r\nhumming-birds (Trochilidæ) have their greatest development in the Andean\r\ndistrict. Brazil and Guiana have each a peculiar genus of parrots; Guiana\r\nhas three peculiar genera of Cracidæ, while the Andes north of the equator\r\nhave two. The Tinamidæ on the other hand have their metropolis in Brazil,\r\nwhich has two or three peculiar genera, while two others seem confined to\r\nthe Andes south of the equator. The elegant trumpeters (Psophiidæ) are\r\nalmost restricted to the Amazonian valley.\r\n\r\nSomewhat similar facts occur among the Mammalia. At least 3 genera of\r\nmonkeys are confined to the great lowland equatorial forests and 1 to\r\nBrazil; _Icticyon_ (Canidæ) and _Pteronura_ (Mustelidæ) belong to Guiana\r\nand Brazil; and most of the Echimyidæ are found in the same districts. The\r\nsloths, ant-eaters, and armadillos all seem more characteristic of the\r\neastern districts than of the Andean; while the opossums are perhaps\r\nequally plentiful in the Andes.\r\n\r\nThe preceding facts of distribution lead us to conclude that the highlands\r\nof Brazil and of Guiana represent very ancient lands, dating back to a\r\nperiod long anterior to the elevation of the Andean range (which is by no\r\nmeans of great geological {27}antiquity) and perhaps even to the elevation\r\nof the continuous land which forms the base of the mountains. It was, no\r\ndoubt, during their slow elevation and the consequent loosening of the\r\nsurface, that the vast masses of debris were carried down which filled up\r\nthe sea separating the Andean chain from the great islands of Brazil and\r\nGuiana, and formed that enormous extent of fertile lowland forest, which\r\nhas created a great continent; given space for the free interaction of the\r\ndistinct faunas which here met together, and thus greatly assisted in the\r\nmarvellous development of animal and vegetable life, which no other\r\ncontinent can match. But this development, and the fusion of the various\r\nfaunas into one homogeneous assemblage must have been a work of time; and\r\nit is probable that most of the existing continent was dry land before the\r\nAndes had acquired their present altitude. The blending of the originally\r\ndistinct sub-faunas has been no doubt assisted by elevations and\r\ndepressions of the land or of the ocean, which have alternately diminished\r\nand increased the land-area. This would lead to a crowding together at one\r\ntime, and a dispersion at others, which would evidently afford opportunity\r\nfor many previously restricted forms to enter fresh areas and become\r\nadapted to new modes of life.\r\n\r\nFrom the preceding sketch it will appear, that the great sub-region of\r\nTropical South America as here defined, is really formed of three\r\noriginally distinct lands, fused together by the vast lowland Amazonian\r\nforests. In the class of birds sufficient materials exist for separating\r\nthese districts; and that of the Andes contains a larger series of peculiar\r\ngenera than either of the other sub-regions here adopted. But there are\r\nmany objections to making such a sub-division here. It is absolutely\r\nimpossible to define even approximate limits to these divisions--to say for\r\nexample where the \"Andes\" ends and where \"Brazil\" or \"Amazonia\" or \"Guiana\"\r\nbegins; and the unknown border lands separating these are so vast, that\r\nmany groups, now apparently limited in their distribution, may prove to\r\nhave a very much wider range. In mammalia, reptiles, and insects, it is\r\neven more difficult to maintain such divisions, so that on the whole it\r\nseems better to treat the entire area as one sub-region, {28}although\r\nrecognizing the fact of its zoological and geographical diversity, as well\r\nas its vast superiority over every other sub-region in the number and\r\nvariety of its animal forms.\r\n\r\nThe reptiles, fishes, mollusca, and insects of this sub-region have been\r\nsufficiently discussed in treating of the entire region, as by far the\r\nlarger proportion of them, except in the case of land-shells, are found\r\nhere.\r\n\r\n_Plate XV. Characteristic Neotropical Birds._--To illustrate the\r\nornithology of South America we place our scene on one of the tributaries\r\nof the Upper Amazon, a district where this class of animals is the most\r\nprominent zoological feature, and where a number of the most remarkable and\r\ninteresting birds are to be found. On the left we have the umbrella-bird\r\n(_Cephalopterus ornatus_), so called from its wonderful crest, which, when\r\nexpanded, completely overshadows its head like an umbrella. It is also\r\nadorned with a long tassel of plumes hanging from its breast, which is\r\nformed by a slender fleshy tube clothed with broad feathers. The bird is as\r\nlarge as a crow, of a glossy blue-black colour, and belongs to the same\r\nfamily as the exquisitely tinted blue-and-purple chatterers. Flying towards\r\nus are a pair of curl-crested toucans (_Pteroglossus beauharnaisii_),\r\ndistinguished among all other toucans by a crest composed of small black\r\nand shining barbless plumes, resembling curled whalebone. The general\r\nplumage is green above, yellow and red beneath, like many of its allies. To\r\nthe right are two of the exquisite little whiskered hummers, or\r\n\"frill-necked coquettes,\" as they are called by Mr. Gould, (_Lophornis\r\ngouldi_). These diminutive birds are adorned with green-tipped plumes\r\nspringing from each side of the throat, as well as with beautiful crests,\r\nand are among the most elegant of the great American family of\r\nhumming-birds, now numbering about 400 known species. Overhead are perched\r\na pair of curassows (_Crax globulosa_), which represent in America the\r\npheasants of the Old World. There are about a dozen species of these fine\r\nbirds, most of which are adorned with handsome curled crests. That figured,\r\nis distinguished by the yellow caruncular swellings at the base of the\r\nbill. The tall crane-like bird near the water is one of the trumpeters,\r\n(_Psophia leucoptera_), elegant birds with silky plumage peculiar to the\r\nAmazon valley. They are often kept in houses, where they get very tame and\r\naffectionate; and they are useful in catching flies and other house\r\ninsects, which they do with great perseverance and dexterity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlate XV.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nA FOREST SCENE ON THE UPPER AMAZON, WITH SOME CHARACTERISTIC BIRDS.\r\n\r\n\r\n{29}_Islands of Tropical South America._\r\n\r\nThese are few in number, and, with one exception, not of much interest.\r\nSuch islands as Trinidad and Sta. Catherina form parts of South America,\r\nand have no peculiar groups of animals. The small islands of Fernando\r\nNoronha, Trinidad, and Martin Vaz, off the coast of Brazil, are the only\r\nAtlantic islands somewhat remote from land; while the Galapagos Archipelago\r\nin the Pacific is the only group whose productions have been carefully\r\nexamined, or which present features of special interest.\r\n\r\n_Galapagos Islands._--These are situated on the equator, about 500 miles\r\nfrom the coast of Ecuador. They consist of the large Albemarle island, 70\r\nmiles long; four much smaller (18 to 25 miles long), named Narborough,\r\nJames, Indefatigable, and Chatham Islands; four smaller still (9 to 12\r\nmiles long), named Abingdon, Bindloes, Hood's, and Charles Islands. All are\r\nvolcanic, and consist of fields of black basaltic lava, with great numbers\r\nof extinct craters, a few which are still active. The islands vary in\r\nheight from 1,700 to 5,000 feet, and they all rise sufficiently high to\r\nenter the region of moist currents of air, so that while the lower parts\r\nare parched and excessively sterile, above 800 or 1,000 feet there is a\r\nbelt of comparatively green and fertile country.\r\n\r\nThese islands are known to support 58 species of Vertebrates,--1 quadruped,\r\n52 birds and 5 reptiles, the greater part of which are found nowhere else,\r\nwhile a considerable number belong to peculiar and very remarkable genera.\r\nWe must therefore notice them in some detail.\r\n\r\n_Mammalia._--This class is represented by a mouse belonging to the American\r\ngenus _Hesperomys_, but slightly different from any found on the continent.\r\nA true rat (_Mus_), slightly differing from any European species, also\r\noccurs; and as there can be little doubt that this is an escape from a\r\nship, somewhat {30}changed under its new conditions of life (the genus\r\n_Mus_ not being indigenous to the American continent), it is not\r\nimprobable, as Mr. Darwin remarks, that the American mouse may also have\r\nbeen imported by man, and have become similarly changed.\r\n\r\n_Birds._[2]--Recent researches in the islands have increased the number of\r\nland-birds to thirty-two, and of wading and aquatic birds to twenty-three.\r\nAll the land birds but two or three are peculiar to the islands, and\r\neighteen, or considerably more than half, belong to peculiar genera. Of the\r\nwaders 4 are peculiar, and of the swimmers 2. These are a rail (_Porzana\r\nspilonota_); two herons (_Butorides plumbea_ and _Nycticorax pauper_); a\r\nflamingo (_Phoenicopterus glyphorhynchus_); while the new aquatics are a\r\ngull (_Larus fuliginosus)_, and a penguin (_Spheniscus mendiculus_).\r\n\r\nThe land-birds are much more interesting. All except the birds of prey\r\nbelong to American genera which abound on the opposite coast or on that of\r\nChili a little further south, or to peculiar genera allied to South\r\nAmerican forms. The only _species_ not peculiar are, _Dolichonyx\r\noryzivorus_, a bird of very wide range in America and of migratory habits,\r\nwhich often visits the Bermudas 600 miles from North America,--and _Asio\r\naccipitrinus_, an owl which is found almost all over the world. The only\r\ngenera not exclusively American are _Buteo_ and _Strix_, of each of which a\r\npeculiar species occurs in the Galapagos, although very closely allied to\r\nSouth American species. There remain 10 genera, all either American or\r\npeculiar to the Galapagos; and on these we will remark in systematic order.\r\n\r\n1. _Mimus_, the group of American mocking-thrushes, is represented by three\r\ndistinct and well-marked species. 2. _Dendroeca_, an extensive and\r\nwide-spread genus of the wood-warblers (Mniotiltidæ), is represented by one\r\nspecies, which ranges over the greater part of the archipelago. The genus\r\nis especially abundant in Mexico, the Antilles, and the northern parts of\r\n{31}tropical America, only one species extending south as far as Chili. 3.\r\n_Certhidea_, a peculiar genus originally classed among the finches, but\r\nwhich Mr. Sclater, who has made South American birds his special study,\r\nconsiders to belong to the _Coerebidæ_, or sugar-birds, a family which is\r\nwholly tropical. Two species of this genus inhabit separate islands. 4.\r\n_Progne_, the American martins (Hirundinidæ), is represented by a peculiar\r\nspecies. 5. _Geospiza_, a peculiar genus of finches, of which no less than\r\neight species occur in the archipelago, but not more than four in any one\r\nisland. 6. _Camarhynchus_ (6 sp.) and 7. _Cactornis_ (4 sp.) are two other\r\npeculiar genera of finches; some of the species of which are confined to\r\nsingle islands, while others inhabit several. 8. _Pyrocephalus_, a genus of\r\nthe American family of tyrant-flycatchers (Tyrannidæ), has one peculiar\r\nspecies closely allied to _T. rubineus_, which has a wide range in South\r\nAmerica. 9. _Myiarchus_, another genus of the same family which does not\r\nrange further south than western Ecuador, has also a representative species\r\nfound in several of the islands. 10. _Zenaida_, an American genus of\r\npigeons, has a species in James Island and probably in some of the others,\r\nclosely allied to a species from the west coast of America.\r\n\r\nIt has been already stated that some of the islands possess peculiar\r\nspecies of birds distinct from the allied forms in other islands, but\r\nunfortunately our knowledge of the different islands is so unequal and of\r\nsome so imperfect, that we can form no useful generalizations as to the\r\ndistribution of birds among the islands themselves. The largest island is\r\nthe least known; only one bird being recorded from it, one of the\r\nmocking-thrushes found nowhere else. Combining the observations of Mr.\r\nDarwin with those of Dr. Habel and Prof. Sundevall, we have species\r\nrecorded as occurring in seven of the islands. Albemarle island has but one\r\ndefinitely known species; Chatham and Bindloe islands have 11 each;\r\nAbingdon and Charles islands 12 each; Indefatigable island and James island\r\nhave each 18 species. This shows that birds are very fairly distributed\r\nover all the islands, one of the smallest and most remote (Abingdon)\r\nfurnishing as many as the much larger Chatham Island, which is also the\r\nnearest {32}to the mainland. Taking the six islands which seem tolerably\r\nexplored, we find that two of the species (_Dendroeca aureola_ and\r\n_Geospiza fortis_) occur in all of them; two others (_Geospiza strenua_ and\r\n_Myiarchus magnirostris_) in five; four (_Mimus melanotis_, _Geospiza\r\nfuliginosa_, _G. parvula_, and _Camarhynchus prosthemelas_) in four\r\nislands; five (_Certhidea olivacea_, _Cactornis scandens_, _Pyrocephalus\r\nnanus_), and two of the birds of prey, in three islands; nine (_Certhidea\r\nfusca_, _Progne concolor_, _Geospiza nebulosa_, _G. magnirostris_,\r\n_Camarhynchus psittaculus_, _C. variegatus_, _C. habeli_ and _Asio\r\naccipitrinus_) in two islands; while the remaining ten species are confined\r\nto one island each. These peculiar species are distributed among the\r\nislands as follows. James, Charles and Abingdon islands, have 2 each;\r\nBindloes, Chatham, and Indefatigable, 1 each. The amount of speciality of\r\nJames Island is perhaps only apparent, owing to our ignorance of the fauna\r\nof the adjacent large Albemarle island; the most remote islands north and\r\nsouth, Abingdon and Charles, have no doubt in reality most peculiar\r\nspecies, as they appear to have. The scarcity of peculiar species in\r\nChatham Island is remarkable, it being large, very isolated, and the\r\nnearest to the mainland. There is still room for exploration in these\r\nislands, especially in Albemarle, Narborough, and Hood's islands of which\r\nwe know nothing.\r\n\r\n_Reptiles._--The few reptiles found in these islands are very interesting.\r\nThere are two snakes, a species of the American genus _Herpetodryas_, and\r\nanother which was at first thought to be a Chilian species (_Psammophis\r\nTemminckii_), but which is now considered to be distinct. Of lizards there\r\nare four at least, belonging to as many genera. One is a species of\r\n_Phyllodactylus_, a wide-spread genus of Geckotidæ; the rest belong to the\r\nAmerican family of the Iguanas, one being a species of the Neotropical\r\ngenus _Leiocephalus_, the other two very remarkable forms, _Trachycephalus_\r\nand _Oreocephalus_ (formerly united in the genus _Amblyrhynchus_). The\r\nfirst is a land, the second a marine, lizard; both are of large size and\r\nvery abundant on all the islands; and they are quite distinct from any of\r\nthe very numerous genera of Iguanidæ, spread all over the American\r\ncontinent. The last {33}reptile is a land tortoise (_Testudo nigra_) of\r\nimmense size, and also abundant in all the islands. Its nearest ally is the\r\nequally large species of the Mascarene Islands; an unusual development due,\r\nin both cases, to the absence of enemies permitting these slow but\r\ncontinually growing animals to attain an immense age. It is believed that\r\neach island has a distinct variety or species of tortoise.\r\n\r\n_Insects_.--Almost the only insects known from these islands are some\r\nColeoptera, chiefly collected by Mr. Darwin. They consist of a few peculiar\r\nspecies of American or wide-ranging genera, the most important being, a\r\n_Calosoma_, _Poecilus_, _Solenophorus_, and _Notaphus_, among the Carabidæ;\r\nan _Oryctes_ among the Lamellicornes; two new genera of obscure Heteromera;\r\ntwo Curculionidæ of wide-spread genera; a Longicorn of the South American\r\ngenus _Eburia_; and two small Phytophaga,--a set of species highly\r\nsuggestive of accidental immigrations at rare and distant intervals.\r\n\r\n_Land-Shells._--These consist of small and obscure species, forming two\r\npeculiar sub-genera of _Bulimulus_, a genus greatly developed on the whole\r\nWest coast of America; and a single species of _Buliminus_, a genus which\r\nranges over all the world except America. As in the case of the birds, most\r\nof the islands have two or three peculiar species.\r\n\r\n_General Conclusions._--These islands are wholly volcanic and surrounded by\r\nvery deep sea; and Mr. Darwin is of opinion, not only that the islands have\r\nnever been more nearly connected with the mainland than at present, but\r\nthat they have never been connected among themselves. They are situated on\r\nthe Equator, in a sea where gales and storms are almost unknown. The main\r\ncurrents are from the south-west, an extension of the Peruvian drift along\r\nthe west coast of South America. From their great extent, and their\r\nvolcanoes being now almost extinct, we may assume that they are of\r\nconsiderable antiquity. These facts exactly harmonize with the theory, that\r\nthey have been peopled by rare accidental immigrations at very remote\r\nintervals. The only peculiar _genera_ consist of birds and lizards, which\r\nmust therefore have been the earliest {34}immigrants. We know that small\r\nPasserine birds annually reach the Bermudas from America, and the Azores\r\nfrom Europe, the former travelling over 600, the latter over 1000 miles of\r\nocean. These groups of islands are both situated in stormy seas, and the\r\nimmigrants are so numerous that hardly any specific change in the resident\r\nbirds has taken place. The Galapagos receive no such annual visitants;\r\nhence, when by some rare accident a few individuals of a species did\r\narrive, they remained isolated, probably for thousands of generations, and\r\nbecame gradually modified through natural selection under completely new\r\nconditions of existence. Less rare and violent storms would suffice to\r\ncarry some of these to other islands, and thus the archipelago would in\r\ntime become stocked. It would appear probable, that those which have\r\nundergone most change were the earliest to arrive; so that we might look\r\nupon the three peculiar genera of finches, and _Certhidea_, the peculiar\r\nform of Coerebidæ, as among the most ancient inhabitants of the islands,\r\nsince they have become so modified as to have apparently no near allies on\r\nthe mainland. But other birds may have arrived nearly at the same time, and\r\nyet not have been much changed. A species of very wide range, already\r\nadapted to live under very varied conditions and to compete with varied\r\nforms of life, might not need to become modified so much as a bird of more\r\nrestricted range, and more specialized constitution. And if, before any\r\nconsiderable change had been effected, a second immigration of the same\r\nspecies occurred, crossing the breed would tend to bring back the original\r\ntype of form. While, therefore, we may be sure that birds like the finches,\r\nwhich are profoundly modified and adapted to the special conditions of the\r\nclimate and vegetation, are among the most ancient of the colonists; we\r\ncannot be sure that the less modified form of tyrant-flycatcher or\r\nmocking-thrush, or even the unchanged but cosmopolitan owl, were not of\r\ncoeval date; since even if the parent form on the continent has been\r\nchanged, successive immigrations may have communicated the same change to\r\nthe colonists.\r\n\r\nThe reptiles are somewhat more difficult to account for. We know, however,\r\nthat lizards have some means of dispersal over {35}the sea, because we find\r\nexisting species with an enormous range. The ancestors of the\r\n_Amblyrhynchi_ must have come as early, probably, as the earliest birds;\r\nand the same powers of dispersal have spread them over every island. The\r\ntwo American genera of lizards, and the tortoises, are perhaps later\r\nimmigrants. Latest of all were the snakes, which hardly differ from\r\ncontinental forms; but it is not at all improbable that these latter, as\r\nwell as the peculiar American mouse, have been early human importations.\r\nSnakes are continually found on board native canoes whose cabins are\r\nthatched with palm leaves; and a few centuries would probably suffice to\r\nproduce some modification of a species completely isolated, under\r\nconditions widely different from those of its native country. Land-shells,\r\nbeing so few and small, and almost all modifications of one type, are a\r\nclear indication of how rare are the conditions which lead to their\r\ndispersal over a wide extent of ocean; since two or three individuals,\r\narriving on two or three occasions only during the whole period of the\r\nexistence of the islands, would suffice to account for the present fauna.\r\nInsects have arrived much more frequently; and this is in accordance with\r\ntheir habits, their lower specific gravity, their power of flight, and\r\ntheir capacity for resisting for some time the effects of salt water.\r\n\r\nWe learn, then, from the fauna of these islands, some very important facts.\r\nWe are taught that tropical land-birds, unless blown out of their usual\r\ncourse by storms, rarely or never venture out to sea, or if they do so, can\r\nseldom pass safely over a distance of 500 miles. The immigrants to the\r\nGalapagos can hardly have averaged a bird in a thousand years. We learn,\r\nthat of all reptiles lizards alone have some tolerably effective mode of\r\ntransmission across the sea; and this is probably by means of currents, and\r\nin connection with floating vegetation. Yet their transmission is a far\r\nrarer event than that of land-birds; for, whereas three female immigrants\r\nwill account for the lizard population, at least eight or ten ancestors are\r\nrequired for the birds. Land serpents can pass over still more rarely, as\r\ntwo such transmissions would have sufficed to stock the islands with their\r\nsnakes; and it is not certain that either of these occurred without the aid\r\nof man. {36}It is doubtful whether mammals or batrachians have any means of\r\npassing, independently of man's assistance; the former having but one\r\ndoubtfully indigenous representative, the latter none at all. The\r\nremarkable absence of all gay or conspicuous flowers in these tropical\r\nislands, though possessing a zone of fairly luxuriant shrubby vegetation,\r\nand the dependence of this phenomenon on the extreme scarcity of insects,\r\nhas been already noticed at Vol. I. p. 461, when treating of a somewhat\r\nsimilar peculiarity of the New Zealand fauna and flora.\r\n\r\n\r\n_I. South Temperate America, or the Chilian Sub-region._\r\n\r\nThis sub-region may be generally defined as the temperate portion of South\r\nAmerica. On the south, it commences with the cold damp forests of Tierra\r\ndel Fuego, and their continuation up the west coast to Chiloe and northward\r\nto near Santiago. To the east we have the barren plains of Patagonia,\r\ngradually changing towards the north into the more fertile, but still\r\ntreeless, pampas of La Plata. Whether this sub-region should be continued\r\nacross the Rio de la Plata into Uruguay and Entre-rios, is somewhat\r\ndoubtful. To the west of the Parana it extends northward over the Chaco\r\ndesert, till we approach the border of the great forests near St. Cruz de\r\nla Sierra. On the plateau of the Andes, however, it must be continued still\r\nfurther north, along the \"paramos\" or alpine pastures, till we reach 5° of\r\nSouth latitude. Beyond this the Andes are very narrow, having no double\r\nrange with an intervening plateau; and although some of the peculiar forms\r\nof the temperate zone pass on to the equator or even beyond it, these are\r\nnot sufficiently numerous to warrant our extending the sub-region to\r\ninclude them. Along with the high Andes it seems necessary to include the\r\nwestern strip of arid country, which is mostly peopled by forms derived\r\nfrom Chili and the south temperate regions.\r\n\r\n_Mammalia._--This sub-region is well characterised by the possession of an\r\nentire family of mammalia having Neotropical affinities--the Chinchillidæ.\r\nIt consists of 3 genera--_Chinchilla_ (2 sp.), inhabiting the Andes of\r\nChili and Peru as far as 9° south latitude, and at from 8,000 to 12,000\r\nfeet altitude; _Lagidium_ (3 sp.), ranging over the Andes of Chili, Peru,\r\nand South Ecuador, {37}from 11,000 to 16,000 feet altitude; and\r\n_Lagostomus_ (1 sp.), the \"viscacha,\" confined to the pampas between the\r\nUruguay and Rio Negro. Many important genera are also confined to this\r\nsub-region. _Auchenia_ (4 sp.), including the domesticated llamas and\r\nalpacas, the vicugna which inhabits the Andes of Peru and Chili, and the\r\nguanaco which ranges over the plains of Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego.\r\nAlthough this genus is allied to the Old World camels, it is a very\r\ndistinct form, and its introduction from North America, where the family\r\nappear to have originated, may date back to a remote epoch. _Ursus\r\nornatus_, the \"spectacled bear\" of the Chilian Andes, is a remarkable form,\r\nsupposed to be most allied to the Malay bear, and probably forming a\r\ndistinct genus, which has been named _Tremarctos_. Four genera of\r\nOctodontidæ are also peculiar to this sub-region, or almost so;\r\n_Habrocomus_ (1 sp.) is Chilian; _Spalacopus_ (2 sp.) is found in Chili and\r\non the east side of the southern Andes; _Octodon_ (3 sp.) ranges from Chili\r\ninto Peru and Bolivia; _Ctenomys_ (6 sp.) from the Straits of Magellan to\r\nBolivia, with one species in South Brazil. _Dolichotis_, one of the Cavies,\r\nranges from Patagonia to Mendoza, and on the east coast to 37½° S.\r\nlatitude. _Myopotamus_ (1 sp.), the coypu (Echimyidæ), ranges from 33° to\r\n48° S. latitude on the west side of the Andes, and from the frontiers of\r\nPeru to 42° S. on the east side. _Reithrodon_ and _Acodon_, genera of\r\nMuridæ, are also confined to Temperate South America; _Tolypeutes_ and\r\n_Chlamydophorus_, two genera of armadillos, the latter very peculiar in its\r\norganization and sometimes placed in a distinct family, are found only in\r\nLa Plata and the highlands of Bolivia, and so belong to this sub-region.\r\n_Otaria_, one of the \"eared seals\" (Otariidæ), is confined to the coasts of\r\nthis sub-region and the antarctic islands. Deer of American groups extend\r\nas far as Chiloe on the west, and the Straits of Magellan on the east\r\ncoast. Mice of the South American genera _Hesperomys_ and _Reithrodon_, are\r\nabundant down to the Straits of Magellan and into Tierra del Fuego, Mr.\r\nDarwin having collected more than 20 distinct species. The following are\r\nthe genera of Mammalia which have been observed on the shores of the\r\nStraits of Magellan, those marked * extending into Tierra del Fuego:\r\n{38}*_Pseudalopex_ (two wolf-like foxes), _Felis_ (the puma), _Mephitis_\r\n(skunks), _Cervus_ (deer), *_Auchenia_ (guanaco), *_Ctenomys_ (tucu-tucu),\r\n*_Reithrodon_ and *_Hesperomys_ (American mice).\r\n\r\n_Birds._--Three families of Birds are confined to this\r\nsub-region,--Phytotomidæ (1 genus, 3 sp.), inhabiting Chili, La Plata, and\r\nBolivia; Chionididæ (1 genus, 2 sp.) the \"sheath-bills,\" found only at the\r\nsouthern extremity of the continent and in Kerguelen's Island, which with\r\nthe other antarctic lands perhaps comes best here; Thinocoridæ (2 genera, 6\r\nspecies) an isolated family of waders, ranging over the whole sub-region\r\nand extending northward to the equatorial Andes. Many genera are also\r\npeculiar: 3 of Fringillidæ, and 1 of Icteridæ; 9 of Dendrocolaptidæ, 6 of\r\nTyrannidæ, 3 of Trochilidæ, and 4 of Pteroptochidæ,--the last four South\r\nAmerican families. There is also a peculiar genus of parrots\r\n(_Henicognathus_) in Chili; two of pigeons (_Metriopelia_ and _Gymnopelia_)\r\nconfined to the Andes and west coast from Peru to Chili; two of Tinamous,\r\n_Tinamotes_ in the Andes, and _Calodromus_ in La Plata; three of\r\nCharadriidæ, _Phægornis_, _Pluvianellus_, and _Oreophilus_; and _Rhea_, the\r\nAmerican ostriches, inhabiting all Patagonia and the pampas. Perhaps the\r\nCariamidæ have almost as much right here as in the last sub-region,\r\ninhabiting as they do, the \"pampas\" of La Plata and the upland \"campos\" of\r\nBrazil; and even among the wide-ranging aquatic birds, we have a peculiar\r\ngenus, _Merganetta_, one of the duck family, which is confined to the\r\ntemperate plateau of the Andes.\r\n\r\nAgainst this extensive series of characteristic groups, all either of\r\nAmerican type or very distinct forms of Old World families, and therefore\r\nimplying great antiquity, we find, in mammalia and birds, very scanty\r\nevidence of that direct affinity with the north temperate zone, on which\r\nsome naturalists lay so much stress. We cannot point to a single\r\nterrestrial genus, which is characteristic of the north and reappears in\r\nthis south temperate region without also occurring over much of the\r\nintervening land. _Mustela_ seems only to have reached Peru; _Lepus_ is\r\nisolated in Brazil; true _Ursus_ does not pass south of Mexico. In birds,\r\nthe northern groups rarely go further south than Mexico or the Columbian\r\nAndes; and the only case of discontinuous {39}distribution we can find\r\nrecorded is that of the genus of ducks, _Camptolæmus_, which has a species\r\non the east side of North America and another in Chili and the Falkland\r\nIslands, but these, Professor Newton assures me, do not properly belong to\r\nthe same genus. Out of 30 genera of land-birds collected on the Rio Negro\r\nin Patagonia, by Mr. Hudson, only four extend beyond the American\r\ncontinent, and the same exclusively American character applies equally to\r\nits southern extremity. No list appears to have been yet published of the\r\nland-birds of the Straits of Magellan and Tierra del Fuego. The following\r\nis compiled from the observations of Mr. Darwin, the recent voyage of\r\nProfessor Cunningham, and other sources; and will be useful for comparison.\r\n\r\n  TURDIDÆ.\r\n     1.

It\r\nis a remarkable fact that so many of the species belong to genera which are\r\nwholly Neotropical, and that the specially South American families of\r\nIcteridæ, Tyrannidæ, Dendrocolaptidæ, Pteroptochidæ, Trochilidæ, and\r\nConuridæ, should supply more than one-third of the species; while the\r\npurely South American genus _Phrygilus_, should be represented by four\r\nspecies, three of which abound in Tierra del Fuego.\r\n\r\n_Plate XVI. A Scene in the Andes of Chili, with characteristic\r\nAnimals._--The fauna of South Temperate America being most fully developed\r\nin Chili, we place the scene of our illustration in that country. In the\r\nforeground we have a pair of the beautiful little chinchillas (_Chinchilla\r\nlanigera_), belonging to a family of animals peculiar to the sub-region.\r\nThere are only two species of this group, both confined to the higher\r\nAndes, at about 8000 feet elevation. Coming round a projecting ridge of the\r\nmountain, are a herd of vicunas (_Auchenia vicugna_), one of that peculiar\r\nform of the camel tribe found in South America and confined to its\r\ntemperate and alpine regions. The upper bird is a plant-cutter (_Phytotoma\r\nrara_), of sober plumage but allied to the beautiful chatterers, though\r\nforming a separate family. Below, standing on a rock, is a plover-like\r\nbird, the _Thinocorus orbignianus_, which is considered to belong to a\r\nseparate family, though allied to the plovers and sheath-bills. Its habits\r\nare, however, more those of the quails or partridges, living inland in dry\r\nand desert places, and feeding on plants, roots, and insects. Above is a\r\ncondor, the most characteristic bird of the high Andes.\r\n\r\n_Reptiles and Amphibia._--These groups show, for the most part, similar\r\nmodifications of American and Neotropical forms, as those we have seen to\r\nprevail among the birds. Snakes do not seem to go very far south, but\r\nseveral South American genera of Colubridæ and Dendrophidæ occur in Chili;\r\nwhile _Enophrys_ is peculiar to La Plata, and _Callorhinus_ to Patagonia,\r\nboth belonging to the Colubridæ. The Elapidæ do not extend into the\r\ntemperate zone; but _Craspedocephalus_, one of the Crotalidæ, occurs at\r\nBahia Blanca in Patagonia (Lat. 40° S.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlate XVI.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTHE CHILIAN ANDES, WITH CHARACTERISTIC ANIMALS.\r\n\r\n{41}Lizards are much more numerous, and there are several peculiar and\r\ninteresting forms. Three families are represented; Teidæ by two\r\ngenera--_Callopistes_ peculiar to Chili, and _Ameiva_ which ranges over\r\nalmost the whole American continent and is found in Patagonia; _Geckotidæ_\r\nby four genera, two of which,--_Caudiverbera_ and _Homonota_--are peculiar\r\nto Chili, while _Sphærodactylus_ and _Cubina_ are Neotropical, the former\r\nranging to Patagonia, the latter to Chili; and lastly the American family\r\nIguanidæ represented by eight genera, no less than six being peculiar, (or\r\nalmost so,) to the South temperate region. These are _Leiodera_,\r\n_Diplolæmus_ and _Proctrotretus_, ranging from Chili to Patagonia;\r\n_Leiolæmus_, from Peru to Patagonia; _Phrymaturus_, confined to Chili, and\r\n_Ptygoderus_ peculiar to Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego. The other two\r\ngenera, _Oplurus_ and _Leiosaurus_, are common to Chili and tropical South\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nTortoises appear to be scarce, a species of _Hydromedusa_ only being\r\nrecorded. Of the Amphibia, batrachia (frogs and toads) alone are\r\nrepresented, and appear to be tolerably abundant, seventeen species having\r\nbeen collected by Mr. Darwin in this sub-region. Species of the South\r\nAmerican genera _Phryniscus_, _Hylaplesia_, _Telmatobius_, _Cacotus_,\r\n_Hylodes_, _Cyclorhamphus_, _Pleurodema_, _Cystignathus_, and _Leiuperus_,\r\nare found in various localities, some extending even to the Straits of\r\nMagellan,---the extreme southern limit of both Reptilia and Amphibia,\r\nexcept one lizard (_Ptygoderus_) found by Professor Cunningham in Tierra\r\ndel Fuego. There are also four peculiar genera, _Rhinoderma_ belonging to\r\nthe Engystomidæ; _Alsodes_ and _Nannophryne_ to the Bombinatoridæ;\r\n_Opisthodelphys_ to the Hylidæ; and _Calyptocephalus_ to the Discoglossidæ.\r\n\r\nIt thus appears, that in the Reptiles all the groups are typically\r\nAmerican, and that most of the peculiar genera belong to families which are\r\nexclusively American. The Amphibia, on the other hand, present some\r\ninteresting external relations, but these are as much with Australia as\r\nwith the North temperate regions. The Bombinatoridæ are indeed Palæarctic,\r\nbut a larger proportion are Neotropical, and one genus inhabits New\r\nZealand. The Chilian genus _Calyptocephalus_ is allied to Australian\r\ntropical genera. {42}The Neotropical genera of Ranidæ, five of which extend\r\nto Chili and Patagonia, belong to a division which is Australian and\r\nNeotropical, and which has species in the Oriental and Ethiopian regions.\r\n\r\n_Fresh-water Fishes._--These present some peculiar forms, and some very\r\ninteresting phenomena of distribution. The genus _Percilia_ has been found\r\nonly in the Rio de Maypu in Chili; and _Percichthys_, also belonging to the\r\nperch family, has five species confined to the fresh waters of South\r\nTemperate America, and one far away in Java. _Nematogenys_ (1 sp.) is\r\npeculiar to Chili; _Trichomycterus_ reaches 15,000 feet elevation in the\r\nAndes,--both belonging to the Siluridæ; _Chirodon_ (2 sp.), belonging to\r\nthe Characinidæ, is peculiar to Chili; and several other genera of the same\r\nfamily extend into this sub-region from Brazil. The family _Haplochitonidæ_\r\nhas a remarkable distribution; one of its genera, Haplochiton (2 sp.),\r\ninhabiting Tierra del Fuego and the Falkland Islands, while the other,\r\n_Prototroctes_, is found only in South Australia and New Zealand. Still\r\nmore remarkable is _Galaxias_ (forming the family Galaxidæ), the species of\r\nwhich are divided between Temperate South America, and Australia, Tasmania,\r\nand New Zealand; and there is even one species (_Galaxias attenuatus_)\r\nwhich is found in the Chatham Islands, New Zealand, and Tasmania, as well\r\nas in the Falkland Islands and Patagonia. _Fitzroya_ (1 sp.) is found only\r\nat Montevideo; _Orestias_ (6 sp.) is peculiar to Lake Titicaca in the high\r\nAndes of Bolivia; _Jenynsia_ (1 sp.) in the Rio de la Plata--all belonging\r\nto the characteristic South American family of the Cyprinodontidæ.\r\n\r\n_Insects._--It is in insects more than in any other class of animals, that\r\nwe find clear indications of a not very remote migration of northern forms,\r\nalong the great mountain range to South Temperate America, where they have\r\nestablished themselves as a prominent feature in the entomology of the\r\ncountry. The several orders and families, however, differ greatly in this\r\nrespect; and there are some groups which are only represented by\r\nmodifications of tropical forms, as we have seen to be almost entirely the\r\ncase in birds and reptiles.\r\n\r\n{43}_Lepidoptera._--The butterflies of the South Temperate Sub-region are\r\nnot numerous, only about 29 genera and 80 species being recorded. Most of\r\nthese are from Chili, which is sufficiently accounted for by the general\r\nabsence of wood on the east side of the Andes from Buenos Ayres to South\r\nPatagonia. The families represented are as follows: Satyridæ, with 11\r\ngenera and 27 species, are the most abundant; Nymphalidæ, 2 genera and 8\r\nspecies; Lemoniidæ, 1 genus, 1 species; Lycænidæ, 3 genera, 8 species;\r\nPieridæ, 6 genera, 14 species; Papilionidæ, 2 genera, 8 species; Hesperidæ,\r\n4 genera, 13 species. One genus of Satyridæ (_Elina_) and 2 of Pieridæ\r\n(_Eroessa_ and _Phulia_) are peculiar to Chili. The following are the\r\ngenera whose derivation must be traced to the north temperate\r\nzone:--_Tetraphlybia_, _Neosatyrus_, and 3 allied genera of 1 species each,\r\nwere formerly included under _Erebia_, a northern and arctic form, yet\r\nhaving a few species in South Africa; _Argyrophorus_, allied to _Æneis_, a\r\nnorthern genus; _Hipparchia_, a northern genus yet having a species in\r\nBrazil;--all Satyridæ. The Nymphalidæ are represented by the typical north\r\ntemperate genus _Argynnis_, with 7 species in Chili; _Colias_, among the\r\nPieridæ, is usually considered to be a northern genus, but it possesses\r\nrepresentatives in South Africa, the Sandwich Islands, Malabar, New\r\nGrenada, and Peru, as well as Chili, and must rather be classed as\r\ncosmopolitan. These form a sufficiently remarkable group of northern forms,\r\nbut they are accompanied by others of a wholly Neotropical origin. Such are\r\n_Stibomorpha_ with 6 species, ranging through South America to Guatemala,\r\nand _Eteona_, common to Chili and Brazil (Satyridæ); _Apodemia_ (Lemoniidæ)\r\nconfined to Tropical America and Chili. _Hesperocharis_ and _Callidryas_\r\n(Pieridæ), both tropical; and _Thracides_ (Hesperidæ) confined to Tropical\r\nAmerica and Chili. Other genera are widely scattered; as, _Epinephile_\r\nfound also in Mexico and Australia; _Cupido_, widely spread in the tropics;\r\n_Euryades_, found only in La Plata and Paraguay, allied to South American\r\nforms of _Papilio_, to the Australian _Eurycus_, and the northern\r\n_Parnassius_; and _Heteropterus_, scattered in Chili, North America, and\r\nTropical Africa. We find then, among butterflies, a large north-temperate\r\nelement, {44}intermingled in nearly equal proportions with forms derived\r\nfrom Tropical America; and the varying degrees of resemblances of the\r\nChilian to the northern species, seems to indicate successive immigrations\r\nat remote intervals.\r\n\r\n_Coleoptera._--It is among the beetles of South Temperate America that we\r\nfind some of the most curious examples of remote affinities, and traces of\r\nancient migrations. The Carabidæ are very well represented, and having been\r\nmore extensively collected than most other families, offer us perhaps the\r\nmost complete materials. Including the Cicindelidæ, about 50 genera are\r\nknown from the South Temperate Sub-region, the greater part from Chili, but\r\na good number also from Patagonia and the Straits of Magellan. Of these\r\nmore than 30 are peculiar, and most of them are so isolated that it is\r\nimpossible to determine with precision their nearest allies.\r\n\r\nThe only remarkable form of Cicindelidæ is _Agrius_, a genus allied to the\r\n_Amblycheila_ and _Omus_ of N.W. America. Two genera of Carabidæ,\r\n_Cascellius_ and _Baripus_, are closely allied to _Promecoderus_, an\r\nAustralian genus; and another, _Lecanomerus_, has one species in Chili and\r\nthe other in Australia. Five or six of the peculiar genera are undoubtedly\r\nallied to characteristic Palæarctic forms; and such northern genera as\r\n_Carabus_, _Pristonychus_, _Anchomenus_, _Pterostichus_, _Percus_,\r\n_Bradycellus_, _Trechus_, and _Bembidium_, all absent from Tropical\r\nAmerica, give great support to the view that there is a close relation\r\nbetween the insects of the northern regions and South Temperate America. A\r\ndecided tropical element is, however, present. _Tropopterus_ is near\r\n_Colpodes_, a Tropical and South American genus; _Mimodromius_ and\r\n_Plagiotelium_ are near _Calleida_, a South American genus; while\r\n_Pachyteles_, _Pericompsus_, _Variopalpus_, and _Calleida_ are widely\r\nspread American groups. The preponderance of northern forms seems, however,\r\nto be undoubted.\r\n\r\nSix Carabidæ are known from Juan Fernandez, 3 being identical with Chilian\r\nspecies and 3 peculiar. As the island is 350 miles from the mainland, we\r\nhave here a proof of how readily insects may be transported great\r\ndistances.\r\n\r\n{45}The Palæarctic affinity of the South Temperate Carabidæ may be readily\r\nunderstood, if we bear in mind the great antiquity of the group, and the\r\nknown long persistence of generic and specific forms of Coleoptera; the\r\nfacility with which they may be transported to great distances by gales and\r\nhurricanes, either on land or over the sea; and, therefore, the probability\r\nthat suitable stations would be rapidly occupied by species already adapted\r\nto them, to the exclusion of those of the adjacent tracts which had been\r\nspecialised under different conditions. If, for example, we carry ourselves\r\nback to the time when the Andes had only risen to half their present\r\naltitude, and Patagonia had not emerged from the ocean (an epoch not very\r\nremote geologically), we should find nearly all the Carabidæ of South\r\nAmerica, adapted to a warm, and probably forest-covered country. If, then,\r\na further considerable elevation of the land took place, a large temperate\r\nand cold area would be formed, without any suitable insect inhabitants.\r\nDuring the necessarily slow process of elevation, many of the tropical\r\nCarabidæ would spread upwards, and some would become adapted to the new\r\nconditions; while the majority would probably only maintain themselves by\r\ncontinued fresh immigrations. But, as the mountains rose, another set of\r\norganisms would make their way along the highest ridges. The abundance and\r\nvariety of the North Temperate Carabidæ, and their complete adaptation to a\r\nlife on barren plains and rock-strewn mountains, would enable them rapidly\r\nto extend into any newly-raised land suitable to them; and thus the whole\r\nrange of the Rocky Mountains and Andes would obtain a population of\r\nnorthern forms, which would overflow into Patagonia, and there, finding no\r\ncompetitors, would develope into a variety of modified groups. This\r\nmigration was no doubt effected mainly, during successive glacial epochs,\r\nwhen the mountain-range of the Isthmus of Panama, if moderately increased\r\nin height, might become adapted for the passage of northern forms, while\r\nstorms would often carry insects from peak to peak over intervening forest\r\nlowlands or narrow straits of sea. If this is the true explanation, we\r\nought to find no such preponderant northern element in groups which {46}are\r\nproportionally less developed in cold and temperate climates. Our further\r\nexamination will show how far this is the case.\r\n\r\nLucanidæ.--Only four genera are known in the sub-region. Two are peculiar,\r\n_Chiasognathus_ and _Streptocerus_, the former allied to Tropical American,\r\nthe latter to Australian genera; the other two genera are exclusively South\r\nAmerican.\r\n\r\nCetoniidæ.--These seem very scarce, only a few species of the Neotropical\r\ngenus _Gymnetis_ reaching Patagonia.\r\n\r\nBuprestidæ.--These are rather numerous, many very beautiful species being\r\nfound in Chili. Nineteen genera are represented in South Temperate America,\r\nand 5 of these are peculiar to it; 3 others are South American genera; 2\r\nare Australian, and the remainder are wide-spread, but all are found also\r\nin Tropical America. The only north-temperate genus is _Dicerca_, and even\r\nthis occurs also in the Antilles, Brazil, and Peru. Of the peculiar genera,\r\nthe largest, _Dactylozodes_ (26 sp.), has one species in South Brazil, and\r\nis closely allied to _Hyperantha_, a genus of Tropical America;\r\n_Epistomentis_ is allied to _Nascis_, an Australian genus; _Tyndaris_ is\r\nclose to _Acmoeodera_, a genus of wide range and preferring desert or dry\r\ncountries. The other two are single species of cosmopolitan affinities. On\r\nthe whole, therefore, the Buprestidæ are unmistakeably Neotropical in\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nLongicorns.--Almost the whole of the South Temperate Longicorns inhabit\r\nChili, which is very rich in this beautiful tribe. About 75 genera and 160\r\nspecies are known, and nearly half of the genera are peculiar. Many of the\r\nspecies are large and handsome, rivalling in beauty those of the most\r\nfavoured tropical lands. Of the 8 genera of Prionidæ 6 are peculiar, but\r\nall are allied to Tropical American forms except _Microplophorus_, which\r\nbelongs to a group of genera spread over Australia, Europe, and Mexico. The\r\nCerambycidæ are much more abundant, and their affinities more interesting.\r\nTwo (_Syllitus_ and _Pseudocephalus_) are common to Australia and Chili.\r\nTwenty-three are Neotropical; and among these _Ibidion_, _Compsocerus_,\r\n_Callideriphus_, _Trachyderes_, and _Xylocharis_, are best represented.\r\nTwenty are {47}altogether peculiar, but most of them are more or less\r\nclosely allied to genera inhabiting Tropical America. Some, as the handsome\r\n_Cheloderus_ and _Oxypeltus_, have no close allies in any part of the\r\nworld. _Holopterus_, though very peculiar, shows most resemblance to a New\r\nZealand insect. _Sibylla_, _Adalbus_, and _Phantagoderus_, have Australian\r\naffinities; while _Calydon_ alone shows an affinity for north-temperate\r\nforms. One species of the northern genus, _Leptura_, is said to have been\r\nfound at Buenos Ayres.\r\n\r\nThe Lamiidæ are less abundant. Nine of the genera are Neotropical. Two\r\n(_Apomecyna_ and _Exocentrus_) are spread over all tropical regions. Ten\r\ngenera are peculiar; and most of these are related to Neotropical groups or\r\nare of doubtful affinities. Only one, _Aconopterus_, is decidedly allied to\r\na northern genus, _Pogonochærus_. It thus appears, that none of the Lamiidæ\r\nexhibit Australian affinities, although these are a prominent feature in\r\nthe relations of the Cerambycidæ.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is evident, from the foregoing outline, that the insects of South\r\nTemperate America, more than any other class of animals, exhibit a\r\nconnection with the north temperate regions, yet this connection is only\r\nseen in certain groups. In Diurnal Lepidoptera and in Carabidæ, the\r\nnorthern element is fully equal to the tropical, or even preponderates over\r\nit. We have already suggested an explanation of this fact in the case of\r\nthe Carabidæ, and with the butterflies it is not more difficult. The great\r\nmass of Neotropical butterflies are forest species, and have been developed\r\nfor countless ages in a forest-clad tropical country. The north temperate\r\nbutterflies, on the other hand, are very largely open-country species,\r\nfrequenting pastures, mountains, and open plains, and often wandering over\r\nan extensive area. These would find, on the higher slopes of mountains, a\r\nvegetation and conditions suited to them, and would occupy such stations in\r\nless time than would be required to adapt and modify the forest-haunting\r\ngroups of the American lowlands. In those groups of insects, however, in\r\nwhich the conditions of life are nearly the same as regards both temperate\r\nand tropical species, the superior {48}number and variety of the tropical\r\nforms has given them the advantage. Thus we find that among the Lucanidæ,\r\nBuprestidæ, and Longicorns, the northern element is hardly perceptible.\r\nMost of these are either purely Neotropical, or allied to Neotropical\r\ngenera, with the admixture, however, of a decided Australian element. As in\r\nthe case of the Amphibia and fresh-water fishes, the Australian affinity,\r\nas shown by insects, is of two kinds, near and remote. We have a few genera\r\ncommon to the two countries; but more commonly the genera are very\r\ndistinct, and the affinity is shown by the genera of both countries\r\nbelonging to a group peculiar to them, but which may be of very great age.\r\nIn the former case, we must impute some of the resemblance of the two\r\nfaunas to an actual interchange of forms within the epoch of existing\r\ngenera--a period of vast and unknown duration in the class of insects;\r\nwhile in the latter case, and perhaps also in many of the former, it seems\r\nmore in accordance with the whole of the phenomena, to look upon most of\r\nthe instances as survivals, in the two southern temperate areas, of the\r\nrelics of groups which had once a much wider distribution. That this is the\r\ntrue explanation, is suggested by the numerous cases of discontinuous and\r\nscattered distribution we have had to notice, in which every part of the\r\nglobe, without exception, is implicated; and there is a reason why these\r\nsurvivals should be rather more frequent in Australia and temperate South\r\nAmerica, inasmuch as these two areas agree in the absence of a considerable\r\nnumber of otherwise cosmopolitan vertebrate types, and are also in many\r\nrespects very similar in climatic and other physical conditions. The\r\npreponderating influence of the organic over the physical environment, as\r\ntaught by Mr. Darwin, leads us to give most weight to the first of the\r\nabove-mentioned causes; to which we may also impute such undoubted cases of\r\nsurvival of ancient types as the Centetidæ of the Antilles and\r\nMadagascar--both areas strikingly deficient in the higher vertebrate forms.\r\nThe probable mode and time of the cross migration between Australia and\r\nSouth America, has been sufficiently discussed in our chapter on the\r\nAustralian region, when treating of the origin and affinities of the New\r\nZealand fauna.\r\n\r\n\r\n{49}_Islands of the South Temperate Sub-region._\r\n\r\nThese are few, and of not much zoological interest. Tierra del Fuego,\r\nalthough really an island, is divided from the mainland by so narrow a\r\nchannel that it may be considered as forming part of the continent. The\r\nguanaco (_Auchenia huanaco_) ranges over it, and even to small islands\r\nfurther south.\r\n\r\n_The Falkland Islands._--These are more important, being situated about 350\r\nmiles to the east of Southern Patagonia; but the intervening sea is\r\nshallow, the 100 fathom line of soundings passing outside the islands. We\r\nhave therefore reason to believe that they have been connected with South\r\nAmerica at a not distant epoch; and in agreement with this view we find\r\nmost of their productions identical, while the few that are peculiar are\r\nclosely allied to the forms of the mainland.\r\n\r\nThe only indigenous Mammals are a wolf-like fox (_Pseudalopex antarcticus_)\r\nsaid to be found nowhere else, but allied to two other species inhabiting\r\nSouthern Patagonia; and a species of mouse, probably one of the American\r\ngenera _Hesperomys_ or _Reithrodon_.\r\n\r\nSixty-seven species of Birds have been obtained in these islands, but only\r\n18 are land-birds; and even of these 7 are birds of prey, leaving only 11\r\nPasseres. The former are all common South American forms, but one species,\r\n_Milvago australis_, seems peculiar. The 11 Passeres belong to 9 genera,\r\nall found on the adjacent mainland. Three, or perhaps four, of the species\r\nare however peculiar. These are _Phrygilus melanoderus_, _P.\r\nxanthogrammus_, _Cinclodes antarcticus_, and _Muscisaxicola macloviana_.\r\nThe wading and swimming birds are of little interest, except the penguins,\r\nwhich are greatly developed; no less than eight species being found, five\r\nas residents and three as accidental visitors.\r\n\r\nNo reptiles are known to inhabit these islands.\r\n\r\n_Juan Fernandez._--This island is situated in the Pacific Ocean, about 400\r\nmiles west of Valparaiso in Chili. It is only a few miles in extent, yet it\r\npossesses four land-birds, excluding the powerful Accipitres. These are\r\n_Turdus falklandicus_; _Anæretes {50}fernandensis_, one of the Tyrannidæ;\r\nand two humming-birds, _Eustephanus fernandensis_ and _E. galeritus_. The\r\nfirst is a widespread South Temperate species, the two next are peculiar to\r\nthe island, while the last is a Chilian species which ranges south to\r\nTierra del Fuego. But ninety miles beyond this island lies another, called\r\n\"Mas-a-fuero,\" very much smaller; yet this, too, contains four species of\r\nsimilar birds; one, _Oxyurus mas-a-fueræ_, allied to the wide-spread South\r\nTemperate _O. spinicauda_, and _Cinclodes fusus_, a South Temperate\r\nspecies--both Dendrocolaptidæ; with a humming-bird, _Eustephanus leyboldi_,\r\nallied to the species in the larger island. The preceding facts are taken\r\nfrom papers by Mr. Sclater in the _Ibis_ for 1871, and a later one in the\r\nsame journal by Mr. Salvin (1875). The former author has some interesting\r\nremarks on the three species of humming-birds of the genus _Eustephanus_,\r\nabove referred to. The Chilian species, _E. galeritus_, is green in both\r\nsexes. _E. fernandensis_ has the male of a fine red colour and the female\r\ngreen, though differently marked from the female of _E. galeritus_. _E.\r\nleyboldi_ (of Mas-a-fuera) has the male also red and the female green, but\r\nthe female is more like that of _E. galeritus_, than it is like the female\r\nof its nearer ally in Juan Fernandez. Mr. Sclater supposes, that the\r\nancient parent form of these three birds had the sexes alike, as in the\r\npresent Chilian bird; that a pair (or a female having fertilised ova)\r\nreached Juan Fernandez and colonised it. Under the action of sexual\r\nselection (unchecked by some conditions which had impaired its efficacy on\r\nthe continent) the male gradually assumed a brilliant plumage, and the\r\nfemale also slightly changed its markings. Before this change was completed\r\nthe bird had established an isolated colony on Mas-a-fuera; and here the\r\nprocess of change was continued in the male, but from some unknown cause\r\nchecked in the female, which thus remains nearer the parent form. Lastly\r\nthe slightly modified Chilian bird again reached Juan Fernandez and exists\r\nthere side by side with its strangely altered cousin.\r\n\r\nAll the phenomena can thus be accounted for by known laws, on the theory of\r\nvery rare accidental immigrations from the {51}mainland. The species are\r\nhere so very few, that the greatest advocate for continental extensions\r\nwould hardly call such vast causes into action, to account for the presence\r\nof these three birds on so small and so remote an island, especially as the\r\nunion must have continued down to the time of existing species. But if\r\naccidental immigration has sufficed here, it will also assuredly have\r\nsufficed where the islands are larger, and the chances of reaching them\r\nproportionately greater; and it is because an important principle is here\r\nillustrated on so small a scale, and in so simple a manner as to be almost\r\nundeniable, that we have devoted a paragraph to its elucidation.\r\n\r\nA few Coleoptera from Juan Fernandez present analogous phenomena. All\r\nbelong to Chilian genera, while a portion of them constitute peculiar\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nLand-shells are rather plentiful, there being about twenty species\r\nbelonging to seven genera, all found in the adjacent parts of South\r\nAmerica; but all the species are peculiar, as well as four others found on\r\nthe island of Mas-a-fuera.\r\n\r\n\r\n_III. Tropical North America, or the Mexican Sub-region._\r\n\r\nThis sub-region is of comparatively small extent, consisting of the\r\nirregular neck of land, about 1,800 miles long, which connects the North\r\nand South American continents. Almost the whole of its area is mountainous,\r\nbeing in fact a continuation of the great range of the Rocky Mountains. In\r\nMexico it forms an extensive table-land, from 6,000 to 9,000 feet above the\r\nsea, with numerous volcanic peaks from 12,000 to 18,000 feet high; but in\r\nYucatan and Honduras, the country is less elevated, though still\r\nmountainous. On the shores of the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico, there\r\nis a margin of low land from 50 to 100 miles wide, beyond which the\r\nmountains rise abruptly; but on the Pacific side this is almost entirely\r\nwanting, the mountains rising almost immediately from the sea shore. With\r\nthe exception of the elevated plateaus of Mexico and Guatemala, and the\r\nextremity of the peninsula of Yucatan, the whole of Central America is\r\nclothed with forests; and as its surface is much broken up into hill and\r\nvalley, and the volcanic {52}soil of a large portion of it is very fertile,\r\nit is altogether well adapted to support a varied fauna, as it does a most\r\nluxuriant vegetation. Although many peculiar Neotropical types are absent,\r\nit yet possesses an ample supply of generic and specific forms; and, as far\r\nas concerns birds and insects, is not perhaps inferior to the richest\r\nportions of South America in the number of species to be found in equal\r\nareas.\r\n\r\nOwing to the fact that the former Republic of Mexico comprised much\r\nterritory that belongs to the Nearctic region, and that many Nearctic\r\ngroups extend along the high-lands to the capital city of Mexico itself,\r\nand even considerably further south, there is much difficulty in\r\ndetermining what animals really belong to this sub-region. On the\r\nlow-lands, tropical forms predominate as far as 28° N. latitude; while on\r\nthe cordilleras, temperate forms prevail down to 20°, and are found even\r\nmuch farther within the tropics.\r\n\r\n_Mammalia._--Very few peculiar forms of Mammalia are restricted to tropical\r\nNorth America; which is not to be wondered at when we consider the small\r\nextent of the country, and the facility of communication with adjacent\r\nsub-regions. A peculiar form of tapir (_Elasmognathus bairdi_) inhabits\r\nCentral America, from Panama to Guatemala, and, with _Myxomys_, a genus of\r\nMuridæ, are all at present discovered. _Bassaris_, a remarkable form of\r\nProcyonidæ, has been included in the Nearctic region, but it extends to the\r\nhigh-lands of Guatemala. _Heteromys_, a peculiar genus of Saccomyidæ or\r\npouched rats, inhabits Mexico, Honduras, Costa Rica, and Trinidad. Five\r\ngenera of monkeys extend here,--_Ateles_, _Mycetes_, _Cebus_,\r\n_Nyctipithecus_, and _Saimiris_; the two former alone reaching Mexico, the\r\nlast only going as far as Costa Rica. Other typical Neotropical forms are\r\n_Galera_, the tayra, belonging to the weasel family; _Nasua_, the\r\ncoatimundi; _Dicotyles_, the peccary; _Cercolabes_, the tree porcupine;\r\n_Dasyprocta_, the agouti; _Cælogenys_, the paca; _Choloepus_, and\r\n_Arctopithecus_, sloths; _Cyclothurus_, an ant-eater; _Tatusia_, an\r\narmadillo; and _Didelphys_, oppossum. Of Northern forms, _Sorex_, _Vulpes_,\r\n_Lepus_, and _Pteromys_ reach Guatemala.\r\n\r\n_Birds._--The productiveness of this district in bird life, may {53}be\r\nestimated from the fact, that Messrs. Salvin and Sclater have catalogued\r\nmore than 600 species from the comparatively small territory of Guatemala,\r\nor the portion of Central America between Mexico and Honduras. The great\r\nmass of the birds of this sub-region are of Neotropical families and\r\ngenera, but these are intermingled with a number of migrants from temperate\r\nNorth America, which pass the winter here; with some northern forms on the\r\nhigh-lands; and with a considerable number of peculiar genera, mostly of\r\nNeotropical affinities.\r\n\r\nThe genera of birds peculiar to this sub-region belong to the following\r\nfamilies:--Turdidæ (2 genera); Troglodytidæ (1 gen.); Vireonidæ (1 gen.);\r\nCorvidæ (2 gen.); Ampelidæ (1 gen.); Tanagridæ (1 gen.); Fringillidæ (2\r\ngen.); Icteridæ (1 gen.); Formicariidæ (2 gen.); Tyrannidæ (2 gen.);\r\nCotingidæ (1 gen.); Momotidæ (1 gen.); Trogonidæ (1 gen.); Trochilidæ (14\r\ngen.); Conuridæ (1 gen.); Cracidæ (2 gen.); Strigidæ (1 gen.); in all 37\r\ngenera of land-birds. The Neotropical families that do not extend into this\r\nsub-region are, Pteroptochidæ; the sub-family _Furnariinæ_ of the\r\nDendrocolaptidæ; the sub-family _Conophaginæ_ of the Tyrannidæ; the\r\nsub-family _Rupicolinæ_ of the Cotingidæ; Phytotomidæ; Todidæ;\r\nOpisthocomidæ; Chionididæ; Thinocoridæ; Cariamidæ; Psophiidæ; Eurypygidæ;\r\nPalamedeidæ; and Struthionidæ. On the other hand Paridæ, Certhiidæ,\r\nAmpelidæ, and Phasianidæ, are northern families represented here, but which\r\ndo not reach South America; and there are also several northern genera and\r\nspecies, of Turdidæ, Troglodytidæ, Mniotiltidæ, Vireonidæ, Fringillidæ,\r\nCorvidæ, Tetraonidæ, and Strigidæ, which are similarly restricted. Some of\r\nthe most remarkable of the Neotropical genera only extend as far as Costa\r\nRica and Veragua,--countries which possess a rich and remarkable fauna.\r\nHere only are found an umbrella bird, (_Cephalopterus glabricollis_); a\r\nbell bird (_Chasmorhynchus tricarunculatus_); and species of _Dacnis_\r\n(Ceroebidæ), _Buthraupis_, _Eucometis_, _Tachyphonus_ (Tanagridæ),\r\n_Xiphorhynchus_ (Dendrocolaptidæ); _Hypocnemis_ (Formicariidæ);\r\n_Euscarthmus_ (Tyrannidæ); _Attila_ (Cotingidæ); _Piprites_ (Pipridæ);\r\n_Capito_, _Tetragonops_ (Megalæmidæ); _Selenidera_ (Rhamphastidæ);\r\n_Neomorphus_ {54}(Cuculidæ); _Monasa_ (Bucconidæ); many genera of\r\nTrochilidæ; and _Nothocercus_ (Tinamidæ); none of which extend further\r\nnorth. A considerable number of the peculiar genera noted above, are also\r\nfound in this restricted area, which is probably one of the richest\r\nornithological districts on the globe.\r\n\r\n_Reptiles._--These are much less known than the preceding classes, but they\r\nafford several peculiar and interesting forms. Snakes are perhaps the least\r\nremarkable; yet there are recorded 4 peculiar genera of Calamariidæ, 1 of\r\nColubridæ, 1 of Homalopsidæ, 3 of Dipsadidæ; while _Boa_ and _Elaps_ are in\r\ncommon with South America. Lizards are much more specially developed.\r\n_Chirotes_, one of the Amphisbænians, is confined to Mexico and the\r\nsouthern part of the Nearctic region; _Heloderma_ forming a peculiar\r\nfamily, Helodermidæ, is Mexican only; _Abronia_ and _Barissia_ (Zonuridæ)\r\nare also Mexican, as is _Siderolampus_ belonging to the Scincidæ, while\r\n_Blepharactitis_ (same family) inhabits Nicaragua; _Brachydactylus_, one of\r\nthe geckoes, is from Costa Rica; while _Phymatolepis_, _Lamanctus_,\r\n_Corytheolus_, _Cachrix_, _Corythophanes_ and _Chamæleopsis_, all belonging\r\nto the Iguanidæ, are confined to various parts of the sub-region. In the\r\nsame family we have also the Antillean, _Cyclura_, and the Nearctic\r\n_Phrynosoma_ and _Tropidolepis_, as well as the wide-spread American genus\r\n_Anolius_.\r\n\r\nAmong the tortoises, _Staurotypus_, allied to _Chelydra_, is found in\r\nMexico and Guatemala; and another genus, _Claudius_, has been lately\r\ndescribed from Mexico.\r\n\r\n_Amphibia._--These are chiefly Batrachians; _Rhinophryna_ (forming a\r\npeculiar family) being confined to Mexico; _Triprion_, a genus of Hylidæ,\r\ninhabiting Yucatan, with _Leyla_ and _Strabomantis_ (Polypedatidæ) found\r\nonly in Costa Rica and Veragua, are peculiar genera. The Salamandridæ, so\r\nabundant in the Nearctic region, are represented by a few species of\r\n_Amblystoma_ and _Spelerpes_.\r\n\r\n_Fresh-water fish._--Since the British Museum catalogue was published, a\r\nvaluable paper by Dr. Günther, in the Transactions of the Zoological\r\nSociety for 1868, furnishes much additional information on the fishes of\r\nCentral America. In that part of the region south of Mexico, 106 species of\r\nfresh-water fishes are {55}enumerated; and 17 of these are found in streams\r\nflowing into both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. On the whole, 11\r\nfamilies are represented among the fresh-water fish, and about 38 genera.\r\nOf these, 14 are specially Nearctic,--_Amiurus_ (Siluridæ); _Fundulus_\r\n(Cyprinodontidæ); _Sclerognathus_ (Cyprinidæ); and _Lepidosteus_\r\n(Ganoidei). A much larger number are Neotropical; and several Neotropical\r\ngenera, as _Heros_ and _Poecilia_, are more largely developed here than in\r\nany other part of the region. There are also a considerable number of\r\npeculiar genera;--_Petenia_, _Theraps_, and _Neotrophus_ (Chromides);\r\n_Ælurichthys_ (Siluridæ); _Chalcinopsis_ (Characniidæ); _Characodon_,\r\n_Belonesox_, _Pseudoxiphophorus_, _Platypoecilus_, _Mollienesia_, and\r\n_Xiphophorus_ (Cyprinodontidæ). A few peculiar Antillean forms are also\r\npresent; as _Agonostoma_ (Mugilidæ); _Gambusia_ and _Girardinuus_\r\n(Cyprinodontidæ). The other families represented are Percidæ (1 genus);\r\nPristopomatidæ (2 gen.); Gobiidæ (1 gen.); Clupeidæ (2 gen.); and Gymnotidæ\r\n(1 genus).\r\n\r\nOn the whole the fish-fauna is typically Neotropical, but with a small\r\ninfusion of Nearctic forms. There are a considerable proportion of peculiar\r\ngenera, and almost all the species are distinct from those of other\r\ncountries. The predominant family is that of the Cyprinodontidæ,\r\nrepresented by 12 genera; and the genus _Heros_ (Chromidæ) has here its\r\nmaximum development, containing between thirty and forty species. Dr.\r\nGünther considers that a number of sub-faunas can be distinguished,\r\ncorresponding to some extent, with the islands into which the country would\r\nbe divided by a subsidence of about 2,000 feet. The most important of these\r\ndivisions is that separating Honduras from Costa Rica, and as it also\r\ndivides a very marked ornithological fauna we have every reason to believe\r\nthat such a division must have existed during the latter portion of the\r\ntertiary epoch. We shall find some farther evidence of this division in the\r\nnext class.\r\n\r\n_Insects._--The butterflies of various parts of Central America and Mexico,\r\nhaving been largely collected, offer us some valuable evidence as to the\r\nrelations of this sub-region. Their general character is wholly\r\nNeotropical, about one half of the {56}South American genera being found\r\nhere. There are also a few peculiar genera, as, _Drucina_ (Satyridæ);\r\n_Microtia_ (Nymphalidæ); _Eumæus_ (Lycænidæ); and _Eucheira_ (Pieridæ).\r\n_Clothilda_ (Nymphalidæ) is confined to this sub-region and the Antilles.\r\nThe majority of the genera range over the whole sub-region from Panama to\r\nMexico, but there are a considerable number, comprising many of the most\r\ncharacteristic South American forms, which do not pass north of Costa Rica\r\nor Nicaragua. Such are _Lycorea_, _Ituna_, _Thyridia_, _Callithomia_,\r\n_Oleria_ and _Ceratina_,--all characteristic South American groups of\r\nDanaidæ; _Pronophila_ and _Dynastor_ (Satyridæ); _Protogonius_, _Pycina_,\r\n_Prepona_, _Nica_, _Ectima_ and _Colænis_ (Nymphalidæ); _Eurybia_ and\r\n_Methonella_ (Nemeobiidæ); _Hades_, and _Panthemos_ (Erycinidæ).\r\n\r\n_Coleoptera._--These present some interesting features, but owing to their\r\nvast number only a few of the more important families can be noticed.\r\n\r\nCicindelidæ.--The only specially Neotropical genera recorded as occurring\r\nin this sub-region, are _Ctenostoma_ and _Hiresia_, both reaching Mexico.\r\n\r\nCarabidæ.--Several genera are peculiar. _Molobrus_ is found in all parts of\r\nthe sub-region, while _Onychopterygia_, _Phymatocephalus_, and\r\n_Anisotarsus_ are Mexican only. There are about 20 South American genera,\r\nmost of which extend to Mexico, and include such characteristic Neotropical\r\nforms as _Agra_, _Callida_, _Coptodera_, _Pachyteles_, _Ardistomus_,\r\n_Aspidoglossa_, _Stenocrepis_, and _Pelecium_.\r\n\r\nLucanidæ.--Of this important family there is, strange to say, not a single\r\nspecies recorded in Gemminger and Harold's catalogue up to 1868! It is\r\nalmost impossible that they can be really absent; yet their place seems to\r\nhe, to some extent, supplied by an unusual development of the allied\r\nPassalidæ, of which there are five South American and six peculiar genera.\r\n\r\nCetoniidæ.--All the larger South American genera extend to Mexico, which\r\ncountry possesses 3 peculiar forms, _Ischnoscelis_, _Psilocnemis_, and\r\n_Dialithus_; while _Trigonopeltastes_ is characteristic, having 4 Mexican,\r\n1 Brazilian, and 1 North American species.\r\n\r\n{57}Buprestidæ.--In this family there are no peculiar genera. All the large\r\nSouth American groups are absent, the only important and characteristic\r\ngenus being _Stenogaster_.\r\n\r\nLongicorns.--This important group is largely developed, the country being\r\nwell adapted to them; and their distribution presents some features of\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nIn the Prionidæ there are 6 peculiar genera, the largest being _Holonotus_\r\nwith 3 species; two others, _Derotrachus_ and _Mallaspis_, are\r\ncharacteristic; 3 more are common to South America, and 1 to Cuba. The\r\nCerambycidæ are much more numerous, and there are 24 peculiar genera, the\r\nmost important being _Sphenothecus_, _Entomosterna_, and _Cyphosterna_;\r\nwhile _Crioprosopus_ and _Metaleptus_ are characteristic of the sub-region,\r\nalthough extending into South America; about 12 Neotropical genera extend\r\nto Mexico or Guatemala, while 12 more stop short, as far as yet known, at\r\nNicaragua. Lamiidæ have a very similar distribution; 13 genera are\r\npeculiar, the most important being _Monilema_, _Hamatoderus_, and\r\n_Carneades_, while _Phæa_ and _Lagochirus_ are characteristic. About\r\nsixteen typical Neotropical genera extend to Mexico, and 15 more only reach\r\nNicaragua, among which are such important genera as _Anisopus_,\r\n_Lepturgus_, and _Callia_.\r\n\r\nThe land-shells are not sufficiently known to furnish any corresponding\r\nresults. They are however mostly of South American genera, and have\r\ncomparatively little affinity for those of the Antilles.\r\n\r\n_Relations of the Mexican sub-region to the North and South American\r\nContinents._--The sudden appearance of numerous South American forms of\r\nEdentata in temperate North America, in Post-Tertiary times, as narrated in\r\nChapter VII., together with such facts as the occurrence of a considerable\r\nnumber of identical species of sea fish on the two sides of the Central\r\nAmerican isthmus, render it almost certain that the union of North and\r\nSouth America is comparatively a recent occurrance, and that during the\r\nMiocene and Pliocene periods, they were separated by a wide arm of the sea.\r\nThe low country of Nicaragua was probably the part submerged, leaving the\r\nhighlands of Mexico and Guatemala still united with the North {58}American\r\ncontinent, and forming part of the Tertiary \"Nearctic region.\" This is\r\nclearly indicated both by the many Nearctic forms which do not pass south\r\nof Nicaragua, of which the turkeys (_Meleagris_) are a striking example,\r\nand by the comparative poverty of this area in typical Neotropical groups.\r\nDuring the Miocene period there was not that marked diversity of climate\r\nbetween North and South America that now prevails; for when a luxuriant\r\nvegetation covered what are now the shores of the Arctic Ocean, the country\r\nsouth of the great lakes must have been almost or quite tropical. At an\r\nearly Tertiary period, the zoological differences of the Nearctic and\r\nNeotropical regions were probably more radical than they are now, South\r\nAmerica being a huge island, or group of islands--a kind of Australia of\r\nthe New World, chiefly inhabited by the imperfectly organized Edentata;\r\nwhile North America abounded in Ungulata and Carnivora, and perhaps formed\r\na part of the great Old World continent. There were also one or more very\r\nancient unions (in Eocene or Miocene times) of the two continents,\r\nadmitting of the entrance of the ancestral types of Quadrumana into South\r\nAmerica, and, somewhat later, of the Camelidæ; while the isthmus south of\r\nNicaragua was at one time united to the southern continent, at another made\r\ninsular by subsidence near Panama, and thus obtained that rich variety of\r\nNeotropical types that still characterises it. When the final union of the\r\ntwo continents took place, the tropical climate of the lower portions of\r\nGuatemala and Mexico would invite rapid immigration from the south; while\r\nsome northern forms would extend their range into and beyond the newly\r\nelevated territory. The Mexican sub-region has therefore a composite\r\ncharacter, and we must not endeavour too rigidly to determine its northern\r\nlimits, nor claim as exclusively Neotropical, forms which are perhaps\r\ncomparatively recent immigrants; and it would perhaps be a more accurate\r\nrepresentation of the facts, if we were to consider all the highlands of\r\nMexico and Guatemala above the limits of the tropical forests, as still\r\nbelonging to the Nearctic region, of which the whole country so recently\r\nformed a part.\r\n\r\nThe long-continued separation of North and South America {59}by one or more\r\narms of the sea, as above indicated, is further rendered necessary by the\r\ncharacter of the molluscan fauna of the Pacific shores of tropical America,\r\nwhich is much more closely allied to that of the Caribbean sea, and even of\r\nWest Africa, than to that of the Pacific islands. The families and many of\r\nthe genera are the same, and a certain proportion of very closely allied or\r\nidentical species, shows that the union of the two oceans continued into\r\nlate Tertiary times. When the evidence of both land and sea animals support\r\neach other as they do here, the conclusions arrived at are almost as\r\ncertain as if we had (as we no doubt some day shall have) geological proof\r\nof these successive subsidences.\r\n\r\n_Islands of the Mexican Sub-region._--The only islands of interest\r\nbelonging to this sub-region, are Tres Marias and Socorro, recently\r\ninvestigated by Col. Grayson for some of the American Natural History\r\nsocieties.\r\n\r\nTres Marias consist of four small islands lying off the coast of\r\nnorth-western Mexico, about 70 miles from San Blas. The largest is about 15\r\nmiles long by 10 wide. They are of horizontally stratified deposits, of\r\nmoderate height and flat-topped, and everywhere covered with luxuriant\r\nvirgin forests. They appear to lie within the 100 fathom line of soundings.\r\nFifty-two species of birds, of which 45 were land-birds, were collected on\r\nthese islands. They consisted of 19 Passeres; 11 Picariæ (7 being\r\nhumming-birds); 10 Accipitres; 2 parrots, and 3 pigeons. All were Mexican\r\nspecies except 4, which were new, and presumably peculiar to the islands,\r\nand one tolerably marked variety. The new species belong to the following\r\ngenera;--_Parula_ and _Granatellus_ (Mniotiltidæ); _Icterus_ (Icteridæ);\r\nand _Amazilia_ (Trochilidæ). A small _Psittacula_ differs somewhat from the\r\nsame species on the mainland.\r\n\r\nThere are a few mammalia on the islands; a rabbit (_Lepus_) supposed to be\r\nnew; a very small opossum (_Didelphys_), and a racoon (_Procyon_). There\r\nare also several tree-snakes, a _Boa_, and many lizards. The occurrence of\r\nso many mammalia and snakes is a proof that these islands have been once\r\njoined to the mainland; but the fact that some of the species of both birds\r\nand {60}mammals are peculiar, indicates that the separation is not a very\r\nrecent one. At the same time, as all the species are very closely allied to\r\nthose of the opposite coasts when not identical, we may be sure that the\r\nsubsidence which isolated them is not geologically remote.\r\n\r\nSocorro, the largest of the Revillagigedo Islands, is altogether different\r\nfrom the Tres Marias. It is situated a little further south (19 S.\r\nLatitude), and about 300 miles from the coast, in deep water. It is about\r\n2,000 feet high, very rugged and bare, and wholly volcanic. No mammalia\r\nwere observed, and no reptiles but a small lizard, a new species of a genus\r\n(_Uta_) characteristic of the deserts of N.-Western Mexico. The only\r\nobserved land-shell (_Orthalicus undatus_) also inhabits N.-W. Mexico. Only\r\n14 species of birds were obtained, of which 9 were land-birds; but of these\r\n4 were new species, one a peculiar variety, and another (_Parula\r\ninsularis_) a species first found in the Tres Marias. With the exception of\r\nthis bird and a _Buteo_, all the land-birds belonged to different _genera_\r\nfrom any found on the Tres Marias, though all were Mexican forms. The\r\npeculiar species belonged to the genera _Harporhynchus_ (Turdidæ);\r\n_Troglodytes_ (Troglodytidæ); _Pipilo_ (Fringillidæ); _Zenaidura_\r\n(Columbidæ); and a variety of _Conurus holochrous_ (Psittacidæ).\r\n\r\nThe absence of mammals and snakes, the large proportion of peculiar\r\nspecies, the wholly volcanic nature of these islands, and their situation\r\nin deep water 300 miles from land,--all indicate that they have not formed\r\npart of the continent, but have been raised in the ocean; and the close\r\nrelation of their peculiar species to those living in N.-Western Mexico,\r\nrenders it probable that their antiquity is not geologically great.\r\n\r\nThe Cocos Islands, about 300 miles S.-W. of the Isthmus of Panama, are\r\nknown to possess one peculiar bird, a cuckoo of the _Coccyzus_ type, which\r\nis considered by some ornithologists to constitute a peculiar genus,\r\n_Nesococcyx_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_IV. The West Indian Islands, or Antillean Sub-region._\r\n\r\nThe West Indian islands are, in many respects, one of the most interesting\r\nof zoological sub-regions. In position they {61}form an unbroken chain\r\nuniting North and South America, in a line parallel to the great Central\r\nAmerican isthmus; yet instead of exhibiting an intermixture of the\r\nproductions of Florida and Venezuela, they differ widely from both these\r\ncountries, possessing in some groups a degree of speciality only to be\r\nfound elsewhere in islands far removed from any continent. They consist of\r\ntwo very large islands, Cuba and Hayti;[3] two of moderate size, Jamaica\r\nand Portorico; and a chain of much smaller islands, St. Croix, Anguilla,\r\nBarbuda, Antigua, Guadeloupe, Dominica, Martinique, St. Lucia, St. Vincent,\r\nBarbadoes, and Grenada, with a host of intervening islets. Tobago,\r\nTrinidad, Margarita, and Curaçao, are situated in shallow water near the\r\ncoast of South America, of which they form part zoologically. To the north\r\nof Cuba and Hayti are the Bahamas, an extensive group of coral reefs and\r\nislands, 700 miles long, and although very poor in animal life, belonging\r\nzoologically to the Antilles. All the larger islands, and most of the\r\nsmaller ones (except those of coral formation) are very mountainous and\r\nrocky, the chains rising to about 8,000 feet in Hayti and Jamaica, and to\r\nnearly the same height in Cuba. All, except where they have been cleared by\r\nman, are covered with a luxuriant forest vegetation; the temperature is\r\nhigh and uniform; the rains ample; the soil, derived from granitic and\r\nlimestone rocks, exceedingly fertile; and as the four larger islands\r\ntogether are larger than Great Britain, we might expect an ample and\r\nluxuriant fauna. The reverse is however the case; and there are probably no\r\nland areas on the globe, so highly favoured by nature in all the essentials\r\nfor supporting animal life, and at the same time so poor in all the more\r\nhighly organised groups of animals. Before entering upon our sketch of the\r\nmain features of this peculiar but limited fauna, it will be well to note a\r\nfew peculiarities in the physical structure of the islands, which have an\r\nimportant bearing on their past {62}history, and will enable us to account\r\nfor much that is peculiar in the general character of their natural\r\nproductions.\r\n\r\nIf we draw a line immediately south of St. Croix and St. Bartholomew, we\r\nshall divide the Archipelago into two very different groups. The southern\r\nrange of islands, or the Lesser Antilles, are, almost without exception,\r\nvolcanic; beginning with the small detached volcanoes of Saba and St.\r\nEustatius, and ending with the old volcano of Grenada. Barbuda and Antigua\r\nare low islands of Tertiary or recent formation, connected with the\r\nvolcanic islands by a submerged bank at no great depth. The islands to the\r\nnorth and west are none of them volcanic; many are very large, and these\r\nhave all a central nucleus of ancient or granitic rocks. We must also note,\r\nthat the channels between these islands are not of excessive depth, and\r\nthat their outlines, as well as the direction of their mountain ranges,\r\npoint to a former union. Thus, the northern range of Hayti is continued\r\nwestward in Cuba, and eastward in Portorico; while the south-western\r\npeninsula extends in a direct line towards Jamaica, the depth between them\r\nbeing 600 fathoms. Between Portorico and Hayti there is only 250 fathoms;\r\nwhile close to the south of all these islands the sea is enormously deep,\r\nfrom more than 1,000 fathoms south of Cuba and Jamaica, to 2,000 south of\r\nHayti, and 2,600 fathoms near the south-east extremity of Portorico. The\r\nimportance of the division here pointed out will be seen, when we state,\r\nthat indigenous mammalia of peculiar genera are found on the western group\r\nof islands only; and it is on these that all the chief peculiarities of\r\nAntillian zoology are developed.\r\n\r\n_Mammalia._--The mammals of the West Indian Islands are exceedingly few,\r\nbut very interesting. Almost all the orders most characteristic of South\r\nAmerica are absent. There are no monkeys, no carnivora, no edentata.\r\nBesides bats, which are abundant, only two orders are represented; rodents,\r\nby peculiar forms of a South American family; and insectivora (an order\r\nentirely wanting in South America) by a genus belonging to a family largely\r\ndeveloped in Madagascar and found nowhere else. The early voyagers mention\r\n\"Coatis\" and \"Agoutis\" as being {63}found in Hayti and the other large\r\nislands, and it is not improbable that species allied to _Nasua_ and\r\n_Dasyprocta_ did exist, and have been destroyed by the dogs of the\r\ninvaders; though, on the other hand, these names may have been applied to\r\nthe existing species, which do bear some general resemblance to these two\r\nforms.\r\n\r\nThe Chiroptera, or bats, are represented by a large number of species and\r\nby several peculiar genera. The American family of Phyllostomidæ or\r\nvampires, has six genera in the Antilles, of which three, _Lonchorina_,\r\n_Brachyphylla_, and _Phyllonycteris_, are peculiar, the latter being found\r\nonly in Cuba. The Vespertilionidæ have four genera, of which one,\r\n_Nycticellus_, is confined to Cuba. There are six genera of Noctilionidæ,\r\nof which one, _Phyllodia_, is confined to Jamaica.\r\n\r\nThe Insectivora are represented by the genus _Solenodon_, of which two\r\nspecies are known, one inhabiting Cuba the other Hayti. These are small\r\nanimals about the size of a cat, with long shrew-like snout, bare rat-like\r\ntail, and long claws. Their peculiar dentition and other points of their\r\nanatomy shows that they belong to the family Centetidæ, of which five\r\ndifferent genera inhabit Madagascar; while there is nothing closely allied\r\nto them in any other part of the world but in these two islands.\r\n\r\nSeals are said to be found on the shores of some of the islands, but they\r\nare very imperfectly known.\r\n\r\nThe rodents belong to the family Octodontidæ, or, according to some\r\nauthors, to the Echimyidæ, both characteristic South American groups. They\r\nconsist of two genera, _Capromys_, containing three or four species\r\ninhabiting Cuba and Jamaica; while _Plagiodontia_ (very closely allied) is\r\nconfined to Hayti. A peculiar mouse, a species of the American genus\r\n_Hesperomys_, is said to inhabit Hayti and Martinique, and probably other\r\nislands. A _Dasyprocta_ or agouti, closely allied to, if not identical\r\nwith, a South American species, inhabits St. Vincent, St. Lucia, and\r\nGrenada, and perhaps St. Thomas, and is the only mammal of any size\r\nindigenous to the Lesser Antilles. All the islands in which sugar is\r\ncultivated are, however, overrun with European rats and mice, and it is not\r\nimprobable that these may have {64}starved out and exterminated some of the\r\nsmaller native rodents.\r\n\r\n_Birds._--The birds of the Antilles, although very inferior in number and\r\nvariety to those of the mainland, are yet sufficiently abundant and\r\nremarkable, to offer us good materials for elucidating the past history of\r\nthe country, when aided by such indications as geology and physical\r\ngeography can afford.\r\n\r\nThe total number of land-birds which are permanent residents in the West\r\nIndia islands is, as nearly as can be ascertained from existing materials,\r\n203. There are, in addition to this number, according to Prof. Baird, 88\r\nmigrants from North America, which either spend the winter in some of the\r\nislands or pass on to Central or South America. These migrants belong to 55\r\ngenera, and it is an interesting fact that so many as 40 of these genera\r\nhave no resident representatives in the islands. This is important, as\r\nshowing that this northern migration is probably a recent and superficial\r\nphenomenon, and has not produced any (or a very slight) permanent effect on\r\nthe fauna. The migratory genera which have permanent residents, and almost\r\nalways representative species, in the islands, are in most cases\r\ncharacteristic rather of the Neotropical than of the Nearctic fauna, as the\r\nfollowing list will show; _Turdus_, _Dendroeca_, _Vireo_, _Polioptila_,\r\n_Agelæus_, _Icterus_, _Contopus_, _Myiarchus_, _Tyrannus_, _Antrostomus_,\r\n_Chordeiles_, _Coccyzus_, _Columba_. By far the larger part of these birds\r\nvisit Cuba only; 81 species being recorded as occurring in that island,\r\nwhile only 31 have been found in Jamacia, 12 in Porto Rico and St. Croix,\r\nand 2 in Tobago and Trinidad. Setting aside these migratory birds, as\r\nhaving no bearing on the origin of the true Antillean fauna, we will\r\ndiscuss the residents somewhat in detail.\r\n\r\nThe resident land-birds (203 in number) belong to 95 genera and 26\r\nfamilies. Of these families 15 are cosmopolitan or nearly so--Turdidæ,\r\nSylviidæ, Corvidæ, Hirundinidæ, Fringillidæ, Picidæ, Cuculidæ,\r\nCaprimulgidæ, Cypselidæ, Trogonidæ, Psittacidæ, Columbidæ, Tetraonidæ,\r\nFalconidæ, and Strigidæ; 5 are American only--Vireonidæ, Mniotiltidæ,\r\nIcteridæ, Tyrannidæ, Trochilidæ; 4 are Netropical only or almost\r\n{65}exclusively--Coerebidæ, Tanagridæ, Cotingidæ, Conuridæ; 1 is Antillean\r\nonly--Todidæ; while 1--Ampelidæ--is confined (in the western hemisphere) to\r\nNorth America, and almost to the Nearctic region. Of the 95 genera, no less\r\nthan 31, or almost exactly one-third, are peculiar; while of the 203\r\nresident species, 177 are peculiar, the other 26 being all inhabitants of\r\nSouth or Central America. Considering how closely the islands approach the\r\ncontinent in several places--Florida, Yucatan, and Venezuela--this amount\r\nof speciality in such locomotive creatures as birds, is probably unexampled\r\nin any other part of the globe. The most interesting of these peculiar\r\ngenera are the following: 4 of Turdidæ, or thrushes--1 confined to the\r\nlarge islands, 1 to the whole archipelago, while 2 are limited to the\r\nLesser Antilles; 2 genera of Tanagridæ, confined to the larger islands; 2\r\nof Trogonidæ, also confined to the larger islands; 5 of hummingbirds, 3\r\nconfined to the Greater, 1 to the Lesser Antilles; 2 of cuckoos, one\r\nrepresented in all the large islands, the other in Jamaica only; 2 of owls,\r\none peculiar to Jamaica, the other represented in St. Croix, St. Thomas,\r\nPortorico, and Cuba; and lastly, _Todus_, constituting a peculiar family,\r\nand having representative species in each of the larger islands, is\r\nespecially interesting because it belongs to a group of families which are\r\nwholly Neotropical--the Momotidæ, Galbulidæ, and Todidæ. The presence of\r\nthis peculiar form, with 2 trogons; 10 species of parrots, all but one\r\npeculiar; 16 peculiar humming-birds belonging to 8 genera; a genus of\r\nCotingidæ; 10 peculiar tanagers belonging to 3 genera; 9 Coerebidæ of 3\r\ngenera; together with species of such exclusively Netropical genera as\r\n_Coereba_, _Certhiola_, _Sycalis_, _Phonipara_, _Elainea_, _Pitangus_,\r\n_Campephilus_, _Chloronerpes_, _Nyctibius_, _Stenopsis_, _Lampornis_,\r\n_Calypte_, _Ara_, _Chrysotis_, _Zenaida_, _Leptoptila_, and _Geotrygon_,\r\nsufficiently demonstrate the predominant affinities of this fauna; although\r\nthere are many cases in which it is difficult to say, whether the ancestors\r\nof the peculiar genera or species may not have been derived from the\r\nNearctic rather than from the Neotropical region.\r\n\r\nThe several islands differ considerably in their apparent\r\n{66}productiveness, but this is, no doubt, partly due to our knowledge of\r\nCuba and Jamaica being much more complete than of Hayti. The species of\r\nresident land-birds at present known are as follows:--\r\n\r\n  Cuba               68 species of which 40 are peculiar to it.\r\n  Hayti              40    \"         \"   17         \"        \"\r\n  Jamaica            67    \"         \"   41         \"        \"\r\n  Portorico          40    \"         \"   15         \"        \"\r\n  Lesser Antilles    45    \"         \"   24         \"        \"\r\n\r\nIf we count the peculiar genera of each island, and reckon as (½) when a\r\ngenus is common to two islands only, the numbers are as follows:--Cuba 7½,\r\nHayti 3½, Jamaica 8½, Portorico 1, Lesser Antilles 3½. These figures show\r\nus, that although Jamaica is one of the smaller and the most isolated of\r\nthe four chief islands, it yet stands in the first rank, both for the\r\nnumber of its species and of its peculiar forms of birds,--and although\r\nthis superiority may be in part due to its having been more investigated,\r\nit is probably not wholly so, since Cuba has also been well explored. This\r\nfact indicates, that the West Indian islands have undergone great changes,\r\nand that they were not peopled by immigration from surrounding countries\r\nwhile in the condition we now see them; for in that case the smaller and\r\nmore remote islands would be very much poorer, while Cuba, which is not\r\nonly the largest, but nearest to the mainland in two directions, would be\r\nimmensely richer, just as it really is in migratory birds.\r\n\r\nThe number of birds common to the four larger islands is very\r\nsmall--probably not more than half a dozen; between 20 and 30 are common to\r\nsome two of the islands (counting the Lesser Antilles as one island) and a\r\nfew to three; but the great mass of the species (at least 140) are confined\r\neach to some one of the five islands or groups we have indicated. This is\r\nan amount of isolation and speciality, probably not to be equalled\r\nelsewhere, and which must have required a remarkable series of physical\r\nchanges to bring about. What those changes probably were, we shall be in a\r\nbetter position to consider when we have completed our survey of the\r\nvarious classes of land animals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlate XVII.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nA SCENE IN CUBA, WITH CHARACTERISTIC ANIMALS.\r\n\r\n{67}In the preceding enumeration the Bahamas have been included with Cuba,\r\nas regards the birds they have in common; but they possess some half dozen\r\nspecies not found elsewhere, and even one central American genus of\r\nhumming-birds (_Doricha_) not found in any other part of the Antilles. We\r\nhave thus given Cuba rather more peculiar species than it really possesses,\r\nso that the proportionate richness of Jamaica is rather greater than shown\r\nby our figures.\r\n\r\nThe destruction of the forests and the increase of population, with,\r\nperhaps, the use of firearms, seem to have led to the extermination of some\r\nspecies of birds in the smaller islands. Professor Newton has called\r\nattention to the work of M. Ledru, who, in 1796, described the birds of St.\r\nThomas. He mentions a parrot and a parroquet in the island, the latter only\r\nbeing now known, and very scarce; also a green pigeon and a tody, both now\r\nunknown. No less than six species of parrots are said to have been formerly\r\nfound in Guadeloupe and Martinique, which are now extinct.\r\n\r\n_Plate XVII. Illustrating the peculiar Mammalia and Birds of the\r\nAntilles._--The scene of this illustration is Cuba, the largest of the West\r\nIndian islands, and one in which all its peculiar zoological features are\r\nwell developed. In the foreground is the agouta (_Solenodon cubanus_), a\r\nremarkable insectivorous animal which, with another species inhabiting\r\nHayti, has no allies on the American continent; nor anywhere in the world\r\nbut in Madagascar, where a group of animals are found constituting the\r\nfamily Centetidæ, to which _Solenodon_ is said undoubtedly to belong. Above\r\nit are a pair of hutias (_Capromys fournieri_), rat-like animals belonging\r\nto the South American family Octodontidæ. They live in the forests, and\r\nclimb trees readily, eating all kinds of vegetable food. Three species of\r\nthe genus are known, which are found only in Cuba and Jamaica. Just above\r\nthese animals is a white-breasted trogon (_Prionoteles temnurus_), confined\r\nto Cuba, and the only species of the genus. Near the top of the picture are\r\na pair of todies (_Todus multicolor_), singular little insectivorous birds\r\nallied to the motmots, but forming a very distinct family which is confined\r\nto the islands of the {68}Greater Antilles. They are beautifully-coloured\r\nbirds,--green above, red and white beneath, and are exceedingly active in\r\ntheir movements. To the right are a pair of small humming-birds\r\n(_Sporadinus ricordi_), not very remarkable in this beautiful family, but\r\nintroduced here because they belong to a genus which is confined to the\r\nGreater Antilles.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Table of distribution of West-Indian Birds._--As the birds of the West\r\nIndian islands are particularly interesting and their peculiarities\r\ncomparatively little known, we give here a table of the genera of\r\nland-birds, compiled from all available sources of information. Owing to\r\nthe numerous independent observations on which it is founded, the\r\ndiscrepancies of nomenclature, and uncertainty in some cases as to the\r\nlocality of species, it can only be looked upon as an approximative summary\r\nof the existing materials on Antillean ornithology.\r\n\r\n\r\n_TABLE OF THE RESIDENT LAND-BIRDS OF THE ANTILLES._\r\n\r\nNOTE.--Genera confined to the West Indies are in Italics. An (_a_) after\r\n(1) indicates a species common to two islands: but where there are two or\r\nmore species in an island, or the localities are doubtful, this indication\r\ncannot be given. All species not otherwise noted are peculiar to the\r\nAntilles.\r\n\r\n  Key to columns:\r\n  Column 1 Cuba.\r\n     \"   2 Bahamas.\r\n     \"   3 Hayti.\r\n     \"   4 Jamaica.\r\n     \"   5 Portorico & St. Croix.\r\n     \"   6 Lesser Antilles.\r\n     \"   7 Total resident species.\r\n\r\n  ----------------+-----------------------------+----+---------------------\r\n                  |      Number of Species in   |    |\r\n     Family and   |         each Island.        |    |\r\n       Genus.     +----+----+----+----+----+----+    |   Remarks.\r\n                  |  1 |  2 |  3 |  4 |  5 |  6 |  7 |\r\n  ----------------+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+---------------------\r\n  TURDIDÆ.        |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |\r\n   Turdus         | -- | -- | -- |  1 | -- | -- |  1 | Five species migrate\r\n                  |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    to Cuba\r\n   _Mimocichla_   |  2 |  1 |  1 |  1 | -- | -- |  5 |\r\n   _Margarops_    | -- | -- | 1a | -- | 1a |  3 |  4 | Martinique, St.\r\n                  |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |   Lucia, Guada.\r\n   _Rhamphocinclus_ -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |  1 |  1 | Martinique and St.\r\n                  |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |   Lucia\r\n   _Cinclocerthia_| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |  3 |  3 | Nevis to St. Lucia\r\n   Mimus          |  1 |  1 | -- |  1 | (?)| -- |  3 | Another species\r\n                  |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |   migrates to the\r\n                  |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |   Antilles\r\n                  |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |\r\n  SYLVIIDÆ.       |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |\r\n   Myiadestes     |  1 | -- | -- |  1 | -- |  1 |  3 | St. Lucia\r\n   Polioptila     |  1 | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |  1 |\r\n                  |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |\r\n  VIREONIDÆ.      |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |\r\n   Vireosylvia    |  1 | -- |  1 |  1 |  1 |  1 |  2 | One S.

The\r\nfollowing enumeration of the chief groups hitherto noticed or described,\r\nwill, however, show very similar features to those presented by the\r\nbirds--a general relation to Neotropical forms, a more special relation to\r\nthose of Central America and Mexico, and a considerable number of peculiar\r\ntypes.\r\n\r\nSnakes.--_Arrhyton_ (Calamariidæ) from Cuba, _Hypsirhynchus_ from\r\nBarbadoes, _Cryptodacus_ from Cuba, _Ialtris_ from Hayti, and _Coloragia_\r\nfrom Cuba (all Colubridæ), have been described as genera peculiar to the\r\nAntilles. _Phylodryas_ and _Dromicus_ (Colubridæ) are Antillean and\r\nNeotropical; _Ahætulla_, (Dendrophidæ) has the same distribution but\r\nextends to tropical Africa; _Epicrates_ and _Corallus_ (Pythonidæ) are\r\nNeotropical and Antillean; while _Chilabothrus_ from Jamaica and _Ungalia_\r\nfrom Cuba and Jamaica (both Pythonidæ) are found elsewhere only in Central\r\nAmerica and Mexico. There appear to be no Crotalidæ except an introduced\r\nspecies of _Craspedocephalus_ in St. Lucia.\r\n\r\nLizards are more numerous. _Ameiva_ (Teidæ) is found all over America,\r\n_Gerrhonotus_ (Zonuridæ) is Neotropical and occurs in Cuba; _Gymnopthalmus_\r\nis South American and Antillean. Of Scincidæ seven genera are noted.\r\n_Celestus_ (with 9 species) is peculiar to the Antilles; _Camilia_ (1\r\nspecies) to Jamaica, _Panoplus_ (1 species) and _Embryopus_ (1 species) to\r\nHayti; _Diplogossus_ is Antillean and South American; while _Plestiodon_\r\nand _Mabouya_ are cosmopolite. Of Geckotidæ there are four genera;\r\n_Phyllodactylus_ and _Hemidactylus_ which are cosmopolite; _Sphærodactylus_\r\nwhich is wholly American; and _Cubina_ found only in Martinique and Brazil.\r\nOf Iguanidæ there are six genera; _Anolis_, which ranges all over America;\r\n_Polychrus_, which is Neotropical; _Iguana_ and _Liocephalus_ which are\r\nSouth American; _Tropedurus_ found in Cuba and Brazil; and _Cyclura_ only\r\nknown from Jamaica, Cuba, and Central America.\r\n\r\n_Amphibia._--The genus _Trachycephalus_, belonging to the {73}Hylidæ or\r\ntropical tree-frogs, is almost peculiar to the Antilles; Cuba, Hayti, and\r\nJamaica possessing seven species, while only one is recorded from South\r\nAmerica. Other genera are, _Peltaphryne_ (Bufonidæ) from Portorico;\r\n_Phyllobates_ (Polypedatidæ) from Cuba; _Leiuperus_ (Ranidæ) from\r\nHayti,--all Neotropical. Of the Urodela, or tailed batrachians, no\r\nrepresentative occurs, although they are so characteristic a feature of the\r\nNearctic region.\r\n\r\n_Fresh-water fish._--The same general remarks apply to these as to the\r\nreptiles. Only one peculiar genus is noted--_Lebistes_, a form of\r\nCyprinodontidæ from Barbadoes; other genera of the same family being,\r\n_Haplochilus_, _Rivulus_, and _Girardinus_, widely spread in the\r\nNeotropical region; while _Gambusia_ is confined to Central America,\r\nMexico, and the Antilles. Four other families are represented; Siluridæ by\r\n_Chætostomus_, found in Portorico and South America; Chromidæ by the South\r\nAmerican _Acara_; Mugillidæ by the Central American _Agonostoma_; and\r\nPercidæ by the North American _Centrarchus_, of which a species is recorded\r\nfrom Cuba.\r\n\r\n_Insects._--The various West Indian islands have not been well explored\r\nentomologically; one reason no doubt being, that their comparative poverty\r\nrenders them little attractive to the professional collector, while the\r\nabounding riches of Central and South America lie so near at hand. We can,\r\ntherefore, hardly tell whether the comparative poverty, or even total\r\nabsence of some families while others seem fairly represented, is a real\r\nphenomenon of distribution, or only dependent on imperfect knowledge.\r\nBearing this in mind, we proceed to give a sketch of what is known of the\r\nchief groups of Lepidoptera and Coleoptera.\r\n\r\n_Lepidoptera._--The Neotropical butterfly-fauna is but poorly represented,\r\nthe majority of the most remarkable types being entirely wanting; yet there\r\nare a few peculiar and very characteristic forms which show great\r\nisolation, while the majority of the species are peculiar. Four genera are\r\nexclusively or characteristically Antillean,--_Calisto_ belonging to the\r\nSatyridæ, with four species, of which one ranges to South Carolina;\r\n_Clothilda_ {74}(Nymphalidæ) a fine genus which has 4 Antillean species and\r\n2 in Central America; _Lucinia_ (Nymphalidæ) 2 species, confined to Jamaica\r\nand Hayti; and _Kricogonia_ belonging to the Pieridæ, which has 2 West\r\nIndian species, while 1 inhabits Mexico and Florida. Genera which show a\r\nspecial relation to Central America are _Euptoieta_, _Eumæus_, and\r\n_Nathalis_. Almost all the other genera are South American, the total\r\nnumber recorded in each family as occurring in the West Indian islands,\r\nbeing, 3 of Danaidæ; 1 of Heliconiidæ; 2 of Satyridæ; 18 of Nymphalidæ; 1\r\nof Erycinidæ; 4 of Lycænidæ; 6 of Pieridæ; 1 of Papilionidæ, and 10 of\r\nHesperidæ. The genus _Papilio_ is represented by about 20 species, 2 of\r\nwhich are North American, 4 South American, while the rest form little\r\ncharacteristic groups allied to those of Central America. The most marked\r\nfeature seems to be the scarcity of Satyridæ and the almost total absence\r\nof Erycinidæ, with a great deficiency in characteristic Neotropical forms\r\nof Danaidæ and Nymphalidæ.\r\n\r\n_Coleoptera._--Cicindelidæ and Carabidæ are very poorly represented, by a\r\nfew species of wide-spread groups, and hardly any peculiar genera. No\r\nLucanidæ are recorded. Of Cetoniidæ, _Gymnetis_ only appears to be\r\nrepresented. Buprestidæ seem to be more numerous; 15 genera being recorded,\r\nbut almost all of wide distribution. One only is\r\npeculiar--_Tetragonoschoma_, found in Hayti; _Halecia_ is the only\r\nexclusively South American genus; _Chalcophora_ is widely scattered over\r\nthe tropical regions but is absent from South America, yet it occurs in the\r\nNearctic region and extends to Jamaica and Guadeloupe. We now come to the\r\nLongicorns, the only group of Coleoptera which seems to be well\r\nrepresented, or which has been carefully collected. No less than 40 genera\r\nare known from the West Indian islands, and 15 of these are peculiar.\r\nPrionidæ are proportionately very numerous, there being 10 genera, 2 of\r\nwhich are widely distributed in both South and North America, 1 is North\r\nAmerican, and 1 South American, while the following are\r\npeculiar,--_Stenodontes_ (Hayti and Cuba); _Dendroblaptus_ (Cuba);\r\n_Monodesmus_ (Cuba and Jamaica); _Prosternodes_ (Cuba); _Solenoptera_ and\r\n_Elateropsis_, the two largest genera found in most of the {75}islands. Of\r\nCerambycidæ there are 16 genera, 2 of which range all over America, 4 are\r\nNeotropical, 1 South American only, while the following are confined to the\r\nislands,--_Merostenus_, _Pentomacrus_, and _Eburiola_ (Jamaica);\r\n_Bromiades_ (Cuba); _Trichrous_, _Heterops_, and _Pæciloderma_ (Antilles).\r\nOne genus, _Smodicum_, is widely spread, having a species in Carolina, 1 in\r\nSouth America, 1 in Hayti, and 1 in West Africa. Of Lamiidæ there are 14\r\ngenera, 8 of which are Neotropical, 1 common to Central America and Mexico,\r\n1 to the United States and Cuba, while 2, _Proecha_ and _Phidola_, are\r\nconfined to Cuba. Several of the genera are curiously\r\ndistributed;--_Spalacopsis_ is South American, with 4 species in Cuba and\r\nTropical Africa; _Lagocheirus_ is Neotropical, with a species in Australia;\r\nwhile _Leptostilus_ is characteristic of the Antilles and North America,\r\nwith a few species in South America, and one in New Zealand. These cases of\r\nerratic distribution, so opposed to the general series of phenomena among\r\nwhich they occur, must be held to be sufficiently explained by the great\r\nantiquity of these groups and their former wide distribution. They may be\r\nsupposed to be the remnants of types, now dying out, which were once, like\r\n_Callichroma_, _Clytus_, and many others, almost universally distributed.\r\n\r\nAll the peculiar Antillean genera of Cerambycidæ and Lamiidæ are allied to\r\nNeotropical forms. The peculiar Prionidæ, however, are mostly allied to\r\nMexican and North American groups, and one, _Monodesmus_, belongs to a\r\ngroup all the other genera of which inhabit the East Indies and South\r\nAfrica.\r\n\r\n_Land-shells._--This subject has already been generally treated under the\r\nRegion, of which, in this class of animals, the Antilles form so important\r\na part. We must therefore now confine ourselves mainly to the internal\r\ndistribution of the genera, and to a few remarks on the general bearing of\r\nthe facts.\r\n\r\nThe excessive and altogether unexampled productiveness of the West Indian\r\nislands in land-shells, may be traced to two main sets of causes. The first\r\nand least known, consist of the peculiar influences and conditions which\r\nrender islands always more productive than continents. Whatever these\r\nconditions {76}are, they will be more effective where the islands have been\r\nlong separated from the mainland, as is here undoubtedly the case. It seems\r\nmost probable that the great development of land-shells in islands, is due\r\nto the absence or deficiency of the vertebrata, which on continents supply\r\na variety of species adapted to prey upon these molluscs. This view is\r\nsupported by the fact, that in such islands as have been united to a\r\ncontinent at no very distant epoch, and still maintain a continental\r\nvariety of vertebrata, no such special development of land-shells has taken\r\nplace. If we compare the Philippine islands with the Sunda group, we find\r\nthe development of vertebrata and land-molluscs in inverse ratio to each\r\nother. The same thing occurs if we compare New Zealand and Tasmania; and we\r\nhave a still more striking example in the Antillean group itself,\r\ncontinental Trinidad having only 20 genera and 38 species, while the highly\r\ninsular Jamaica has about 30 genera and more than 500 species.\r\n\r\nThe other causes favourable to the increase and development of land-shells\r\nare of a physical nature. A great extent of limestone-rock is one; and in\r\nthe larger West Indian islands we have a considerable proportion of the\r\nsurface consisting of this rock. But perhaps equally or more important, is\r\nthe character of the land surface, and the texture of the exposed rock\r\nitself. A much broken surface, with numerous deep ravines, cutting up the\r\nwhole country into isolated valleys and ridges, seems very favourable to\r\nthe specialization of forms in this very sedentary class of animals.\r\nEqually favourable is a honeycombed and highly-fissured rock-surface,\r\naffording everywhere cracks and crannies for concealment. Now, taking\r\nJamaica as an example of the archipelago, we find all these conditions in a\r\nwonderful degree. Over a large part of this island, a yard of level ground\r\ncan hardly be found; but ridges, precipices, ravines, and rock-bound\r\nvalleys, succeed each other over the whole country. At least five-sixths of\r\nthe entire surface is limestone, and under the influence of tropical rains\r\nthis rock is worn, fissured, and honeycombed, so as to afford ample shelter\r\nand concealment for land-shells.\r\n\r\n{77}It is probable that the three chief islands, Cuba, Jamaica and Hayti,\r\nare nearly equally rich in land-shells; but the last is very much less\r\nknown, and therefore, perhaps, appears to be much poorer. Cuba has rather\r\nmore species than Jamaica; but while the former has only 1 peculiar genus\r\n(_Diplopoma_), the latter has 3 (_Geomelania_, _Chittya_, and _Jamaicea_),\r\nas well as two others only represented in the other islands by single\r\nspecies. From Hayti, only about one-third as many species are known as from\r\nthe two former islands. It has no peculiar genera, but it has some forms in\r\ncommon with Cuba and others with Jamaica, which show that those islands\r\nhave more connection with it, than with each other; just as we found to be\r\nthe case in birds. Portorico and the Virgin islands have still fewer\r\nspecies than Hayti; and, as many of the genera common to the other three\r\nislands are wanting, there is, no doubt, here a real deficiency. In the\r\nislands farther south (Barbuda to Martinique) more Antillean genera\r\ndisappear or become very rare, while some continental forms take their\r\nplace. The islands from St. Lucia to Trinidad have a still more continental\r\ncharacter; the genus _Bulimus_, so largely developed on the continent, only\r\nreaching St. Lucia. The Bahamas contain about 80 species of land-shells, of\r\nwhich 25 are Antillean, the rest peculiar; all the genera being Antillean.\r\nThe affinity is chiefly with Hayti and Cuba, but closest with the latter\r\nisland.\r\n\r\nIn the West Indian islands as a whole, there are 11 peculiar genera; 9\r\noperculate (_Geomelania_, _Chittya_, _Jamaicea_, _Licina_, _Choanopoma_,\r\n_Ctenopoma_, _Diplopoma_, _Stoastoma_, _Lucidella_); and 2 inoperculate\r\n(_Sagda_ and _Stenopus_), besides _Cyclostomus_, which belongs to the Old\r\nWorld and is not found on the American continent. Mr. Bland considers, that\r\nmany of the Antillean land-shells exhibit decided African and Asiatic,\r\nrather than South American affinities. A species of the Asiatic genus\r\n_Diplommatina_ has been found in Trinidad, and an Indian species of _Ennea_\r\noccurs in Grenada and St. Thomas; a clear indication that land-shells are\r\nliable to be accidentally imported, and to become established in the less\r\nproductive islands.\r\n\r\nAlthough these islands are so wonderfully rich even now, {78}there is good\r\nreason to believe that many species have become extinct since the European\r\noccupation of them. When small islands are much cultivated, many of these\r\nmolluscs which can only live under the shade of forests, are soon\r\nextirpated. In St. Croix many species have become extinct at a\r\ncomparatively recent period, from the burning of forests; and as we know\r\nthat in all the islands many of the species are excessively local, being\r\noften confined to single valleys or ridges, we may be sure that wherever\r\nthe native forests have disappeared before the hand of man, numbers of land\r\nshells have disappeared with them. As some of the smaller islands have been\r\nalmost denuded of their wood, and in the larger ones extensive tracts have\r\nbeen cleared for sugar cultivation, a very considerable number of species\r\nhave almost certainly been exterminated.\r\n\r\n_General Conclusions as to the Past History of the West Indian\r\nIslands._--The preceding sketch of the peculiarities of the animal life of\r\nthese islands, enables us to state, that it represents the remains of an\r\nancient fauna of decided Neotropical type, having on the whole most\r\nresemblance to that which now inhabits the Mexican sub-region. The number\r\nof peculiar genera in all classes of animals is so great in proportion to\r\nthose in common with the adjacent mainland, as to lead us to conclude that,\r\nsubsequent to the original separation from the Mexican area, a very large\r\ntract of land existed, calculated to support a rich and varied fauna, and,\r\nby the interaction of competing types, give rise to peculiar and specially\r\nmodified organisms. We have already shown that the outline of the present\r\nislands and the depths of the surrounding seas, give indications of the\r\nposition and extent of this ancient land; which not improbably occupied the\r\nspace enclosed by uniting Western Cuba with Yucatan, and Jamaica with the\r\nMosquito Coast. This land must have stretched eastward to include Anguilla,\r\nand probably northward to include the whole of the Bahamas. At one time it\r\nperhaps extended southward so as to unite Hayti with northern Venezuela,\r\nwhile Panama and Costa Pica were sunk beneath the Pacific. At this time the\r\nLesser Antilles had no existence.\r\n\r\nThe only large island of whose geology we have any detailed {79}account, is\r\nJamaica; and taking this as a type of what will probably be found in Cuba\r\nand Hayti, we must place the continental period as having occurred after\r\nthe close of the Miocene, or during some part of the Pliocene epoch, since\r\na large portion of the surface of the former island consists of beds of\r\nmarine limestone from 2,000 to 3,000 thick, believed to be of Pliocene age.\r\nAfter some time, the land between Hayti and South America subsided, and\r\nstill later that between Central America and Cuba with Jamaica; but a large\r\ntract of land remained insulated, and no doubt supported a very much richer\r\nand more varied fauna than now. We have evidence of this in extinct\r\nMammalia of large size, belonging to the peculiar South American family of\r\nthe chinchillas, which have been found in caves in the small islands of\r\nAnguilla, and which, from the character of the land-shells associated with\r\nthem, are believed to be of Pliocene or Post-pliocene age. This discovery\r\nis most interesting, and gives promise of very valuable results from the\r\nexploration of the numerous caverns that undoubtedly exist in the abundant\r\nlimestone strata of the larger islands. This extensive Antillean land,\r\nafter long continuing undivided, was at length broken up by subsidence into\r\nseveral islands; but as this alone would not account for the almost\r\ncomplete annihilation of the mammalian fauna, it seems probable that the\r\nsubsidence was continued much farther, so as greatly to reduce the size and\r\nincrease the number of the islands. This is indicated, by the extensive\r\nalluvial plains in Cuba and Hayti, and to a less extent in Jamaica; and by\r\nelevated beds of Post-pliocene marls in the latter island.\r\n\r\nThe series of changes now suggested, will account for all the main features\r\nof the Antillean fauna in its relations to that of the American continent.\r\nThere remains the affinity with Madagascar, indicated by _Solenodon_, and a\r\nfew cases of African and Asiatic affinity in insects and land-shells; but\r\nthese are far too scanty to call for any attempt at special explanation.\r\nSuch cases of remote affinity and discontinuous distribution, occur in all\r\nthe regions, and in almost every group of animals; and we look upon them\r\nalmost all, as cases of survival, under favourable {80}conditions, of once\r\nwide-spread groups. If no wild species of the genus _Equus_ were now to be\r\nfound, except in South Africa (where they are still most abundant), and in\r\nSouth Temperate America, where their fossil remains show us they did exist\r\nnot very long ago, what a strong fact it would have appeared for the\r\nadvocates of continental extensions! Yet it would have been due to no\r\nformer union of the great southern continents, but to the former extensive\r\nrange of the family or the genus to which the two isolated remnants\r\nbelonged. And if such an explanation will apply to the higher vertebrata,\r\nit is still more likely to be applicable to similar cases occurring among\r\ninsects or mollusca, the genera of which we have every reason to believe to\r\nbe usually much older than those of vertebrates. It is in these classes\r\nthat examples of widely scattered allied species most frequently occur; and\r\nthe facility with which they are diffused under favourable conditions,\r\nrenders any other explanation than that here given altogether superfluous.\r\n\r\nThe _Solenodon_ is a member of an order of Mammalia of low type\r\n(Insectivora) once very extensive and wide-spread, but which has begun to\r\ndie out, and which has left a number of curious and isolated forms thinly\r\nscattered over three-fourths of the globe. The occurrence, therefore, of an\r\nisolated remnant of this order in the Antilles is not in itself remarkable;\r\nand the fact that the remainder of the family to which the Antillean\r\nspecies belong has found a refuge in Madagascar, where it has developed\r\ninto several distinct types, does not afford the least shred of argument on\r\nwhich to found a supposed independent land connection between these two\r\nsets of islands.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Summary of the Past History of the Neotropical Region._\r\n\r\nWe have already discussed this subject, both in our account of extinct\r\nanimals, and in various parts of the present chapter. It is therefore only\r\nnecessary here, briefly to review and summarise the conclusions we have\r\narrived at.\r\n\r\nThe whole character of Neotropical zoology, whether as regards its\r\ndeficiencies or its specialities, points to a long continuance of isolation\r\nfrom the rest of the world, with a few very distant {81}periods of union\r\nwith the northern continent. The latest important separation took place by\r\nthe submergence of parts of Nicaragua and Honduras, and this separation\r\nprobably continued throughout much of the Miocene and Pliocene periods; but\r\nsome time previous to the coming on of the glacial epoch, the union between\r\nthe two continents took place which has continued to our day. Earlier\r\nsubmergences of the isthmus of Panama probably occurred, isolating Costa\r\nRica and Veragua, which then may have had a greater extension, and have\r\nthus been able to develope their rich and peculiar fauna.\r\n\r\nThe isthmus of Tehuantepec, at the south of Mexico, may, probably, also\r\nhave been submerged; thus isolating Guatemala and Yucatan, and leading to\r\nthe specialization of some of the peculiar forms that now characterise\r\nthose countries and Mexico.\r\n\r\nThe West Indian Islands have been long isolated and have varied much in\r\nextent. Originally, they probably formed part of Central America, and may\r\nhave been united with Yucatan and Honduras in one extensive tropical land.\r\nBut their separation from the continent took place at a remote period, and\r\nthey have since been broken up into numerous islands, which have probably\r\nundergone much submergence in recent times. This has led to that poverty of\r\nthe higher forms of life, combined with the remarkable speciality, which\r\nnow characterises them; while their fauna still preserves a sufficient\r\nresemblance to that of Central America to indicate its origin.\r\n\r\nThe great continent of South America, as far as we can judge from the\r\nremarkable characteristics of its fauna and the vast depths of the oceans\r\neast and west of it, has not during Tertiary, and probably not even during\r\nSecondary times, been united with any other continent, except through the\r\nintervention of North America. During some part of the Secondary epoch it\r\nprobably received the ancestral forms of its Edentates and Rodents, at a\r\ntime when these were among the highest types of Mammalia on the globe. It\r\nappears to have remained long isolated, and to have already greatly\r\ndeveloped these groups of animals, before it received, in early Tertiary\r\ntimes, the ancestors of its marmosets and monkeys, and, perhaps also, some\r\nof its peculiar forms of {82}Carnivora. Later, it received its Camelidæ,\r\npeccaries, mastodons, and large Carnivora; and later still, just before the\r\nGlacial epoch, its deer, tapir, opossums, antelopes, and horses, the two\r\nlatter having since become extinct. All this time its surface was\r\nundergoing important physical changes. What its earlier condition was we\r\ncannot conjecture, but there are clear indications that it has been broken\r\nup into at least three large masses, and probably a number of smaller ones;\r\nand these have no doubt undergone successive elevations and subsidences, so\r\nas at one time to reduce their area and separate them still more widely\r\nfrom each other, and at another period to unite them into continental\r\nmasses. The richness and varied development of the old fauna of South\r\nAmerica, as still existing, proves, however, that the country has always\r\nmaintained an extensive area; and there is reason to believe that the last\r\ngreat change has been a long continued and steady increase of its surface,\r\nresulting in the formation of the vast alluvial plains of the Amazon,\r\nOrinoko, and La Plata, and thus greatly favouring the production of that\r\nwealth of specific forms, which distinguishes South America above all other\r\nparts of our globe.\r\n\r\nThe southern temperate portion of the continent, has probably had a\r\nconsiderable southward extension in late Tertiary times; and this, as well\r\nas the comparatively recent elevation of the Andes, has given rise to some\r\ndegree of intermixture of two distinct faunas, with that proper to South\r\nTemperate America itself. The most important of these, is the considerable\r\nAustralian element that appears in the insects, and even in the reptiles\r\nand fresh-water fishes, of South Temperate America. These may be traced to\r\nseveral causes. Icebergs and icefloes, and even solid fields of ice, may,\r\nduring the Glacial epoch, have afforded many opportunities for the passage\r\nof the more cold-enduring groups; while the greater extension of southern\r\nlands and islands during the warm periods--which there is reason to believe\r\nprevailed in the southern as well as in the northern regions in Miocene\r\ntimes--would afford facilities for the passage of the reptiles and insects\r\nof more temperate zones. That no actual land-connection occurred, is proved\r\nby the total absence {83}of interchange of the mammals or land-birds of the\r\ntwo countries, no less than by the very fragmentary nature of the\r\nresemblances that do exist. The northern element consists almost wholly of\r\ninsects; and is evidently due to the migration of arctic and north\r\ntemperate forms along the ridges and plateaus of the Andes; and most likely\r\noccurred when these organisms were driven southward at successive cold or\r\nGlacial periods.\r\n\r\nA curious parallel exists between the past history and actual zoological\r\ncondition of South America and Africa. In both we see a very ancient\r\nland-area extending into the South Temperate zone, isolated at a very early\r\nperiod, and developing only a low grade of Mammalian life; chiefly\r\nEdentates and Rodents on the one, Lemurs and Insectivora in the other.\r\nLater we find an irruption into both of higher forms, including Quadrumana,\r\nwhich soon acquired a large and special development in the tropical\r\nportions of each country. Still later we have an irruption into both of\r\nnorthern forms, which spread widely over the two regions, and having become\r\nextinct in the land from whence they came, have been long held to be the\r\noriginal denizens of their adopted country. Such are the various forms of\r\nantelopes, the giraffe, the elephant, rhinoceros, and lion in Africa; while\r\nin America we have deer and peccaries, the tapir, opossums, and the puma.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, we cannot but consider that the broad outlines of the\r\nzoological history of the Neotropical region can be traced with some degree\r\nof certainty; but, owing to the absence of information as to the most\r\nimportant of the geological periods--the Miocene and Eocene--we have no\r\nclue to the character of its early fauna, or to the land connections with\r\nother countries, which may possibly have occurred in early Tertiary times.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{84}TABLES OF DISTRIBUTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn drawing up these tables, showing the distribution of the various classes\r\nof animals in the Neotropical region, the following sources of information\r\nhave been relied on, in addition to the general treatises, monographs, and\r\ncatalogues used in the compilation of the Fourth Part of this work.\r\n\r\n_Mammalia._--D'Orbigny, and Burmeister, for Brazil and La Plata; Darwin,\r\nand Cunningham, for Temperate S.

In area it is about equal to the Neotropical region.\r\nIt possesses a vast mountain range traversing its entire length from north\r\nto south, comparable with, and in fact a continuation of, the Andes,--and a\r\nsmaller range near the east coast, equally comparable with the mountains of\r\nBrazil and Guiana. These mountains supply its great river-system of the\r\nMississippi, second only to that of the Amazon; and in its vast group of\r\nfresh-water lakes or inland seas, it possesses a feature unmatched by any\r\nother region, except perhaps by the Ethiopian. It possesses every variety\r\nof climate between arctic and tropical; extensive forests and vast\r\nprairies; a greatly varied surface and a rich and beautiful flora. But\r\nthese great advantages are somewhat neutralized by other physical features.\r\nIt extends far towards the north, and there it reaches its greatest width;\r\nwhile in its southern and warmest portion it suddenly narrows. The northern\r\nmass of land causes its isothermal lines to bend southwards; and its winter\r\ntemperature especially, is far lower than at corresponding latitudes in\r\nEurope. This diminishes the available area for supporting animal life; the\r\namount and character of which must be, to a great extent, determined by the\r\nnature of the least favourable part of the year. Again, owing to the\r\nposition of its mountain ranges and the direction of prevalent winds, a\r\nlarge extent of its interior, east of the Rocky Mountains, is bare and\r\narid, and often almost desert; while the most favoured districts,--those\r\neast of the Mississippi and west of the Sierra Nevada, bear but a small\r\nproportion to its whole area. Again, we know that at a very recent period\r\ngeologically, it was subjected to a very severe Glacial epoch, which\r\nwrapped a full half of it in a mantle of ice, and exterminated a large\r\nnumber of animals which previously inhabited it. Taking all this into\r\naccount, we need not be surprised to find the Nearctic region somewhat less\r\nrich and varied in its forms of life than the Palæarctic or the Australian\r\nregions, with which alone it can fairly be compared. The wonder rather is\r\nthat it should be so little inferior to them in this respect, and that it\r\nshould possess such a variety of groups, and such a multitude of forms, in\r\nevery class of animals.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NEARCTIC REGION]\r\n\r\n{115}_Zoological characteristics of the Nearctic Region._--Temperate North\r\nAmerica possesses representatives of 26 families of Mammalia, 48 of Birds,\r\n18 of Reptiles, 11 of Amphibia, and 18 of Fresh-water Fish. The first three\r\nnumbers are considerably less than the corresponding numbers for the\r\nPalæarctic region, while the last two are greater--in the case of fishes\r\nmaterially so, a circumstance readily explained by the wonderful group of\r\nfresh-water lakes and the noble southward-flowing river system of the\r\nMississippi, to which the Palæarctic region has nothing comparable. But\r\nalthough somewhat deficient in the total number of its families, this\r\nregion possesses its full proportion of peculiar and characteristic family\r\nand generic forms. No less than 13 families or sub-families of Vertebrata\r\nare confined to it, or just enter the adjacent Neotropical region. These\r\nare,--three of mammalia, Antilocaprinæ, Saccomyidæ and Haploodontidæ; one\r\nof birds, Chamæidæ; one of reptiles, Chirotidæ; two of amphibia, Sirenidæ\r\nand Amphiumidæ; and the remaining six of fresh-water fishes. The number of\r\npeculiar or characteristic genera is perhaps more important for our\r\npurpose; and these are very considerable, as the following enumeration will\r\nshow.\r\n\r\n_Mammalia._--Of the family of moles (Talpidæ) we have 3 peculiar genera:\r\n_Condylura_, _Scapanus_, and _Scalops_, as well as the remarkable\r\n_Urotrichus_, found only in California and Japan. In the weasel family\r\n(Mustelidæ) we have _Latax_, a peculiar kind of otter; _Taxidea_, allied to\r\nthe badgers; and one of the {116}remarkable and characteristic skunks is\r\nseparated by Dr. J. E. Gray as a genus--_Spilogale_. In the American family\r\nProcyonidæ, a peculiar genus (_Bassaris_) is found in California and Texas,\r\nextending south along the mountains of Mexico and Guatemala. _Eumetopias_,\r\nand _Halicyon_, are seals confined to the west coast of North America. The\r\nBovidæ, or hollow-horned ruminants, contain three peculiar forms;\r\n_Antilocapra_, the remarkable prong-buck of the Rocky Mountains;\r\n_Aplocerus_, a goat-like antelope; and _Ovibos_, the musk-sheep, confined\r\nto Arctic America and Greenland. Among the Rodents are many peculiar\r\ngenera: _Neotoma_, _Sigmodon_, and _Fiber_, belong to the Muridæ, or rats;\r\n_Jaculus_ to the Dipodidæ, or jerboas. The very distinct family\r\n_Saccomyidæ_, or pouched rats, which have peculiar cheek pouches, or a kind\r\nof outer hairy mouth, consists of five genera all confined to this region,\r\nwith one of doubtful affinities in Trinidad and Central America. In the\r\nsquirrel family (Sciuridæ), _Cynomys_, the prairie-dogs, are peculiar; and\r\n_Tamias_, the ground squirrel, is very characteristic, though found also in\r\nNorth Asia. _Haploodon_, or sewellels, consisting of two species, forms a\r\ndistinct family; and _Erethizon_ is a peculiar form of tree porcupine\r\n(Cercolabidæ). True mice and rats of the genus _Mus_ are not indigenous to\r\nNorth America, their place being supplied by a distinct genus\r\n(_Hesperomys_), confined to the American continent.\r\n\r\n_Birds._--The genera of birds absolutely peculiar to the Nearctic region\r\nare not very numerous, because, there being no boundary but one of climate\r\nbetween it and the Neotropical region, most of its characteristic forms\r\nenter a short distance within the limits we are obliged to concede to the\r\nlatter. Owing also to the severe winter-climate of a large part of the\r\nregion (which we know is a comparatively recent phenomenon), a large\r\nproportion of its birds migrate southwards, to pass the winter in the\r\nWest-Indian islands or Mexico, some going as far as Guatemala, and a few\r\neven to Venezuela.\r\n\r\nIn our chapter on extinct animals, we have shown, that there is good reason\r\nfor believing that the existing union of North and South America is a quite\r\nrecent occurrence; and that the {117}separation was effected by an arm of\r\nthe sea across what is now Nicaragua, with perhaps another at Panama. This\r\nwould leave Mexico and Guatemala joined to North America, and forming part\r\nof the Nearctic region, although no doubt containing many Neotropical\r\nforms, which they had received during earlier continental periods; and\r\nthese countries might at other times have been made insular by a strait at\r\nthe isthmus of Tehuantepec, and have then developed some peculiar species.\r\nThe latest climatal changes have tended to restrict these Neotropical forms\r\nto those parts where the climate is really tropical; and thus Mexico has\r\nattained its present strongly marked Neotropical character, although\r\ndeficient in many of the most important groups of that region.\r\n\r\nIn view of these recent changes, it seems proper not to draw any decided\r\nline between the Nearctic and Neotropical regions, but rather to apply, in\r\nthe case of each genus, a test which will show whether it was probably\r\nderived at a comparatively recent date from one region or the other. The\r\ntest referred to, is the existence of peculiar species of the genus, in\r\nwhat are undoubtedly portions of ancient North or South America. If, for\r\nexample, all the species of a genus occur in North America, some, or even\r\nall, of them, migrating into the Neotropical region in winter, while there\r\nare _no peculiar Neotropical species_, then we must class that genus as\r\nstrictly Nearctic; for if it were Neotropical it would certainly have\r\ndeveloped _some_ peculiar resident forms. Again, even if there should be\r\none or two resident species peculiar to that part of Central America north\r\nof the ancient dividing strait, with an equal or greater number of species\r\nranging over a large part of Temperate North America, the genus must still\r\nbe considered Nearctic. Examples of the former case, are _Helminthophaga_\r\nand _Myiodioctes_, belonging to the Mniotiltidæ, or wood-warblers, which\r\nrange over _all_ Temperate North America to Canada, where _all_ the species\r\nare found, but in each case one of the species is found in South America,\r\nprobably as a winter migrant. Of the latter, are _Ammodramus_ and _Junco_\r\n(genera of finches), which range over the whole United States, but each\r\nhave one peculiar species in Guatemala. These {118}may be claimed as\r\nexclusively Nearctic genera, on the ground that Guatemala was recently\r\nNearctic; and is now really a transition territory, of which the lowlands\r\nhave been invaded and taken exclusive possession of by a Neotropical fauna,\r\nwhile the highlands are still (in part at least) occupied by Nearctic\r\nforms.\r\n\r\nIn his article on \"Birds,\" in the new edition of the \"Encyclopædia\r\nBritannica\" (now publishing), Professor Newton points out, that the number\r\nof _peculiar genera_ of Nearctic birds is much less than in each of the\r\nvarious sub-divisions of the Neotropical region; and that the total number\r\nof genera is also less, while the bulk of them are common either to the\r\nNeotropical or Palæarctic regions. This is undoubtedly the case if any\r\nfixed geographical boundary is taken; and it would thus seem that the\r\n\"Nearctic\" should, in birds, form a sub-region only. But, if we define\r\n\"Nearctic genera\" as above indicated, we find a considerable amount of\r\nspeciality, as the following list will show. The names not italicised are\r\nthose which are represented in Mexico or Guatemala by peculiar species:--\r\n\r\n\r\nLIST OF TYPICAL NEARCTIC GENERA OF LAND BIRDS.\r\n\r\n   1. _Oreoscoptes_\r\n   2. _Harporhynchus_\r\n   3. _Sialia_\r\n   4. _Chamæa_\r\n   5. _Catherpes_\r\n   6. _Salpinctus_\r\n   7. _Psaltriparus_\r\n   8. _Auriparus_\r\n   9. _Gymnokitta_\r\n  10. _Picicorvus_\r\n  11. _Mniotilta_\r\n  12. _Oporornis_\r\n  13. _Icteria_\r\n  14. _Helmintherus_\r\n  15. _Helminthophaga_\r\n  16. _Myiodioctes_\r\n  17. _Phænopepla_\r\n  18. _Xanthocephalus_\r\n  19. _Scolecophagus_\r\n  20.

But we have, besides these, a number of genera\r\nwhich we are {119}accustomed to consider as typically European, or\r\nPalæarctic, having representatives in North America; although in many cases\r\nit would be more correct to say that they are Nearctic genera, represented\r\nin Europe, since America possesses more species than Europe or North Asia.\r\nThe following is a list of genera which have as much right to be considered\r\ntypically Nearctic as Palæarctic:--\r\n\r\n   1. Regulus\r\n   2. Certhia\r\n   3. Sitta\r\n   4. Parus\r\n   5. Lophophanes\r\n   6. Lanius\r\n   7. Perisoreus\r\n   8. Pica\r\n   9. Corvus\r\n  10. _Ampelis_\r\n  11. Loxia\r\n  12.

Haliæetus\r\n\r\nThe seven genera italicized have a decided preponderance of Nearctic\r\nspecies, and have every right to be considered typically Nearctic; while\r\nthe remainder are so well represented by peculiar species, that it is quite\r\npossible many of them may have originated here, rather than in the\r\nPalæarctic region, all alike being quite foreign to the Neotropical.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, then, we have 47 in the first and 7 in the second table,\r\nmaking 54 genera which we may fairly class as typically Nearctic, out of a\r\ntotal of 168 genera of land-birds, or nearly one-third of the whole. This\r\nis an amount of peculiarity which is comparable with that of either of the\r\nless isolated regions; and, combined with the more marked and more\r\nexclusively peculiar forms in the other orders of vertebrates, fully\r\nestablishes Temperate North America as a region, distinct alike from the\r\nNeotropical and the Palæarctic.\r\n\r\n_Reptiles._--Although temperate climates are always comparatively poor in\r\nreptiles, a considerable number of genera are peculiar to the Nearctic\r\nregion. Of snakes, there are, _Conophis_, _Chilomeniscus_, _Pituophis_, and\r\n_Ischnognathus_, belonging to the Colubridæ; _Farancia_, and _Dimodes_,\r\nHomalopsidæ; _Lichanotus_, one of the Pythonidæ; _Cenchris_,\r\n_Crotalophorus_, _Uropsophorus_, and _Crotalus_, belonging to the Crotalidæ\r\nor rattlesnakes.\r\n\r\nOf Lizards, _Chirotes_, forming a peculiar family; _Ophisaurus_, {120}the\r\ncurious glass-snake, belonging to the Zonuridæ; with _Phrynosoma_ (commonly\r\ncalled horned toads), _Callisaurus_, _Uta_, _Euphryne_, _Uma_, and\r\n_Holbrookia_, genera of Iguanidæ.\r\n\r\nTestudinidæ, or Tortoises, show a great development of the genus _Emys_;\r\nwith _Aromochelys_ and _Chelydra_ as peculiar genera.\r\n\r\n_Amphibia._--In this class the Nearctic region is very rich, possessing\r\nrepresentatives of nine of the families, of which two are peculiar to the\r\nregion, and there are no less than fifteen peculiar genera. _Siren_ forms\r\nthe family Sirenidæ; _Menobranchus_ belongs to the Proteidæ; _Amphiuma_ is\r\nthe only representative of the Amphiumidæ; there are nine peculiar genera\r\nof Salamandridæ. Among the tail-less batrachians (frogs and toads) we have\r\n_Scaphiopus_, belonging to the Alytidæ; _Pseudacris_ to the Hylidæ; and\r\n_Acris_ to the Polypedatidæ.\r\n\r\n_Fresh-water Fishes._--The Nearctic region possesses no less than five\r\npeculiar family types, and twenty-four peculiar genera of this class. The\r\nfamilies are Aphredoderidæ, consisting of a single species found in the\r\nEastern States; Percopsidæ, founded on a species peculiar to Lake Superior;\r\nHeteropygii, containing two genera peculiar to the Eastern States;\r\nHyodontidæ and Amiidæ, each consisting of a single species. The genera are\r\nas follows: _Paralabrax_, found in California; _Huro_, peculiar to Lake\r\nHuron; _Pileoma_, _Boleosoma_, _Bryttus_ and _Pomotis_ in the Eastern\r\nStates--all belonging to the perch family. _Hypodelus_ and _Noturus_,\r\nbelonging to the Siluridæ. _Thaleichthys_, one of the Salmonidæ peculiar to\r\nthe Columbia river. _Moxostoma_, _Pimephales_, _Hyborhynchus_,\r\n_Rhinichthys_, in the Eastern States; _Ericymba_, _Exoglossum_,\r\n_Leucosomus_, and _Carpiodes_, more widely distributed; _Cochlognathus_, in\r\nTexas; _Mylaphorodon_ and _Orthodon_, in California; _Meda_, in the river\r\nGila; and _Acrochilus_, in the Columbia river--all belonging to the\r\nCyprinidæ. _Scaphirhynchus_, found only in the Mississippi and its\r\ntributaries, belongs to the sturgeon family (Accipenseridæ).\r\n\r\n_Summary of Nearctic Vertebrata._--The Nearctic region possesses 24\r\npeculiar genera of mammalia, 49 of birds, 21 of reptiles, and 29 of\r\nfresh-water fishes, making 123 in all. Of these 70 are mammals and\r\nland-birds, out of a total of 242 {121}genera of these groups, a proportion\r\nof about two-sevenths. This is the smallest proportion of peculiar genera\r\nwe have found in any of the regions; but many of the genera are of such\r\nisolated and exceptional forms that they constitute separate families, so\r\nthat we have no less than 12 families of vertebrata confined to the region.\r\nThe Palæarctic region has only 3 peculiar families, and even the Oriental\r\nregion only 12; so that, judged by this test, the Nearctic region is\r\nremarkably well characterized. We must also remember that, owing to the\r\nmigration of many of its peculiar forms during the Glacial period, it has\r\nrecently lost some of its speciality; and we should therefore give some\r\nweight to the many characteristic groups it possesses, which, though not\r\nquite peculiar to it, form important features in its fauna, and help to\r\nseparate it from the other regions with which it has been thought to be\r\nclosely allied. It is thus well distinguished from the Palæarctic region by\r\nits Procyonidæ, or racoons, _Hesperomys_, or vesper mice, and _Didelphys_,\r\nor opossums, among Mammalia; by its Vireonidæ, or greenlets, Mniotiltidæ,\r\nor wood-warblers, Icteridæ, or hang-nests, Tyrannidæ, or tyrant shrikes,\r\nand Trochilidæ, or humming-birds, among birds, families which, extending to\r\nits extreme northern limits must be held to be as truly characteristic of\r\nit as of the Neotropical region; by its Teidæ, Iguanidæ, and _Cinosternum_,\r\namong reptiles; and by its Siluridæ, and Lepidosteidæ, among fishes. From\r\nthe Neotropical region it is still more clearly separated, by its numerous\r\ninsectivora; by its bears; its Old World forms of ruminants; its beaver;\r\nits numerous _Arvicolæ_, or voles; its _Sciuropterus_, or flying squirrels;\r\n_Tamias_, or ground-squirrels; and _Lagomys_, or marmots, among mammals;\r\nits numerous Paridæ, or tits, and Tetraonidæ, or grouse, among birds; its\r\nTrionychidæ among reptiles; its Proteidæ, and Salamandridæ, among Amphibia;\r\nand its Gasterosteidæ, Atherinidæ, Esocidæ, Umbridæ, Accipenseridæ, and\r\nPolydontidæ, among fishes.\r\n\r\nThese characteristic features, taken in conjunction with the absolutely\r\npeculiar groups before enumerated, demonstrate that the Nearctic region\r\ncannot with propriety be combined with {122}any other. Though not very\r\nrich, and having many disadvantages of climate and of physical condition,\r\nit is yet sufficiently well characterized in its zoological features to\r\nrank as one of the well-marked primary divisions of the earth's surface.\r\n\r\nThere is one other consideration bearing on this question which should not\r\nbe lost sight of. In establishing our regions we have depended wholly upon\r\ntheir _now_ possessing a sufficient number and variety of animal forms, and\r\na fair proportion of peculiar types; but when the validity of our\r\nconclusion on these grounds is disputed, we may supplement the evidence by\r\nan appeal to the past history of the region in question. In this case we\r\nfind a remarkable support to our views. During the whole Tertiary period,\r\nNorth America was, zoologically, far more strongly contrasted with South\r\nAmerica than it is now; while, during the same long series of ages, it was\r\nalways clearly separated from the Eastern hemisphere or the Palæarctic\r\nregion by the exclusive possession of important families and numerous\r\ngenera of Mammalia, as shown by our summary of its extinct fauna in Chapter\r\nVII. Not only may we claim North America as now forming one of the great\r\nzoological regions, but as having continued to be one ever since the Eocene\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Insects._\r\n\r\nIn describing the Palæarctic and Neotropical regions, many of the\r\npeculiarities of the insect-fauna of this region have been incidentally\r\nreferred to; and as a tolerably full account of the distribution of the\r\nseveral families is given in the Fourth Part of our work (Chapter XXI.), we\r\nshall treat the subject very briefly here.\r\n\r\n_Lepidoptera._--The butterflies of the Nearctic region have lately been\r\nstudied with much assiduity, and we are now able to form some idea of their\r\nnature and extent. Nearly 500 species belonging to about 100 genera have\r\nbeen described; showing that the region, which a few years ago was thought\r\nto be very poor in species of butterflies, is really much richer than\r\nEurope, and probably about as rich as the more extensive Palæarctic region.\r\nThere is, however, very little speciality in the {123}forms. A considerable\r\nnumber of Neotropical types enter the southern States; but there are hardly\r\nany peculiar genera, except one of the Lycænidæ and perhaps a few among the\r\nHesperidæ, The most conspicuous feature of the region is its fine group of\r\nPapilios, belonging to types (_P. turnus_ and _P. troilus_) which are\r\ncharacteristically Nearctic. It is also as rich as the Palæarctic region in\r\nsome genera which we are accustomed to consider as pre-eminently European;\r\nsuch as _Argynnis_, _Melitæa_, _Grapta_, _Chionabas_, and a few others.\r\nStill, we must acknowledge, that if we formed our conclusions from the\r\nbutterflies alone, we could hardly separate the Nearctic from the\r\nPalæarctic region. This identity probably dates from the Miocene period;\r\nfor when our existing arctic regions supported a luxuriant vegetation,\r\nbutterflies would have been plentiful; and as the cold came on, these would\r\nmove southwards both in America and Europe, and, owing to the long\r\ncontinuance of the generic types of insects, would remain little modified\r\ntill now.\r\n\r\n_Coleoptera._--Only a few indications can be given of the peculiarities of\r\nthe Nearctic coleoptera. In Cicindelidæ the region possesses, besides the\r\ncosmopolite _Cicindela_, four other genera, two of which--_Amblychile_ and\r\n_Omus_--are peculiar to the West Coast and the Rocky Mountains. Of Carabidæ\r\nit possesses _Dicælus_, _Pasimachus_, _Eurytrichus_, _Sphæroderus_,\r\n_Pinacodera_, and a number of smaller genera, altogether peculiar to it;\r\n_Helluomorpha_, _Galerita_, _Callida_, and _Tetragonoderus_, in common with\r\nSouth America; and a large number of characteristic European forms.\r\n\r\nThe Lucanidæ are all of European types. The region is poor in Cetoniidæ,\r\nbut has representatives of the South American _Euphoria_, as well as of\r\nfour European genera. Of Buprestidæ it has the South American _Actenodes_;\r\na single species of the Ethiopian and Eastern _Belionota_, in California;\r\nand about a dozen other genera of European and wide distribution.\r\n\r\nAmong Longicorns it possesses fifty-nine peculiar genera, representatives\r\nof five Neotropical, and thirteen Palæarctic genera; as well as many of\r\nwider distribution. _Prionus_ is the chief representative of the Prionidæ;\r\n_Leptura_ and _Crossidius_ of the {124}Cerambycidæ; _Leptostylus_,\r\n_Liopus_, _Graphidurus_, and _Tetraopes_, of the Lamiidæ, the latter genus\r\nbeing confined to the region.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Terrestrial and Fluviatile Mollusca._\r\n\r\nThe land-shells of temperate North America almost all belong to the\r\nInoperculate or Pulmoniferous division; the Operculata being represented\r\nonly by a few species of _Helicina_ and _Truncatella_, chiefly in the\r\nSouthern States. According to Mr. Binney's recent \"Catalogue of the\r\nTerrestrial Air-breathing Mollusks of North America,\" the fauna consists of\r\nthe following genera:--_Glandina_ (6 sp.); _Macrocyclis_ (5 sp.); _Zonites_\r\n(37 sp.); _Vitrina_ (4 sp.); _Limax_ (5 sp.); _Arion_ (3 sp.); _Ariolimax_\r\n(3 sp.); _Prophysaon_ (1 sp.); _Binneia_ (1 sp.); _Hemiphillia_ (1 sp.);\r\n_Patula_ (16 sp.); _Helix_ (80); _Holospira_ (2 sp.); _Cylindrella_ (2\r\nsp.); _Macroceramus_ (2 sp.); _Bulimulus_ (8 sp.); _Cionella_ (2 sp.);\r\n_Stenogyra_ (4 sp.); _Pupa_ (19 sp.); _Strophia_ (1 sp.); _Vertigo_ (6\r\nsp.); _Liguus_ (1 sp.); _Orthalicus_ (2 sp.); _Punctum_ (1 sp.); _Succinea_\r\n(26 sp.); _Tebennophorus_ (1 sp.); _Pallifera_ (1 sp.); _Veronicella_ (2\r\nsp.).\r\n\r\nAll the larger genera range over the whole region, but the following have a\r\nmore restricted distribution; _Macrocyclis_ has only one species in the\r\nEast, the rest being Californian or Central; _Ariolimax_, _Prophysaon_,\r\n_Binneia_, and _Hemiphillia_, are confined to the Western sub-region. Lower\r\nCalifornia has affinities with Mexico, 18 species being peculiar to it, of\r\nwhich two are true _Bulimi_, a genus unknown in other parts of the region.\r\nThe Central or Rocky Mountain sub-region is chiefly characterised by six\r\npeculiar species of _Patula_. The Eastern sub-region is by far the richest,\r\nnine-tenths of the whole number of species being found in it. The Alleghany\r\nMountains form the richest portion of this sub-region, possessing nearly\r\nhalf the total number of species, and at least 24 species found nowhere\r\nelse. The southern States have also several peculiar species, but they are\r\nnot so productive as the Alleghanies. The Canadian sub-region possesses 32\r\nspecies, of which nearly half are northern forms more or less common to the\r\nwhole Arctic regions, and several of this character have spread southwards\r\nall {125}over the United States. Species of _Vitrina_, _Zonites_, _Pupa_,\r\nand _Succinea_, are found in Greenland; and Eastern Palæarctic species of\r\n_Vitrina_, _Patula_, and _Pupa_ occur in Alaska. More than 30 species of\r\nshells living in the Eastern States, are found fossil in the Post-Pliocene\r\ndeposits of the Ohio and Mississippi.\r\n\r\n_Fresh-water Shells._--North America surpasses every other part of the\r\nglobe in the number and variety of its fresh-water mollusca, both univalve\r\nand bivalve. The numbers up to 1866 were as follows:--Melaniadæ, 380\r\nspecies; Paludinidæ, 58 species; Cycladidæ, 44 species; and Unionidæ, 552\r\nspecies. The last family had, however, increased to 832 species in 1874,\r\naccording to Dr. Isaac Lea, who has made them his special study; but it is\r\nprobable that many of these are such as would be considered varieties by\r\nmost conchologists. Many of the species of _Unio_ are very large, of varied\r\nforms, and rich internal colouring, and the group forms a prominent feature\r\nof the Nearctic fauna. By far the larger proportion of the fresh-water\r\nshells inhabit the Eastern or Alleghany sub-region; and their great\r\ndevelopment is a powerful argument against any recent extensive submergence\r\nbeneath the ocean of the lowlands of North America.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Nearctic Sub-regions._\r\n\r\nThe sub-divisions of the Nearctic region, although pretty clearly indicated\r\nby physical features and peculiarities of climate and vegetation, are by no\r\nmeans so strongly marked out in their zoology as we might expect. The same\r\ngenera, as a rule, extend over the whole region; while the species of the\r\nseveral sub-regions are in most cases different. Even the vast range of the\r\nRocky Mountains has not been an effectual barrier against this wide\r\ndispersal of the same forms of life; and although some important groups are\r\nlimited by it, these are exceptions to the rule. Even now, we find fertile\r\nvalleys and plateaus of moderate elevation, penetrating the range on either\r\nside; and both to the north and south there are passes which can be freely\r\ntraversed by most animals during the summer. Previous to the glacial epoch\r\nthere was probably a warm period, when every part of the range supported an\r\nabundant and varied {126}fauna, which, when the cold period arrived, would\r\ndescend to the lowlands, and people the country to the east, west, and\r\nsouth, with similar forms of life.\r\n\r\nThe first, and most important sub-division we can make, consists of the\r\nEastern United States, extending across the Mississippi and the more\r\nfertile prairies, to about the 100°th. meridian of west longitude, where\r\nthe arid and almost desert country commences. Southwards, the boundary\r\nbends towards the coast, near the line of the Brazos or Colorado rivers. To\r\nthe north the limits are undefined; but as a considerable number of species\r\nand genera occur in the United States but not in Canada, it will be\r\nconvenient to draw the line somewhere near the boundary of the two\r\ncountries, except that the district between lakes Huron and Ontario, and\r\nprobably Nova Scotia, may be included in the present sub-region. As far\r\nwest as the Mississippi, this was originally a vast forest country; and it\r\nis still well wooded, and clothed with a varied and luxuriant vegetation.\r\n\r\nThe next, or Central sub-region, consists of the dry, elevated, and often\r\narid district of the Rocky Mountains, with its great plateaus, and the\r\nbarren plains of its eastern slope; extending northwards to near the\r\ncommencement of the great forests north of the Saskatchewan, and southward\r\nto the Rio Grande del Norte, the Gulf of California, and to Cape St. Lucas,\r\nas shown on our maps. This sub-region is of an essentially desert\r\ncharacter, although the higher valleys of the Rocky Mountains are often\r\nwell wooded, and in these are found some northern and some western types.\r\n\r\nThe third, or Californian sub-region, is small, but very luxuriant,\r\noccupying the comparatively narrow strip of country between the Sierra\r\nNevada and the Pacific. To the north it may include Vancouver's Island and\r\nthe southern part of British Columbia, while to the south it extends to the\r\nhead of the Gulf of California.\r\n\r\nThe fourth division, comprises the remainder of North America; and is a\r\ncountry of pine forests, and of barren wastes towards the Arctic Ocean. It\r\nhas fewer peculiar species to characterise it than any other, but it\r\npossesses several characteristic arctic {127}forms, while many of those\r\npeculiar to the south are absent; so that it is a very convenient, if it\r\nshould not be considered an altogether natural, sub-region.\r\n\r\nWe will now give an outline of the most important zoological features of\r\neach of these divisions, taking them in the order in which they are\r\narranged in the Fourth Part of this work. California comes first, as it has\r\nsome tropical forms not found elsewhere, and thus forms a transition from\r\nthe Neotropical region.\r\n\r\n\r\n_I. The Western or Californian Sub-region._\r\n\r\nThis small district possesses a fruitful soil and a highly favourable\r\nclimate, and is, in proportion to its extent, perhaps the richest portion\r\nof the continent, both zoologically and botanically. Its winters are far\r\nmilder than those of the Eastern States in corresponding latitudes; and\r\nthis, perhaps, has enabled it to support several tropical forms which give\r\na special character to its fauna. It is here only, in the whole region,\r\nthat bats of the families Phyllostomidæ and Noctilionidæ, and a serpent of\r\nthe tropical family, Pythonidæ, are found, as well as several Neotropical\r\nforms of birds and reptiles.\r\n\r\n_Mammalia._--The following genera are not found in any other part of the\r\nNearctic region. _Macrotus_ (Phyllostomidæ), one species in California;\r\n_Antrozous_ (Vespertilionidæ), one species on the West Coast; _Urotrichus_\r\n(Talpidæ) one species in British Columbia; sub-genus _Nesorex_ (Soricidæ),\r\none species in Oregon; _Bassaris_ (Procyonidæ), California; _Enhydra_\r\n(Mustelidæ), Pacific Coast; _Morunga_ (Phocidæ), California; _Haploodon_\r\n(Haploodontidæ) a rat-like animal, allied to the beavers and marmots, and\r\nconstituting a peculiar family found only in California and British\r\nColumbia. The following characteristic Nearctic forms also extend into this\r\nsub-region:--_Taxidea_, _Procyon_, _Didelphys_, _Sciuropterus_, _Tamias_,\r\n_Spermophilus_, _Dipodomys_, _Perognathus_, _Jaculus_.\r\n\r\n_Birds._--Few genera of birds are quite peculiar to this sub-region, since\r\nmost of the Western forms extend into the central district, yet it has a\r\nfew. _Glaucidium_, a genus of Owls, is confined {128}(in the Nearctic\r\nregion) to California; _Chamæa_, a singular form allied to the wrens, and\r\nforming a distinct family, is quite peculiar; _Geococcyx_, a Neotropical\r\nform of cuckoo, extends to California and Southern Texas. The following\r\ngenera are very characteristic of the sub-region, and some of them almost\r\nconfined to it: _Myiadestes_ (Sylviidæ); _Psaltriparus_ (Paridæ);\r\n_Cyanocitta_, _Picicorvus_ (Corvidæ); _Hesperiphona_, _Peucæa_,\r\n_Chondestes_ (Fringillidæ); _Selasphorus_, _Atthis_ (Trochilidæ);\r\n_Columba_, _Melopelia_ (Columbidæ); _Oreortyx_ (Tetraonidæ).\r\n\r\n_Reptiles._--The following genera are not found in any other part of the\r\nNearctic region: _Charina_ (Tortricidæ); _Lichanotus_ (Pythonidæ);\r\n_Gerrhonotus_ (Zonuridæ); _Phyllodactylus_ (Geckotidæ); _Anolius_ and\r\n_Tropidolepis_ (Iguanidæ). _Sceloporus_ (Iguanidæ) is only found elsewhere\r\nin Florida. All the larger North American groups of lizards and snakes are\r\nalso represented here; but in tortoises it is deficient, owing to the\r\nabsence of lakes and large rivers.\r\n\r\n_Amphibia._--California possesses two genera of Salamandridæ, _Aneides_ and\r\n_Heredia_, which do not extend to the other sub-regions.\r\n\r\n_Fresh-water Fish._--There are two or three peculiar genera of Cyprinidæ,\r\nbut the sub-region is comparatively poor in this group.\r\n\r\n_Plate XVIII. Illustrative of the Zoology of California and the Rocky\r\nMountains._--We have chosen for the subject of this illustration, the\r\npeculiar Birds of the Western mountains. The two birds in the foreground\r\nare a species of grouse (_Pediocætes Columbianus_), entirely confined to\r\nthis sub-region; while the only other species of the genus is found in the\r\nprairies north and west of Wisconsin, so that the group is peculiar to\r\nnorthern and western America. The crested birds in the middle of the\r\npicture (_Oreortyx picta_), are partridges, belonging to the American\r\nsub-family Odontophorinæ. This is the only species of the genus which is\r\nconfined to California and Oregon. The bird at the top is the blue crow\r\n(_Gymnokitta cyanocephala_), confined to the Rocky Mountains and Sierra\r\nNevada from New Mexico and Arizona northwards, and more properly belonging\r\nto the Central sub-region. It is allied to the European nutcracker; but\r\naccording to the American ornithologist, Dr. Coues, has also resemblances\r\nto the jays, and certainly forms a distinct genus. The grizzly bear (_Ursus\r\nferox_) in the background, is one of the characteristic animals of the\r\nCalifornian highlands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlate XVIII.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nSCENE IN CALIFORNIA, WITH SOME CHARACTERISTIC BIRDS.\r\n\r\n\r\n{129}_II. The Central, or Rocky Mountain Sub-region._\r\n\r\nThis extensive district is, for the greater part of its extent, from 2,000\r\nto 5,000 feet above the sea, and is excessively arid; and, except in the\r\nimmediate vicinity of streams and on some of the higher slopes of the\r\nmountains, is almost wholly treeless. Its zoology is therefore peculiar.\r\nMany of the most characteristic genera and families of the Eastern States\r\nare absent; while a number of curious desert and alpine forms give it a\r\ncharacter of its own, and render it very interesting to the naturalist.\r\n\r\n_Mammalia._--The remarkable prong-horned antelope (_Antilocapra_), the\r\nmountain goat (_Aplocerus_), the mountain sheep or bighorn (_Ovis\r\nmontana_), and the prairie-dog (_Cynomys_), one of the Rodentia, are\r\npeculiar to this sub-region; while the family of the Saccomyidæ, or pouched\r\nrats, is represented by many forms and is very characteristic. Here is also\r\nthe chief home of the bison. The glutton (_Gulo_) and marmot (_Lagomys_)\r\nenter it from the north; while it has the racoon (_Procyon_), flying\r\nsquirrel (_Sciuropterus_), ground squirrel (_Tamias_), pouched marmot\r\n(_Spermophilus_) and jumping mouse (_Jaculus_) in common with the countries\r\neast or west of it.\r\n\r\n_Plate XIX. Illustrative of the Zoology of the Central Plains or\r\nPrairies._--We here introduce four of the most characteristic mammalia of\r\nthe great American plains or prairies, three of them being types confined\r\nto North America. The graceful animals on the left are the prong-horned\r\nantelopes (_Antilocapra americana_), whose small horns, though hollow like\r\nthose of the antelopes, are shed annually like those of the deer. To the\r\nright we have the prairie-dogs of the trappers (_Cynomys ludovicianus_)\r\nwhich, as will be easily seen, are rodents, and allied to the marmots of\r\nthe European Alps. Their burrows are numerous on the prairies, and the\r\nmanner in which they perch {130}themselves on little mounds and gaze on\r\nintruders, is noticed by all travellers. On the left, in the foreground, is\r\none of the extraordinary pouched rats of America (_Geomys bursarius_).\r\nThese are burrowing animals, feeding on roots; and the mouth is, as it\r\nwere, double, the outer portion very wide and hairy, behind which is the\r\nsmall inner mouth. Its use may be to keep out the earth from the mouth\r\nwhile the animal is gnawing roots. A mouth so constructed is found in no\r\nother animals but in these North American rats. In the distance is a herd\r\nof bisons (_Bison americanus_), the typical beast of the prairies.\r\n\r\n_Birds._--This sub-region has many peculiar forms of birds, both residents,\r\nand migrants from the south or north. Among the peculiar resident species\r\nwe may probably reckon a dipper, (_Cinclus_); _Salpinctes_, one of the\r\nwrens; _Poospiza_, _Calamospiza_, genera of finches; _Picicorvus_,\r\n_Gymnokitta_, genera of the crow family; _Centrocercus_ and _Pediocætes_,\r\ngenera of grouse. As winter migrants from the north it has _Leucosticte_\r\nand _Plectrophanes_, genera of finches; _Perisoreus_, a genus of the crow\r\nfamily; _Picoides_, the Arctic woodpecker; and _Lagopus_, ptarmigan. Its\r\nsummer migrants, many of which may be resident in the warmer districts, are\r\nmore numerous. Such are, _Oreoscoptes_, a genus of thrushes;\r\n_Campylorhynchus_ and _Catherpes_, wrens; _Paroides_, one of the tits;\r\n_Phænopepla_, allied to the waxwing; _Embernagra_ and _Spermophila_, genera\r\nof finches; _Pyrocephalus_, one of the tyrant shrikes; _Callipepla_ and\r\n_Cyrtonyx_, American partridges. Besides these, the more widely spread\r\ngenera, _Harporhynchus_, _Lophophanes_, _Carpodacus_, _Spizella_, and\r\n_Cyanocitta_, are characteristic of the central district, and two genera of\r\nhumming-birds--_Atthis_ and _Selasphorus_--only occur here and in\r\nCalifornia. Prof. Baird notes 40 genera of birds which are represented by\r\ndistinct allied species in the western, central, and eastern divisions of\r\nthe United States, corresponding to our sub-regions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlate XIX.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTHE AMERICAN PRAIRIES, WITH CHARACTERISTIC MAMMALIA.\r\n\r\n{131}It is a curious fact that the birds of this sub-region should extend\r\nacross the Gulf of California, and that Cape St. Lucas, at the southern\r\nextremity of the peninsula, should be decidedly more \"Central\" than\r\n\"Californian\" in its ornithology. Prof. Baird says, that its fauna is\r\nalmost identical with that of the Gila River, and has hardly any relation\r\nto that of Upper California. It possesses a considerable number (about\r\ntwenty) of peculiar species of birds, but all belong to genera\r\ncharacteristic of the present sub-region; and there is no resemblance to\r\nthe birds of Mazatlan, just across the gulf in the Neotropical region.\r\n\r\n_Reptiles, Amphibia, and Fishes._--A large number of snakes and lizards\r\ninhabit this sub-region, but they have not yet been classified with\r\nsufficient precision to enable us to make much use of them. Among lizards,\r\nIguanidæ, Geckotidæ, Scincidæ, and Zonuridæ, appear to be numerous; and\r\nmany new genera of doubtful value have been described. Among snakes,\r\nCalamariidæ, Colubridæ, and Crotalidæ are represented. Among Amphibia,\r\n_Siredon_, one of the Proteidæ, is peculiar. The rivers and lakes of the\r\nGreat Central Basin, and the Colorado River, contain many peculiar forms of\r\nCyprinidæ.\r\n\r\n\r\n_III. The Eastern or Alleghany Sub-region._\r\n\r\nThis sub-region contains examples of all that is most characteristic of\r\nNearctic zoology. It is for the most part an undulating or mountainous\r\nforest-clad country, with a warm or temperate climate, but somewhat extreme\r\nin character, and everywhere abounding in animal and vegetable life. To the\r\nwest, across the Mississippi, the country becomes more open, gradually\r\nrises, becomes much drier, and at length merges into the arid plains of the\r\ncentral sub-region. To the south, in Georgia, Florida, and Louisiana, a\r\nsub-tropical climate prevails, and winter is almost unknown. To the north,\r\nin Michigan and New England, the winters are very severe, and streams and\r\nlakes are frozen for months together. These different climates, however,\r\nproduce little effect on the forms of animal life; the species to some\r\nextent change as we go from north to south, but the same types everywhere\r\nprevail. This portion of the United States, having been longest inhabited\r\nby Europeans, has been more thoroughly explored than other parts of North\r\nAmerica; and to this more complete knowledge its superior zoological\r\nrichness {132}may be to some extent due; but there can be little doubt that\r\nit is also positively, and not merely relatively, more productive in varied\r\nforms of animal life than either of the other sub-regions.\r\n\r\n_Mammalia._--There seems to be only one genus absolutely peculiar to this\r\nsub-region--the very remarkable _Condylura_, or star-nosed mole, only found\r\nfrom Pennsylvania to Nova Scotia, and as far as about 94° west longitude.\r\nIt also has opossums (_Didelphys_) in common with California, and three out\r\nof four species of _Scalops_, a genus of moles; as well as the skunk\r\n(_Mephitis_), American badger (_Taxidea_), racoon (_Procyon_), pouched rat\r\n(_Geomys_), beaver rat (_Fiber_), jumping mouse (_Jaculus_), tree porcupine\r\n(_Erethizon_), and other characteristic Nearctic forms.\r\n\r\n_Birds._--The birds of this sub-region have been carefully studied by\r\nAmerican naturalists, and many interesting facts ascertained as to their\r\ndistribution and migrations. About 120 species of birds are peculiar to the\r\neast coast of the United States, but only about 30 of these are residents\r\nall the year round in any part of it; the bird population being essentially\r\na migratory one, coming from the north in winter and the south in summer.\r\nThe largest number of species seems to be congregated in the district of\r\nthe Alleghany mountains. A considerable proportion of the passerine birds\r\nwinter in Central America and the West Indian Islands, and go to the Middle\r\nStates or Canada to breed; so that even the luxuriant Southern States do\r\nnot possess many birds which may be called permanent residents. Thus, in\r\nEast Pennsylvania there are only 52, and in the district of Columbia 54\r\nspecies, found all the year round, out of about 130 which breed in these\r\nlocalities; very much below the number which permanently reside in Great\r\nBritain.\r\n\r\nThis sub-region is well characterised by its almost exclusive possession of\r\n_Ectopistes_, the celebrated passenger pigeon, whose enormous flocks and\r\nbreeding places have been so often described; and _Cupidonia_, a remarkable\r\ngenus of grouse. The only Nearctic parrot, _Conurus carolinensis_, is found\r\nin the Southern States; as well as _Crotophaga_, a South American genus\r\nusually associated with the cuckoos. _Helmintherus_ and {133}_Oporornis_,\r\ngenera of wood-warblers, may be considered to be peculiar to this\r\nsub-region, since in each case only one of the two species migrates as far\r\nas Central America; while two other genera of the same family, _Siurus_ and\r\n_Setophaga_, as well as the finch genus, _Euspiza_, do not extend to either\r\nof the western sub-regions. _Parus_, a genus of tits, comes into the\r\ndistrict from the north; _Otocorys_, an alpine lark, and _Coturniculus_, an\r\nAmerican finch, from the west; and such characteristic Nearctic genera as\r\n_Antrostomus_ (the whip-poor-will goatsuckers); _Helminthophaga_,\r\n_Dendræca_, and _Myiodioctes_ (wood-warblers); _Vireo_ (greenlets);\r\n_Dolichonyx_ (rice-bird); _Quiscalus_ (troupial); _Meleagris_ (turkey); and\r\n_Ortyx_ (American partridge), are wide-spread and abundant. In Mr. J. A.\r\nAllen's elaborate and interesting paper on the birds of eastern North\r\nAmerica, he enumerates 32 species which breed only in the more temperate\r\nportions of this province, and may therefore be considered to be especially\r\ncharacteristic of it. These belong to the following genera:--_Turdus_,\r\n_Galeoscoptes_, _Harporhynchus_, _Sialia_, _Dendræca_, _Wilsonia_,\r\n_Pyranga_, _Vireo_, _Lanivireo_, _Lophophanes_, _Coturniculus_,\r\n_Ammodromus_, _Spizella_, _Euspiza_, _Hedymeles_, _Cyanospiza_, _Pipilo_,\r\n_Cardinalis_, _Icterus_, _Corvus_, _Centurus_, _Melanerpes_, _Antrostomus_,\r\n_Coccyzus_, _Ortyx_, and _Cupidonia_.\r\n\r\n_Reptiles._--In this class the Eastern States are rich, possessing many\r\npeculiar forms not found in other parts of the region. Among snakes it has\r\nthe genera _Farancia_ and _Dimodes_ belonging to the fresh-water snakes\r\n(Homalopsidæ); the South American genus _Elaps_; and 3 genera of\r\nrattlesnakes, _Cenchris_, _Crotalophorus_, and _Crotalus_. The following\r\ngenera of snakes are said to occur in the State of New York:--_Coluber_,\r\n_Tropidonotus_, _Leptophis_, _Calamaria_, _Heterodon_, _Trigonocephalus_,\r\n_Crotalus_, _Psammophis_, _Helicops_, _Rhinostoma_, _Pituophis_, and\r\n_Elaps_.\r\n\r\nAmong lizards, _Chirotes_, forming a peculiar family of Amphisbenians,\r\ninhabits Missouri and Mexico; while the remarkable glass-snake,\r\n_Ophisaurus_, belonging to the family Zonuridæ, is peculiar to the Southern\r\nStates; and the South American _Sphærodactylus_, one of the gecko family,\r\nreaches Florida. Other genera which extend as far north as the State of New\r\n{134}York are, _Scincus_, _Tropidolepis_, _Plestiodon_, _Lygosoma_,\r\n_Ameiva_, and _Phrynosoma_.\r\n\r\nTortoises, especially the fresh-water kind, are very abundant; and the\r\ngenera _Aromochelys_, _Chelydra_, _Terrapene_, and _Trionyx_, are nearly,\r\nif not quite, confined to this division of the region.\r\n\r\n_Amphibia._--Almost all the remarkable forms of Urodela, or tailed\r\nbatrachians, peculiar to the region are found here only; such as _Siren_\r\nand _Pseudobranchus_, constituting the family Sirenidæ; _Menobranchus_,\r\nallied to the _Proteus_ of Europe; _Amphiuma_, an eel-like creature with\r\nfour rudimentary feet, constituting the family Amphiumidæ; _Notopthalmus_,\r\n_Desmognathus_, and _Menopoma_, belonging to the Salamandridæ; together\r\nwith several other genera of wider range. Of Anura, or tail-less\r\nbatrachians, there are no peculiar genera, but the Neotropical genus of\r\ntoads, _Engystoma_, extends as far as South Carolina.\r\n\r\n_Fishes._--Owing to its possession of the Mississippi and the great lakes,\r\nalmost all the peculiar forms of North American fishes are confined to this\r\nsub-region. Such are _Perca_, _Pileoma_, _Huro_, _Bryttus_, and _Pomotis_\r\n(Percidæ); the families Aphredoderidæ and Percopsidæ; several genera of\r\nCyprinodontidæ and Cyprinidæ; and the family Polydontidæ.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Islands of the Alleghany Sub-region._\r\n\r\n_The Bermudas._--These islands, situated in the Atlantic, about 700 miles\r\nfrom the coast of Carolina, are chiefly interesting for the proof they\r\nafford of the power of a great variety of birds to cross so wide an extent\r\nof ocean. There are only 6 or 8 species of birds which are permanent\r\nresidents on the islands, all common North American species; while no less\r\nthan 140 species have been recorded as visiting them. Most of these are\r\nstragglers, many only noticed once; others appear frequently and in great\r\nnumbers, but very few, perhaps not a dozen, come every year, and can be\r\nconsidered regular migrants. The permanent residents are, a greenlet\r\n(_Vireo noveboracensis)_, the catbird (_Galeoscoptes carolinensis_), the\r\nblue bird (_Sialia sialis_), the cardinal (_Cardinalis virginianus_), the\r\nAmerican crow (_Corvus {135}americanus_), and the ground dove (_Chamæpelia\r\npasserina_). The most regular visitants are a kingfisher (_Ceryle alcyon_),\r\nthe wood-wagtail (_Siurus noveboracensis_), the rice-bird (_Dolichonyx\r\noryzivorus_), and a moorhen (_Gallinula galeata_). Besides the American\r\nspecies, four European birds have been taken at the Bermudas: _Saxicola\r\noenanthe_, _Alauda arvensis_ (perhaps introduced), _Crex pratensis_, and\r\n_Scolopax gallinago_.\r\n\r\nA common American lizard, _Plestiodon longirostris_, is the only land\r\nreptile found on the islands.\r\n\r\n\r\n_IV. The Sub-Arctic or Canadian Sub-region._\r\n\r\nThis sub-region serves to connect together the other three, since they all\r\nmerge gradually into it; while to the north it passes into the circumpolar\r\nzone which is common to the Palæarctic and Nearctic regions. The greater\r\nportion of it is an extensive forest-district, mostly of coniferæ; and\r\nwhere these cease towards the north, barren wastes extend to the polar\r\nocean. It possesses several northern or arctic forms of Mammalia, such as\r\nthe glutton, lemming, reindeer, and elk, which barely enter the more\r\nsouthern sub-regions; as well as the polar bear and arctic fox; but it also\r\nhas some peculiar forms, and many of the most characteristic Nearctic\r\ntypes. The remarkable musk-sheep (_Ovibos_) is confined to this sub-region,\r\nranging over a considerable extent of country north of the forests, as well\r\nas Greenland. It has been extinct in Europe and Asia since the\r\nPost-pliocene epoch. Such purely Nearctic genera as _Procyon_, _Latax_,\r\n_Erethizon_, _Jaculus_, _Fiber_, _Thomomys_, and _Hesperomys_, abound, many\r\nof them ranging to the shores of Hudson's Bay and the barren wastes of\r\nnorthern Labrador. Others, such as _Blarina_, _Condylura_, and _Mephitis_,\r\nare found only in Nova Scotia and various parts of Canada. About 20 species\r\nof Mammalia seem to be peculiar to this sub-region.\r\n\r\n_Plate XX. Illustrating the Zoology of Canada._--We have here a group of\r\nMammalia characteristic of Canada and the colder parts of the United\r\nStates. Conspicuous in the foreground is the skunk (_Mephitis mephitica_),\r\nbelonging to a genus of the weasel family found only in America. This\r\nanimal is {136}celebrated for its power of ejecting a terribly offensive\r\nliquid, the odour of which is almost intolerable. The skunks are nocturnal\r\nanimals, and are generally marked, as in the species represented, with\r\nconspicuous bands and patches of white. This enables them to be easily seen\r\nat night, and thus serves to warn larger animals not to attack them. To the\r\nleft is the curious little jumping mouse (_Jaculus hudsonius_), the\r\nAmerican representative of the Palæarctic jerboa. Climbing up a tree on the\r\nleft is the tree porcupine (_Erethizon dorsatus_), belonging to the family\r\nCercolabidæ, which represents, on the American continent, the porcupines of\r\nthe Old World. In the background is the elk or moose (_Alces americanus_),\r\nperhaps identical with the European elk, and the most striking inhabitant\r\nof the northern forests of America, as the bison is of the prairies.\r\n\r\n_Birds._--Although the Canadian sub-region possesses very few resident\r\nbirds, the numbers which breed in it are perhaps greater than in the other\r\nsub-regions, because a large number of circumpolar species are found here\r\nexclusively. From a comparison of Mr. Allen's tables it appears, that more\r\nthan 200 species are regular migrants to Canada in the breeding season, and\r\nnearly half of these are land-birds. Among them are to be found a\r\nconsiderable number of genera of the American families Tyrannidæ and\r\nMniotiltidæ, as well as the American genera _Sialia_, _Progne_, _Vireo_,\r\n_Cistothorus_, _Junco_, _Pipilo_, _Zonotrichia_, _Spizella_, _Melospiza_,\r\n_Molothrus_, _Agelæus_, _Cyanura_, _Sphyrapicus_, and many others; so that\r\nthe ornithology of these northern regions is still mainly Nearctic in\r\ncharacter. Besides these, it has such specially northern forms as _Surnia_\r\n(Strigidæ); _Picoides_ (Picidæ); _Pinicola_ (Fringillidæ); as well as\r\n_Leucosticte_, _Plectrophanes_, _Perisoreus_, and _Lagopus_, which extend\r\nfurther south, especially in the middle sub-region. No less than 212\r\nspecies of birds have been collected in the new United States territory of\r\nAlaska (formerly Russian America), where a humming-bird (_Selasphorus\r\nrufus_) breeds. The great majority of these are typically American,\r\nincluding such forms as _Colaptes_, _Helminthophaga_, _Siurus_, _Dendræca_,\r\n_Myiodioctes_, _Passerculus_, _Zonotrichia_, _Junco_, _Spizella_,\r\n_Melospizpa_, _Passerella_, _Scoleophagas_, _Pediocetes_, and _Bonasa_;\r\ntogether with many northern birds common to both continents. Yet a few\r\nPalæarctic forms, not known in other parts of the sub-region, appear here.\r\nThese are _Budytes flava_, _Phylloscopus kennicottii_, and _Pyrrhula\r\ncoccinea_, all belonging to genera not occurring elsewhere in North\r\nAmerica. Considering the proximity of the district to North-east Asia, and\r\nthe high probability that there was an actual land connection at, and south\r\nof, Behring's Straits, in late Tertiary times, it is somewhat remarkable\r\nthat the admixture of Palæarctic and Nearctic groups is not greater than it\r\nis. The Palæarctic element, however, forms so small apportion of the whole\r\nfauna, that it may be satisfactorily accounted for by the establishment of\r\nimmigrants since the Glacial period. The great interest felt by\r\nornithologists in the discovery of the three genera above-named, with a\r\nwren allied to a European species, is an indication that the faunas even of\r\nthe northern parts of the Nearctic and Palæarctic regions are, as regards\r\nbirds, radically distinct. It may be mentioned that the birds of the\r\nAleutian Isles are also, so far as known, almost wholly Nearctic. The\r\nnumber of land-birds known from Alaska is 77; and from the Aleutian Isles\r\n16 species, all of which, except one, are North American.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlate XX.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nA CANADIAN FOREST, WITH CHARACTERISTIC MAMMALIA.\r\n\r\n{137}_Reptiles._--These are comparatively few and unimportant. There are\r\nhowever five snakes and three tortoises which are limited to Canada proper;\r\nwhile further north there are only Amphibia, represented by frogs and\r\ntoads, and a salamander of the genus _Plethodon_.\r\n\r\n_Fishes._--Most of the groups of fresh-water fish of the Nearctic region\r\nare represented here, especially those of the perch, salmon, and pike\r\nfamilies; but there seem to be few or no peculiar genera.\r\n\r\n_Insects._--These are far less numerous than in the more temperate\r\ndistricts, but are still tolerably abundant. In Canada there are 53 species\r\nof butterflies, viz., Papilionidæ, 4; Pieridæ, 2; Nymphalidæ, 21; Satyridæ,\r\n3; Lycænidæ 16, and Hesperidæ 7. Most of these are, no doubt, found chiefly\r\nin the southern parts of Canada. That Coleoptera are pretty numerous is\r\nshown, by more than 800 species having been collected on the {138}shores of\r\nLake Superior; 177 being Geodephaga and 39 Longicorns.\r\n\r\n_Greenland._--This great arctic island must be considered as belonging to\r\nthe Nearctic region, since of its six land mammals, three are exclusively\r\nAmerican (_Myodes torquatus_, _Lepus glacialis_, and _Ovibos moschatus_),\r\nwhile the other three (_Vulpes lagopus_, _Ursus maritimus_, and _Rangifer\r\ntarandus_) are circumpolar. Only fourteen land-birds are either resident\r\nin, or regular migrants to the country; and of these two are European\r\n(_Haliæetus albicilla_, and _Falco peregrinus_), while three are American\r\n(_Anthus ludovicianus_, _Zonotrichia leucophrys_, and _Lagopus rupestris_),\r\nthe rest being arctic species common to both continents. The waders and\r\naquatics (49 in number) are nearly equally divided between both continents;\r\nbut the land-birds which visit Greenland as stragglers are mostly American.\r\nYet although the Nearctic element somewhat preponderates, Greenland really\r\nbelongs to that circumpolar debateable land, which is common to the two\r\nNorth Temperate regions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Concluding remarks._--We have already discussed pretty fully, though\r\nsomewhat incidentally, the status and relations of the Nearctic region;\r\nfirst in our chapter on Zoological regions, then in our review of extinct\r\nfaunas, and lastly in the earlier part of this chapter. It will not\r\ntherefore be necessary to go further into the question here; but we shall,\r\nin our next chapter, give a brief summary of the general conclusions we\r\nhave reached as to the past history and mutual zoological relations of all\r\nthe great divisions of the earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n{139}TABLES OF DISTRIBUTION.\r\n\r\nIn drawing up these tables, showing the distribution of various classes of\r\nanimals in the Nearctic region, the following sources of information have\r\nbeen chiefly relied on, in addition to the general treatises, monographs,\r\nand catalogues used in the compilation of the 4th Part of this work.\r\n\r\n_Mammalia._--Professor Baird's Catalogue; Allen's List of the Bats; Mr.\r\nLord's List for British Columbia; Brown, for Greenland; Packard for\r\nLabrador.\r\n\r\n_Birds._--Baird, Cassin, and Allen's Lists for United States; Richardson's\r\nFauna Boreali Americana; Jones, for Bermudas; and papers by Brown, Coues,\r\nLord, Packard, Dall, and Professor Newton.\r\n\r\n\r\n{140}TABLE I.\r\n\r\n_FAMILIES OF ANIMALS INHABITING THE NEARCTIC REGION._\r\n\r\nEXPLANATION.\r\n\r\n  Names in _italics_ show the families which are peculiar to the region.\r\n\r\n  Names inclosed thus (......) show families which barely enter the region,\r\n  and are not considered properly to belong to it.\r\n\r\n  Numbers correspond to the series of numbers to the families in Part IV.\r\n\r\n  ---------------------+-------------------+-------------------------------\r\n                       | Sub-regions       |\r\n                       | 1=California.     |\r\n    Order and Family   | 2=Rocky Mntns.    |   Range beyond the Region.\r\n                       | 3=Alleghanies.    |\r\n                       | 4=Canada.         |\r\n  ---------------------+----+----+----+----+-------------------------------\r\n                       | 1. | 2. | 3. | 4. |\r\n  ---------------------+----+----+----+----+-------------------------------\r\n                       |    |    |    |    |\r\n  MAMMALIA.            |    |    |    |    |\r\n  CHIROPTERA.          |    |    |    |    |\r\n  10.

In going back through the long series\r\nof the Tertiary formations, in Europe, Asia, and North America, we find a\r\ncontinuous succession of vertebrate forms, including all the highest types\r\nnow existing or that have existed on the earth. These extinct animals\r\ncomprise ancestors or forerunners of all the chief forms now living in the\r\nNorthern Hemisphere; and as we go back farther and farther into the past,\r\nwe meet with ancestral forms of those types also, which are now either\r\nconfined to, or specially characteristic of, the land masses of the\r\nSouthern Hemisphere. Not only do we find that elephants, and rhinoceroses,\r\nand hippopotami, were once far more abundant in Europe than they are now in\r\nthe tropics, but we also find that the apes of West Africa and Malaya, the\r\nlemurs of Madagascar, the Edentata of Africa and South America, and the\r\n{155}Marsupials of America and Australia, were all represented in Europe\r\n(and probably also in North America) during the earlier part of the\r\nTertiary epoch. These facts, taken in their entirety, lead us to conclude\r\nthat, during the whole of the Tertiary and perhaps during much of the\r\nSecondary periods, the great land masses of the earth were, as now,\r\nsituated in the Northern Hemisphere; and that here alone were developed the\r\nsuccessive types of vertebrata from the lowest to the highest. In the\r\nSouthern Hemisphere there appear to have been three considerable and very\r\nancient land masses, varying in extent from time to time, but always\r\nkeeping distinct from each other, and represented, more or less completely,\r\nby Australia, South Africa, and South America of our time. Into these\r\nflowed successive waves of life, as they each in turn became temporarily\r\nunited with some part of the northern land. Australia appears to have had\r\nbut one such union, perhaps during the middle or latter part of the\r\nSecondary epoch, when it received the ancestors of its Monotremata and\r\nMarsupials, which it has since developed into a great variety of forms. The\r\nSouth African and South American lands, on the other hand, appear each to\r\nhave had several successive unions and separations, allowing first of the\r\ninflux of low forms only (Edentata, Insectivora and Lemurs); subsequently\r\nof Rodents and small Carnivora, and, latest of all, of the higher types of\r\nPrimates, Carnivora and Ungulata.\r\n\r\nDuring the whole of the Tertiary period, at least, the Northern Hemisphere\r\nappears to have been divided, as now, into an Eastern and a Western\r\ncontinent; always approximating and sometimes united towards the north, and\r\nthen admitting of much interchange of their respective faunas; but on the\r\nwhole keeping distinct, and each developing its own special family and\r\ngeneric types, of equally high grade, and generally belonging to the same\r\nOrders. During the Eocene and Miocene periods, the distinction of the\r\nPalæarctic and Nearctic regions was better marked than it is now; as is\r\nshown by the floras no less than by the faunas of those epochs. Dr.\r\nNewberry, in his Report on the Cretaceous and Tertiary floras of the\r\nYellowstone and Missouri Rivers, states, that although the Miocene flora of\r\nCentral North {156}America corresponds generally with that of the European\r\nMiocene, yet many of the tropical, and especially the Australian types,\r\nsuch as _Hakea_ and _Dryandra_, are absent. Owing to the recent discovery\r\nof a rich Cretaceous flora in North America, probably of the same age as\r\nthat of Aix-la-Chapelle in Europe, we are able to continue the comparison;\r\nand it appears, that at this early period the difference was still more\r\nmarked. The predominant feature of the European Cretaceous flora seems to\r\nhave been the abundance of Proteaceæ, of which seven genera now living in\r\nAustralia or the Cape of Good Hope have been recognised, besides others\r\nwhich are extinct. There are also several species of _Pandanus_, or\r\nscrew-pine, now confined to the tropics of the Eastern Hemisphere, and\r\nalong with these, oaks, pines, and other more temperate forms. The North\r\nAmerican Cretaceous flora, although far richer than that of Europe,\r\ncontains no Proteaceæ or _Pandani_, but immense numbers of forest trees of\r\nliving and extinct genera. Among the former we have oaks, beeches, willows,\r\nplanes, alders, dog-wood, and cypress; together with such American forms as\r\nmagnolias, sassafras, and liriodendrons. There are also a few not now found\r\nin America, as _Araucaria_ and _Cinnamomum_, the latter still living in\r\nJapan. This remarkable flora has been found over a wide extent of\r\ncountry--New Jersey, Alabama, Kansas, and near the sources of the Missouri\r\nin the latitude of Quebec--so that we can hardly impute its peculiarly\r\ntemperate character to the great elevation of so large an area. The\r\nintervening Eocene flora approximates closely, in North America, to that of\r\nthe Miocene period; while in Europe it seems to have been fully as tropical\r\nin character as that of the preceding Cretaceous period; fruits of _Nipa_,\r\n_Pandanus_, _Anona_, _Acacia_, and many Proteaceæ, occurring in the London\r\nclay at the mouth of the Thames.\r\n\r\nThese facts appear, at first sight, to be inconsistent, unless we suppose\r\nthe climates of Europe and North America to have been widely different in\r\nthese early times; but they may perhaps be harmonised, on the supposition\r\nof a more uniform and a somewhat milder climate then prevailing over the\r\nwhole Northern Hemisphere; the contrast in the vegetation of these\r\ncountries {157}being due to a radical difference of type, and therefore not\r\nindicative of climate. The early European flora seems to have been a\r\nportion of that which now exists only in the tropical and sub-tropical\r\nlands of the Eastern Hemisphere; and, as much of this flora still survives\r\nin Australia, Tasmania, Japan, and the Cape of Good Hope, it does not\r\nnecessarily imply more than a warm and equable temperate climate. The early\r\nNorth American flora, on the other hand, seems to have been essentially the\r\nsame in type as that which now exists there, and which, in the Miocene\r\nperiod, was well represented in Europe; and it is such as now flourishes\r\nbest in the warmer parts of the United States. But whatever conclusion we\r\nmay arrive at on the question of climate, there can be no doubt as to the\r\ndistinctness of the floras of the ancient Nearctic and Palæarctic regions;\r\nand the view derived from our study of their existing and extinct\r\nfaunas--that these two regions have, in past times, been more clearly\r\nseparated than they are now--receives strong support from the unexpected\r\nevidence now obtained as to the character and mutations of their vegetable\r\nforms, during so vast an epoch as is comprised in the whole duration of the\r\nTertiary period.\r\n\r\nThe general phenomena of the distribution of living animals, combined with\r\nthe evidence of extinct forms, lead us to conclude that the Palæarctic\r\nregion of early Tertiary times was, for the most part, situated beyond the\r\ntropics, although it probably had a greater southward extension than at the\r\npresent time. It certainly included much of North Africa, and perhaps\r\nreached far into what is now the Sahara; while a southward extension of its\r\ncentral mass may have included the Abyssinian highlands, where some truly\r\nPalæarctic forms are still found. This is rendered probable by the fossils\r\nof Perim Island a little further east, which show that the characteristic\r\nMiocene fauna of South Europe and North India prevailed so far within the\r\ntropics. There existed, however, at the extreme eastern and western limits\r\nof the region, two extensive equatorial land-areas, our Indo-Malayan and\r\nWest African sub-regions--both of which must have been united for more or\r\nless considerable periods with the northern continent. They would then have\r\nreceived {158}from it such of the higher vertebrates as were best adapted\r\nfor the peculiar climatal and organic conditions which everywhere prevail\r\nnear the equator; and these would be preserved, under variously modified\r\nforms, when they had ceased to exist in the less favourable and constantly\r\ndeteriorating climate of the north. At later epochs, both these equatorial\r\nlands became united to some part of the great South African continent (then\r\nincluding Madagascar), and we thus have explained many of the similarities\r\npresented by the faunas of these distant, and generally very different\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nDuring the Miocene period, when a subtropical climate prevailed over much\r\nof Europe and Central Asia, there would be no such marked contrast as now\r\nprevails between temperate and tropical zones; and at this time much of our\r\nOriental region, perhaps, formed a hardly separable portion of the great\r\nPalæarctic land. But when, from unknown causes, the climate of Europe\r\nbecame less genial, and when the elevation of the Himalayan chain and the\r\nMongolian plateau caused an abrupt difference of climate on the northern\r\nand southern sides of that great mountain barrier, a tropical and a\r\ntemperate region were necessarily formed; and many of the animals which\r\nonce roamed over the greater part of the older and more extensive region,\r\nnow became restricted to its southern or northern divisions respectively.\r\nThen came the great change we have already described (vol. i. p. 288),\r\nopening the newly-formed plains of Central Africa to the incursions of the\r\nhigher forms of Europe; and following on this, a still further\r\ndeterioration of climate, resulting in that marked contrast between\r\ntemperate and tropical faunas, which is now one of the most prominent\r\nfeatures in the distribution of animal as well as of vegetable forms.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to go into any further details here, as we have\r\nalready, in our discussion of the origin of the fauna of the several\r\nregions, pointed out what changes most probably occurred in each case.\r\nThese details are, however, to a great extent speculative; and they must\r\nremain so till we obtain as much knowledge of the extinct faunas and past\r\ngeological history of the southern lands, as we have of those of Europe and\r\nNorth {159}America. But the broad conclusions at which we have now arrived\r\nseem to rest on a sufficiently extensive basis of facts; and they lead us\r\nto a clearer conception of the mutual relations and comparative importance\r\nof the several regions than could be obtained at an earlier stage of our\r\ninquiries.\r\n\r\nIf our views of the origin of the several regions are correct, it is clear\r\nthat no mere binary division--into north and south, or into east and\r\nwest--can be altogether satisfactory, since at the dawn of the Tertiary\r\nperiod we still find our six regions, or what may be termed the rudiments\r\nof them, already established. The north and south division truly represents\r\nthe fact, that the great northern continents are the seat and birth-place\r\nof all the higher forms of life, while the southern continents have derived\r\nthe greater part, if not the whole, of their vertebrate fauna from the\r\nnorth; but it implies the erroneous conclusion, that the chief southern\r\nlands--Australia and South America--are more closely related to each other\r\nthan to the northern continent. The fact, however, is that the fauna of\r\neach has been derived, independently, and perhaps at very different times,\r\nfrom the north, with which they therefore have a true genetic relation;\r\nwhile any intercommunion between themselves has been comparatively recent\r\nand superficial, and has in no way modified the great features of animal\r\nlife in each. The east and west division, represents--according to our\r\nviews--a more fundamental diversity; since we find the northern continent\r\nitself so divided in the earliest Eocene, and even in Cretaceous times;\r\nwhile we have the strongest proof that South America was peopled from the\r\nNearctic, and Australia and Africa from the Palæarctic region: hence, the\r\nEastern and Western Hemispheres are the two great branches of the tree of\r\nlife of our globe. But this division, taken by itself, would obscure the\r\nfacts--firstly, of the close relation and parallelism of the Nearctic and\r\nPalæarctic regions, not only now but as far back as we can clearly trace\r\nthem in the past; and, secondly, of the existing radical diversity of the\r\nAustralian region from the rest of the Eastern Hemisphere.\r\n\r\nOwing to the much greater extent of the old Palæarctic region (including\r\nour Oriental), and the greater diversity of {160}Mammalia it appears to\r\nhave produced, we can have little doubt that here was the earliest seat of\r\nthe development of the vertebrate type; and probably of the higher forms of\r\ninsects and land-molluscs. Whether the Nearctic region ever formed one mass\r\nwith it, or only received successive immigrations from it by northern\r\nland-connections both in an easterly and westerly direction, we cannot\r\ndecide; but the latter seems the most probable supposition. In any case, we\r\nmust concede the first rank to the Palæarctic and Oriental regions, as\r\nrepresenting the most important part of what seems always to have been the\r\nGreat Continent of the earth, and the source from which all the other\r\nregions were supplied with the higher forms of life. These once formed a\r\nsingle great region, which has been since divided into a temperate and a\r\ntropical portion, now sufficiently distinct; while the Nearctic region has,\r\nby deterioration of climate, suffered a considerable diminution of\r\nproductive area, and has in consequence lost a number of its more\r\nremarkable forms. The two temperate regions have thus come to resemble each\r\nother more than they once did, while the Oriental retains more of the\r\nzoological aspect of the great northern regions of Miocene times. The\r\nEthiopian, from having been once an insular region, where lower types of\r\nvertebrates alone prevailed, has been so overrun with higher types from the\r\nold Palæarctic and Oriental lands that it now rivals, or even surpasses,\r\nthe Oriental region in its representation of the ancient fauna of the great\r\nnorthern continent. Both of our tropical regions of the Eastern Hemisphere\r\npossess faunas which are, to some extent, composite, being made up in\r\ndifferent proportions of the productions of the northern and southern\r\ncontinents,--the former prevailing largely in the Oriental, while the\r\nlatter constitutes an important feature in the Ethiopian fauna. The\r\nNeotropical region has probably undergone great fluctuations in early\r\ntimes; but it was, undoubtedly, for long periods completely isolated, and\r\nthen developed the Edentate type of Mammals and the Formicaroid type of\r\nPasserine birds into a variety of forms, comparable with the diversified\r\nMarsupials of Australia, and typical Passeres of the Eastern Hemisphere.\r\n{161}It has, however, received successive infusions of higher types from\r\nthe north, which now mingle in various degrees with its lower forms. At an\r\nearly period it must have received a low form of Primates, which has been\r\ndeveloped into the two peculiar families of American monkeys; while its\r\nllamas, tapirs, deer, and peccaries, came in at a later date, and its\r\nopossums and extinct horses probably among the latest. The Australian\r\nregion alone, after having been united with the great northern continent at\r\na very early date (probably during the Secondary period) has ever since\r\nremained more or less completely isolated; and thus exhibits the\r\ndevelopment of a primeval type of mammal, almost wholly uninfluenced by any\r\nincursions of a later and higher type. In this respect it is unique among\r\nall the great regions of the earth.\r\n\r\nWe see, then, that each of our six regions has had a history of its own,\r\nthe main outlines of which we have been able to trace with tolerable\r\ncertainty. Each of them is now characterised--as it seems to have been in\r\nall past time of which we have any tolerably full record--by well-marked\r\nzoological features; while all are connected and related in the complex\r\nmodes we have endeavoured to unravel. To combine any two or more of these\r\nregions, on account of existing similarities which are, for the most part,\r\nof recent origin, would obscure some of the most important and interesting\r\nfeatures of their past history and present condition. And it seems no less\r\nimpracticable to combine the whole into groups of higher rank; since it has\r\nbeen shown that there are two opposing modes of doing this, and that each\r\nof them represents but one aspect of a problem, which can only be solved by\r\ngiving equal attention to all its aspects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor reasons which have been already stated, and which are sufficiently\r\nobvious, we have relied almost exclusively on the distribution of living\r\nand extinct mammalia, in arriving at these conclusions. But we believe they\r\nwill apply equally to elucidate the phenomena presented by the distribution\r\nof all terrestrial organisms, when combined with a careful consideration of\r\nthe {162}various means of dispersal of the different groups, and the\r\ncomparative longevity of their species and genera. Even insects, which are\r\nperhaps of all animals the farthest removed from mammalia in this respect,\r\nagree, in the great outlines of their distribution, with the vertebrate\r\norders. The Regions are admittedly the same, or nearly the same for both;\r\nand the discrepancies that occur are of a nature which can be explained by\r\ntwo undoubted facts--the greater antiquity, and the greater facilities for\r\ndispersal, of insects.\r\n\r\nBut this principle, if sound, must be carried farther, and be applied to\r\nplants also. There are not wanting indications that this may be\r\nsuccessfully done; and it seems not improbable, that the reason why\r\nbotanists have hitherto failed to determine, with any unanimity, which are\r\nthe most natural phytological regions, and to work out any connected theory\r\nof the migrations of plants, is, because they have not been furnished with\r\nthe clue to the past changes of the great land masses, which could only be\r\narrived at by such an examination of the past and present distribution of\r\nthe higher animals as has been here attempted. The difficulties in the way\r\nof the study of the distribution of plants, from this point of view, will\r\nbe undoubtedly very great; owing to the unusual facilities for distribution\r\nmany of them possess, and the absence of any group which might take the\r\nplace of the mammalia among animals, and serve as a guide and standard for\r\nthe rest. We cannot expect the regions to be so well defined in the case of\r\nplants as in that of animals; and there are sure to be many anomalies and\r\ndiscrepancies, which will require long study to unravel. The Six Great\r\nRegions here adopted, are however, as a whole, very well characterised by\r\ntheir vegetable forms. The floras of tropical America, of Australia, of\r\nSouth Africa, and of Indo-Malaya, stand out with as much individuality as\r\ndo the faunas; while the plants of the Palæarctic and Nearctic regions,\r\nexhibit resemblances and diversities, of a character not unlike those found\r\namong the animals.\r\n\r\nThis is not a mere question of applying to the vegetable kingdom a series\r\nof arbitrary divisions of the earth which have been {163}found useful to\r\nzoologists; for it really involves a fundamental problem in the theory of\r\nevolution. The question we have to answer, is, firstly--whether the\r\ndistribution of plants is, like that of animals, mainly and primarily\r\ndependent on the past revolutions of the earth's surface; or, whether\r\nother, and altogether distinct causes, have had a preponderating influence\r\nin determining the range and limits of vegetable forms; and,\r\nsecondly--whether those revolutions have been, in their general outlines,\r\ncorrectly interpreted by means of a study of the distribution and\r\naffinities of the higher animals. The first question is one for botanists\r\nalone to answer; but, on the second point, the author ventures to hope for\r\nan affirmative reply, from such of his readers as will weigh carefully the\r\nfacts and arguments he has adduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe remaining part of this volume, will consist, of a systematic review of\r\nthe distribution of each family of animals, and an application of the\r\nprinciples already established to elucidate the chief phenomena they\r\npresent. The present chapter must, therefore, be considered as the\r\nconclusion of the argumentative and theoretical part of the present work;\r\nbut it must be read in connection with the various discussions in Parts II.\r\nand III., in which the conclusions to be drawn from the several groups of\r\nfacts have been successively given;--and especially in connection with the\r\ngeneral observations at the end of each of the six chapters on the\r\nZoological Regions.\r\n\r\nThe hypothetical view, as to the more recent of the great Geographical\r\nchanges of the Earth's surface, here set forth, is not the result of any\r\npreconceived theory, but has grown out of a careful study of the facts\r\naccumulated, and has led to a considerable modification of the author's\r\nprevious views. It may be described, as an application of the general\r\ntheory of Evolution, to solve the problem of the distribution of animals;\r\nbut it also furnishes some independent support to that theory, both by\r\nshowing what a great variety of curious facts are explained by its means,\r\nand by answering some of the objections, {164}which have been founded on\r\nsupposed difficulties in the distribution of animals in space and time.\r\n\r\nIt also illustrates and supports the geological doctrine, of the general\r\npermanence of our great continents and oceans, by showing how many facts in\r\nthe distribution of animals can only be explained and understood on such a\r\nsupposition; and it exhibits, in a striking manner, the enormous influence\r\nof the Glacial epoch, in determining the existing zoological features of\r\nthe various continents.\r\n\r\nAnd, lastly, it furnishes a more consistent and intelligible idea than has\r\nyet been reached by any other mode of investigation, of all the more\r\nimportant changes of the earth's surface that have probably occurred during\r\nthe entire Tertiary period; and of the influence of these changes, in\r\nbringing about the general features, as well as many of the more\r\ninteresting details and puzzling anomalies, of the Geographical\r\nDistribution of Animals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART IV.\r\n\r\n_GEOGRAPHICAL ZOOLOGY:_\r\n\r\n_A SYSTEMATIC SKETCH OF THE CHIEF FAMILIES OF LAND ANIMALS IN THEIR\r\nGEOGRAPHICAL RELATIONS._\r\n\r\n\r\n{167}INTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the preceding part of our work, we have discussed the geographical\r\ndistribution of animals from the point of view of the geographer; taking\r\nthe different regions of the earth in succession, and giving as full an\r\naccount as our space would permit of their chief forms of animal life. Now,\r\nwe proceed from the standpoint of the systematic zoologist; taking in\r\nsuccession each of the families with which we deal, and giving an account\r\nof the distribution, both of the entire family and, as far as practicable,\r\nof each of the genera of which it is composed. As in the former part, our\r\nmode of treatment led us to speculate on the past changes of the earth's\r\nsurface; so here we shall endeavour to elucidate the past migrations of\r\nanimals, and thus, to some extent, account for their actual distribution.\r\n\r\nThe tabular headings, showing the range of the family in each region, will\r\nenable the reader to determine at a glance the general distribution of the\r\ngroup, as soon as he has familiarised himself, by a study of our general\r\nand regional maps, with the limits of the regions and sub-regions, and the\r\nfigures (1 to 4) by which the latter are indicated. Much pains have been\r\ntaken, to give the number of the known genera and species in each family,\r\ncorrectly; but these numbers must, in most cases, only be looked upon as\r\napproximations; because, owing to constant accessions of fresh material on\r\nthe one hand, and the discovery that many supposed species are only\r\nvarieties, on the other, such statistics are in a continual state of\r\nfluctuation. In the number of genera there is the greatest uncertainty; as\r\nwill be seen by the two sets of numbers sometimes given, which denote the\r\ngenera according to different modern authorities.\r\n\r\n{168}There is also a considerable difference in the dependence to be placed\r\non the details given in the different classes of animals. In Mammalia and\r\nBirds some degree of accuracy has, it is hoped, been attained; the\r\nclassification of these groups being much advanced, and the materials for\r\ntheir study ample. In Reptiles this is not the case, as there is no\r\nrecently published work dealing with the whole subject, or with either of\r\nthe larger orders. An immense number of new species and new genera of\r\nsnakes and lizards, have been described in the last twenty years; and Dr.\r\nGünther--our greatest authority on reptiles in this country--has kindly\r\nassisted me in incorporating such of these as are most trustworthy, in a\r\ngeneral system; but until entire Orders have been described or catalogued\r\non a uniform plan, nothing more than a general approximation to the truth\r\ncan be arrived at. Still, so many of the groups are well defined, and have\r\na clearly limited distribution, that some interesting and valuable\r\ncomparisons may be made.\r\n\r\nFor Fishes, the valuable \"Catalogue\" of Dr. Günther was available, and it\r\nhas rarely been attempted to go beyond it. A large number of new species\r\nhave since been described, in all parts of the world; but it is impossible\r\nto say how many of these are really new, or what genera they actually\r\nbelong to. The part devoted to this Class is, therefore, practically a\r\nsummary of Dr. Günther's Catalogue; and it is believed that the discoveries\r\nsince made will not materially invalidate the conclusions to be drawn from\r\nsuch a large number of species, which have been critically examined and\r\nclassified on a uniform system by one of our most able naturalists. When a\r\nsupplement to this catalogue is issued, it will be easier to make the\r\nnecessary alterations in distribution, than if a mass of untrustworthy\r\nmaterials had been mixed up with it.\r\n\r\nFor Insects, excellent materials are furnished, in the Catalogue of Mr.\r\nKirby for Butterflies and in that of Drs. Gemminger and Harold for\r\nColeoptera. I have also made use of some recently published memoirs on the\r\nInsects of Japan and St. Helena, and a few other recent works; and have, I\r\nbelieve, elaborated a more extensive series of facts to illustrate the\r\ndistribution of insects, {169}than has been made use of by any previous\r\nwriter. Several discussions on the bearing of the facts of insect\r\ndistribution, will also be found under the several Regions, in the\r\npreceding part of this work.\r\n\r\nTerrestrial Mollusca form a group, as to the treatment of which I have most\r\nmisgivings; owing to my almost entire ignorance of Malacology, and the\r\ngreat changes recently made in the classification of shells. There is also\r\nmuch uncertainty as to genera and sub-genera, which is very puzzling to one\r\nwho merely wishes to get at general results. Finding it impossible to\r\nincorporate the new matter with the old, or to harmonise the different\r\nclassifications of modern conchologists, I thought it better to confine\r\nmyself to the standard works of Martens and Pfeiffer, with such additions\r\nof new species as I could make without fear of going far wrong. In some\r\ncases I have made use of recent monographs--especially on the shells of\r\nEurope, North America, the West Indian Islands, and the Sandwich Islands;\r\nand have, I venture to hope, not fallen into much error in the general\r\nconclusions at which I have arrived.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{170}CHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nTHE DISTRIBUTION OF THE FAMILIES AND GENERA OF MAMMALIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Order I.--PRIMATES._\r\n\r\nFAMILY 1.--SIMIIDÆ.

They inhabit the\r\ntropics of the Old World, and are most abundant near the equator; but they\r\nare limited to certain districts, being quite unknown in eastern and\r\nsouthern Africa, and the whole peninsula of Hindostan.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Troglodytes_ (or _Mimetes_, as it is sometimes named)\r\ncomprehends the chimpanzee and gorilla. It is confined to the West African\r\nsub-region, being found on the coast about 12° North and South of the\r\nequator, from the Gambia to Benguela, and as far inland as the great\r\nequatorial forests extend. There are perhaps other species of chimpanzee;\r\nsince Livingstone met with what he supposed to be a new species in the\r\nforest region west of Lake Tanganyika, while Dr. Schweinfurth found one in\r\nthe country beyond the western watershed of the Nile. The gorilla is\r\nconfined within narrower limits on and near the equator.\r\n\r\n{171}We have to pass over more than 70° of longitude before we again meet\r\nwith Anthropoid Apes, in the northern part of Sumatra--where a specimen of\r\nthe orang-utan (_Simia satyrus_) now in the Calcutta Museum, was obtained\r\nby Dr. Abel, and described by him in the _Asiatic Researches_, vol.\r\nxv.--and in Borneo, from which latter island almost all the specimens in\r\nEuropean museums have been derived. There are supposed to be two species of\r\n_Simia_ in Borneo, a larger and a smaller; but their distinctness is not\r\nadmitted by all naturalists. Both appear to be confined to the swampy\r\nforests near the north, west, and south coasts.\r\n\r\nThe Gibbons, or long-armed apes, forming the genus _Hylobates_, (7 species)\r\nare found in all the large islands of the Indo-Malayan sub-region, except\r\nthe Philippines; and also in Sylhet and Assam south of the Brahmaputra\r\nriver, eastward to Cambodja and South China to the west of Canton, and in\r\nthe island of Hainan.\r\n\r\nThe Siamang (_Siamanga syndactyla_) presents some anatomical peculiarities,\r\nand has the second and third toes united to the last joint, but in general\r\nform and structure it does not differ from _Hylobates_. It is the largest\r\nof the long-armed apes, and inhabits Sumatra and the Malay peninsula.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY 2.--SEMNOPITHECIDÆ.

They have nearly the\r\nsame distribution as the last family, but are more widely dispersed in both\r\nAfrica and Asia, one species just entering the Palæarctic region.\r\n\r\nThe Eastern genus _Presbytes_ or _Semnopithecus_ (29 species), is spread\r\nover almost the whole of the Oriental region wherever the forests are\r\nextensive. They extend along the Himalayas to beyond Simla, where a species\r\nhas been observed at an altitude of 11,000 {172}feet, playing among\r\nfir-trees laden with snow wreaths. On the west side of India they are not\r\nfound to the north of 14° N. latitude. On the east they extend into Arakan,\r\nand to Borneo and Java, but not apparently into Siam or Cambodja. Along the\r\neastern extension of the Himalayas they again occur in East Thibet; a\r\nremarkable species with a large upturned nose (_S. roxellana_) having been\r\ndiscovered by Père David at Moupin (about Lat. 32° N.) in the highest\r\nforests, where the winters are severe and last for several months, and\r\nwhere the vegetation, and the other forms of animal life, are wholly those\r\nof the Palæarctic region. It is very curious that this species should\r\nsomewhat resemble the young state of the proboscis monkey (_S. nasalis_),\r\nwhich inhabits one of the most uniform, damp, and hot climates on the\r\nglobe--the river-swamps of Borneo.\r\n\r\n_Colobus_, the African genus (11 species), is very closely allied to the\r\npreceding, differing chiefly in the thumb being absent or rudimentary. They\r\nare confined to the tropical regions--Abyssinia on the east, and from the\r\nGambia to Angola and the island of Fernando Po, on the west.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY 3.--CYNOPITHECIDÆ.

Some of these have very long tails, some none; some are dog-faced,\r\nothers tolerably round-faced; but there are so many transitions from one to\r\nthe other, and such a general agreement in structure, that they are now\r\nconsidered to form a very natural family. Their range is more extensive\r\nthan any other family of Quadrumana, since they not only occur in every\r\npart of the Ethiopian and Oriental regions, but enter the Palæarctic region\r\nin the east and west, and the Australian region as far as the islands of\r\nTimor and Batchian. The African genera {173}are _Myiopithecus_,\r\n_Cercopithecus_, _Cercocebus_, _Theropithecus_, and _Cynocephalus_; the\r\nOriental genera, _Macacus_, and _Cynopithecus_.\r\n\r\n_Myiopithecus_ (1 species), consisting of the talapoin monkey of West\r\nAfrica, differs from the other African monkeys in the structure of the last\r\nmolar tooth; in the large ears, short face, and wide internasal septum; in\r\nthis respect, as well as in its grace and gentleness, resembling some of\r\nthe American monkeys.\r\n\r\n_Cercopithecus_ (24 species), contains all the more graceful and prettily\r\ncoloured monkeys of tropical Africa, and comprises the guenons, the\r\nwhite-nosed, and the green monkeys. They range from the Gambia to the\r\nCongo, and from Abyssinia to the Zambesi.\r\n\r\n_Cercocebus_ (5 species), the mangabeys, of West Africa, are very closely\r\nallied to the eastern genus _Macacus_.\r\n\r\n_Theropithecus_ (2 species), including the gelada of Abyssinia and an\r\nallied species, resemble in form the baboons, but have the nostrils placed\r\nas in the last genus.\r\n\r\n_Cynocephalus_ (10 species), the baboons, are found in all parts of Africa.\r\nThey consist of animals which vary much in appearance, but which agree in\r\nhaving an elongated dog-like muzzle with terminal nostrils, and being of\r\nterrestrial habits. Some of the baboons are of very large size, the\r\nmandrill (_C. maimon_) being only inferior to the orang and gorilla.\r\n\r\n_Macacus_ (25 species), is the commonest form of eastern monkey, and is\r\nfound in every part of the Oriental region, as well as in North Africa,\r\nGibraltar, Thibet, North China, and Japan; and one of the commonest\r\nspecies, _M. cynomolgus_, has extended its range from Java eastward to the\r\nextremity of Timor. The tail varies greatly in length, and in the Gibraltar\r\nmonkey (_M. innus_) is quite absent. A remarkable species clothed with very\r\nthick fur, has lately been discovered in the snowy mountains of eastern\r\nThibet.\r\n\r\n_Cynopithecus_ (? 2 sp.).--This genus consists of a black baboon-like Ape,\r\ninhabiting Celebes, Batchian, and the Philippine Islands; but perhaps\r\nintroduced by man into the latter islands and into Batchian. It is doubtful\r\nif there is more than one species. The tail of this animal is a fleshy\r\ntubercle, the nostrils as in _Macacus_, but the muzzle is very prominent;\r\nand the {174}development of the maxillary bones into strong lateral ridges\r\ncorresponds to the structure of the most typical baboons. This species\r\nextends further east than any other quadrumanous animal.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY 4.--CEBIDÆ.

Some have\r\nprehensile tails, especially adapting them for an arboreal life. They are\r\ndivided into four sub-families,--Cebinæ, Mycetinæ, Pitheciinæ, and\r\nNyctipithecinæ. The Cebidæ are strictly confined to the forest regions of\r\ntropical America, from the southern part of Mexico to about the parallel of\r\n30° South Latitude. The distribution of the genera is as follows:--\r\n\r\n_Sub-family_, Cebinæ.--_Cebus_ (18 sp.), is the largest genus of American\r\nmonkeys, and ranges from Costa Rica to Paraguay. They are commonly called\r\nsapajous. _Lagothrix_ (5 sp.), the woolly monkeys, are rather larger and\r\nless active than the preceding; they are confined to the forests of the\r\nUpper Amazon Valley, and along the slopes of the Andes to Venezuela and\r\nBolivia. _Ateles_ (14 sp.), the spider monkeys, have very long limbs and\r\ntail. They range over the whole area of the family, and occur on the west\r\nside of the Equatorial Andes and on the Pacific coast of Guatemala.\r\n_Eriodes_ (3 sp.), are somewhat intermediate between the last two genera,\r\nand are confined to the eastern parts of Brazil south of the equator. The\r\nthree last mentioned genera have very powerful prehensile tails, the end\r\nbeing bare beneath; whereas the species of _Cebus_ have the tail\r\n{175}completely covered with hair, although prehensile, and therefore not\r\nso perfect a grasping organ.\r\n\r\n_Sub-family_, Mycetinæ, consists of but a single genus, _Mycetes_ (10 sp.),\r\nthe howling monkeys, characterized by having a hollow bony vessel in the\r\nthroat formed by an enlargement of the hyoid bone, which enables them to\r\nproduce a wonderful howling noise. They are large, heavy animals, with a\r\npowerful and perfect prehensile tail. They range from East Guatemala to\r\nParaguay. (Plate XIV., vol. ii., p. 24.)\r\n\r\n_Sub-family_, Pitheciinæ, the sakis, have a non-prehensile bushy tail.\r\n_Pithecia_ (7 sp.), has the tail of moderate length; while _Brachiurus_ (5\r\nsp.) has it very short. Both appear to be restricted to the great\r\nequatorial forests of South America.\r\n\r\n_Sub-family_, Nyctipithecinæ, are small and elegant monkeys, with long,\r\nhairy, non-prehensile tails. _Nyctipithecus_ (5 sp.), the night-monkeys or\r\ndouroucoulis, have large eyes, nocturnal habits, and are somewhat lemurine\r\nin their appearance. They range from Nicaragua to the Amazon and eastern\r\nPeru. _Saimiris_ or _Chrysothrix_ (3 sp.), the squirrel-monkeys, are\r\nbeautiful and active little creatures, found in most of the tropical\r\nforests from Costa Rica to Brazil and Bolivia. _Callithrix_ (11 sp.), are\r\nsomewhat intermediate between the last two genera, and are found all over\r\nSouth America from Panama to the southern limits of the great forests.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY 5.--HAPALIDÆ.

The thumb is not at all opposable, and all the fingers\r\nare armed with sharp claws. The hallux, or thumb-like great toe, is very\r\nsmall; the tail is long and not prehensile. The two genera _Hapale_ (9\r\nsp.), and _Midas_ (24 sp.), are of doubtful value, though some naturalists\r\nhave still further sub-divided them.

It was for a long time very\r\nimperfectly known, and was supposed to belong to the Rodentia; but it has\r\nnow been ascertained to be an exceedingly specialized form of the Lemuroid\r\ntype, and must be considered to be one of the most extraordinary of the\r\nmammalia now inhabiting the globe. (Plate VI., vol. i., p. 278.)\r\n\r\n\r\n{178}_Fossil Quadrumana._\r\n\r\nNot much progress has yet been made in tracing back the various forms of\r\nApes and Monkeys to their earliest appearance on the globe; but there have\r\nbeen some interesting recent discoveries, which lead us to hope that the\r\nfield is not yet exhausted. The following is a summary of what is known as\r\nto the early forms of each family:--\r\n\r\n_Simiidæ._--Two or three species of this family have been found in the\r\nUpper Miocene deposits of France and Switzerland. _Pliopithecus_, of which\r\na species has been found at each locality, was allied to the gibbons\r\n(_Hylobates_), and perhaps to _Semnopithecus_. A more remarkable form,\r\nnamed _Dryopithecus_, as large as a man, and having peculiarities of\r\nstructure which are thought by Gervais and Lartet to indicate a nearer\r\napproach to the human form than any existing Ape, has been found in strata\r\nof the same age in France.\r\n\r\n_Semnopithecidæ._--Species of _Semnopithecus_ have been found in the Upper\r\nMiocene of Greece, and others in the Siwalik Hills of N. W. India, also of\r\nUpper Miocene age. An allied form also occurs in the Miocene of Wurtemburg.\r\n_Mesopithecus_ from Greece is somewhat intermediate between _Semnopithecus_\r\nand _Macacus_.\r\n\r\nRemains supposed to be of _Semnopithecus_, have also occurred in the\r\nPliocene of Montpellier.\r\n\r\n_Cynopithecidæ._--_Macacus_ has occurred in Pliocene deposits at Grays,\r\nEssex; and also in the South of France along with _Cercopithecus_.\r\n\r\n_Cebidæ._--In the caves of Brazil remains of the genera _Cebus_, _Mycetes_,\r\n_Callithrix_, and _Hapale_, have been found; as well as an extinct form of\r\nlarger size--_Protopithecus_.\r\n\r\n_Lemuroidea._--A true lemur has recently been discovered in the Eocene of\r\nFrance; and it is supposed to be most nearly allied to the peculiar West\r\nAfrican genera, _Perodicticus_ and _Arctocebus_.\r\n\r\n_Cænopithecus_, from the Swiss Jura, is supposed to have affinities both\r\nfor the Lemuridæ and the American Cebidæ.\r\n\r\nIn the lower Eocene of North America remains have been {179}discovered,\r\nwhich are believed to belong to this sub-order: but they form two distinct\r\nfamilies,--Lemuravidæ and Limnotheridæ. Other remains from the Miocene are\r\nbelieved to be intermediate between these and the Cebidæ,--a most\r\ninteresting and suggestive affinity, if well founded. For the genera of\r\nthese American Lemuroidea, see vol. i., p. 133.\r\n\r\n\r\n_General Remarks on the Distribution of Primates._\r\n\r\nThe most striking fact presented by this order, from our present point of\r\nview, is the strict limitation of well-marked families to definite areas.\r\nThe Cebidæ and Hapalidæ would alone serve to mark out tropical America as\r\nthe nucleus of one of the great zoological divisions of the earth. In the\r\nEastern Hemisphere, the corresponding fact is the entire absence of the\r\norder from the Australian region, with the exception of one or two outlying\r\nforms, which have evidently transgressed the normal limits of their group.\r\nThe separation of the Ethiopian and Oriental regions is, in this order,\r\nmainly indicated by the distribution of the genera, no one of which is\r\ncommon to the two regions. The two highest families, the Simiidæ and the\r\nSemnopithecidæ, are pretty equally distributed about two equatorial foci,\r\none situated in West Africa, the other in the Malay archipelago,--in Borneo\r\nor the Peninsula of Malacca;--while the third family, Cynopithecidæ, ranges\r\nover the whole of both regions, and somewhat overpasses their limits. The\r\nLemuroid group, on the other hand, offers us one of the most singular\r\nphenomena in geographical distribution. It consists of three families, the\r\nspecies of which are grouped into six sub-families and 13 genera. One of\r\nthese families and two of the sub-families, comprising 7 genera, and no\r\nless than 30 out of the total of 50 species, are confined to the one island\r\nof Madagascar. Of the remainder, 3 genera, comprising 15 species, are\r\nspread over tropical Africa; while three other genera with 5 species,\r\ninhabit certain restricted portions of India and the Malay islands. These\r\ncurious facts point unmistakably to the former existence of a large tract\r\nof land in what is now the Indian Ocean, connecting Madagascar on the one\r\nhand with Ceylon, and with the Malay countries on the {180}other. About\r\nthis same time (but perhaps not contemporaneously) Madagascar must have\r\nbeen connected with some portion of Southern Africa, and the whole of the\r\ncountry would possess no other Primates but Lemuroidea. After the\r\nMadagascar territory (very much larger than the existing island) had been\r\nseparated, a connection appears to have been long maintained (probably by a\r\nnortherly route) between the more equatorial portions of Asia and Africa;\r\ntill those higher forms had become developed, which were afterwards\r\ndifferentiated into _Simia_, _Presbytes_, and _Cynopithecus_, on the one\r\nhand, and into _Troglodytes_, _Colobus_, and _Cynocephalus_, on the other.\r\nIn accordance with the principle of competition so well expounded by Mr.\r\nDarwin, we can understand how, in the vast Asiatic and African area north\r\nof the Equator, with a great variety of physical conditions and the\r\ninfluence of a host of competing forms of life, higher types were developed\r\nthan in the less extensive and long-isolated countries south of the\r\nEquator. In Madagascar, where these less complex conditions prevailed in a\r\nconsiderable land-area, the lowly organized Lemuroids have diverged into\r\nmany specialized forms of their own peculiar type; while on the continents\r\nthey have, to a great extent, become exterminated, or have maintained their\r\nexistence in a few cases, in islands or in mountain ranges. In Africa the\r\nnocturnal and arboreal _Galagos_ are adapted to a special mode of life, in\r\nwhich they probably have few competitors.\r\n\r\nHow and when the ancestors of the Cebidæ and Hapalidæ entered the South\r\nAmerican continent, it is less easy to conceive. The only rays of light we\r\nyet have on the subject are, the supposed affinities of the fossil\r\n_Cænopithecus_ of the Swiss, and the Lemuravidæ of the North American\r\nEocene, with both Cebidæ and Lemuroids, and the fact that in Miocene or\r\nEocene times a mild climate prevailed up to the Arctic circle. The\r\ndiscovery of an undoubted Lemuroid in the Eocene of Europe, indicates that\r\nthe great Northern Continent was probably the birthplace of this low type\r\nof mammal, and the source whence Africa and Southern Asia were peopled with\r\nthem, as it was, at a later period, with the higher forms of monkeys and\r\napes.\r\n\r\n\r\n{181}_Order II.--CHIROPTERA._\r\n\r\nFAMILY 9.--PTEROPIDÆ.

They are most abundant and varied in the Oriental region, where\r\ntwelve genera are found; while only five inhabit the Australian and\r\nEthiopian regions respectively.

They range over almost the whole globe, being apparently only limited\r\nby the necessity of procuring insect food. In America they are found as far\r\nnorth as Hudson's Bay and the Columbia river; and in Europe they approach,\r\nif they do not pass the Arctic circle. Such remote islands as the Azores,\r\nBermudas, Fiji Islands, Sandwich Islands, and New Zealand, all possess\r\nspecies of this group of bats, some of which probably inhabit every island\r\nin warm or temperate parts of the globe.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Taphozous_, which, in our Tables of Distribution in vol. i. we\r\nhave included in this family, is placed by Mr. Dobson in his family\r\nEmballonuridæ, which is equivalent to our next family, Noctilionidæ.\r\n\r\n_Fossil Vespertilionidæ._--Several living European bats of this\r\nfamily--_Scotophilus murinus_, _Plecotus auritus_, _Vespertilio noctula_,\r\nand _V. pipestrellus_--have been found fossil in bone-caves in various\r\nparts of Europe.\r\n\r\nExtinct species of _Vespertilio_ have occurred in the Lower Miocene at\r\nMayence, in the Upper Miocene of the South of France, and in the Upper\r\nEocene of the Paris basin.\r\n\r\n\r\n{184}FAMILY 13.--NOCTILIONIDÆ.

Their head-quarters is the Neotropical region,\r\nwhere most of the genera occur, and where they range from Mexico to Buenos\r\nAyres and Chili, while in North America there is only one species in\r\nCalifornia. They are unknown in Australia; but one species occurs in New\r\nZealand, and another in Norfolk Island. Several species of _Dysopes_ (or\r\n_Molossus_) inhabit the Oriental region; one or two species being widely\r\ndistributed over the continent, while two others inhabit the Indo-Malayan\r\nIslands. A species of this same genus occurs in South Africa, and another\r\nin Madagascar and in the Island of Bourbon; while one inhabits Southern\r\nEurope and North Africa, and another is found at Amoy in China. It will be\r\nseen therefore, that these are really South American bats, which have a few\r\nallies widely scattered over the various regions of the globe. Their\r\naffinities are, according to Mr. Tomes, with the Phyllostomidæ, a purely\r\nSouth American family. The species which forms the connecting link is the\r\n_Mystacina tuberculata_, a New Zealand bat, which may, with almost equal\r\npropriety be placed in either family, and which affords an interesting\r\nillustration of the many points of resemblance between the Australian and\r\nNeotropical regions.\r\n\r\nDr. Peters has separated this family into three,--Mormopidæ, which is\r\nwholly Neotropical, and is especially abundant in the West Indian Islands;\r\nMolossidæ, chiefly consisting of the genus _Molossus_; and Noctilionidæ,\r\ncomprising the remainder of the family, and wholly Neotropical. Mr. Dobson,\r\nhowever, classes the Mormopes with the Phyllostomidæ, and reduces the\r\n{185}Molossi to the rank of a sub-family. In our first volume we have\r\nclassed _Rhinopoma_ with the Rhinolophidæ, and _Taphozous_ with the\r\nVespertilionidæ; but according to Mr. Dobson both these genera belong to\r\nthe present family.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Remarks on the Distribution of the Order Chiroptera._\r\n\r\nAlthough the bats, from their great powers of flight, are not amenable to\r\nthe limitations which determine the distribution of other terrestrial\r\nmammals, yet certain great facts of distribution come out in a very\r\nstriking manner. The speciality of the Neotropical region is well shown,\r\nnot only by its exclusive possession of one large family (Phyllostomidæ),\r\nbut almost equally so by the total absence of two others (Pteropidæ and\r\nRhinolophidæ). The Nearctic region is also unusually well marked, by the\r\ntotal absence of a family (Rhinolophidæ) which is tolerably well\r\nrepresented in the Palæarctic. The Pteropidæ well characterize the tropical\r\nregions of the Old World and Australia; while the Vespertilionidæ are more\r\ncharacteristic of the Palæarctic and Nearctic regions, which together\r\npossess about 60 species of this family.\r\n\r\nThe bats are a very difficult study, and it is quite uncertain how many\r\ndistinct species are really known. Schinz, in his _Synopsis Mammalium_\r\n(1844) describes 330, while the list given by Mr. Andrew Murray in his\r\n_Geographical Distribution of Mammalia_ (1866), contains 400 species. A\r\nsmall number of new species have been since described, but others have been\r\nsunk as synonyms, so that we can perhaps hardly obtain a nearer\r\napproximation to the truth than the last number. In Europe there are 35\r\nspecies, and only 17 in North America.\r\n\r\n_Fossil Chiroptera._--The fossil remains of bats that have yet been\r\ndiscovered, being chiefly allied to forms still existing in the same\r\ncountries, throw no light on the origin or affinities of this remarkable\r\nand isolated order of Mammalia; but as species very similar to those now\r\nliving were in existence so far back as Miocene or even Eocene times, we\r\nmay be sure the group is one of immense antiquity, and that there has been\r\nample time for the amount of variation and extinction required to bring\r\nabout {186}the limitation of types, and the peculiarities of distribution\r\nwe now find to exist.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Order III.--INSECTIVORA._\r\n\r\nFAMILY 14.--GALEOPITHECIDÆ.

Its food however, seems to be purely\r\nvegetable, and the very small, blind, and naked young, closely attached to\r\nthe wrinkled skin of the mother's breast, perhaps indicates some affinity\r\nwith the Marsupials.

If we consider that there are only 135 known species of the\r\norder, 65 of which belong to the one genus _Sorex_; while the remaining 26\r\ngenera contain only 70 species, which have to be classed in 8 distinct\r\nfamilies, and present such divergent and highly specialized forms as\r\n_Galeopithecus_, _Erinaceus_, _Solenodon_, and _Condylura_, it becomes\r\nevident that we have here the detached fragments of a much more\r\n{192}extensive group of animals, now almost extinct. Many of the forms\r\ncontinue to exist only in islands, removed from the severe competition of a\r\nvaried mammalian population, as in Madagascar and the Antilles; while\r\nothers appear to have escaped extermination either by their peculiar\r\nhabits--as the various forms of Moles; by special protection--as in the\r\nHedgehogs; or by a resemblance in form, coloration, and habits to dominant\r\ngroups in their own district--as the Tupaias of Malay which resemble\r\nsquirrels, and the Elephant-shrews of Africa which resemble the jerboas.\r\nThe numerous cases of isolated and discontinuous distribution among the\r\nInsectivora, offer no difficulty from this point of view; since they are\r\nthe necessary results of an extensive and widely-spread group of animals\r\nslowly becoming extinct, and continuing to exist only where special\r\nconditions have enabled them to maintain themselves in the struggle with\r\nmore highly organized forms.\r\n\r\nThe fossil Insectivora do not throw much light on the early history of the\r\norder, since even as far back as the Miocene period they consist almost\r\nwholly of forms which can be referred to existing families. In North\r\nAmerica they go back to the Eocene period, if certain doubtful remains have\r\nbeen rightly placed. The occurrence of fossil Centetidæ in Europe, supports\r\nthe view we have maintained in preceding chapters, that the existing\r\ndistribution of this family between Madagascar and the Antilles, proves no\r\ndirect connection between those islands, but only shows us that the family\r\nonce had an extensive range.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Order IV--CARNIVORA._\r\n\r\nFAMILY 23.--FELIDÆ.

They are so uniform in their organization that\r\nmany naturalists group them all under one genus, _Felis_; but it is now\r\nmore usual to class at least the lynxes as a separate genus, while the\r\nhunting leopard, or cheetah, forms another. Dr. J. E. Gray divides these\r\nagain, and makes 17 generic groups; but as this subdivision is not\r\ngenerally adopted, and does not bring out any special features of\r\ngeographical distribution, I shall not further notice it.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Felis_ (56 species) has the same general range as the whole\r\nfamily, except that it does not go so far north; the Amoor river in Eastern\r\nAsia, and 55° N. Lat. in America, marking its limits. _Lyncus_ (10 species)\r\nis a more northern group, ranging to the polar regions in Europe and Asia,\r\nand to Lat. 66° N. in America, but not going further south than Northern\r\nMexico and the European shores of the Mediterranean, except the caracal,\r\nwhich may be another genus, and which extends to Central India, Persia,\r\nNorth Africa and even the Cape of Good Hope. The lynxes are thus almost\r\nwholly peculiar to the Nearctic and Palæarctic regions. _Cynælurus_ (1\r\nspecies) the hunting leopard, ranges from Southern and Western India\r\nthrough Persia, Syria, Northern and Central Africa, to the Cape of Good\r\nHope.\r\n\r\n_Extinct Felidæ._--More than twenty extinct species of true Felidæ have\r\nbeen described, ranging in time from the epoch of prehistoric man back to\r\nthe Miocene or even the Eocene period. They occur in the south of England,\r\nin Central and South Europe, in North-West India, in Nebraska in North\r\nAmerica, and in the caves of Brazil. Most of them are referred to the genus\r\n_Felis_, and closely resemble the existing lions, tigers, and other large\r\ncats. Another group however forms the genus _Machairodus_, a highly\r\nspecialized form with serrated teeth. Five species have been described from\r\nEurope, Northern India, and both North and South America; and it is\r\nremarkable that they exhibit at least as wide a range, both in space and\r\ntime, as the more numerous species referred to _Felis_. One of them\r\nundoubtedly coexisted {194}with man in England, while another, as well as\r\nthe allied _Dinictis_, has been found in the Mauvaises Terres of Nebraska,\r\nassociated with _Anchitherium_ and other extinct and equally remarkable\r\nforms, which are certainly Miocene if not, as some geologists think,\r\nbelonging to the Eocene period. These facts clearly indicate that we have\r\nas yet made little approach to discovering the epoch when Felidæ\r\noriginated, since the oldest forms yet discovered are typical and highly\r\nspecialized representatives of a group which is itself the most specialized\r\nof the Carnivora. Another genus, _Pseudælurus_, is common to the Miocene\r\ndeposits of Europe and North America.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY 24.--CRYPTOPROCTIDÆ.

With the exception of two remarkable\r\nforms--the hyæna dog (_Lycaon picta_), and the great-eared fox (_Megalotis\r\nLalandei_), both from South Africa--all the species are usually placed in\r\nthe genus _Canis_, the distribution of which will be the same as that of\r\nthe family. Dr. J. E. Gray, in his arrangement of the family (Proc. Zool.\r\nSoc., 1868), subdivides it into fifteen genera, the names and general\r\ndistribution of which are as follows:--\r\n\r\n_Icticyon_ (1 species), Brazil; _Cuon_ (4 species), Siberia to Java;\r\n_Lupus_ (5 species), North America, Europe, India to Ceylon; _Dieba_ (1\r\nspecies), North and West Africa; _Simenia_ (1 species), Abyssinia;\r\n_Chrysocyon_ (2 species), North and South America; _Canis_ (4 species),\r\nIndia, Australia (indigenous?) _Lycalopex_ (2 species), South America;\r\n_Pseudalopex_ (5 species), South America and Falkland Islands; _Thous_ (2\r\nspecies), South America to Chili; _Vulpes_ (17 species), all the great\r\ncontinents, except South America and Australia; _Fennecus_ (4 species), all\r\nAfrica; _Leucocyon_ (1 species), Arctic regions; _Urocyon_ (2 species),\r\nNorth America; _Nyctereutes_ (1 species), Japan, Amoorland to Canton (Plate\r\nIII., vol. i. p. 226). These are all sub-genera according to Professor\r\nCarus, except _Icticyon_. The same author makes Lycaon a sub-genus, while\r\nDr. Gray makes it a sub-family!\r\n\r\n_Extinct Species._--The dog, wolf, and fox, are found fossil in\r\n{198}caverns in many parts of Europe, and several extinct species have been\r\nfound in Tertiary deposits in Europe, North India, and South America. Two\r\nspecies have been found so far back as the Eocene of France, but the\r\nfragments discovered are not sufficient to determine the characters with\r\nany certainty. In North America, several species of _Canis_ occur in the\r\nPliocene of Nebraska and La Plata. The genus _Galecynus_, of the Pliocene\r\nof Oeninghen, and _Palæocyon_, of the Brazilian caves, are supposed to\r\nbelong to the Canidæ. _Amphicyon_ abounded in the Miocene period, both in\r\nEurope and North America; and some of the species were as large as a tiger.\r\nOther extinct genera are, _Cynodictis_, _Cyotherium_, and _Galethylax_,\r\nfrom the Eocene of France; _Pseudocyon_, _Simocyon_, and _Hemicyon_, from\r\nthe Miocene; but all these show transition characters to Viverridæ or\r\nUrsidæ, and do not perhaps belong to the present family.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY 29.--MUSTELIDÆ.

They may be divided into three\r\nsub-families--one, the Mustelinæ, containing the weasels, gluttons, and\r\nallied forms; a second, the Lutrinæ, containing the otters; and a third,\r\noften considered a distinct family, the Melininæ, containing the badgers,\r\nratels, skunks, and their allies.\r\n\r\nIn the first group (Mustelinæ) the genera _Martes_ and _Putorius_ (13\r\nspecies), range over all the Palæarctic region, and a considerable part of\r\nthe Oriental, extending through India to Ceylon, and to Java and Borneo.\r\nTwo species of _Martes_ (= _Mustela_ of Baird) occur in the United States.\r\nThe weasels, forming the genus _Mustela_ (20 species), have a still wider\r\nrange, extending into tropical Africa and the Cordilleras of Peru, but\r\n{199}not going south of the Himalayas in India. The North American species\r\nare placed in the genus _Putorius_ by Professor Baird. An allied genus,\r\n_Gymnopus_ (4 species), is confined to the third and fourth Oriental\r\nsub-regions. _Gulo_ (1 species), the glutton, is an arctic animal keeping\r\nto the cold regions of Europe and Asia, and coming as far south as the\r\ngreat lakes in North America. _Galictis_ (2 species), the grisons, are\r\nconfined to the Neotropical region.\r\n\r\nThe Otters (Lutrinæ) range over the whole area occupied by the family. They\r\nhave been subdivided into a number of groups, such as _Barangia_ (1\r\nspecies), found only in Sumatra; _Lontra_, containing 3 South American\r\nspecies; _Lutra_ (7 species), ranging over the whole of the Palæarctic and\r\nOriental regions; _Nutria_ (1 species), a sea-otter confined to the west\r\ncoast of America from California to Chiloe; _Lutronectes_ (1 species), from\r\nJapan only; _Aonyx_ (5 species), found in West and South Africa, and the\r\nthird and fourth Oriental sub-regions. _Hydrogale_ (1 species), confined to\r\nSouth Africa; _Latax_ (2 species), Florida and California to Canada and\r\nBritish Columbia; _Pteronura_ (1 species), Brazil and Surinam; and\r\n_Enhydris_ (1 species), the peculiar sea-otter of California, Kamschatka\r\nand Japan. The last two are the only groups of otters, besides _Lutra_,\r\nadmitted by Professor Carus as genera.\r\n\r\nThe Badgers and allies (Melininæ) have also a wide range, but with one\r\nexception are absent from South America. They comprise the following\r\ngenera: _Arctonyx_ (1 species), Nepal to Aracan; _Meles_ (4 species), North\r\nEurope to Japan, and China as far south as Hongkong (Plate I., vol. i., p.\r\n195); _Taxidea_ (2 species), Central and Western North America to 58° N.\r\nLat.; _Mydaus_ (1 species), mountains of Java and Sumatra; _Melivora_ (3\r\nspecies), Tropical and South Africa and India to foot of Himalayas;\r\n_Mephitis_ (12 species), America from Canada and British Columbia to the\r\nStraits of Magellan (Plate XX., vol. ii., p. 136). _Ictonyx_ (2 species),\r\nTropical Africa to the Cape; _Helictis_ (4 species), Nepal to Java, Formosa\r\nand Shanghai (Plate VII., vol. i. p. 331).\r\n\r\n_Fossil Mustelidæ._--Species of otter, weasel, badger, and glutton, occur\r\nin European bone caves and other Post-tertiary deposits; and in North\r\nAmerica _Galictis_, now found only in the Neotropical region, and, with\r\n_Mephitis_, occurring in Brazilian caves.\r\n\r\n{200}Species of _Mustela_ have been found in the Pliocene of France and of\r\nSouth America; and _Lutra_ in the Pliocene of North America.\r\n\r\nIn the Miocene deposits of Europe several species of _Mustela_ and _Lutra_\r\nhave been found; with the extinct genera _Taxodon_, _Potamotherium_, and\r\n_Palæomephitis_; as well as _Promephitis_ in Greece.\r\n\r\nIn the Upper Miocene of the Siwalik Hills species of _Lutra_ and\r\n_Mellivora_ are found, as well as the extinct genera _Enhydrion_ and\r\n_Ursitaxus_.\r\n\r\nThe family appears to have been unknown in North America during the Miocene\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY 30.--PROCYONIDÆ.

The genus _Phoca_ and its close allies, as well as _Halichoerus_\r\nand _Pelagius_, are {204}northern; while _Stenorhynchus_ and _Morunga_,\r\nwith their allies, are mostly southern. The genera admitted by Dr. Gray in\r\nhis catalogue are as follows:--\r\n\r\n_Callocephalus_ (3 species), Greenland, North Sea, also the Caspian Sea,\r\nand Lakes Aral and Baikal; _Pagomys_ (2 species), North Sea, North Pacific,\r\nand Japan; _Pagophilus_ (2 species), North Pacific and North Atlantic;\r\n_Halicyon_ (1 species), North West coast of America; _Phoca_ (2 species),\r\nNorth Atlantic and North Pacific, Japan; _Halichoerus_ (1 species),\r\nGreenland, North Sea, and Baltic; _Pelagius_ (2 species), Madeira,\r\nMediterranean, Black Sea; _Stenorhynchus_ (1 species), Antarctic Ocean,\r\nFalkland Islands, New Zealand; _Lobodon_ (1 species), Antarctic Ocean;\r\n_Leptonyx_ (1 species), Antarctic Ocean, South Australia, East Patagonia;\r\n_Ommatophoca_ (1 species), Antarctic Ocean; _Morunga_ (2 species),\r\nCalifornia, Falkland Islands, Temperate regions of Southern Ocean;\r\n_Cystophora_ (2 species), North Atlantic, Antilles.\r\n\r\n_Fossil Seals._--Remains of living species of seals have been found in\r\nPost-tertiary deposits in many parts of Europe and in Algeria, as well as\r\nin New Zealand. _Pristiphoca occitana_ is a fossil seal from the Pliocene\r\nof Montpellier, while a species of _Phoca_ is said to have been found in\r\nthe Miocene deposits of the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n_General Remarks on the Distribution of the Carnivora._\r\n\r\n_Terrestrial Carnivora._--For the purposes of geographical distribution,\r\nthe terrestrial and aquatic Carnivora differ too widely to be considered in\r\none view, their areas being limited by barriers of a very different nature.\r\nThe terrestrial Carnivora form a very extensive and considerably varied\r\ngroup of animals, having, with the doubtful exception of Australia, a\r\nworld-wide distribution. Yet the range of modification of form is not very\r\ngreat, and the occurrence of three families consisting of but one species\r\neach, is an indication of a great amount of recent extinction. One of the\r\nmost marked features presented by this group is its comparative scarcity in\r\nthe Neotropical region, only four families being represented there (not\r\ncounting the Ursidæ, which has only one Andean species), and both genera\r\nand species are few in number. Even the Procyonidæ, which are especially\r\nSouth {205}American, have but two genera and six species in that vast area.\r\nWe might therefore, from these considerations alone, conclude that\r\nCarnivora are a development of the northern hemisphere, and have been\r\nintroduced into the Neotropical region at a comparatively recent epoch. The\r\nclaim of the Nearctic region to be kept distinct from the Palæarctic (with\r\nwhich some writers have wished to unite it) is well maintained by its\r\npossession of at least six species of _Mephitis_, or skunk, a group having\r\nno close allies in any other region,--and the genera _Procyon_ and\r\n_Bassaris_,--for the latter, ranging from the high lands of Guatemala and\r\nMexico to Texas and California, may be considered a Nearctic rather than a\r\nNeotropical form. In the other families, the most marked feature is the\r\ntotal absence of Ursidæ from the Ethiopian region. The great mass of the\r\ngeneric forms of Carnivora, however, are found in the Oriental and\r\nEthiopian regions, which possess all the extensive group of Viverridæ\r\n(except a few species in the fourth Palæarctic sub-region) and a large\r\nnumber of Felidæ and Mustelidæ.\r\n\r\n_Aquatic Carnivora._--The aquatic Carnivora present no very marked features\r\nof distribution, except their preference for cold and temperate rather than\r\ntropical seas. Their nearest approximation to the terrestrial group, is\r\nsupposed to be that of the Otariidæ to the Ursidæ; but this must be very\r\nremote, and the occurrence of both seals and bears in the Miocene period,\r\nshows, that until we find some late Secondary or early Tertiary formation\r\nrich in Mammalian remains, we are not likely to get at the transition forms\r\nindicating the steps by which the aquatic Carnivora were developed. The\r\nmost interesting special fact of distribution to be noticed, is the\r\noccurrence of seals, closely allied to those inhabiting the northern seas,\r\nin the Caspian, Lake Aral, and Lake Baikal. In the case of the two\r\nfirst-named localities there is little difficulty, as they are connected\r\nwith the North Sea by extensive plains of low elevation, so that a\r\ndepression of less than 500 feet would open a free communication with the\r\nocean. At a comparatively recent epoch, a great gulf of the Arctic ocean\r\nmust have occupied the valley of the Irtish, and extended to the Caspian\r\nSea; till the elevation of the Kirghiz Steppes cut off the\r\n{206}communication with the ocean, leaving an inland sea with its seals.\r\nLake Baikal, however, offers much greater difficulties; since it is not\r\nonly a fresh-water lake, but is situated in a mountain district nearly\r\n2,000 feet above the sea level, and entirely separated from the plains by\r\nseveral hundred miles of high land. It is true that such an amount of\r\nsubmergence and elevation is known to have occurred in Europe so recently\r\nas during the Glacial period; but Lake Baikal is so surrounded by\r\nmountains, that it must at that time have been filled with ice, if at\r\nanything like its present elevation. Its emergence from the sea must\r\ntherefore have taken place since the cold epoch, and this would imply that\r\nan enormous extent of Northern Asia has been very recently under water.\r\n\r\nWe are accustomed to look on Seals as animals which exclusively inhabit\r\nsalt water; but it is probably from other causes than its saltness that\r\nthey usually keep to the open sea, and there seems no reason why\r\nfresh-water should not suit them quite as well, provided they find in it a\r\nsufficiency of food, facilities for rearing their young, and freedom from\r\nthe attacks of enemies. As already remarked in vol. i. p. 218, Mr. Belt's\r\ningenious hypothesis (founded on personal examination of the Siberian\r\nSteppes), that during the Glacial period the northern ice-cap dammed up the\r\nwaters of the northward flowing Asiatic rivers, and thus formed a vast\r\nfresh-water lake which might have risen as high as Lake Baikal, seems to\r\noffer the best solution of this curious problem of distribution.\r\n\r\n_Range of Carnivora in Time._--Carnivora have been found in all the\r\nTertiary deposits, and comprise a number of extinct genera and even\r\nfamilies. Several genera of Canidæ occur in the Upper Eocene of Europe; but\r\nthe most remarkable fact is, that even in the Lower Eocene are found two\r\nwell-marked forms, _Palæonyctis_, one of the Viverridæ, and _Arctocyon_,\r\nforming a distinct family type of very generalized characters, but\r\nunmistakably a carnivore. This last has been found at La Fère, in the\r\nnorth-east of France, in a deposit which, according to M. Gaudry, is the\r\nvery lowest of the Lower Eocene formation in Europe. _Arctocyon_ is\r\ntherefore one of the oldest, if not the very oldest, of the higher forms of\r\nmammal yet discovered.\r\n\r\n\r\n{207}_Order V.--CETACEA._\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY 36.--BALÆNIDÆ.

Allied species are\r\nfound in all parts of the southern seas, as far north as the Cape of Good\r\nHope; while some of the northern species are found off the coast of Spain,\r\nand even enter the Mediterranean.

They are abundant in all northern seas, less so in the southern\r\nhemisphere, but they seem occasionally to enter the tropical seas. The best\r\nknown genera are _Megaptera_ (7 species); _Physalus_ (4 species); and\r\n_Balænoptera_ (2 species); all of which have species in the North Sea.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY 38.--CATODONTIDÆ.

They are pre-eminently a tropical, as distinguished from the two\r\npreceding which are {208}arctic and antarctic families. The spermaceti\r\nwhale (_Catodon macrocephalus_) abounds in the Pacific Ocean and in the\r\ndeep Moluccan Sea, and also in the Indian Ocean and the Mozambique Channel.\r\nIn the Atlantic it is scarce, although it occasionally comes north as far\r\nas our shores.\r\n\r\nThe genera of Catodontidæ as given by Dr. Gray are, _Catodon_ (2 species?),\r\nWarm Eastern Oceans; _Physeter_ (1 species), \"the black fish,\" North Sea;\r\n_Cogia_ (2 species), South Temperate Oceans; _Euphysetes_ (1 species),\r\nCoast of Australia.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY 39.--HYPEROODONTIDÆ.

In the Lower Pliocene of England, France, and\r\nGermany, extinct species of five or six living genera of whales and\r\ndolphins have been found; and most of these occur also in the Upper\r\nMiocene, along with many others, referred to about a dozen extinct genera.\r\n\r\nIn the Post-pliocene deposits of Vermont and South Carolina, several\r\nextinct species have been found belonging to living genera; but in the\r\nMiocene deposits of the Eastern United States cetacean remains are much\r\nmore abundant, more than 30 species of {210}extinct whales and dolphins\r\nhaving been described, most of them belonging to extinct genera.\r\n\r\nThe Zeuglodontidæ, an extinct family of carnivorous whales, with\r\ndouble-fanged serrated molar teeth, whose affinities are somewhat doubtful,\r\nare found in the older Pliocene of Europe, and in the Miocene and Eocene of\r\nthe Eastern United States. _Zeuglodon_ abounds in the United States, and\r\none species reached a length of seventy feet. A species of this genus is\r\nsaid to have been found in Malta. _Squalodon_ occurs in Europe and North\r\nAmerica; and in the latter country four or five other genera have been\r\ndescribed, of which one, _Saurocetes_, has been found also at Buenos Ayres.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Order VI.--SIRENIA._\r\n\r\nFAMILY 42.--MANATIDÆ.

The zebras (3 species) inhabit\r\nthe greater part of the Ethiopian region, while the asses (4 species) are\r\ncharacteristic of the deserts of the Palæarctic region from North Africa\r\nand Syria to Western India, Mongolia, and Manchuria. The domestic horse is\r\nnot known in a wild state, but its remains are found in recent deposits\r\nfrom Britain to the Altai Mountains, so that its disappearance is probably\r\ndue to human agency.\r\n\r\n_Extinct Equidæ._--Extinct forms of this family are very numerous. The\r\ngenus _Equus_ occurs in Post-pliocene and Pliocene deposits in Europe,\r\nNorth America, and South America. In North America the species are most\r\nnumerous. An allied genus _Hipparion_, having rudimentary lateral toes, is\r\nrepresented {212}by several species in the Pliocene of North America, while\r\nin Europe it occurs both in the Older Pliocene and Upper Miocene. Various\r\nother allied forms, in which the lateral toes are more and more developed,\r\nand most of which are now classed in a distinct family, Anchitheridæ, range\r\nback through the Miocene to the Eocene period. A sufficient account of\r\nthese has already been given in vol. i. chap. vi. p. 135, to which the\r\nreader is referred for the supposed origin and migrations of the horse.\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily 44--TAPIRIDÆ.

For a long time only two\r\nspecies were known, the black American, and the white-banded Malay tapir,\r\nthe former confined to the equatorial forests of South America, the latter\r\nto the Malay peninsula, Sumatra, and Borneo (Plate VIII. vol. i. p. 337).\r\nLately however another, or perhaps two distinct species (or according to\r\nDr. J. E. Gray, four!) have been discovered in the Andes of New Granada and\r\nEcuador, at an elevation of from 8,000 to 12,000 feet; while one or perhaps\r\ntwo more, forming the allied genus _Elasmognathus_, have been found to\r\ninhabit Central America from Panama to Guatemala.\r\n\r\n_Extinct Tapirs._--True tapirs inhabited Western Europe, from the latest\r\nPliocene back to the earliest Miocene times; while they only occur in\r\neither North or South America in the Post-pliocene deposits and caves. The\r\nsingular distribution of the living species is thus explained, since we see\r\nthat they are an Old World group which only entered the American continent\r\nat a comparatively recent epoch. An ancestral form of this\r\ngroup--_Lophiodon_--is found in Miocene and Eocene deposits of {213}Europe\r\nand North America; while a still more ancient form of large size is found\r\nin the Lower Eocene of France and England, indicating an immense antiquity\r\nfor this group of Mammalia. There are many other extinct forms connecting\r\nthese with the Palæotheridæ, already noticed in chapter vi. (vol. i. pp.\r\n119-125).\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY 45.--RHINOCEROTIDÆ.

Four or perhaps five species, all two-horned, are found\r\nin Africa, where they range over the whole country south of the desert to\r\nthe Cape of Good Hope. In the Oriental region there are also four or five\r\nspecies, which range from the forests at the foot of the Himalayas\r\neastwards through Assam, Chittagong, and Siam, to Sumatra, Borneo and Java.\r\nThree of these are one-horned, the others found in Sumatra, and northwards\r\nto Pegu and Chittagong, two-horned. The Asiatic differ from the African\r\nspecies in some dental characters, but they are in other respects so much\r\nalike that they are not generally considered to form distinct genera. In\r\nhis latest catalogue however (1873), Dr. Gray has four genera, _Rhinoceros_\r\n(4 species), and _Ceratorhinus_ (2 species), Asiatic; _Rhinaster_ (2\r\nspecies), and _Ceratotherium_ (2 species), African.\r\n\r\n_Extinct Rhinocerotidæ._--Numerous species of _Rhinoceros_ ranged over\r\nEurope and Asia from the Post-pliocene back to the Upper Miocene period,\r\nand in North America during the Pliocene period {214}only. The hornless\r\n_Acerotherium_ is Miocene only, in both countries. Other genera are\r\n_Leptodon_ from Greece, and _Hyracodon_ from Nebraska, both of Miocene age.\r\nMore than 20 species of extinct rhinoceroses are known, and one has even\r\nbeen found at an altitude of 16,000 feet in Thibet.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY 46.--HIPPOPOTAMIDÆ.

The Dicotylinæ, or {215}peccaries (1 genus,\r\n_Dicotyles_). These offer so many structural differences that they are\r\noften classed as a separate family. 2. The true swine (3 genera, _Sus_,\r\n_Potamochoerus_, and _Babirusa_); and, 3. The Phacochoerinæ, or wart hogs\r\n(1 genus, _Phacochoerus_). These last are also sometimes made into a\r\nseparate family, but they are hardly so distinct as the Dicotylinæ.\r\n\r\nThe Peccaries (2 species), are peculiar to the Neotropical region,\r\nextending from Mexico to Paraguay. They also spread northwards into Texas,\r\nand as far as the Red River of Arkansas, thus just entering the Nearctic\r\nregion; but with this exception swine are wholly absent from this region,\r\nforming an excellent feature by which to differentiate it from the\r\nPalæarctic.\r\n\r\n_Sus_ (14 species), ranges over the Palæarctic and Oriental regions and\r\ninto the first Australian sub-region as far as New Guinea; but it is absent\r\nfrom the Ethiopian region, or barely enters it on the north-east.\r\n_Potamochoerus_ (3 species?), is wholly Ethiopian (Plate V. vol. i. p.\r\n278). _Babirusa_ (1 species), is confined to two islands, Celebes and\r\nBouru, in the first Australian sub-region.\r\n\r\n_Phacochoerus_ (2 species), ranges over tropical Africa from Abyssinia to\r\nCaffraria.\r\n\r\nDr. J. E. Gray divides true swine (_Sus_) into 7 genera, but it seems far\r\nbetter to keep them as one.\r\n\r\n_Fossil Suidæ._--These are very numerous. Many extinct species of wild hog\r\n(_Sus_), are found in Europe and North India, ranging back from the\r\nPost-pliocene to the Upper Miocene formations. In the Miocene of Europe are\r\nnumerous extinct genera, _Bothriodon_, _Anthracotherium_, _Palæochoerus_,\r\n_Hyotherium_, and some others; while in the Upper Eocene occur\r\n_Cebochoerus_, _Choeropotamus_, and _Acotherium_,--these early forms having\r\nmore resemblance to the peccaries.\r\n\r\nNone of these genera are found in America, where we have the living genus\r\n_Dicotyles_ in the Post-pliocene and Pliocene deposits, both of North and\r\nSouth America; with a number of extinct genera in the Miocene. The chief of\r\nthese are, _Elotherium_, _Perchoerus_, _Leptochoerus_, and _Nanohyus_, all\r\nfrom Dakota, and _Thinohyus_, from Oregon. One extinct genus, _Platygonus_,\r\nclosely allied to _Dicotyles_, is found in the Post-pliocene of Nebraska,\r\n{216}Oregon, and Arkansas. _Elotherium_ is said to be allied to the peccary\r\nand hippopotamus. _Hyopotamus_, from the Miocene of Dakota, is allied to\r\n_Anthracotherium_, and forms with it (according to Dr. Leidy) a distinct\r\nfamily of ancestral swine.\r\n\r\nIt thus appears, that the swine were almost equally well represented in\r\nNorth America and Europe, during Miocene and Pliocene times, but by\r\nentirely distinct forms; and it is a remarkable fact that these hardy\r\nomnivorous animals, should, like the horses, have entirely died out in\r\nNorth America, except a few peccaries which have preserved themselves in\r\nthe sub-tropical parts and in the southern continent, to which they are\r\ncomparatively recent emigrants. We can hardly have a more convincing proof\r\nof the vast physical changes that have occurred in the North American\r\ncontinent during the Pliocene and Post-pliocene epochs, than the complete\r\nextinction of these, along with so many other remarkable types of Mammalia.\r\n\r\nAccording to M. Gaudry, the ancestors of all the swine, with the\r\nhippopotami and extinct _Anthracotherium_, _Merycopotamus_, and many allied\r\nforms,--are the _Hyracotherium_ and _Pliolophus_, both found only in the\r\nLondon clay belonging to the Lower Eocene formation.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY 48.--CAMELIDÆ.

The genus _Camelus_ (2\r\nspecies), is a highly characteristic desert form {217}of the Palæarctic\r\nregion, from the Sahara to Mongolia as far as Lake Baikal. _Auchenia_ (4\r\nspecies), comprehending the Llamas and Alpacas, is equally characteristic\r\nof the mountains and deserts of the southern part of South America. Two\r\nspecies entirely domesticated inhabit the Peruvian and Bolivian Andes; and\r\ntwo others are found in a wild state, the vicuna in the Andes of Peru and\r\nChili (Plate XVI. vol. ii. p. 40), and the guanaco over the plains of\r\nPatagonia and Tierra del Fuego.\r\n\r\n_Extinct Camelidæ._--No fossil remains of camels have been found in Europe,\r\nbut one occurs in the deposits of the Siwalik Hills, usually classed as\r\nUpper Miocene, but which some naturalists think are more likely of Older\r\nPliocene age. _Merycotherium_, teeth of which have been found in the\r\nSiberian drift, is supposed to belong to this family.\r\n\r\nIn North America, where no representative of the family now exists, the\r\ncamel-tribe were once abundant. In the Post-pliocene deposits of California\r\nan _Auchenia_ has been found, and in those of Kansas one of the extinct\r\ngenus _Procamelus_. In the Pliocene period, this genus, which was closely\r\nallied to the living camels, abounded, six or seven species having been\r\ndescribed from Nebraska and Texas, together with an allied form\r\n_Homocamelus_. In the Miocene period different genera\r\nappear,--_Poebrotherium_, and _Protomeryx_,--while a _Procamelus_ has been\r\nfound in deposits of this age in Virginia.\r\n\r\nIn South America a species of _Auchenia_ has been found in the caves of\r\nBrazil, and others in the Pliocene deposits of the pampas, together with\r\ntwo extinct genera, _Palæolama_ and _Camelotherium_.\r\n\r\nWe thus find the ancestors of the Camelidæ in a region where they do not\r\nnow exist, but which is situated so that the now widely separated living\r\nforms could easily have been derived from it. This case offers a remarkable\r\nexample of the light thrown by palæontology on the distribution of living\r\nanimals; and it is a warning against the too common practice of assuming\r\nthe direct land connection of remote continents, in order to explain\r\nsimilar instances of discontinuous distribution to that of the present\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\n\r\n{218}FAMILY 49.--TRAGULIDÆ.

Milne-Edwards,\r\nhas shown it to be more nearly allied to the true deer. The Chevrotains, or\r\nmouse-deer, _Tragulus_ (5 species), range over all India to the foot of the\r\nHimalayas and Ceylon, and through Assam, Malacca, and Cambodja, to Sumatra,\r\nBorneo, and Java (Plate VIII., vol. i. p. 337). _Hyomoschus_ (1 species),\r\nis found in West Africa.\r\n\r\n_Extinct Tragulidæ._--A species of _Hyomoschus_ is said to have been found\r\nin the Miocene of the South of France, as well as three extinct genera,\r\n_Dremotherium_ (also found in Greece), with _Lophiomeryx_ from the Upper\r\nMiocene, said to be allied to _Tragulus_; and _Amphitragulus_ from the\r\nLower Miocene, of more remote affinities, and sometimes placed among the\r\nDeer. There seems to be no doubt, however, that this family existed in\r\nEurope in Miocene times; and thus another case of discontinuous\r\ndistribution is satisfactorily accounted for.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY 50.--CERVIDÆ.

They range in fact over the whole of the great continents of\r\nthe globe, with the one striking exception of Africa, where they are only\r\nfound on the shores of the Mediterranean which form part of the Palæarctic\r\nregion. The following is the distribution of the genera.\r\n\r\n_Alces_ (1 species), the elk or moose, ranges all over Northern Europe and\r\nAsia, as far south as East Prussia, the Caucasus, and North China; and over\r\nArctic America to Maine on the East, and British Columbia on the west. The\r\nAmerican species may however be distinct, although very closely allied to\r\nthat of Europe. _Tarandus_ (1 species), the reindeer, has a similar range\r\nto the last, but keeps farther north in Europe, inhabiting Greenland and\r\nSpitzbergen; and in America extends farther south, to New Brunswick and the\r\nnorth shore of Lake Superior. There are several varieties or species of\r\nthis animal confined to special districts, but they are not yet well\r\ndetermined. _Cervus_ (40 species), the true deer, have been sub-divided\r\ninto numerous sub-genera characteristic of separate districts. They range\r\nover the whole area of the family, except that they do not go beyond 57° N.\r\nin America and a little further in Europe and Asia. In South America they\r\nextend over Patagonia and even to Tierra del Fuego. They are found in the\r\nnorth of Africa, and over the whole of the Oriental region, and beyond it\r\nas far as the Moluccas and Timor, where however they have probably been\r\nintroduced by man at an early period. _Dama_ (1 species), the fallow deer,\r\nis a native of the shores of the Mediterranean, from Spain and Barbary to\r\nSyria. _Capreolus_ (2 species), the roe-deer, inhabits all Temperate and\r\nSouth Europe to Syria, with a distinct species in N. China. _Cervulus_ (4\r\nspecies), the muntjacs, are found in all the forest districts of the\r\nOriental region, from India and Ceylon to China as far north as Ningpo and\r\nFormosa, also southward to the Philippines, Borneo, and Java. _Moschus_ (1\r\nspecies), the musk-deer, inhabits Central Asia from the Amoor and Pekin, to\r\nthe Himalayas and the Siamese mountains above 8000 ft. elevation. This is\r\nusually classed as a distinct family, but M. Milne-Edwards remarks, that it\r\ndiffers in no important points of organisation from the rest of the\r\nCervidæ. _Hydropotes_ {220}(1 species) inhabits China from the Yang-tse\r\nKiang northwards. This new genus has recently been discovered by Mr.\r\nSwinhoe, who says its nearest affinities are with _Moschus_. Other new\r\nforms are _Lophotragus_, and _Elaphodus_, both inhabiting North China; the\r\nformer is hornless, the latter has very small horns about an inch long.\r\n\r\n_Extinct Deer._--Numerous extinct species of the genus _Cervus_ are found\r\nfossil in many parts of Europe, and in all formations between the\r\nPost-pliocene and the Upper Miocene. The Elk and Reindeer are also found in\r\ncaves and Post-pliocene deposits, the latter as far south as the South of\r\nFrance. Extinct genera only, occur in the Upper Miocene in various parts of\r\nEurope:--_Micromeryx_, _Palæomeryx_, and _Dicrocercus_ have been described;\r\nwith others referred doubtfully to _Moschus_, and an allied genus\r\n_Amphimoschus_.\r\n\r\nIn N. America, remains of this family are very scarce, a _Cervus_ allied to\r\nthe existing wapiti deer, being found in Post-pliocene deposits, and an\r\nextinct genus, _Leptomeryx_, in the Upper Miocene of Dakota and Oregon.\r\nAnother extinct genus, _Merycodus_, from the Pliocene of Oregon, is said to\r\nbe allied to camels and deer.\r\n\r\nIn South America, several species of _Cervus_ have been found in the\r\nBrazilian caves, and in the Pliocene deposits of La Plata.\r\n\r\nIt thus appears, that there are not yet sufficient materials for\r\ndetermining the origin and migrations of the Cervidæ. There can be little\r\ndoubt that they are an Old World group, and a comparatively recent\r\ndevelopment; and that some time during the Miocene period they passed to\r\nNorth America, and subsequently to the Southern continent. They do not\r\nhowever appear to have developed much in North America, owing perhaps to\r\ntheir finding the country already amply stocked with numerous forms of\r\nindigenous Ungulates.\r\n\r\n\r\n{221}FAMILY 51.--CAMELOPARDALIDÆ.

Zoologically, they {222}are briefly and accurately defined as,\r\n\"hollow-horned ruminants;\" and, although they present wide differences in\r\nexternal form, they grade so insensibly into each other, that no\r\nsatisfactory definition of the smaller family groups can be found. As a\r\nwhole they are almost confined to the great Old World continent, only a few\r\nforms extending along the highlands and prairies of the Nearctic region;\r\nwhile one peculiar type is found in Celebes, an island which is almost\r\nintermediate between the Oriental and Australian regions. In each of the\r\nOld World regions there are found a characteristic set of types. Antelopes\r\nprevail in the Ethiopian region; sheep and goats in the Palæarctic; while\r\nthe oxen are perhaps best developed in the Oriental region.\r\n\r\nSir Victor Brooke, who has paid special attention to this family, divides\r\nthem into 13 sub-families, and I here adopt the arrangement of the genera\r\nand species which he has been so good as to communicate to me in MSS.\r\n\r\nSub-family I. BOVINÆ (6 genera, 13 species). This group is one of the best\r\nmarked in the family. It comprises the Oxen and Buffaloes with their\r\nallies, and has a distribution very nearly the same as that of the entire\r\nfamily. The genera are as follows: BOS (1 sp.), now represented by our\r\ndomestic cattle, the descendants of the _Bos primigenius_, which ranged\r\nover a large part of Central Europe in the time of the Romans. The\r\nChillingham wild cattle are supposed to be the nearest approach to the\r\noriginal species. _Bison_ (2 sp.), one still wild in Poland and the\r\nCaucasus; the other in North America, ranging over the prairies west of the\r\nMississippi, and on the eastern slopes of the Rocky Mountains (Plate XIX.,\r\nvol. ii., p. 129). _Bibos_ (3 sp.), the Indian wild cattle, ranging over a\r\nlarge part of the Oriental region, from Southern India to Assam, Burmah,\r\nthe Malay Peninsula, Borneo, and Java. _Poephagus_ (1 sp.), the yak,\r\nconfined to the high plains of Western Thibet. _Bubalus_ (5 sp.), the\r\nbuffaloes, of which three species are African, ranging over all the\r\ncontinental parts of the Ethiopian region; one Northern and Central Indian;\r\nand the domesticated animal in South Europe and North Africa. _Anoa_ (1\r\nsp.), the small wild cow of Celebes, {223}a very peculiar form more nearly\r\nallied to the buffaloes than to any other type of oxen.\r\n\r\nSub-family II. TRAGELAPHINÆ: (3 genera, 11 species). The Bovine Antelopes\r\nare large and handsome animals, mostly Ethiopian, but extending into the\r\nadjacent parts of the Palæarctic and Oriental regions. The genera are:\r\n_Oreas_ (2 sp.), elands, inhabiting all Tropical and South Africa.\r\n_Tragelaphus_ (8 sp.), including the bosch-bok, kudu, and other large\r\nantelopes, ranges over all Tropical and South Africa (Plate IV., vol. i.,\r\np. 261). _Portax_ (1 sp.) India, but rare in Madras and north of the\r\nGanges.\r\n\r\nSub-family III. ORYGINÆ: (2 genera, 5 species). _Oryx_ (4 sp.) is a desert\r\ngenus, ranging over all the African deserts to South Arabia and Syria;\r\n_Addax_ (1 sp.) inhabits North Africa, North Arabia, and Syria.\r\n\r\nSub-family IV. HIPPOTRAGINÆ (1 genus, 3 species). The Sable Antelopes,\r\n_Hippotragus_, form an isolated group inhabiting the open country of\r\nTropical Africa and south to the Cape.\r\n\r\nSub-family V. GAZELLINÆ (6 genera, 23 species). This is a group of small or\r\nmoderate-sized animals, most abundant in the deserts on the borders of the\r\nPalæarctic, Oriental, and Ethiopian regions. _Gazella_ (17 sp.) is\r\ntypically a Palæarctic desert group, ranging over the great desert plateaus\r\nof North Africa, from Senegal and Abyssinia to Syria, Persia, Beloochistan,\r\nand the plains of India, with one outlying species in South Africa.\r\n_Procapra_ (2 sp.), Western Thibet and Mongolia to about 110° east\r\nlongitude. _Antilope_ (1 sp.) inhabits all the plains of India. _Æpyceros_\r\n(1 sp.) the pallah, inhabits the open country of South and South-east\r\nAfrica. _Saiga_ (1 sp.) a singular sheep-faced antelope, which inhabits the\r\nsteppes of Eastern Europe and Western Asia from Poland to the Irtish River,\r\nsouth of 55° north latitude. (Plate II., vol. i., p. 218.) _Panthalops_ (1\r\nsp.) confined to the highlands of Western Thibet and perhaps Turkestan.\r\n\r\nSub-family VI. ANTILOCAPRINÆ (1 genus, 1 species), _Antilocapra_, the\r\nprong-horned antelope, inhabit both sides of the Rocky Mountains, extending\r\nnorth to the Saskatchewan and {224}Columbia River, west to the coast range\r\nof California, and east to the Missouri. Its remarkable deciduous horns\r\nseem to indicate a transition to the Cervidæ. (Plate XIX., vol. ii., p.\r\n129.)\r\n\r\nSub-family VII. CERVICAPRINÆ (5 genera, 21 species). This group of\r\nAntelopes is wholly confined to the continental portion of the Ethiopian\r\nregion. The genera are: _Cervicapra_ (4 sp.), Africa, south of the equator\r\nand Abyssinia; _Kobus_ (6 sp.), grassy plains and marshes of Tropical\r\nAfrica; _Pelea_ (1 sp.), South Africa; _Nanotragus_ (9 species), Africa,\r\nsouth of the Sahara; _Neotragus_ (1 sp.) Abyssinia and East Africa.\r\n\r\nSub-family VIII. CEPHALOPHINÆ (2 genera, 24 species), Africa and India;\r\n_Cephalophus_ (22 sp.), continental Ethiopian region; _Tetraceros_ (2 sp.)\r\nhilly part of all India, but rare north of the Ganges.\r\n\r\nSub-family IX. ALCEPHALINÆ (2 genera, 11 species), large African Antelopes,\r\none species just entering the Palæarctic region. The genera are:\r\n_Alcephalus_ (9 sp.) all Africa and north-east to Syria; _Catoblepas_ (2\r\nsp.), gnus, Africa, south of the Equator.\r\n\r\nSub-region X. BUDORCINÆ (1 genus, 2 species) _Budorcas_ inhabits the high\r\nHimalayas from Nepal to East Thibet.\r\n\r\nSub-family XI. RUPICAPRINÆ (1 genus, 2 species) the Chamois, _Rupicapra_,\r\ninhabit the high European Alps from the Pyrenees to the Caucasus. (Plate\r\nI., vol. i., p. 195.)\r\n\r\nSub-family XII. NEMORHEDINÆ (2 genera, 10 species). These goat-like\r\nAntelopes inhabit portions of the Palæarctic and Oriental regions, as well\r\nas the Rocky Mountains in the Nearctic region. _Nemorhedus_ (9 sp.) ranges\r\nfrom the Eastern Himalayas to N. China and Japan, and south to Formosa, the\r\nMalay Peninsula and Sumatra. _Aplocerus_ (1 sp.), the mountain goat of the\r\ntrappers, inhabits the northern parts of California and the Rocky\r\nMountains.\r\n\r\nSub-family XIII. CAPRINÆ (2 genera, 23 species). The Goats and Sheep form\r\nan extensive series, highly characteristic of the Palæarctic region, but\r\nwith an outlying species on the Neilgherries in Southern India, and one in\r\nthe Rocky Mountains and California. The genera are _Capra_ (22 sp.) and\r\n_Ovibos_ (1 sp.). {225}The genus _Capra_ consists of several sub-groups\r\nwhich have been named as genera, but it is unnecessary here to do more than\r\ndivide them into \"Goats and Ibexes\" on the one hand and \"Sheep\" on the\r\nother--each comprising 11 species. The former range over all the South\r\nEuropean Alps from Spain to the Caucasus; to Abyssinia, Persia, and Scinde;\r\nover the high Himalayas to E. Thibet and N. China; with an outlying species\r\nin the Neilgherries. The latter are only found in the mountains of Corsica,\r\nSardinia, and Crete, in Europe; in Asia Minor, Persia, and in Central and\r\nNorth-Eastern Asia, with one somewhat isolated species in the Atlas\r\nmountains; while in America a species is found in the Rocky Mountains and\r\nthe coast range of California. _Ovibos_ (1 sp.), the musk-sheep, inhabits\r\nArctic America north of lat. 60; but it occurs fossil in Post-glacial\r\ngravels on the Yena and Obi in Siberia, in Germany and France along with\r\nthe Mammoth and with flint implements, and in caves of the Reindeer period;\r\nalso in the brick earth in the south of England, associated with\r\n_Rhinoceros megarhinus_ and _Elephas antiquus_.\r\n\r\n_Extinct Bovidæ._--In the caverns and diluviums of Europe, of the\r\nPost-Pliocene period, the remains are found of extinct species of _Bos_,\r\n_Bison_, and _Capra_; and in the caverns of the south of France\r\n_Rupicapra_, and an antelope near _Hippotragus_. _Bos_ and _Bison_ also\r\noccur in Pliocene deposits. In the Miocene of Europe, the only remains are\r\nantelopes closely allied to existing species, and these are especially\r\nnumerous in Greece, where remains referred to two living and four extinct\r\ngenera have been discovered. In the Miocene of India numerous extinct\r\nspecies of _Bos_, and two extinct genera, _Hemibos_ and _Amphibos_, have\r\nbeen found, one of them at a great elevation in Thibet. Antelopes, allied\r\nto living Indian species, are chiefly found in the Nerbudda deposits.\r\n\r\nIn North America, the only bovine remains are those of a _Bison_, and a\r\nsheep or goat, in the Post-pliocene deposits; and of two species of\r\nmusk-sheep, sometimes classed in a distinct genus _Bootherium_, from beds\r\nof the same age in Arkansas and Ohio. _Casoryx_, from the Pliocene of\r\nNebraska, is supposed to be allied to the antelopes and to deer.\r\n\r\n{226}In the caves of Brazil remains of two animals said to be antelopes,\r\nhave been discovered. They are classed by Gervais in the genera _Antilope_\r\nand _Leptotherium_, but the presence of true antelopes in S. America at\r\nthis period is so improbable, that there is probably some error of\r\nidentification.\r\n\r\nThe extinct family Sivatheridæ, containing the extraordinary and gigantic\r\nfour-horned _Sivatherium_ and _Bramatherium_, of the Siwalik deposits, are\r\nmost nearly allied to the antelopes.\r\n\r\nFrom the preceding facts we may conclude, that the great existing\r\ndevelopment of the Bovidæ is comparatively recent. The type may have\r\noriginated early in the Miocene period, the oxen being at first most\r\ntropical, while the antelopes inhabited the desert zone a little further\r\nnorth. The sheep and goats seem to be the most recent development of the\r\nbovine type, which was probably long confined to the Eastern Hemisphere.\r\n\r\n\r\n_General Remarks on the Distribution of the Ungulata._\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the Australian region, from which this order of\r\nmammalia is almost entirely wanting, the Ungulata are almost universally\r\ndistributed over the continental parts of all the other regions. Of the ten\r\nfamilies, 7 are Ethiopian, 6 Oriental, 5 Palæarctic, 4 Neotropical, and 3\r\nNearctic. The Ethiopian region owes its superiority to the exclusive\r\npossession of the hippopotamus and giraffe, both of which inhabited the\r\nPalæarctic and Oriental regions in Miocene times. The excessive poverty of\r\nthe Nearctic region in this order is remarkable; the swine being\r\nrepresented only by _Dicotyles_ in its extreme southern portion, while the\r\nBovidæ are restricted to four isolated species. Deer alone are fairly well\r\nrepresented. But, during the Eocene and Miocene periods, North America was\r\nwonderfully rich in varied forms of Ungulates, of which there were at least\r\n8 or 9 families; while we have reason to believe that during the same\r\nperiods the Ethiopian region was excessively poor, and that it probably\r\nreceived the ancestors of all its existing families from Europe or Western\r\nAsia in later Miocene or Pliocene times. Many types that once abounded in\r\nboth Europe and North America are now preserved only in South America and\r\nCentral or Tropical Asia,--as {227}the tapirs and camels; while others once\r\nconfined to Europe and Asia have found a refuge in Africa,--as the\r\nhippopotamus and giraffe; so that in no other order do we find such\r\nstriking examples of those radical changes in the distribution of the\r\nhigher animals which were effected during the latter part of the Tertiary\r\nperiod. The present distribution of this order is, in fact, utterly\r\nunintelligible without reference to the numerous extinct forms of existing\r\nand allied families; but as this subject has been sufficiently discussed in\r\nthe Second Part of this work (Chapters VI. and VII.) it is unnecessary to\r\ngive further details here.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Order VIII.--PROBOSCIDEA._\r\n\r\nFAMILY 53.--ELEPHANTIDÆ.

These, however, are but the feeble remnants of a host of\r\ngigantic creatures, which roamed over all the great continents except\r\nAustralia during the Tertiary period, and several of which were\r\ncontemporary with man.\r\n\r\n_Extinct Elephants._--At least 14 extinct species of _Elephas_, and a\r\nrather greater number of the allied genus _Mastodon_ (distinguished by\r\ntheir less complex grinding teeth) have now been {228}discovered. Elephants\r\nranged over all the Palæarctic and Nearctic regions in Post-Pliocene times;\r\nin Europe and Central India they go back to the Pliocene; and only in India\r\nto the Upper Miocene period; the number of species increasing as we go back\r\nto the older formations.\r\n\r\nIn North America two or three species of _Mastodon_ are Post-pliocene and\r\nPliocene; and a species is found in the caves of Brazil, and in the\r\nPliocene deposits of the pampas of La Plata, of the Bolivian Andes, and of\r\nHonduras and the Bahamas. In Europe the genus is Upper Miocene and\r\nPliocene, but is especially abundant in the former period.

They are absent from the West Indian islands, Madagascar, and\r\nAustralia, only occurring in Celebes which doubtfully belongs to the\r\nAustralian region. The genera are as follows:--\r\n\r\n{235}_Sciurus_ (100-120 sp., including the sub-genera Spermosciurus, Xerus,\r\nMacroxus, Rheithrosciurus, and Rhinosciurus), comprises the true squirrels,\r\nand occupies the area of the whole family wherever woods and forests occur.\r\nThe approximate number of species in each region is as follows: Nearctic\r\n18, Palæarctic 6, Ethiopian 18, Oriental 50, Australian (Celebes) 5,\r\nNeotropical 30. _Sciuropterus_ (16-19 sp.), comprises the flat-tailed\r\nflying squirrels, which range from Lapland and Finland to North China and\r\nJapan, and southward through India and Ceylon, to Malacca and Java, with a\r\nspecies in Formosa; while in North America they occur from Labrador to\r\nBritish Columbia, and south to Minnesota and Southern California.\r\n_Pteromys_ (12 sp.), comprising the round-tailed flying squirrels, is a\r\nmore southern form, being confined to the wooded regions of India from the\r\nWestern Himalayas to Java and Borneo, with species in Formosa and Japan.\r\n_Tamias_ (5 sp.), the ground squirrels, are chiefly North American, ranging\r\nfrom Mexico to Puget's Sound on the west coast, and from Virginia to\r\nMontreal on the Atlantic coast; while one species is found over all\r\nnorthern Asia. _Spermophilus_ (26 sp.), the pouched marmots, are confined\r\nto the Nearctic and Palæarctic regions; in the former extending from the\r\nArctic Ocean to Mexico and the west coast, but not passing east of Lake\r\nMichigan and the lower Mississippi; in the latter from Silesia through\r\nSouth Russia to the Amoor and Kamschatka, most abundant in the desert\r\nplains of Tartary and Mongolia. _Arctomys_ (8 sp.), the marmots, are found\r\nin the northern parts of North America as far down as Virginia and Nebraska\r\nto the Rocky Mountains and British Columbia, but not in California; and\r\nfrom the Swiss Alps eastward to Lake Baikal and Kamschatka, and south as\r\nfar as the Himalayas, above 8,000 feet elevation. _Cynomys_ (2 sp.), the\r\nprairie-dogs, inhabit the plains east of the Rocky Mountains from the Upper\r\nMissouri to the Red River and Rio Grande (Plate XIX., vol. ii. p. 129).\r\n_Anomalurus_ (5 sp.), consists of animals which resemble flying-squirrels,\r\nbut differ from all other members of the family in some points of internal\r\nstructure. They form a very aberrant portion of the Sciuridæ, and,\r\naccording to some naturalists, a distinct family. They inhabit West Africa\r\nand the island of Fernando Po.\r\n\r\n{236}_Extinct Sciuridæ._--These are tolerably abundant. The genus Sciurus\r\nappears to be a remarkably ancient form, extinct species being found in the\r\nMiocene, and even in the Upper Eocene formations of Europe. _Spermophilus_\r\ngoes back to the Upper Miocene; _Arctomys_ to the Newer Pliocene. Extinct\r\ngenera are, _Brachymys_, _Lithomys_ and _Plesiarctomys_, from the European\r\nMiocene, the latter said to be intermediate between marmots and squirrels.\r\n\r\nIn North America, _Sciurus_, _Tamias_, and _Arctomys_ occur in the\r\nPost-pliocene deposits only. The extinct genera are _Ischyromys_, from the\r\nUpper Miocene of Nebraska; _Paramys_, allied to the marmots, and\r\n_Sciuravus_, near the squirrels, from the Eocene of Wyoming.\r\n\r\nHere we have unmistakable evidence that the true squirrels (_Sciurus_) are\r\nan Old World type, which has only recently entered North America; and this\r\nis in accordance with the comparative scarcity of this group in South\r\nAmerica, a country so well adapted to them, and their great abundance in\r\nthe Oriental region, which, with the Palæarctic, was probably the country\r\nof their origin and early development.

The most remarkable point in their distribution\r\nis, that two genera are peculiar to the West Indian islands, while no\r\nspecies of the family inhabits the northern half of South America. The\r\ndistribution of the genera is as follows:--_Habrocomus_ (2 sp.), Chili;\r\n_Capromys_ (3 sp.), two of which inhabit Cuba, the third Jamaica (Plate\r\nXVII. vol. ii. p. 67); _Plagiodontia_ (1 sp.), only known from _Hayti_;\r\n_Spalacopus_, including _Schizodon_ (2 sp.), Chili, and east side of\r\nSouthern Andes; _Octodon_ (3 sp.), Peru, Bolivia, and Chili; _Ctenomys_ (6\r\nsp.), the tuco-tuco of the Pampas, the Campos of Brazil to Bolivia and\r\nTierra del Fuego; _Ctenodactylus_ (1 sp.), Tripoli, North Africa;\r\n_Pectinator_ (1 sp.), East Africa, Abyssinia, 4,000 to 5,000 feet.\r\n\r\n_Capromys_ and _Plagiodontia_, the two West Indian genera, were classed\r\namong the Echimyidæ by Mr. Waterhouse, but Professor Lilljeborg removes\r\nthem to this family.\r\n\r\n_Extinct Octodontidæ._--Species of _Ctenomys_ have been found in the\r\nPliocene of La Plata, and an extinct genus _Megamys_, said to be allied to\r\n_Capromys_, in the Eocene of the same country.

Two of the genera are found in South Africa, but all the rest\r\ninhabit the continent of South America, East of the Andes, none being yet\r\nknown north {239}of Panama.

We may conclude therefore that this is probably a South American\r\ntype, which has thence spread into North America at a comparatively recent\r\nepoch. The peculiar distribution of _Cercolabes_ may be explained by\r\nsupposing it to have migrated northwards along the west coast by means of\r\nthe wooded slopes of the Rocky Mountains. It could then only reach the\r\nEastern States by way of the forest region of the great lakes, and then\r\nmove southward. This it may be now doing, but it has not yet reached the\r\nSouthern States of Eastern North America.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Family_ 67.--HYSTRICIDÆ.

They are found in every part of the\r\nPalæarctic region, from Ireland to Japan; three species range over all\r\nIndia to Ceylon, and others occur in Hainan, Formosa, South China, and the\r\nmountains of Pegu; the Ethiopian region has only four or five species,\r\nmostly in the southern extremity and along the East coast.

Of the sixteen families which compose\r\nit, the Palæarctic region has 10; the Ethiopian, Nearctic, and Neotropical,\r\neach 9; and the Oriental only 5. These figures are very curious and\r\nsuggestive. We know that the rodentia are exceedingly ancient, since some\r\nof the living genera date back to the Eocene period; and some ancestral\r\ntypes might thus have reached the remote South American and South African\r\nlands at the time of one of their earliest unions with the northern\r\ncontinents. In both these countries the rodents diverged into many special\r\nforms, and being small animals easily able to conceal themselves, have\r\nlargely survived the introduction of higher Mammalia. In the Palæarctic and\r\nNearctic regions, their small size and faculty of hibernation may have\r\nenabled them to maintain themselves during those great physical changes\r\nwhich resulted in the extermination or banishment of so many of the larger\r\nand more highly organised Mammalia, to which, in these regions, they now\r\nbear a somewhat inordinate proportion. The reasons why they are now less\r\nnumerous and varied in the Oriental region, may be of two kinds. The\r\ncomparatively small area of that region and its {244}uniformity of climate,\r\nwould naturally lead to less development of such a group as this, than in\r\nthe vastly more extensive and varied and almost equally luxuriant\r\nPalæarctic region of Eocene and Miocene times; while on the other hand the\r\ngreater number of the smaller Carnivora in the tropics during the Pliocene\r\nand Post-Pliocene epochs, would be a constant check upon the increase of\r\nthese defenceless animals, and no doubt exterminate a number of them.\r\n\r\nThe Rodents thus offer a striking contrast to the Ungulates; and these two\r\ngreat orders afford an admirable illustration of the different way in which\r\nphysical and organic changes may affect large and small herbivorous\r\nMammalia; often leading to the extinction of the former, while favouring\r\nthe comparative development of the latter.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Order XI.--EDENTATA._\r\n\r\nFAMILY 71.--BRADYPODIDÆ.

It is said to be allied to _Myrmecophaga_ and _Manis_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_General Remarks on the Distribution of the Edentata._\r\n\r\nThese singular animals are almost confined to South America, where they\r\nconstitute an important part of the fauna. In Africa, two family types are\r\nscantily represented, and one of these extends over all the Oriental\r\nregion. In Pliocene and Post-Pliocene times the Edentata were wonderfully\r\ndeveloped in South America, many of them being huge animals, rivalling in\r\nbulk, the rhinoceros and hippopotamus. As none of these forms resemble\r\nthose of Africa, while the only European fossil Edentata are of African\r\ntype, it seems probable that South Africa, like South America, was a centre\r\nof development for this group of mammalia; and it is in the highest degree\r\nprobable that, should extensive fluviatile deposits of Pliocene or Miocene\r\nage be discovered in the former country, an extinct fauna, not less strange\r\nand grotesque than that of South America, will be brought to {248}light.\r\nFrom the fact that so few remains of this order occur in Europe, and those\r\nof one family type, and in Miocene deposits only, it seems a fair\r\nconclusion, that this represents an incursion of an ancient Ethiopian form\r\ninto Europe analogous to that which invaded North America from the south\r\nduring the Post-Pliocene epoch. The extension of the Manididæ, or scaly\r\nant-eaters, over tropical Asia may have occurred at the same, or a somewhat\r\nlater epoch.\r\n\r\nFor a summary of the Numerous Edentata of North and South America which\r\nbelong to extinct families, see vol. i. p. 147.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Order XII.--MARSUPIALIA._\r\n\r\nFAMILY 76.--DIDELPHYIDÆ.

Lat., where a species\r\nof _Didelphys_ was obtained by Professor Cunningham. One species only is\r\nfound in the Nearctic region, extending from Florida to the Hudson River,\r\nand west to the Missouri. The species named _Didelphys californica_\r\ninhabits Mexico, and only extends into the southern extremity of\r\nCalifornia. The species are most numerous in the great forest region of\r\nBrazil, and they have been recently found to the west of the Andes near\r\nGuayaquil, as well as in Chili. The exact number of species is very\r\ndoubtful, owing to the difficulty of determining them from dried skins. All\r\nbut two belong to the genus _Didelphys_, which has the range above given\r\nfor the family (Plate XIV., vol. ii. p. 24); _Chironectes_ (1 sp.), the\r\nyapock or water opossum, inhabits Guiana and Brazil; _Hyracodon_ (1 sp.),\r\nis a small {249}rat-like animal discovered by Mr. Fraser in Ecuador, and\r\nwhich may perhaps belong to another family.\r\n\r\n_Extinct Didelphyidæ._--No less than seven species of _Didelphys_ have been\r\nfound in the caves of Brazil, but none in the older formations. In North\r\nAmerica the living species only, has been found in Post-Pliocene deposits.\r\nIn Europe, however, many species of small opossums, now classed as a\r\ndistinct genus, _Peratherium_, have been found in various Tertiary deposits\r\nfrom the Upper Miocene to the Upper Eocene.\r\n\r\nWe have here a sufficient proof that the American Marsupials have nothing\r\nto do with those of Australia, but were derived from Europe, where their\r\nancestors lived during a long series of ages.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY 77.--DASYURIDÆ.

We have the clumsy-looking tail-less koala, or native\r\nsloth; the prehensile-tailed opossum-like phalangers; the beautiful flying\r\noppossums, so closely resembling {252}in form the flying squirrels of North\r\nAmerica and India, but often no larger than a mouse; the beautiful\r\ndormouse-like _Dromiciæ_, one species of which is only 2¼ inches long or\r\nless than the harvest-mouse; and the little _Tarsipes_, a true honey-sucker\r\nwith an extensile tongue, and of the size of a mouse. These extreme\r\nmodifications and specializations within the range of a single family, are\r\nsufficient to indicate the great antiquity of the Australian fauna; and\r\nthey render it almost certain that the region it occupied was once much\r\nmore extensive, so as to supply the variety of conditions and the struggle\r\nbetween competing forms of life, which would be required to develop so many\r\ncuriously modified forms, of which we now probably see only a remnant.\r\n\r\nThe Phalangistidæ not only range over all Australia and Tasmania, but over\r\nthe whole of the Austro-Malayan sub-region from New Guinea to the Moluccas\r\nand Celebes. The distribution of the genera is as follows:--_Phascolarctos_\r\n(1 sp.), the koala, East Australia; _Phalangista_ (5 sp.), East, South, and\r\nWest Australia, and Tasmania; _Cuscus_ (8 sp.), woolly phalangers, New\r\nGuinea, North Australia, Timor, Moluccas and Celebes; _Petaurista_ (1 sp.)\r\nlarge flying phalanger, East Australia; _Belideus_ (5 sp.), flying\r\nopossums, South, East, and North Australia, New Guiana and Moluccas;\r\n_Acrobata_ (1 sp.), pigmy flying opossum, South and East Australia;\r\n_Dromicia_ (5 sp.), dormouse-phalangers, West and East Australia, and\r\nTasmania; _Tarsipes_ (1 sp.), West Australia.\r\n\r\n_Thylacoleo_, a large extinct marsupial of doubtful affinities, seems to be\r\nsomewhat intermediate between this family and the kangaroos. Professor Owen\r\nconsidered it to be carnivorous, and able to prey upon the huge\r\n_Diprotodon_, while Professor Flower and Mr. Gerard Krefft, believe that it\r\nwas herbivorous.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY 82.--PHASCOLOMYIDÆ.

It has been already shown\r\nthat these are comparatively recent immigrants, which have survived in that\r\ncountry long after they disappeared in Europe. As, however, no other form\r\nbut that of the Didelphyidæ occurs there during the Tertiary period, we\r\nmust suppose that it was at a far more remote epoch that the ancestral\r\nforms of all the other Marsupials entered Australia; and the curious little\r\nmammals of the Oolite and Trias, offer valuable indications as to the time\r\nwhen this really took place.\r\n\r\nA notice of these extinct marsupials of the secondary period will be found\r\nat vol. i. p. 159.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Order XIII.--MONOTREMATA._\r\n\r\nFAMILY 83.--ORNITHORHYNCHIDÆ.

It abounds most in the North Temperate\r\nregions, and has its least development in the Australian region. Thrushes\r\nare among the most perfectly organized of birds, and it is to this cause,\r\nperhaps, as well as to their omnivorous diet, that they have been enabled\r\nto establish themselves on a number of remote islands. Peculiar species of\r\ntrue thrush are found in Norfolk Island, and in the small Lord Howes'\r\nIsland nearer Australia; the Island of St. Thomas in the Gulf of Guinea has\r\na peculiar species; while the Mid-Atlantic island Tristan d'Acunha,--one of\r\nthe most remote and isolated spots on the globe,--has a peculiarly modified\r\nform of thrush. Several of the smaller West Indian Islands have also\r\npeculiar species or genera of thrushes.\r\n\r\nThe family is of somewhat uncertain extent, blending insensibly with the\r\nwarblers (Sylviidæ) as well as with the Indian bulbuls {256}(Pycnonotidæ),\r\nwhile one genus, usually placed in it (_Myiophonus_) seems to agree better\r\nwith _Enicurus_ among the Cinclidæ.

As the genera are all enumerated in the\r\ntable, at p. 101 of this volume, I shall here confine myself to the\r\ndistribution of the sub-families, only referring to such genera as are of\r\nspecial geographical interest.\r\n\r\nSub-family I. CONOPHAGINÆ (2 genera, 13 species). Confined to tropical\r\nSouth America, from Brazil and Bolivia to Guiana and Columbia.\r\n\r\nSub-family II. TÆNIOPTERINÆ (19 genera, 76 species). This group ranges from\r\nPatagonia and the Falkland Islands to the northern United States; yet it is\r\nalmost wholly South American, only 2 genera and 4 species passing north of\r\nPanama, and none inhabiting the West Indian islands. _Empidias_ has 3\r\nspecies in North America, while _Tænioptera_, _Cnipolegus_,\r\n_Muscisaxicola_, and _Centrites_, range south to Patagonia.\r\n\r\nSub-family III. PLATYRHYNICHINÆ (16 genera, 60 species). This sub-family is\r\nwholly Neotropical and mostly South American, only 7 of the genera passing\r\nPanama and but 3 reaching Mexico, while there are none in the West Indian\r\nislands. Only 3 genera extend south to the temperate sub-region, and one of\r\nthese, _Anæretes_, has a species in Juan Fernandez.\r\n\r\nSub-family IV. ELAINEINÆ (17 genera, 91 species). This sub-family is more\r\nexclusively tropical, only two genera extending south as far as Chili and\r\nLa Plata, while none enter the Nearctic region. No less than 10 of the\r\ngenera pass north of Panama, and one of these, _Elainea_, which ranges from\r\nChili to Costa Rica has several species in the West Indian islands. About\r\none fourth of the species of this sub-family are found north of Panama.\r\n\r\nSub-family V. TYRANNINÆ (17 genera, 89 species). This sub-family is that\r\nwhich is best represented in the Nearctic region, where 6 genera and 24\r\nspecies occur. _Milvulus_ reaches Texas; _Tyrannus_ and _Myiarchus_ range\r\nover all the United States; _Sayornis_, the Eastern States and California;\r\n_Contopus_ extends to Canada; _Empidonax_ ranges all over North America;\r\nand _Pyrocephalus_ reaches the Gila Valley as well as the Galapagos\r\nIslands.

This sub-family is\r\nrestricted to the Amazonian region and Guiana, with one species extending\r\nalong the Andean valleys to Bolivia. The genera are _Rupicola_ (3 species)\r\nand _Phænicocercus_ (2 species).\r\n\r\nSub-family V. COTINGINÆ (10 genera, 28 species). Ranges from Southern\r\nBrazil and Bolivia to Nicaragua; only two species {294}(belonging to the\r\ngenera _Carpodectes_ and _Cotinga_) are found north of Panama, and there\r\nare none in the West Indian islands.

Only two species are\r\nknown, inhabiting East and West Australia respectively. They are very\r\nnoisy, brown-coloured birds, and have been usually classed with the\r\nwarblers, near _Amytis_ and other Australian species.\r\n\r\n\r\n_General remarks on the distribution of the Passeres._\r\n\r\nThe order Passeres, is the most extensive among birds, comprehending about\r\n5,700 species grouped in 870 genera, and 51 families. The distribution of\r\nthe genera, and of the families considered individually, has been already\r\nsufficiently given, and we now have to consider the peculiarities of\r\ndistribution of the families collectively, and in their relations to each\r\nother, as representing well-marked types of bird-structure. The first thing\r\nto be noted is, how very few of these families are truly cosmopolitan; for\r\nalthough there are seven which are found in each of the great regions, yet\r\nfew of these are widely distributed throughout all the regions, and we can\r\nonly find three that inhabit every sub-region, and are distributed with\r\ntolerable uniformity; these are the Hirundinidæ, or swallows, the\r\nMotacillidæ or wagtails and pipits, and the Corvidæ or crows,--but the\r\nlatter is a family of so heterogeneous a nature, that it possibly contains\r\nthe materials of several natural families, and if so divided, the parts\r\nwould probably all cease to be cosmopolitan. The Sylviidæ, the\r\n{300}Turdidæ, and the Paridæ, are the only other families that approach\r\nuniversality of distribution, and all these are wanting in one or more\r\nsub-regions. If, now, we divide the globe into the New and the Old World,\r\nthe former including the whole American continent, the latter all the rest\r\nof the earth, we find that the Old World possesses exclusively 23 families,\r\nthe New World exclusively 14, of which 5 are common to North and South\r\nAmerica. But if we take the division proposed by Professor Huxley--a\r\nnorthern world, comprising our first four regions (from Nearctic to\r\nOriental), and a southern world comprising our last two regions (the\r\nAustralian and Neotropical)--we find that the northern division possesses\r\nonly 5 families exclusively, and the southern division 13 exclusively, of\r\nwhich not one is common to Australia and South America. This plainly\r\nindicates that, as far as the Passeres are concerned, the latter bipartite\r\ndivision is not so natural as the former. Again, if we compare temperate\r\nwith tropical families (not too rigidly, but as regards their general\r\ncharacter), we find in the northern hemisphere only two families that have\r\nthe character of being typically temperate--the Cinclidæ, and in a less\r\ndegree the Ampelidæ--both of small extent. In the southern hemisphere we\r\nhave also two, the Phytotomidæ, and in a less degree, the Pteroptochidæ;\r\nmaking two wholly and two mainly temperate families. Of exclusively\r\ntropical families on the other hand, we have about 12, and several others\r\nthat are mainly tropical.\r\n\r\nThe several regions do not differ greatly in the number of families found\r\nin each. The Nearctic has 19, the Palæarctic 21, the Ethiopian 23, the\r\nOriental 28, the Australian 29, and the Neotropical 23. But many of these\r\nfamilies are only represented by a few species, or in limited districts;\r\nand if we count only those families which are tolerably well represented,\r\nand help to form the ornithological character of the region, the richness\r\nof the several tropical regions will appear to be (as it really is)\r\ncomparatively much greater. The families that are confined to single\r\nregions are not very numerous, except in the case of the Neotropical\r\nregion, which has 5. The Australian has only {301}3, the Oriental 1, the\r\nEthiopian 1, and the other regions have no peculiar families.\r\n\r\nThe distribution of the Passeres may be advantageously considered as\r\ndivided into the five series of Turdoid, Tanagroid, Sturnoid, Formicarioid,\r\nand Anomalous Passeres. The Turdoid Passeres, consisting of the first 23\r\nfamilies, are especially characteristic of the Old World, none being found\r\nexclusively in America, and only two or three being at all abundant there.\r\nThe Tanagroid Passeres (Families 24-33) are very characteristic of the New\r\nWorld, five being confined to it, and three others being quite as abundant\r\nthere as in the Old World; while there is not a single exclusively Old\r\nWorld family in the series, except the Drepanididæ confined to the Sandwich\r\nIslands. The Sturnoid Passeres (Families 34-38) are all exclusively Old\r\nWorld, except that two larks inhabit parts of North America, and a few\r\npipits South America. The Formicarioid Passeres (Families 39-48) are\r\nstrikingly characteristic of the New World, to which seven of the families\r\nexclusively belong; the two Old World groups being small, and with a very\r\nrestricted distribution. The Anomalous Passeres (Families 49-50) are\r\nconfined to Australia.\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable feature in the geographical distribution of the\r\nPasseres is the richness of the American continent, and the large\r\ndevelopment of characteristic types that occurs there. The fact that\r\nAmerica possesses 14 altogether peculiar families, while no less than 23\r\nOld-World families are entirely absent from it, plainly indicates, that, if\r\nthis division does not represent the most ancient and radical separation of\r\nthe land surface of the globe, it must still be one of very great\r\nantiquity, and have modified in a very marked way the distribution of all\r\nliving things. Not less remarkable is the richness in specific forms of the\r\n13 peculiar American families. These contain no less than 1,570 species,\r\nleaving only about 500 American species in the 13 other Passerine families\r\nrepresented in the New World. If we make a deduction for those Nearctic\r\nspecies which occur only north of Panama, we may estimate the truly\r\nNeotropical species of Passerine birds at 1,900, which is almost exactly\r\n{302}_one-third_ of the total number of Passeres; a wonderful illustration\r\nof the Ornithological riches of South America.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Order II.--PICARIÆ._\r\n\r\nFAMILY 51.--PICIDÆ.

They are most abundant in the\r\nNeotropical and Oriental regions, both of which possess a number of\r\npeculiar genera; while the other regions possess few or no peculiar forms,\r\neven the Ethiopian region having only three genera not found elsewhere. The\r\nsoft-tailed Picumninæ inhabit the tropical regions only, _Picumnus_ being\r\nNeotropical, _Vivia_ and _Sasia_ Oriental, and _Verreauxia_ Ethiopian.\r\n_Picoides_, or _Apternus_, is an Arctic form peculiar to the Nearctic and\r\nPalæarctic regions. _Celeus_, _Chrysoptilus_, _Chloronerpes_, and some\r\nsmaller genera, are Neotropical exclusively, and there are two peculiar\r\nforms in Cuba. _Yungipicus_, _Chrysocolaptes_, _Hemicercus_,\r\n_Mulleripicus_, _Brachypternus_, _Tiga_, and _Micropternus_, are the most\r\nimportant of the peculiar Oriental genera. _Dendropicus_ and _Geocolaptes_\r\nare Ethiopian; but there are no woodpeckers in Madagascar. The Palæarctic\r\nwoodpeckers belong to the genera _Picus_--which is widely distributed,\r\n_Gecinus_--which is an Oriental form, and _Dryocopus_--which is South\r\nAmerican. Except _Picoides_, the Nearctic woodpeckers are mostly of\r\nNeotropical genera; but _Sphyrapicus_ and _Hylatomus_ are peculiar. The\r\ngeological record is, as yet, almost silent as to this family; but remains\r\ndoubtfully referred to it have been found in the Miocene of Europe and the\r\nEocene of the United States. Yet the group is evidently one of very high\r\nantiquity, as is shown by {303}its extreme isolation, its great\r\nspecialization of structure, its abundant generic forms, and its wide\r\ndistribution. It originated, probably, in Central Asia, and passed through,\r\nthe Nearctic region to South America, in whose rich and varied forests it\r\nfound the conditions for rapid development, and for the specialization of\r\nthe many generic forms now found there.\r\n\r\nA large number of genera have been established by various authors, but\r\ntheir limitations and affinities are not very well made out.

They form a very isolated family; their nearest\r\nallies being, perhaps, the still more isolated Toucans of South America.\r\nBarbets are found in all the tropics except Australia, but are especially\r\ncharacteristic of the great Equatorial forest-zone; all the most remarkable\r\nforms being confined to Equatorial America, West Africa, and the Indo-Malay\r\nIslands. They are most abundant in the Ethiopian and Oriental regions, and\r\nin the latter are universally distributed.\r\n\r\nIn the beautiful monograph of this family by the Messrs. Marshall, the\r\nbarbets are divided into three sub-families, as follows:--\r\n\r\nPogonorhynchinæ (3 genera, 15 sp.), which are Ethiopian except the 2\r\nspecies of _Tetragonops_, which are Neotropical; Megalæminæ (6 genera, 45\r\nsp.), which are Oriental and Ethiopian; and Capitoninæ (4 genera, 18 sp.),\r\ncommon to the three regions.\r\n\r\nThe genera are each confined to a single region. Africa possesses the\r\nlargest number of peculiar forms, while the Oriental region is richest in\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nThis is probably a very ancient group, and its existing distribution may be\r\ndue to its former range over the Miocene South Palæarctic land, which we\r\nknow possessed Trogons, Parrots, Apes, and Tapirs, groups which are now\r\nequally abundant in Equatorial countries.\r\n\r\n{306}The following is a tabular view of the genera with their\r\ndistribution:--\r\n\r\n  --------------------+------------------+----------------+----------------\r\n        Genera        |    Ethiopian     |    Oriental    |   Neotropical\r\n                      |     Region.      |     Region.    |     Region.\r\n  --------------------+------------------+----------------+----------------\r\n                      |                  |                |\r\n  POGONORHYNCHINÆ.    |                  |                |\r\n  Tricholæma     1 sp.|W.

Many of the smaller Eastern species are adorned with the most\r\nintense golden or violet metallic lustre, while some of the larger forms\r\nhave gaily-coloured bills or bare patches of bright red on the cheeks. Many\r\nof the cuckoos of the Eastern Hemisphere are parasitic, laying their eggs\r\nin other birds' nests; and they are also remarkable for the manner in which\r\nthey resemble other birds, as hawks, pheasants, or drongo-shrikes. The\r\ndistribution of the Cuckoo family is rather remarkable. They abound most in\r\nthe Oriental region, which produces no less than 18 genera, of which 11 are\r\npeculiar; the Australian has 8, most of which are also Oriental, but 3 are\r\npeculiar, one of these being confined to Celebes and closely allied to an\r\nOriental group; the Ethiopian region has only 7 genera, all of which are\r\nOriental but three, 2 of these being peculiar to Madagascar, and the other\r\ncommon to Madagascar and Africa. America has 11 genera, all quite distinct\r\nfrom those of the Eastern Hemisphere, and only three enter the Nearctic\r\nregion, one species extending to Canada.\r\n\r\nRemembering our conclusions as to the early history of the several regions,\r\nthese facts enable us to indicate, with considerable probability, the\r\norigin and mode of dispersal of the cuckoos. They were almost certainly\r\ndeveloped in the Oriental and Palæarctic regions, but reached the\r\nNeotropical at a very early date, where they have since been completely\r\nisolated. Africa must have long remained without cuckoos, the earliest\r\nimmigration {309}being to Madagascar at the time of the approximation of\r\nthat sub-region to Ceylon and Malaya. A later infusion of Oriental forms\r\ntook place probably by way of Arabia and Persia, when those countries were\r\nmore fertile and perhaps more extensive. Australia has also received its\r\ncuckoos at a somewhat late date, a few having reached the Austro-Malay\r\nIslands somewhat earlier.\r\n\r\nThe classification of the family is somewhat unsettled. For the American\r\ngenera I follow Messrs. Sclater and Salvin; and, for those of the Old\r\nWorld, Mr. Sharpe's suggestive paper in the _Proceedings of the Zoological\r\nSociety_, 1873, p. 600.

In one Guatemalan species the tail coverts are\r\nenormously lengthened into waving plumes of rich metallic green, as\r\ngraceful and marvellous as those of the Paradise-birds. Trogons are\r\ntolerably abundant in the Neotropical and Oriental regions, and are\r\nrepresented in Africa by a single species of a peculiar genus. The genera\r\nnow generally admitted are the following:--\r\n\r\n_Trogon_ (24 sp.), Paraguay to Mexico, and west of the Andes in Ecuador;\r\n_Temnotrogon_ (1 sp.), Hayti; _Prionoteles_ (1 sp.), Cuba (Plate XVII.

At\r\nthat exceptionally mild period in the northern hemisphere, these birds may\r\nhave ranged over all Europe and North America; but, as the climate became\r\nmore severe they gradually became restricted to the tropical regions, where\r\nalone a sufficiency of fruit and insect-food is found all the year round.\r\n\r\n\r\n{315}FAMILY 67.--ALCEDINIDÆ.

They have their metropolis in the eastern half of the\r\nMalay Archipelago (our first Australian sub-region), from Celebes to New\r\nGuinea, in which district no less than 13 out of the 19 genera occur, 8 of\r\nthem being peculiar; and it is probable that in no other equally varied\r\ngroup of universal distribution, is so large a proportion of the generic\r\nforms confined to so limited a district. From this centre kingfishers\r\ndecrease rapidly in every direction. In Australia itself there are only 4\r\ngenera with 13 species; the whole Oriental region has only 6 genera, 1\r\nbeing peculiar; the Ethiopian also 6 genera, but 3 peculiar; and each of\r\nthese have less than half the number of species possessed by the Australian\r\nregion. The Palæarctic region possesses only 3 genera, all derived from the\r\nOriental region; but the most extraordinary deficiency is shown by the\r\nusually rich Neotropical region, which possesses but a single genus, common\r\nto the larger part of the Eastern Hemisphere, and the same genus is alone\r\nfound in the Nearctic region, the only difference being that the former\r\npossesses eight, while the latter has but a single species. These facts\r\nalmost inevitably lead to the conclusion that America long existed without\r\nkingfishers; and that in comparatively recent times (perhaps during the\r\nMiocene or Pliocene period), a species of the Old World genus, _Ceryle_,\r\nfound its way into North America, and spreading rapidly southward along the\r\ngreat river-valleys has become differentiated in South America into the few\r\nclosely allied forms that alone inhabit that vast country--the richest in\r\nthe world in {316}fresh-water fish, and apparently the best fitted to\r\nsustain a varied and numerous body of kingfishers.\r\n\r\nThe names of the genera, with their distribution and the number of species\r\nin each, as given by Mr. Sharpe in his excellent monograph of the family,\r\nis as follows:--\r\n\r\n_Alcedo_ (9 sp.), Palæarctic, Ethiopian, and Oriental regions (but absent\r\nfrom Madagascar), and extending into the Austro-Malayan sub-region;\r\n_Corythornis_ (3 sp.), the whole Ethiopian region; _Alcyone_ (7 sp.),\r\nAustralia and the Austro-Malayan sub-region, with one species in the\r\nPhilippine Islands; _Ceryle_ (13 sp.), absent only from Australia, the\r\nnorthern half of the Palæarctic region, and Madagascar; _Pelargopsis_ (9\r\nsp.), the whole Oriental region; and extending to Celebes and Timor in the\r\nAustro-Malayan sub-region; _Ceyx_ (11 sp.), the Oriental region and\r\nAustro-Malayan sub-region, but absent from Celebes, and only one species in\r\ncontinental India and Ceylon; _Ceycopsis_ (1 sp.), Celebes; _Myioceyx_ (2\r\nsp.), West Africa; _Ipsidina_ (4 sp.), Ethiopian region; _Syma_ (2 sp.),\r\nPapua and North Australia; _Halcyon_ (36 sp.), Australian, Oriental, and\r\nEthiopian regions, and the southern part of the Palæarctic; _Dacelo_ (6\r\nsp.), Australia and New Guinea; _Todirhamphus_ (3 sp.), Eastern Pacific\r\nIslands only; _Monachalcyon_ (1 sp.), Celebes; _Caridonax_ (1 sp.), Lombok\r\nand Flores; _Carcineutes_ (2 sp.), Siam to Borneo and Java; _Tanysiptera_\r\n(14 sp.), Moluccas New Guinea, and North Australia (Plate X.

Only 6 species,\r\nbelonging to 3 genera, are found in the Nearctic region, and most of these\r\nhave extended their range from the south. They are excessively abundant in\r\nthe forest-clad Andes from Mexico to Chili, some species extending up to\r\nthe limits of perpetual snow; but they diminish in number and variety in\r\nthe plains, however luxuriant the vegetation. In place of giving here the\r\nnames and distribution of the numerous genera into which they are now\r\ndivided (which will be found in the tables of the genera of the Neotropical\r\nregion), it may be more useful to present a summary of their distribution\r\nin the sub-divisions of the American continent, as follows:--\r\n\r\n  Sub-region I.   = Patagonia & S.

The island of Tres\r\nMarias, about 60 miles from the west coast of Mexico, possesses a peculiar\r\nspecies of humming-bird, and the Bahamas two species; but none inhabit\r\neither the Falkland Islands or the Galapagos.\r\n\r\nLike most groups which are very rich in species and in generic forms, the\r\nhumming-birds are generally very local, small {322}generic groups being\r\nconfined to limited districts; while single mountains, valleys, or small\r\nislands, often possess species found nowhere else. It is now well\r\nascertained that the Trochilidæ are really insectivorous birds, although\r\nthey also feed largely, but probably never exclusively, on the nectar of\r\nflowers. Their nearest allies are undoubtedly the Swifts; but the wide gap\r\nthat now separates them from these, as well as the wonderful variety of\r\nform and of development of plumage, that is found among them, alike point\r\nto their origin, at a very remote period, in the forests of the once\r\ninsular Andes. There is perhaps no more striking contrast of the like\r\nnature, to be found, than that between the American kingfishers--confined\r\nto a few closely allied forms of one Old World genus--and the American\r\nhumming-birds with more than a hundred diversified generic forms unlike\r\neverything else upon the globe; and we can hardly imagine any other cause\r\nfor this difference, than a (comparatively) very recent introduction in the\r\none case, and a very high antiquity in the other.\r\n\r\n\r\n_General Remarks on the Distribution of the Picariæ._\r\n\r\nThe very heterogeneous mass of birds forming the Order Picariæ, contains 25\r\nfamilies, 307 genera and 1,604 species. This gives about 64 species to each\r\nfamily, while in the Passeres the proportion is nearly double, or 111\r\nspecies per family. There are, in fact, only two very large families in the\r\nOrder, which happen to be the first and last in the series--Picidæ and\r\nTrochilidæ. Two others--Cuculidæ and Alcedinidæ--are rather large; while\r\nthe rest are all small, seven of them consisting only of a single genus and\r\nfrom one to a dozen species. Only one of the families--Alcedinidæ--is\r\nabsolutely cosmopolitan, but three others are nearly so, Caprimulgidæ and\r\nCypselidæ being only absent from New Zealand, and Cuculidæ from the\r\nCanadian sub-region of North America. Eleven families inhabit the Old World\r\nonly, while seven are confined to the New World, only one of\r\nthese--Trochilidæ--being common to the Neotropical and Nearctic regions.\r\n\r\nThe Picariæ are highly characteristic of tropical faunas, for {323}while no\r\nless than 15 out of the 25 families are exclusively tropical, none are\r\nconfined to, or have their chief development in, the temperate regions.\r\nThey are best represented in the Ethiopian region, which possesses 17\r\nfamilies, 4 of which are peculiar to it; while the Oriental region has only\r\n14 families, none of which are peculiar. The Neotropical region has also 14\r\nfamilies, but 6 of them are peculiar. The Australian region has 8, the\r\nPalæarctic 9 and the Nearctic 6 families, but none of these are peculiar.\r\nWe may see a reason for the great specialization of this tropical\r\nassemblage of birds in the Ethiopian and Neotropical regions, in the fact\r\nof the large extent of land on both sides of the Equator which these two\r\nregions alone possess, and their extreme isolation either by sea or deserts\r\nfrom other regions,--an isolation which we know was in both cases much\r\ngreater in early Tertiary times. It is, perhaps, for a similar reason that\r\nwe here find hardly any trace of the connection between Australia and South\r\nAmerica which other groups exhibit; for that connection has most probably\r\nbeen effected by a former communication between the temperate southern\r\nextremities of those two continents. The most interesting and suggestive\r\nfact, is that presented by the distribution of the Megalæmidæ and Trogonidæ\r\nover the tropics of America, Africa, and Asia. In the absence of\r\npalæontological evidence as to the former history of the Megalæmidæ, we are\r\nunable to say positively, whether it owes its present distribution to a\r\nformer closer union between these continents in intertropical latitudes, or\r\nto a much greater northern range of the group at the period when a\r\nluxuriant sub-tropical vegetation extended far toward the Arctic regions;\r\nbut the discovery of _Trogon_ in the Miocene deposits of the South of\r\nFrance renders it almost certain that the latter is the true explanation in\r\nthe case of both these families.\r\n\r\nThe Neotropical region, owing to its enormous family of humming-birds, is\r\nby far the richest in Picariæ, possessing nearly half the total number of\r\nspecies, and a still larger proportion of genera. Three families, the\r\nBucerotidæ, Meropidæ and Coraciidæ are equally characteristic of the\r\nOriental and {324}Ethiopian regions, a few outlying species only entering\r\nthe Australian or the Palæarctic regions. One family (Todidæ) is confined\r\nto the West Indian Islands; and another (Leptosomidæ) consisting of but a\r\nsingle species, to Madagascar; parallel cases to the Drepanididæ among the\r\nPasseres, peculiar to the Sandwich Islands, and the Apterygidæ among the\r\nStruthiones, peculiar to New Zealand.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Order III.--PSITTACI._\r\n\r\nThe Parrots have been the subject of much difference of opinion among\r\nornithologists, and no satisfactory arrangement of the order into families\r\nand genera has yet been reached. Professor Garrod has lately examined\r\ncertain points in the anatomy of a large number of genera, and proposes to\r\nrevolutionize the ordinary classifications. Until, however, a general\r\nexamination of their whole anatomy, internal and external, has been made by\r\nsome competent authority, it will be unsafe to adopt the new system, as we\r\nhave as yet no guide to the comparative value of the characters made use\r\nof. I therefore keep as much as possible to the old groups, founded on\r\nexternal characters, only using the indications furnished by Professor\r\nGarrod's paper, to determine the position of doubtful genera.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY 76.--CACATUIDÆ.

Vol. I. p. 455). An allied\r\nspecies is said to inhabit the Chatham Islands, if not now extinct.\r\n\r\n\r\n_General Remarks on the Distribution of the Psittaci._\r\n\r\nAlthough the Parrots are now generally divided into several distinct\r\nfamilies, yet they form so well marked and natural a group, and are so\r\nwidely separated from all other birds, that we may best discuss their\r\npeculiarities of geographical distribution by treating them as a whole. By\r\nthe preceding enumeration we find that there are about 386 species of known\r\nparrots, which are divided into 52 genera. They are pre-eminently a\r\ntropical group, for although a few species extend a considerable distance\r\ninto the temperate zone, these are {330}marked exceptions to the rule which\r\nlimits the parrot tribe to the tropical and sub-tropical regions, roughly\r\ndefined as extending about 30° on each side of the equator. In America a\r\nspecies of _Conurus_ reaches the straits of Magellan on the south, while\r\nanother inhabits the United States, and once extended to the great lakes,\r\nalthough now confined to the south-eastern districts. In Africa parrots do\r\nnot reach the northern tropic, owing to the desert nature of the country;\r\nand in the south they barely reach the Orange River. In India they extend\r\nto about 35° N. in the western Himalayas; and in the Australian region, not\r\nonly to New Zealand but to Macquarie Islands in 54° S., the farthest point\r\nfrom the equator reached by the group. But although found in all the\r\ntropical regions they are most unequally distributed. Africa is poorest,\r\npossessing only 6 genera and 25 species; the Oriental region is also very\r\npoor, having but 6 genera and 29 species; the Neotropical region is much\r\nricher, having 14 genera and 141 species; while the smallest in area and\r\nthe least tropical in climate--the Australian region, possesses 31 genera\r\nand 176 species, and it also possesses exclusively 5 of the families,\r\nTrichoglossidæ, Platycercidæ, Cacatuidæ, Nestoridæ, and Stringopidæ. The\r\nportion of the earth's surface that contains the largest number of parrots\r\nin proportion to its area is, undoubtedly, the Austro-Malayan sub-region,\r\nincluding the islands from Celebes to the Solomon Islands. The area of\r\nthese islands is probably not one-fifteenth of that of the four tropical\r\nregions, yet they contain from one-fifth to one-fourth of all the known\r\nparrots. In this area too are found many of the most remarkable forms,--all\r\nthe crimson lories, the great black Cockatoos, the pigmy _Nasiterna_, the\r\nraquet-tailed _Prioniturus_, and the bareheaded _Dasyptilus_.\r\n\r\nThe almost universal distribution of Parrots wherever the climate is\r\nsufficiently mild or uniform to furnish them with a perennial supply of\r\nfood, no less than their varied details of organization, combined with a\r\ngreat uniformity of general type,--tell us, in unmistakable language, of a\r\nvery remote antiquity. The only early record of extinct parrots is,\r\nhowever, in the Miocene of France, where remains apparently allied to the\r\nWest {331}African _Psittacus_, have been found. But the origin of so\r\nwidespread, isolated, and varied a group, must be far earlier than this,\r\nand not improbably dates back beyond the dawn of the Tertiary period. Some\r\nprimeval forms may have entered the Australian region with the Marsupials,\r\nor not long after them; while perhaps at a somewhat later epoch they were\r\nintroduced into South America. In these two regions they have greatly\r\nflourished, while in the two other tropical regions only a few types have\r\nbeen found, capable of maintaining themselves, among the higher forms of\r\nmammalia, and in competition with a more varied series of birds. This seems\r\nmuch more probable than the supposition that so highly organized a group\r\nshould have originated in the Australian region, and subsequently become so\r\nwidely spread over the globe.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Order IV.--COLUMBÆ._\r\n\r\nFAMILY 84.--COLUMBIDÆ.

Being best adapted to live in\r\nwarm or temperate climates, they diminish rapidly northwards, reaching\r\nabout 62° N. Latitude in North America, but considerably farther in Europe.\r\nBoth the Nearctic and Palæarctic regions are very poor in genera and\r\nspecies of pigeons, those of the former region being mostly allied to\r\nNeotropical, and those of the latter to Oriental and Ethiopian types. The\r\nEthiopian region is, however, itself very poor, and several of its peculiar\r\nforms are confined to the Madagascar sub-region. The Neotropical region is\r\nvery rich in peculiar genera, though but moderately so in number of\r\nspecies.

The Dodo\r\n(_Didus ineptus_) a large, unwieldy, flightless bird, inhabited Mauritius\r\ndown to the latter part of the 17th century; and an allied form, the\r\nSolitaire (_Pezophaps solitaria_), was found only in the island of\r\nRodriguez, where it survived about a century later. Old voyagers mention a\r\nDodo also in Bourbon, and a rude figure of it exists; but no remains of\r\nthis bird have been found. Almost complete skeletons of the Dodo and\r\nSolitaire have, however, been recovered from the swamps of Mauritius and\r\nthe caves of Rodriguez, proving that they were both extremely modified\r\nforms of pigeon. These large birds were formerly very abundant, and being\r\nexcellent eating and readily captured, the early voyagers to these islands\r\nused them largely for food. As they could be caught by man, and very easily\r\nby dogs, they were soon greatly diminished in numbers; and the introduction\r\nof swine, which ran wild in the forests and fed on the eggs and young\r\nbirds, completed their extermination.\r\n\r\nThe existence in the Mascarene Islands of a group of such remarkable\r\nterrestrial birds, with aborted wings, is parallel to that of the _Apteryx_\r\nand _Dinornis_ in New Zealand, the Cassowaries of Austro-Malaya, and the\r\nshort-winged Rails of New {335}Zealand, Tristan d'Acunha, and other oceanic\r\nislands; and the phenomenon is clearly dependent on the long-continued\r\nabsence of enemies, which allowed of great increase of bulk and the total\r\nloss of the power of flight, without injury. In some few cases (the Ostrich\r\nfor example) birds incapable of flight co-exist with large carnivorous\r\nmammalia; but these birds are large and powerful, as well as very swift,\r\nand are thus able to escape from some enemies and defend themselves against\r\nothers. The entire absence of the smaller and more defenceless ground-birds\r\nfrom the adjacent island of Madagascar, is quite in accordance with this\r\nview, because that island has several small but destructive carnivorous\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\n\r\n_General Remarks on the Distribution of the Columbæ._\r\n\r\nThe striking preponderance of Pigeons, both as to genera and species, in\r\nthe Australian region, would seem to indicate that at some former period it\r\npossessed a more extensive land area in which this form of bird-life took\r\nits rise. But there are other considerations which throw doubt upon this\r\nview. The western half of the Malay Archipelago, belonging to the Oriental\r\nregion, is also rich in pigeons, since it has 43 species belonging to 11\r\ngenera, rather more than are found in all the rest of the Oriental region.\r\nAgain, we find that the Mascarene Islands and the Antilles both possess\r\nmore pigeons than we should expect, in proportion to those of the regions\r\nto which they belong, and to their total amount of bird-life. This looks as\r\nif islands were more favourable to pigeon-development than continents; and\r\nif we group together the Pacific and the Malayan Islands, the Mascarene\r\ngroup and the Antilles, we find that they contain together about 170\r\nspecies of pigeons belonging to 24 out of the 47 genera here adopted; while\r\nall the great continents united only produce about the same number of\r\nspecies belonging (if we omit those peculiar to Australia) to only 20\r\ngenera. The great development of the group in the Australian region may,\r\ntherefore, be due to its consisting mainly of islands, and not to the order\r\nhaving originated there, and thus having had a longer period in which to\r\ndevelop. I have elsewhere suggested (_Ibis_ 1865, p. 366) {336}a physical\r\ncause for this peculiarity of distribution. Pigeons build rude, open nests,\r\nand their young remain helpless for a considerable period. They are thus\r\nexposed to the attacks of such arboreal quadrupeds or other animals as feed\r\non eggs or young birds. Monkeys are very destructive in this respect; and\r\nit is a noteworthy fact that over the whole Australian region, the\r\nMascarene Islands and the Antilles, monkeys are unknown. In the Indo-Malay\r\nsub-region, where monkeys are generally plentiful, the greatest variety of\r\npigeons occurs in the Philippines, where there is but a single species in\r\none island; and in Java, where monkeys are far less numerous than in\r\nSumatra or Borneo. If we add to this consideration the fact, that mammalia\r\nand rapacious birds are, as a rule, far less abundant in islands than on\r\ncontinents; and that the extreme development of pigeon-life is reached in\r\nthe Papuan group of islands, in which mammalia (except a few marsupials,\r\nbats, and pigs) are wholly absent, we see further reason to adopt this\r\nview. It is also to be noted that in America, comparatively few pigeons are\r\nfound in the rich forests (comparable to those of the Australian insular\r\nregion in which they abound), but are mostly confined to the open campos,\r\nthe high Andes, and the western coast districts, from which the\r\nmonkey-tribe are wholly absent.\r\n\r\nThis view is further supported by the great development of colour that is\r\nfound in the pigeons of these insular regions, culminating in the\r\ngolden-yellow fruit-dove of the Fiji Islands, the metallic green\r\nNicobar-pigeon of Malaya, and the black and crimson _Alectroenas_ of\r\nMauritius. Here also, alone, we meet with crested pigeons, rendering the\r\npossessors more conspicuous; such as the _Lopholaimus_ of Australia and the\r\ncrowned _Goura_ of New Guinea; and here too are more peculiar forms of\r\nterrestrial pigeons than elsewhere, though none have completely lost the\r\npower of flight but the now extinct Dididæ.\r\n\r\nThe curious liking of pigeons for an insular habitat is well shown in the\r\ngenera _Ianthoenas_ and _Caloenas_. The former, containing 11 species,\r\nranges over a hundred degrees of longitude, and forty-five of latitude,\r\nextending into three regions, yet nowhere inhabits a continent or even a\r\nlarge island. It is {337}found in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands; in the\r\nPhilippines, Gilolo, and the smaller Papuan Islands, and in Japan; yet not\r\nin any of the large Malay Islands or in Australia. The other genus,\r\n_Caloenas_, consists of but a single species, yet this ranges from the\r\nNicobar Islands to New Guinea. It is not, however, as far as known, found\r\non any of the large islands, but seems to prefer the smaller islands which\r\nsurround them. We here have the general preference of pigeons for islands,\r\nfurther developed in these two genera into a preference for small islands;\r\nand it is probable that the same cause--the greater freedom from\r\ndanger--has produced both phenomena.\r\n\r\nOf the geological antiquity of the Columbæ we have no evidence; but their\r\nwide distribution, their varied forms, and their great isolation, all point\r\nto an origin, at least as far back as that we have assigned as probable in\r\nthe case of the Parrots.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Order V.--GALLINÆ._\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY 86.--PTEROCLIDÆ.

They are highly characteristic of the Australian region,\r\nextending into almost every part of it except New Zealand and the remotest\r\nPacific islands, and only sending two species beyond its limits,--a\r\n_Megapodius_ in the Philippine Islands and North-west Borneo, and another\r\nin the Nicobar Islands, separated by about 1,800 miles from its nearest\r\nally in Lombok. The Philippine species offers little difficulty, for these\r\nbirds are found on the smallest {342}islands and sand-banks, and can\r\nevidently pass over a few miles of sea with ease; but the Nicobar bird is a\r\nvery different case, because none of the numerous intervening islands offer\r\na single example of the family. Instead of being a well-marked and clearly\r\ndifferentiated form, as we should expect to find it if its remote and\r\nisolated habitat were due to natural causes, it so nearly resembles some of\r\nthe closely-allied species of the Moluccas and New Guinea, that, had it\r\nbeen found with them, it would hardly have been thought specifically\r\nextinct. I therefore believe that it is probably an introduction by the\r\nMalays, and that, owing to the absence of enemies and general suitability\r\nof conditions, it has thriven in the islands and has become slightly\r\ndifferentiated in colour from the parent stock. The following is the\r\ndistribution of the genera at present known:--\r\n\r\n_Talegallus_ (2 sp.), New Guinea and East Australia; _Megacephalon_ (1\r\nsp.), East Celebes; _Lipoa_ (1 sp.), South Australia; _Megapodius_ (16\r\nsp.), Philippine Islands and Celebes, to Timor, North Australia, New\r\nCaledonia, the Marian and Samoa Islands, and probably every intervening\r\nisland,--also a species (doubtfully indigenous) in the Nicobar Islands.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY 91.--CRACIDÆ, (12 Genera, 53 Species.)\r\n\r\n                           GENERAL DISTRIBUTION.\r\n   __________________________________/\\__________________________________\r\n  /                                                                      \\\r\n  NEOTROPICAL| NEARCTIC  |PALÆARCTIC | ETHIOPIAN | ORIENTAL  | AUSTRALIAN\r\n  SUB-REGIONS|SUB-REGIONS|SUB-REGIONS|SUB-REGIONS|SUB-REGIONS|SUB-REGIONS.\r\n  -----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+------------\r\n             |           |           |           |           |\r\n  -- 2. 3 -- |-- 2 -- -- |-- -- -- --|-- -- -- --|-- -- -- --|-- -- -- --\r\n             |           |           |           |           |\r\n\r\n(Messrs. Sclater and Salvin's arrangement is here followed).\r\n\r\nThe Cracidæ, or Curassows and Guans, comprise the largest and handsomest\r\ngame-birds of the Neotropical region, where they take the place of the\r\ngrouse and pheasants of the Old World. They are almost all forest-dwellers,\r\nand are a strictly Neotropical family, only one species just entering the\r\nNearctic region as far as New Mexico. They extend southward to Paraguay and\r\nthe extreme south of Brazil, but none are found in the {343}Antilles, nor\r\nwest of the Andes south of the bay of Guayaquil. The sub-families and\r\ngenera are as follows:--\r\n\r\nCRACINÆ, 4 genera.--_Crax_ (8 sp.), Mexico to Paraguay (Plate XV., Vol. II.\r\np. 28); _Nothocrax_ (1 sp.), Guiana, Upper Rio Negro, and Upper Amazon;\r\n_Pauxi_ (1 sp.), Guiana to Venezuela; _Mitua_ (2 sp.), Guiana and Upper\r\nAmazon.\r\n\r\nPENELOPINÆ, 7 genera.--_Stegnolæma_ (1 sp.), Columbia and Ecuador;\r\n_Penelope_ (14 sp.), Mexico to Paraguay and to western slope of Ecuadorian\r\nAndes; _Penelopina_ (1 sp.), Guatemala; _Pipile_ (3 sp.), Venezuela to\r\nEastern Brazil; _Aburria_ (1 sp), Columbia; _Chamæpetes_ (2 sp.), Costa\r\nRica to Peru; _Ortalida_ (18 sp.), New Mexico to Paraguay, also Tobago.\r\n\r\nOREOPHASINÆ, 1 genus.--_Oreophasis_ (1 sp.), Guatemala.\r\n\r\nIt thus appears that the Cracinæ are confined to South America east of the\r\nAndes, except one species in Central America; whereas nine Penelopinæ and\r\n_Oreophasis_ are found north of Panama. The species of the larger genera\r\nare strictly representative, each having its own distinct geographical\r\narea, so that two species of the same genus are rarely or never found in\r\nthe same locality.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY 92.--TINAMIDÆ.

They differ greatly in their organization from any of\r\nthe Old World Gallinæ, and approach, in some respects, the Struthiones or\r\nOstrich tribe. They are very terrestrial in their habits, inhabiting the\r\nforests, open plains, and mountains of the Neotropical region, from\r\nPatagonia and Chili to Mexico; but, like the Cracidæ, they are absent from\r\nthe Antilles. Their colouring is very sober and protective, as is the case\r\nwith so many ground-birds, and they are seldom adorned {344}with crests or\r\nother ornamental plumes, so prevalent in the order to which they belong.\r\nThe sub-families and genera, according to the arrangement of Messrs.\r\nSclater and Salvin, are as follows:--\r\n\r\nTINAMINÆ, 7 genera.--_Tinamus_ (7 sp.), Mexico to Paraguay; _Nothocercus_\r\n(3 sp.), Costa Rica to Venezuela and Ecuador; _Crypturus_ (16 sp.), Mexico\r\nto Paraguay and Bolivia; _Rhynchotus_ (2 sp.), Bolivia and South Brazil to\r\nLa Plata; _Nothoprocta_ (4 sp.), Ecuador to Bolivia and Chili; _Nothura_ (4\r\nsp.), Brazil and Bolivia to Patagonia; _Taoniscus_ (1 sp.), Brazil to\r\nParaguay.\r\n\r\nTINAMOTINÆ, 2 genera.-- _Calodromas_ (1 sp.), La Plata and Patagonia;\r\n_Tinamotis_ (1 sp.), Andes of Peru and Bolivia.\r\n\r\n\r\n_General Remarks on the Distribution of Gallinæ._\r\n\r\nThere are about 400 known species of Gallinaceous birds grouped into 76\r\ngenera, of which no less than 65 are each restricted to a single region.\r\nThe Tetraonidæ are the only cosmopolitan family, and even these do not\r\nextend into Temperate South America, and are very poorly represented in\r\nAustralia. The Cracidæ and Tinamidæ are strictly Neotropical, the\r\nMegapodiidæ almost as strictly Australian. There remains the extensive\r\nfamily of the Phasianidæ, which offers some interesting facts. We have\r\nfirst the well-marked sub-families of the Numidinæ and Meleagrinæ, confined\r\nto the Ethiopian and Nearctic regions respectively, and we find the\r\nremaining five sub-families, comprising about 60 species, many of them the\r\nmost magnificent of known birds, spread over the Oriental and the\r\nsouth-eastern portion of the Palæarctic regions. This restriction is\r\nremarkable, since there is no apparent cause in climate or vegetation why\r\npheasants should not be found wild throughout southern Europe, as they were\r\nduring late Tertiary and Post-Tertiary times. We have also to notice the\r\nremarkable absence of the Pheasant tribe from Hindostan and Ceylon, where\r\nthe peacock and jungle-fowl are their sole representatives. These two forms\r\nalso alone extend to Java, whereas in the adjacent islands of Borneo and\r\nSumatra we have _Argusianus_, _Polyplectron_, and _Euplocamus_. The common\r\njungle-fowl (the origin of our domestic poultry) is the only {345}species\r\nwhich enters the Australian region as far as Celebes and Timor, and another\r\nspecies (_Gallus æneus_) as far as Flores, and it is not improbable that\r\nthese may have been introduced by man and become wild.\r\n\r\nWe have very little knowledge of the extinct forms of Gallinæ, but what we\r\nhave assures us of their high antiquity, since we find such distinct groups\r\nas the jungle-fowl, partridges, and _Pterocles_, represented in Europe in\r\nthe Miocene period; while the Turkey, then as now, appears to have been a\r\nspecial American type.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Order VI.--OPISTHOCOMI._\r\n\r\nFAMILY 93.--OPISTHOCOMIDÆ.

Those adopted by most ornithologists are\r\nthe following:--\r\n\r\n_Surnia_ (1 sp.), the Arctic regions of both hemispheres; _Nyctea_ (1 sp.),\r\nSouth Carolina to Greenland and Northern Europe; _Athene_ (40 sp.), the\r\nEastern hemisphere to New Zealand and the Solomon Islands; _Ninox_ (7 sp.),\r\nthe Oriental region, North China and Japan; _Glaucidium_ (7 sp.),\r\nNeotropical region, California, and Oregon, Europe to North China;\r\n_Micrathene_ (1 sp.), Mexico and Arizona; _Pholeoptynx_ (2 sp.),\r\nNeotropical region, Texas, and North-west America; _Bubo_ (16 sp.),\r\nuniversally distributed, excluding the Australian region; _Ketupa_ (3 sp.),\r\nthe Oriental region, Palestine; _Scotopelia_ (2 sp.), West and South\r\nAfrica; _Scops_ (30 sp.), universally distributed, excluding Australia and\r\nPacific Islands; _Gymnoglaux_ (2 sp.), Antilles; _Lophostrix_ (2 sp.),\r\nLower Amazon to Guatemala; _Syrnium_ (22 sp.), all regions but the\r\nAustralian; _Ciccaba_ (10 sp.), Paraguay to Mexico; _Nyctalatinus_ (1 sp.),\r\nColumbia; _Pulsatrix_ (2 sp.), Brazil and Peru to Guatemala; _Asio_ (6\r\nsp.), all regions but the Australian, Sandwich Islands; _Nyctalops_ (1\r\nsp.), Cuba and Mexico to Brazil and Monte Video; _Pseudoscops_ (1 sp.),\r\nJamaica; _Nyctala_ (4 sp.), the North Temperate zone; _Strix_ (18 sp.),\r\nuniversally distributed; _Phodilus_ (1 sp.), Himalayas and Malaya.\r\n\r\n{351}In Mr. Sharpe's Catalogue (published while this work was passing\r\nthrough the press) the genera of Owls are reduced to 19, arranged in two\r\nfamilies--Strigidæ, containing our last two genera, and Bubonidæ,\r\ncomprising the remainder. The species are increased to 190; but some genera\r\nare reduced, as _Strix_, which is said to contain only 5 species.\r\n\r\n\r\n_General Remarks on the Distribution of the Accipitres._\r\n\r\nThe Birds of Prey are so widely distributed over the world's surface that\r\ntheir general distribution calls for few remarks. Of the four families all\r\nbut one are cosmopolites, Vultures alone being absent from the Australian\r\nregion, as well as from Indo-Malaya and Madagascar. If we take the\r\nsub-families, we find that each region has several which are confined to\r\nit. The only parts of the world where there is a marked deficiency of\r\nAccipitres is in the islands of the Pacific; and it may be noted, as a\r\nrule, that these birds are more abundant in continents than in islands.\r\nThere is not so much difference between the number of Birds of Prey in\r\ntropical and temperate regions, as is found in most other groups of\r\nland-birds. North America and Europe have about 60 species each, while\r\nIndia has about 80, and South America about 120. The total number of\r\nAccipitres is 550 comprised in 104 genera, and 4 (or perhaps more properly\r\n5) families. In this estimate I have not included the Serpentariidæ,\r\ncontaining the Secretary Bird of Africa, as there is some doubt whether it\r\nreally belongs to the Order.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Order VIII.--GRALLÆ._\r\n\r\nFAMILY 99.--RALLIDÆ.

They are found in many remote islands; and in some of\r\nthese--as the _Gallinula_ of Tristan d'Acunha, and the _Notornis_ of Lord\r\nHowe's Island and New Zealand,--they have lost the power of flight. The\r\nclassification of the Rallidæ is not satisfactory, and the following\r\nenumeration of the genera must only be taken as affording a provisional\r\nsketch of the distribution of the group:--\r\n\r\n_Rallus_ (18 sp.), _Porzana_ (24 sp.), _Gallinula_ (17 sp.), and _Fulica_\r\n(10 sp.), have a world-wide range; _Ortygometra_ (1 sp.), ranges over the\r\nwhole North Temperate zone; _Porphyrio_ (14 sp.), is more especially\r\nOriental and Australian, but occurs also in South America, in Africa, and\r\nin South Europe; _Eulabeornis_ (15 sp.), is Ethiopian, Malayan, and\r\nAustralian; _Himantornis_ (1 sp.), is West African only; _Aramides_ (24\r\nsp.), is North and South American; _Rallina_ (16 sp.), is Oriental, but\r\nranges eastward to Papua; _Habroptila_ (1 sp.), is confined to the\r\nMoluccas; _Pareudiastes_ (1 sp.), the Samoa Islands; _Tribonyx_ (4 sp.), is\r\nAustralian, and has recently been found also in New Zealand; _Ocydromus_ (4\r\nsp.); _Notornis_ (2 sp.), (Plate XIII. Vol. I. p. 455); and _Cabalus_ (1\r\nsp.), are peculiar to the New Zealand group.\r\n\r\nThe sub-family, Heliornithinæ (sometimes classed as a distinct family)\r\nconsists of 2 genera, _Heliornis_ (1 sp.), confined to the Neotropical\r\nregion; and _Podica_ (4 sp.), the Ethiopian region excluding Madagascar,\r\nand with a species (perhaps forming another genus) in Borneo.\r\n\r\n_Extinct Rallidæ._--Remains of some species of this family have been found\r\nin the Mascarene Islands, and historical evidence shows that they have\r\nperhaps been extinct little more than a century. They belong to the genus\r\n_Fulica_, and to two extinct genera, _Aphanapteryx_ and _Erythromachus_.\r\nThe _Aphanapteryx_ was a large bird of a reddish colour, with loose\r\nplumage, and perhaps allied to _Ocydromus_. _Erythromachus_ was much\r\nsmaller, of a grey-and-white colour, and is said to have lived chiefly on\r\nthe eggs of the land-tortoises.

But there are also a number of\r\nsmall families of very restricted distribution, and these all occur in the\r\ntwo most isolated regions, the Neotropical and the Australian. The\r\nNeotropical region is by far the richest in varied forms of Waders, having\r\nrepresentatives of no less than 15 out of the 19 families, while 7 are\r\naltogether peculiar to it. The Australian region has 11 families, with 1\r\npeculiar. The other two tropical regions each possess 11 families, but none\r\nare peculiar. The Palæarctic region has 10, and the Nearctic 7 families. No\r\nless than three families--Chionididæ, Thinocoridæ, and Cariamidæ--are\r\nconfined to the Temperate regions and highlands of South America; while\r\nfour others,--Aramidæ, Psophiidæ, Eurypygidæ and Palamedeidæ,--are found in\r\nTropical America only; and these present such an array of peculiar and\r\ninteresting forms as no other part of the globe can furnish. The\r\nPhoenicopteridæ or Flamingoes, common to the Tropical regions of Asia,\r\nAfrica and America, but absent from Australia, is the only other feature of\r\ngeneral interest presented by the distribution of the Waders.\r\n\r\nThe Order contains about 610 species, which gives about 32 species to each\r\nfamily, a smaller average than in the Gallinæ or Accipitres, and only about\r\none-fourth of the average number in the Passeres. This is partly due to the\r\nunusual number of very small families, and partly to the wide average range\r\nof the species, which prevents that specialization of forms that occurs in\r\nthe more sedentary groups of birds.\r\n\r\n\r\n{363}_Order IX.--ANSERES._\r\n\r\nFAMILY 118.--ANATIDÆ.

The\r\nlast three genera constitute the family Uriidæ, of some ornithologists.\r\n\r\n\r\n_General Remarks on the Distribution of the Anseres._\r\n\r\nThe Anseres, or Swimmers, being truly aquatic birds, possess, as might be\r\nexpected, a large number of cosmopolitan families and genera. No less than\r\n5 out of the 8 families have a world-wide distribution, and the others are\r\ncharacteristic either of the North or the South Temperate zones. Hence\r\narises a peculiarity of distribution to be found in no other order of\r\nbirds; the Temperate being richer than the Tropical regions. The Nearctic\r\nand Palæarctic regions each have seven families of Anseres, two of which,\r\nthe Colymbidæ and Alcidæ, are peculiar to them. The Ethiopian, Australian,\r\nand Neotropical regions, which all {368}extend into the South Temperate\r\nzone, have six families, with one peculiar to them; while the Oriental\r\nregion, which is wholly tropical, possesses the five cosmopolitan families\r\nonly.\r\n\r\nThere are about 78 genera and 552 species of Anseres, giving 69 species to\r\na family, a high number compared with the Waders, and due to there being\r\nonly one very small family, the Colymbidæ. The distribution of the Anseres,\r\nbeing more determined by temperature than by barriers, the great regions\r\nwhich are so well indicated by the genera and families of most other orders\r\nof birds, hardly limit these, except in the case of the genera of Anatidæ.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Order X.--STRUTHIONES._\r\n\r\nFAMILY 126.--STRUTHIONIDÆ.

Vol. I. p. 445).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Struthious Birds recently extinct._\r\n\r\nA number of sub-fossil remains of birds, mostly large and some of gigantic\r\nsize, having affinities to the _Apteryx_ and, less closely, to the\r\nCassowaries, have been discovered in New Zealand. These are all classed by\r\nProfessor Owen in the genus _Dinornis_ and family _Dinornithidæ_; but Dr.\r\nHaast, from the study of the rich collections in the Canterbury (New\r\nZealand) Museum, is convinced that they belong to two distinct families and\r\nseveral genera. His arrangement is as follows. (See _Ibis_, 1874, p. 209).\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY 129.--DINORNITHIDÆ. (2 Genera, 7 Species.)\r\n\r\n_Dinornis_ (5 sp.); _Meionornis_ (2 sp.).\r\n\r\nThese had no hind toe, and include the largest species. Professor Newton\r\nthinks that they were absolutely wingless, being the only birds in which\r\nthe fore limbs are entirely wanting.\r\n\r\n\r\n{370}FAMILY 130.--PALAPTERYGIDÆ. (2 Genera, 4 Species.)\r\n\r\n_Palapteryx_ (2 sp.); _Euryapteryx_ (2 sp.).\r\n\r\nThese had a well-developed hind toe, and rudimentary wings.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY 131.--ÆPYORNITHIDÆ. (1 Genus, 3 Species.)\r\n\r\nA gigantic Struthious bird (_Æpyornis_), belonging to a distinct family,\r\ninhabited Madagascar.\r\n\r\nIt was first made known by its enormous eggs, eight times the bulk of those\r\nof the ostrich, which were found in a sub-fossil condition. Considerable\r\nportions of skeletons have since been discovered, showing that these huge\r\nbirds formed an altogether peculiar family of the order.\r\n\r\n\r\n_General Remarks on the Distribution of the Struthiones._\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the Ostrich, which has spread northward into the\r\nPalæarctic region, the Struthious birds, living and extinct, are confined\r\nto the Southern hemisphere, each continent having its peculiar forms. It is\r\na remarkable fact that the two most nearly allied genera, _Struthio_ and\r\n_Rhea_, should be found in Africa and South Temperate America respectively.\r\nEqually remarkable is the development of these large forms of wingless\r\nbirds in Australia and the adjacent islands, and especially in New Zealand,\r\nwhere we have evidence which renders it probable that about 20 species\r\nrecently coexisted. This points to the conclusion that New Zealand must,\r\nnot long since, have formed a much more extensive land, and that the\r\ndiminution of its area by subsidence has been one of the causes--and\r\nperhaps the main one--in bringing about the extinction of many of the\r\nlarger species of these wingless birds.\r\n\r\nThe wide distribution of the Struthiones may, as we have already suggested\r\n(Vol. I., p. 287.), be best explained, by supposing them to represent a\r\nvery ancient type of bird, developed at a time when the more specialized\r\ncarnivorous mammalia had {371}not come into existence, and preserved only\r\nin those areas which were long free from the incursions of such dangerous\r\nenemies. The discovery of Struthious remains in Europe in the Lower Eocene\r\nonly, supports this view; for at this time carnivora were few and of\r\ngeneralized type, and had probably not acquired sufficient speed and\r\nactivity to enable them to exterminate powerful and quick-running\r\nterrestrial birds. It is, however, at a much more remote epoch that we may\r\nexpect to find the remains of the earlier forms of this group; while these\r\nEocene birds may perhaps represent that ancestral wide-spread type which,\r\nwhen isolated in remoter continents and islands, became modified into the\r\nAmerican and African ostriches, the Emeus and Cassowaries of Australia, the\r\n_Dinornis_ and _Æpyornis_ of New Zealand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{372}CHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nTHE DISTRIBUTION OF THE FAMILIES AND GENERA OF REPTILES AND AMPHIBIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPTILIA.\r\n\r\n_Order I.--OPHIDIA._\r\n\r\nFAMILY 1.--TYPHLOPIDÆ.--(4 Genera, 70 Species.)\r\n\r\n                           GENERAL DISTRIBUTION.\r\n   __________________________________/\\__________________________________\r\n  /                                                                      \\\r\n  NEOTROPICAL| NEARCTIC  |PALÆARCTIC | ETHIOPIAN | ORIENTAL  | AUSTRALIAN\r\n  SUB-REGIONS|SUB-REGIONS|SUB-REGIONS|SUB-REGIONS|SUB-REGIONS|SUB-REGIONS.\r\n  -----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+------------\r\n             |           |           |           |           |\r\n  -- 2. 3. 4 |-- -- -- --| -- 2 -- 4 |1. 2. 3. 4 |1. 2. 3. 4 |1. 2 -- --\r\n             |           |           |           |           |\r\n\r\nThe Typhlopidæ, or Blind Burrowing Snakes, are widely scattered over the\r\nwarmer regions of the earth, but are most abundant in the Oriental and\r\nAustralian regions, and least so in the Neotropical.

They are\r\nespecially abundant in Africa, and the Palæarctic confines in South-western\r\nAsia. The common Viper ranges across the whole Palæarctic region from\r\nPortugal to Saghalien Island, reaching to 67° North Latitude, in\r\nScandinavia, and to 58° in Central Siberia. The genera, according to Dr.\r\nStrauch's synopsis, are distributed as follows:--\r\n\r\n_Vipera_ (17 sp.), which has the range of the family, extending over the\r\nwhole of the Palæarctic and Ethiopian regions, except Madagascar, and as\r\nfar as Ceylon, Siam, and Java, in the Oriental {386}region; _Echis_ (2\r\nsp.), inhabiting North Africa to Persia and to Continental India; and\r\n_Atheris_ (3 sp.), confined to West Africa.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Remarks on the General Distribution of Ophidia._\r\n\r\nThe Ophidia, being preeminently a Tropical order--rapidly diminishing in\r\nnumbers as we go north in the Temperate Zone, and wholly ceasing long\r\nbefore we reach the Arctic Circle--we cannot expect the two Northern\r\nregions to exhibit any great variety or peculiarity. Yet in their warmer\r\nportions they are tolerably rich; for, of the 25 families of snakes, 6 are\r\nfound in the Nearctic region, 10 in the Palæarctic, 13 in the Australian,\r\n16 in the Neotropical, 17 in the Ethiopian, and no less than 22 in the\r\nOriental, which last is thus seen to be by far the richest of the great\r\nregions in the variety of its forms of Ophidian life. The only regions that\r\npossess altogether peculiar families of this order, are the Ethiopian (3),\r\nand the Oriental (2); the usually rich and peculiar Neotropical region not\r\npossessing exclusively, any family of snakes; and what is still more\r\nremarkable, the Neotropical and Australian regions together, do not possess\r\na family peculiar to them. Every family inhabiting these two regions is\r\nfound also in the Oriental; and this fact, taken in connection with the\r\nsuperior richness of the latter region both in families and genera, would\r\nindicate that the Ophidia had their origin in the northern hemisphere of\r\nthe Old World (the ancient Palæarctic region) whence they spread on all\r\nsides, in successive waves of migration, to the other regions. The\r\ndistribution of the genera peculiar to, or highly characteristic of, the\r\nseveral regions is as follows:--\r\n\r\nThe Nearctic possesses 9; four of these belong to the Colubridæ, one to the\r\nPythonidæ, and four to the Crotalidæ. The Palæarctic region has only 2\r\npeculiar genera, belonging to the Colubridæ and Crotalidæ. The Ethiopian\r\nhas 25, belonging to 11 families; four to Colubridæ, five to Lycodontidæ,\r\nand three to Elapidæ. The Oriental has no less than 50, belonging to 15\r\nfamilies; five are Colubridæ, five Uropeltidæ, twelve Homalopsidæ, six\r\nLycodontidæ, three Amblycephalidæ, eight Elapidæ, and four {387}Crotalidæ.\r\nThe Australian has 16, belonging to three families only; eleven being\r\nElapidæ, and four Pythonidæ. The Neotropical has about 24, belonging to\r\neight families; ten are Colubridæ, six Pythonidæ, and the rest Dipsadidæ,\r\nScytalidæ, Amblycephalidæ, Elapidæ, and Crotalidæ.\r\n\r\nWe find then, that in the Ophidia, the regions adopted in this work are\r\nremarkably distinct; and that, in the case of the Oriental and Ethiopian,\r\nthe difference is strongly marked, a very large number of the genera being\r\nconfined to each region. It is interesting to observe, that in many cases\r\nthe affinity seems to be rather between the West Coast of Africa and the\r\nOriental region, than between the East Coast and the plains of India; thus\r\nthe Homalopsidæ--a highly characteristic Oriental family--occur on the West\r\nCoast of Africa only; the Dryiophidæ, which range over the whole Oriental\r\nregion, only occur in Madagascar and West Africa in the Ethiopian; the\r\ngenus _Dipsas_ is found over all the Oriental region and again in West\r\nAfrica. A cause for this peculiarity has been suggested in our sketch of\r\nthe past history of the Ethiopian region, Vol. I. p. 288. In the\r\nLycodontidæ, which are strictly confined to these two regions, the genera\r\nare all distinct, and the same is the case with the more widely distributed\r\nElapidæ; and although a few desert forms, such as _Echis_ and the Erycidæ,\r\nare common to Africa and the dry plains of India, this is evidently due to\r\nfavourable climatic conditions, and cannot neutralise the striking\r\ndifferences in the great mass of the family and generic forms which inhabit\r\nthe two regions. The union of Madagascar with the South-western part of the\r\nOriental region under the appellation Lemuria, finds no support in the\r\ndistribution of Ophidia; which, however, strikingly accords with the views\r\ndeveloped in the Third Part of this work, as to the great importance and\r\nhigh antiquity of the Euro-Asiatic continent, as the chief land-centre from\r\nwhich the higher organisms have spread over the globe.\r\n\r\n_Fossil Ophidia._--The oldest known remains of Ophidia occur in the Eocene\r\nformation in the Isle of Sheppey; others are found in the Miocene (Brown\r\nCoal) of Germany, and in some Tertiary beds in the United States. Most of\r\nthese appear to have been {388}large species belonging to the Pythonidæ, so\r\nthat we are evidently still very far from knowing anything of the earliest\r\nforms of this order. In some of the later Tertiary deposits the poison\r\nfangs of venomous species have been found; also a Colubrine snake from the\r\nUpper Miocene of the South of France.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Order II.--LACERTILIA._\r\n\r\nFAMILY 26.--TROGONOPHIDÆ.

The Oriental, instead of being the richest\r\nis one of the poorest regions, both in the number of families and in the\r\nnumber of peculiar genera it contains; while in both these respects the\r\nNeotropical is by far the richest. The distribution of the families is as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\nThe Nearctic region has 7 families, none of which are peculiar to it; but\r\nit has 3 peculiar genera--_Chirotes_, _Ophisaurus_, and _Phrynosoma_.\r\n\r\nThe Palæarctic region has 12 families, with two (Ophiomoridæ and\r\nTrogonophidæ, each consisting of a single species) peculiar; while it has 6\r\npeculiar or very characteristic genera, _Trogonophis_ in North Africa,\r\n_Psammodromus_ in South Europe, _Hyalosaurus_ in North Africa, _Scincus_ in\r\nNorth Africa and Arabia, _Ophiomorus_ in East Europe and North Africa, and\r\n_Phrynocephalus_ in Siberia, Tartary, and Afghanistan. We have here a\r\nstriking amount of diversity between the Nearctic and Palæarctic regions\r\nwith hardly a single point of resemblance.\r\n\r\nThe Ethiopian region has 13 families, only one of which (the Chamæsauridæ,\r\nconsisting of a single species) is altogether peculiar; but it possesses 21\r\npeculiar or characteristic genera, 9 belonging to the Zonuridæ, 2 to the\r\nSepidæ, 7 to the Geckotidæ, and 3 to the Agamidæ.\r\n\r\nThe Oriental region has only 8 families, none of which are peculiar; but\r\nthere are 28 peculiar genera, 6 belonging to the Scincidæ, 1 to the\r\nAcontiadæ, 5 to the Geckotidæ, and 16 to the Agamidæ. Many lizards being\r\nsand and desert-haunters, it is not surprising that a number of forms are\r\ncommon to the borderlands of the Oriental and Ethiopian regions; yet the\r\nSepidæ, so abundant in all Africa, do not range to the peninsula of India;\r\nand the equally Ethiopian Zonuridæ have only one Oriental species, found,\r\nnot in the peninsula but in the Khasya Hills. The Acontiadæ alone offer\r\nsome analogy to the distribution of the Lemurs, being found in Africa,\r\nMadagascar, Ceylon, and the Moluccas.\r\n\r\nThe Australian region has 11 families, 3 of which are {404}peculiar; and it\r\nhas about 40 peculiar genera in ten families, about half of these genera\r\nbelonging to the Scincidæ. Only 3 families of almost universal distribution\r\nare common to the Australian and Neotropical regions, with one species of\r\nthe American Iguanidæ in the Fiji Islands, so that, as far as this order is\r\nconcerned, these two regions have little resemblance.\r\n\r\nThe Neotropical region has 15 families, 6 of which are peculiar to it, and\r\nit possesses more than 50 peculiar genera. These are distributed among 12\r\nfamilies, but more than half belong to the Iguanidæ, and half the remainder\r\nto the Teidæ,--the two families especially characteristic of the\r\nNeotropical region. All the Nearctic families which are not of almost\r\nuniversal distribution are peculiarly Neotropical, showing that the\r\nLacertilia of the former region have probably been derived almost\r\nexclusively from the latter.\r\n\r\nOn the whole the distribution of the Lacertilia shows a remarkable amount\r\nof specialization in each of the great tropical regions, whence we may\r\ninfer that Southern Asia, Tropical Africa, Australia, and South America,\r\neach obtained their original stock of this order at very remote periods,\r\nand that there has since been little intercommunication between them. The\r\npeculiar affinities indicated by such cases as the Lepidosternidæ, found\r\nonly in the tropics of Africa and South America, and _Tachydromus_ in\r\nEastern Asia and West Africa, may be the results either of once widely\r\ndistributed families surviving only in isolated localities where the\r\nconditions are favourable,--or of some partial and temporary geographical\r\nconnection, allowing of a limited degree of intermixture of faunas. The\r\nformer appears to be the more probable and generally efficient cause, but\r\nthe latter may have operated in exceptional cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fossil Lacertilia._\r\n\r\nThese date back to the Triassic period, and they are found in most\r\nsucceeding formations, but it is not till the Tertiary period that forms\r\nallied to existing genera occur. These are at present too rare and too\r\nill-defined to throw much light on the geographical distribution of the\r\norder.\r\n\r\n\r\n{405}_Order III.--RHYNCOCEPHALINA._\r\n\r\nFAMILY 53.--RHYNCOCEPHALIDÆ.

It is confined to New Zealand, and is chiefly\r\nfound on small islands near the north-east coast, being very rare, if not\r\nextinct, on the main land.

America possesses both Crocodiles and\r\nAlligators; India, Crocodiles and Gavials; while Africa has Crocodiles\r\nonly. Both Crocodiles and Gavials are found in the northern part of the\r\nAustralian region, so that neither of the three families are restricted to\r\na single region.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fossil Crocodilia._\r\n\r\nThe existing families of the order date back to the Eocene period in\r\nEurope, and the Cretaceous in North America. In the south of England,\r\nAlligators, Gavials and Crocodiles, all occur in Eocene beds, indicating\r\nthat the present distribution of these families is the result of partial\r\nextinction, and a gradual restriction of their range--a most instructive\r\nfact, suggesting the true explanation of a large number of cases of\r\ndiscontinuous distribution which are sometimes held to prove the former\r\nunion of lands now divided by the deepest oceans. In more ancient\r\nformations, a number of Crocodilian remains have been discovered which\r\ncannot be classed in any existing families, and which, therefore, throw no\r\nlight on the existing distribution of the group.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Order V.--CHELONIA._\r\n\r\nFAMILY 57.--TESTUDINIDÆ.

(2 Genera, 5 Species.)\r\n\r\nGENERAL DISTRIBUTION.--All the warm and tropical Seas.\r\n\r\nThe Marine Turtles are almost universally distributed. _Dermatochelys_ (1\r\nsp.), is found in the temperate seas of both the Northern and Southern\r\nHemispheres; _Chelone_ (4 sp.), ranges over all the tropical seas--_C.\r\nviridis_, the epicureans' species, inhabiting the Atlantic, while _C.\r\nimbricata_ which produces the \"tortoiseshell\" of commerce is found in the\r\nIndian and Pacific oceans.\r\n\r\n\r\n{410}_Remarks on the Distribution of the Chelonia._\r\n\r\nThe four families into which the Chelonia are classed have all of them a\r\nwide distribution, though none are universal. The Ethiopian region seems to\r\nbe the richest, as it possesses 3 of the four families, while no other\r\nregion has more than 2; and it also possesses 7 peculiar genera. Next comes\r\nthe Neotropical region with 2 families and 6 peculiar genera; the\r\nAustralian with 3, and the Nearctic with 2 peculiar genera; while the\r\nOriental and Palæarctic regions possess none that are peculiar. There are\r\nabout 30 genera and 200 species in the whole order.\r\n\r\n_Fossil Chelonia._--The earliest undoubted remains of this order occur in\r\nthe Upper Oolite. These belong to the Cheloniidæ and Emydidæ, which are\r\nalso found in the Chalk. In the Tertiary beds Chelonia are more abundant,\r\nand the Trionychidæ now appear. The Testudinidæ are first met with in the\r\nMiocene formation of Europe and the Eocene of North America, the most\r\nremarkable being the gigantic _Colossochelys Atlas_ of the Siwalik Hills.\r\nIt appears, therefore, that the families of the order Chelonia were already\r\nspecialised in the Secondary period, a fact which, together with their more\r\nor less aquatic habits, sufficiently accounts for their generally wide\r\ndistribution. Species of _Testudo_, _Emys_, and _Trionyx_, are found in the\r\nUpper Miocene of the south of France.\r\n\r\n\r\n{411}AMPHIBIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Order I.--PSEUDOPHIDIA._\r\n\r\nFAMILY 1.--CÆCILIADÆ.

Many of the families have a very limited range, only\r\ntwo (Ranidæ and Polypedatidæ) being nearly universal; five more extend each\r\ninto five regions, while no less than thirteen of the families are confined\r\nto one, two, or three regions each. By far the richest region is the\r\nNeotropical, possessing 16 families (four of them peculiar) and about 50\r\npeculiar or very characteristic genera. Next comes the Australian, with 11\r\nfamilies (one of which is peculiar) and 16 peculiar genera. The Nearctic\r\nregion has no less than 9 of the families (two of them peculiar to it) and\r\n15 peculiar genera, 13 of which are tailed Batrachians which have here\r\ntheir metropolis. The other three regions have 9 families each; the\r\nPalæarctic has no peculiar family but no less than 15 peculiar genera; the\r\nEthiopian 1 family and 12 genera peculiar to it; and the Oriental, 19\r\ngenera but no family confined to it.\r\n\r\nIt is evident, therefore, that each of the regions is well characterised by\r\nits peculiar forms of Amphibia, there being only a few genera, such as\r\n_Hyla_, _Rana_, and _Bufo_ which have a wide range. The connection of the\r\nAustralian and Neotropical {423}regions is well shown in this group, by the\r\nPhryniscidæ, Hylidæ, and Discoglossidæ, which present allied forms in both;\r\nas well as by the genus _Liopelma_ of New Zealand, allied to the\r\nBombinatoridæ of South America, and the absence of the otherwise\r\ncosmopolitan genus _Rana_ from both continents. The affinity of the\r\nNearctic and Palæarctic regions is shown by the Proteidæ, which are\r\nconfined to them, as well as by the genus _Triton_ and almost the whole of\r\nthe extensive family of the Salamandridæ. The other regions are also well\r\ndifferentiated, and there is no sign of a special Ethiopian Amphibian fauna\r\nextending over the peninsula of India, or of the Oriental and Palæarctic\r\nregions merging into each other, except by means of genera of universal\r\ndistribution.\r\n\r\n_Fossil Amphibia._--The extinct Labyrinthodontia form a separate order,\r\nwhich existed from the Carboniferous to the Triassic period. No other\r\nremains of this class are found till we reach the Tertiary formation, when\r\nNewts and Salamanders as well as Frogs and Toads occur, most frequently in\r\nthe Miocene deposits. The most remarkable is the _Andrias scheuchzeri_ from\r\nthe Miocene of Oeningen, which is allied to _Sieboldia maxima_ the great\r\nsalamander of Japan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{424}CHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nTHE DISTRIBUTION OF THE FAMILIES OF FISHES, WITH THE RANGE OF SUCH GENERA\r\nAS INHABIT FRESH WATER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUB-CLASS I.--TELEOSTEI.\r\n\r\n_Order I.--ACANTHOPTERYGII._\r\n\r\nFAMILY 1.--GASTEROSTEIDÆ.

It is found in the temperate regions of both\r\nhemispheres, and has occurred on our southern coast.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Remarks on the Distribution of Fishes._\r\n\r\n_Marine Fish._--There are about 80 families of marine fishes, and of these\r\nno less than 50 are universally, or almost universally, distributed over\r\nthe seas and oceans of the globe. Of the remainder many are widely\r\ndistributed, some species even ranging from the North Atlantic to\r\nAustralia. Six families are confined to the Northern Seas, but four of\r\nthese consist of single species only, the other two being the Discoboli (2\r\ngenera, 11 sp.), and the Accipenseridæ (2 genera and 20 sp.). Only one\r\nfamily (Acanthoclinidæ) is confined to the Southern oceans, and that\r\nconsists of but a single species. Four families (Sternoptychidæ,\r\nStomiatidæ, Alepocephalidæ and Halosauridæ) are confined to the Atlantic\r\nOcean, while 13 are found only in the Pacific; and of the remainder several\r\nare more abundant in the Pacific than the Atlantic. Two families (Lycodidæ\r\nand Gadidæ) are found in the Arctic and Antarctic seas only, though the\r\n{465}latter family has a single species in the Indian seas. Among the\r\ncuriosities of distribution are,--the extensive genus _Diagramma_, confined\r\nto the Pacific with the exception of one species in the Mediterranean; the\r\nsingle species constituting the family Lophotidæ, found only in the\r\nMediterranean and Japan; the small family of Notacanthi, confined to\r\nGreenland, the Mediterranean, and West Australia; and the four families,\r\nSternoptychidæ, Stomiatidæ, Alepocephalidæ, and Halosauridæ, which are\r\nbelieved to inhabit exclusively the depths of the ocean, and are therefore\r\nvery rarely obtained.\r\n\r\n_Fresh-water Fish._--There are 36 families of fishes which inhabit fresh\r\nwater exclusively, and 5 others, which are both marine and fresh-water.\r\nThese present many interesting peculiarities of distribution. The\r\nNeotropical region is the richest in families, and probably also in genera\r\nand species. No less than 22 families inhabit it, and of these 6 are\r\naltogether peculiar. The Ethiopian and Nearctic regions each have 18\r\nfamilies, the former with 3, and the latter with 5 peculiar. Several\r\nisolated forms, requiring to be placed in distinct families, inhabit the\r\ngreat American lakes; and, no doubt, when the African lakes are equally\r\nwell known, they will be found also to possess many peculiar forms. The\r\nOriental region comes next, with 17 families, of which 3 are peculiar. The\r\nPalæarctic has 12, and the Australian 11 families, each with only 1\r\naltogether peculiar to it.\r\n\r\nIf we take those regions which are sometimes supposed to be so nearly\r\nrelated that they should be combined, we shall find the fresh-water fishes\r\nin most cases markedly distinct. The Nearctic and Palæarctic regions, for\r\nexample, together contain 20 families, but only 11 of these occur in both,\r\nand only 5 are exclusive inhabitants of these two regions. This shows an\r\namount of diversity that would not, perhaps, be exhibited by any other\r\nclass of animals. The Ethiopian and Oriental regions together possess 24\r\nfamilies, only 11 of which are found in both, and only 1 exclusively\r\ncharacteristic of the two. The Australian and Neotropical regions possess\r\ntogether 27 families, of which 7 are found in both, and 3 are exclusively\r\ncharacteristic of the two. This last fact is very interesting: the marine\r\nfamily of {466}Trachinidæ possesses a fresh-water genus, _Aphritis_, one\r\nspecies of which inhabits Tasmania, and two others Patagonia; the\r\nHaplochitonidæ (2 genera, 3 sp.) are found only in Tierra del Fuego, the\r\nFalkland Islands, and South Australia; and the Galaxidæ (1 genus, 12 sp.)\r\ninhabit the same regions, but extend to Chili, to New Zealand and to\r\nQueensland. We have here an illustration of that connection between South\r\nAmerica and Australia which is so strongly manifested in plants, but of\r\nwhich there are only scattered indications in most classes of animals. The\r\ndividing line across the Malay Archipelago, separating the Oriental from\r\nthe Australian regions, and which is so strikingly marked in mammalia and\r\nbirds, is equally so in fresh-water fishes. No less than six families have\r\ntheir eastern limits in Java and Borneo; while the extensive family of\r\nCyprinidæ has no less than 23 genera in Java and Borneo, but not a single\r\nspecies has been found in Celebes or the Moluccas.\r\n\r\nThe distribution of fresh-water fishes lends no support to the view that\r\nthe peninsula of India belongs to the Ethiopian region. A large proportion\r\nof the Oriental families are common to the whole region; while there is\r\nhardly a single example, of a characteristic Ethiopian family or genus\r\nextending into the peninsula of India and no further.\r\n\r\nAmong the special peculiarities of distribution, is the curious fish,\r\nforming the family Comephoridæ, which is confined to Lake Baikal, among the\r\nmountains of Central Asia, 2,000 feet above the sea, and a thousand miles\r\ndistant from the ocean; yet having its nearest allies in the exclusively\r\noceanic family of the mackerels (Scomberidæ). The Characinidæ are confined\r\nto Africa and South America, distinct genera inhabiting each region. The\r\nSalmonidæ are confined to the two northern regions, except a single species\r\nof a peculiar genus in New Zealand. The genus _Osteoglossum_ has a species\r\nin South America, another in the Sunda Islands, and a third in Queensland;\r\nwhile the curious Sirenoidei are represented by single species of peculiar\r\ngenera in Tropical America, Tropical Africa, and Tropical Australia.\r\n\r\n_Fossil Fishes._--Fishes have existed from a very remote era, and it is\r\nremarkable that the first whose remains have been {467}discovered belong to\r\nthe Ganoidei, a highly developed group which has continued to exist down to\r\nour times, and of which the sturgeon is the best known example. We may\r\ntherefore be sure that the Upper Silurian rocks in which these are found,\r\nalthough so very far back in geological history, do not by any means lead\r\nus to the time when the primitive fish-type appeared upon the earth. In the\r\nCarboniferous and Permian formations numerous remains of fishes are found,\r\nallied to the _Lepidosteus_ or Gar-pike of North America. The next group in\r\norder of appearance, are the Plagiostomata, containing the existing Sharks\r\nand Rays. Traces of these are found in the highest Silurian beds, and\r\nbecome plentiful in the Devonian and Carboniferous formations and in all\r\nsucceeding ages, being especially abundant in Cretaceous and Eocene strata.\r\nThe Holocephali appear first in the Oolitic period, and are represented by\r\nthe living Chimæridæ. The Dipnoi, to which belong the _Lepidosiren_ and\r\n_Ceratodus_, are believed to have existed in the Triassic period, from the\r\nevidence of teeth almost identical with those of the existing Australian\r\nfish. All the ancient fossil fishes belong to the above-mentioned groups,\r\nand many of them have little resemblance to existing forms. The Teleostean\r\nfishes, which form the great bulk of those now living, cannot be traced\r\nback further than the Cretaceous period, while by far the larger number\r\nfirst appear in the Tertiary beds. The Salmonidæ, Scopelidæ, Percidæ,\r\nClupeidæ, Scombresocidæ, Mugilidæ, and Siluridæ, or forms closely allied to\r\nthem, are found in the Cretaceous formation. In the Eocene beds we first\r\nmeet with Squammipennes, Cyprinidæ, Pleuronectidæ, Characinidæ, Murænidæ,\r\nGadidæ, Pediculati, Syngnathidæ, and Hippocampidæ.\r\n\r\nMost of these fossils represent marine fishes, those of fresh-water origin\r\nbeing rare, and of little importance as an aid in determining the causes of\r\nthe distribution of living forms. To understand this we must look to the\r\nvarious changes of the land surface which have led to the existing\r\ndistribution of all the higher vertebrates, and to those special means of\r\ndispersal which Mr. Darwin has shown to be possessed by all fresh-water\r\nproductions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{468}CHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nTHE DISTRIBUTION OF SOME OF THE MORE IMPORTANT FAMILIES AND GENERA OF\r\nINSECTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough insects are, for the most part, truly terrestrial animals, and\r\nillustrate in a very striking manner the characteristic phenomena of\r\ndistribution, it is impossible here to treat of them in much detail. This\r\narises chiefly from their excessive numbers, but also from the minuteness\r\nand obscurity of many of the groups, and our imperfect knowledge of all but\r\nthe European species. The number of described species of insects is\r\nuncertain, as no complete enumeration of them has ever been made; but it\r\nprobably exceeds 100,000, and these may belong to somewhere about 10,000\r\ngenera--many times more than all vertebrate animals together. Of the eight\r\nOrders into which Insects are usually divided, only two--the Coleoptera and\r\nLepidoptera--have been so thoroughly collected in all parts of the globe\r\nthat they can be used, with any safety, to compare their distribution with\r\nthat of vertebrate animals; and even of these it is only certain favourite\r\ngroups which have been so collected. Among Lepidoptera, for example,\r\nalthough the extensive group of Butterflies may be said, in a general\r\nsense, to be thoroughly well known--every spot visited by civilized man\r\nhaving furnished its quota to our collections--yet the minute Tineidæ, or\r\neven the larger but obscure Noctuidæ, have scarcely been collected at all\r\nin tropical countries, and any attempt to study their geographical\r\ndistribution would certainly lead to erroneous results. The same thing\r\noccurs, though perhaps in a less degree, among the Coleoptera. While the\r\nCarabidæ, Buprestidæ, and {469}Longicorns of the Tropics, are almost as\r\nwell known as those of the Temperate Zones, the Staphylinidæ, the smaller\r\nElateridæ, and many other obscure and minute groups, are very imperfectly\r\nrepresented from extra-European countries. I therefore propose to examine\r\nwith some care the distribution of the Butterflies, and the Sphingina among\r\nLepidoptera, and the following large and well-known families of\r\nColeoptera:--Cicindelidæ, Carabidæ, Lucanidæ, Cetoniidæ, Buprestidæ, and\r\nthe three families of Longicorns. These families together contain over\r\n30,000 species, classed in nearly 3,000 genera, and comprise a large\r\nproportion of the best known and most carefully studied groups. We may\r\ntherefore consider, that a detailed examination of their distribution will\r\nlead us to results which cannot be invalidated by any number of isolated\r\nfacts drawn from the less known members of the class.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Range of Insects in Time._--In considering how much weight is to be given\r\nto facts in insect distribution, and what interpretation is to be put upon\r\nthe anomalies or exceptional cases that may be met with, it is important to\r\nhave some idea of the antiquity of the existing groups, and of the rate at\r\nwhich the forms of insect life have undergone modification. The geological\r\nrecord, if imperfect in the case of the higher animals, is fragmentary in\r\nthe extreme as regards indications of former insect life; yet the positive\r\nfacts that it does disclose are of great interest, and have an important\r\nbearing on our subject. These facts and the conclusions they lead to have\r\nbeen discussed in our first volume (p. 166), and they must be carefully\r\nweighed in all cases of apparent conflict or incongruity between the\r\ndistribution of insects and that of the higher animals.\r\n\r\n\r\n{470}_Order--LEPIDOPTERA._\r\n\r\nSub-order--_Lepidoptera_ RHOPALOCERA, or BUTTERFLIES.\r\n\r\nFAMILY 1.--DANAIDÆ.

The large genus\r\n_Polyommatus_ (containing 325 species) has the same universal distribution\r\nas the entire family.

Well-marked sub-divisions of this large genus\r\nare characteristic of each great region--as the \"Æneas\" group in the\r\nNeotropical, the \"Paris\" group in the Oriental, the \"Ægeus\" group in the\r\nAustralian, the \"Zenobius\" group in the Ethiopian, and many others.

As the grouping of\r\nthese into genera is not yet satisfactorily accomplished, only the more\r\nextensive and best known groups will be here noticed. _Pamphila_ and\r\n_Hesperia_ are universally distributed; _Nisoniades_ seems to be only\r\nabsent from the Australian region. The Neotropical region is pre-eminently\r\nrich in Hesperidæ, 33 genera being found there, of which 20 are peculiar to\r\nit; the Australian region has 12 genera, only 1 (_Euschemon_) being\r\npeculiar; the Oriental has 18, with 3 peculiar; the Ethiopian, 13, with 3\r\npeculiar; the Palæarctic 6, with 1 (_Erynnis_) almost peculiar, a species\r\noccurring in Mexico; the Nearctic 9, with none peculiar, 4 being found also\r\nin the Neotropical region, 2 in the Palæarctic, and the rest being of wide\r\ndistribution. Many new genera have, however, been recently described in the\r\nUnited States, but it is impossible yet to determine how many, if any, of\r\nthese are peculiar. More than 100 species of the family are included in Mr.\r\nEdwards' \"Synopsis of North American Butterflies,\"--a very large number\r\nconsidering that Europe possesses only about 30.\r\n\r\n\r\n{481}Sub-order--LEPIDOPTERA HETEROCERA, or MOTHS.\r\n\r\nThe Lepidoptera Heterocera, or Moths, are of such immense extent, and are,\r\nbesides, so imperfectly known compared with the Butterflies, that it would\r\nserve no purpose to go into the details of their distribution; especially\r\nas most of the families and a considerable number of the genera are\r\ncosmopolitan. We propose therefore to notice only the Sphingina, which,\r\nbeing generally of large size and finely marked or coloured, and many of\r\nthem day-fliers, have been extensively collected; and whose numbers are\r\nmore manageable than the succeeding groups.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Group I.--SPHINGINA._\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY 17.--ZYGÆNIDÆ (46 Genera, about 530 Species).\r\n\r\nThe Zygænidæ are universally distributed, but many of the genera are\r\nrestricted in their range. _Zygæna_ (85 sp.) is mainly Palæarctic, but 2\r\nspecies are South African, and 1 North American; _Procris_ (22 sp.) has a\r\nscattered distribution, from the Palæarctic region to South America, South\r\nAfrica and North India; _Heterogynis_ (3 sp.) and _Dysauxis_ (3 sp.) are\r\nEuropean; _Pollanisus_ (3 sp.) is Australian; _Glaucopis_ (120 sp.) is\r\nmainly Neotropical, with a few Oriental; _Syntomis_ (94 sp.) is found in\r\nall the Old-World regions; and _Euchromia_ (150 sp.) is found in all warm\r\ncountries, though especially abundant in South America.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY 18.--CASTNIIDÆ (7 Genera, 63 Species).\r\n\r\nThe Castniidæ have an interesting distribution, being mainly Neotropical,\r\nwith four genera in Australia and New Guinea. _Castnia_, _Coronis_, and\r\n_Gazera_, with 51 species, are Neotropical; _Synemon_, _Euschemon_,\r\n_Damias_ and _Cocytia_, with 12 species, are Australian, the latter being\r\nfound only in the Papuan Islands.\r\n\r\n\r\n{482}FAMILY 19.--AGARISTIDÆ (13 Genera, 76 Species).\r\n\r\nThe Agaristidæ are beautiful diurnal moths, allied to the Castniidæ, but\r\nalmost confined to the Australian and Oriental regions, with a few in the\r\nEthiopian. The most important genera are,--_Agarista_ (21 sp.), Australia\r\nand New Guinea; _Eusemia_ (31 sp.), _Ægocera_ (7 sp.), Oriental and\r\nEthiopian regions; the other genera being confined to the islands from Java\r\nto New Guinea.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY 20.--URANIIDÆ (2 Genera, 12 Species).\r\n\r\nThese magnificent insects have a singular distribution. The gold-spangled\r\n_Urania_ (6 sp.) is characteristic of Tropical America, but a single\r\nspecies of great magnificence occurs in Madagascar. The large but\r\nsober-tinted _Nyctalemon_ (6 sp.) is found in the Neotropical, Oriental,\r\nand Australian regions.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY 21.--STYGIIDÆ. (3 Genera, 14 Species.)\r\n\r\nThese insects are confined to the Palæarctic and Neotropical regions, 2\r\ngenera in the former, 1 in the latter.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY 22.--ÆGERIIDÆ. (24 Genera, 215 Species.)\r\n\r\nThis family is found in all parts of the world except Australia. _Ægeria_\r\nis most abundant in Europe, but is found also in North and South America.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY 23.--SPHINGIDÆ. (40 Genera, 345 Species.)\r\n\r\nThe Sphinx Moths are cosmopolitan. The most important genera\r\nare,--_Macroglossa_ (26 sp.), _Chærocampa_ (46 sp.), and _Macrosila_ (21\r\nsp.), all cosmopolitan; _Sesia_ (12 sp.), Europe, Asia, and North America;\r\n_Deilephila_ (19 sp.), Palæarctic and Oriental regions, Nearctic region,\r\nand Chili; _Sphinx_ (21 sp.), Europe, {483}North and South America;\r\n_Smerinthus_ (29 sp.), all regions except Australia. Our Death's Head Moth\r\n(_Acherontia atropos_) ranges to Sierra Leone and the Philippine Islands.\r\n\r\n\r\n_General Remarks on the Distribution of the Diurnal Lepidoptera and\r\nSphingidea._\r\n\r\nThe Diurnal Lepidoptera or Butterflies, comprehend 431 genera and 7,740\r\nspecies, arranged in 16 families, according to Mr. Kirby's Catalogue\r\npublished in 1871. The Sphingidea consist of 135 genera and 1,255 species,\r\narranged in 7 families, according to the British Museum Catalogue dated\r\n1864; and as this includes all Mr. Bates' collections in America and my own\r\nin the East, it is probable that no very large additions have since been\r\nmade.\r\n\r\nThe distribution of the families and genera of Butterflies corresponds\r\ngenerally with that of Birds--and more especially with that of the\r\nPasserine birds--in showing a primary division of the earth into Eastern\r\nand Western, rather than into Northern and Southern lands. The Neotropical\r\nregion is by far the richest and most peculiar. It possesses 15 families of\r\nbutterflies, whereas the other regions have only from 8, in the Palæarctic,\r\nto 12 in the Ethiopian and Oriental regions; and as none of the Old World\r\nregions possess any peculiar families, the New World has a very clear\r\nsuperiority. In genera the preponderance is still greater, since the\r\nNeotropical region possesses about 200 altogether peculiar to it, out of a\r\ntotal of 431 genera, many of which are cosmopolitan. Comparing, now, the\r\nEastern regions with the Western, we have two peculiar families in the\r\nformer to 4 in the latter; while the Southern regions (Australian and\r\nNeotropical) possess not a single peculiar family in common.\r\n\r\nIn the Sphingidea the same general features recur in a less marked degree,\r\nthe Neotropical being the richest region; but here we have one family\r\n(Castniidæ) which appears to be confined to the two southern regions,--the\r\nAustralian and Neotropical.\r\n\r\nThe distribution of the genera affords us some facts of special interest,\r\nwhich must be briefly noticed. There are several {484}genera typically\r\ncharacteristic of the North Temperate regions which have a few species\r\nwidely scattered on mountains, or in the temperate parts of the Southern\r\nHemisphere. Chili possesses representatives of four of these\r\ngenera--_Argynnis_, _Lycæna_, _Colias_, and _Deilephila_; and this has been\r\nthought by some naturalists to be of such importance as to outweigh the\r\npurely Neotropical character of a large portion of the Chilian fauna, and\r\nto render it advisable to join it on, as an outlying portion of a great\r\nNorth Temperate zoological region. But when we remember that _Argynnis_\r\noccurs also in Java, and _Lycæna_ in New Zealand, while _Colias_ ranges to\r\nSouthern Africa, Malabar, and the Sandwich Islands, we can hardly admit the\r\nargument to be a sound one. For a fuller discussion of this question see\r\nVol. II., pp. 43-47. The remarkable fact of the existence of the otherwise\r\npurely Neotropical genus, _Urania_, in Madagascar is even more striking,\r\nsupported as it is by the Antillean, _Solenedon_, belonging to a family of\r\nMammalia otherwise confined to Madagascar, and by one or two Coleopterous\r\ngenera, to be noticed farther on as common to the two countries. Our view\r\nas to the true explanation of this and analogous phenomena will be found at\r\nVol. I., p. 284.\r\n\r\nThe division of the Castniidæ (a family almost confined to the Tropics),\r\nbetween the Neotropical and Australian regions, is also a very curious and\r\nimportant phenomenon, because it seems to point to a more remote connection\r\nbetween the two countries than that indicated by the resemblance between\r\nthe productions of South Temperate America with those of Australia and New\r\nZealand; but we have already shown that the facts may be explained in\r\nanother way. (See Vol. I., pp. 398 and 404).\r\n\r\nThe division of the Malay Archipelago between the Oriental and Australian\r\nregions is clearly marked in the Lepidoptera, and it is very curious that\r\nit should be so, for in this, if in any group of animals, we should expect\r\nan almost complete fusion to have been effected. Lepidoptera fly readily\r\nacross wide tracts of sea, and there is absolutely no climatal difference\r\nto interfere with their free migration from island to island. Yet we find\r\nno less than 10 genera abundant in the Indo-Malayan {485}sub-region which\r\nnever cross the narrow seas to the east of them; 6 others which only pass\r\nto Celebes; and 2 more which have extended from Java along the closely\r\nconnected line of islands eastwards to Timor. On the other side, we find 5\r\nstrictly Austro-Malayan genera, and 2 others which have a single\r\nrepresentative in Java. The following is a list of these genera:--\r\n\r\nINDO-MALAYAN GENERA:--_Amathusia_, _Thaumantis_, _Tanæcia_, _Eurytela_,\r\n_Ilerda_, _Zemeros_, _Taxila_, _Aphneus_, _Prioneris_, _Dercas_, _Clerome_,\r\n_Adolias_, _Apatura_, _Limenitis_, _Iolaus_, _Leptocircus_, (the last six\r\nreach Celebes); _Discophora_, _Thestias_; (the last two reach Timor.)\r\n\r\nAUSTRO-MALAYAN GENERA:--_Hamadryas_, _Hypocista_, _Mynes_, _Dicallaneura_,\r\n_Elodina_, _Hyades_, _Prothoë_ (the last two reach Java).\r\n\r\nThe most characteristic groups, which range over the whole Archipelago and\r\ngive it a homogeneous character, are the various genera of Danaidæ, the\r\ngenus _Elymnias_, and _Amblypodia_ with a few other Lycænidæ. These are all\r\nabundant and conspicuous groups, but they are nevertheless exceptions to\r\nthe general rule of limitation to one or other of the regions. The cause of\r\nthis phenomenon is probably to be found in the limitation of the larvæ of\r\nmany Lepidoptera to definite species, genera, and families of plants; and\r\nwe shall perhaps find, when the subject is carefully investigated, that the\r\ngroups which range over the whole Archipelago feed on genera of plants\r\nwhich have an equally wide range, while those which are limited to one\r\nregion or the other, have food-plants belonging to genera which are\r\nsimilarly limited. It is known that the vegetation of the two regions\r\ndiffers largely in a botanical sense, although its general aspect is almost\r\nidentical; and this may be the reason why the proportion of wide-ranging\r\ngenera is greater among such insects as feed upon dead wood, than among\r\nthose which derive their support from the juices of the living foliage.\r\nThis subject will be again discussed under the various families of\r\nColeoptera, and it will be well to bear in mind the striking facts of\r\ngeneric limitation which have been here brought forward.\r\n\r\n{486}Fossil Butterflies, apparently of existing genera, occur in the\r\nMiocene and Eocene formations, and an extinct form in the Lower Oolite; but\r\nthese cannot be held to give any adequate idea of the antiquity of so\r\nhighly specialised a group, which, in all probability, dates back to\r\nPalæozoic times, since one of the Bombycidæ,--a group almost as\r\nhighly-organised--has been discovered in the coal formation of Belgium.\r\n(See Vol. I. p. 168.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_Order--COLEOPTERA._\r\n\r\nGEODEPHAGA, or CARNIVOROUS GROUND BEETLES.\r\n\r\nThe Geodephaga consist of two families, Cicindelidæ and Carabidæ, differing\r\nin their form and habits no less than in their numbers and distribution.\r\nThe former, comprising about 800 species, are far more abundant and varied\r\nin Tropical regions; the latter, more than ten times as numerous, are\r\nhighly characteristic of the North Temperate zone, where fully half of all\r\nthe known species occur.\r\n\r\n\r\nCICINDELIDÆ. (35 Genera, 803 Species.)\r\n\r\nThe Cicindelidæ, or Tiger Beetles, are a moderately extensive group, spread\r\nover the whole globe, but much more abundant in tropical than in temperate\r\nor cold countries. More than half of the species (418) belong to the single\r\ngenus _Cicindela_, the only one which is cosmopolitan. The other large\r\ngenera are,--_Collyris_ (81 sp.), wholly Oriental; _Odontochila_ (57 sp.),\r\nSouth American, with species in Java and Celebes; _Tetracha_ (46 sp.),\r\nmostly South American, but with species in South Europe, North America, and\r\nAustralia; _Tricondyla_ (31 sp.), characteristic of the Oriental region,\r\nbut extending eastward to New Guinea; _Ctenostoma_ (26 sp.), wholly\r\nNeotropical; _Dromica_ (24 sp.), wholly African, south of Lake Ngami and\r\nMozambique; _Therates_ (18 sp.), wholly Malayan, from Singapore to New\r\nGuinea.\r\n\r\nThe genera are distributed in the several regions as follows:--the Nearctic\r\nregion has 5 genera, 3 of which are peculiar to it; the {487}Palæarctic has\r\n2, but none peculiar; the Ethiopian 13, with 11 peculiar; the Oriental 8,\r\nwith 3 peculiar; the Australian 9, with 2 peculiar; and the Neotropical 15,\r\nwith 10 peculiar. The connection between South America and Australia is\r\nshown by the latter country possessing 9 species of the characteristic\r\nSouth American genus _Tetracha_, as well as one of _Megacephala_. The small\r\nnumber of peculiar genera in the Oriental and Australian regions is partly\r\nowing to the circumstance that two otherwise peculiar Oriental genera have\r\nspread eastward to the Moluccas and New Guinea, a fact to be easily\r\nexplained by the great facilities such creatures have for passing narrow\r\nstraits, and by the almost identical physical conditions in the Malayan\r\nportion of the two regions. The insects of Indo-Malaya were better adapted\r\nto live in the Austro-Malay Islands than those of Australia itself, and the\r\nlatter group of islands have thus acquired an Oriental aspect in their\r\nentomology, though not without indications of the presence of an aboriginal\r\ninsect-fauna of a strictly Australian type. The relation of the Australian\r\nand Neotropical regions is exhibited by this family in an unusually\r\ndistinct manner. _Tetracha_, a genus which ranges from Mexico to La Plata,\r\nhas 9 species in Australia; while _Megacephala_ has 2 American and 1\r\nAustralian species. Another curious, and more obscure relation, is that\r\nbetween the faunas of Tropical America and Tropical Africa. This is also\r\nillustrated by the genus _Megacephala_, which has 4 African species as well\r\nas 2 South American; and we have also the genus _Peridexia_, which has 2\r\nspecies in South America and 2 in Madagascar.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the sub-regions are also well characterised by peculiar genera;\r\nas _Amblychila_ and _Omus_ confined to California and the Rocky Mountains;\r\n_Manticora_, _Ophryodera_, _Platychile_ and _Dromica_, characteristic of\r\nSouth Africa; _Megalomma_ and _Pogonostoma_ peculiar to the Mascarene\r\nIslands; and _Caledonica_ to the islands east of New Guinea. The extensive\r\nand elegant genus _Collyris_ is highly characteristic of the Oriental\r\nregion, over the whole of which it extends, only just passing the limits\r\ninto Celebes and Timor.\r\n\r\nThe Cicindelidæ, therefore, fully conform to those divisions of {488}the\r\nearth which have been found best to represent the facts of distribution in\r\nthe higher animals.\r\n\r\n\r\nCARABIDÆ. (620 Genera, 8500 Species.)\r\n\r\nThe enormous extent of this family, necessitates a somewhat general\r\ntreatment. It has been very extensively collected, while its classification\r\nhas been most carefully worked out, and a detailed exposition of its\r\ngeographical distribution by a competent entomologist would be of the\r\ngreatest interest. A careful study of Gemminger and Harold's Catalogue,\r\nhowever, enables me to sketch out the main features of its distribution,\r\nand to detail many of its peculiarities with considerable accuracy.\r\n\r\nThe Carabidæ are remarkable among insects, and perhaps among all\r\nterrestrial animals, as being a wonderfully numerous, varied, conspicuous,\r\nand beautiful group, which is pre-eminently characteristic of the\r\nPalæarctic region. So strikingly and unmistakably is this the case, that it\r\nmust be held completely to justify the keeping that region distinct from\r\nthose to which it has at various times been proposed to join it. Although\r\nthe Carabidæ are thoroughly well represented by hosts of peculiar genera\r\nand abundant species in every part of the world without exception, yet the\r\nPalæarctic region alone contains fully one-third, or perhaps nearer\r\ntwo-fifths, of the whole. It may also be said, that the group is a\r\ntemperate as compared with a tropical one; so that probably half the\r\nspecies are to be found in the temperate and cold regions of the globe,\r\nleaving about an equal number in the much more extensive tropical and warm\r\nregions. But, among the cold regions, the Palæarctic is pre-eminent. North\r\nAmerica is also rich, but it contains, by far, fewer genera and fewer\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nThe magnificent genus _Carabus_, with its allies _Procerus_ and\r\n_Procrustes_, containing about 300 species, all of large size, is almost\r\nwholly confined to the Palæarctic region, only 10 species inhabiting North\r\nAmerica, and 11 Temperate South America, with one on the African mountain\r\nof Kilimandjaro. Twelve large genera, containing together more than 2000\r\nspecies, are truly cosmopolitan, inhabiting both temperate and tropical\r\n{489}countries all over the globe; but many of these are more abundant in\r\nthe Palæarctic region than elsewhere. Such are _Scarites_, _Calosoma_,\r\n_Brachinus_, _Cymindis_, _Lebia_, _Chlænius_, _Platynus_, _Harpalus_,\r\n_Bembecidium_, _Pæcilus_, and _Argutor_. Of tropical cosmopolites, or\r\ngenera found in all the tropical regions, but not in the temperate zones,\r\nthere seem to be only four,--_Catascopus_, _Coptodera_, _Colopodes_, and\r\n_Caasnonia_. _Pheropsophus_ is confined to the tropics of the Old World;\r\nwhile _Drimostoma_, though widely scattered, is characteristic of the\r\nSouthern Hemisphere.\r\n\r\nThe Palæarctic region has about 50 genera of Carabidæ which are strictly\r\nconfined to it, the most important being,--_Leistus_ (30 sp.), _Procerus_\r\n(5 sp.), _Procrustes_, (17 sp.), _Zabrus_ (60 sp.), _Pristonychus_ (42\r\nsp.), and _Ophonus_ (60 sp.); but it possesses a large number in common\r\nwith the Nearctic region. The more remarkable of these are,--_Carabus_,\r\n_Nebria_, _Amara_, _Cyrtonotus_, _Bradycellus_, _Anopthalmus_, _Celia_,\r\n_Cychrus_, _Patrobus_, _Elaphrus_, _Notiophilus_, _Bradytus_,\r\n_Callisthenus_, _Blethisa_, and several others. Many too, though not\r\nstrictly confined to the North Temperate regions, are very abundant there,\r\nwith a few species isolated in remote countries, or widely scattered, often\r\nin an eccentric manner. Among these may be mentioned, _Trechus_ (120 sp.),\r\nall North Temperate but 8, which are scattered in Java, New Caledonia and\r\nSouth America; _Dyschirus_ (127 sp.), North Temperate, with 3 or 4 species\r\nin Australia, China and La Plata; _Omaseus_, (88 sp.), _Steropus_ (90 sp.),\r\n_Platysoma_ (114 sp.), and _Pterostichus_ (138 sp.), are mostly North\r\nTemperate, but each has a few species in the South Temperate zone, New\r\nZealand, Australia, Chili, and the Cape of Good Hope. _Dromius_ (54 sp.),\r\nis about two-thirds Palæarctic, the rest of the species being scattered\r\nover the world, in Chili, North and South America, South Africa, Burmah,\r\nCeylon, and New Zealand. The North Temperate genera _Calathus_ and\r\n_Olisthopus_, have each one species in New Zealand; _Percus_ has most of\r\nits species in South Europe, but 3 in Australia; _Abax_ is confined to the\r\nnorth temperate zone, but with one species in Madagascar; while\r\n_Læmosthenes_ is said to have a species identically the same in South\r\nEurope and Chili. Some of these apparent anomalies may be due to wrong\r\n{490}determination of the genera, but there can be little doubt that most\r\nof them represent important facts in distribution.\r\n\r\nThe Nearctic region is comparatively poor in Carabidæ. Its more important\r\npeculiar genera are,--_Dicælus_ (22 sp.), _Pasimachus_ (17 sp.),\r\n_Eurytrichus_ (9 sp.), _Sphæroderus_ (7 sp.), _Pinacodera_ (6 sp.), and\r\nothers of smaller extent, about 30 in all. It also possesses\r\nrepresentatives of a considerable number of Palæarctic genera, as already\r\nindicated; and a few of South American genera, of which _Helluomorpha_ and\r\n_Galerita_ are the most important.\r\n\r\nThe Neotropical region is very rich in peculiar forms of Carabidæ, as in\r\nalmost all other great groups. It possesses more than 100 peculiar genera,\r\nbut about 30 of these are confined to the South Temperate sub-region. The\r\nmore important peculiar genera of Tropical America are,--_Agra_ (144 sp.),\r\n_Ardistomus_ (44 sp.), _Schizogenius_ (25 sp.), _Pelecium_, (24 sp.),\r\n_Calophena_ (22 sp.), _Ctenodactyla_ (7 sp.). Among the Chilian and South\r\nTemperate peculiar forms are,--_Antarctia_ (29 sp.), _Scelodontis_ (10\r\nsp.), _Tropidopterus_ (4 sp.). Among the Neotropical genera with outlying\r\nspecies are,--_Pachyteles_ (50 sp.), one of which is West African;\r\n_Selenophorus_ (70 sp.), with 4 African, 4 Oriental, and 1 from New\r\nCaledonia; _Ega_ (11 sp), with one in the East Indies, and one in New\r\nCaledonia; _Galerita_, with 36 American species, 8 African, and 3 Indian;\r\n_Callida_ and _Tetragonoderus_, mostly American, but with a few African,\r\nOriental and Australian species; and _Pseudomorpha_, common to America and\r\nOceania.\r\n\r\nThe Australian region is almost equally rich, possessing about 95 peculiar\r\ngenera of Carabidæ, no less than 20 of which are confined to New Zealand.\r\nThe most important are, _Carenum_, _Promecoderus_, _Scaraphites_,\r\n_Notonomus_, _Ænigma_, _Sphallomorpha_, _Silphomorpha_, and _Adelotopus_.\r\nThe gigantic _Catadromus_ has 4 Australian species and 1 in Java;\r\n_Homalosoma_ has 31 species in Australia and New Zealand, and 1 in\r\nMadagascar. Celebes and New Guinea have each peculiar genera, and one is\r\ncommon to Australia and the Cape of Good Hope.\r\n\r\nThe Oriental region possesses 80 peculiar genera, 10 of which are confined\r\nto Ceylon. The more important are,--_Pericallus_, _Planetes_, and\r\n_Mormolyce_. _Distrigus_ is also characteristic of this {491}region, with\r\none species in Madagascar; while it has _Orthogonius_, _Hexagonia_,\r\n_Macrochilus_, and _Thyreopterus_ in common with the Ethiopian region, and\r\nis rich in the fine tropical genus, _Catascopus_.\r\n\r\nThe Ethiopian region has 75 peculiar genera, 8 of which are confined to\r\nMadagascar. The more important are,--_Polyhirma_, _Graphipterus_, and\r\n_Piezia_. _Anthia_ is chiefly African, with a few species in India;\r\n_Abacetus_ is wholly African, except a species in Java, and another in\r\nSouth Europe; and _Hypolithus_ is typically African, but with 7 species in\r\nSouth America and 1 in Java.\r\n\r\nThe facts of distribution presented by this important family, looked at\r\nbroadly, do not support any other division of the earth into primary\r\nregions than that deduced from a study of the higher animals. The amount of\r\nspeciality in each of these regions is so great, that no two of them can be\r\nproperly united; and in this respect the Carabidæ accord wonderfully with\r\nthe Vertebrates. In the details of distribution there occur many singular\r\nanomalies; but these are not to be wondered at, if we take into\r\nconsideration the immense antiquity of Coleopterous insects--which existed\r\nunder specialised forms so far back as the Carboniferous epoch,--the ease\r\nwith which they may be dispersed as compared with larger animals, and the\r\nfacilities afforded by their small size, habits of concealment, and often\r\nnocturnal habits, for adaptation to the most varied conditions, and for\r\nsurviving great changes of surface and of the surrounding organic forms.\r\nThe wonder rather is, not that there are so many, but so few cases of\r\nexceptional and anomalous distribution; and the fact that these creatures,\r\nso widely different from Vertebrates in organisation and mode of life, are\r\nyet on the whole subject to the same limitations of range as were found to\r\noccur among the higher animals, affords a satisfactory proof that the\r\nprinciples on which our six primary regions are founded, are sound; and\r\nthat they are well adapted to exhibit the most interesting facts of\r\ngeographical distribution, among all classes of animals.\r\n\r\nMuch stress has been laid on the fact of a few species of such typical\r\nEuropean genera as _Carabus_, _Dromius_, and others, being {492}found in\r\nChili and Temperate South America; and it has been thought, that in a\r\nsystem of Entomological regions this part of the world must be united to\r\nthe Northern Hemisphere. But these writers omit to take into account,\r\neither the large numbers of isolated and peculiar forms characteristic of\r\nSouth Temperate America, or the indications of affinity with Tropical\r\nAmerica and Australia, both of which are really more important than the\r\nconnection with Europe. The three important Chilian genera, _Cascelius_,\r\n_Barypus_, and _Cardiopthalmus_, are closely allied to the Australian\r\nPromecoderus; others, as _Omostenus_ and _Plagiotelium_, are quite\r\nisolated; while _Antarctia_ and _Metius_, according to Lacordaire, form a\r\ndistinct division of the family. Chili, too, has many species of\r\n_Pachyteles_, _Coptodera_, and other South American genera; and this\r\naffinity is far stronger in many other families than in the Carabidæ. The\r\nexistence of representatives of typical northern forms in Chili, is a fact\r\nof great interest, and may be accounted for in a variety of ways; (see Vol.\r\nII. p. 44) but it is not of such a magnitude as to be of primary importance\r\nin geographical distribution, and it can only be estimated at its fair\r\nvalue, by taking into account the affinities of all the groups inhabiting\r\nthat part of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\nLUCANIDÆ. (45 Genera, 529 Species.)\r\n\r\nPassing over a number of obscure families, we come to the remarkable group\r\nof the Lucanidæ, or Stag-beetles, which, being almost all of large size,\r\nand many of them of the most striking forms, have been very thoroughly\r\ncollected and assiduously studied.\r\n\r\nThe most curious feature of their general distribution, is their scarcity\r\nin Tropical South America, and their complete absence from Tropical North\r\nAmerica and the West Indian Islands, though they appear again in Temperate\r\nNorth America. In the New World they may, in fact, be looked upon as a\r\ntemperate group characteristic of the extra-tropical regions and the\r\nhighlands; while in the Old World, where they are far more abundant, they\r\nare distinctly tropical, being especially numerous {493}in the Oriental and\r\nAustralian regions. No genus has the range of the whole family, _Dorcus_\r\nand _Lucanus_ being absent from Africa, while _Cladognathus_ is unknown in\r\nthe New World and on the continent of Australia. The Oriental region is the\r\nrichest in peculiar forms, possessing 16 genera, 7 of which are wholly\r\nconfined to it, while 3 others only just range beyond it to North China on\r\nthe one side, or to the Austro-Malayan islands on the other. The Australian\r\nregion comes next, with 15 genera, of which 7 are wholly peculiar. South\r\nAmerica has 12 genera, 10 of which are peculiar. The Ethiopian region has\r\n10 genera, 7 of which are peculiar, and 2 of these are confined to the\r\nisland of Bourbon. The Palæarctic region has 8 genera, and the Nearctic 5;\r\none genus being peculiar to Europe, and two confined to Europe and North\r\nAmerica. The Ethiopian and Oriental regions have 3 genera in common and\r\npeculiar to them; the Oriental and Australian 3; while the Australian and\r\nNeotropical have 1 in common, to which may be added _Streptocerus_, which\r\nrepresents in Chili the Australian _Lamprima_.\r\n\r\nAmong the special features presented by the distribution of the Lucanidæ,\r\nmay be mentioned--the remarkable group of genera, _Pholidotus_,\r\n_Chiasognathus_, and _Sphenognathus_, confined to Temperate South America,\r\nthe Andes, and mountains of Brazil; _Lucanus_ (19 sp.), almost confined to\r\nthe Oriental and Palæarctic regions, three species only inhabiting North\r\nAmerica; _Odontolabris_ (29 sp.), wholly Oriental, with 2 sp. in Celebes;\r\n_Nigidius_ (11 sp.), Ethiopian, but with species in Formosa, the\r\nPhilippines, and Malacca; _Syndesus_ (11 sp.), common to Australia, New\r\nCaledonia, and South America; _Figulus_ (20 sp.), divided between Africa\r\nand Madagascar on the one hand, and Australia, with the Malay and Pacific\r\nIslands, on the other.\r\n\r\nThe facts of distribution here sketched out are in perfect accordance with\r\nthose of many groups of Vertebrates. The regions are sharply contrasted by\r\ntheir peculiar and characteristic genera; the several relations of those\r\nregions are truly indicated; while there is a comparatively small\r\nproportion of cases of anomalous or eccentric distribution.\r\n\r\n\r\n{494}CETONIIDÆ. (120 Genera, 970 Species.)\r\n\r\nAs representative of the enormous group of the Lamellicorns, which,\r\naccording to continental entomologists, forms a single family numbering\r\nnearly 7,000 species, we take the Cetoniidæ or Rose-Chafers. These comprise\r\na number of the most brilliant and beautifully-coloured insects, including\r\nthe gigantic _Goliathi_, which are among the largest of known beetles. They\r\nhave been assiduously collected in every part of the world, and their\r\nclassification has been elaborated by many of our most eminent\r\nentomologists.\r\n\r\nThe Cetoniidæ are especially abundant in tropical and warm countries, yet\r\nfar more so in the Old World than in the New; and in the Old World, the\r\nEthiopian region exhibits a marvellous richness in this family, no less\r\nthan 76 genera being found there, while 64, or more than half the total\r\nnumber, are peculiar to it. Next in richness, though still very far behind,\r\ncomes the Oriental region, with 29 genera, 17 of which are peculiar. The\r\nNeotropical has only 14 genera, but all except two are peculiar to it, and\r\none of these is not found out of the New World. The Australian region has\r\n11 genera, three only being peculiar. The Palæarctic region has 13, with 4\r\npeculiar; the Nearctic 7, with 2 peculiar. The affinities of the regions\r\nfor each other, as indicated by the genera confined to two adjacent\r\nregions, are in this family somewhat peculiar. The Ethiopian and Oriental\r\nshow the most resemblance, 6 genera being common and peculiar to the two;\r\nthe Oriental and the Australian are unusually well contrasted, having only\r\none genus exclusively in common, while 8 genera are found in the Indo-Malay\r\nIslands which do not cross the boundary to the Austro-Malayan division, and\r\nseveral others only pass to the nearest adjacent islands; on the other\r\nhand, the only large Australian genus, _Schizorhina_, is found in many\r\nparts of the Moluccas, but not further west. The Australian and Neotropical\r\nregions exhibit no direct affinity, the nearest ally to the South American\r\nGymnetidæ being _Clinteria_, an African and Asiatic genus; while not a\r\nsingle genus is common {495}to Australia and South America. The Nearctic\r\nand Palæarctic regions have 3 genera in common, which are found in no other\r\npart of the world.\r\n\r\nAmong the special features of interest connected with the distribution of\r\nthis family, we must first notice the exceptional richness of Madagascar,\r\nwhich alone possesses 21 peculiar genera. South Africa is also very rich,\r\nhaving 8 peculiar genera. _Stethodesma_ is very peculiar, being divided\r\nbetween South America and Mexico on the one hand, and West and South Africa\r\non the other. _Stalagmosoma_ is a desert genus, ranging from Persia to\r\nDongola. No genus is cosmopolitan, or even makes any approach to being so,\r\nexcept _Valgus_, which occurs in all the regions except the Neotropical;\r\nand even the family seems to be not universally distributed, since no\r\nspecies are recorded either from New Zealand, the Pacific Islands, or the\r\nAntilles.\r\n\r\nThe facts here brought forward, lead us to the conclusion that the\r\nCetoniidæ are an Old-World tropical family, which had been well developed\r\nin Africa and Asia before it spread to Australia and America; and that it\r\nis only capable of being freely dispersed in the warmer regions of the\r\nearth. This view will explain the absence of affinity between the\r\nAustralian and Neotropical regions, the only closer connection between\r\nwhich, has almost certainly occurred in the colder portions of the\r\nTemperate zone.\r\n\r\n\r\nBUPRESTIDÆ. (109 Genera, 2,686 Species.)\r\n\r\nThe next family suited to our purpose is that of the Buprestidæ, consisting\r\nas it does of many large and some gigantic species, generally adorned with\r\nbrilliant metallic colours, and attracting attention in all warm countries.\r\nAlthough these insects attain their full development of size and beauty\r\nonly in the Tropics, they are not much less abundant in the warmer parts of\r\nthe Temperate zone. In the Catalogue of the Coleoptera of Europe and the\r\nMediterranean Basin, by M. de Marseul (1863), we find 317 species of\r\nBuprestidæ enumerated, although {496}the district in question only forms a\r\npart of the Palæarctic region, which would thus seem to possess its full\r\nproportion of the species of this family. Confining ourselves to the\r\ngeneric forms, we find far less difference than usual between the numbers\r\npossessed by the tropical and the temperate regions; the richest being the\r\nAustralian, with 47 genera, 20 of which are peculiar; and the poorest the\r\nNearctic, with 24 genera, of which 7 are peculiar. The Oriental has 41\r\ngenera, 14 of which are peculiar; the Neotropical 39, of which the large\r\nproportion of 18 are peculiar; the Ethiopian 27, of which 6 are peculiar;\r\nand the Palæarctic also 27, but with 9 peculiar.\r\n\r\nA most interesting feature in the distribution of this family, is the\r\nstrong affinity shown to exist between the Australian and Neotropical\r\nregions, which have 4 genera common to both and found nowhere else; but\r\nbesides this, the extensive and highly characteristic Australian genus,\r\n_Stigmodera_, is closely related to a number of peculiar South American\r\ngenera, such as _Conognatha_, _Hyperantha_, _Dactylozodes_,--the last\r\naltogether confined to Chili and Temperate South America. Here we have a\r\nstriking contrast to the Cetoniidæ, and we can hardly help concluding,\r\nthat, as the latter is typically a tropical group, so the present family,\r\nalthough now so largely tropical, had an early and perhaps original\r\ndevelopment in the temperate regions of Australia, spreading thence to\r\nTemperate South America as well as to the tropical regions of Asia and\r\nAfrica. The Australian and Oriental regions have 4 genera exclusively in\r\ncommon, but they also each possess a number of peculiar or characteristic\r\ngenera, such as the Indo-Malayan _Catoxantha_ (which has only a single\r\nspecies in the Moluccas) and nine others of less importance; and the\r\nexclusively Austro-Malayan genus, _Sambus_, with five smaller groups, and\r\n_Cyphogastra_, with only 2 Indo-Malay species. The Oriental and Ethiopian\r\nregions are very distinct, only possessing the single genus, _Sternocera_,\r\nexclusively in common. The Nearctic and Palæarctic are also distinct, only\r\none genus, _Dicerca_, being confined to America (North and South) and\r\nEurope, a fact which again points to a southern origin for this family, and\r\nits comparatively recent extension into the {497}North Temperate zone. It\r\nmust be remembered, however, that in view of the immense geological\r\nantiquity of the existing families of Beetles, dating back certainly to the\r\nSecondary and probably to the Palæozoic epoch, \"comparatively recent\" may\r\nstill be of considerable antiquity.\r\n\r\nIt is somewhat singular that North and South America have no genera\r\nexclusively in common. The connection between South America and Africa\r\nseems to be shown,--by the genus _Psiloptera_, the mass of the species\r\nbeing divided between these regions, with a few widely scattered over the\r\nglobe; and the American genus _Actenodes_, which has one species in West\r\nAfrica. Somewhat allied, is the extensive genus _Polybothris_, strictly\r\nconfined to Madagascar. The genus _Agrilus_ is perhaps cosmopolitan,\r\nalthough no species of the family is recorded from New Zealand. Among the\r\npeculiarities of distribution we may notice,--the genus _Sponsor_, with 8\r\nspecies in the island of Mauritius, 1 in Celebes, and 1 in New Guinea;\r\n_Ptosima_, scattered between the United States, Mendoza in South Temperate\r\nAmerica, South Europe, the Philippine Islands, and North China;\r\n_Polycesta_, which besides inhabiting South America, North America, and\r\nEurope, has a single species in Madagascar; and _Belionota_, which has 8\r\nspecies African, 8 Indo-Malayan, 2 Austro-Malayan, and 1 in California. The\r\nextensive genus _Acmæodera_, is most abundant in the warm and dry portions\r\nof the Palæarctic, Ethiopian, and Nearctic regions, with some in the Andes\r\nand South Temperate America, a few in Brazil and the West Indies, and 1\r\nsaid to be from the Philippines. About one-third of the genera (containing\r\nmore than half the species) have a tolerably extensive range, while the\r\ngenera confined to single regions contain only about one-fourth of the\r\ntotal number of species.\r\n\r\nIt will, I think, be admitted, after a careful study of the preceding\r\nfacts, that the regions and sub-regions here adopted, serve to exhibit,\r\nwith great clearness, the chief phenomena of distribution presented by this\r\ninteresting family.\r\n\r\n\r\n{498}LONGICORNIA. (1,488 Genera, 7,576 Species).\r\n\r\nThe elegant and admired group of the Longicorn Beetles, is treated by\r\ncontinental authors as a single family, consisting of three\r\nsub-divisions--the Prionidæ, Cerambycidæ, and Lamiidæ of English\r\nentomologists. These are so closely related, and are so similar in form,\r\nhabits, and general distribution, that it will be best to consider the\r\nwhole as one group, noticing whatever peculiarities occur in the separate\r\ndivisions. The endless structural differences among these insects, have led\r\nto their being classed in an unusual number of genera, which average little\r\nmore than 5 species each; a number far below that in any of the other\r\nfamilies we have been considering, and probably below that which obtains in\r\nany of the more extensive groups of animals or plants. This excessive\r\nsubdivision of the genera, a large number of which consist of only one or\r\ntwo species, renders it difficult to determine with precision the relations\r\nof the several regions, since the affinities of these genera for each other\r\nare in many cases undetermined. A group of such enormous extent as this,\r\ncan only be properly understood after years of laborious study; we must\r\ntherefore content ourselves with such results as may be obtained from a\r\ngeneral survey of the group, and from a comparison of the range of the\r\nseveral genera, by means of a careful tabulation of the mass of details\r\ngiven in the recent Catalogue of Messrs. Gemminger and Harold and the noble\r\nwork of Lacordaire.\r\n\r\nThe proportionate extent of the three families of Longicorns is very\r\nunequal; the Prionidæ comprising about 7 per cent., the Cerambycidæ 44 per\r\ncent., and the Lamiidæ 49 per cent. of the total number of species; and the\r\ngenera are nearly in the same proportions, being almost exactly 10, 40, and\r\n50 per cent. of the whole, respectively; or, 135 Prionidæ, 609 Cerambycidæ,\r\nand 746 Lamiidæ. The several regions, however, present marked differences\r\nin their proportions of these families. In the two North Temperate regions,\r\nthe Cerambycidæ are considerably more numerous than the Lamiidæ, in the\r\nproportion of about 12 to {499}9; and in this respect the Neotropical\r\nregion agrees with them, though the superiority in the proportion of\r\nCerambycidæ is somewhat less. In the Old World tropical regions, however,\r\nand in Australia, the Lamiidæ greatly preponderate--being nearly double in\r\nthe Oriental and Ethiopian regions (or as 11 to 6), while in the Australian\r\nit is as 6 to 5. The Prionidæ show a similar difference, though in a less\r\ndegree; being proportionately more numerous in the North Temperate and\r\nNeotropical regions. Now, as regards the North Temperate regions, this\r\ndifference can be, to some extent explained, by a difference in the habits\r\nof the insects. The Lamiidæ, which both in the larva and perfect state have\r\nexceedingly powerful jaws, exclusively frequent timber trees, and almost\r\nalways such as are dead; while the Cerambycidæ, are generally more delicate\r\nand have weaker mandibles, and many of the species live on shrubs, dead\r\ntwigs, foliage, and even on flowers. The immense superiority of the Tropics\r\nin the number and variety of their timber trees, and the extent of their\r\nforests, sufficiently accounts for their superiority to the Temperate\r\nregions in the development of Lamiidæ; but the great excess of Cerambycidæ\r\nin South America as compared with the rest of the Tropics, is not to be so\r\nreadily explained.\r\n\r\nBearing in mind the different proportions of the families, as above noted,\r\nwe may now consider the distribution of the Longicorns as a whole. In\r\nnumber of generic forms, the Neotropical region, as in so many other\r\ngroups, has a marked superiority. It possesses 516 genera, 489 of which (or\r\nabout 19/20 of the whole) are peculiar to it. The Australian and Oriental\r\nregions come next, and are exactly equal, both possessing 360 genera, and\r\nhaving almost exactly the same proportion (in each case a little less than\r\n¾) peculiar. The Ethiopian region has 262 genera, with about 5/6 peculiar;\r\nthe Palæarctic 196, with 51 (rather more than ¼) peculiar; and the Nearctic\r\n111, with 59 (a little more than half) peculiar. The more isolated of the\r\nsub-regions are also well characterised by peculiar genera. Thus, Chili\r\nwith Temperate South America possesses 37, a large proportion being\r\nCerambycidæ; the Malagasi group 26, {500}with a preponderance of Lamiidæ;\r\nand New Zealand 12, of which the Cerambycidæ are only slightly in excess.\r\n\r\nThe relations between the Longicorn fauna of the several regions, are such\r\nas are in accordance with the dependence of the group on a warm climate and\r\nabundant vegetation; and indicate the efficiency of deserts and oceans as\r\nbarriers to their migration. The Neotropical and Australian regions have\r\nonly 4 genera in common, but these are sufficient to show, that there must\r\nprobably once have been some means of communication between the two\r\nregions, better adapted to these insects than any they now possess. The\r\nNearctic and Neotropical regions have 5, and the Nearctic and Palæarctic 13\r\ngenera in common and peculiar to them, the latter fact being the most\r\nremarkable, because no means of inter-communication now exists, except in\r\nhigh latitudes where the species of the Longicorns are very few. The\r\nOriental and Australian regions, on the other hand, are closely connected,\r\nby having no less than 52 genera of Longicorns in common and peculiar to\r\nthem. Most of these are specially characteristic of the Malay Archipelago,\r\noften extending over all the islands from Sumatra to New Guinea. This large\r\nnumber of wide-spread genera of course gives a character of uniformity to\r\nthe entire area over which they extend; and, with analogous facts occurring\r\nin other families, has led many entomologists to reject that division of\r\nthe Archipelago between the Australian and Oriental regions, which has been\r\nso overwhelmingly demonstrated to be the natural one in the case of the\r\nhigher animals. The general considerations already advanced in Chapter II.\r\nenable us, however, to explain such anomalies as this, by the great\r\nfacilities that exist for the transfer from island to island of such small\r\nanimals, so closely connected with woody vegetation in every stage of their\r\nexistence. That this is the true and sufficient explanation, is rendered\r\nclear by certain additional facts, which those who object to the sharp\r\ndivision of the Indo-Malay and Austro-Malay sub-regions have overlooked.\r\n\r\nAn analysis of all the Malay Longicorns proves, that besides the 52 genera\r\ncharacteristic of the Archipelago as a whole, there are 100 genera which\r\nare confined to one or other of its component {501}sub-regions. Many of\r\nthese, it is true, consist of single species confined to a single island,\r\nand we will not lay any stress on these; but there are also several\r\nimportant groups, which extend over the Indo-Malay or the Austro-Malay\r\nislands only, stopping abruptly at the dividing-line between them. For\r\nexample, on the Indo-Malay side we have _Euryarthrum_, _Leprodera_,\r\n_Aristobia_, _Coelosterna_, and _Entelopes_, and what is perhaps even more\r\nsatisfactory, the large genera _Agelasta_ and _Astathes_, abundant in all\r\nthe Indo-Malay islands, but having only one or two species just passing the\r\nboundary into Celebes. On the other side we have _Tethionea_,\r\n_Sphingnotus_, _Arrhenotus_, _Tmesisternus_ (the last three genera\r\nabounding from New Guinea to Celebes, but totally unknown further west),\r\n_Hestima_, _Trigonoptera_, _Amblymora_, _Stesilea_, _Enes_, and the large\r\ngenus _Micracantha_, with but a single species beyond the boundary,--30\r\nAustro-Malayan genera in all, each found in more than one island, but none\r\nof them extending west of Celebes. Here we have clear proof that the\r\nboundary line between the two great regions exists for Longicorns, as well\r\nas for all other animals; but in this case an unusually large number have\r\nbeen able to get across it. This, however, does not abolish the barrier,\r\nbut only proves that it is not absolutely effectual in all cases. Those who\r\nmaintain that the Malay Archipelago forms a single Coleopterous region,\r\nmust disprove or explain the instances of limited range here adduced.\r\n\r\nOut of nearly 1500 known genera of these insects, only one genus, _Clytus_,\r\nappears to be cosmopolitan. _Saperda_ and _Callichroma_ are the only others\r\nthat perhaps occur in every region; but these are both wanting over wide\r\ntracts of the earth's surface, _Saperda_ being absent from Tropical Africa\r\nand the Malay Archipelago; and _Callichroma_ from the Australian region,\r\nexcept one species in Polynesia. Many of the genera of Longicorns have a\r\nsomewhat wide and scattered distribution, indicative of decadence or great\r\nantiquity. _Mallodon_ and _Parandra_ are mostly South American, but have\r\nspecies in Australia and Africa; _Oeme_ is found in Brazil and the United\r\nStates, with one species in West Africa; _Ceratophorus_ has 2 species in\r\nWest Africa and 1 in New Zealand. _Xystrocera_ is mostly African, but has\r\nsingle species in {502}Borneo, Java, Amboyna and South Australia; _Phyton_\r\nhas one species in North America and the other in Ceylon; _Philagetes_ has\r\n2 in South Africa, and 1 in Malacca; _Toxotus_ abounds in North America and\r\nEurope, with one species away in Madagascar. _Leptura_ is also North\r\nTemperate, but has a species at the Cape, one at Singapore and a third in\r\nCelebes. _Necydalis_ has species in North and South America, Europe and\r\nAustralia. _Hylotrupes_ has 1 species in North America and Europe, and 1 in\r\nAustralia; _Leptocera_ prefers islands, being found only in Ceylon,\r\nMadagascar, Bourbon, Batchian, the New Hebrides, New Caledonia and North\r\nAustralia; _Hathliodes_ is Australian, with 1 species in Ceylon;\r\n_Schoenionta_ has 3 Malayan species, and 1 in Natal. Many other cases\r\nequally curious could be quoted, but these are sufficient. They cannot be\r\nheld to indicate any close relation between the distant countries in which\r\nspecies of the same genus are now found, but perhaps serve to remind us\r\nthat groups of great antiquity, and probably of great extent, have dwindled\r\naway, leaving a few surviving relics scattered far and wide, the sole\r\nproofs of their former predominance.\r\n\r\n\r\n_General Observations on the Distribution of Coleoptera._\r\n\r\nWe have now passed in review six of the most important and best known\r\ngroups of the Coleoptera or Beetles, comprising about 2,400 genera, and\r\nmore than 21,000 species. Although presenting certain peculiarities and\r\nanomalies, we have found that, on the whole, their distribution is in very\r\nclose accordance with that of the higher animals. We have seen reason to\r\nbelieve that these great and well-marked groups have a high geological\r\nantiquity, and by constantly bearing this fact in mind, we can account for\r\nmany of the eccentricities of their distribution. They have probably\r\nsurvived changes of physical geography which have altogether extinguished\r\nmany of the more highly organised animals, and we may perhaps gain some\r\ninsight into the bearing of those changes, by considering the cross\r\nrelations between the several regions indicated by them. On carefully\r\ntabulating the indications given by each of the groups here discussed, I\r\narrive at the following approximate result. The {503}best marked affinities\r\nbetween the regions are those between the Nearctic and Palæarctic,--the\r\nOriental and Australian,--the Australian and Neotropical,--which appear to\r\nbe about equal in each case. Next comes that between the Ethiopian and\r\nOriental on the one side, and the Ethiopian and Neotropical on the other,\r\nwhich also appear about equal. Then follows that between the Nearctic and\r\nNeotropical regions; and lastly, and far the least marked, that between the\r\nNorth Temperate and South Temperate regions. That the relation between the\r\nEthiopian and Neotropical region should be so comparatively well marked, is\r\nunexpected; but we must consider that in such a comparison as the present,\r\nwe probably get the result, not of any recent changes or intermigrations,\r\nbut of all the long series of changes and opportunities of migration that\r\nhave occurred during many geological epochs,--probably during the whole of\r\nthe Tertiary period, perhaps extending far back into the Secondary age.\r\n\r\nIt appears evident that Insects exhibit in a very marked degree in their\r\nactual distribution, the influence both of very ancient and very modern\r\nconditions of the earth's surface. The effects of the ancient geographical\r\nfeatures of the earth, are to be traced, in the large number of cases of\r\ndiscontinuous and widely scattered groups which we meet with in almost\r\nevery family, and which, to some extent, obscure the broader features of\r\ndistribution due to the period during which the barriers which divide the\r\nseveral primary regions have continued to exist. And this, which we may\r\nconsider as the normal distribution, is still further obscured in those\r\ncases where the barriers between existing regions are of such a nature as\r\nto admit of the free passage of insects or their larva in a variety of\r\nways, and (what is perhaps of more importance) in which the physical\r\nfeatures on both sides of the barrier are so nearly identical, as to admit\r\nof the ready establishment of such immigrants as may occasionally arrive.\r\nThese conditions concur, for some families of insects, in the case of the\r\nOriental and Australian portions of the Malay Archipelago; and it is there\r\nthat the normal distribution has been sometimes greatly obscured, but\r\nnever, as we have sufficiently shown, by any means obliterated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{504}CHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nAN OUTLINE OF THE GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION OF MOLLUSCA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Mollusca being for the most part marine, it does not enter into the\r\nplan of this work to go into much detail as to their distribution. The\r\norders and families will, however, be passed briefly in review, and all\r\nterrestrial and fresh-water groups discussed in somewhat more detail; with\r\nthe object of showing how far their distribution accords with that of the\r\nhigher animals, and to what extent the anomalies they present can be\r\nexplained by peculiarities of organisation and habits. If the views\r\nadvocated in our fifth chapter are correct, the regions there marked out\r\nmust apply to all classes of animals; and it will be the task of the\r\nstudents of each group, to work out in detail the causes which have led to\r\nany special features of distribution. All I can hope to do here, is to\r\nshow, generally and tentatively, that such a mode of treatment is possible;\r\nand that it is not necessary, as it is certainly not convenient or\r\ninstructive, to have a distinct set of \"Regions\" established for each class\r\nor order in the Animal and Vegetable Kingdoms.\r\n\r\nFor all the Marine groups I have merely summarised the information\r\ncontained in Mr. Woodward's _Manual of the Mollusca_, but in the case of\r\nthe Land Shells I have consulted the most recent general works, and\r\nendeavoured to give an accurate, though doubtless a very incomplete,\r\naccount of the most interesting facts in their distribution. As their\r\nclassification is very unsettled, I have followed that of the two latest\r\ngreat works, by Martens and Pfeiffer.\r\n\r\n\r\n{505}CLASS.--CEPHALOPODA.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Order I.--DIBRANCHIATA._\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY 1.--ARGONAUTIDÆ. \"Paper Nautilus.\" (1 Genus, 4 Species).\r\n\r\nDISTRIBUTION.--Open seas of all warm regions.

(10 Genera, 220 Species.)\r\n\r\nDISTRIBUTION.--These turreted shells are very widely distributed both in\r\ntemperate and tropical seas; and most of the genera have also a wide range.\r\nThere are about 400 extinct species, from so far back as the Lower Silurian\r\nto the Pliocene formations.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY 9.--CERITHIADÆ. (5 Genera, 190 Species.)\r\n\r\nDISTRIBUTION.--These are marine, estuary, or fresh-water shells, of an\r\nelongated spiral form; they have a world-wide distribution, but are most\r\nabundant in the Tropics. _Potamides_ (41 sp.), is the only fresh-water\r\ngenus, and is found in the rivers of Africa, India and China, to North\r\nAustralia and California. Another genus is exclusively fossil, and there\r\nare about 800 extinct species, ranging from the Trias to the Eocene and\r\nrecent formations.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY 10.--MELANIADÆ.

(10 Genera, 425 Species).\r\n\r\nDISTRIBUTION.--The genus TROCHUS (200 sp.) has a world-wide range, but the\r\nother genera are mostly tropical, and are most abundant in the Indian and\r\nPacific Oceans. There are more than 900 fossil species, found in all parts\r\nof the world, from the Lower Silurian to the Tertiary formations.\r\n\r\n\r\n{511}FAMILY 16.--HALIOTIDÆ. (6 Genera, 106 Species).\r\n\r\nDISTRIBUTION.--The Ear-shells are most abundant in the Indian and Pacific\r\nOceans; some are found on the east coasts of the Atlantic, but there are\r\nvery few in the West Indies. _Ianthina_ (10 sp.) consists of floating\r\noceanic snails found in the warm parts of the Atlantic. Three other genera\r\nare fossil, and there are near 500 fossil species of this family ranging\r\nfrom the Lower Silurian to the Pliocene formations.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY 17.--FISSURELLIDÆ. (5 Genera, 200 Species).\r\n\r\nDISTRIBUTION.--All seas. _Puncturella_ (6 sp.) is confined to Northern and\r\nAntarctic seas; _Rimula_ to the Philippines; and _Parmophorus_ (15 sp.)\r\nfrom the Cape of Good Hope to the Philippines and New Zealand. There are\r\nabout 80 fossil species, ranging from the Carboniferous formation to the\r\ndeposits of the Glacial epoch.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY 18.--CALYPTRÆIDÆ. (4 Genera, 125 Species).\r\n\r\nDISTRIBUTION.--The Calptræidæ, or Bonnet-Limpets, are found on the coasts\r\nof all seas from Norway to Chili and Australia; but are most abundant\r\nwithin the Tropics. The genera are all widely scattered. There are 75\r\nfossil species, ranging from the Devonian to recent formations.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY 19.--PATELLIDÆ. (4 Genera, 254 Species).\r\n\r\nDISTRIBUTION.--The Patellidæ, or Limpets, are universally distributed, and\r\nare as abundant in the temperate as in tropical seas. There are about 100\r\nfossil species, ranging from the Silurian to the Tertiary formations.\r\n\r\n\r\n{512}FAMILY 20.--DENTALIADÆ. (1 Genus, 50 Species).\r\n\r\nDISTRIBUTION.--The genus _Dentalium_ is found in the North Atlantic,\r\nMediterranean, West Indies and India. There are 125 fossil species, found\r\nin various formations as far back as the Devonian in Europe and in Chili.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY 21.--CHITONIDÆ. (1 Genus, 250 Species).\r\n\r\nDISTRIBUTION.--On rocky shores in all parts of the world. There are 37\r\nfossil species ranging back to the Silurian period.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Order II.--PULMONIFERA. (\"Terrestrial Molluscs.\")_\r\n\r\nThe Land and Fresh-water snails are so important and extensive a group, and\r\ntheir classification has been so carefully studied, that their geographical\r\ndistribution is a subject of much interest. The range of the genera will\r\ntherefore be given in some detail. For the Helicidæ I follow the classical\r\nwork of Albers--_Die Helicien_, Von Martens' Edition (1860); and for the\r\nOperculate families, Pfeiffer's _Monographia Pneumonopomorum Viventium_,\r\n2nd Supplement, 1865. The number of species is, of course, very\r\nconsiderably increased since these works were published (and the probable\r\namount of the increase I have in most cases indicated), but this does not\r\nmaterially affect the great features of their geographical distribution.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY 22.--HELICIDÆ. (33 Genera, 3,332 Species) (1860).\r\n\r\nGENERAL DISTRIBUTION.--Universal.\r\n\r\nThe Helicidæ, or Snails, are a group of immense extent and absolutely\r\ncosmopolitan in their range, being found in the most barren deserts and on\r\nthe smallest islands, all over the globe. They reach to near the line of\r\nperpetual snow on mountains, and {513}to the limit of trees or even\r\nconsiderably beyond it, in the Arctic regions; but they are comparatively\r\nvery scarce in all cold countries. The Antilles, the Philippine Islands,\r\nEquatorial America, and the Mediterranean sub-region are especially rich in\r\nthis family. Comparatively few of the genera, and those generally small\r\nones, are restricted to single regions; but on the other hand very few are\r\ngenerally distributed, only two--_Helix_ and _Pupa_--occurring in all the\r\nsix regions, while _Helix_ alone is truly cosmopolitan, occurring in every\r\nsub-region, in every country, and perhaps in every island on the globe.\r\n\r\nThe Neotropical region is, on the whole, the richest in this family, the\r\ncontinental Equatorial districts producing an abundance of large and\r\nhandsome species, while the Antilles are pre-eminent for the number of\r\ntheir peculiar forms. This region possesses 22 of the genera, and 6 of them\r\nare peculiar.\r\n\r\nThe Palæarctic region seems to come next in productiveness, but this may be\r\npartly owing to its having been so thoroughly explored. It possesses 16 of\r\nthe genera, and 3 of them are confined to it. The great mass of the species\r\nare found in the warm and fertile countries surrounding the Mediterranean\r\nSea.\r\n\r\nThe Ethiopian region has 13 genera, only one of which is peculiar.\r\n\r\nThe Australian region has 14 genera, 2 of which are confined to the Pacific\r\nIslands.\r\n\r\nThe Oriental has 15 genera and the Nearctic 12, but in neither case are\r\nthere any peculiar generic types.\r\n\r\nThe following is the distribution of the several genera taken in the order\r\nof their magnitude:--\r\n\r\n_Helix_ (1,115 sp.), cosmopolitan. This genus is divided into 88\r\nsub-genera, a number of which have a limited distribution. An immense\r\nquantity of species have been recently described, so that the number now\r\nexceeds 2,000.\r\n\r\n_Nanina_ (290 sp.) is characteristic of the Oriental and Australian\r\nregions, over the whole of which it extends, just entering the Palæarctic\r\nregion as far as North China and Japan. Isolated from this area is a small\r\ngroup of 4 species occurring {514}in West Africa. The number of species in\r\nthis genus have now been increased to about 400.\r\n\r\n_Clausilia_ (272 sp.) is most abundant in Europe, with a few species widely\r\nscattered in India, Malaya, China, Japan, Equatorial America, and one in\r\nPorto Rico. The described species have been increased to nearly 500.\r\n\r\n_Bulimulus_ (210 sp.) is American, and almost exclusively Neotropical,\r\nranging from Montevideo and Chili, to the West Indian Islands, California\r\nand Texas; with two sub-genera confined to the Galapagos Islands. About 100\r\nnew species have been described since the issue of the second edition of\r\nDr. Woodward's Manual.\r\n\r\n_Pupa_ (210 sp.) abounds most in Europe and the Arctic regions, but has a\r\nvery wide range, being scattered throughout Africa, continental India,\r\nAustralia, the Pacific Islands, North America to Greenland, and the\r\nAntilles; but it is absent from South America, the Himalayan and Malayan\r\nsub-regions, China and Japan. An extinct species has occurred abundantly in\r\nthe carboniferous strata of North America. About 160 additional species\r\nhave been described.\r\n\r\n_Bulimus_ (172 sp.) abounds most in Tropical South America; it is also\r\nfound from Burmah eastward through Malaya to the Solomon and Fiji Islands;\r\nthere are also scattered species in Patagonia, St. Vincents, Texas, St.\r\nHelena, and New Zealand. More than 100 additional species have been\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\n_Buliminus_ (132 sp.) ranges from Central and South Europe over the whole\r\nEthiopian and Oriental regions to North China, and through the Australian\r\nto New Zealand; there is also a single outlying species in the Galapagos\r\nIslands. About 50 more species have been described.\r\n\r\n_Cochlostyla_ (127 sp.) is almost peculiar to the Philippine Islands,\r\nbeyond which, are a species in Borneo, one in Java, and two in Australia.\r\nVery few new species have been added to this genus.\r\n\r\n_Achatinella_ (95 sp.) is absolutely confined to the Sandwich Island group.\r\nRecent researches have more than tripled the number of described species.\r\n\r\n{515}_Achatina_ (87 sp.) is most abundant and finest in the Ethiopian\r\nregion, over the whole of which it ranges; but there are also species in\r\nFlorida, the Antilles, the Sandwich Islands, Ceylon and India. The\r\ndescribed species are now more than doubled.\r\n\r\n_Hyalina_ (84 sp.) inhabits all Tropical America and the Antilles, North\r\nAmerica to Greenland, and Europe to the Arctic regions. Comparatively few\r\nnew species have been described.\r\n\r\n_Cylindrella_ (83 sp.) inhabits the West Indian islands and Guatemala to\r\nTexas, with a sub-genus in the Philippine Islands. Species since described\r\nhave more than trebled the number in this genus.\r\n\r\n_Cionella_ (67 sp.) is widely scattered; in India from Ceylon to the Khasia\r\nMountains, Brazil, New Granada, the West Indian islands, Palæarctic, and\r\nnorthern part of Nearctic regions, Pacific Islands, New Zealand, and Juan\r\nFernandez. About 20 new species have since been described.\r\n\r\n_Glandina_ (66 sp.), Peru to South Carolina and the Antilles, with three\r\nspecies in Central Africa and one in South Europe. About 40 species have\r\nbeen added to this genus.\r\n\r\n_Stenogyra_ (49 sp.), widely distributed: Tropical America and West Indies\r\nto Florida, South and West Africa, the Mediterranean region, India and the\r\nPhilippines. About a dozen new species have been described.\r\n\r\n_Succinea_ (41 sp.), widely scattered in all the regions, and in St.\r\nHelena, Juan Fernandez, Tahiti, Chiloe, Greenland, West Africa, Himalayas\r\nand Australia. The described species are now more than 100.\r\n\r\n_Partula_ (39 sp.), Solomon Islands to Tahiti and Sandwich Islands. This\r\ngenus has also been increased to near 100 species.\r\n\r\n_Streptaxis_ (34 sp.), most abundant in Tropical South America, but occurs\r\nin West Africa, the Seychelles and Rodriguez Islands, Ceylon and Burmah. It\r\nnow contains over 100 described species.\r\n\r\n_Spiraxis_ (33 sp.), Yucatan to Mexico, and less abundant in the West\r\nIndian Islands. About 20 species have been added.\r\n\r\n{516}_Macroceramus_ (27 sp.), Antilles, Florida, and Peru. The species have\r\nbeen more than doubled.\r\n\r\n_Vitrina_ (26 sp.), widely scattered through North and Central Europe,\r\nNorth-west America and Greenland, Abyssinia, Madagascar and South Africa,\r\nHimalayas to Burmah and Australia. Species since described have more than\r\ndoubled the number in this genus.\r\n\r\n_Orthalicus_ (23 sp.), Bolivia to Mexico and Antilles. This genus has been\r\nincreased to about 40 species.\r\n\r\n_Sagda_ (19 sp.), Antilles only. Very few new species, if any, have been\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\n_Zonites_ (12 sp.), South Europe, with one species of a distinct type in\r\nGuatemala. The number of species in this genus has been since about\r\ntripled.\r\n\r\n_Leucochroa_ (11 sp.), Mediterranean region to Syria and Arabia Petrea.\r\n\r\n_Simpulopsis_ (7 sp.), Bahia, Antilles, and far away in the Solomon\r\nIslands. Two or three have been added.\r\n\r\n_Balea_ (6 sp.), Middle and North Europe, Brazil, and the Island of Tristan\r\nd'Acunha.\r\n\r\n_Daudebardia_ (6 sp.), Central and South Europe; and a species has since\r\nbeen discovered in New Zealand.\r\n\r\n_Macrocycles_ (4 sp.), Chili, California, Oregon and Central North America.\r\n\r\n_Columna_ (3 sp.), West Africa, Princes Islands and Madagascar.\r\n\r\n_Stenopus_ (2 sp.), Island of St. Vincent (West Indies.)\r\n\r\n_Pfeifferia_ (2 sp.), Philippines and Moluccas.\r\n\r\n_Testacella_ (2 sp.), West Europe and Teneriffe. About 8 species have been\r\nsince described, including one from New Zealand.\r\n\r\nFossil species of _Helix_, _Bulimus_, _Achatina_, _Balea_, and _Clausilia_,\r\nare found in all the Tertiary formations; while a species of _Pupa_ (as\r\nalready stated) occurs in the carboniferous formation.

The distribution of the\r\ngenera is as follows:--\r\n\r\nPeculiar to or characteristic of the Oriental region are, _Opisthoporus_\r\n(11 sp.), _Rhiostoma_ (6 sp.), _Alycaeus_ (39 sp.), _Opisthostoma_ (1 sp.),\r\n_Hybocistis_ (3 sp.), _Pterocyclos_ (19 sp.), extending to the Moluccas;\r\n_Aulopoma_ (4 sp.), _Dermatocera_ (4 sp.), _Leptopoma_ (54 sp.), extending\r\nwest to the Seychelles and east to the Moluccas and New Guinea;\r\n_Cyclophorus_ (163 sp.), most abundant in the Oriental region, but ranges\r\nto Japan, to Chili, and all Tropical America, over the whole Australian\r\nregion, and to Natal and Madagascar; _Cataulus_ (15 sp.), confined to\r\nCeylon, the Neilgherries and Nicobar Islands; _Rhaphaulus_ (4 sp.), Penang\r\nto Ceram; _Streptaulus_ (1 sp.), _Arinia_ (3 sp.), _Pupinella_ (2 sp.),\r\n_Pupina_ (24 sp.), half in North India to Philippines and {521}Japan, the\r\nother half in Moluccas, New Guinea and Australia; _Cyclotopsis_ (2 sp.),\r\nIndia and Malaya; _Registoma_ (9 sp.), Philippines and Moluccas, New\r\nCaledonia and Pacific.\r\n\r\nCharacteristic of the Neotropical region are:--_Cyclotus_ (111 sp.), half\r\nin the Antilles and Tropical America, the rest in the Moluccas, China,\r\nMalaya, India, Natal, and the Seychelle Islands; _Megalomastoma_ (27 sp.),\r\nabundant in Cuba, West Indies and South America, others in India, Malaya,\r\nand Mauritius; _Jamaicia_ (2 sp.), Jamaica; _Licina_ (5 sp.), Antilles;\r\n_Choanopoma_ (49 sp.), Antilles; _Ctenopoma_ (25 sp.), Antilles;\r\n_Diplopoma_ (1 sp.), Cuba; _Adamsiella_ (15 sp.), Jamaica, Cuba, Guatemala;\r\n_Cyclostomus_ (113 sp.), abundant in Antilles, also occurs in Madagascar,\r\nArabia, Syria, Hungary and New Zealand; _Tudora_ (34 sp.), Antilles, and\r\none species in Algeria; _Cistula_ (40 sp.), _Chondropoma_ (94 sp.),\r\n_Bourcieria_ (2 sp.), Tropical America.\r\n\r\nPeculiar to or characteristic of the Palæarctic region are:--_Craspedopoma_\r\n(5 sp.), confined to Madeira, the Azores and Canaries; _Leonia_ (1 sp.),\r\nSpain and Algeria; _Pomatias_ (22 sp.), Europe and Canaries with a species\r\nin the Himalayas; _Cecina_ (1 sp.), Manchuria.\r\n\r\nThe Ethiopian region has the peculiar genus _Lithodion_ (5 sp.),\r\nMadagascar, Socotra and Arabia; and _Otopoma_ (19 sp.), Mascarene Islands\r\nand Socotra, with a species in Western India and another in New Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe Australian region is characterised by _Callia_ (3 sp.), in Ceram,\r\nAustralia, and the Philippines respectively; _Realia_ (7 sp.), New Zealand\r\nand the Marquesas Islands; _Omphalotropis_ (38 sp.), the Australian region,\r\nwith some species in India, Malaya, and the Mauritius.\r\n\r\nThe remaining genus, _Hydrocena_ (27 sp.), has a very widely scattered\r\ndistribution, being found in South Europe, Japan, the Cape, China, Malaya,\r\nNew Zealand, the Pacific Islands and Chili. From 10 to 20 per cent. of new\r\nspecies have been since described in most of the genera of this family.\r\n\r\n\r\n{522}FAMILY 30.--HELICINIDÆ. (7 Genera, 433 Species.)

The genera are:--\r\n\r\n_Trochatella_ (33 sp.), Antilles with a species in Venezuela, and another\r\nin Cambodja; _Lucidella_ (5 sp.), Antilles; _Helicina_ (274 sp.), Antilles,\r\nPacific Islands, Tropical America, Southern United States, Moluccas,\r\nAustralia, Philippines, Java, Andaman Islands and North China;\r\n_Schasicheila_ (5 sp.), Mexico, Guatemala and Bahamas; _Alcadia_ (28 sp.),\r\nAntilles; _Georissa_ (5 sp.) Moulmein to Burmah. About 10 per cent. of new\r\nspecies appear to have been since described in the larger genera of this\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\n\r\n_General Observations on the Distribution of the Land Mollusca._\r\n\r\nA consideration of the distribution of the families and genera of\r\nland-shells shows us, that although they possess some special features, yet\r\nthey agree in many respects with the higher animals in their limitation by\r\ngreat natural barriers, such as oceans, deserts, mountain ranges, and\r\nclimatal zones. A remarkable point in the distribution of these animals, is\r\nthe number of genera which have a very limited range, and also the\r\nprevalence of genera having species scattered, as it were at random, all\r\nover the earth. No less than 14 genera (or about one-sixth of the whole\r\nnumber) are confined to the Antilles, while the greater part of the\r\nsub-genera of modern authors are restricted to limited areas.\r\n\r\nIf we first compare the New World with the Old, we find the difference as\r\nregards genera quite as great as in most of the {523}vertebrates. In the\r\nHelicidæ, 10 genera are confined to the New, and 7 to the Old World, 16\r\nbeing common to both. In the Operculata the number of genera of restricted\r\nrange is greater,--the New World having 15, the Old World 32 genera, only 8\r\nbeing common to both. Of the New World genera 12 out of the 15 do not occur\r\nat all in South America; and of those of the Old World, 22 out of the 32\r\noccur in a single region only. If we take the northern and southern\r\ndivision proposed by Professor Huxley (the latter comprising the Australian\r\nand Neotropical regions), we find a much less well-marked diversity. Among\r\nthe Helicidæ only 4 are exclusively northern, 8 southern; while among the\r\nOperculata 22 are northern, 16 southern. The best way to compare these two\r\nkinds of primary division will be to leave out all those genera confined to\r\na single region each, and to take account only of those characteristic of\r\ntwo or more of the combined regions; which will evidently show which\r\ndivision is the most natural one for this group. The result is as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\nGENERA COMMON TO TWO OR MORE REGIONS IN, AND CONFINED TO, EACH PRIMARY\r\nDIVISION OF THE EARTH.\r\n\r\n               Helicidæ    Operculata.    Totals.\r\n  { Northern      0             0            0 }\r\n  { Southern      0             0            0 }\r\n\r\n  { Old World     1            12           13 }\r\n  { New World     4             0            4 }\r\n\r\nWe find then that the northern and southern division of the globe is not at\r\nall supported by the distribution of the terrestrial molluscs. It is indeed\r\nvery remarkable, that the connection so apparent in many groups between\r\nAustralia and South America is so scantily indicated here. The only facts\r\nsupporting it seem to be, the occurrence of _Geotrochus_ (a sub-genus of\r\nHelix) in Brazil, as well as in the Austro-Malayan and West Pacific Islands\r\nand North Australia; and of _Bulimus_ in the same two parts of the globe,\r\nbut peculiar sub-genera in each. But in neither case is there any affinity\r\nshown between the temperate portions of the two regions, so that we must\r\nprobably trace this resemblance to some more ancient diffusion of types\r\nthan that which led to the similarity of plants and insects. Still more\r\ncurious is the entire {524}absence of genera confined to, and\r\ncharacteristic of Africa and India. One small sub-genus of _Helix_,\r\n(_Rachis_), and one of _Achatina_, (_Homorus_), appear to have this\r\ndistribution,--a fact of but little significance when we find another\r\nsub-genus of _Helix_, (_Hapalus_), common and confined to Guinea and the\r\nPhilippine Islands; and when we consider the many other cases of scattered\r\ndistribution which cannot be held to indicate any real connection between\r\nthe countries implicated. No genus is confined to the Palæarctic and\r\nNearctic regions as a whole. A large number of sub-genera, many of them of\r\nconsiderable extent, are peculiar to one or other of these regions, but\r\nonly 3 sub-genera of _Helix_ and 2 of _Pupa_ are common and peculiar to the\r\ntwo combined, and these are always such as have an Arctic range and whose\r\ndistribution therefore offers no difficulty.\r\n\r\nWe find, then, that each of our six regions and almost all of our\r\nsub-regions are distinctly confirmed by the distribution of the terrestrial\r\nmollusca; while the different combinations of them which have at various\r\ntimes been suggested, receive little or no support whatever. Even those\r\nremarkably isolated sub-regions, New Zealand and Madagascar, have no\r\nstrictly peculiar genera of land-shells, although they both possess several\r\npeculiar sub-genera; being thus inferior in isolation to some single West\r\nIndian Islands, to the Sandwich Islands, and even to the North Atlantic\r\nIslands (Canaries, Madeira, and Azores), each of which have peculiar\r\ngenera. This of course, only indicates that the means by which land\r\nmollusca have been dispersed are somewhat special and peculiar. To\r\ndetermine in what this speciality consists we must consider some of the\r\nfeatures of the specific distribution of this group.\r\n\r\nThe range of genera, and even of sub-genera is, as we have seen, often wide\r\nand erratic, but as a general rule the species have a very restricted area.\r\n\r\nHardly a small island on the globe but has some land-shells peculiar to it.\r\nJuan Fernandez has 20 species, all peculiar. Madeira and Porto Santo have\r\n109 peculiar species out of a total of 134. Every little valley, plain, or\r\nhill-top, in the Sandwich Islands, though only a few square miles in\r\nextent, has its {525}peculiar species of _Achatinella_. Another striking\r\nfeature of the distribution of land molluscs, is the richness of islands as\r\ncompared with continents. The Philippines contain more species than all\r\nIndia; and those of the Antilles according to Mr. Bland almost exactly\r\nequal the numbers found in the entire American continent from Greenland to\r\nPatagonia. Taking the whole world, it appears that many more species of\r\nland-shells are found in the islands than on the continents of the globe, a\r\npeculiarity that obtains in no other extensive group of animals.\r\n\r\nLooking at these facts it seems probable, that the air-breathing molluscs\r\nhave been chiefly distributed by air- or water-carriage, rather than by\r\nvoluntary dispersal on the land. Even seas and oceans have not formed\r\nimpassable barriers to their diffusion; whereas they only spread on dry\r\nland with excessive slowness and difficulty. The exact mode in which their\r\ndiffusion is effected is not known, and it may depend on rare and\r\nexceptional circumstances; but it seems likely to occur in two ways. Snails\r\nfrequently conceal themselves in crevices of trees or under bark, or attach\r\nthemselves to stems or foliage, and either by their operculum or mucous\r\ndiaphragm, are able to protect themselves from the injurious effects of\r\nsalt water for long periods. They might therefore, under favourable\r\nconditions, be drifted across arms of the sea or from island to island;\r\nwhile wherever there are large rivers and occasional floods, they would by\r\nsimilar means be widely scattered over land areas. Another possible mode of\r\ndistribution is by means of storms and hurricanes, which would carry the\r\nsmaller species for long distances, and might occasionally transport the\r\neggs of the larger forms. Aquatic birds might occasionally get both shells\r\nand eggs attached to their feet or their plumage, and convey them across a\r\nwide extent of sea. But whether these, or some other unknown agency has\r\nacted, the facts of distribution clearly imply that some means of transport\r\nover water is, and has been, the chief agent in the distribution of these\r\nanimals; but that its action is very rare or intermittent, so that its\r\neffects are hardly perceptible in the distribution of single species.\r\n\r\nAnother important factor in enabling us to account for the\r\n{526}distribution of these animals is the geological antiquity of the\r\ngroup, and the amount of change exhibited in time, by species and genera.\r\nNow we find that most of the genera of land-shells range back to the Eocene\r\nperiod, while those inhabiting fresh water are found almost unchanged in\r\nthe Wealden. In North America a species of _Pupa_ and one of _Zonites_,\r\nhave been discovered in the coal measures, along with Labyrinthodonts; and\r\nthis fact seems to imply, that many more terrestrial molluscs would be\r\ndiscovered, if fresh-water deposits, made under favourable conditions, were\r\nmore frequently met with in the older rocks. If then the existing groups of\r\nland-molluscs are of such vast antiquity, and possess some means, however\r\nrarely occurring, of crossing seas and oceans, we need not wonder at the\r\nwide and erratic distribution now presented by so many of the groups; and\r\nwe must not expect them to conform very closely to those regions which\r\nlimit the range of animals of higher organization and less antiquity.\r\n\r\nThe total number of species of pulmoniferous mollusca is about 7,000,\r\naccording to the estimate of Mr. Woodward, brought down to 1868 by Mr.\r\nTate. But this number would be largely increased if the estimates of\r\nspecialists were taken. Mr. Woodward for example, gives 760 as the number\r\nof species in the West Indian Islands; whereas Mr. Thomas Bland, who has\r\nmade the shells of these islands a special study, considers that there were\r\n1,340 species in 1866. So, the land-shells of the Sandwich Islands are\r\ngiven at 267; but Mr. Gulick has added 120 species of Achatinellidæ,\r\nbringing the numbers up to nearly 400,--but no doubt several of these are\r\nso closely related that many conchologists would class them as varieties.\r\nThe land-shell fauna of the Antilles is undoubtedly the most remarkable in\r\nthe world, and it has been made the subject of much interesting discussion\r\nby Mr. Bland and others. This fauna differs from that of all other parts of\r\nthe globe in the proportions of the operculate to the inoperculate shells.\r\nThe Operculata of the globe are about one-seventh, the Inoperculata about\r\nsix-sevenths of the whole; and some general approximation to this\r\nproportion (or a much smaller one) exists in almost all the continents,\r\nislands, and {527}archipelagoes. In the Philippines, for example, the\r\nproportion of the Operculata is a little more than one-seventh; in the\r\nMauritius, between one-third and one-fourth; in Madeira, one-fourteenth; in\r\nthe whole American continent about one-eighth; but when we come to the\r\nAntilles we find them to amount to nearly five-sixths, about half the\r\nOperculata of the globe being found there!\r\n\r\nMr. Bland endeavours to ascertain the source of some of the chief genera\r\nfound in the West Indian Islands, on the principle that \"each genus has had\r\nits origin where the greatest number of species is found;\" and then\r\nproceeds to determine that some have had an African, some an Asiatic, and\r\nsome an American origin, while others are truly indigenous. But we fear\r\nthere is no such simple way of arriving at so important a result; and in\r\nthe case of groups of extreme antiquity like the genera of mollusca, it\r\nwould seem quite as possible that the origin of a genus is generally _not_\r\nwhere the greatest number of species are now found. For during the repeated\r\nchanges of physical conditions that have everywhere occurred since the\r\nEocene period (to go no further back) every genus must have made extensive\r\nmigrations, and have often become largely developed in some other district\r\nthan that in which it first appeared. As a proof of this, we not\r\nunfrequently find fossil shells where the species and even the genus now no\r\nlonger exists; as _Auricula_, found fossil in Europe, but only living in\r\nthe Malay and Pacific Islands; _Anastoma_ and _Megaspira_, now peculiar to\r\nBrazil, but fossil in the Eocene of France; and _Proserpina_ of the West\r\nIndies, found in the Eocene formation of the Isle of Wight. The only means\r\nby which the origin of a genus can satisfactorily be arrived at, is by\r\ntracing back its fossil remains step by step to an earlier form; and this\r\nwe have at present no means of doing in the case of the land-shells. Taking\r\nexisting species as our guide we should certainly have imagined that the\r\ngenus _Equus_ originated in Africa or Central Asia; but recent discoveries\r\nof numerous extinct species and of less specialized forms of the same type,\r\nseem to indicate that it originated in North America, and that the whole\r\ntribe of \"horses\" may be, for anything we yet know {528}to the contrary,\r\nrecent immigrants into the Old World! This example alone must convince us,\r\nthat it is impossible to form any conclusion as to the origin of a genus,\r\nfrom the distribution of existing species only.\r\n\r\nThe general conclusion we arrive at, therefore, is, that the causes that\r\nhave led to the existing distribution of the genera and higher groups of\r\nthe terrestrial mollusca are so complex, and have acted through such long\r\nperiods, that most of the barriers which limit the range of other\r\nterrestrial animals do not apply to them, although the species are, in most\r\ncases, strictly limited by them. Some means of diffusion--which, though\r\nprobably acting very slowly and at long intervals, and more powerfully on\r\ncontinents than between islands, is yet highly efficient when we consider\r\nthe long duration of genera--has, to a considerable extent, dispersed them\r\nacross continents, seas, and oceans. On the other hand, those mountain\r\nbarriers which separate many groups of the higher vertebrates, are\r\ngenerally less ancient than the genera of land-shells, which are thus often\r\ndistributed independently of them. In order to compare the distribution of\r\nthe terrestrial mollusca on equal terms with those of land animals\r\ngenerally, we must take genera of the former as equivalent to family groups\r\nof the latter; and we shall, I believe, then find that the distribution of\r\nthe sub-genera and smaller groups of species do accord mainly with those\r\ndivisions of the earth into regions and sub-regions which we have here\r\nindicated. Mr. Harper Pease, in a communication on Polynesian Land Shells\r\nin the _Proceedings of the Zoological Society_ for 1871 (p. 449), marks out\r\nthe limits of the Polynesian sub-region, so as exactly to agree with that\r\narrived at here from a consideration of the distribution of vertebrata; and\r\nhe says that this sub-region, (or region, as he terms it) is distinctly\r\ncharacterised by its land-shells from all the surrounding regions. The\r\ngenera (or sub-genera) _Partula_, _Pitys_, _Achatinella_, _Palaina_,\r\n_Omphalotropis_, and many others, are either wholly confined to this\r\nsub-region or highly characteristic of it. Mr. Binney, in his _Catalogue of\r\nthe Air-breathing Molluscs of North America_, marks out our Nearctic region\r\n(with almost identical limits) as most clearly {529}characterised. He also\r\narrives at a series of sub-divisions, which generally (though not exactly)\r\nagree with the sub-regions which I have here adopted. The Palæarctic, the\r\nEthiopian, and the Oriental regions, are also generally admitted to be well\r\ncharacterised by their terrestrial molluscs. There only remain the\r\nAustralian and the Neotropical regions, in which some want of homogeneity\r\nis apparent, owing to the vast development and specialisation of certain\r\ngroups in the islands which belong to these regions. The Antilles, on the\r\none hand, and the Polynesian Islands, on the other, are so rich in\r\nland-shells and possess so many peculiar forms, that, judged by these\r\nalone, they must form primary instead of secondary divisions. We have,\r\nhowever, already pointed out the inconvenience of any such partial systems\r\nof zoological geography, and the causes have been sufficiently indicated\r\nwhich have, in the case of land-shells as of insects, produced certain\r\nspecial features of distribution.\r\n\r\nWe therefore venture to hope, that conchologists will give us the advantage\r\nof their more full and accurate knowledge both of the classification and\r\ndistribution of this interesting group of animals, not to map out new sets\r\nof regions for themselves, but to show what kind of barriers have been most\r\nefficient in limiting the range of species, and how their distribution is\r\nactually effected, so as to be able to explain whatever discrepancies exist\r\nbetween the actual distribution of land-shells and that of the higher\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Order III.--OPISTHO-BRANCHIATA._\r\n\r\nThere are ten families in this order, all of which, as far as known, are\r\nwidely or universally distributed. Some of them are found fossil, ranging\r\nback to the Carboniferous epoch. They are commonly termed Sea-slugs, and\r\nhave either a thin small shell or none. We shall therefore simply enumerate\r\nthe families, with the number of genera and species as given by Mr.\r\nWoodward.\r\n\r\n{530}FAMILY 31.--TORNATELLIDÆ.

(5 Genera, 13 Species living, 0 fossil.)\r\n\r\n\r\n{531}_Order IV.--NUCLEO-BRANCHIATA._\r\n\r\nThese are oceanic, swimming molluscs, of a delicate texture. They are found\r\nin all warm seas, and range back to the Lower Silurian epoch. There are\r\nonly two families.\r\n\r\nFAMILY 41.--FIROLIDÆ. (2 Genera, 33 Species living, 1 fossil.)\r\n\r\nFAMILY 42.--ATLANTIDÆ. (5 Genera, 22 Species living, 159 fossil.)\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASS.--PTEROPODA.\r\n\r\nThese are swimming, oceanic mollusca, inhabiting both Arctic, Temperate,\r\nand Tropical seas. The three families have each a wide distribution in all\r\nthe great oceans. They range back to the Silurian period.\r\n\r\nFAMILY 1.--HYALEIDÆ. (9 Genera, 52 Species living, 95 fossil.)\r\n\r\nFAMILY 2.--LIMACINIDÆ. (4 Genera, 19 Species living, 0 fossil.)\r\n\r\nFAMILY 3.--CLIONIDÆ. (4 Genera, 14 Species living, 0 fossil.)\r\n\r\n\r\n{532}CLASS.--BRACHIOPODA.\r\n\r\nThese are sedentary, bivalve, marine mollusca, having laterally symmetrical\r\nshells, but with unequal valves. Both in space and time they are the most\r\nwidely distributed molluscs. They are found in all seas, and at all depths;\r\nand when any of the families or genera have a restricted range, it seems to\r\nbe due to our imperfect knowledge, rather than to any real geographical\r\nlimitations. In time they range back to the Cambrian formation, and seem to\r\nhave had their maximum development in the Silurian period. It is not,\r\ntherefore, necessary for our purpose, to do more than give the names of the\r\nfamilies with the numbers of the genera and species, as before.\r\n\r\nFAMILY 1.--TEREBRATULIDÆ. (5 Genera, 67 Species living, 340 fossil.)\r\n\r\nFAMILY 2.--SPIRIFERIDÆ. (4 Genera, 0 Species living, 380 fossil.)\r\n\r\nFAMILY 3.--RHYNCHONELLIDÆ.

(2 Genera, 10 Species living, 90 fossil.)\r\n\r\nFAMILY 8.--LINGULIDÆ. (2 Genera, 16 Species living, 99 fossil.)\r\n\r\n\r\n{533}CLASS.--CONCHIFERA.\r\n\r\nThe Conchifera, or ordinary Bivalve Molluscs, may be distinguished from the\r\nBrachiopoda by having their shells laterally unsymmetrical, while the\r\nvalves are generally (but not always) equal. They are mostly marine, but a\r\nfew inhabit fresh water. As the distribution of some of the families\r\npresents points of interest, we shall treat them in the same manner as the\r\nmarine Gasteropoda.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY 1.--OSTREIDÆ. (5 Genera, 426 Species.)\r\n\r\nDISTRIBUTION.--The Ostreidæ, including the Oysters and Scallops, are found\r\nin all seas, Arctic as well as Tropical. There are nearly 1,400 species\r\nfossil, ranging back to the Carboniferous period.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY 2.--AVICULIDÆ. (3 Genera, 94 Species.)\r\n\r\nDISTRIBUTION.--The Aviculidæ, or Wing-shells and Pearl Oysters, are\r\ncharacteristic of Tropical and warm seas, a few only ranging into temperate\r\nregions. Nearly 700 fossil species are known from various formations\r\nranging back to the Devonian, and Lower Silurian.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY 3.--MYTILIDÆ. (3 Genera, 217 Species.)\r\n\r\nDISTRIBUTION.--The Mytilidæ, or Mussels, have a world-wide distribution.\r\nThere is one fresh-water species, which inhabits the Volga.

(6 Genera, 360 Species.)\r\n\r\nDISTRIBUTION.--The Arcadæ are universally distributed, and are most\r\nabundant in warm seas. The genus _Leda_ is, however, abundant in Arctic and\r\nTemperate regions, and _Solenella_ is confined to the South Temperate zone.\r\nThere are near 1,200 fossil species, found in all strata as low as the\r\nLower Silurian.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY 5.--TRIGONIADÆ. (1 Genus, 3 Species.)\r\n\r\nDISTRIBUTION.--The living _Trigoniæ_ are confined to Australia, but there\r\nare 5 other genera fossil, containing about 150 species, and found in\r\nvarious formations from the Chalk to the Lower Silurian.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY 6.--UNIONIDÆ. (7 Genera, 549 Species.)\r\n\r\nDISTRIBUTION.--The Unionidæ, or Fresh-water Mussels, are found in all the\r\nfresh waters of the globe, but some of the genera are restricted.\r\n_Castalia_, _Mycetopus_ and _Mulleria_ are confined to the rivers of South\r\nAmerica; _Anodon_, to the Nearctic and Palæarctic regions; _Iridina_, and\r\n_Etheria_, to the rivers of Africa; _Unio_ has a universal distribution,\r\nbut is especially abundant in North America. About 60 fossil species are\r\nfound in the Tertiary and Wealden formations.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY 7.--CHAMIDÆ. (1 Genus, 50 Species.)\r\n\r\nDISTRIBUTION.--The Chamidæ, or Giant Clams, are confined to Tropical seas,\r\nchiefly among coral reefs.

(5 Genera, 103 Species.)\r\n\r\nFossils of doubtful affinity, from the Chalk formation.\r\n\r\n\r\n{535}FAMILY 9.--TRIDACNIDÆ. (1 Genus, 8 Species.)\r\n\r\nDISTRIBUTION.--The Tridacnidæ, or Clam-shells, are of very large size, and\r\nare confined to the Tropical regions of the Indian and Pacific Oceans. A\r\nfew species have been found fossil in the Miocene formation.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY 10.--CARDIADÆ. (1 Genus, 200 Species.)\r\n\r\nDISTRIBUTION.--The Cardiadæ, or Cockles, are of world-wide distribution.\r\nAnother genus is fossil, and nearly 400 fossil species are known, ranging\r\nback to the Upper Silurian formation.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY 11.--LUCINIDÆ (8 Genera, 178 Species.)\r\n\r\nDISTRIBUTION.--The Lucinidæ inhabit the Tropical and Temperate seas of all\r\nparts of the world; but the genus _Corbis_ is confined to the Indian and\r\nPacific Oceans, _Montacuta_ and _Lepton_, to the Atlantic. There are nearly\r\n500 extinct species, ranging from the Tertiary back to the Silurian\r\nformation.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY 12.--CYCLADIDÆ. (3 Genera, 176 Species.)\r\n\r\nDISTRIBUTION.--The Cycladidæ are small fresh- or brackish-water shells\r\nfound all over the globe. The genus _Cyclas_ is most abundant in the North\r\nTemperate zone, while _Cyrena_ inhabits the warmer shores of the Atlantic\r\nand Pacific, but is absent from the West Coast of America. There are about\r\n150 species fossil, ranging back from the Pliocene to the Wealden\r\nformations.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY 13.--CYPRINIDÆ. (10 Genera, 176 Species).\r\n\r\nDISTRIBUTION.--Universal. _Cyprina_ and _Astarte_ are Arctic and North\r\nTemperate; _Cardita_ is Tropical and South Temperate.

About 15 are restricted to the warmer\r\nseas of the globe; but several of these extend from Norway to New Zealand,\r\na distribution which may be called universal, and only 2 or 3 are\r\nabsolutely confined to Tropical seas. Two small families only, are confined\r\nto the Pacific and Indian Oceans. Marine fishes, on the other hand, have a\r\nmuch less cosmopolitan character, no less than 30 families having a limited\r\ndistribution, while 50 are universal. Some of these 30 families are\r\nconfined to the Northern seas, some to the Atlantic and Mediterranean, and\r\na considerable number to the Indian Ocean and Western Pacific. Many of\r\nthese families, it is true, are much smaller than those of the Mollusca,\r\nwhich seem to possess very few of those small isolated families of two or\r\nthree species only, which abound in all the Vertebrate classes. These\r\ndifferences are no doubt connected with the higher organisation of fishes,\r\nwhich renders them more susceptible to changed conditions of life; and this\r\nis indicated by the much less antiquity of existing families of fishes, the\r\ngreater part of which do not date back beyond the Cretaceous epoch, and\r\nmany of them only to the Eocene. In striking contrast we have the vast\r\nantiquity of most of the families of {538}Mollusca, as shown in the\r\nfollowing table of their range taken from Mr. Woodward's work, but\r\nre-arranged, and somewhat modified.\r\n\r\n  1 = Lower Silurian.        6 = Trias.                 11 = Eocene.\r\n  2 = Upper Silurian.        7 = Lower Oolite.          12 = Miocene.\r\n  3 = Devonian.              8 = Upper Oolite.          13 = Pliocene.\r\n  4 = Carboniferous.         9 = Lower Cretaceous.      14 = Recent.\r\n  5 = Permian.              10 = Upper Cretaceous.\r\n\r\n  +-----------------------------+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+\r\n  |    Range of Families of     |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\r\n  |  Mollusca in Time; arranged |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\r\n  | in their order of appearance|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\r\n  |      and disappearance.     | 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8| 9|10|11|12|13|14|\r\n  +-----------------------------+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+\r\n  | Productidæ                  |--|--|--|--|--|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\r\n  | Orthoceratidæ               |--|--|--|--|--|--|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\r\n  | Spiriferidæ, Orthidæ        |--|--|--|--|--|--|--|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\r\n  | Atlantidæ, Hyaleidæ         |--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|\r\n  | Pyramidellidæ, Turbinidæ    |--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|\r\n  | Ianthidæ, Chitonidæ         |--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|\r\n  | Lingulidæ                   |--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|\r\n  | Aviculidæ, Mytilidæ         |--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|\r\n  | Arcadæ, Trigoniadæ          |--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|\r\n  | Cyprinidæ, Anatinidæ        |--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|\r\n  | Nautilidæ                   |  |--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|\r\n  | Rhynchonellidæ, Craniadæ, } |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\r\n  |   Discinidæ               } |  |--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|\r\n  | Cardiadæ, Lucinidæ          |  |--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|\r\n  | Ammonitidæ                  |  |  |--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|  |  |  |  |\r\n  | Naticidæ, Calyptræidæ       |  |  |--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|\r\n  | Dentalidæ, Terebratulidæ    |  |  |--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|\r\n  | Helicidæ                    |  |  |  |--|  |  |  |  |  |  |--|--|--|--|\r\n  | Fissurellidæ, Tornatellidæ  |  |  |  |--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|\r\n  | Pectinidæ, Solenidæ         |  |  |  |--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|\r\n  | Cerithiadæ, Littorinidæ, }  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\r\n  |   Astartidæ              }  |  |  |  |  |  |--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|\r\n  | Belemnitidæ                 |  |  |  |  |  |  |--|--|--|--|  |  |  |  |\r\n  | Teuthidæ, Sepiadæ           |  |  |  |  |  |  |--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|\r\n  | Neritidæ, Patellidæ, }      |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\r\n  |   Bullidæ            }      |  |  |  |  |  |  |--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|\r\n  | Gastrochænidæ, Pholadidæ    |  |  |  |  |  |  |--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|\r\n  | Limnæidæ, Melaniadæ         |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |--|--|--|--|--|--|--|\r\n  | Chamidæ, Myadæ              |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |--|--|--|--|--|--|--|\r\n  | Cycladidæ, Veneridæ, }      |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\r\n  |   Tellinidæ          }      |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |--|--|--|--|--|--|--|\r\n  | Hippuritidæ                 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |--|--|  |  |  |  |\r\n  | Unionidæ                    |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |--|--|--|--|--|--|\r\n  | Strombidæ, Buccinidæ        |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |--|--|--|--|--|--|\r\n  | Conidæ, Volutidæ            |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |--|--|--|--|--|--|\r\n  | Auriculidæ, Cyclostomidæ    |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |--|--|--|--|--|--|\r\n  | Mactridæ                    |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |--|--|--|--|--|--|\r\n  | Limacidæ                    |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |--|--|--|--|\r\n  | Argonautidæ                 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |--|--|\r\n  | Tridacnidæ                  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |--|--|\r\n  +-----------------------------+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+\r\n\r\nNor is this enormous antiquity confined to family types alone. Many genera\r\nare equally ancient. The genus _Lingula_ has {539}existed from the earliest\r\nPalæozoic times down to the present day; while _Terebratula_,\r\n_Rhynchonella_, _Discina_, _Nautilus_, _Natica_, _Pleurotomaria_,\r\n_Patella_, _Dentalium_, _Mytilus_ and many other living forms, range back\r\nto the Palæozoic epoch. That groups of such immense antiquity, and having\r\npower to resist such vast changes of external conditions as they must have\r\nbeen subject to, should now be widely distributed, is no more than might\r\nreasonably be expected. It is only in the case of sub-genera and species,\r\nthat we can expect the influence of recent geological or climatal changes\r\nto be manifest; and it must be left to special students to work out the\r\ndetails of their distribution, with reference to the general principles\r\nfound to obtain among the more highly organised animals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{540}CHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nSUMMARY OF THE DISTRIBUTION, AND LINES OF MIGRATION, OF THE SEVERAL CLASSES\r\nOF ANIMALS.\r\n\r\nHaving already given summaries of the distribution of the several orders,\r\nand of some of the classes of land animals, we propose here to make a few\r\ngeneral remarks on the special phenomena presented by the more important\r\ngroups, and to indicate where possible, the general lines of migration by\r\nwhich they have become dispersed over wide areas.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAMMALIA.\r\n\r\nThis class is very important, and its past history is much better known\r\nthan that of most others. We shall therefore briefly summarise the results\r\nwe have arrived at from our examination of the distribution of extinct and\r\nliving forms of each order.\r\n\r\n_Primates._--This order, being pre-eminently a tropical one, became\r\nseparated into two portions, inhabiting the Eastern and Western Hemispheres\r\nrespectively, at a very early epoch. In consequence of this separation it\r\nhas diverged more radically than most other orders, so that the two\r\nAmerican families, Cebidæ and Hapalidæ, are widely differentiated from the\r\nApes, Monkeys, and Lemurs of the Old World. The Lemurs were probably still\r\nmore ancient, but being much lower in organisation, they became extinct in\r\nmost of the areas where the higher forms of Primates became developed.\r\nRemains found in the Eocene formation indicate, that the North American and\r\nEuropean {541}Primates had, even at that early epoch, diverged into\r\ndistinct series, so that we must probably look back to the secondary period\r\nfor the ancestral form from which the entire order was developed.\r\n\r\n_Chiroptera._--These are also undoubtedly very ancient. The most\r\ngeneralised forms--the Vespertilionidæ and Noctilionidæ--are the most\r\nwidely distributed; while special types have arisen in America, and in the\r\nEastern Hemisphere. Remains found in the Upper Eocene formation of Europe\r\ndiffer little from species still living in the same countries; so that we\r\ncan form no conjecture as to the origin or migration, of the group. Their\r\npower of flight would, however, enable them rapidly to spread over all the\r\ngreat continents of the globe.\r\n\r\n_Insectivora._--This very ancient group, now probably verging towards\r\nextinction, appears to have originated in the Northern continent, and never\r\nto have reached Australia or South America. It may, however, have become\r\nextinct in the latter country owing to the competition of the numerous\r\nEdentata. The Insectivora now often maintain themselves amidst more highly\r\ndeveloped forms, by means of some special protection. Some burrow in the\r\nearth,--like the moles; others have a spiny covering,--as the hedgehog's\r\nand several of the Centetidæ; others are aquatic,---as the _Potamogale_ and\r\nthe desman; others have a nauseous odour,--as the shrews; while there are\r\nseveral which seem to be preserved by their resemblance to higher\r\nforms,--as the elephant-shrews to jerboas, and the tupaias to squirrels.\r\nThe same need of protection is shown by the numerous Insectivora inhabiting\r\nMadagascar, where the competing forms are few; and by one lingering in the\r\nAntilles, where there are hardly any other mammalia.\r\n\r\n_Carnivora._--Although perhaps less ancient than the preceding, this form\r\nof mammal is far more highly organised, and from its earliest appearance\r\nappears to have become dominant in the world. It would therefore soon\r\nspread widely, and diverge into the various specialised types represented\r\nby existing families. Most of these appear to have originated in the\r\nEastern Hemisphere, the only Carnivora occurring in North {542}American\r\nMiocene deposits being ancestral forms of Canidæ and Felidæ. It seems\r\nprobable, therefore, that the order had attained a considerable development\r\nbefore it reached the Western Hemisphere. The Procyonidæ, now confined to\r\nAmerica, are not very ancient; and the occurrence of a few allied forms in\r\nthe Himalayas (_Ælurus_ and _Æluropus_) render it probable that their\r\ncommon ancestors entered North America from the Palæarctic region during\r\nthe Miocene period, but being a rather low type they have succumbed under\r\nthe competition of higher forms in most parts of the Eastern Hemisphere.\r\nBears and Weasels are probably still more recent emigrants to America. The\r\naquatic carnivora (Seals, &c.) are, as might be expected, more widely and\r\nuniformly distributed, but there is little evidence to show at what period\r\nthe type was first developed.\r\n\r\n_Ungulata._--These are the dominant vegetable-feeders of the great\r\ncontinents, and they have steadily increased in numbers and in\r\nspecialisation from the oldest Tertiary times to the present day. Being\r\ngenerally of larger size and less active than the Carnivora, they have\r\nsomewhat more restricted powers of dispersal. We have good evidence that\r\ntheir wide range over the globe is a comparatively recent phenomenon.\r\nTapirs and Llamas have probably not long inhabited South America, while\r\nRhinoceroses and Antelopes were once, perhaps, unknown in Africa, although\r\nabounding in Europe and Asia. Swine are one of the most ancient types in\r\nboth hemispheres; and their great hardiness, their omnivorous diet, and\r\ntheir powers of swimming, have led to their wide distribution. The sheep\r\nand goats, on the other hand, are perhaps the most recent development of\r\nthe Ungulata, and they seem to have arisen in the Palæarctic region at a\r\ntime when its climate already approximated to that which now prevails.\r\nHence they are pre-eminently a Temperate group, never found within the\r\nTropics except upon a few mountain ranges.\r\n\r\n_Proboscidea._--These huge animals (the Elephants and Mastodons) appear to\r\nhave originated in the warmer parts of the Palæarctic region, but they soon\r\nspread over all the great {543}continents, even reaching the southern\r\nextremity of America. Their extinction has probably depended more on\r\nphysical than on organic changes, and we can clearly trace their almost\r\ntotal disappearance to the effects of the Glacial epoch.\r\n\r\n_Rodentia._--Rodents are a very dominant group, and a very ancient one.\r\nOwing to their small size and rapid powers of increase, they soon spread\r\nover almost every part of the globe, whence has resulted a great\r\nspecialisation of family types in the South American continent which\r\nremained so long isolated. They are capable of living wherever there is any\r\nkind of vegetable food, hence their range will be determined rather by\r\norganic than by physical conditions; and the occupation of a country by\r\nenemies or by competing forms, is probably the chief cause which has\r\nprevented many of the families from acquiring a wide range. The occurrence\r\nof isolated species of the South American families, Octodontidæ and\r\nEchimyidæ in the Ethiopian and Palæarctic regions, is an indication that\r\nthe range of many of the families has recently become less extensive.\r\n\r\n_Edentata._--These singular and lowly-organised animals appear to have\r\nbecome almost restricted to the two great Southern lands--South Africa and\r\nSouth America--at an early period; and, being there free from the\r\ncompetition of higher forms, developed a number of remarkable types often\r\nof huge size, of which the Megatherium is one of the best known. The\r\nincursion of the highly-organised Ungulates and Carnivora into Africa\r\nduring the Miocene epoch, probably exterminated most of them in that\r\ncontinent; but in America they continued in full force down to the\r\nPost-Pliocene period; and even now, the comparatively diminutive Sloths,\r\nAnt-eaters, and Armadillos, form a large and important portion of the\r\nfauna.\r\n\r\n_Marsupialia and Monotremata._--These are probably the representatives of\r\nthe most ancient and lowly-organised types of mammal. They once existed in\r\nthe northern continents, whence they spread into Australia; and being\r\nisolated, and preserved from the competition of the higher forms which soon\r\narose in other parts of the world, they have developed into a variety of\r\ntypes, which, however, still preserve a general {544}uniformity of\r\norganisation. One family, which continued to exist in Europe till the\r\nlatter part of the Miocene period, reached America, and has there been\r\npreserved to our day.\r\n\r\n_Lines of Migration of the Mammalia._--The whole series of phenomena\r\npresented by the distribution of the Mammalia, looked at broadly, are in\r\nharmony with the view that the great continents and oceans of our own epoch\r\nhave been in existence, with comparatively small changes, during all\r\nTertiary times. Each one of them has, no doubt, undergone considerable\r\nmodifications in its area, its altitude, and in its connection with other\r\nlands. Yet some considerable portion of each continent has, probably, long\r\nexisted in its present position, while the great oceans seem to have\r\noccupied the same depressions of the earth's crust (varied, perhaps, by\r\nlocal elevations and subsidences) during all this vast period of time.\r\nHence, allowing for the changes of which we have more or less satisfactory\r\nevidence, the migrations of the chief mammalian types can be pretty clearly\r\ntraced. Some, owing to their small size and great vitality, have spread to\r\nalmost all the chief land masses; but the majority of the orders have a\r\nmore restricted range. All the evidence at our command points to the\r\nNorthern Hemisphere as the birth-place of the class, and probably of all\r\nthe orders. At a very early period the land communication with Australia\r\nwas cut off, and has never been renewed; so that we have here preserved for\r\nus a sample of one or more of the most ancient forms of mammal. Somewhat\r\nlater the union with South America and South Africa was severed; and in\r\nboth these countries we have samples of a somewhat more advanced stage of\r\nmammalian development. Later still, the union by a northern route between\r\nthe Eastern and Western Hemispheres appears to have been broken, partly by\r\na physical separation, but almost as effectually by a lowering of\r\ntemperature. About the same period the separation of the Palæarctic region\r\nfrom the Oriental was effected, by the rise of the Himalayas and the\r\nincreasing contrast of climate; while the formation of the great\r\ndesert-belts of the Sahara, Arabia, Persia, and Central Asia, helped to\r\ncomplete the separation of {545}the Temperate and Tropical zones, and to\r\nrender further intermigration almost impossible.\r\n\r\nIn a few cases--of which the Rodents in Australia and the pigs in\r\nAustro-Malaya are perhaps the most striking examples--the distribution of\r\nland-mammals has been effected by a sea-passage either by swimming or on\r\nfloating vegetation; but, as a rule, we may be sure that the migrations of\r\nmammalia have taken place over the land; and their presence on islands is,\r\ntherefore, a clear indication that these have been once connected with a\r\ncontinent. The present class of animals thus affords the best evidence of\r\nthe past history of the land surface of our globe; and we have chiefly\r\nrelied upon it in sketching out (in Part III.) the probable changes which\r\neach of our great regions has undergone.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Birds._\r\n\r\nAlthough birds are, of all land-vertebrates, the best able to cross seas\r\nand oceans, it is remarkable how closely the main features of their\r\ndistribution correspond with those of the Mammalia. South America possesses\r\nthe low Formicaroid type of Passeres,--which, compared with the more highly\r\ndeveloped forms of the Eastern Hemisphere, is analogous to the Cebidæ and\r\nHapalidæ as compared with the Old World Apes and Monkeys; while its Cracidæ\r\nas compared with the Pheasants and Grouse, may be considered parallel to\r\nthe Edentata as compared with the Ungulates of the Old World. The\r\nMarsupials of America and Australia, are paralleled among birds, in the\r\nStruthionidæ and Megapodiidæ; the Lemurs and Insectivora preserved in\r\nMadagascar are represented by the Mascarene Dididæ; the absence of Deer and\r\nBears from Africa is analogous to the absence of Wrens, Creepers, and\r\nPheasants; while the African Hyracidæ and Chrysochloridæ among mammals, may\r\nwell be compared with the equally peculiar Coliidæ and Musophagidæ among\r\nbirds.\r\n\r\nFrom these and many other similarities of distribution, it is clear that\r\nbirds have, as a rule, followed the same great lines of migration as\r\nmammalia; and that oceans, seas, and deserts, have {546}always to a great\r\nextent limited their range. Yet these barriers have not been absolute; and\r\nin the course of ages birds have been able to reach almost every habitable\r\nland upon the globe. Hence have arisen some of the most curious and\r\ninteresting phenomena of distribution; and many islands, which are entirely\r\ndestitute of mammalia, or possess a very few species, abound in birds,\r\noften of peculiar types and remarkable for some unusual character or habit.\r\nStriking examples of such interesting bird-faunas are those of New Zealand,\r\nthe Sandwich Islands, the Galapagos, the Mascarene Islands, the Moluccas,\r\nand the Antilles; while even small and remote islets,--such as Juan\r\nFernandez and Norfolk Island, have more light thrown upon their past\r\nhistory by means of their birds, than by any other portion of their scanty\r\nfauna.\r\n\r\nAnother peculiar feature in the distribution of this class is the\r\nextraordinary manner in which certain groups and certain external\r\ncharacteristics, have become developed in islands, where the smaller and\r\nless powerful birds have been protected from the incursions of mammalian\r\nenemies, and where rapacious birds--which seem to some degree dependent on\r\nthe abundance of mammalia--are also scarce. Thus, we have the Pigeons and\r\nthe Parrots most wonderfully developed in the Australian region, which is\r\npre-eminently insular; and both these groups here acquire conspicuous\r\ncolours very unusual, or altogether absent, elsewhere. Similar colours\r\n(black and red) appear, in the same two groups, in the distant Mascarene\r\nislands; while in the Antilles the parrots have often white heads, a\r\ncharacter not found in the allied species on the South American continent.\r\nCrests, too, are largely developed, in both these groups, in the Australian\r\nregion only; and a crested parrot formerly lived in Mauritius,--a\r\ncoincidence too much like that of the colours as above noted, to be\r\nconsidered accidental.\r\n\r\nAgain, birds exhibit to us a remarkable contrast as regards the oceanic\r\nislands of tropical and temperate latitudes; for while most of the former\r\npresent hardly any cases of specific identity with the birds of adjacent\r\ncontinents, the latter often show hardly any differences. The Galapagos and\r\nMadagascar {547}are examples of the first-named peculiarity; the Azores and\r\nthe Bermudas of the last; and the difference can be clearly traced to the\r\nfrequency and violence of storms in the one case and to the calms or steady\r\nbreezes in the other.\r\n\r\nIt appears then, that although birds do not afford us the same convincing\r\nproof of the former union of now disjoined lands as we obtain from mammals,\r\nyet they give us much curious and suggestive information as to the various\r\nand complex modes in which the existing peculiarities of the distribution\r\nof animals have been brought about. They also throw much light on the\r\nrelation between distribution and the external characters of animals; and,\r\nas they are often found where mammalia are quite absent, we must rank them\r\nas of equal value for the purposes of our present study.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Reptiles._\r\n\r\nThese hold a somewhat intermediate place, as regards their distribution,\r\nbetween mammals and birds, having on the whole rather a wider range than\r\nthe former, and a more restricted one than the latter.\r\n\r\nSnakes appear to have hardly more facilities for crossing the ocean than\r\nmammals; hence they are generally absent from oceanic islands. They are\r\nmore especially a tropical group, and have thus never been able to pass\r\nfrom one continent to another by those high northern and southern routes,\r\nwhich we have seen reason to believe were very effectual in the case of\r\nmammalia and some other animals. Hence we find no resemblance between the\r\nAustralian and Neotropical regions, or between the Palæarctic and Nearctic;\r\nwhile the Western Hemisphere is comparatively poor as regards variety of\r\ntypes, although rich in genera and species. Deserts and high mountains are\r\nalso very effectual barriers for this group, and their lines of migration\r\nhave probably been along river valleys, and occasionally across narrow seas\r\nby means of floating vegetation.\r\n\r\nLizards, being somewhat less tropical than snakes, may have passed by the\r\nnorthern route during warm epochs. They are also more suited to traverse\r\ndeserts, and they possess some unknown {548}means of crossing the ocean, as\r\nthey are not unfrequently found in remote oceanic islands. These various\r\ncauses have modified their distribution. The Western Hemisphere is much\r\nricher in lizards than it is in snakes; and it is also very distinct from\r\nthe Eastern Hemisphere. The lines of migration of lizards appear to have\r\nbeen along the mountains and deserts of tropical countries, and, under\r\nspecial conditions, across tropical seas from island to island.\r\n\r\nCrocodiles are a declining group. They were once more generally\r\ndistributed, all the three families being found in British Eocene deposits.\r\nBeing aquatic and capable of living in the sea, they can readily pass along\r\nall the coasts and islands of the warmer parts of the globe. Tortoises are\r\nequally ancient, and the restriction of certain groups to definite areas\r\nseems to be also a recent phenomenon.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Amphibia._\r\n\r\nThe Amphibia differ widely from Reptiles in their power of enduring cold;\r\none of their chief divisions, the Urodela or Tailed-Batrachia, being\r\nconfined to the temperate parts of the Northern Hemisphere. To this class\r\nof animals the northern and southern routes of migration were open; and we\r\naccordingly find a considerable amount of resemblance between South America\r\nand Australia, and a still stronger affinity between North America and the\r\nPalæarctic continent. The other tropical regions are more distinct from\r\neach other; clearly indicating that, in this group, it is tropical deserts\r\nand tropical oceans which are the barriers to migration. The class however\r\nis very fragmentary, and probably very ancient; so that descendants of once\r\nwidespread types are now found isolated in various parts of the globe,\r\nbetween which we may feel sure there has been no direct transmission of\r\nBatrachia. Remembering that their chief lines of migration have been by\r\nnorthern and southern land-routes, by floating ice, by fresh-water\r\nchannels, and perhaps at rare intervals by ova being carried by aquatic\r\nbirds or by violent storms,--we shall be able to comprehend most of the\r\nfeatures of their actual distribution.\r\n\r\n\r\n{549}_Fresh-water Fishes._\r\n\r\nAlthough it would appear, at first sight, that the means of dispersal of\r\nthese animals are very limited, yet they share to some extent the wide\r\nrange of other fresh-water organisms. They are found in all climates; but\r\nthe tropical regions are by far the most productive, and of these South\r\nAmerica is perhaps the richest and most peculiar. There is a certain amount\r\nof identity between the two northern continents, and also between those of\r\nthe South Temperate zone; yet all are radically distinct, even North\r\nAmerica and Europe having but a small proportion of their forms in common.\r\nThe occurrence of allied fresh-water species in remote lands--as the\r\n_Aphritis_ of Tasmania and Patagonia, and the _Comephorus_ of Lake Baikal,\r\ndistantly allied to the mackerels of Northern seas--would imply that marine\r\nfishes are often modified for a life in fresh waters; while other facts no\r\nless plainly show that permanent fresh-water species are sometimes\r\ndispersed in various ways across the oceans, more especially by the\r\nnorthern and southern routes.\r\n\r\nThe families of fresh-water fishes are often of restricted range, although\r\ncases of very wide and scattered distribution also occur. The great\r\nzoological regions are, on the whole, very well characterized; showing that\r\nthe same barriers are effectual here, as with most other vertebrates. We\r\nconclude, therefore, that the chief lines of migration of fresh-water\r\nfishes have been across the Arctic and Antarctic seas, probably by means of\r\nfloating ice as well as by the help of the vast flocks of migratory aquatic\r\nbirds that frequent those regions. On continents they are, usually, widely\r\ndispersed; but tropical seas, even when of small extent, appear to have\r\noffered an effectual barrier to their dispersal. The cases of affinity\r\nbetween Tropical America, Africa, Asia, and Australia, must therefore be\r\nimputed either to the survival of once widespread groups, or to analogous\r\nadaptation to a fresh-water life of wide-spread marine types; and these\r\ncases cannot be taken as evidence of any former land connection between\r\nsuch remote continents.\r\n\r\n\r\n{550}_Insects._\r\n\r\nIt has already been shown (Vol. I. pp. 209-213 and Vol. II. pp. 44-48) that\r\nthe peculiarities of distribution of the various groups of insects depend\r\nvery much on their habits and general economy. Their antiquity is so vast,\r\nand their more important modifications of structure have probably occurred\r\nso slowly, that modes of dispersal depending on such a combination of\r\nfavourable conditions as to be of excessive rarity, may yet have had time\r\nto produce large cumulative effects. Their small specific gravity and their\r\nhabits of flight render them liable to dispersal by winds to an extent\r\nunknown in other classes of animals; and thus, what are usually very\r\neffectual barriers have been overstepped, and sometimes almost obliterated,\r\nin the case of insects. A careful examination will, however, almost always\r\nshow traces of an ancient fauna, agreeing in character with other classes\r\nof animals, intermixed with the more prominent and often more numerous\r\nforms whose presence is due to this unusual facility of dispersal.\r\n\r\nThe effectual migration of insects is, perhaps more than in any other class\r\nof animals, limited by organic and physical conditions. The vegetation, the\r\nsoil, the temperature, and the supply of moisture, must all be suited to\r\ntheir habits and economy; while they require an immunity from enemies of\r\nvarious kinds, which immigrants to a new country seldom obtain. Few\r\norganisms have, in so many complex ways, become adapted to their special\r\nenvironment, as have insects. They are in each country more or less adapted\r\nto the plants which belong to it; while their colours, their habits, and\r\nthe very nature of the juices of their system, are all modified so as to\r\nprotect them from the special dangers which surround them in their native\r\nland. It follows, that while no animals are so well adapted to show us the\r\nvarious modes by which dispersal may be effected, none can so effectually\r\nteach us the true nature and vast influence of the organic barrier in\r\nlimiting dispersal.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that insects have at one time or another taken advantage of\r\nevery line of migration by which any terrestrial {551}organisms have spread\r\nover the earth, but owing to their small size and rapid multiplication,\r\nthey have made use of some which are exclusively their own. Such are the\r\npassage along mountain ranges from the Arctic to the Antarctic regions, and\r\nthe dispersal of certain types over all temperate lands. It will perhaps be\r\nfound that insects have spread over the land surface in directions\r\ndependent on our surface zones--forests, pastures, and deserts;--and a\r\nstudy of these, with a due consideration of the fact that narrow seas are\r\nscarcely a barrier to most of the groups, may assist us to understand many\r\nof the details of insect-distribution.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Terrestrial Mollusca._\r\n\r\nThe distribution of land-shells agrees, in some features, with that of\r\ninsects, while in others the two are strongly contrasted. In both we see\r\nthe effects of great antiquity, with some special means of dispersal; but\r\nwhile in insects the general powers of motion, both voluntary and\r\ninvoluntary, are at a maximum, in land-molluscs they are almost at a\r\nminimum. Although to some extent dependent on vegetation and climate, the\r\nlatter are more dependent on inorganic conditions, and also to a large\r\nextent on the general organic environment. The result of these various\r\ncauses, acting through countless ages, has been to spread the main types of\r\nstructure with considerable uniformity over the globe; while generic and\r\nsub-generic forms are often wonderfully localized.\r\n\r\nLand-shells, even more than insects, seem, at first sight, to require\r\nregions of their own; but we have already pointed out the disadvantages of\r\nsuch a method of study. It will be far more instructive to refer them to\r\nthose regions and sub-regions which are found to accord best with the\r\ndistribution of the higher animals, and to consider the various anomalies\r\nthey present as so many problems, to be solved by a careful study of their\r\nhabits and economy, and especially by a search after the hidden causes\r\nwhich have enabled them to spread so widely over land and ocean.\r\n\r\nThe lines of migration which land-shells have followed, can {552}hardly be\r\ndetermined with any definiteness. On continents they seem to spread\r\nsteadily, but slowly, in every direction, checked probably by organic and\r\nphysical conditions rather than by the barriers which limit the higher\r\ngroups. Over the ocean they are also slowly dispersed, by some means which\r\nact perhaps at very long intervals, but which, within the period of the\r\nduration of genera and families, are tolerably effective. It thus happens\r\nthat, although the powers of dispersal of land-shells and insects are so\r\nvery unequal, the resulting geographical distribution is almost the\r\nopposite of what might have been expected,--the former being, on the whole,\r\nless distinctly localized than the latter.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION.\r\n\r\nThe preceding remarks are all I now venture to offer, on the distinguishing\r\nfeatures of the various groups of land-animals as regards their\r\ndistribution and migrations. They are at best but indications of the\r\nvarious lines of research opened up to us by the study of animals from the\r\ngeographical point of view, and by looking upon their range in space and\r\ntime as an important portion of the earth's history. Much work has yet to\r\nbe done before the materials will exist for a complete treatment of the\r\nsubject in all its branches; and it is the author's hope that his volumes\r\nmay lead to a more systematic collection and arrangement of the necessary\r\nfacts. At present all public museums and private collections are arranged\r\nzoologically. All treatises, monographs, and catalogues, also follow, more\r\nor less completely, the zoological arrangement; and the greatest difficulty\r\nthe student of geographical distribution has to contend against, is the\r\ntotal absence of geographical collections, and the almost total want of\r\ncomplete and comparable local catalogues. Till every well-marked\r\ndistrict,--every archipelago, and every important island, has all its known\r\nspecies of the more important groups of animals catalogued on a uniform\r\nplan, and with a uniform nomenclature, a thoroughly satisfactory account of\r\nthe Geographical Distribution of Animals will not be possible. But more\r\nthan this is wanted. Many of the most curious relations between animal\r\n{553}forms and their habitats, are entirely unnoticed, owing to the\r\nproductions of the same locality _never_ being associated in our museums\r\nand collections. A few such relations have been brought to light by modern\r\nscientific travellers, but many more remain to be discovered; and there is\r\nprobably no fresher and more productive field still unexplored in Natural\r\nHistory. Most of these curious and suggestive relations are to be found in\r\nthe productions of islands, as compared with each other, or with the\r\ncontinents of which they form appendages; but these can never be properly\r\nstudied, or even discovered, unless they are visibly grouped together. When\r\nthe birds, the more conspicuous families of insects, and the land-shells of\r\nislands, are kept together so as to be readily compared with similar\r\nassociations from the adjacent continents or other islands, it is believed\r\nthat in almost every case there will be found to be peculiarities of form\r\nor colour running through widely different groups, and strictly indicative\r\nof local or geographical influences. Some of these coincident variations\r\nhave been alluded to in various parts of this work, but they have never\r\nbeen systematically investigated. They constitute an unworked mine of\r\nwealth for the enterprising explorer; and they may not improbably lead to\r\nthe discovery of some of the hidden laws (supplementary to Natural\r\nSelection), which seem to be required, in order to account for many of the\r\nexternal characteristics of animals.\r\n\r\nIn concluding his task, the author ventures to suggest, that naturalists\r\nwho are disposed to turn aside from the beaten track of research, may find\r\nin the line of study here suggested a new and interesting pursuit, not\r\ninferior in attractions to the lofty heights of transcendental anatomy, or\r\nthe bewildering mazes of modern classification. And it is a study which\r\nwill surely lead them to an increased appreciation of the beauty and the\r\nharmony of nature, and to a fuller comprehension of the complex relations\r\nand mutual interdependence, which link together every animal and vegetable\r\nform, with the ever-changing earth which supports them, into one grand\r\norganic whole.\r\n\r\n\r\n{557}GENERAL INDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll names in Italics refer, either to the genera and other groups of\r\nExtinct Animals in Part II. of the First Volume;--or to the genera whose\r\ndistribution is given under Geographical Zoology (Part IV.) in the Second\r\nVolume; the Families and higher groups being in small capitals.

CLAY, SONS, AND TAYLOR, PRINTERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes\r\n\r\n[1] Messrs. Sclater and Salvin, and Professor Newton, divide the\r\n    Neotropical Region into six sub-regions, of which our \"Brazilian\r\n    sub-region\" comprises three--the \"Brazilian,\" the \"Amazonian,\" and the\r\n    \"Columbian;\" but, after due consideration, it does not seem advisable\r\n    to adopt this subdivision in a general work which treats of all the\r\n    classes of terrestrial animals. (See p. 27.)\r\n\r\n[2] Mr. Salvin, who has critically examined the ornithological fauna of\r\n    these islands, has kindly corrected my MS. List of the Birds, his\r\n    valuable paper in the _Transactions of the Zoological Society_ not\r\n    having been published in time for me to make use of it.\r\n\r\n[3] This name will be used for the whole island of St. Domingo, as being\r\n    both shorter and more euphonious, and avoiding all confusion with\r\n    Dominica, one of the Lesser Antilles. It is also better known than\r\n    \"Hispaniola,\" which is perhaps the most correct name.\r\n\r\n[4] Myospalax has hitherto formed part of the next family, Spalacidæ; but a\r\n    recent examination of its anatomy by M. Milne-Edwards shows that it\r\n    belongs to the Muridæ, and comes near Arvicola.\r\n\r\n[5] The species of the genera _Phylloscopus_ and _Hypolais_ are so mixed up\r\n    in the _Hand List_, that Mr. Tristram has furnished me with the\r\n    following enumeration of the species which in his view properly belong\r\n    to them, by the numbers in that work:--\r\n\r\n      _Phylloscopus._\r\n      3032\r\n      3033\r\n      3048 = 3038\r\n      3039\r\n      3063 = 3047 = 3054 = 3061\r\n      3048\r\n      3049\r\n      3050\r\n      3051\r\n      3052\r\n      3053\r\n      3056 = 3081\r\n      3057\r\n      3059\r\n      3060\r\n\r\n      _Hypolais._\r\n      3026\r\n      3028\r\n      3029\r\n      3054 = 3031 = 3036\r\n      3042\r\n      3043\r\n      304\r\n      3062 = 3047\r\n      3046 = 2932\r\n      3035\r\n      2976\r\n\r\n[6] The term \"Malaya\" is used here to include the Malay Peninsula, Sumatra,\r\n    Borneo, and Java, a district to which many species and genera are\r\n    confined. \"Malay Archipelago\" will be used to include both Indo-Malaya\r\n    and Austro-Malaya.",
