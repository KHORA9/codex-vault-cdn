INTRODUCTORY.\r\n\r\nMENDEL'S LAW OF SEGREGATION.\r\n\r\nAlthough the ratio of 3 to 1 in which contrasted characters reappear in the\r\nsecond or F_2 generation is sometimes referred to as Mendel's Law of\r\nHeredity, the really significant discovery of Mendel was not the 3 to 1\r\nratio, but the segregation of the characters (or rather, of the germinal\r\nrepresentatives of the characters) which is the underlying cause of the\r\nappearance of the ratio. Mendel saw that the characters with which he\r\nworked must be represented in the germ-cells by specific producers (which\r\nwe may call factors), and that in the fertilization of an individual\r\nshowing one member of a pair of contrasting characters by an individual\r\nshowing the other member, the factors for the two characters meet in the\r\nhybrid, and that _when the hybrid forms germ-cells the factors segregate\r\nfrom each other without having been contaminated one by the other._ In\r\nconsequence, half the germ-cells contain one member of the pair and the\r\nother half the other member. When two such hybrid individuals are bred\r\ntogether the combinations of the pure germ-cells give three classes of\r\noffspring, namely, two hybrids to one of each of the pure forms. Since the\r\nhybrids usually can not be distinguished from one of the pure forms, the\r\nobserved ratio is 3 of one kind (the dominant) to 1 of the other kind (the\r\nrecessive).\r\n\r\nThere is another discovery that is generally included as a part of Mendel's\r\nLaw. We may refer to this as the _assortment_ in the germ-cells of the\r\nproducts of the segregation of two or more pairs of factors. If assortment\r\ntakes place according to chance, then definite F_2 ratios result, such as\r\n9:3:3:1 (for two pairs) and 27:9:9:9:3:3:3:1 (for three pairs), etc. Mendel\r\nobtained such ratios in peas, and until quite recently it has been\r\ngenerally supposed that free assortment is the rule when several pairs of\r\ncharacters are involved. But, as we shall try to show, the emphasis that\r\nhas been laid on these ratios has obscured the really important part of\r\nMendel's discovery, namely, _segregation_; for with the discovery in 1906\r\nof the fact of linkage the ratios based on free assortment were seen to\r\nhold only for combinations of certain pairs of characters, not for other\r\ncombinations. But the principle of segregation still holds for each pair of\r\ncharacters. Hence segregation remains the cardinal point of Mendelism.\r\nSegregation is to-day Mendel's Law.\r\n\r\nLINKAGE AND CHROMOSOMES.\r\n\r\nIt has been found that when _certain_ characters enter a cross together\r\n(_i. e._, from the same parent) their factors tend to pass into the same\r\ngamete of the hybrid, with the result that other ratios than the chance\r\nratios described by Mendel are found in the F_2 generation. {6} Such cases\r\nof linkage have been described in several forms, but nowhere on so\r\nextensive a scale as in the pomace fly, _Drosophila ampelophila_. Here,\r\nover a hundred characters that have been investigated as to their linkage\r\nrelations are found to fall into four groups, the members of each group\r\nbeing linked, in the sense that they tend to be transmitted to the gametes\r\nin the same combinations in which they entered from the parents. The\r\nmembers of each group give free assortment with the members of any of the\r\nother three groups. A most significant fact in regard to the linkage shown\r\nby the _Drosophila_ mutants is that _the number of linked groups\r\ncorresponds to the number of pairs of the chromosomes._ If the gens for the\r\nMendelian characters are carried by the chromosomes we should expect to\r\nfind demonstrated in _Drosophila_ that there are as many groups of\r\ncharacters that are inherited together as there are pairs of chromosomes,\r\nprovided the chromosomes retain their individuality. The evidence that the\r\nchromosomes are structural elements of the cell that perpetuate themselves\r\nat every division has continually grown stronger. That factors have the\r\nsame distribution as the chromosomes is clearly seen in the case of\r\nsex-linked characters, where it can be shown that any character of this\r\ntype appears in those individuals which from the known distribution of the\r\nX chromosomes must also contain the chromosome in question. For example, in\r\n_Drosophila_, as in many other insects, there are two X chromosomes in the\r\ncells of the female and one X chromosome in the cells of the male. There is\r\nin the male, in addition to the X, also a Y chromosome, which acts as its\r\nmate in synapsis and reduction. After reduction each egg carries an X\r\nchromosome. In the male there are two classes of sperm, one carrying the X\r\nchromosome and the other carrying the Y chromosome. Any egg fertilized by\r\nan X sperm produces a female; any egg fertilized by a Y sperm produces a\r\nmale. The scheme of inheritance is as follows.\r\n\r\n            +------------------------------+\r\n            |                              |\r\n            | Eggs                    X--X |\r\n            | Sperm                   X--Y |\r\n            +------------------------------+\r\n            | Daughter                 XX  |\r\n            | Son                      XY  |\r\n            |                              |\r\n            +------------------------------+\r\n\r\nThe sons get their single X chromosome from their mother, and should\r\ntherefore show any character whose gen is carried by such a chromosome. In\r\nsex-linked inheritance all sons show the characters of their mother. A male\r\ntransmits his sex-linked character to his daughters, who show it if\r\ndominant and conceal it if recessive. But any daughter will transmit such a\r\ncharacter, whether dominant or recessive, to half of her sons. The path of\r\ntransmission of the gen is the same as the path followed by the X\r\nchromosome, received here {7} from the male. Many other combinations show\r\nthe same relations. In the case of non-disjunction, to be given later,\r\nthere is direct experimental evidence of such a nature that there can no\r\nlonger be any doubt that the X chromosomes are the carriers of certain gens\r\nthat we speak of as sex-linked. This term (sex-linked) is intended to mean\r\nthat such characters are carried by the X chromosome. It has been objected\r\nthat this use of the term implies a knowledge of a factor for sex in the X\r\nchromosome to which the other factors in that chromosome are linked; but in\r\nfact we have as much knowledge in regard to the occurrence of a sex factor\r\nor sex factors in the X chromosome as we have for other factors. It is true\r\nwe do not know whether there is more than one sex-factor, because there is\r\nno crossing-over in the male (the heterozygous sex), and crossing-over in\r\nthe female does not influence the distribution of sex, since like parts are\r\nsimply interchanged. It follows from this that we are unable as yet to\r\nlocate the sex factor or factors in the X chromosome. The fact that we can\r\nnot detect crossing-over under this condition is not an argument against\r\nthe occurrence of linkage. We are justified, therefore, in speaking of the\r\nfactors carried by the X chromosome as sex-linked.\r\n\r\nCROSSING-OVER.\r\n\r\nWhen two or more sex-linked factors are present in a male they are always\r\ntransmitted together to his daughters, as must necessarily be the case if\r\nthey are carried by the unpaired X chromosome. If such a male carrying, let\r\nus say, two sex-linked factors, is mated to a wild female, his daughters\r\nwill have one X chromosome containing the factors for both characters,\r\nderived from the father, and another X chromosome that contains the factors\r\nthat are normal for these two factors (the normal allelomorphs). The sons\r\nof such a female will get one or the other of these two kinds of\r\nchromosomes, and should be expected to be like the one or the other\r\ngrandparent. In fact, most of the sons are of these two kinds. But, in\r\naddition, there are sons that show one only of the two original mutant\r\ncharacters. Clearly an interchange has taken place between the two X\r\nchromosomes in the female in such a way that a piece of one chromosome has\r\nbeen exchanged for the homologous piece of the other. The same conclusion\r\nis reached if the cross is made in such a way that the same two sex-linked\r\ncharacters enter, but, one from the mother and the other from the father.\r\nThe daughter gets one of her sex chromosomes from her mother and the other\r\nfrom her father. She should produce, then, two kinds of sons, one like her\r\nmother and one like her father. In fact, the majority of her sons are of\r\nthese two kinds, but, in addition, there are two other kinds of sons, one\r\nkind showing both mutant characters, the other kind showing normal\r\ncharacters. Here again the results must be due to interchange between the\r\ntwo X's in the hybrid female. _The number of_ {8} _the sons due to exchange\r\nin the two foregoing crosses is always the same, although they are of\r\ncontrary classes._ Clearly, then, the interchange takes place irrespective\r\nof the way in which the factors enter the cross. We call those classes that\r\narise through interchange between the chromosomes \"cross-over classes\" or\r\nmerely \"cross-overs.\" The phenomenon of holding together we speak of as\r\nlinkage.\r\n\r\nBy taking a number of factors into consideration at the same time it has\r\nbeen shown that _crossing-over involves large pieces of the chromosomes_.\r\nThe X chromosomes undergo crossing-over in about 60 per cent of the cases,\r\nand the crossing-over may occur at any point along the chromosome. When it\r\noccurs once, whole ends (or halves even) go over together and the exchange\r\nis always equivalent. If crossing-over occurs twice at the same time a\r\nmiddle piece of one chromosome is intercalated between the ends of the\r\nother chromosome. This process is called double crossing-over. It occurs\r\nnot oftener than in about 10 per cent of cases for the total length of the\r\nX chromosome. Triple crossing-over in the X chromosome is extremely rare\r\nand has been observed only about a half dozen times.\r\n\r\nWhile the genetic evidence forces one to accept crossing-over between the\r\nsex chromosomes in the female, that evidence gives no clue as to how such a\r\nprocess is brought about. There are, however, certain facts familiar to the\r\ncytologist that furnish a clue as to how such an interchange might take\r\nplace. When the homologous chromosomes come together at synapsis it has\r\nbeen demonstrated, in some forms at least, that they twist about each other\r\nso that one chromosome comes to lie now on the one side now on the other of\r\nits partner. If at some points the chromosomes break and the pieces on the\r\nsame side unite and pass to the same pole of the karyokinetic spindle, the\r\nnecessary condition for crossing-over will have been fulfilled.\r\n\r\nTHE Y CHROMOSOME AND NON-DISJUNCTION.\r\n\r\nFollowing Wilson's nomenclature, we speak of both X and Y as sex\r\nchromosomes. Both the cytological and the genetic evidence shows that when\r\ntwo X chromosomes are present a female is produced, when one, a male. This\r\nconclusion leaves the Y chromosome without any observed relation to\r\nsex-determination, despite the fact that the Y is normally present in every\r\nmale and is confined to the male line. The question may be asked, and in\r\nfact has been asked, why may not the presence of the Y chromosome determine\r\nthat a male develop and its absence that a female appear? The only answer\r\nthat has yet been given, outside of the work on _Drosophila_, is that since\r\nin some insects there is no Y chromosome, there is no need to make such an\r\nassumption. But in _Drosophila_ direct proof that Y has no such function is\r\nfurnished by the evidence discovered by Bridges in the case of\r\nnon-disjunction. (Bridges, 1913, 1914, 1916, and unpublished results.) {9}\r\n\r\nOrdinarily all the sons and none of the daughters show the recessive\r\nsex-linked characters of the mother when the father carries the dominant\r\nallelomorph. The peculiarity of non-disjunction is that sometimes a female\r\nproduces a daughter like herself or a son like the father, although the\r\nrest of the offspring are perfectly regular. For example, a vermilion\r\nfemale mated to a wild male produces vermilion sons and wild-type\r\ndaughters, but rarely also a vermilion daughter or a wild-type son. The\r\nproduction of these exceptions (primary exceptions) by a normal XX female\r\nmust be due to an aberrant reduction division at which the two X\r\nchromosomes fail to disjoin from each other. In consequence both remain in\r\nthe egg or both pass into the polar body. In the latter case an egg without\r\nan X chromosome is produced. Such an egg fertilized by an X sperm produces\r\na male with the constitution XO. These males received their single X from\r\ntheir father and therefore show the father's characters. While these XO\r\nmales are exceptions to sex-linked inheritance, the characters that they do\r\nshow are perfectly normal, that is, the miniature or the bar or other\r\nsex-linked characters that the XO male has are like those of an XY male,\r\nshowing that the Y normally has no effect upon the development of these\r\ncharacters. But that the Y does play some positive role is proved by the\r\nfact that all the XO males have been found to be absolutely sterile.\r\n\r\nWhile the presence of the Y is necessary for the fertility of the male, it\r\nhas no effect upon sex itself. This is shown even more strikingly by the\r\nphenomenon known as secondary non-disjunction. If the two X chromosomes\r\nthat fail to disjoin remain in the egg, and this egg is fertilized by a Y\r\nsperm, an XXY individual results. This is a female which is like her mother\r\nin all sex-linked characters (a matroclinous exception), since she received\r\nboth her X chromosomes from her mother and none from her father. As far as\r\nsex is concerned this is a perfectly normal female. The extra Y has no\r\neffect upon the appearance of the characters, even in the case of eosin,\r\nwhere the female is much darker than the male. The only effect which the\r\nextra Y has is as an extra wheel in the machinery of synapsis and\r\nreduction; for, on account of the presence of the Y, both X's of the XXY\r\nfemale are sometimes left within the ripe egg, a process called secondary\r\nnon-disjunction. In consequence, an XXY female regularly produces\r\nexceptions (to the extent of about 4 per cent). A small percentage of\r\nreductions are of this XX-Y type; the majority are X-XY. The XY eggs,\r\nproduced by the X-XY reductions, when fertilized by Y sperm, give XYY\r\nmales, which show no influence of the extra Y except at synapsis and\r\nreduction. By mating an XXY female to an XYY male, XXYY females have been\r\nproduced and these are perfectly normal in appearance. We may conclude from\r\nthe fact that visibly indistinguishable males have been produced with the\r\nformulas XO, XY, and XYY, and {10} likewise females with the formulas XX,\r\nXXY, and XXYY, that the Y is without effect either on the sex or on the\r\nvisible characters (other than fertility) of the individual.\r\n\r\nThe evidence is equally positive that sex is quantitatively determined by\r\nthe X chromosome--that two X's determine a female and one a male. For in\r\nthe case of non-disjunction, a zero or a Y egg fertilized by an X sperm\r\nproduces a male, while conversely an XX egg fertilized by a Y sperm\r\nproduces a female. It is thus impossible to assume that the X sperms are\r\nnormally female-producing because of something else than the X or that the\r\nY sperm produce males for any other reason than that they normally\r\nfertilize X eggs. Both the X and the Y sperm have been shown to produce the\r\nsex opposite to that which they normally produce when they fertilize eggs\r\nthat are normal in every respect, except that of their X chromosome\r\ncontent. These facts establish experimentally that sex is determined by the\r\ncombinations of the X chromosomes, and that the male and female\r\ncombinations are the causes of sex differentiation and are not simply the\r\nresults of maleness and femaleness already determined by some other agent.\r\n\r\nCytological examination has demonstrated the existence of one XXYY female,\r\nand has checked up the occurrence in the proper classes and proportions of\r\nthe XXY females. Numerous and extensive breeding-tests have been made upon\r\nthe other points discussed. The evidence leaves no escape from the\r\nconclusion that the genetic exceptions are produced as a consequence of the\r\nexceptional distribution of the X chromosomes and that the gens for the\r\nsex-linked characters are carried by those chromosomes.\r\n\r\nMUTATION IN DROSOPHILA AMPELOPHILA.\r\n\r\nThe first mutants were found in the spring of 1910. Since then an\r\never-increasing series of new types has been appearing. An immense number\r\nof flies have come under the scrutiny of those who are working in the\r\nZoological Laboratory of Columbia University, and the discovery of so many\r\nmutant types is undoubtedly due to this fact. But that mutation is more\r\nfrequent in _Drosophila ampelophila_ than in some of the other species of\r\n_Drosophila_ seems not improbable from an extensive examination of other\r\ntypes. It is true a few mutants have been found in other _Drosophilas_, but\r\nrelatively few as compared with the number in _D. ampelophila_. Whether\r\n_ampelophila_ is more prone to mutate, or whether the conditions under\r\nwhich it is kept are such as to favor this process, we have no knowledge.\r\nSeveral attempts that we have made to produce mutations have led to no\r\nconclusive results.\r\n\r\nThe mutants of _Drosophila_ have been referred to by Baur as \"mutations\r\nthrough loss,\" but inasmuch as they differ in no respect that we can\r\ndiscover from other mutants in domesticated animals and plants, there is no\r\nparticular reason for putting them into this category unless {11} to imply\r\nthat new characters have not appeared, or that those that have appeared\r\nmust be due to loss in the sense of absence of something from the\r\ngerm-plasm.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the first point, several of the mutants are characterized by\r\nwhat seem to be additions. For example, the eye-color sepia is darker than\r\nthe ordinary red. At least three new markings have been added to the\r\nthorax. A speck has appeared at the base of the wing, etc. These are\r\nrecessive characters, it is true, but the character \"streak,\" which\r\nconsists of a dark band added to the thorax, is a dominant. If dominance is\r\nsupposed to be a criterion as to \"presence,\" then it should be pointed out\r\nthat among the mutants of _Drosophila_ a number of dominant types occur.\r\nBut clearly we are not justified by these criteria in inferring anything\r\nwhatever in regard to the nature of the change that takes place in the\r\ngerm-plasm. Probably the only data which give a basis for attempting to\r\ndecide the nature of the change in the germ-plasm are from cases where\r\nmultiple allelomorphs are found. Several such cases are known to us, and\r\ntwo of these are found in the X chromosome group, namely, a quadruple\r\nsystem (white, eosin, cherry, red), and a triple system (yellow, spot,\r\ngray). In such cases each member acts as the allelomorph of any other\r\nmember, and only two can occur in any one female, and only one in any male.\r\nIf the normal allelomorph is thought of as the positive character, which\r\none of the mutants is due to its loss or to its absence? If each is\r\nproduced by a loss it must be a different loss that acts as an allelomorph\r\nto the other loss. This is obviously absurd unless a different idea from\r\nthe one usually promulgated in regard to \"absence\" is held.\r\n\r\nMULTIPLE ALLELOMORPHS.\r\n\r\nIt appears that Cuenot was the first to find a case (in mice) in which the\r\nresults could be explained on the basis that more than two factors may\r\nstand in the relation of allelomorphs to each other. In other words, a\r\ngiven factor may become the partner of more than one other factor,\r\nalthough, in any one individual, no more than two factors stand in this\r\nrelation. While it appears that his evidence as published was not\r\ndemonstrative, and that, at the time he wrote, the possibility of such\r\nresults being due to very close linkage could not have been appreciated as\r\nan alternative explanation, nevertheless it remains that Cuenot was right\r\nin his interpretation of his results and that the factors for yellow, gray,\r\ngray white-belly, and black in mice form a system of quadruple\r\nallelomorphs.\r\n\r\nThere are at least two such systems among the factors in the first\r\nchromosome in _Drosophila_. The first of these includes the factor for\r\nwhite eyes, that for eosin eyes, and that for cherry eyes, and of course\r\nthat allelomorph of these factors present in the wild fly and which when\r\npresent gives the red color. In this instance the normal {12} allelomorph\r\ndominates all the other three, but in mice the mutant factor for yellow\r\ndominates the wild or \"normal\" allelomorph.\r\n\r\nThe other system of multiple allelomorphs in the first chromosome is a\r\ntriple system made up of yellow (body-color), spot (on abdomen), and their\r\nnormal allelomorph--the factor in the normal fly that stands for \"gray.\"\r\n\r\nIn general it may be said that there are two principal ways in which it is\r\npossible to show that certain factors (more than two) are the allelomorphs\r\nof each other. First, if they are allelomorphs only two can exist in the\r\nsame individual; and, in the case of sex-linked characters, while two may\r\nexist in the same female, only one can exist in the male, for he contains\r\nbut one X chromosome. Second, all the allelomorphs should give the same\r\npercentages of crossing-over with each other factor in the same chromosome.\r\n\r\nIt is a question of considerable theoretical importance whether these cases\r\nof multiple allelomorphs are only extreme cases of linkage or whether they\r\nform a system quite apart from linkage and in relation to normal\r\nallelomorphism. It may be worth while, therefore, to discuss this question\r\nmore at length, especially because _Drosophila_ is one of the best cases\r\nknown for such a discussion.\r\n\r\nThe factors in the first chromosome are linked to each other in various\r\ndegrees. When they are as closely linked as yellow body-color and white\r\neyes crossing-over takes place only once in a hundred times. If two factors\r\nwere still nearer together it is thinkable that crossing-over might be such\r\na rare occurrence that it would require an enormous number of individuals\r\nto demonstrate its occurrence. In such a case the factors might be said to\r\nbe completely linked, yet each would be supposed to have its normal\r\nallelomorph in the homologous chromosome of the wild type. Imagine, then, a\r\nsituation in which one of these two mutant factors (a) enters from one\r\nparent and the other mutant factor (b) from the other parent. The normal\r\nallelomorph of a may be called A. It enters the combination with b, while\r\nthe normal allelomorph B of b enters the combination with a. Since b is\r\ncompletely linked to A and a to B, the result will be the same as though a\r\nand b were the allelomorphs of each other, for in the germ-cells of the\r\nhybrid aBAb the assortment will be into aB and Ab, which is the same as\r\nthough a and b acted as segregating allelomorphs.\r\n\r\nThere is no way from Mendelian data by which this difference between a true\r\ncase of multiple allelomorphs and one of complete linkage (as just\r\nillustrated) can be determined. There is, however, a different line of\r\nattack which, in a case like that of _Drosophila_, will give an answer to\r\nthis question. The answer is found in the way in which the mutant factors\r\narise. This argument has been fully developed in the book entitled \"The\r\nMechanism of Mendelian Inheritance,\" and will therefore not be repeated\r\nhere. It must suffice to say that if two mutant {13} types that behave as\r\nallelomorphs of each other arise separately from the wild form, one of them\r\nmust have arisen as a double mutation of two factors so close to each other\r\nas to be completely linked--a highly improbable occurrence when the\r\ninfrequency of mutations is taken into consideration.[1] The evidence\r\nopposed to such an interpretation is now so strong that there can be little\r\ndoubt that multiple allelomorphs have actually appeared.\r\n\r\nOn _a priori_ grounds there is no reason why several mutative changes might\r\nnot take place in the same locus of a chromosome. If we think of a\r\nchromosome as made up of a chain of chemical particles, there may be a\r\nnumber of possible recombinations or rearrangements within each particle.\r\nAny change might make a difference in the end-product of the activity of\r\nthe cell, and give rise to a new mutant type. It is only when one\r\narbitrarily supposes that the only possible change in a factor is its loss\r\nthat any serious difficulty arises in the interpretation of multiple\r\nallelomorphs.\r\n\r\nOne of the most striking facts connected with the subject of multiple\r\nallelomorphs is that the same kind of change is effected in the same organ.\r\nThus, in the quadruple system mentioned above, the color of the eye is\r\naffected. In the yellow-spot system the color of the body is involved. In\r\nmice it is the coat-color that is different in each member of the series.\r\nWhile this is undoubtedly a striking relation and one which seems to fit\r\nwell with the idea that such effects are due to mutative changes in the\r\nsame fundamental element that affects the character in question, yet on the\r\nother hand it would be dangerous to lay too much emphasis on this point,\r\nbecause any given organ may be affected by other factors in a similar\r\nmanner, and also because a factor frequently produces more than a single\r\neffect. For instance, the factor that when present gives a white eye\r\naffects also the general yellowish pigment of the body. If red-eyed and\r\nwhite-eyed flies are put for several hours into alcohol, the yellowish\r\nbody-color of the white-eyed flies is freely extracted, but not that of the\r\nred-eyed flies. In the living condition the difference between the\r\nbody-colors of the red- and of the white-eyed flies is too slight to be\r\nvisible, but after extraction in alcohol the difference is striking. There\r\nare other effects also that follow in the wake of the white factor. Now, it\r\nis quite conceivable that in some specific case one of the effects might be\r\nmore striking than the one produced in that organ more markedly affected by\r\nthe other factor of the allelomorphic series. In such a case the relation\r\nmentioned above might seemingly disappear. For this reason it is well not\r\nto insist too strongly on the idea that multiple allelomorphs affect the\r\nsame part in the same way, even although at present that appears to be the\r\nrule for all known cases.\r\n\r\n{14}\r\n\r\nSEX-LINKED LETHALS AND THE SEX RATIO.\r\n\r\nMost of the mutant types of _Drosophila_ show characteristics that may be\r\nregarded as superficial in so far as they do not prevent the animal from\r\nliving in the protected life that our cultures afford. Were they thrown\r\ninto open competition with wild forms, or, better said, were they left to\r\nshift for themselves under natural conditions, many or most of the types\r\nwould no doubt soon die out. So far as we can see, there is no reason to\r\nsuppose that the mutations which can be described as superficial are\r\ndisproportionally more likely to occur than others. Of course, superficial\r\nmutations are more likely to survive and hence to be seen; while if\r\nmutations took place in important organs some of them would be expected to\r\naffect injuriously parts essential to the life of the individual and in\r\nconsequence such an individual perishes. The \"lethal factors\" of\r\n_Drosophila_ may be supposed to be mutations of some such nature; but as\r\nyet we have not studied this side of the question sufficiently, and this\r\nsupposed method of action of the lethals is purely speculative. Whatever\r\nthe nature of the lethals' action, it can be shown that from among the\r\noffspring obtained from certain stocks expected classes are missing, and\r\nthe absence of these classes can be accounted for on the assumption that\r\nthere are present mutant factors that follow the Mendelian rule of\r\nsegregation and which show normal linkage to other factors, but whose only\r\nrecognizable difference from the normal is the death of those individuals\r\nwhich receive them. The numerical results can be handled in precisely the\r\nsame way as are other linkage results.\r\n\r\nThere are some general relations that concern the lethals that may be\r\nmentioned here, while the details are left for the special part or are\r\nfound in the special papers dealing with these lethals. A factor of this\r\nkind carried by the X chromosome would be transmitted in the female line\r\nbecause the female, having two X chromosomes, would have one of them with\r\nthe normal allelomorph (dominant) of the lethal factor carried by the other\r\nX chromosome. Half of her sons would get one of her X's, the other half the\r\nother. Those sons that get the lethal X will die, since the male having\r\nonly one X lacks the power of containing both the lethal and its normal\r\nallelomorph. The other half of the sons will survive, but will not transmit\r\nthe lethal factor. In all lethal stocks there are only half as many sons as\r\ndaughters. The heterozygous lethal-bearing female, fertilized by a normal\r\nmale, will give rise to two kinds of daughters; one normal in both X's, the\r\nother with a normal X and a lethal-bearing X chromosome. The former are\r\nalways normal in behavior, and the latter repeat in their descendants the\r\n2:1 sex-ratio.\r\n\r\nWhether a female bearing the same lethal twice (_i.e._, one homozygous for\r\na given lethal) would die, can not be stated, for no such females are\r\nobtainable, because the lethal males, which alone could bring about {15}\r\nsuch a condition, do not exist. The presumption is that a female of this\r\nkind would also die if the lethal acts injuriously on some vital function\r\nor structure.\r\n\r\nSince only half of the daughters of the lethal-bearing females carry the\r\nlethal, the stock can be maintained by breeding daughters separately in\r\neach generation to insure obtaining one which repeats the 2:1 ratio. There\r\nis, however, a much more advantageous way of carrying on the stock--one\r\nthat also confirms the sufficiency of the theory.\r\n\r\nIn carrying on a stock of a lethal, advantage can be taken of linkage. A\r\nlethal factor has a definite locus in the chromosome; if, then, a\r\nlethal-bearing female is crossed to a male of another stock with a\r\nrecessive character whose factor lies in the X chromosome very close to the\r\nlethal factor, half the daughters will have lethal in one X and the\r\nrecessive in the other. The lethal-bearing females can be picked out from\r\ntheir sisters by the fact that they give a 2:1 sex-ratio, and by the fact\r\nthat nearly all the sons that do survive show the recessive character. If\r\nsuch females are tested by breeding to the recessive males, then the\r\ndaughters which do not show the recessive carry the lethal, except in the\r\nfew cases of crossing-over. Thus in each generation the normal females are\r\ncrossed to the recessive males with the assurance that the lethal will not\r\nbe lost. If instead of the single recessive used in this fashion, a double\r\nrecessive of such a sort that one recessive lies on each side of the lethal\r\nis used, then in each generation the females which show neither recessive\r\nwill almost invariably contain the lethal, since a double cross-over is\r\nrequired to remove the lethal.\r\n\r\nIt is true that females carrying two _different_ lethals might arise and\r\nnot die, because the injurious effect of each lethal would be dominated by\r\nits allelomorph in the other X chromosome. Such females can not be obtained\r\nby combining two existing lethals, since lethal males do not survive. They\r\ncan occur only through a new lethal arising through mutation in the\r\nhomologous chromosome of a female that already carries one lethal. Rare as\r\nsuch an event must be, it has occurred in our cultures thrice. The presence\r\nof a female of this kind will be at once noticed by the fact that she\r\nproduces no sons, or very rarely one, giving in consequence extraordinary\r\nsex-ratios. The rare appearance of a son from such a female can be\r\naccounted for in the following way: If crossing-over occurs between her X\r\nchromosomes the result will be that one X will sometimes contain two\r\nlethals, the other none. The latter, if it passes into a male, will lead to\r\nthe development of a normal individual. The number of such males depends on\r\nthe distance apart of the two lethals in the chromosome. There is a crucial\r\ntest of this hypothesis of two lethals in females giving extraordinary\r\nratios. This test has been applied to the cases in which such females were\r\nfound, by Rawls (1913), by Morgan (1914_c_), and again by Stark (1915), and\r\nit has been found to confirm the explanation. The daughters of {16} such a\r\nfemale should all (excepting a rare one due to crossing-over) give 2:1\r\nratios, because each daughter must get one or the other X chromosome of her\r\nmother, that is, one or the other lethal. Although the mother was\r\nfertilized by a normal male, every daughter is heterozygous for one or the\r\nother of the lethal factors. The daughters of the two-lethal females differ\r\nfrom the daughters of the one-lethal female in that the former mother, as\r\njust stated, gives all lethal-bearing daughters; the latter transmits her\r\nlethal to only half of her daughters.\r\n\r\nINFLUENCE OF THE ENVIRONMENT ON THE REALIZATION OF TWO SEX-LINKED\r\nCHARACTERS.\r\n\r\nThe need of a special environment in order that certain mutant characters\r\nmay express themselves has been shown for abnormal abdomen (Morgan,\r\n1912_d_, 1915_b_) and for reduplication of the legs (Hoge, 1915). In a\r\nthird type, club, described here (page 69), the failure of the unfolding of\r\nthe wing which occurs in about 20 per cent of the flies is also without\r\nmuch doubt an environmental effect, but as yet the particular influence\r\nthat causes the change is unknown.\r\n\r\nA very extensive series of observations has been made on the character\r\ncalled abnormal abdomen. In pure cultures kept moist with abundance of\r\nfresh food all the flies that hatch for the first few days have the black\r\nbands of the abdomen obliterated or made faint and irregular. As the\r\nbottles get dry and the food becomes scarce the flies become more and more\r\nnormal, until at last they are indistinguishable from the normal flies.\r\nNevertheless these normal-looking flies will give rise in a suitable\r\nenvironment to the same kind of flies as the very abnormal flies first\r\nhatched. By breeding from the last flies of each culture, and in dry\r\ncultures, flies can be bred from normal ancestors for several generations,\r\nand then by making the conditions favorable for the appearance of the\r\nabnormal condition, the flies will be as abnormal as though their ancestors\r\nhad always been abnormal. Here, then, is a character that is susceptible to\r\nthe variations in the environment, yet whatever the realized condition of\r\nthe soma may be, that condition has no effect whatever on the nature of the\r\ngerm-plasm. A more striking disproof of the theory of the inheritance of\r\nacquired characters would be hard to find.\r\n\r\nA demonstration is given in this instance of the interaction between a\r\ngiven genotypic constitution and a special environment. The character\r\nabnormal is a sex-linked dominant. Therefore, if an abnormal male is mated\r\nto a wild female the daughters are heterozygous for abnormal, while the\r\nsons, getting their X chromosome from their mother, are entirely normal. In\r\na wet environment all the daughters are abnormal and the sons normal. As\r\nthe culture dries out the daughters' color becomes normal in appearance.\r\nBut while the sons {17} will never transmit abnormality to any of their\r\ndescendants in any environment, the daughters will transmit (if bred to\r\nnormal males) in a suitable environment their peculiarity to half of their\r\ndaughters and to half of their sons. The experiment shows convincingly that\r\nthe abnormal abdomen appears in a special environment only in those flies\r\nthat have a given genotypic constitution.\r\n\r\nAs the cultures dry out the abnormal males are the first to change over to\r\nnormal, then the heterozygous females, and lastly the homozygous females.\r\nIt is doubtful if any far-reaching conclusion can be drawn from this\r\nseries, because the first and second classes differ from each other not\r\nonly in the presence of one or of two factors for abnormal, but also by the\r\nabsence in the first case (male) of an entire X chromosome with its\r\ncontained factors. The second and third classes differ from each other only\r\nby the abnormal factor.\r\n\r\nSimilar results were found in the mutant type called reduplicated legs,\r\nwhich is a sex-linked recessive character that appears best when the\r\ncultures are kept at about 10deg C. As Miss M. A. Hoge has shown, this\r\ncharacter then becomes realized in nearly all of the flies that have the\r\nproper constitution, but not in flies of normal constitution placed in the\r\nsame environment. Here the effect is produced by cold.\r\n\r\nSEXUAL POLYMORPHISM.\r\n\r\nOutside the primary and secondary sexual differences between the male and\r\nthe female, there is a considerable number of species of animals with more\r\nthan one kind of female or male. Darwin and his followers have tried to\r\nexplain such cases on the grounds that more than one kind of female (or\r\nmale) might arise through natural selection, in consequence of some\r\nindividuals mimicking a protected species. It is needless to point out here\r\nhow involved and intricate such a process would be, because the mutation\r\ntheory has cut the Gordian knot and given a simpler solution of the origin\r\nof such diandromorphic and digynomorphic conditions.\r\n\r\nIn _Drosophila_ a mutant, eosin eye-color, appeared in which the female has\r\ndarker eyes than the male. If such stock is crossed with cherry (another\r\nsex-linked recessive mutant, allelomorphic to eosin) the females in the F_2\r\ngeneration are alike (for the pure eosin and the eosin-cherry compound are\r\nnot separable), but the cherry males and the eosin males are quite\r\ndifferent in appearance. Here we have a simulation, at least, of a\r\ndiandromorphic species. Such a group perpetuates itself, giving one type of\r\nfemale (inasmuch as eosin and cherry females are very closely similar) and\r\ntwo types of males, only one of which is like the females. A population of\r\nthis kind is very directly comparable to certain polymorphic types that\r\noccur in nature. In _Colias philodice_ there is one type of male, yellow,\r\nand two types of females, yellow and {18} white. In _Colias eurydice_ the\r\nmale is orange and the females are orange or white. In _Papilio turnus_ the\r\nmale is yellow and the females either yellow or black. Those cases are\r\ndirectly comparable to an eosin-cherry population, except that in\r\nLepidoptera the female is heterozygous for the sex differential, in Diptera\r\nthe male.\r\n\r\nSince in _Drosophila_ the results are explicable on a sex-linked basis, a\r\nsimilar explanation may apply to polymorphism in butterflies. By suitable\r\ncombinations of eosin and cherry most of the cases of polymorphism in\r\nbutterflies may be simulated. To simulate the more complex cases, such as\r\nthat of _Papilio polytes_ and _memnon_, another allelomorph like eosin\r\nwould have to be introduced. A population of mixed cherry and white would\r\ngive three somatic types of females (cherry, cherry-white, and white) and\r\ntwo of males (cherry and white).\r\n\r\nFERTILITY AND STERILITY IN THE MUTANTS.\r\n\r\nAside from the decrease in fertility that occurs in certain stocks (a\r\nquestion that need not be treated here), there are among the types\r\ndescribed in the text two cases that call for special comment. When the\r\nmutant type called \"rudimentary\" was first discovered, it was found that\r\nthe females were sterile but the males were fully fertile. Later work has\r\nrevealed the nature of the sterility of the female. The ovaries are present\r\nand in the young flies appear normal, but while in the normal flies the\r\neggs in the posterior portion enlarge rapidly during the first few days\r\nafter hatching, in the rudimentary females only a very few (about 15) eggs\r\nenlarge. The other eggs in the ovary remain at a lower stage of their\r\ndevelopment. Rarely the female lays a few eggs; when she does so some of\r\nthe eggs hatch, and if she has been mated to a rudimentary male, the\r\noffspring are rudimentary females and males. The rudimentary females mate\r\nin the normal time with rudimentary or with normal males, and their sexual\r\nbehavior is normal. Their sterility is therefore due to the failure of the\r\neggs to develop properly. Whether in addition to this there is some\r\nincompatibility between the sperm and the eggs of this type (as supposed to\r\nbe the case at one time) is not conclusively disproved, but is not probable\r\nfrom the evidence now available.\r\n\r\nIn the mutant called \"fused\" the females are sterile both with wild males\r\nand with males from their own stock. An examination of the ovaries of these\r\nfemales, made by Mr. C. McEwen, shows clearly that there are fewer than the\r\nnormal number of mature eggs, recalling the case of rudimentary.\r\n\r\nIt should be noticed that there is no apparent relation between the\r\nsterility of these two types and the occurrence of the mutation in the X\r\nchromosome, because other mutations in the X do not cause sterility, and\r\nthere is sterility in other mutant types that are due to factors in other\r\nchromosomes. {19}\r\n\r\nBALANCED INVIABILITY.\r\n\r\nThe determination of the cross-over values of the factors was at first\r\nhindered because of the poor viability of some of the mutants. If the\r\nviability of each mutant type could be determined in relation to the\r\nviability of the normal, \"coefficients of viability\" could serve as\r\ncorrections in working with the various mutant characters. But it was found\r\n(Bridges and Sturtevant, 1914) that viability was so erratic that\r\ncoefficients might mislead. At the same time it was becoming more apparent\r\nthat poor viability is no necessary attribute of a character, but depends\r\nvery largely on the condition of culture. Competition among larvae was\r\nfound to be the chief factor in viability. Mass cultures almost invariably\r\nhave extremely poor viability, even though an attempt is made to supply an\r\nabundance of food. Special tests (Morgan and Tice, 1914) showed that even\r\nthose mutants which were considered the very poorest in viability were\r\nproduced in proportions fairly close to the theoretical when only one\r\nfemale was used for each large culture bottle and the amount and quality of\r\nfood was carefully adjusted.\r\n\r\nFor the majority of mutants which did well even under heavy competition in\r\nmass cultures the pair-breeding method reduced the disturbances due to\r\nviability to a point where they were negligible.\r\n\r\nLater a method was devised (Bridges, 1915) whereby mutations of poor\r\nviability could be worked with in linkage experiments fairly accurately and\r\nwhereby the residual inviability of the ordinary characters could be\r\nlargely canceled. This method consists in balancing the data of a certain\r\nclass with poor viability by means of an equivalent amount of data in which\r\nthe same class occurs as the other member of the ratio. Thus in obtaining\r\ndata upon any linkage case it is best to have the total number of\r\nindividuals made up of approximately equal numbers derived from each of the\r\npossible ways in which the experiment may be conducted. In the simplest\r\ncase, in which the results are of the form AB:Ab:aB:ab, let us suppose that\r\nthe class ab has a disproportionately low viability. If, then, ab occurs in\r\nan experiment as a cross-over class, that class will be too small and a\r\nfalse linkage value will be calculated. The remedy is to balance the\r\npreceding data by an equal amount of data in which ab occurs as a\r\nnon-cross-over. In these latter the error will be the opposite of the\r\nprevious one, and by combining the two experiments the errors should be\r\nbalanced to give a better approximation to the true value. When equal\r\namounts of data, secured in these two ways, are combined, all four classes\r\nwill be balanced in the required manner by occurring both as\r\nnon-cross-overs and as cross-overs. The error, therefore, should be very\r\nsmall. For three pairs of gens there are eight classes, and in order that\r\neach of them may appear as a non-cross-over, as each single cross-over, and\r\nas the double cross-over, four experiments must be made. {20}\r\n\r\nHOW THE FACTORS ARE LOCATED IN THE CHROMOSOMES.\r\n\r\nA character is in the first chromosome if it is transmitted by the\r\ngrandfather to half of his grandsons, while, in the reciprocal cross, the\r\nmother transmits her character to all her sons (criss-cross inheritance)\r\nand to half of her granddaughters and to half of her grandsons; in other\r\nwords, if the factor that differentiates the character has the same\r\ndistribution as the X chromosome. If, however, a new mutant type does not\r\nshow this sex-linked inheritance, its chromosome is determined by taking\r\nadvantage of the fact that in _Drosophila_ there is no crossing-over in the\r\nmale between factors in the same chromosome. For instance, if a new mutant\r\ntype is found not to be sex-linked, its group is determined by the\r\nfollowing tests: It is crossed to black, whose factor is known to be in the\r\nsecond chromosome, and to pink, whose factor lies in the third chromosome.\r\nIf the factor of the new form should happen to be in the second chromosome,\r\nthen, in the cross with black, no double recessive can appear, so that the\r\nF_{2} proportion is 2:1:1:0; but with pink, the mutant type should give the\r\nproportion 9:3:3:1, typical of free assortment.\r\n\r\nIf, however, the factor of the new form is in the third chromosome, then,\r\nwhen crossed to black, the double recessive and the 9:3:3:1 proportion\r\nappear in F_{2}. But when crossed to pink no double recessive appears in\r\nF_{2}, and the proportion 2:1:1:0 occurs.\r\n\r\nIf these tests show that the new mutant does not belong to either the\r\nsecond or third chromosome, that is, if both with black and with pink the\r\n9:3:3:1 ratio is obtained, then by exclusion the factor lies in the fourth\r\nchromosome, in which as yet only two factors have been found.\r\n\r\nWe propose to give in a series of papers an account of the mutant races of\r\n_Drosophila_ and the linkage shown in their inheritance. In this paper we\r\nshall consider only the members of the first chromosome, describing a large\r\nnumber of new mutants with their linkage relations and summarizing to date\r\nall the linkage data relating to the first chromosome. In later papers we\r\npropose to consider the members of the second, third, and fourth\r\nchromosomes.\r\n\r\nThe list at the top of page 21 gives the names of the factors dealt with in\r\nthis paper. They stand in the order of their discovery, the mutant forms\r\nreported here for the first time being starred.\r\n\r\nIn each experiment the percentage of crossing-over is found by dividing the\r\nnumber of the cross-overs by the sum of the non-cross-overs and the\r\ncross-overs, and multiplying this quotient by 100. The resulting\r\npercentages, or cross-over values, are used as measures of the distances\r\nbetween loci. Thus if the experiments give a cross-over value of 5 per cent\r\nfor white and bifid, we say that white and bifid lie 5 units apart in the X\r\nchromosome. Other experiments show that yellow and white are about 1 unit\r\napart, and that yellow and bifid are about 6 units apart. We can therefore\r\nconstruct a diagram with yellow as {21} the zero, with white at 1, and with\r\nbifid at 6. If we know the cross-over values given by a new mutant with any\r\ntwo mutants of the same chromosome whose positions are already determined,\r\nthen we can locate the new factor with accuracy, and be able to predict the\r\ncross-over value which the new factor will give with any other factor whose\r\nposition is plotted.\r\n\r\n_The sex-linked factors of Drosophila._\r\n\r\n

of crossing-over is small), because when the\r\namount of crossing-over is large a correction must be made for double\r\ncrossing-over, and the correction can be best found through breaking up the\r\nlong distances into short ones, by using intermediate points.\r\n\r\nConversely, when a long distance is indicated on the chromosome diagram,\r\nthe actual cross-over value found by experiment

the basis of all the data summarized in\r\ntable 65 (p. 84) for the first or X chromosome. It shows the relative\r\npositions of the gens of the sex-linked characters of _Drosophila_. One\r\nunit of distance corresponds to 1 per cent of crossing-over. Since all\r\ndistances are corrected for double crossing-over and for coincidence, the\r\nvalues represent the _total_ of crossing-over between the loci. The\r\nuncorrected value obtained in any experiment with two loci widely separated\r\nwill be smaller than the value given in the map.\r\n\r\nIt may be asked what will happen when two factors whose loci are more than\r\n50 units apart in the same chromosome are used in the same experiment? One\r\nmight expect to get more than 50 per cent of cross-overs with such an\r\nexperiment, but double crossing-over becomes disproportionately greater the\r\nlonger the distance involved, so that in experiments the observed\r\npercentage of crossing-over does not rise above 50 per cent. For example,\r\nif eosin is tested against bar, somewhat under 50 per cent of cross-overs\r\nare obtained, but if the distance of bar from eosin is found by summation\r\nof the component distances the interval for eosin bar is 56 units.\r\n\r\nIn calculating the loci of the first chromosome, a system of weighting was\r\nused which allowed each case to influence the positions of the loci in\r\nproportion to the amount of the data. In this way advantage was taken of\r\nthe entire mass of data.\r\n\r\nThe factors (lethal 1, white, facet, abnormal, notch, and bifid) which lie\r\nclose to yellow were the first to be calculated and plotted. The next step\r\nwas to determine very accurately the position of vermilion with respect to\r\nyellow. There are many separate experiments which influence this\r\ncalculation and all were proportionately weighted. Then, using vermilion as\r\nthe fixed point the factors (dot, reduplicated, miniature, and sable) which\r\nlie close to vermilion were plotted. The same process was repeated in\r\nlocating bar with respect to vermilion and the factors about bar with\r\nreference to bar. The last step was to interpolate the factors (club,\r\nlethal 2, lemon, depressed, and shifted), which form a group about midway\r\nbetween yellow and vermilion. Of these, club is the only one whose location\r\nis accurate. The apparent closeness of the grouping of these loci is not to\r\nbe taken as significant, for they have been placed only with reference to\r\nthe distant points yellow and vermilion and not with respect to each other;\r\nfurthermore, the data available in the cases of lemon and depressed are\r\nvery meager.\r\n\r\nThe factors which are most important and are most accurately located are\r\nyellow, white (eosin), bifid, club, vermilion, miniature, sable, forked,\r\nand bar. Of these again, white (eosin), vermilion, and bar are of prime\r\nimportance and will probably continue to claim first rank. Of the three\r\nallelomorphs, white, eosin, and cherry, eosin is the most useful. {24}\r\n\r\nNOMENCLATURE.\r\n\r\nThe system of symbols used in the diagrams and table headings is as\r\nfollows: The factor or gen for a recessive mutant character is represented\r\nby a lower-case letter, as v for vermilion and m for miniature. The symbols\r\nfor the dominant mutant characters bar, abnormal, and notch are B', A', and\r\nN'. There are now so many characters that it is impossible to represent all\r\nof them by a single letter. We therefore add a subletter in such cases, as\r\nbifid (b_i), fused (f_u), and lethal 2 (l_2). In the case of multiple\r\nallelomorphs we usually use as the base of the symbol the symbol of that\r\nmember of the system which was first found and add a letter as an exponent\r\nto indicate the particular member, as y^s for spot, w^e for eosin, and w^c\r\nfor cherry. The normal allelomorphs of the mutant gens are indicated by the\r\nconverse letter, as V for not-vermilion, B_i for not-bifid, and b' for\r\nnot-bar. In the table headings the normal allelomorphs are indicated by\r\nposition alone without the use of a symbol.\r\n\r\nThus the symbol [draw] indicates that the female in question carried eosin,\r\nnot-vermilion, and bar in one chromosome and not-eosin, vermilion, and\r\nnot-bar in the other. The symbol [draw] when used in the heading of a\r\ncolumn in a table indicates that the flies classified under this heading\r\nare the result of single crossing-over between eosin and vermilion in a\r\nmother which was the composition [draw]; the symbol tells at the same time\r\nthat the flies that result from a single cross-over between eosin and\r\nvermilion in the mother are of the two contrary classes, eosin bar and\r\nvermilion. When a fly shows two or more non-allelomorphic characters the\r\nnames are written from left to right in the order of their positions from\r\nthe zero end of the map.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{25}\r\n\r\nPART II. NEW DATA.\r\n\r\nWHITE.\r\n\r\n(Plate II, figure 11.)\r\n\r\nThe recessive character white eye-color, which appeared in May 1910, was\r\nthe first sex-linked mutation in _Drosophila_ (Morgan, 1910_a_, 1910_b_).\r\nSoon afterwards (June 1910) rudimentary appeared, and the two types were\r\ncrossed (Morgan, 1910_c_). Under the conditions of culture the viability of\r\nrudimentary was extremely poor, but the data demonstrated the occurrence of\r\nrecombination of the factors in the ovogenesis so that white and\r\nrudimentary, though both sex-linked, were brought together into the same\r\nindividual. The results were not fully recognized as linkage, because white\r\nand rudimentary are so far apart in the chromosome that they seemed to\r\nassort freely from each other.\r\n\r\nOwing to the excellent viability and the perfect sharpness of separation,\r\nwhite was extensively used in linkage experiments, especially with\r\nminiature and yellow (Morgan, 1911_a_; Morgan and Cattell, 1912 and 1913).\r\nWhite has been more extensively used than any other character in\r\n_Drosophila_, though it is now being used very little because of the fact\r\nthat the double recessives of white with other sex-linked eye-colors, such\r\nas vermilion, are white, and consequently a separation into the true\r\ngenetic classes is impossible. The place of white has been taken by eosin,\r\nwhich is an allelomorph of white and which can be readily used with any\r\nother eye-color.\r\n\r\nThe locus of white and its allelomorphs is only 1.1 units from that of\r\nyellow, which is the zero of the chromosome. Yellow and white are very\r\nclosely linked, therefore giving only about one cross-over per 100 flies.\r\n\r\nAll the published data upon the linkage of white with other sex-linked\r\ncharacters have been collected into table 65.\r\n\r\nRUDIMENTARY.\r\n\r\nRudimentary, which appeared in June 1910, was the second sex-linked\r\ncharacter in _Drosophila_ (Morgan, 1910_c_). Its viability has always been\r\nvery poor; in this respect it is one of the very poorest of the sex-linked\r\ncharacters. The early linkage data (Morgan, 1911_a_) derived from mass\r\ncultures have all been discarded. By breeding from a single F_1 female in\r\neach large culture bottle it has been possible to obtain results which are\r\nfairly trustworthy (Morgan, 1912_g_; Morgan and Tice, 1914). These data\r\nappear in table 65, which summarizes all the published data. {26}\r\n\r\nThe locus of rudimentary is at 55.1, for a long time the extreme right end\r\nof the known chromosome, though recently several mutants have been found to\r\nlie somewhat beyond it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. A. _a._ rudimentary wing; _b._ the wild fly for\r\ncomparison.]\r\n\r\nThe rudimentary males are perfectly fertile, but the rudimentary females\r\nrarely produce any offspring at all, and then only a very few. The reason\r\nfor this is that most of the germ-cells cease their development in the\r\nearly growth stage of the eggs (Morgan, 1915_a_).\r\n\r\nMINIATURE.\r\n\r\n(Plate II. figures 7 and 8.)\r\n\r\nThe recessive sex-linked mutant miniature wings appeared in August 1910\r\n(Morgan, 1911b and 1912a). The viability of miniature is fair, and this\r\nstock has been used in linkage experiments more than any {27} other, with\r\nthe single exception of white. While the wings of miniature usually extend\r\nbackwards, they are sometimes held out at right angles to the body, and\r\nespecially in acid bottles the miniature flies easily become stuck to the\r\nfood or the wings become stringy, so that other wing characters are not\r\neasy to distinguish in those flies which are also miniature. At present\r\nvermilion, whose locus is at 33, in being used more frequently in linkage\r\nwork. The locus of miniature at 36.1 is slightly beyond the middle of the\r\nchromosome.\r\n\r\nVERMILION.\r\n\r\n(Plate II. figure 10.)\r\n\r\nThe recessive sex-linked mutant vermilion eye-color (Morgan, 1911_c_ and\r\n1912_a_) appeared in November 1910, and has appeared at least twice since\r\nthen (Morgan and Plough, 1915). This is one of the best of the sex-linked\r\ncharacters, on account of its excellent viability, its sharp distinction\r\nfrom normal with very little variability, its value as a double recessive\r\nin combination with other sex-linked eye-colors, and because of its\r\nlocation at 33.0, very near to the middle of the known chromosome.\r\n\r\nYELLOW.\r\n\r\n(Plate I. figure 5.)\r\n\r\nThe recessive sex-linked mutant yellow body and wing-color appeared in\r\nJanuary 1911 (Morgan, 1911_c_ and 1912_a_). Its first appearance was in\r\nblack stock; hence the fly was a double recessive, then called brown. Later\r\nthe same mutation has appeared independently from gray stock. Yellow was\r\nfound to be at the end of the X chromosome, and this end was arbitrarily\r\nchosen as the zero or the \"left end,\" while the other gens are spoken of as\r\nlying at various distances to the right of yellow. Recently a lethal gen\r\nhas been located less than one-tenth of a unit (-0.04) to the left of\r\nyellow, but yellow is still retained as the zero-point.\r\n\r\nThe viability of yellow is fairly good and the character can be separated\r\nfrom gray with great facility, and in consequence yellow has been used\r\nextensively, although at present it is being used less than formerly, since\r\neosin lies only 1.1 units distant from yellow and is generally preferred.\r\n\r\nABNORMAL ABDOMEN.\r\n\r\n(Plate I. figure 4.)\r\n\r\nThe dominant sex-linked character abnormal abdomen appeared in July 1911\r\n(Morgan, 1911_d_). It was soon found that the realization of the abnormal\r\ncondition depended greatly upon the nature of the environment (Morgan,\r\n1912). Recently a very extensive study of this character has been published\r\n(Morgan, 1915). As this case has been reviewed in the introduction, there\r\nis little further to be said here. {28} Because of the change that takes\r\nplace as the culture grows older (the abnormal changing to normal), this\r\ncharacter is not of much value in linkage work. The location of the factor\r\nin the X chromosome at 2.4 has been made out from the data given by Morgan\r\n(1915_b_). These data, which in general include only the abnormal classes,\r\nare summarized in table 1.\r\n\r\nTABLE 1.--_Linkage data, from Morgan, 1915b._\r\n\r\n  +------------------+-----------+-----------+------------+\r\n  |     Gens.        |  Total.   |   Cross-  | Cross-over |\r\n  |                  |           |   overs.  |  values.   |\r\n  +------------------+-----------+-----------+------------+\r\n  | Yellow white     |  28,018   |    334    |    1.2     |\r\n  | Yellow abnormal  |  15,314   |    299    |    2.0     |\r\n  | White abnormal   |  16,300   |    277    |    1.7     |\r\n  +------------------+-----------+-----------+------------+\r\n\r\nEOSIN.\r\n\r\n(Plate II, figures 7 and 8.)\r\n\r\nThe recessive sex-linked mutation eosin eye-color appeared in August 1911\r\nin a culture of white-eyed flies (Morgan 1912_a_). The eye-color is\r\ndifferent in the male and female, the male being a light pinkish yellow,\r\nwhile the female is a rather dark yellowish pink. Eosin is allelomorphic to\r\nwhite and the white-eosin compound or heterozygote has the color of the\r\neosin male. There is probably no special significance in this coincidence\r\nof color, since similar dilutions to various degrees have been demonstrated\r\nfor all the other eye-colors tested (Morgan and Bridges, 1913). Since eosin\r\nis allelomorphic to white, its locus is also at 1.1. Eosin is the most\r\nuseful character among all those in the left end of the chromosome.\r\n\r\nBIFID.\r\n\r\nThe sex-linked wing mutant bifid, which appeared in November 1911, is\r\ncharacterized by the fusion of all the longitudinal veins into a heavy\r\nstalk at the base of the wing. The wing stands out from the body at a wide\r\nangle, so that the fusion is easily seen. At the tip of the wing the third\r\nlongitudinal vein spreads out into a delta which reaches to the marginal\r\nvein. The fourth longitudinal vein reaches the margin only rarely. There is\r\nvery often opposite this vein a great bay in the margin, or the whole wing\r\nis irregularly truncated.\r\n\r\nThe stock of bifid was at first extremely varied in the amount of this\r\ntruncation. By selection a stock was secured which showed only very greatly\r\nreduced wings like those shown in figures _a_, b. Another stock (figs. _c_,\r\n_d_) was secured by outcrossing and selection which showed wings of nearly\r\nnormal size and shape, which always had the bifid stalk, generally the\r\nspread positions (not as extreme), and often the delta and the shortened\r\nfourth longitudinal vein. We believe that the extreme reduction in size\r\nseen in the one stock was due to an added modifier of {29} the nature of\r\nbeaded, since this could be eliminated by outcrossing and selection.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. B.--Bifid wing. _c_ and _d_ show the typical condition\r\nof bifid wings. All the longitudinal veins are fused into a heavy stalk at\r\nthe base of the wing. _a_ shows the typical position in which the bifid\r\nwings are held. The small size of the wings in _a_ and _b_ is due to the\r\naction of a modifier of the nature of \"beaded\" which has been eliminated in\r\n_c_, d.]\r\n\r\nLINKAGE OF BIFID WITH YELLOW, WITH WHITE, AND WITH VERMILION.\r\n\r\nThe stock of the normal (not-beaded) bifid was used by Dr. R. Chambers,\r\nJr., for determining the chromosome locus of bifid by means of its linkage\r\nrelations to vermilion, white, and yellow (Chambers, 1913). We have\r\nattempted to bring together in table 2 the complete data and to calculate\r\nthe locus of bifid.\r\n\r\nTABLE 2.--_Linkage data, from Chambers, 1913._\r\n\r\n  +-----------------+------------+-------------+--------------+\r\n  |      Gens.      |   Total.   |    Cross-   |  Cross-over  |\r\n  |                 |            |    overs.   |   values.    |\r\n  +-----------------+------------+-------------+--------------+\r\n  | Yellow bifid    |    3,175   |      182    |     5.8      |\r\n  | White bifid     |   20,800   |    1,127    |     5.3      |\r\n  | Bifid vermilion |    2,509   |      806    |    32.1      |\r\n  +-----------------+------------+-------------+--------------+\r\n\r\n{30}\r\n\r\nIn the crosses between white and bifid there were 1,127 cross-overs in a\r\ntotal of 20,800 available individuals, which gives a cross-over value of\r\n5.3. In the crosses between yellow and bifid there were 182 cross-overs in\r\na total of 3,175 available individuals, which gives a cross-over value of\r\n5.8. In crosses between bifid and vermilion there were 806 cross-overs in a\r\ntotal of 2,509, which gives a cross-over value of 32.1. On the basis of all\r\nthe data summarized in table 65, bifid is located at 6.3 to the right of\r\nyellow.\r\n\r\nLINKAGE OF CHERRY, BIFID, AND VERMILION.\r\n\r\nIn a small experiment of our own, three factors were involved--cherry,\r\nbifid, and vermilion. A cherry vermilion female was crossed to a bifid\r\nmale. Two daughters were back-crossed singly to white bifid males. The\r\nfemale offspring will then give data for the linkage of cherry white with\r\nbifid, while the sons will show the linkage of the three gens, cherry,\r\nbifid, and vermilion. The results are shown in table 3.\r\n\r\nTABLE 3.--_P_1 cherry vermilion [female] [female] x bifid [male] [male].

The order of the factors, viz,\r\ncherry, bifid, vermilion, is established by taking advantage of the double\r\ncross-over classes in the males. The male classes give a cross-over value\r\nof 20 for bifid vermilion and 24 for cherry vermilion, which are low\r\ncompared with values given by other experiments. The locus of bifid at 6.3\r\nis convenient for many linkage problems, but this advantage is largely\r\noffset by the liability of the bifid flies to become stuck in the food and\r\nagainst the sides of the bottle. Bifid flies can be separated from the\r\nnormal with certainty and with great ease. {31}\r\n\r\nREDUPLICATED LEGS.\r\n\r\nIn November 1912 Miss Mildred Hoge found that a certain stock was giving\r\nsome males whose legs were reduplicated, either completely or only with\r\nrespect to the terminal segments (described and figured, Hoge, 1915).\r\nSubsequent work by Miss Hoge showed that the condition was due to a\r\nsex-linked gen, but that at room temperature not all the flies that were\r\ngenetically reduplicated showed reduplication. However, if the flies were\r\nraised through the pupa stage in the ice-box at a temperature of about\r\n10deg to 12deg a majority of the flies which were expected to show\r\nreduplication did so. The most extremely reduplicated individual showed\r\nparts of 14 legs.\r\n\r\nIn studying the cross-over values of reduplicated, only those flies that\r\nhave abnormal legs are to be used in calculation, as in the case of\r\nabnormal abdomen where the phenotypically normal individuals are partly\r\ngenetically abnormal. Table 4 gives a summary of the data secured by Miss\r\nHoge.\r\n\r\nTABLE 4.--_Summary of linkage data upon reduplicated legs, from Hoge,\r\n1915._\r\n\r\n  +---------------------------+---------+---------+------------+\r\n  |         Gens.             |  Total. |  Cross- | Cross-over |\r\n  |                           |         |  overs. |  values.   |\r\n  |---------------------------+---------+---------|------------|\r\n  |                           |         |         |            |\r\n  |White reduplicated         |    418  |   121   |    29.0    |\r\n  |Reduplicated vermilion     |    667  |    11   |     1.7    |\r\n  |Reduplicated bar           |    583  |   120   |    20.6    |\r\n  |                           |         |         |            |\r\n  +---------------------------+---------+---------+------------+\r\n\r\nThe most accurate data, those upon the value for reduplicated and\r\nvermilion, give for reduplicated a distance of 1.7 from vermilion, either\r\nto the right or to the left. The distance from white is 29, which would\r\nplace the locus for reduplication to the left of vermilion, which is at 33.\r\nThe data for bar give a distance of 21, but since bar is itself 24 units\r\nfrom vermilion, this distance of 21 would seem to place the locus to the\r\nright of vermilion. The evidence is slightly in favor of this position to\r\nthe right of vermilion at 34.7, where reduplicated may be located\r\nprovisionally. In any case the locus is so near to that of vermilion that\r\nfinal decision must come from data involving double crossing-over, _i. e._,\r\nfrom a three-locus experiment.\r\n\r\nLETHAL 1.\r\n\r\nIn February 1912 Miss E. Rawls found that certain females from a wild stock\r\nwere giving only about half as many sons as daughters. Tests continuing\r\nthrough five generations showed that the sons that appeared were entirely\r\nnormal, but that half of the daughters gave again 2 : 1 sex-ratios, while\r\nthe other half gave normal 1 : 1 sex-ratios. {32}\r\n\r\nThe explanation of this mode of transmission became clear when it was found\r\nthat the cause of the death of half of the males was a particular factor\r\nthat had as definite a locus in the X chromosome as have other sex-linked\r\nfactors (Morgan, 1912_e_). Morgan mated females (from the stock sent to him\r\nby Miss Rawls) to white-eyed males. Half of the females, as expected, gave\r\n2 : 1 sex-ratios, and daughters from these were again mated to white males.\r\nHere once more half of the daughters gave 2 : 1 sex-ratios, but in such\r\ncases the sons were nearly all white-eyed and only rarely a red-eyed son\r\nappeared, when under ordinary circumstances there should be just as many\r\nred sons as white sons. The total output for 11 such females was as follows\r\n(Morgan, 1914_b_): white [female], 457; red [female], 433; white [male],\r\n370; red [male], 2. It is evident from these data that there must be\r\npresent in the sex-chromosome a gen that causes the death of every male\r\nthat receives this chromosome, and that this lethal factor lies very close\r\nto the factor for white eyes. The linkage of this lethal (now called lethal\r\n1) to various other sex-linked gens was determined (Morgan 1914_b_), and is\r\nsummarized in table 5. On the basis of these data it is found that the gen\r\nlethal 1 lies 0.4 unit to the left of white, or at 0.7.\r\n\r\nTABLE 5.--_Summary of linkage data upon lethal 1, from Morgan, 1914b, pp.\r\n81-92._\r\n\r\n  +------------------------+---------+--------+-------------+\r\n  |          Gens.         |  Total. | Cross- |  Cross-over |\r\n  |                        |         | overs. |   values.   |\r\n  +------------------------+---------+--------+-------------+\r\n  |                        |         |        |             |\r\n  | Yellow lethal 1        |    131  |    1   |     0.8     |\r\n  | Yellow miniature       |    131  |   45   |    34.4     |\r\n  | Lethal 1 white         |  1,763  |    7   |     0.4     |\r\n  | Lethal 1 miniature     |    814  |  323   |    39.7     |\r\n  | White miniature        |    994  |  397   |    39.9     |\r\n  |                        |         |        |             |\r\n  +------------------------+---------+--------+-------------+\r\n\r\nLETHAL 1a.\r\n\r\nIn the second generation of the flies bred by Miss Rawls, one female gave\r\n(March 1912) only 3 sons, although she gave 312 daughters. It was not known\r\nfor some time (see lethals 3 and 3_a_) what was the cause of this extreme\r\nrarity of sons. It is now apparent, however, that this mother carried\r\nlethal 1 in one X and in the other X a new lethal which had arisen by\r\nmutation. The new lethal was very close to lethal 1, as shown by the rarity\r\nof the surviving sons, which are cross-overs between lethal 1 and the new\r\nlethal that we may call lethal 1a. There is another class of cross-overs,\r\nnamely, those which have lethal 1 and get lethal 1_a_ by crossing-over.\r\nThese doubly lethal males must also die, but since they are theoretically\r\nas numerous as the males (3) free from both lethals, we must double this\r\nnumber (3 x 2) to get the total number of cross-overs. There were 312\r\ndaughters, but as the sons are normally about 96 per cent of the number of\r\nthe females, {33} we may take 300 as the number of the males which died.\r\nThere must have been, then, about 2 per cent of crossing-over, which makes\r\nlethal 1_a_ lie about 2 units from lethal 1. This location of lethal 1_a_\r\nis confirmed by a test that Miss Rawls made of the daughters of the\r\nhigh-ratio female. Out of 98 of these daughters none repeated the high\r\nsex-ratio and only 2 gave 1 [female] : 1 [male] ratios. The two daughters\r\nwhich gave 1 : 1 ratios are cross-overs. There should be an equal number of\r\ncross-overs which contain both lethals. These latter would not be\r\ndistinguishable from the non-cross-over females, each of which carries one\r\nor the other lethal. In calculation, allowance can be made for them by\r\ndoubling the number of observed cross-overs (2 x 2) and taking 98 - 2 as\r\nthe number of non-cross-overs. The cross-over fraction {6 + 4}/{300 + 96}\r\ngives 2.6 as the distance between the two lethals. Lethal 1_a_ is probably\r\nto the right of lethal 1 at 0.7 + 2.6 = 3.3.\r\n\r\nSPOT.\r\n\r\n(Plate II, figures 14 to 17.)\r\n\r\nIn April 1912 there was found in the stock of yellow flies a male that\r\ndiffered from yellow in that it had a conspicuous light spot on the upper\r\nsurface of the abdomen (Morgan, 1914_a_). In yellow flies this region is\r\ndark brown in color. In crosses with wild flies the spot remained with the\r\nyellow, and although some 30,000 flies were raised, none of the gray\r\noffspring showed the spot, which should have occurred had crossing-over\r\ntaken place. The most probable interpretation of spot is that it was due to\r\nanother mutation in the yellow factor, the first mutation being from gray\r\nto yellow and the second from yellow to spot.\r\n\r\nSpot behaves as an allelomorph to yellow in all crosses where the two are\r\ninvolved and is completely recessive to yellow, _i. e._, the yellow-spot\r\nhybrid is exactly like yellow. A yellow-spot female, back-crossed to a spot\r\nmale, produces yellows and spots in equal numbers.\r\n\r\nIn a cross of spot to black it was found that the double recessive, spot\r\nblack, flies that appear in F_2 have, in addition to the spot on the\r\nabdomen, another spot on the scutellum and a light streak on the thorax.\r\nThese two latter characters (\"dot and dash\") are very sharply marked and\r\nconspicuous when the flies are young, but they are only juvenile characters\r\nand disappear as the flies become older. The spot flies never show the \"dot\r\nand dash\" clearly, and it only comes out when black acts as a developer.\r\nThese characters furnish a good illustration of the fact that mutant gens\r\nordinarily affect many parts of the body, though these secondary effects\r\noften pass unnoticed.\r\n\r\nIn the F_2 of the cross of spot by black one yellow black fly appeared,\r\nalthough none are expected, on the assumption that spot and yellow {34} are\r\nallelomorphic. Unless due to crossing-over it must have been a mutation\r\nfrom spot back to yellow. Improbable as this may seem to those who look\r\nupon mutations as due to losses from the germ-plasm, yet we have records of\r\nseveral other cases where similar mutations \"backwards\" have taken place,\r\nnotably in the case of eosin to white, under conditions where the\r\nalternative interpretation of crossing-over is excluded.\r\n\r\nSABLE.\r\n\r\n(Plate I, figure 2.)\r\n\r\nIn an experiment involving black body-color[3] a fly appeared (July 19,\r\n1912) whose body-color differed slightly from ordinary black in that the\r\ntrident mark on the thorax was sharper and the color itself was brighter\r\nand clearer. This fly, a male, was mated to black females and gave some\r\nblack males and females, but also some gray (wild body-color) males and\r\nfemales, showing not only that he was heterozygous for ordinary recessive\r\nblack, but at the same time that his dark color must be due to another kind\r\nof black. The gray F_1 flies when mated together gave a series of gray and\r\ndark flies in F_2 about as follows: In the females 3 grays to 1 dark; in\r\nthe males 3 grays to 5 dark in color. The result indicated that the new\r\nblack color, which we call sable, was due to a sex-linked factor. It was\r\ndifficult to discover which of the heterogeneous F_2 males were the new\r\nblacks. Suspected males were bred (singly) to wild females, and the F_2\r\ndark males, from those cultures that gave the closest approach to a 2 gray\r\n[female] : 1 gray [male] : 1 dark [male], were bred to their sisters in\r\npairs in order to obtain sable females and males. Thus stock homozygous for\r\nsable but still containing black as an impurity was obtained. It became\r\nnecessary to free it from black by successive individual out-crossings to\r\nwild flies and extractions.\r\n\r\nThis account of how sable was purified shows how difficult it is to\r\nseparate two recessive factors that give closely similar somatic effects.\r\nIf a character like sable should be present in any other black stock, or if\r\na character like black should be present in sable, very erratic results\r\nwould be obtained if such stocks were used in experiments, before such a\r\npopulation had been separated into its component races.\r\n\r\nSable males of the purified stock were mated to wild females and gave\r\nwild-type (gray) males and females. These inbred gave the results shown in\r\ntable 6.\r\n\r\nNo sable females appeared in F_2, as seen in table 6. The reciprocal cross\r\ngave the results shown in table 7.\r\n\r\n{35}\r\n\r\nThe F_1 males were sable like their mother. The evidence thus shows that\r\nsable is a sex-linked recessive character. Our next step was to determine\r\nthe linkage relations of sable to certain other sex-linked gens, namely,\r\nyellow, eosin, cherry, vermilion, miniature, and bar.\r\n\r\nTABLE 6.--_P_1 wild [female] [female] x sable [male].

As already stated, we speak of this end as the left end of\r\nthe diagram, and yellow as the zero in locating factors.\r\n\r\nWhen yellow (not-sable) females were mated to (not-yellow) sable males they\r\ngave wild-type (gray) daughters and yellow sons. These inbred gave in F_2\r\ntwo classes of females, namely, yellow and gray, and four classes of males,\r\nnamely, yellow and sable (non-cross-overs), wild type and the double\r\nrecessive yellow sable (cross-overs). From off-spring (F_3) of the F_2\r\nyellow sable males by F_2 yellow females, pure stock of the double\r\nrecessive yellow sable was made up and used in the crosses to test linkage.\r\n\r\nIn color the yellow sable is quite similar to yellow black, that is, a rich\r\nbrown with a very dark brown trident pattern on the thorax. Yellow sable is\r\neasier to distinguish from yellow than is yellow black, even when the flies\r\nhave not yet acquired their adult body-color.\r\n\r\nYellow sable males were bred to wild females and F_1 consisted of wild-type\r\nmales and females. These inbred gave the results shown in table 8. {36}\r\n\r\nTABLE 8.--_P_1 wild [female] [female] x yellow sable [male] [male].

These values are found by\r\ndividing the number of cross-overs by the total number of individuals which\r\nmight show crossing-over, that is, males only or both males and females, as\r\nthe case may be. Free assortment would give 50 per cent of cross-overs and\r\nabsolute linkage 0 per cent of cross-overs. Except where the percentage of\r\ncrossing-over is very small these values are expressed to the nearest unit,\r\nsince the experimental error might make a closer calculation misleading.\r\n\r\nThe combined data of tables 8 and 9 give 686 cross-overs in a total of\r\n1,600 individuals in which crossing-over might occur. The females of table\r\n8 are all of one class (wild type) and are useless for this calculation\r\nexcept as a check upon viability. The cross-over value of 43 per cent shows\r\nthat crossing-over is very free. We interpret this to mean that sable is\r\nfar from yellow in the chromosome. Since yellow is at one end of the known\r\nseries, sable would then occupy a locus somewhere near the opposite end.\r\nThis can be checked up by finding its linkage relations to the other\r\nsex-linked factors. {37}\r\n\r\nLINKAGE OF CHERRY AND SABLE.\r\n\r\nThe origin of cherry eye-color (Plate II, fig. 9) has been given by Safir\r\n(Biol. Bull., 1913). From considerations which will be discussed later in\r\nthis paper we regard cherry as allelomorphic to white in a quadruple\r\nallelomorph system composed of white, eosin, cherry, and their normal red\r\nallelomorph. Cherry will then occupy the same locus as white, which is one\r\nunit to the right of yellow, and will show the same linkage relations to\r\nother factors as does white. A slightly lower cross-over value should be\r\ngiven by cherry and sable than was given by yellow and sable.\r\n\r\nWhen cherry (gray) females were crossed to (red) sable males the daughters\r\nwere wild type and the sons cherry. Inbred these gave the results shown in\r\ntable 10.\r\n\r\nTABLE 10.--_P_1 cherry [female][female] x sable [male][male].

Since\r\ncherry is one point from yellow, this result agrees extremely well with the\r\nvalue 43 for yellow and sable. Since yellow and eosin lie at the left end\r\nof the first chromosome, the high values, namely, 43 and 42, agree in\r\nmaking it very probable that sable lies near the other end (_i. e._, to the\r\nright). Sable will lie farther to the right than vermilion, for vermilion\r\nhas been shown elsewhere to give 33 per cent of crossing-over with eosin.\r\nThe location of sable to the right of vermilion has in fact been\r\nsubstantiated by all later work.\r\n\r\nLINKAGE OF EOSIN, VERMILION, AND SABLE.\r\n\r\nThree loci are involved in the next experiment. Since eosin is an\r\nallelomorph of cherry, it should be expected to give with sable the same\r\ncross-over value as did cherry. When eosin (red) sable females were crossed\r\nto (red) vermilion (gray) males, the daughters were wild type and the males\r\nwere eosin sable. Inbred these gave the classes shown in table 11. {38}\r\n\r\nTABLE 11.--_P_1 eosin sable [female] x vermilion [male][male].

Exp. Zool., 1911). The gen for miniature lies about\r\n3 units to the right of vermilion, so that it is still closer to sable than\r\nis vermilion. The double recessive, miniature sable, was made up, and males\r\nof this stock were bred to wild females (long gray). The wild-type\r\ndaughters were back-crossed to double recessive males and gave the results\r\n(mass cultures) shown in table 13.\r\n\r\nTABLE 13.--_P_1 wild [female] [female] x miniature sable [male] [male].

The combined data give 7 per cent\r\nof crossing-over between miniature and sable.\r\n\r\nLINKAGE OF VERMILION, SABLE, AND BAR.\r\n\r\nBar eye has been described by Mrs. S. C. Tice (1914). It is a dominant\r\nsex-linked character, whose locus, lying beyond vermilion and sable, is\r\nnear the right end of the chromosome series, that is, at the end opposite\r\nyellow.\r\n\r\nIn the first cross of a balanced series of experiments for the gens\r\nvermilion, sable, and bar, vermilion (gray not-bar) entered from one side\r\n([female]) and (red) sable bar from the other ([male]). The daughters were\r\nbar and the sons vermilion. The daughters were back-crossed singly to the\r\ntriple recessive males vermilion sable (not-bar), and gave the data\r\nincluded in table 14.\r\n\r\nIn the second cross, vermilion sable (not-bar) went in from one side\r\n([female]) and (red, gray) bar from the other. The daughters were bar and\r\nthe sons were vermilion sable. Since these sons have the three recessive\r\nfactors, inbreeding of F_1 is equivalent to a triple back-cross. The\r\nresults are given by pairs in table 15. {41}\r\n\r\nTABLE 14.--_P_1 vermilion [female] [female] x sable bar [male] [male]. B.\r\nC.

The amount of each kind of cross-over appears at the\r\nbottom of the table. The total amount of crossing-over between vermilion\r\nand sable is the sum of the single (9.53) and of the double (0.28)\r\ncross-overs, which value is 9.8. Likewise the cross-over value for sable\r\nbar is 13.49 + 0.28 (= 14), and for vermilion bar is 9.53 + 13.49 (= 23).\r\nBy means of these cross-over values we may calculate the coincidence\r\ninvolved, which is in this case\r\n\r\n            0.0028 x 100\r\n  --------------------------------- = 20.8\r\n  0.0953 + 0.0028 x 0.1349 + 0.0028\r\n\r\nThis value shows that there actually occurs only about 21 per cent of the\r\ndouble cross-overs which from the values of the single cross-overs are\r\nexpected to occur in this section of the chromosome. This is the result\r\nwhich is to be anticipated upon the chromosome view, for if crossing-over\r\nis connected with loops of the chromosomes, and if these loops have an\r\naverage length, then if the chromosomes cross over at one {44} point it is\r\nunlikely they will cross over again at another point nearer than the\r\naverage length of the loop.\r\n\r\nThe calculation of the locus for sable gives 43.0.\r\n\r\nDOT.\r\n\r\nIn the F_2, from a cross of a double recessive (white vermilion) female by\r\na triple recessive (eosin vermilion pink) male, there appeared, July 21,\r\n1912, three white-eyed females which had two small, symmetrically placed,\r\nblack, granular masses upon the thorax. These \"dots\" appeared to be dried\r\nexudations from pores. It did not seem possible that such an effect could\r\nbe inherited, but as this condition had never been observed before, it\r\nseemed worth while to mate the three females to their brothers. In the next\r\ngeneration about 1 per cent of the males were dotted. From these females\r\nand males a stock was made up which in subsequent generations showed from\r\n10 to 50 per cent of dot. Selection seemed to have no effect upon the\r\npercentage of dot. Although the stock never showed more than 50 per cent of\r\ndot, yet it was found that the normal individuals from the stock threw\r\nabout the same per cent as did those that were dotted, so that the stock\r\nwas probably genetically pure. The number of males which showed the\r\ncharacter was always much smaller than the number of dotted females; in the\r\nhatches which produced nearly 50 per cent of dot, nearly all the females\r\nbut very few of the males were dotted. Quite often the character showed on\r\nonly one side of the thorax.\r\n\r\nSince this character arose in an experiment involving several eye-colors an\r\neffort was made by crossing to wild and extracting to transfer the dot to\r\nflies normal in all other respects. This effort succeeded only partly, for\r\na stock was obtained which differed from the wild type only in that it bore\r\ndot (about 30 per cent) and in that the eyes were vermilion. Several\r\nattempts to get the dot separated from vermilion failed. Since this was\r\nonly part of the preliminary routine work necessary to get a mutant stock\r\nin shape for exact experimentation, no extensive records were kept.\r\n\r\nLINKAGE OF VERMILION AND DOT.\r\n\r\nWhen a dot male with vermilion eyes was bred to a wild female the offspring\r\nwere wild-type males and females. These inbred gave the data shown in table\r\n19.\r\n\r\nTABLE 19.--_P_1 vermilion dot [male] x wild [female] [female].

These\r\nthree males had also vermilion eyes, indicating linkage of dot and\r\nvermilion. The males show no deficiency in numbers, therefore the\r\nnon-appearance of the dot can not be due to its being semi-lethal. It\r\nappears, therefore, that the expression of the character must depend on the\r\npresence of an intensifying factor in one of the autosomes, or more\r\nprobably, like club, it appears only in a small percentage of flies that\r\nare genetically pure for the character.\r\n\r\nThe reciprocal cross (dot female with vermilion eyes by wild male) was made\r\n(table 20). The daughters were wild type and the sons vermilion. Not one of\r\nthe 272 sons showed dot. If the gen is sex-linked the non-appearance of dot\r\nin the F_1 males can be explained on the ground that males that are\r\ngenetically dot show dot very rarely, or that its appearance is dependent\r\nupon the intensification by an autosomal factor of the effect produced by\r\nthe sex-linked factor for dot.\r\n\r\nTABLE 20.--_P_1 vermilion dot [female] x wild [male]._\r\n\r\n  A = Wild-type [female].\r\n  B = Vermilion [male].\r\n  C = Wild-type [male].\r\n  D = Wild-type [female].\r\n  E = Vermilion [male].\r\n  F = Vermilion [female].\r\n  G = Vermilion dot [male].\r\n  H = Vermilion dot [female].\r\n  I = Dot [male].\r\n  J = Dot [female].\r\n\r\n  +--------------------++-----------------------------------------------+\r\n  |  First generation. ||              Second generation.               |\r\n  +----------+----+----++----------+----+----+----+----+----+---+---+---+\r\n  |Reference.| A  | B  ||Reference.| C  | D  | E  | F  | G  | H | I | J |\r\n  +--------------------++----------+----+----+----+----+----+---+---+---+\r\n  |  137 C.  | 44 | 45 ||   19     |211 |198 |228 |206 | 20 | 3 | 0 | 0 |\r\n  |  138 C.  | 77 | 62 ||   22     |266 |220 |227 |227 | 16 | 0 | 0 | 0 |\r\n  |          |124 |124 ||   28     |143 |149 |125 |124 | 14 | 1 | 0 | 0 |\r\n  |          | 57 | 41 ||          +----+----+----+----+----+---+---+---+\r\n  |          |----|----||    Total.|620 |567 |570 |557 | 50 | 4 | 0 | 0 |\r\n  |    Total.|291 |272 ||          |    |    |    |    |    |   |   |   |\r\n  +--------------------++----------+----+----+----+----+----+---+---+---+\r\n\r\nThe F_2 generation is given in table 20. The dot reappeared in F_2 both in\r\nfemales and in males, but instead of appearing in 50 per cent of both\r\nsexes, as expected if it is simply sex-linked, it appeared in 4.0 per cent\r\nin the females and in only 0.4 per cent in the males. The failure of the\r\ncharacter to be fully realized is again apparent, but here, where it is\r\npossible for it to be realized equally in males and females, we find that\r\nthere are 50 females with dot to only 4 dot males. This would indicate that\r\nthe character is partially \"_sex-limited_\" (Morgan, 1914_d_) in its\r\nrealization. The dot appeared only in flies with vermilion eyes, indicating\r\nextremely strong linkage between vermilion and dot.\r\n\r\nThe evidence from the history of the stock, together with these\r\nexperiments, shows that the character resembles club (wing) in that it is\r\nnot expressed somatically in all the flies which are homozygous for it. In\r\nthe case of club we were fortunate enough to find a constant feature {46}\r\nwhich we could use as an index, but, so far as we have been able to see,\r\nthere is no such constant accessory character in the case of the dot.\r\nUnlike club, dot is markedly sex-limited in its effect; that is, there is a\r\ndifference of expression of the gen in the male and female. This difference\r\nrecalls the sexual dimorphism of the eosin eye.\r\n\r\nBOW.\r\n\r\nIn an F_2 generation from rudimentary males by wild females there appeared,\r\nAugust 15, 1912, a single male whose wings instead of being flat were\r\nturned down over the abdomen (fig. c). The curvature was uniform throughout\r\nthe length of the wing. A previous mutation, arc, of this same type had\r\nbeen found to be a recessive character in the second group. The new\r\nmutation, bow, is less extreme than arc and is more variable in the amount\r\nof curvature. When the bow male was mated to wild females the offspring had\r\nstraight wings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG.

This\r\ndeficiency is due in part to viability but more to a failure to recognize\r\nall the bow-winged individuals, so that some of them were classified among\r\nthe not-bow or straight wings. In favor of the view that the classification\r\nwas not strict is the fact that the sum of the two male classes about\r\nequals the number of the females.\r\n\r\nBOW BY ARC.\r\n\r\nWhen this mutant first appeared its similarity to arc led us to suspect\r\nthat it might be arc itself or an allelomorph of arc. It was bred,\r\ntherefore, to arc. The bow male by arc females gave straight (normal)\r\nwinged males and females. The appearance of straight wings shows that bow\r\nis not arc nor allelomorphic to arc. When made later, the reciprocal cross\r\nof bow female by arc male gave in F_1 straight-winged females but bow\r\nmales. This result is in accordance with the interpretation that bow is a\r\nsex-linked recessive. Further details of these last two experiments may now\r\nbe given. The F_1 (wild-type) flies from bow male by arc female were\r\ninbred. The data are given in table 22.\r\n\r\nTABLE 22.--_P_1 bow [male] x arc [female]._\r\n\r\n  +--------------------------------------------+\r\n  |            First generation.               |\r\n  +----------+------------------+--------------+\r\n  |Reference.|    Wild-type     |  Wild-type   ~\r\n  |          |[female] [female].|[male] [male].~\r\n  +----------+------------------+--------------+\r\n  |   71 C.  |       48         |      43      |\r\n  |   75 C.  |       28         |      27      |\r\n  |          +------------------+--------------+\r\n  |    Total.|       76         |      70      |\r\n  +----------+------------------+--------------+\r\n\r\n  +------------------------------+\r\n  |      Second generation.      |\r\n  +----------+---------+---------+\r\n  ~Reference.|Straight.|  Not-   |\r\n  ~          |         |straight.|\r\n  +----------+---------+---------+\r\n  |   71 C.  |   179   |   133   |\r\n  +----------+---------+---------+\r\n\r\nBow and arc are so much alike that they give a single rather variable\r\nphenotypic class in F_2. Therefore the F_2 generation is made up of only\r\ntwo separable classes--flies with straight wings and flies with\r\nnot-straight wings. The ratio of the two should be theoretically 9:7, which\r\nis approximately realized in 179:133.\r\n\r\nIf the distribution of the characters according to sex is ignored, the case\r\nis similar to the case of the two white races of sweet peas, which bred\r\ntogether gave wild-type or purple peas in F_1 and in F_2 gave 9 colored to\r\n7 white. If sex is taken into account, the theoretical expectation for the\r\nF_2 females is 6 straight to 2 arc, and for the F_2 males 3 straight to 1\r\narc to 3 bow to 1 bow-arc.\r\n\r\nThe F_1 from bow females by arc male and their F_2 offspring are given in\r\ntable 23. {48}\r\n\r\nTABLE 23.--_P_1 bow [female] x arc [male]._\r\n\r\n  +--------------------------------------------+\r\n  |           First generation.                |\r\n  |----------+------------------+--------------+\r\n  |Reference.|    Wild-type     |     Bow      |\r\n  |          |[female] [female].|[male] [male].|\r\n  |----------+------------------+--------------+\r\n  |  72 C.   |       22         |      19      ~\r\n  |  73 C.   |       12         |      10      ~\r\n  |   5 I.   |       22         |      21      |\r\n  |  74 C.   |       56         |      52      |\r\n  |          |------------------+--------------+\r\n  |    Total.|      112         |     102      |\r\n  +----------+------------------+--------------+\r\n\r\n  +------------------------------+\r\n  |         Second generation.   |\r\n  +----------+---------+---------+\r\n  |Reference.|Straight.|  Not-   |\r\n  |          |         |straight.|\r\n  +----------+---------+---------+\r\n  ~    3 I.  |   56    |   69    |\r\n  ~  3.1 I.  |   46    |   62    |\r\n  |    5 I.  |   56    |   68    |\r\n  |  5.1 I.  |   90    |  108    |\r\n  +----------+---------+---------+\r\n  |    Total.|  248    |  307    |\r\n  +----------+---------+---------+\r\n\r\nIn this case the F_2 expectation is 6 straight to 10 not-straight. Since\r\nthe sex-linked gen bow entered from the female, half the F_2 males and\r\nfemales are bow. The half that are not-bow consist of 3 straight to 1 arc,\r\nso that both in the female classes and in the male classes there are 3\r\nstraight to 5 not-straight or in all 6 straight to 10 not-straight. The\r\nrealized result, 248 straight to 307 not-straight, is more nearly a 3:4\r\nratio, due probably to a wrong classification of some of the bow as\r\nstraight.\r\n\r\nLEMON BODY-COLOR.\r\n\r\n(Plate I, figure 3.)\r\n\r\nA few males of a new mutant with a lemon-colored body and wings appeared in\r\nAugust 1912. The lemon flies (Plate II, fig. 3) resemble quite closely the\r\nyellow flies (Plate II, fig. 4). They are paler and the bristles, instead\r\nof being brown, are black. These flies are so weak that despite most\r\ncareful attention they get stuck to the food, so that they die before\r\nmating. The stock was at first maintained in mass from those cultures that\r\ngave the greatest percentage of lemon flies. In a few cases lemon males\r\nmated with their gray sisters left offspring, but the stock obtained in\r\nthis way had still to be maintained by breeding heterozygotes, as stated\r\nabove. But from the gray sisters heterozygous for lemon (bred to lemon\r\nmales) some lemon females were also produced.\r\n\r\nLINKAGE OF CHERRY, LEMON, AND VERMILION.\r\n\r\nIn order to study the linkage of lemon, the following experiment was\r\ncarried out. Since it was impracticable to breed directly from the lemon\r\nflies, virgin females were taken from stock throwing lemon, and were mated\r\nsingly to cherry vermilion males. Only a few of the females showed\r\nthemselves heterozygous for lemon by producing lemon as well as gray sons.\r\nHalf the daughters of such a pair are expected to be heterozygous for lemon\r\nand also for cherry and vermilion, which went in from the father. These\r\ndaughters were mated singly to cherry vermilion males, and those that gave\r\nsome lemon sons were continued, {49} and are recorded in table 24. The four\r\nclasses of females were not separated from each other, but the total of\r\nfemales is given in the table.\r\n\r\nTABLE 24.--_P_1 lemon (het.) [female] x cherry vermilion [male] [male].

Of these loci two were known, cherry and vermilion. The data are\r\nconsistent with the assumption that the lemon locus is between cherry and\r\nvermilion, for the double cross-over classes (the smallest classes) are\r\ncherry lemon vermilion and wild type. The number of single cross-overs\r\nbetween cherry and lemon and between lemon and vermilion are also\r\nconsistent with this assumption. Since lemon flies fail to emerge\r\nsuccessfully, depending in part upon the condition of the bottle, the\r\nclasses involving lemon are worthless in calculating crossing-over and are\r\nhere ignored. In other words, lemon may be treated as though it did not\r\nappear at all, _i. e._, as a lethal. The not-lemon classes--cherry,\r\nvermilion, cherry vermilion, and wild type--give the following approximate\r\ncross-over values for the three loci involved: Cherry lemon, 15; lemon\r\nvermilion, 12; cherry vermilion, 27. The locus of lemon, calculated by\r\ninterpolation, is at about 17.5.\r\n\r\nLETHAL 2.\r\n\r\nIn September 1912 a certain wild female produced 78 daughters and only 16\r\nsons (Morgan, 1914_b_); 63 of these daughters were tested and 31 of them\r\ngave 2 females to 1 male, while 32 of them gave 1:1 sex-ratios. This shows\r\nthat the mother of the original high sex-ratio was heterozygous for a\r\nrecessive sex-linked lethal. In order to determine the position of this\r\nlethal, a lethal-bearing female was bred to an eosin (or white) miniature\r\nmale, and those daughters that were heterozygous for eosin, lethal, and\r\nminiature were then back-crossed to {50} eosin miniature males. The\r\ndaughters that result from such a cross give only the amount of\r\ncrossing-over between eosin and miniature (as 29.7), but the males give the\r\ncross-over values for eosin lethal (9.9), lethal miniature (15.4), and\r\neosin miniature (25.1). The data for this cross are given in table 25.\r\n\r\nTABLE 25.--_Total data upon linkage of eosin, lethal 2, and miniature, from\r\nMorgan, 1914b._\r\n\r\n  +------------------------------------+\r\n  |             Females.               |\r\n  +--------+--------------+------------+\r\n  |        |              |            |\r\n  | Total. | Cross-overs. | Cross-over |\r\n  |        |              | value.     ~\r\n  |        |              |            ~\r\n  +--------+--------------+------------+\r\n  | 15,904 |    4,736     |    29.7    |\r\n  +--------+--------------+------------+\r\n\r\n  +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n  |                                 Males.                                |\r\n  +--------+--------+--------+---------+----------------------------------+\r\n  |w^e    m|w^e l_2 |w^e     |w^e l_2 m|        Cross-over values.        |\r\n  |--------|---+----|------+-|---+---+-+----------+-----------+-----------+\r\n  ~    l_2 |       m|   l_2 m|         | Eosin    | Lethal 2  | Eosin     |\r\n  ~        |        |        |         | lethal 2.| miniature.| miniature.|\r\n  +--------+--------+--------+---------+----------+-----------+-----------+\r\n  |  5,045 |   653  |  1,040 |    14   |    9.9   |    15.4   |    25.1   |\r\n  +--------+--------+--------+---------+----------+-----------+-----------+\r\n\r\nA similar experiment, in which eosin and vermilion were used instead of\r\neosin and miniature, is summarized in table 26.\r\n\r\nTABLE 26.--_Total data upon the linkage of eosin, lethal 2, and vermilion,\r\nfrom Morgan, 1914b._\r\n\r\n  +------------------------------------+\r\n  |            Females.                |\r\n  +--------+--------------+------------+\r\n  |        |              |            |\r\n  | Total. | Cross-overs. | Cross-over |\r\n  |        |              | value.     ~\r\n  |        |              |            ~\r\n  +--------+--------------+------------+\r\n  |  2,656 |      729     |    27.5    |\r\n  +--------+--------------+------------+\r\n\r\n  +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n  |                                Males.                                 |\r\n  +--------+--------+--------+---------+----------------------------------+\r\n  |w^e    v|w^e l_2 |w^e     |w^e l_2 v|        Cross-over values.        |\r\n  |--------|---+----|------+-|---+---+-+----------+-----------+-----------+\r\n  ~    l_2 |       v|   l_2 v|         | Eosin    | Lethal 2  | Eosin     |\r\n  ~        |        |        |         | lethal 2.| vermilion.| vermilion.|\r\n  +--------+--------+--------+---------+----------+-----------+-----------+\r\n  |   902  |   124  |   227  |    6    |    10.3  |    18.5   |    27.9   |\r\n  +--------+--------+--------+---------+----------+-----------+-----------+\r\n\r\nConsiderable data in which lethal was not involved were also obtained in\r\nthe course of these experiments and are included in the summary of the\r\ntotal data given in table 27.\r\n\r\nTABLE 27.--_Summary of all data upon lethal 2, from Morgan, 1914b._\r\n\r\n  +--------------------+--------+--------------+------------+\r\n  | Gens.              | Total. | Cross-overs. | Cross-over |\r\n  |                    |        |              | values.    |\r\n  +--------------------+--------+--------------+------------+\r\n  | White lethal 2     |  8,011 |      767     |     9.6    |\r\n  | White vermilion    |  6,023 |    1,612     |    26.8    |\r\n  | White miniature    | 36,021 |   11,048     |    30.7    |\r\n  | Lethal 2 vermilion |  1,400 |      248     |    17.7    |\r\n  | Lethal 2 miniature |  6,752 |    1,054     |    15.4    |\r\n  +--------------------+--------+--------------+------------+\r\n\r\nThe amount of crossing-over between eosin and lethal is about 10 per cent\r\nand the amount of crossing-over between lethal and miniature is about 18\r\nper cent. Since the amount of crossing-over between eosin {51} and\r\nminiature is over 30 per cent, the lethal factor must lie between eosin and\r\nminiature, somewhat nearer to eosin. It is impossible at present to locate\r\nlethal 2 accurately because of a real discrepancy in the data, which makes\r\nit appear that lethal 2 extends for a distance of about 5 units along the\r\nchromosome from about 10 to about 15. Work is being done which it is hoped\r\nwill make clear the reason for this. For the present we may locate lethal 2\r\nat the midpoint of its range, or at 12.5.\r\n\r\nCHERRY.\r\n\r\n(Plate II, figure 9.)\r\n\r\nThe origin of the eye-color cherry has been given by Safir (Biol. Bull.,\r\n1913).\r\n\r\nCherry appeared (October 1912) in an experiment involving vermilion\r\neye-color and miniature wings. This is the only time the mutant has ever\r\ncome up, and although several of this mutant (males) appeared in Safir's\r\nexperiment, they may have all come from the same mother. It is probable\r\nthat the mutation occurred in the vermilion stock only a generation or so\r\nbefore the experiment was made, for otherwise cherry would be expected to\r\nbe found also in the vermilion stock from which the mothers were taken;\r\nhowever, it was not found.\r\n\r\nA SYSTEM OF QUADRUPLE ALLELOMORPHS.\r\n\r\nSafir has described crosses between this eye-color and red, white, eosin,\r\nand vermilion. We conclude for reasons similar to those given by Morgan and\r\nBridges (Jour. Exp. Zool., 1913) for the case of white and eosin, that\r\ncherry is an allelomorph of white and of eosin. This is not the\r\ninterpretation followed in Safir's paper, where cherry is treated as though\r\nabsolutely linked to white or to eosin. Both interpretations give, however,\r\nthe same numerical result for each cross considered by itself. Safir's data\r\nand those which appear in this paper show that white, eosin, cherry, and a\r\nnormal (red) allelomorph form a system of quadruple allelomorphs. If this\r\ninterpretation is correct, then the linkage relations of cherry should be\r\nidentical with those of white or of eosin.\r\n\r\nLINKAGE OF CHERRY AND VERMILION.\r\n\r\nThe cross-over value for white (eosin) and vermilion, based on a very large\r\namount of data, is about 31 units. An experiment of our own in which cherry\r\nwas used with vermilion gave a cross-over value of 31 units, which is a\r\nclose approximation to the cross-over value of white and vermilion. The\r\ncross which gave this data was that of a cherry vermilion (double\r\nrecessive) male by wild females. The F_{1} wild-type flies inbred gave a\r\nsingle class of females (wild-type) and the males in four classes which\r\nshow by the deviation from a 1:1:1:1 ratio the amount of crossing-over\r\ninvolved. {52}\r\n\r\nIn one of the F_{2} male classes of table 28 the simple eye-color cherry\r\nappeared for the first time (since the original mutant was vermilion as\r\nwell as cherry). Safir has recorded a similar cross with like results.\r\n\r\nTABLE 28.--_P_{1} cherry vermilion [male] [male] x wild [female] [female].\r\nF_{1} wild-type [female] [female] x F_{1} wild-type [male] [male]._\r\n\r\n  +----------+---------+----------------+---------------+-------+------+\r\n  |          |         | Non-cross-over |  Cross-over   |       |      |\r\n  |          |         |     [male].    |    [male].    |       |      |\r\n  |          |Wild-type+----------+-----+-------+-------+Total  |Cross-|\r\n  |Reference.|[female] | Cherry   |Wild-|Cherry.| Ver-  |[male] |over  |\r\n  |          |[female].|vermilion.|type.|       |milion.|[male].|value.|\r\n  +----------+---------+----------+-----+-------+-------+-------+------+\r\n  |  160 C   |  188    |   57     |  61 |   32  |  34   |  184  |  36  |\r\n  |  161 C   |  256    |   85     |  93 |   40  |  52   |  270  |  34  |\r\n  |  162 C   |  251    |   78     |  78 |   20  |  37   |  213  |  26  |\r\n  |  163 C   |  229    |   76     |  95 |   34  |  33   |  238  |  28  |\r\n  +----------+---------+----------+-----+-------+-------+-------+------+\r\n  |  Total   |  924    |  296     | 327 |  126  | 156   |  905  |  31  |\r\n  +----------+---------+----------+-----+-------+-------+-------+------+\r\n\r\nSome cherry males were bred to wild females. The F_{1} wild-type males and\r\nfemales inbred gave the results shown in table 29. Some of the cherry males\r\nthus produced were bred to their sisters. Cherry females as well as males\r\nresulted; and it was seen that the eye-color is the same in the males and\r\nfemales, in contradistinction to the allelomorph eosin, where there is a\r\nmarked bicolorism (figs. 7, 8, Plate II). The cherry eye-color is almost\r\nidentical with that of the eosin female, but is perhaps slightly more\r\ntranslucent and brighter.\r\n\r\nTABLE 29.--_P_{1} cherry [male] [male] x wild [female] [female].

The two classes of males can be\r\nreadily distinguished; of these, one class, cherry, has the same color as\r\nthe females, while the other class, eosin, is much lighter. Such an F_2\r\ngroup will perpetuate itself, giving one type of female (of three possible\r\ngenotypic compositions, but somatically practically homogeneous) and two\r\ntypes of males, only one of which is like the females.\r\n\r\nFUSED.\r\n\r\nIn a cross between purple-eyed[6] males and black females there appeared in\r\nF_2 (Nov. 4, 1912) a male having the veins of the wing arranged as shown in\r\ntext-figure D b. It will be seen that the third and the fourth longitudinal\r\nveins are fused from the base to and beyond the {53} point at which in\r\nnormal flies the anterior cross-vein lies. The cross-vein and the cell\r\nnormally cut off by it are absent. There are a number of other features\r\n(see fig. D _c_) characteristic of this mutation: the wings are held out at\r\na wide angle from the body, the ocelli are very much reduced in size or\r\nentirely absent, the bristles around the ocelli are usually small. The\r\nfemales are absolutely sterile, not only with their own, but with any\r\nmales.\r\n\r\nFused males by wild females gave wild-type males and females. Inbred these\r\ngave the results shown in table 32. The fused character reappeared only in\r\nthe F_2 males, showing that it is a recessive sex-linked character.\r\n\r\nTABLE 32.--_P_1 fused [male] x wild [female][female]._\r\n\r\n  +-------------------------------------------------+\r\n  |              First generation.                  |\r\n  +------------+-------------------+----------------+\r\n  | Reference. | Wild-type         | Wild-type      ~\r\n  |            | [female][female]. | [male][male].  ~\r\n  +------------+-------------------+----------------+\r\n  |  4I        |         66        |       43       |\r\n  |            |                   |                |\r\n  +------------+-------------------+----------------+\r\n\r\n  +------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n  |               Second generation.                                 |\r\n  +------------+-------------------+----------------+----------------+\r\n  ~ Reference. | Wild-type         | Wild-type      | Fused          |\r\n  ~            | [female][female]. | [male][male].  | [male][male].  |\r\n  +------------+-------------------+----------------+----------------+\r\n  |  190C      |        258        |       96       |       115      |\r\n  |   14I      |        239        |      105       |        90      |\r\n  |            +-------------------+----------------+----------------+\r\n  |  Total     |        497        |      201       |       205      |\r\n  +------------+-------------------+----------------+----------------+\r\n\r\nThe reciprocal cross was tried many times, but is impossible, owing to the\r\nsterility of the females. Since the fused females are sterile to fused\r\nmales, the stock is kept up by breeding heterozygous females to fused\r\nmales.\r\n\r\nBy means of the following experiments the position of fused in the X\r\nchromosome was determined. A preliminary test was made by mating with\r\neosin, whose factor lies near the left end of the X chromosome series.\r\n\r\nLINKAGE OF EOSIN AND FUSED.\r\n\r\nFused (red-eyed) males mated to eosin (not-fused) females gave wild-type\r\ndaughters and eosin sons, which inbred gave the classes shown in table 33.\r\n\r\nTABLE 33.--_P_1 eosin [female][female] x fused [male][male].

The latter position is improbable, since\r\neosin already lies very near the extreme left end of the known series.\r\nTherefore, since 43 per cent would place the factor nearly at the right end\r\nof the series, the next step was to test its relation to a factor like bar\r\nthat lies at the right end of the chromosome. By mating to bar alone we\r\ncould only get the linkage to bar without discovering on which side of bar\r\nthe new factor lies, but by mating to a fly that carries still another\r\nsex-linked factor, known to lie to the left of bar, the information gained\r\nshould show the relative order of the factors involved. Furthermore, since,\r\nby making a back-cross, both males and females give the same kind of data\r\n(and need not be separated), the experiment was made in this way. In order\r\nto have material for such an experiment double mutant stocks of vermilion\r\nfused and also of bar fused were made up.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. D.--_a_, normal wing; _b_ and _c_, fused wings. _c_\r\nshows a typical fused wing. The most striking feature is the closure of the\r\ncell between the third and fourth longitudinal veins with the elimination\r\nof the cross-vein; the veins at the base of the wing differ from those in\r\nthe normal shown in a. _b_ shows the normal position in which the fused\r\nwings are held. The fusion of the veins in _b_ is unusually complete.]\r\n\r\n{55}\r\n\r\nLINKAGE OF VERMILION, BAR, AND FUSED.\r\n\r\nMales from the stock of (red) bar fused were mated to vermilion (not-bar,\r\nnot-fused) females, and produced bar females and vermilion males. The bar\r\nF_1 daughters were back-crossed to vermilion fused males and produced the\r\nclasses of offspring shown in table 34.\r\n\r\nTABLE 34.--P_1 _vermilion_ [female] [female] x _bar fused_ [male] [male].\r\n_B.

This is the furthest point yet obtained to the right. The reasons for\r\nlocating fused to the right of bar are that, if it occupies such a\r\nposition, then the double cross-over classes (which are expected to be the\r\nsmallest classes) should be vermilion bar and fused, and these are, in\r\nfact, the smallest classes. The order of factors is, then, vermilion, bar,\r\nfused. This order is confirmed by the result that the number of cross-overs\r\nbetween fused and vermilion is greater than that between bar and vermilion.\r\n\r\nIn order to obtain data to balance viability effects, the following\r\nexperiment was made:\r\n\r\nVermilion (not-bar) fused males were bred to (red) bar (not-fused) females.\r\nThe daughters and sons were bar. The daughters were back-crossed, singly,\r\nto vermilion fused males and gave the results shown in table 35. Each\r\nfemale was also transferred to a second culture bottle, so that for each\r\nfemale there are two broods given consecutively (82, 82', etc.) in table\r\n35.\r\n\r\nThe results given by the two broods of the same female are similar.

In this mutation\r\n(text-fig. E) the first of several which affect the shape and distribution\r\nof the bristles, the macrochaetae, instead of {58} being long, slender, and\r\ntapered (see Plate 1, fig. I), are greatly shortened and crinkled as though\r\nscorched. The ends are forked or branched, bent sharply, or merely\r\nthickened. The bristles which are most distorted are those upon the\r\nscutellum, where they are sometimes curled together into balls.\r\n\r\nLINKAGE OF VERMILION AND FORKED.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. E.--Forked bristles.]\r\n\r\nSince forked arose in vermilion stock, the double recessive for these two\r\nsex-linked factors could be used in testing the linkage relations of the\r\nmutation. Vermilion forked males were crossed to wild females and gave\r\nwild-type males and females, which inbred gave in F_2 the results shown in\r\ntable 39. Forked reappeared only in the males in the following proportion:\r\nnot-forked [female], 742; not-forked [male], 346; forked [male], 301. The\r\nresult shows that the character is a sex-linked recessive.\r\n\r\nTABLE 39.--_P_1 wild_ [female] [female] x _vermilion-forked_ [male] [male].\r\n_F_1 wild-type_ [female] [female] x _F_1 wild-type_ [male] [male].\r\n\r\n  +----------+----------+----------------+---------------+--------+-------+\r\n  |          |          | Non-cross-over | Cross-over    |        |       |\r\n  |          |Wild-type | [male] [male]. | [male] [male].| Total  |Cross- |\r\n  |Reference.|[female]  +--------+-------+-------+-------+ [male] | over  |\r\n  |          |[female]. |  Ver-  |Wild-  | Ver-  |Forked.| [male].|values.|\r\n  |          |          | milion |type.  |milion.|       |        |       |\r\n  |          |          | forked.|       |       |       |        |       |\r\n  +----------+----------+--------+-------+-------+-------+--------+-------+\r\n  |  9 I     | 366      | 113    | 123   |  49   |  41   | 326    | 28    |\r\n  | 11 I     | 376      | 116    | 150   |  42   |  31   | 339    | 22    |\r\n  |          +----------+--------+-------+-------+-------+--------+-------+\r\n  |    Total.| 742      | 229    | 273   |  91   |  72   | 665    | 25    |\r\n  +----------+----------+--------+-------+-------+-------+--------+-------+\r\n\r\nIn table 39 vermilion forked and wild-type are non-cross-overs, and\r\nvermilion and forked are cross-overs, giving a cross-over value of 25\r\nunits. The locus, therefore, is 25 units to the right or to the left of\r\nvermilion, that is, either about 58 or 8 units from the yellow locus.\r\n\r\nLINKAGE OF CHERRY AND FORKED.\r\n\r\nForked males were crossed to cherry females (cherry has the same locus as\r\nwhite, which is about 1 unit from yellow) and gave wild-type females and\r\ncherry males. These gave in F_2 the results shown in table 40. The\r\nnon-cross-overs (cherry and forked) plus the cross-overs (cherry forked and\r\nwild type) divided into the cross-overs give a cross-over value of 46\r\nunits, which shows that the locus lies to the right of vermilion, because\r\nif it had been to the left, the value would have been 8 (_i. e._, 33-25)\r\ninstead of 33+25=58. The difference between 58 {59} and 46 is due to the\r\nexpected amount of double crossing-over. In fact, for a distance as long as\r\n58 an almost independent behavior of linked gens is to be expected.\r\n\r\nTABLE 40.--_P_{1} cherry_ [female] [female] x _forked_ [male] [male].\r\n_F_{1} wild-type_ [female] [female] x _F_{1} cherry_ [male] [male].\r\n\r\n  +----------+--------------+---------------+-------------+-------+-------+\r\n  |Reference.|   Females.   | Non-cross-over|  Cross-over |       |       |\r\n  |          |              | [male] [male].|[male] [male]| Total |Cross- |\r\n  |          +-------+------+-------+-------+-------+-----+[male] | over  |\r\n  |          |Cherry.| Wild-|Cherry.|Forked.|Cherry |Wild-|[male].|values.|\r\n  |          |       | type.|       |       |forked.|type.|       |       |\r\n  +----------+-------+------+-------+-------+-------+-----+-------+-------+\r\n  | 25       |   129 |  145 |   73  |   70  |  65   |  68 |  276  |  48   |\r\n  | 25'      |   167 |  148 |   74  |   82  |  66   |  88 |  310  |  50   |\r\n  | 36       |    96 |   88 |   52  |   52  |  35   |  51 |  190  |  45   |\r\n  | 36'      |    57 |   76 |   41  |   32  |  24   |  30 |  127  |  43   |\r\n  | 84       |    76 |   86 |   40  |   34  |  38   |  26 |  138  |  46   |\r\n  | 84'      |    62 |   71 |   24  |   39  |  25   |  28 |  116  |  46   |\r\n  | 85       |   114 |   86 |   43  |   78  |  41   |  53 |  215  |  44   |\r\n  | 85'      |    98 |   95 |   48  |   63  |  52   |  46 |  209  |  47   |\r\n  | 86       |   307 |  323 |  152  |  144  | 118   | 165 |  579  |  49   |\r\n  | 87       |   351 |  341 |  183  |  213  | 160   | 147 |  703  |  45   |\r\n  | 88       |   244 |  246 |  142  |  142  | 107   | 104 |  495  |  43   |\r\n  +----------+-------+------+-------+-------+-------+-----+-------+-------+\r\n  |Total.    | 1,701 |1,705 |  872  |  949  | 731   | 806 |3,358  |  46   |\r\n  +----------+-------+------+-------+-------+-------+-----+-------+-------+\r\n\r\nLINKAGE OF FORKED, BAR, AND FUSED.\r\n\r\nThis value of 58 gave the furthest locus to the right obtained up to that\r\ntime, since forked is slightly beyond rudimentary.

The order of factors is rudimentary, forked, bar. On\r\nthe basis of the total data the locus of forked is at 56.5. {62}\r\n\r\nSHIFTED.\r\n\r\nShifted appeared (January 1913) in a stock culture of vermilion dot. The\r\nchief characteristic of this mutant is that the third longitudinal vein\r\n(see text-fig. F) does not reach the margin as it does in the normal fly.\r\nThe vein is displaced toward the fourth throughout its length, and only\r\nvery rarely does it extend far enough to join the marginal vein. The\r\ncross-vein between the third and the fourth veins is often absent because\r\nof the shifting. The flies themselves are smaller than normal. The wings\r\nare held out from the body at a wide angle. The two posterior bristles of\r\nthe scutellum are much reduced in size and stick straight up--a useful\r\nlandmark by which just-hatched shifted flies may be recognized, even though\r\nthe wings are not expanded.\r\n\r\nLINKAGE OF SHIFTED AND VERMILION.\r\n\r\nSince shifted arose in vermilion, the double recessive shifted vermilion\r\nwas available for the following linkage experiment: shifted vermilion males\r\nby wild females gave wild-type males and females which inbred gave the data\r\nshown in table 46.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. F.--Shifted venation. The third longitudinal vein is\r\nshifted toward the fourth and fails to reach the margin. Cross-vein between\r\nthird and fourth longitudinal veins is lacking.]\r\n\r\nDisregarding the eye-color, the following is a summary of the preceding\r\nresults: wild-type [female], 1,001; wild-type [male], 437; shifted [male],\r\n328. The result shows that shifted is a sex-linked recessive. The data of\r\ntable 46 show that the locus of shifted lies about 15 units on one side or\r\nthe other of vermilion, which from the calculated position of vermilion at\r\n33 would give a position for shifted at either 18 or 48 from yellow.\r\n\r\nTABLE 46.--_P_1 shifted vermilion [male] [male] x wild [female] [female].\r\nF_1 wild-type [female] x F_1 wild-type [male] [male]._\r\n\r\n  Key to columns:\r\n\r\n  A:  Wild-type [female] [female].\r\n  B:  Non-cross-over [male] [male], Shifted.\r\n  C:  Non-cross-over [male] [male], Wild-type.\r\n  D:  Cross-over [male] [male], Shifted.\r\n  E:  Cross-over [male] [male], Wild-type.\r\n  F:  Total [male] [male].\r\n  G:  Cross-over values.\r\n\r\n  +--------------+---------+------+------+-------+-------+-------+------+\r\n  | Reference.   |     A   |  B   |  C   |  D    |  E    |   F   |  G   |\r\n  +--------------+---------+------+------+-------+-------+-------+------+\r\n  | 13           |    345  |  79  | 115  |   8   |  25   |  227  |  15  |\r\n  | 29           |     68  |  20  |  32  |   3   |   4   |   59  |  12  |\r\n  | 30           |    191  |  37  |  54  |   5   |  13   |  109  |  17  |\r\n  | 31           |    151  |  41  |  65  |  17   |  13   |  136  |  22  |\r\n  | 33           |    133  |  49  |  40  |   4   |   6   |   99  |  10  |\r\n  | 34           |    113  |  56  |  59  |   9   |  11   |  135  |  15  |\r\n  +--------------+---------+------+------+-------+-------+-------+------+\r\n  |  Total.      |   1,001 | 282  |  365 |   46  |   72  |  765  |  15  |\r\n  +--------------+---------+------+------+-------+-------+-------+------+\r\n\r\n{63}\r\n\r\nLINKAGE OF SHIFTED, VERMILION, AND BAR.\r\n\r\nIn order to determine on which side of vermilion shifted lies, a shifted\r\nvermilion (not-bar) female was crossed to a (not-shifted red) bar male.\r\nThree factors are involved, of which one, bar, is dominant. The shifted\r\nvermilion (not-bar) stock is a triple recessive, and a three-point\r\nback-cross was therefore possible. The daughters were bar and the sons were\r\nshifted vermilion (the triple recessive). Inbred these gave the results\r\nshown in table 46. The smallest classes (double cross-overs) are shifted\r\nand vermilion bar, which places shifted to the left of vermilion at\r\napproximately 17.8 units from yellow.\r\n\r\nTABLE 47.--_P_1 shifted vermilion_ [female] x _bar_ [male] [male]. _F_1\r\nbar_ [female] x _F_1 shifted vermillion_ [male] [male].\r\n\r\n  +-------+---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+\r\n  |       |    s_h  v     |    s_h  B'    |   s_h v B'    |    s_h        |\r\n  | Refer-|    ------     |    --+----    |    -----+-    |    --+-+--    |\r\n  | ence. |        B'     |       v       |               |       v B'    |\r\n  |       +----------+----+--------+------+---------+-----+--------+------+\r\n  |       |Shifted   |Bar.|Shifted |Verm- |Shifted  |Wild-|Shifted.| Verm-~\r\n  |       |vermilion.|    |  bar.  |ilion.|vermilion|type.|        | ilion~\r\n  |       |          |    |        |      |bar.     |     |        | bar. |\r\n  +-------+----------+----+--------+------+---------+-----+--------+------+\r\n  |  65   |  56      |108 |   15   |  20  |  8      | 33  |  1     |  1   |\r\n  +-------+----------+----+--------+------+---------+-----+--------+------+\r\n\r\n  +----------+------+----------------------------+\r\n  |          |      |                            |\r\n  |Reference.|Total.| Cross-over values.         |\r\n  |          |      |                            |\r\n  |          |      +----------+---------+-------+\r\n  ~          |      |Shifted   |Vermilion|Shifted|\r\n  ~          |      |vermilion.|bar.     |bar.   |\r\n  |          |      |          |         |       |\r\n  +----------+------+----------+---------+-------+\r\n  | 65       | 242  |  15      | 18      |  31   |\r\n  +----------+------+----------+---------+-------+\r\n\r\nThe stock of shifted has been thrown away, since too great difficulty was\r\nencountered in maintaining it, because, apparently, of sterility in the\r\nfemales.\r\n\r\nLETHALS SA AND SB.\r\n\r\nThe first lethal found by Miss Rawls was in a stock that had been bred for\r\nabout 3 years. While there was no _a priori_ reason that could be given to\r\nsupport the view that lethal mutations would occur more frequently among\r\nflies inbred in confinement, nevertheless a hundred females from each of\r\nseveral newly caught and from each of several confined stocks were examined\r\nfor lethals (Stark, 1915). No lethals were found among the wild stocks, but\r\n4 were found among the confined stocks. Whether this difference is\r\nsignificant is perhaps open to question. The first lethal was found in\r\nJanuary 1913, in a stock that had been caught at Falmouth, Massachusetts,\r\nin 1911, and had been inbred for 18 months, _i.e._, for about 50\r\ngenerations. This lethal, lethal _sa_, was recessive and behaved like the\r\nformer lethals, being transmitted by half the females and causing the death\r\nof half the sons. The position of this lethal to the X chromosome was found\r\nas follows, by means of the cross-over value white lethal _sa_.\r\nLethal-bearing females were mated to white males and the lethal-bearing\r\ndaughters were again mated to white males. The white sons (894) were\r\nnon-cross-overs and the red sons (256) were cross-overs. The percentage of\r\ncrossing-over {64} is 22.2. A correction of 0.4 unit should be added for\r\ndouble crossing-over, indicating that the locus is 22.6 units from white,\r\nor at 23.7.\r\n\r\nWhen the work on lethal _sa_ had been continued for 3 months, the second\r\nlethal, lethal _sb_, was found (April 1913) to be present in a female which\r\nwas already heterozygous for lethal _sa_. It is probable that this second\r\nlethal arose as a mutation in the father, and that a sperm whose X carried\r\nlethal _sb_ fertilized an egg whose X carried lethal _sa_. As in the cases\r\nof lethals 1 and 1_a_ and lethals 3 and 3_a_, this lethal, lethal _sb_, was\r\ndiscovered from the fact that only a very few sons were produced, there\r\nbeing 82 daughters and only 3 sons. If, as in the other cases, the number\r\nof daughters is taken as the number of non-cross-overs and twice the number\r\nof sons as the cross-overs, it is found that the two lethals are about 7\r\nunits apart. Since the two lethals were in different X chromosomes, all the\r\ndaughters should receive one or the other lethal, except in those few cases\r\nin which crossing over had taken place. Of the daughters 19 were tested and\r\nevery one was found to carry a lethal. Again, if the cross-over values of\r\nthe lethals with some other character, such as white eyes, be found and\r\nplotted, the curve should show two modes corresponding to the two lethals.\r\nThis test was applied, but the curve failed to show two modes clearly,[7]\r\nthe two lethals being too close together to be differentiated by the small\r\nnumber of determinations that were made. It seems probable that lethal _sa_\r\nand lethal _sb_ are about 5 units apart.\r\n\r\nThe position of lethal _sb_ was accurately found by continuing the\r\ndeterminations with a white lethal cross-over. A white female was found\r\nwhich had only one of the two lethals and the linkage of this lethal with\r\neosin and miniature was found as follows: A female carrying white and\r\nlethal in one chromosome and no mutant factor in the homologous chromosome\r\nwas bred to an eosin miniature male. The white eosin daughters carried\r\nlethal, and their sons show the amount of crossing-over between white and\r\nlethal (15.6), between lethal and miniature (19.9), and between white and\r\nminiature (32.9). The data on which these calculations are based are given\r\nin table 48.\r\n\r\nTABLE 48.--_Data on the linkage of white, lethal sb, and miniature, from\r\nStark, 1915_.\r\n\r\n  +-----------+------------+------------+--------------+\r\n  | w^e     m | w^e l_{sb} | w^e        | w^e l_{sb} m |\r\n  | --------- | ---+------ | -------+-- | ---+-----+-- |\r\n  | w l_{sb}  | w        m | w l_{sb} m | w            |\r\n  |           |            |            |              |\r\n  +-----------+------------+------------+--------------+\r\n  | Eosin     | White      | Eosin.     | White.       ~\r\n  | miniature | miniature. |            |              ~\r\n  |           |            |            |              |\r\n  +-----------+------------+------------+--------------+\r\n  | 2,421     | 524        | 685        | 48           |\r\n  +-----------+------------+------------+--------------+\r\n\r\n  +--------+--------------------------------+\r\n  |        |                                |\r\n  |        |       Cross-over values.       |\r\n  |        |                                |\r\n  |        |                                |\r\n  | Total. +----------+----------+----------+\r\n  ~        |White     |Lethal    |White     |\r\n  ~        |lethal    |_sb_      |miniature.|\r\n  |        |_sb_.     |miniature.|          |\r\n  +--------+----------+----------+----------+\r\n  | 3,678  | 15.6     | 19.9     | 32.9     |\r\n  +--------+----------+----------+----------+\r\n\r\n{65}\r\n\r\nThe locus of this lethal is at 16.7; the locus of lethal _sa_ was found to\r\nbe at 23.7, so that the lethal at 16.7 is evidently the second lethal or\r\nlethal _sb_ whose advent gave rise to the high sex-ratio. This\r\ninterpretation is in accord with the curve which Miss Stark published, for\r\nalthough the mode which corresponds to lethal _sa_ is weak, the mode at\r\n15-16 is well marked.\r\n\r\nThe two other lethals, lethals _sc_ and _sd_, which came up in the course\r\nof these experiments by Miss Stark, are treated in other sections of this\r\npaper.\r\n\r\nBAR.\r\n\r\n(Plate II, figures 12 and 13.)\r\n\r\nThe dominant sex-linked mutant called bar-eye (formerly called barred)\r\nappeared in February 1913 in an experiment involving rudimentary and\r\nlong-winged flies (Tice, 1914). A female that is heterozygous for bar has\r\nan eye that is intermediate between the rounded eye of the wild fly and the\r\nnarrow band of the bar stock. This heterozygous bar female is always\r\nreadily distinguishable from the normal, but can not always be separated\r\nfrom the pure bar. Bar is therefore nearly always used as a dominant and\r\nback-crosses are made with normal males.\r\n\r\nBar is the most useful sex-linked character so far discovered, on account\r\nof its dominance, the certainty of its classification, and its position\r\nnear the right end of the X chromosome. The locus of bar at 57 was\r\ndetermined on the basis of the data of table 65.\r\n\r\nNOTCH.\r\n\r\nA sex-linked dominant factor that brings about a notch at the ends of the\r\nwings appeared in March 1913, and has been described and figured by Dexter\r\n(1914, p. 753, and fig. 13, p. 730). The factor acts as a lethal for the\r\nmale. Consequently a female heterozygous for notch bred to a wild male\r\ngives a 2:1 sex-ratio; half of her daughters are notch and half normal; the\r\nsons are only normal. The actual figures obtained by Dexter were 235 notch\r\nfemales, 270 normal females, and 235 normal males.\r\n\r\nThe location of notch in the X chromosome was not determined by Dexter, but\r\nthe mutant has appeared anew three or four times and the position has been\r\nfound by Bridges to be approximately at 2.6. {66}\r\n\r\nDEPRESSED.\r\n\r\nSeveral mutations have appeared in which the wings are not flat. Of these\r\nthe first that appeared was curved (second chromosome), in which the wings\r\nare curved downward throughout their length, but are elevated and held out\r\nsidewise from the body; the texture is thinner than normal. The second of\r\nthese wing mutants to appear was jaunty (second chromosome), in which the\r\nwings turn up sharply at the tip; they lie in the normal position. The\r\nthird mutant, arc (second chromosome), has, as its name implies, its wings\r\ncurved like the arc of a circle. The fourth mutant, bow (first chromosome,\r\nfig. C), is like arc, but the amount of curvature is slightly less. The\r\nfifth mutant, depressed (first chromosome, fig. G), has the tip of its\r\nwings turned down instead of up, as in jaunty, but, as in jaunty, the wing\r\nis straight, except near the tip, where it bends suddenly. These stocks\r\nhave been kept separate since their origin, and flies from them have seldom\r\nbeen crossed to each other, because in the succeeding generations it would\r\nbe almost impossible to make a satisfactory classification of the various\r\ntypes. But that they are genetically different mutations is at once shown\r\non crossing any two, when wild-type offspring are produced. For instance,\r\nbow and arc are the two most nearly alike. Mated together (bow [male] by\r\narc [female]), they give in F_1 straight-winged flies which inbred give in\r\nF_2 9 straight to 7 not-straight (_i.e._, bow, arc, and bow arc together).\r\n\r\nDepressed wings first appeared (April 1913) among the males of a culture of\r\nblack flies. They were mated to their sisters and from subsequent\r\ngenerations both males and females with depressed wings were obtained which\r\ngave a pure stock. This new character proved to be another sex-linked\r\nrecessive.\r\n\r\nLINKAGE OF DEPRESSED AND BAR.\r\n\r\nDepressed (not-bar) males mated to (not-depressed) bar females gave bar\r\ndaughters. Two of these were back-crossed singly to depressed males and\r\ngave the results shown in table 49. Males and females were not separated,\r\nsince they should give the same result.\r\n\r\nTABLE 49.--_P_1 depressed_ [female] [female] x _bar_ [female] [female].\r\n_B.C.

G.--Depressed wing.]\r\n\r\nLINKAGE OF CHERRY, DEPRESSED, AND VERMILION.\r\n\r\nThe linkage value 38 (see table 49) indicates that depressed is somewhere\r\nnear the opposite end of the series of sex-linked factors from bar. The\r\nlocus could be more accurately determined by finding the linkage relations\r\nof depressed with gens at its end of the chromosome. Accordingly, depressed\r\nfemales were crossed to cherry vermilion males. F_1 gave wild-type females\r\nand depressed males. The daughters bred again to cherry vermilion males\r\ngave the results shown in table 50. The data only suffice to show that the\r\nlocus of depressed is about midway between cherry and vermilion, or at\r\nabout 15 units from yellow.\r\n\r\nThe F_1 males in the last experiment did not have their wings as much\r\ndepressed as is the condition in stock males, and in F_2 most of the\r\ndepressed winged males were of the F_1 type, although a few were like those\r\nof stock. This result suggests that the stock is a double recessive,\r\n_i. e._, one that contains, in addition to the sex-linked depressed, an\r\nautosomal factor that intensifies the effect of the primary sex-linked\r\nfactor.\r\n\r\nTABLE 50.--_P_1 depressed [female] x cherry vermilion [male] [male]._\r\n\r\n  +-------------------++---------------------------------------+\r\n  |                   ||             Second generation.        |\r\n  |       First       |+----------+--------+-------------------+\r\n  |    generation.    ||          |        |       w^c  v      |\r\n  +---------|---------+|          |        |      -------      |\r\n  |         |         ||          |        |        d_p        |\r\n  |  Wild-  |Depressed||          |        +---------+---------+\r\n  |  type   | [male]  ||Reference.|        |         |         ~\r\n  |[female] | [male]. ||          |[female]|Cherry   |         ~\r\n  |[female].|         ||          |[female]|vermilion|Depressed|\r\n  |         |         ||          |        |         |         |\r\n  |         |         ||          |        | [male]. | [male]. |\r\n  +---------+---------++----------+--------+---------+---------+\r\n  |   21    |    31   ||     19 I |   59   |     23  |   24    |\r\n  +---------+---------++----------+--------+---------+---------+\r\n\r\n  +---------------------------------------------------------+\r\n  |                  Second generation.                     |\r\n  +-------------------+-------------------------------------+\r\n  |     w^c d_p       |     w^c          |    w^c d_p  v    |\r\n  |     --+-----      |     -----+--     |   --+----+---    |\r\n  |            v      |       d_p  v     |                  |\r\n  +---------+---------+--------+---------+---------+--------|\r\n  ~         |         |        |         |         |        |\r\n  ~ Cherry  |         | Cherry |Depressed|Cherry   | Wild-  |\r\n  |depressed|Vermilion|        |vermilion|depressed| type   |\r\n  |         |         |        |         |vermilion|        |\r\n  | [male]. |[male].  |[male]. | [male]. | [male]. | [male].|\r\n  +---------+---------+--------+---------+---------+--------+\r\n  |    6    |    6    |   5    |    5    |      0  |    0   |\r\n  +---------+---------+--------+---------+---------+--------+\r\n\r\n{68}\r\n\r\nCLUB.\r\n\r\nIn May 1913 there were observed in a certain stock some flies which,\r\nalthough mature, did not unfold their wings (text-fig. H_a_). This\r\ncondition was at first found only in males and suspicion was aroused that\r\nthe character might be sex-linked. When these males were bred to wild\r\nfemales the club-shaped wings reappeared only in the F_2 males, but in\r\nsmaller number than expected for a recessive sex-linked character. The\r\nresult led to the further suspicion that not all those individuals that are\r\ngenetically club show club somatically. These points are best illustrated\r\nand proven by the following history of the stock:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. H.--Club wing. _a_ shows the unexpanded wings of club\r\nflies; _c_ shows the absence of the two large bristles from the side of the\r\nthorax present in the normal condition of the wild, b.]\r\n\r\nClub females were obtained by breeding F_2 club males to their F_2\r\nlong-winged sisters, half of which should be heterozygous for club. {69}\r\n5,352; wild-type [male], 4,181; club [male], 236. The wild-type males\r\ninclude, of course, those club males that have expanded wings (potential\r\nclubs).\r\n\r\nClub females by wild males gave in the F_2 generation (mass cultures):\r\nwild-type [female], 1,131; wild-type [male], 897; club [female], 57; club\r\n[male], 131.\r\n\r\nIt is noticeable that there were fewer club females than club males,\r\nequality being expected, which might appear to indicate that the club\r\ncondition is more often realized by the male than by the female, but later\r\ncrosses show that the difference here is not a constant feature of the\r\ncross.\r\n\r\nLong-winged males from club stock (potential clubs) bred to wild females\r\ngave in F_2 the following: wild-type [female], 521; wild-type (and\r\npotential club) [male], 403; club [male], 82.\r\n\r\nClub females by club males of club stock gave in F_2: potential club\r\n[female], 126; potential club [male], 78; club [female], 95; club [male],\r\n81. These results are from 8 pairs. The high proportion of club is\r\nnoticeable.\r\n\r\nPotential club females and males from pure club stock (_i. e._, stock\r\nderived originally from a pair of club) gave in F_2 the following:\r\npotential club [female], 1,049; potential club [male], 666; club [female],\r\n450; club [male], 453.\r\n\r\nGENOTYPIC CLUB.\r\n\r\nAccurate work with the club character was made possible by the discovery of\r\na character that is a constant index of the presence of homozygous club.\r\nThis character is the absence of the two large bristles (text-fig. H_c_)\r\nthat are present on each side of the thorax of the wild fly as shown in\r\nfigure Hb. All club flies are now classified by this character and no\r\nattention is paid to whether the wings remain as pads or become expanded.\r\n\r\nLINKAGE OF CLUB AND VERMILION.\r\n\r\nThe linkage of club and vermilion is shown by the cultures listed in table\r\n51, which were obtained as controls in working with lethal III. The\r\ncross-over value is shown in the male classes by the cross-over fraction\r\n276/1463 or 19 per cent.\r\n\r\nLINKAGE OF YELLOW, CLUB, AND VERMILION.\r\n\r\nThe data just given in table 51 show that club is 19 units from vermilion,\r\nbut in order to determine in which direction from vermilion it lies, the\r\ncrossing-over of club to one other gen must be tested. For this test we\r\nused yellow, which lies at the extreme left of the chromosome series. At\r\nthe same time we included vermilion, so that a three-point experiment was\r\nmade.\r\n\r\nFemales that were (gray) club vermilion were bred to yellow (not-club red)\r\nand gave wild-type daughters and club vermilion sons. These inbred gave the\r\nresults of table 52.\r\n\r\nThe data from the males show that the locus of club is about midway between\r\nyellow and vermilion. This conclusion is based on the {70} evidence that\r\nyellow and club give 18 per cent of crossing-over, club and vermilion 20\r\nper cent, and yellow and vermilion 35 per cent. The double cross-overs on\r\nthis view are yellow club (3) and vermilion (3). The females furnish\r\nadditional data for the linkage of club and vermilion. The value calculated\r\nfrom the female classes alone is 20 units, which is the same value as that\r\ngiven by the males.\r\n\r\nTABLE 51.--_P_1 club_ [female] [female] x _vermilion_ [male] [male].

VERMILION.\r\n\r\nThe need for a readily workable character whose gen should lie in the long\r\nspace between cherry and vermilion has long been felt. Cherry and vermilion\r\nare so far apart that there must be considerable double crossing-over\r\nbetween them. But with no favorably placed character which is at the same\r\ntime viable and clearly and rapidly distinguishable, we were unable to find\r\nthe exact amount of double crossing-over, and hence could not make a proper\r\ncorrection in plotting the chromosome. Club occupies just this favorable\r\nposition nearly midway between cherry and vermilion. The distances from\r\ncherry to club and from club to vermilion are short enough so that no error\r\nwould be introduced if we ignored the small amount of double crossing-over\r\nwithin each of these distances.\r\n\r\nIt thus becomes important to know very exactly the cross-over values for\r\ncherry club and club vermilion. The experiment has the form of the yellow\r\nclub vermilion cross of table 52, except that cherry is used instead of\r\nyellow. Cherry is better than yellow because it is slightly nearer club\r\nthan is yellow and because the bristles of yellow flies are very\r\ninconspicuous. In yellow flies the bristles on the side of the thorax are\r\nyellowish brown against a yellow background, while in gray-bodied flies the\r\nbristles are very black against a light yellowish-gray background.\r\n\r\nFor the time being we are able to present only incomplete results upon this\r\ncross. In the first experiment cherry females were crossed to club\r\nvermilion males and the wild-type daughters were back-crossed to cherry\r\nclub vermilion, which triple recessive had been secured for this purpose.\r\nTable 53 gives the results.\r\n\r\nTABLE 53.--_P_{1} cherry_ [female] [female] x _club vermilion_ [male]\r\n[male]. _B.

All the data thus far presented upon club vermilion (886 cross-overs\r\nin a total of 4,681), give 19.2 as the value for club vermilion. The locus\r\nof club on the basis of the total data available is at 14.6.\r\n\r\nGREEN.\r\n\r\nIn May 1913 there appeared in a culture of flies with gray body-color a few\r\nmales with a greenish-black tinge to the body and legs. The trident pattern\r\non the thorax, which is almost invisible in many wild flies, was here quite\r\nmarked. A green male was mated to wild females and gave in F_2 a close\r\napproach to a 2:1:1 ratio. The green reappeared only in the F_2 males, but\r\nthe separation of green from gray was not as easy or complete as desirable.\r\nFrom subsequent generations a pure stock of green was made. A green female\r\nby wild male gave 138 wild-type females and 127 males which were greenish.\r\nThis green color varies somewhat in depth, so that some of these F_1 males\r\ncould not have been separated with certainty from a mixed culture of green\r\nand gray males.\r\n\r\nThe results of these two experiments show that green is a sex-linked\r\nmelanistic character like sable, but the somatic difference produced is\r\nmuch less than in the case of sable, so that the new mutation, although\r\ngenetically definite, is of little practical value. We have found several\r\neye-colors which differed from the red color of the wild fly by very small\r\ndifferences. With some of these we have worked successfully by using\r\nanother eye-color as a developer. For example, the double recessive\r\nvermilion \"clear\" is far more easily distinguished from vermilion than is\r\nclear from red. But it is no small task to make up the stocks {73}\r\nnecessary for such a special study. In the case of green we might perhaps\r\nhave employed a similar method, performing all experiments with a common\r\ndifference from the gray in all flies used.\r\n\r\nCHROME.\r\n\r\nIn a stock of forked fused there appeared, September 15, 1913, three males\r\nof a brownish-yellow body-color. They were uniform in color, without any of\r\nthe abdominal banding so striking in other body-colors. Even the tip of the\r\nabdomen lacked the heavy pigmentation which is a marked secondary sexual\r\ncharacter of the male. About 20 or more of these males appeared in the same\r\nculture. This appearance of many males showing a mutant character and the\r\nnon-appearance of corresponding females is usual for sex-linked characters.\r\nIn such cases females appear in the next generation, as they did in this\r\ncase when the chrome males were mated to their sisters in mass cultures.\r\nSince both females and males of chrome were on hand, it should have been an\r\neasy matter to continue the stock, but many matings failed, and it was\r\nnecessary to resort to breeding in heterozygous form. The chrome, however,\r\ngradually disappeared from the stock. Such a difficult sex-linked mutation\r\nas this could be successfully handled (like a lethal) if it could be mated\r\nto a double recessive whose members lie one on each side of the mutant, but\r\nin the case of chrome this was not attempted soon enough to save the stock.\r\n\r\nLETHAL 3.\r\n\r\nIn the repetition of a cross between a white miniature male and a vermilion\r\npink male (December 1913), the F_2 ratios among the males were seen to be\r\nvery much distorted because of the partial absence of certain classes\r\n(Morgan 1914_c_). While it was suspected that the disturbance was due to a\r\nlethal, the data were useless for determining the position of such a\r\nlethal, from the fact that more than one mother had been used in each\r\nculture. From an F_2 culture that gave practically a 2:1 sex-ratio,\r\nvermilion females were bred to club males. Several such females gave\r\nsex-ratios. Their daughters were again mated to vermilion males. Half of\r\nthese daughters gave high female sex-ratios and showed the linkage\r\nrelations given in table 55.\r\n\r\nTABLE 55.--_Linkage data on club, lethal 3, and vermilion, from Morgan,\r\n1914c_.\r\n\r\n  +----------+-----------------------------------------------------------+\r\n  |          |                             Males.                        |\r\n  |          +-----------+--------------+------------------+-------------+\r\n  |          |  c_1      |  c_1 l_3 v   |  c_1  v          |  c_1 l_3    |\r\n  | Females. |  -------  |  --+------   |  ----+-          |  --+--+--   |\r\n  |          |    l_3 v  |              |    l_3           |         v   |\r\n  |          +-----------+--------------+------------------+-------------+\r\n  |          |  Club.    |  Wild-type.  |  Club vermilion. |  Vermilion. |\r\n  +----------+-----------+--------------+------------------+-------------+\r\n  |  588     |   182     |    28        |    11            |    1        |\r\n  +----------+-----------+--------------+------------------+-------------+\r\n\r\n{74}\r\n\r\nLethal 3 proved to lie between club and vermilion, 13 units from club and 5\r\nfrom vermilion.

The explanation\r\nadvanced (Morgan 1914_c_) was that the mother of the high ratio was\r\nheterozygous for lethal 3, and also for another lethal that had arisen by\r\nmutation in the X chromosome brought in by the sperm. On this\r\ninterpretation the few males that survived were those that had arisen\r\nthrough crossing-over. The rarity of the sons shows that the two lethals\r\nwere in loci near together, although here of course in different\r\nchromosomes, except when one of them crossed over to the other. As\r\nexplained in the section on lethal 1 and 1_a_ the distance between the two\r\nlethals can be found by taking twice the number of the surviving males\r\n(2+3) as the cross-overs and the number of the females as the\r\nnon-cross-overs. But the 34 daughters tested were also non-cross-overs,\r\nsince none of them failed to carry a lethal. The fractions (6+0)/(71+34) =\r\n6/105 give 5.7 as the distance between the lethals in question. In the case\r\nof lethals 3 and 3_a_ another test was applied which showed graphically\r\nthat two lethals were present. Each of the daughters tested showed, by the\r\nclasses of her sons, the amount of crossing-over between white and that\r\nlethal of the two that she carried. These cross-over values were plotted\r\nand gave a bimodal curve with modes 7 units apart. It had already been\r\nshown that the locus of one of the two lethals was at 26.5, and since the\r\nhigher of the two modes was at about 23, it corresponds to lethal 3. The\r\ndata and the curve show that the lethals 3 and 3_a_ are about 7 units\r\napart, _i. e._, lethal 3_a_ lies at about 19.5. {75}\r\n\r\nLETHAL 1b.\r\n\r\nA cross between yellow white males and abnormal abdomen females gave\r\n(February 1914) regular results in 10 F_2 cultures, but three cultures gave\r\n2 [female] : 1 [male] sex-ratios (Morgan, 1914_b_, p. 92). The yellow white\r\nclass, which was a non-cross-over class in these 10 cultures, had\r\ndisappeared in the 3 cultures. Subsequent work gave the data summarized in\r\ntable 57. At the time when the results of table 57 were obtained it did not\r\nseem possible that two different lethals could be present in the space of\r\nabout 1 unit between yellow and white, and this lethal was thought to be a\r\nreappearance of lethal 1 (Morgan, 1912_b_, p. 92). Since then a large\r\nnumber of lethals have arisen, one of them less than 0.1 unit from yellow,\r\nand at least one other mutation has taken place between yellow and white,\r\nso that the supposition is now rather that the lethal in question was not\r\nlethal 1. Indeed, the linkage data show that this lethal, which may be\r\ncalled lethal 1_b_, lies extraordinarily close to white, for the distance\r\nfrom yellow was 0.8 unit and of white from yellow on the basis of the same\r\ndata 0.8. There was also a total absence of cross-overs between lethal 1_b_\r\nand white in the total of 846 flies which could have shown such\r\ncrossing-over. On the basis of this linkage data alone we should be obliged\r\nto locate lethal 1_b_ at the point at which white itself is situated,\r\nnamely, 1.1, but on _a priori_ grounds it seems improbable that a lethal\r\nmutation has occurred at the same locus as the factor for white eye-color.\r\nFarther evidence against this supposition is that females that have one X\r\nchromosome with both yellow and white and the other X chromosome with\r\nyellow, lethal, and white are exactly like regular stock yellow white\r\nflies. The lethal must have appeared in a chromosome which was already\r\ncarrying white and yet did not affect the character of the white. We\r\nprefer, therefore, to locate lethal 1_b_ at 1.1-.\r\n\r\nTABLE 57.--_Summary of all linkage data upon lethal 1b, from Morgan,\r\n1914b_.\r\n\r\n  +-------------------------+---------+--------+---------------+\r\n  |     Gens.               |  Total. | Cross- | Cross-over    |\r\n  |                         |         | overs. | values.       |\r\n  +-------------------------+---------+--------+---------------+\r\n  | Yellow lethal 1_b_      |   744   |   6    |  0.81         |\r\n  | Yellow white            | 2,787   |  23    |  0.82         |\r\n  | Lethal 1_b_ white       |   846   |   0    |  0.0          |\r\n  +-------------------------+---------+--------+---------------+\r\n\r\nFACET.\r\n\r\nSeveral autosomal mutations had been found in which the facets of the\r\ncompound eye are disarranged. One that was sex-linked appeared in February\r\n1914. Under the low power of the binocular microscope the facets are seen\r\nto be irregular in arrangement, instead of being arranged in a strictly\r\nregular pattern. The ommatidia are more nearly circular than hexagonal in\r\noutline, and are variable in size, some being considerably larger than\r\nnormal. The large ones are also darker than {76} the smaller, giving a\r\nblotched appearance to the eye. The short hairs between the facets point in\r\nall directions instead of radially, as in the normal eye. The irregular\r\nreflection breaks up the dark fleck which is characteristic of the normal\r\neye. The shape of the eye differs somewhat from the normal; it is more\r\nconvex, smaller, and is encircled by a narrow rim destitute of ommatidia.\r\n\r\nFacet arose in a back-cross to test the independence of speck (second\r\nchromosome) and maroon (third chromosome). One of the cultures produced,\r\namong the first males to hatch, some males which showed the facet\r\ndisarrangement. None of the females showed this character. The complete\r\noutput was that typical of a female heterozygous for a recessive sex-linked\r\ncharacter: not-facet [female] [female] (2), 112; not-facet [male] [male]\r\n(1), 57; facet [male] [male] (1), 51.\r\n\r\nOf the three characters which were shown by the F_2 males, one, facet, is\r\nsex-linked, another, speck, is in the second chromosome, and maroon is in\r\nthe third chromosome. All eight F_2 classes are therefore expected to be\r\nequal in size, and each pair of characters should show free assortment,\r\nthat is, 50 per cent. The assortment value for facet speck is 48, for speck\r\nmaroon 52, and for facet maroon 48, as calculated from the F_2 males of\r\ntable 58.\r\n\r\nTABLE 58.--_P_1 speck maroon_ [male] x _wild_ [female] [female]. _B.C.

Three of the wild-type daughters were back-crossed to\r\nvermilion sable males. The females of the next generation should give data\r\nupon the linkage of vermilion and sable, while the males should show the\r\nlinkage of all three gens, facet, vermilion, and sable. The offspring of\r\nthese three females are classified in table 59.\r\n\r\nThe cross-over fraction for vermilion sable as calculated from the females\r\nis 19/194. The cross-over value corresponding to this fraction is 10 units,\r\nwhich was the value found in the more extensive experiments given in the\r\nsection on sable.\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that the results in the males of culture 150 are\r\nmarkedly different from those of the other two pairs. While the sable males\r\nare fully represented, their opposite classes, the gray males, are {77}\r\nentirely absent. This result is due to a lethal factor, lethal 5, which\r\nappeared in this culture for the first time.\r\n\r\nThe males of the two cultures 149 and 151 give the order of gens as facet,\r\nvermilion, sable; that is, facet lies to the left of vermilion and toward\r\nyellow. The cross-over values are: facet vermilion 40; vermilion sable 12;\r\nfacet sable 42. Since yellow and vermilion usually give but 34 per cent of\r\ncrossing-over, this large value of 40 for facet vermilion shows that facet\r\nmust lie very near to yellow.\r\n\r\nTABLE 59.--_P_1 facet_ [male] x _vermilion sable_ [female] [female]. _B.C.\r\nF_1 wild-type_ [female] x _vermilion sable_ [male] [male].\r\n\r\n  +----------+----------------------------------+\r\n  |          |           F_2 females.           |\r\n  |          +----------------+-----------------+\r\n  |          |                |                 |\r\n  |          |Non-cross-overs.|   Cross-overs.  |\r\n  |          |                |                 |\r\n  |Reference.+---------+------+----------+------+\r\n  |          |Vermilion|Wild- |Vermilion.|Sable.|\r\n  |          |sable.   |type. |          |      ~\r\n  |          |         |      |          |      ~\r\n  +----------+---------+------+----------+------+\r\n  | 149      |  16     |  29  |    3     |  3   |\r\n  | 150      |  13     |  17  |    2     |  2   |\r\n  | 151      |  37     |  63  |    7     |  2   |\r\n  |          +---------+------+----------+------+\r\n  |   Total. |  66     | 109  |   12     |  8   |\r\n  +----------+---------+------+----------+------+\r\n\r\n  +--------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n  |                         F_2 males.                                 |\r\n  +----------------+---------------+-----------------+-----------------+\r\n  |   f_a          |   f_a v s     |     f_a  s      |      f_a v      |\r\n  |   ------       |   --+----     |     ----+-      |      --+--+--   |\r\n  |      v s       |               |        v        |            s    |\r\n  +------+---------+---------+-----+------+----------+----------+------+\r\n  |Facet.|Vermilion|Facet    |Wild-|Facet |Vermilion.|Facet     |Sable.|\r\n  ~      |sable.   |vermilion|type.|sable.|          |vermilion.|      |\r\n  ~      |         |sable.   |     |      |          |          |      |\r\n  +------+---------+---------+-----+------+----------+----------+------+\r\n  | 17   | 10      |  8      | 12  |  2   |  ..      |  2       |  1   |\r\n  | ..   | 10      |  9      | ..  |  1   |  ..      | ..       | ..   |\r\n  | 38   | 23      | 12      | 26  |  2   |   8      |  4       |  1   |\r\n  +------+---------+---------+-----+------+----------+----------+------+\r\n  | 55   | 43      | 29      | 38  |  5   |   8      |  6       |  2   |\r\n  +------+---------+---------+-----+------+----------+----------+------+\r\n\r\nLINKAGE OF EOSIN, FACET, AND VERMILION.\r\n\r\nIn order to obtain more accurate information on the location of facet, a\r\nfacet male was mated to an eosin vermilion female.

Females\r\nheterozygous for this lethal, lethal _sc_, were mated to white males and\r\nthe daughters were back-crossed to white males. Half of the daughters gave\r\nlethal sex-ratio, and these gave 1,405 cross-overs in a total of 3,053\r\nmales, from which the amount of crossing-over between white and lethal _sc_\r\nhas been calculated as 46 per cent.\r\n\r\nBy reference to table 65 it is seen that white and bar normally give only\r\nabout 44 per cent of crossing-over in a two-locus experiment; lethal _sc_\r\nthen is expected to be situated at least as far to the right as bar.\r\nFemales heterozygous for lethal _sc_ were therefore crossed to bar males,\r\nand their daughters were tested. The lethal-bearing daughters gave 144\r\ncross-overs in a total of 1,734 males, that is, bar and lethal _sc_ gave\r\n8.3 per cent of crossing-over. Lethal _sc_ therefore lies 8.3 units beyond\r\nbar or at about 66.5. The cross-over value sable lethal _sc_ was found to\r\nbe 23.5 (387 cross-overs in a total of 1,641 males) which places the lethal\r\nat 43+23.5, or at 66.5. We know from other data that there is enough double\r\ncrossing-over in the distance which gives an experimental value of 23.5 per\r\ncent, so that the true distance is a half unit longer or the locus at 67.0\r\nis indicated by the 1,641 males of the sable lethal experiment. In a\r\ndistance so short that the experimental value is only 8.3 per cent there\r\nis, as far as we have been able to determine, no double crossing-over at\r\nall, or at most an amount that is entirely negligible, so that a locus at\r\n57+8.3 or 65.3 is indicated by the 1,734 males of the bar lethal\r\nexperiment. To get the value indicated by the total data the cases may be\r\nweighted, that is, the value 65.3 may be multiplied by 1,734, and 67.0 may\r\nbe multiplied by 1,641. The sum of these two numbers divided by the sum of\r\n1,734 and 1,641 gives 66.2 as the locus indicated by all the data\r\navailable. This method has been used in every case where more than one\r\nexperiment furnishes data upon the location of a factor. In constructing\r\nthe map given in diagram I rather complex balancings were necessary.\r\n\r\nLETHAL SD.\r\n\r\nThe fourth lethal which Miss Stark found (May 1914) in the inbred stocks of\r\n_Drosophila_ has not been located by means of linkage experiments. It is\r\ninteresting in that the males which receive the lethal factor sometimes\r\nlive long enough to hatch. These males are extremely feeble and never live\r\nmore than two days. There is, as far as can be seen, no anatomical defect\r\nto which their extreme feebleness and early death can be attributed. {79}\r\n\r\nFURROWED.\r\n\r\nIn studying the effect of hybridization upon the production of mutations in\r\n_Drosophila_, F. N. Duncan found a sex-linked mutation which he called\r\n\"furrowed eye\" (Duncan 1915). The furrowed flies are characterized by a\r\nforeshortening of the head, which causes the surface of the eye to be\r\nthrown into irregular folds with furrows between. The spines of the\r\nscutellum are stumpy, a character which is of importance in classification,\r\nsince quite often flies occur which have no noticeable disturbance of the\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nThe locus of furrowed was determined to be at 38.0 on the basis of the data\r\ngiven in table 61.\r\n\r\nTABLE 61.--_Data on the linkage of furrowed, from Duncan, 1915_.\r\n\r\n  +------------+-------------------------------------------+------+\r\n  |   Gens.    |               F_2 males.                  |      |\r\n  +------------+---------+---------+-----------+-----------+      +\r\n  |            | w^e m   | w^e f_w | w^e m f_w | w^e       |Total.|\r\n  |            | ------- | --+---- | -----+--- | --+--+--  |      |\r\n  |            |     f_w |     m   |           |     m f_w |      |\r\n  |            +---------+---------+-----------+-----------+------+\r\n  |Eosin,      |         |         |           |           |      |\r\n  |  miniature,|         |         |           |           |      |\r\n  |  furrowed  |   142   |    59   |     4     |    3      | 208  |\r\n  |            +=========+=========+===========+===========+======+\r\n  |            | f_w     | f_w s f | f_w  f    | f_w s     |      |\r\n  |            | ------- | --+---- | ----+-    | --+--+--  |      |\r\n  |            |    s  f |         |   s       |        f  |      |\r\n  |            |---------+---------+-----------+-----------+------+\r\n  |Furrowed,   |         |         |           |           |      ~\r\n  |  sable,    |         |         |           |           |      ~\r\n  |  forked    |   166   |     9   |    31     |    3      | 209  |\r\n  |            +=========+=========+===========+===========+======+\r\n  |            | v    B' | v f_w   | v         | v f_w B'  |      |\r\n  |            | ------- | -+----- | ----+--   | -+---+--  |      |\r\n  |            |  f_w    |      B' |  f_w B'   |           |      |\r\n  |            +---------+---------+-----------+-----------+------+\r\n  |Vermilion,  |         |         |           |           |      |\r\n  |  furrowed, |         |         |           |           |      |\r\n  |  bar       |   188   |     9   |    43     |    0      | 240  |\r\n  +------------+---------+---------+-----------+-----------+------+\r\n\r\n  +------------------------------+\r\n  |      Cross-over values.      |\r\n  +----------+---------+---------+\r\n  |Eosin     |Miniature|Eosin    |\r\n  |miniature.|furrowed.|furrowed.|\r\n  |          |         |         |\r\n  +----------+---------+---------+\r\n  |          |         |         |\r\n  |          |         |         |\r\n  | 29.8     |  30.4   |  30.3   |\r\n  +==========+=========+=========+\r\n  |Furrowed  |Sable    |Furrowed |\r\n  |sable.    |forked.  |forked.  |\r\n  |          |         |         |\r\n  +----------+---------+---------+\r\n  ~          |         |         |\r\n  ~          |         |         |\r\n  |  5.7     |  16.3   |  19.1   |\r\n  +==========+=========+=========+\r\n  |Vermilion |Furrowed |Vermilion|\r\n  |furrowed. |bar.     |bar.     |\r\n  |          |         |         |\r\n  +----------+---------+---------+\r\n  |          |         |         |\r\n  |          |         |         |\r\n  |  3.8     |  21.6   |  17.9   |\r\n  +----------+---------+---------+\r\n\r\nADDITIONAL DATA FOR YELLOW, WHITE, VERMILION, AND MINIATURE.\r\n\r\nConsiderable new work has been done by various students upon the linkage of\r\nthe older mutant characters, namely, yellow, white, vermilion, and\r\nminiature.

Henry Holt & Co., 1915.\r\n\r\n[2] _B. C._ here and throughout stands for back-cross.\r\n\r\n[3] The first dark body-color mutation \"black\" (see plate II, figs. 7, 8)\r\nhad appeared much earlier (Morgan 1911_b_, 1912_c_). It is an autosomal\r\ncharacter, a member of the second group of linked gens. Still another dark\r\nmutant, \"ebony,\" had also appeared, which was found to be a member of the\r\nthird group of gens.\r\n\r\n[4] Wherever reference numbers are given, these denote the pages in the\r\nnote-books of Bridges upon which the original entries for each culture are\r\nto be found.\r\n\r\n[5] In addition to these expected F_1 wild-type females there occurred 13\r\nfemales of an eye-color like that of the mutant pink. So far as was seen\r\nnone of the F_1 males differed in eye-color from the expected eosin\r\nvermilion. Since the eosin vermilion and sable stocks were unrelated and\r\nneither was known to contain a \"pink\" as an impurity, these \"pinks\" must be\r\ndue to mutation of an unusual kind. That these \"pinks\" were really products\r\nof the cross is proven by the result of crossing one of them to one of her\r\neosin vermilion brothers, for she showed herself to be heterozygous for\r\neosin, vermilion, and sable.\r\n\r\n_F_1 \"pink\" (Ref. 51 C) [female] x F_1 eosin vermilion [male]._\r\n\r\n  +------+---------------+----------------+---------------+---------------+\r\n  |      |   Wild-type.  |Eosin vermilion.|     Eosin.    |   Vermilion.  |\r\n  |Refer-+-------+-------+--------+-------+--------+------+--------+------+\r\n  |ence. |[female]|[male]|[female]|[male] |[female]|[male]|[female]|[male]|\r\n  +------+-------+------+---------+-------+--------+------+--------+------+\r\n  |59 C  |   59  |  38  |    43   |   40  |   15   |   9  |   16   |  17  |\r\n  +------+-------+------+---------+-------+--------+------+--------+------+\r\n\r\nIn addition to the combinations of eosin and vermilion, sable also appeared\r\nin its proper distribution though no counts were made. The four smaller\r\nclasses are cross-overs between eosin and vermilion. Since no \"pinks\"\r\nappeared the color is recessive, and the brother was not heterozygous for\r\nit.\r\n\r\nTwo other \"pink\" females mated to wild males gave similar results in their\r\nsons.\r\n\r\n_F_1 \"pink\" [female] x wild [male]._\r\n\r\n  +------------+---------+---------+---------+-------+---------+\r\n  |            |         |         |  Eosin  |       |         |\r\n  |            |Wild-type|Wild-type|Vermilion| Eosin |Vermilion|\r\n  | Reference. |[female].| [male]. | [male]. |[male].| [male]. |\r\n  +------------+---------+---------+---------+-------+---------+\r\n  | 61 C       |   101   |    33   |    37   |    9  |    11   |\r\n  +------------+---------+---------+---------+-------+---------+\r\n\r\nThese F_1 flies should all be heterozygous for \"pink.\" A pair of wild-type\r\nflies which were mated gave a 3 : 1 ratio--wild type 51 to \"pink\" 18. From\r\nthe \"pinks\" which appeared in this cross a stock was made which was lost\r\nthrough sterility. Females tested to males of true pink were also sterile,\r\nso that no solution can be given of the case.\r\n\r\n[6] Purple is an eye-color whose gen is in the second chromosome.\r\n\r\n[7] The curve published by Miss Stark included by mistake 6 cultures from\r\nthe succeeding generations, and these coming from only one of the lethals\r\n(lethal _sb_) increase its mode so that the mode of the other lethal\r\n(lethal _sa_) becomes submerged. If these cultures are taken out the curve\r\nshows two modes more clearly.\r\n\r\n[8] The figures to the left in each double column correspond to the symbols\r\nabove the heavy line, as, in the first example 6,219 white miniature. The\r\nsimilar figure to the right corresponds to the symbol below the heavy line.\r\nIf no symbols are present below, as in the first example, the column to the\r\nright should be read wild-type.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nChanges made against printed original.\r\n\r\nPage 24. \"two contrary classes, eosin vermilion and bar\": 'eosin bar and\r\nvermilion' in original.\r\n\r\nPage 59. \"The bristles which are most distorted\": 'disorted' in original.\r\n\r\nPages 69-70.
