The dynamo, the electric\r\nmotor, the telegraph, with and without wires, the telephone, air-ships,\r\nand many other inventions excite in him an interest which is deeper than\r\nmere curiosity. He wants to know how these things work, and how they\r\nwere invented. The man is so absorbed in the present that he cares\r\nlittle for the past. Not so with the boy. He cares for the history of\r\ninventions, and in this he is wiser than the man, for it is only by a\r\nstudy of its origin and growth that we can understand the larger\r\nsignificance of a great invention.\r\n\r\nGreat inventions have their origin in great discoveries. The story of\r\ngreat inventions, therefore, includes the story of the discoveries out\r\nof which they have arisen. The stories of the discoveries and the\r\ninventions are inseparable from the lives of the men who made them, and\r\nso we must deal with biography, which in itself is of interest to the\r\nboy. Such a story is the story of physical science in the service of\r\nhumanity.\r\n\r\nThe interest of the youth in great inventions is unquestioned. Shall we\r\nstifle this interest by overemphasis of technical detail, or shall we\r\nminister to it as a thing vital in the life of the youth of to-day?\r\n\r\nA few sentences quoted from G. Stanley Hall will indicate the author's\r\npoint of view. \"The youth is in the humanist stage. Nature is sentiment\r\nbefore it becomes idea or formula or utility.\" \"The heroes and history\r\nepochs of each branch [of science] add another needed quality to the\r\nstill so largely humanistic stage.\" \"A new discovery, besides its\r\ntechnical record, involves the added duty of concise and lucid popular\r\nstatement as a tribute to youth.\" The need of a \"concise and lucid\r\npopular statement\" of the rise of the great inventions which form the\r\nmaterial basis of our modern civilization and all of which are new to\r\nthe young mind, has no doubt been keenly felt by others as it has been\r\nby the author. The story of our great inventions has been told in sundry\r\nvolumes for adult readers, but nowhere has this story, alive with human\r\ninterest, been told in a form suited to the young. It was the\r\nrealization of this need growing out of years of experience in teaching\r\nthese branches that led the author to attempt the task of writing the\r\nstory.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this book is to tell in simple language how our great\r\ninventions came into being, to depict the life-struggles of the men who\r\nmade them, and, in the telling of the story, to explain the working of\r\nthe inventions in a way the boy can understand. The stories which are\r\nhere woven together present the great epochs in the history of physics,\r\nand are intended to give to the young reader a connected view of the way\r\nin which our great inventions have arisen out of scientific discovery on\r\nthe one hand, and conditions which we may call social and economic on\r\nthe other hand. If the book shall appeal to young readers, and lead them\r\nto an appreciation of the meaning of a great invention, the author will\r\nfeel that his purpose has been achieved.\r\n\r\nThe author is deeply indebted to Dr. Charles A. McMurry and Prof. Newell\r\nD. Gilbert, of the Northern Illinois State Normal School; Profs. C. R.\r\nMann and R. A.

B.\r\n\r\n    CHICAGO, _June, 1910_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STORY OF GREAT INVENTIONS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter I\r\n\r\nTHE AGE OF ARCHIMEDES\r\n\r\n    Archimedes, the First Great Inventor\r\n\r\n\r\nArchimedes, the first great inventor, lived in Syracuse more than two\r\nthousand years ago. Syracuse was a Greek city on the island of Sicily.\r\nThe King of Syracuse, Hiero, took great interest in the discoveries of\r\nArchimedes.\r\n\r\nOne day Archimedes said to King Hiero that with his own strength he\r\ncould move any weight whatever. He even said that, if there were another\r\nearth to which he could go, he could move this earth wherever he\r\npleased. The King, full of wonder, begged of him to prove the truth of\r\nhis statement by moving some very heavy weight. Whereupon Archimedes\r\ncaused one of the King's galleys to be drawn ashore. This required many\r\nhands and much labor. Having manned the ship and put on board her usual\r\nloading, he placed himself at a distance and easily moved with his hand\r\nthe end of a machine which consisted of a variety of ropes and pulleys,\r\ndrawing the ship over the sand in as smooth and gentle a manner as if\r\nshe had been under sail. The King, quite astonished, prevailed with\r\nArchimedes to make for him all manner of machines which could be used\r\neither for attack or defence in a siege.\r\n\r\n    The Battle of Syracuse\r\n\r\nDuring the life of King Hiero Syracuse had no occasion to use the war\r\nmachines of Archimedes. The grandson of King Hiero, who succeeded to the\r\nthrone, was a tyrant. He attempted to throw off the sovereignty of Rome\r\nand entered into an alliance with Carthage. His cruelty toward his own\r\npeople was so great that, after a short reign, he was assassinated.\r\nThere was anarchy in Syracuse for a time, the Roman and anti-Roman\r\nparties striving for supremacy. The anti-Roman party gaining possession\r\nof the city, the Romans, in order to bring Syracuse again into\r\nsubjection, prepared for an attack by sea and land. Then it was that\r\nSyracuse had need of the war machines made by Archimedes (Fig. 1).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1--THE BATTLE OF SYRACUSE\r\n  The city defended by the inventions of Archimedes.]\r\n\r\nThe Romans came with a large land force and a fleet. They were sure that\r\nwithin five days they could conquer the city. But there are times when\r\none man with brains is worth more than an army. In the battle which\r\nfollowed, Archimedes with his inventions was more than a match for the\r\nRomans.\r\n\r\nThe city was strong from the fact that the wall on one side lay along a\r\nchain of hills with overhanging brows; on the other side the wall had\r\nits foundation close down by the sea.\r\n\r\nA fleet of sixty ships commanded by Marcellus bore down upon the city.\r\nThe ships were full of men armed with bows and slings and javelins with\r\nwhich to dislodge the men who fought on the battlements. Eight ships had\r\nbeen fastened together in pairs. These double vessels were rowed by the\r\nouter oars of each of the pair. On each pair of ships was a ladder four\r\nfeet wide and of a height to reach to the top of the wall. Each side of\r\nthe ladder was protected by a railing, and a small roof-like covering,\r\ncalled a penthouse, was fastened to the upper end of the ladder. This\r\ncovering served to protect the soldiers until they could reach the top\r\nof the wall. They thought to bring these double ships close to shore,\r\nraise the ladders by ropes and pulleys until they rested against the\r\nwall, then scale the wall and capture the city.\r\n\r\nBut Archimedes had crossbows ready, and, when the ships were still at\r\nsome distance, he shot stones and darts at the enemy, wounding and\r\ngreatly annoying them. When these began to carry over their heads, he\r\nused smaller crossbows of shorter range, so that stones and darts fell\r\nconstantly in their midst. By this means he checked their advance, and\r\nfinally Marcellus, in despair, was obliged to bring up his ships under\r\ncover of night. But when they had come close to land, and so too near to\r\nbe hit by the crossbows, they found that Archimedes had another\r\ncontrivance ready. He had pierced the wall as high as a man's head with\r\nmany loopholes which on the outside were about as big as the palm of the\r\nhand. Inside the wall he had stationed archers and men with crossbows to\r\nshoot down the marines. By these means he not only baffled the enemy,\r\nbut killed the greater number of them. When they tried to use their\r\nladders, they discovered that he had cranes ready all along the walls,\r\nnot visible at other times but which suddenly reared themselves above\r\nthe wall from the inside and stretched their beams far over the\r\nbattlements, some of them carrying stones weighing about five hundred\r\npounds, and others great masses of lead. So, whenever the ships came\r\nnear, these beams swung round on their pivots and by means of a rope\r\nrunning through a pulley dropped the stones upon the ships. The result\r\nwas that they not only smashed the ships to pieces, but killed many of\r\nthe soldiers on board.\r\n\r\nAnother machine made by Archimedes was an \"iron hand\" or grappling-hook\r\nswung on a chain and carried by a crane. The hook was dropped on the\r\nprow of a ship, and when it had taken hold the ship was lifted until it\r\nstood on its stern, then quickly dropped, causing it either to sink or\r\nship a great quantity of water.\r\n\r\nWith such machines, unknown before, Archimedes drove back the enemy. On\r\nthe landward side similar machines were used. The Romans were reduced to\r\nsuch a state of terror that \"if they saw but a rope or a stick put over\r\nthe walls they cried out that Archimedes was levelling some machine at\r\nthem and turned their backs and fled.\"\r\n\r\nAfter a long siege, however, hunger forced the Syracusans to surrender.\r\nMarcellus so admired the genius of Archimedes that he gave orders that\r\nhe should not be injured. Yet, in the sack of the city which followed,\r\nArchimedes was slain by a Roman soldier.\r\n\r\nThe Roman historian Livy records that \"Archimedes, while intent on some\r\nfigures which he had made in the dust, although the confusion was as\r\ngreat as could possibly be, was put to death by a soldier who did not\r\nknow who he was; that Marcellus was greatly grieved at this, and that\r\npains were taken about his funeral, while his relations also were\r\ncarefully sought and received honor and protection on account of his\r\nname and memory.\"\r\n\r\n    Archimedes' Principle\r\n\r\nHiero, when he became King of Syracuse, decreed that a crown of gold, of\r\ngreat value, should be placed in a certain temple as an offering to the\r\ngods, and sent to a manufacturer the correct weight of gold. In due time\r\nthe crown was brought to the King, and a beautiful piece of work it was.\r\nThe weight of the crown was the same as that of the gold, but a report\r\nwas circulated that some of the gold had been taken out and silver\r\nsupplied in its place. Hiero was angry, but knew no method by which the\r\ntheft might be detected. He therefore requested Archimedes to give the\r\nmatter his attention.\r\n\r\nWhile trying to solve this problem Archimedes went one day to a bath. As\r\nhe got into the bath-tub he saw that as his body became immersed the\r\nwater ran out of the tub. He quickly saw how he could solve the problem,\r\nleaped out of the bath in joy, and, running home naked, cried out with a\r\nloud voice \"Eureka! eureka!\" (I have found it! I have found it!)\r\n\r\nUsing a piece of gold and a piece of silver, each equal in weight to the\r\ncrown, and a large vase full of water, he proved that the crown was not\r\npure gold, and found how much silver had been mixed with the gold.\r\n\r\nThe incident of the golden crown may have been the starting-point of\r\nArchimedes' study of solid bodies when immersed in fluids. Every one\r\nknows that a boy can lift a heavy stone under water that he could not\r\nlift out of water. The stone seems lighter when in the water. A diver\r\nwith his lead-soled shoes could scarcely walk on land, but walks easily\r\nunder water. When the diver comes up, the place where he was immediately\r\nbecomes filled with water. Now, whatever that water weighs which fills\r\nthe diver's place, just that much weight will the diver lose when he\r\ngoes down. What is true of the diver is true of the stone or of any\r\nobject under water. The stone when in the water loses just as much\r\nweight as the weight of the water that would fill its place. This is the\r\nfact which was discovered by Archimedes and which is called \"Archimedes'\r\nPrinciple.\"\r\n\r\nIt is said by an ancient author that Archimedes invented more than forty\r\nmachines. Of these the best known are the block and tackle, the endless\r\nscrew (worm gear), and the water snail, or Archimedean screw. Yet his\r\ndelight was not in his machines, but in his mathematics. Though he had\r\ninvented machines to please his king, he regarded such work as trifling,\r\nand took little interest in the common needs of life.\r\n\r\n    Inventions of the Ancient Greeks\r\n\r\nThe common needs of life are to-day the chief concern of the greatest\r\nmen, and so we find it hard to sympathize with this view of Archimedes.\r\nHis view, however, was that of other learned men of his time, that the\r\ncommon needs of life are beneath the dignity of the scholar, and so we\r\ncan see why the Greeks made so few great inventions.\r\n\r\nHero, who lived a century later than Archimedes, invented a\r\nsteam-engine, which, however, was only a toy. A water-clock, in which\r\nthe first cog-wheels were used, was invented by another Greek named\r\nKtesibus, who also invented the force-pump. The suction-pump was known\r\nin the time of Aristotle, who lived about a century before the time of\r\nArchimedes, but the inventor is unknown.\r\n\r\nConcerning electricity, the Greeks knew very little. They knew that\r\namber when rubbed will attract light objects, such as dust or chaff.\r\nAmber was called by the Greeks \"electron,\" because it reflected the\r\nbrightness of the sunlight, and their name for the sun was \"Elector.\"\r\nFrom the Greek name for amber we get our word \"electricity.\"\r\n\r\nThe Greeks possessed scarcely more knowledge of magnets than of\r\nelectricity. In fact, their ideas of magnets cannot be called knowledge,\r\nfor they consisted chiefly of legends.\r\n\r\nThey told of the shepherd Magnes, who, while watching his flock on Mount\r\nIda, suddenly found the iron ferrule of his staff and the nails of his\r\nshoes adhering to a stone; that, later, this stone was called, after\r\nhim, the \"Magnes stone,\" or \"Magnet.\"\r\n\r\nThey told impossible stories of iron statues being suspended in the air\r\nby means of magnets, and of ships sailing near the magnetic mountains\r\nwhen every nail and piece of iron in the ship would fly to the mountain,\r\nleaving the ship a wreck upon the waves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter II\r\n\r\nTHE AGE OF GALILEO\r\n\r\n    Galileo and the Battle for Truth\r\n\r\n\r\nFor eighteen centuries after the time of Archimedes no inventions of\r\nimportance were made. Men sought for truth where truth could not be\r\nfound. They looked within their mouldy manuscripts and asked, \"What do\r\nthe great philosophers say ought to happen?\" instead of looking at\r\nnature and asking, \"What does happen?\" And when a man arose who dared to\r\ndoubt the authority of the old masters and turn to nature to find out\r\nthe truth, all the weapons at the command of the old school were hurled\r\nagainst him.\r\n\r\nLet us, at this distance, blame neither the one side nor the other. The\r\nconflict was inevitable. It was an accident of history that the brunt of\r\nthe attack fell upon a man born in Italy in 1564, and that the battle\r\nwas fought chiefly in the \"Eternal City,\" from which centuries before\r\nhad marched the legions that conquered the world.\r\n\r\nThe boy, Galileo, who was to become the central figure of the great\r\nconflict, was talented in many ways. In lute-playing his skill excelled\r\nthat of his father, who was one of the noted musicians of his day. His\r\nskill in drawing was such that noted artists submitted their work to\r\nhim for criticism. He wrote essays on the works of Dante and other\r\nclassical writers. He amused his boy companions by constructing toy\r\nmachines which, though ingenious, did not always work.\r\n\r\nHis preference was for mechanics, but, as this subject offered little\r\nprospect of profitable work, he took up the study of medicine in\r\naccordance with his father's wishes.\r\n\r\nIn his eighteenth year he entered the University of Pisa. Here he found\r\nmen who refused to think for themselves, but decided every question by\r\nreferring to what the ancient philosophers said. Galileo could not\r\nendure such slavish submission to authority. So strongly did he assert\r\nhimself that he was nicknamed \"The Wrangler,\" and, by his wrangling, he\r\nlost a scholarship in the university.\r\n\r\nHe neglected his medical studies and secretly studied mathematics. His\r\nfather, learning of this, consented to his becoming a mathematician.\r\nThus he followed his bent, though it seemed to lead directly to poverty.\r\n\r\n    The Pendulum Clock\r\n\r\nIt was while a student at the University of Pisa that he discovered a\r\nlaw of pendulums which makes possible our pendulum clocks. While at his\r\ndevotions in the cathedral, he observed the swinging of the bronze lamp\r\nwhich had been drawn back for lighting. Timing its swinging by means of\r\nhis pulse, the only timepiece in his possession, he found that the time\r\nof one swing remained the same, though the length of the swing grew\r\nsmaller and smaller. This discovery led to his invention of an\r\ninstrument for physicians' use in timing the pulse. About fifty years\r\nlater he invented the pendulum clock (Fig. 2).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2--GALILEO'S PENDULUM CLOCK\r\n  It had only one hand, which is not shown in the picture.]\r\n\r\nLack of funds compelled him to leave the university without completing\r\nhis course. He returned to the parental roof and continued his\r\nscientific studies. The writings of Archimedes were his favorite study.\r\nWith Archimedes' famous experiment on King Hiero's crown as a\r\nstarting-point, he discovered the laws of floating bodies, which explain\r\nwhy a ship or other object floats on water, and invented a balance for\r\nweighing objects in water.\r\n\r\nBut such employment won nothing more substantial than honor and fame.\r\nFood and clothing were needed. For two years he strove without success\r\nto secure employment. At the end of that time he was appointed professor\r\nof mathematics in the University of Pisa at the magnificent salary of\r\nsixty scudi (about sixty-three dollars) per year. \"But any port in a\r\nstorm; and in Galileo's needy circumstances even this wretched salary\r\nwas not to be rejected.\" Moreover, he could add somewhat to his income\r\nby private tutoring.\r\n\r\n    Galileo's Experiment with Falling Shot\r\n\r\nWhile teaching at the University of Pisa, he performed his famous\r\nexperiment of dropping from the top of the leaning tower two shot, one\r\nweighing ten pounds, the other one pound. Now, according to Aristotle,\r\nthe ten-pound shot should fall in one-tenth the time required by the\r\none-pound shot. But the assembled company of professors and students saw\r\nthe two shot start together, fall together, and strike the ground at\r\nthe same instant, and still refused to believe their own eyes. They\r\ncontinued to affirm that a weight of ten pounds would reach the ground\r\nin a tenth of the time taken by a one-pound weight, because they were\r\nable to quote chapter and verse in which Aristotle assured them that\r\nsuch is the fact. Thus Galileo made enemies of the other professors, but\r\nfor a time they could do nothing more than annoy him.\r\n\r\nAbout this time Galileo incurred the wrath of the Grand Duke of Tuscany,\r\nfrom whom he had received his appointment. He was commissioned to\r\nexamine a machine invented by a nephew of the Grand Duke for the purpose\r\nof cleaning harbors. Galileo plainly said that the machine was\r\nworthless. It was tried, and his opinion proved true. But like the kings\r\nof olden time who killed the bearer of evil tidings even though the\r\ntidings were true, his enemies made his position so unpleasant that he\r\nresigned.\r\n\r\nHe had neither employment nor money. His father's death occurring about\r\nthis time, threw upon him the care of a mother, a worthless brother, and\r\ntwo sisters. In his distress he sought help from a friend, and secured\r\nan appointment as professor of mathematics in the University of Padua.\r\nHis salary was one hundred and eighty florins (about ninety-five\r\ndollars), while other professors received more than ten times as much.\r\n\r\nWhile at Padua, Galileo was busy inventing. He invented the sector,\r\nwhich is to be found in most cases of mathematical instruments and is\r\nused in certain kinds of drawing. He also invented an air thermometer\r\n(Fig. 3), the first instrument for measuring temperature.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3--AN AIR THERMOMETER\r\n  When the air in the bulb grows cooler it contracts, and the air\r\noutside forces the Water up the tube. When the air in the bulb grows\r\nwarmer it expands and forces the water down in the tube.]\r\n\r\nIn 1604 there appeared a new star of great brilliancy. It continued to\r\nshine with varying brightness for eighteen months, and then vanished.\r\nThis was a strange event, and Galileo made use of it. He proved that the\r\nnew star must lie among the most distant of the heavenly bodies, and\r\nthis fact did not agree with Aristotle's view that the heavens are\r\nperfect, and therefore never change. A heated controversy followed, and\r\nGalileo came out boldly in favor of the theory that the earth revolves\r\nabout the sun, the prevailing notion then being that the earth does not\r\nmove, but that the sun and other heavenly bodies revolve around it.\r\n\r\n    The Telescope\r\n\r\nIn 1609 Galileo learned of a discovery that was to be of great value to\r\nthe world, but a source of untold trouble to himself. An apprentice of a\r\nDutch optician, while playing with spectacle lenses, chanced to observe\r\nthat if two of the lenses were placed in a certain position objects seen\r\nthrough them appeared much nearer. Galileo, learning of this, set to\r\nwork to construct a spy-glass, applying his knowledge of light. In one\r\nday he had constructed such an instrument, in which he used two lenses\r\nlike the lenses of the modern opera-glass. Thus, while the Dutchman's\r\ndiscovery was by accident, Galileo's was by reasoning, and was the more\r\nfruitful, as we shall see.\r\n\r\nGalileo continued improving his telescope until he had made one which\r\nwould magnify thirty times. He was the first to apply the telescope to\r\nthe study of the heavenly bodies. The most startling of his discoveries\r\nwas that of the moons of the planet Jupiter, which he called new\r\nplanets.\r\n\r\nThis aroused the fury of his enemies, who ridiculed the idea of there\r\nbeing new planets; \"for,\" they said, \"to see these planets they must\r\nfirst be put inside the telescope.\" The excitement was intense. Poets\r\nchanted the praise of Galileo. A public fête was held in his honor. One\r\nof his pupils was imprisoned in the tower of San Marco, where he had\r\ngone to make observations with his telescope, and could not escape until\r\nthe crowd had satisfied their curiosity. Some of the philosophers\r\nrefused to look lest they should see and be convinced.\r\n\r\n    Galileo's Struggle\r\n\r\nHis enemies sought to steal from him the honor of his discoveries. Some\r\nclaimed to have made the discoveries before Galileo did. Others claimed\r\nthat his discoveries were false, that their only use was to gratify\r\nGalileo's vanity and thirst for gold. In these trying times the\r\nfriendship of the great astronomer Kepler warded off some of the most\r\nexasperating attacks.\r\n\r\nGalileo's fame spread throughout Europe. Students came in great numbers,\r\nso that he had little leisure left for his own studies. He therefore\r\ndecided to leave Padua, and secured an appointment as mathematician and\r\nphilosopher to the Grand Duke of Tuscany. This appointment took him to\r\nFlorence. It was here that an incident occurred that marked the\r\nbeginning of a persecution which continued to the end of his life.\r\n\r\nAs we read the story of this conflict let us remember that it was not\r\nprimarily a conflict between the Roman Catholic Church and Galileo. It\r\nwas a conflict of principles. On the one side were arrayed those who\r\nsaid that men should always believe as the ancient writers did; on the\r\nother, those who said men should think for themselves. In the first\r\nparty were most of the university professors and others who dreaded the\r\nintroduction of new beliefs, whether in religion or science. In the\r\nsecond party were Galileo and a small band of devoted followers.\r\n\r\nAt a dinner at the table of the Grand Duke in Pisa the conversation\r\nturned on the moons of Jupiter. Some praised Galileo. Others condemned\r\nhim, saying that the Holy Scriptures were opposed to his theory of the\r\nmotion of the earth. A friend reported the incident to Galileo, and he\r\nreplied to the arguments of his opponents in a letter which was made\r\npublic. No doubt the sting of his sarcasm made his enemies more bitter.\r\nHe admitted that the Scriptures cannot lie or err, but this, he said,\r\ndoes not hold good of those who attempt to explain the Scriptures. In\r\nanother letter, he quoted with approval a saying of Cardinal Baronius,\r\n\"The Holy Spirit intended to teach us in the Bible how to go to Heaven,\r\nnot how the heavens go.\"\r\n\r\nThe first shot had been fired. The battle was on, and the Church,\r\nbecause it possessed the most powerful weapons of attack, was used by\r\nthe combined forces to break the power of Galileo's reasoning. He went\r\nto Rome to make his defence, but was commanded by the Holy Office not to\r\nhold or teach that the sun is immovable, and that the earth moves about\r\nthe sun.\r\n\r\nDuring another visit to Rome there was shown to Galileo an instrument\r\nwhich, it was said, would show a flea as large as a cricket. Galileo\r\nrecalled that some years before he had so arranged a telescope that he\r\nhad seen flies which he said looked as big as a lamb, and were covered\r\nall over with hair. This was the first microscope. Galileo quickly\r\nimproved the instrument, and soon his microscopes were in great demand.\r\n\r\nIn violation of the decree of the Church, to which he had submitted, he\r\npublished his most famous work in which he defended the theory that the\r\nearth moves about the sun. The book was the outcome of his life-work,\r\nbut the Church believed it dangerous. He was summoned to Rome. Confined\r\nto a sick-bed, he pleaded for delay, which was granted. Before he\r\nrecovered, however, the summons was made imperative. He must go to Rome,\r\nor be carried in irons. He went in a litter, carried by servants of the\r\nGrand Duke. In Rome he was to appear before the Inquisition. There he\r\nwas treated with a consideration never before accorded to a prisoner of\r\nthe Inquisition. Nor was he subjected to torture, as has been stated by\r\nsome. He was found guilty of teaching the doctrine that the sun does not\r\nmove, and that the earth moves about the sun. He was compelled to\r\nrecant, and sentenced to the prison of the Holy Office and, by way of\r\npenance, to repeat once a week for three years the seven penitential\r\nPsalms.\r\n\r\nHe yielded without reserve to the decree of the Inquisition, renounced\r\nhis \"errors and heresies,\" and, with his hand on the Bible, took oath\r\nnever again to teach the forbidden doctrine.\r\n\r\nAnd now, though a shattered old man of seventy-four, enjoined to\r\nsilence on the chief results of his life-work, nothing could quench his\r\ndevotion to science. In these last years, he published a new book which,\r\nwith his earlier work, entitles him to be regarded as the founder of the\r\nscience of mechanics.\r\n\r\nIn his study of machines Galileo found that no machine will do work of\r\nitself. Whenever a machine is at work, a man or a horse, or some other\r\npower, is at work upon the machine. In no case will a machine do work\r\nwithout receiving an equal amount of work.\r\n\r\n    Torricelli and the Barometer\r\n\r\nGalileo had a pump which he found would not work when the water was\r\nthirty-five feet below the valve. He thought the pump was injured, and\r\nsent for the maker. The maker assured him that no pump would do better.\r\nThis led Torricelli, one of Galileo's pupils, to the discovery of the\r\nbarometer. Men had said that water rises in a pump because nature abhors\r\na vacuum. Torricelli believed that air-pressure and not nature's \"horror\r\nof a vacuum\" is the cause of water rising in a pump. He invented the\r\nbarometer to measure air-pressure.\r\n\r\nThe first barometer was a glass tube filled with quick-silver or mercury\r\n(Fig. 4). The tube was closed at the upper end, and the lower end,\r\nwhich was open, dipped in a dish of mercury. He allowed the tube to\r\nstand, and saw that the height of the mercury changed. This he believed\r\nwas because the air-pressure changed. Wind, Torricelli said, is caused\r\nby a difference of air-pressure, which is due to unequal heating of the\r\nair. For this reason a cool breeze blows from the mountain top to the\r\nheated valley, or from sea to land on a summer day.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4--TORRICELLI'S EXPERIMENT]\r\n\r\n    Otto Von Guericke and the Air-Pump\r\n\r\nAbout this time a German burgomaster, Otto von Guericke, of Magdeburg,\r\nwas performing experiments on air-pressure. The Thirty Years' War had\r\nbeen raging for thirteen years. The Swedish King, Gustavus Adolphus, had\r\nlanded in Germany, and was winning victory after victory over the\r\nimperial troops. Magdeburg had entered into an alliance with the Swedish\r\nKing, by which he was granted free passage through the city, while, on\r\nthe other hand, he promised protection to the city.\r\n\r\nThe imperial army under Tilly and Pappenheim laid siege to the city. On\r\nthe one side there was hope that Gustavus would arrive in time to effect\r\na rescue; on the other, a determination to conquer before such aid could\r\narrive. While Gustavus was on his way to the rescue, Magdeburg was taken\r\nby storm, and the most horrible scene of the Thirty Years' War was\r\nenacted. Tilly gave up the city to plunder, and his soldiers without\r\nmercy killed men, women, and children. In the midst of the scene of\r\ncarnage the city was set on fire, and soon the horrors of fire were\r\nadded to the horrors of the sword. In less than twelve hours twenty\r\nthousand people perished.\r\n\r\nGuericke's house and family were saved, but the sufferings of the city\r\nwere not yet ended. In five years the enemy was again before the walls,\r\nand Magdeburg, then in the possession of the Swedes, was compelled to\r\nyield to the combined Saxon and imperial troops. Guericke entered the\r\nservice of Saxony, and was again made mayor of the city.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of these scenes of war, he found time to continue his\r\nstudies. He made the first air-pump, and with it performed experiments\r\nwhich led to some very important results.\r\n\r\nThe experiments which Guericke made with his air-pump aroused the\r\nattention of the princes, and especially Emperor Ferdinand. Guericke was\r\ncalled to perform his experiments before the Emperor. The most striking\r\nof these experiments he performed with two hollow copper hemispheres\r\nabout a foot in diameter, fitted closely together. When the air was\r\npumped out, sixteen horses were barely able to pull the hemispheres\r\napart, though, when air was admitted, they fell apart of their own\r\nweight.\r\n\r\nAnother experiment which astonished his audience was performed with the\r\ncylinder of a large pump (Fig. 5). A rope was tied to the piston. This\r\nrope was passed over a pulley, and a large number of men applied their\r\nstrength to the rope to hold the piston in place. When the air was taken\r\nout of the cylinder, the piston was forced down by air-pressure, and the\r\nmen were lifted violently from the ground. This experiment, as we shall\r\nsee, was of great importance in the invention of the steam-engine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5--GUERICKE'S AIR-PUMP\r\n  Men lifted from the ground by air-pressure.]\r\n\r\nGuericke's study of air-pressure led him to make a water barometer (Fig.\r\n6). This consisted of a glass tube about thirty feet long dipping into a\r\ndish of water. The tube was filled with water, and the top projected\r\nabove the roof of the house. On the water in the tube he placed a wooden\r\nimage of a man. In fair weather the image would be seen above the\r\nhousetop. On the approach of a storm the image would drop out of sight.\r\nThis led his superstitious neighbors to accuse him of being in league\r\nwith Satan.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6--GUERICKE'S WATER BAROMETER\r\n  In fair weather the image appeared above the housetop. When a storm\r\nwas approaching the image dropped below the roof into the house.]\r\n\r\nThe first electrical machine was made by Guericke. This was simply a\r\nglobe of sulphur turning on a wooden axle. He observed that when the dry\r\nhand was held against the revolving globe, the globe would attract bits\r\nof paper and other light objects.\r\n\r\n    Robert Boyle and the Pressure of Air and Steam\r\n\r\nRobert Boyle, in England, improved the air-pump and performed many new\r\nand interesting experiments with it. One of his experiments was to make\r\nwater boil by means of an air-pump without applying heat. It is now well\r\nknown that water when boiling on a high mountain is not so hot as when\r\nboiling down in the valley. This is because the air-pressure is less on\r\nthe mountain top than in the valley. By using an air-pump to remove the\r\nair-pressure, water may be made to boil when it is still quite cold to\r\nthe hand.\r\n\r\nBoyle compared the action of air under pressure to a steel spring. The\r\n\"spring\" of the air is evident to us in the pneumatic tire of the\r\nbicycle or automobile. Boyle found that the more air is compressed the\r\ngreater is its pressure or \"spring,\" and that steam as it expands\r\nexerts less and less pressure. This is important in the steam-engine.\r\n\r\n    Pascal and the Hydraulic Press\r\n\r\nIt was Blaise Pascal, a Frenchman, who proved beyond the possibility of\r\na doubt that air-pressure supports the mercury in a barometer, and lifts\r\nthe water in a pump (Fig. 7). He had two mercury barometers exactly\r\nalike set up at the foot of a mountain. The mercury stood at the same\r\nheight in each. Then one barometer was left at the foot of the mountain,\r\nand the other was carried to the summit, about three thousand feet high.\r\nThe mercury in the second barometer then stood more than three inches\r\nlower than at first. As the barometer was carried down the mountain the\r\nmercury slowly rose until, at the foot, it stood at the same height as\r\nat first. The party stopped about half-way down the mountain, allowing\r\nthe barometer to rest there for some time, and observing it carefully.\r\nThey found that the mercury stood about an inch and a half higher than\r\nat the foot of the mountain. During all this time the height of the\r\nmercury in the barometer which had been left at the foot of the mountain\r\ndid not change.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7--A LIFT-PUMP\r\n  Air pressing down on the water in the well causes the water to rise in\r\nthe pump. The air can do this only when the plunger is at work removing\r\nair or water and reducing the pressure inside the pump.]\r\n\r\nIt is now known that when a barometer is carried up to a height of nine\r\nhundred feet, the mercury stands an inch lower than at the earth's\r\nsurface. For every nine hundred feet of elevation the mercury is lowered\r\nabout one inch. In this way the height of a mountain can be measured,\r\nand a man in a balloon or an air-ship can tell at what height he is\r\nsailing. For this purpose, however, a barometer is used that is more\r\neasily carried than a mercury barometer.\r\n\r\nPascal invented the hydraulic press, a machine with which he said he\r\ncould multiply pressure to any extent, which reminds us of Archimedes'\r\nsaying that, with his own hand, he could move the earth if only he had a\r\nplace to stand. Pascal could so arrange his machine that a man pressing\r\nwith a force of a hundred pounds on the handle could produce a pressure\r\nof many tons. In fact, a man can so arrange this machine that he can\r\nlift any weight whatever (Fig. 8).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8--A SIMPLE HYDRAULIC PRESS\r\n  A one-pound weight holds up a hundred pounds.]\r\n\r\nThe hydraulic press has two cylinders. One cylinder must be larger than\r\nthe other. The two cylinders are filled with a liquid, as water or oil,\r\nand are connected by a tube so that the liquid can flow from one\r\ncylinder into the other. There is a tightly fitting piston in each\r\ncylinder. If one piston has an area of one square inch, and the other\r\nhas an area of one hundred square inches, then every pound of pressure\r\non the small piston causes a hundred pounds of pressure on the large\r\npiston. A hundred pounds on the small piston would lift a weight of ten\r\nthousand pounds on the large piston. But we can see that the large\r\npiston cannot move as fast as the small one does. Though we can lift a\r\nvery heavy weight with this machine, we must expect this heavy weight to\r\nmove slowly. There must be a loss in speed to make up for the gain in\r\nthe weight lifted (Fig. 9). An hydraulic press with belt-driven pump is\r\nillustrated in Fig. 10.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9--HOW AN HYDRAULIC PRESS WORKS\r\n  One man with the machine can exert as much pressure as a hundred men\r\ncould without the machine. The arrows show the direction in which the\r\nliquid is forced by the action of the plunger _p_. The large piston _P_\r\nis forced up, thus compressing the paper.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10--AN HYDRAULIC PRESS WITH BELT-DRIVEN PUMP]\r\n\r\n    Newton\r\n\r\nSir Isaac Newton as a boy did not show any unusual talent. In school he\r\nwas backward and inattentive for a number of years, until one day the\r\nboy above him in class gave him a kick in the stomach. This roused him\r\nand, to avenge the insult, he applied himself to study and quickly\r\npassed above his offending classmate. His strong spirit was aroused, and\r\nhe soon took up his position at the head of his class.\r\n\r\nIt was his delight to invent amusements for his classmates. He made\r\npaper kites, and carefully thought out the best shape for a kite and the\r\nnumber of points to which to attach the string. He would attach paper\r\nlanterns to these kites and fly them on dark nights, to the delight of\r\nhis companions and the dismay of the superstitious country people, who\r\nmistook them for comets portending some great calamity. He made a toy\r\nmill to be run by a mouse, which he called the miller; a mechanical\r\ncarriage, run by a handle worked by the person inside, a water-clock,\r\nthe hand of which was turned by a piece of wood which fell or rose by\r\nthe action of dropping water.\r\n\r\nAt the age of fifteen, his mother, then a widow, removed him from school\r\nto take charge of the family estate. But the farm was not to his liking.\r\nThe sheep went astray, and the cattle trod down the corn while he was\r\nperusing a book or working with some machine of his own construction.\r\nHis mother wisely permitted him to return to school. After completing\r\nthe course in the village school he entered Trinity College, Cambridge.\r\n\r\n    Gravitation\r\n\r\nIt was in the year following his graduation from Cambridge that he made\r\nhis greatest discovery--that of the law of gravitation. A plague had\r\nbroken out in Cambridge, to escape which Newton had retired to his\r\nestate at Woolsthorpe. Here he was sitting one day alone in the garden\r\nthinking of the wonderful power which causes all bodies to fall toward\r\nthe earth. The same power, he thought, which causes an apple to fall to\r\nthe ground causes bodies to fall on the tops of the highest mountains\r\nand in the deepest mines. May it not extend farther than the tops of the\r\nmountains? May it not extend even as far as the moon? And, if it does,\r\nis not this power alone able to hold the moon in its orbit, as it bends\r\ninto a curve a stone thrown from the hand?\r\n\r\nThere followed a long calculation requiring years to complete. Seeing\r\nthat the results were likely to prove his theory of gravitation, he was\r\nso overcome that he could not finish the work. When this was done by one\r\nof his friends, it was found that Newton's thought was correct--that the\r\nforce of gravitation which causes bodies to fall at the earth's surface\r\nis the same as the force which holds the moon in its orbit. As the earth\r\nand moon attract each other, so every star and planet attracts every\r\nother star and planet, and this attraction is gravitation.\r\n\r\n    Colors in Sunlight\r\n\r\nAbout the same time that he made his first discoveries regarding\r\ngravitation, he took up the study of light with a view to improving the\r\nconstruction of telescopes. His first experiment was to admit sunlight\r\ninto a darkened room through a circular hole in the shutter, and allow\r\nthis beam of light to pass through a glass prism to a white screen\r\nbeyond. He expected to see a round spot of light, but to his surprise\r\nthe light was drawn out into a band of brilliant colors.\r\n\r\nHe found that the light which comes from the sun is not a simple thing,\r\nbut is composed of colors, and these colors were separated by the glass\r\nprism. In the same way the colors of sunlight are separated by raindrops\r\nto form a rainbow. The colors may be again mingled together by passing\r\nthem through a second prism. They will then form a white light.\r\n\r\nSuppose that the light of the sun were not composed of different colors,\r\nthat all parts of white light were alike, then there would be no colors\r\nin nature. All the trees and flowers would have a dull, leaden hue, and\r\nthe human countenance would have the appearance of a pencil-sketch or a\r\nphotographic picture. The rainbow itself would dwindle into a narrow\r\narch of white light; the sun would shine through a gray sky, and the\r\nbeauty of the setting sun would be replaced by the gray of twilight\r\n(Fig. 11).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11--NEWTON'S EXPERIMENT WITH THE PRISM\r\n  Sunlight separated into the colors of the rainbow. The seven colors\r\nare: violet, indigo, blue, green, yellow, orange, red.]\r\n\r\nOne of Newton's inventions was a reflecting telescope--that is, a\r\ntelescope in which a curved mirror was used in place of a lens. He made\r\nsuch a telescope only six inches long, which would magnify forty times.\r\n\r\nNewton was a member of the Convention Parliament, which declared James\r\nII. to be no longer King of England and tendered the crown to William\r\nand Mary. He was made a knight by Queen Anne in 1705.\r\n\r\nHis knowledge of chemistry was used in the service of his country when\r\nhe was Master of the Mint. It was his duty to superintend the recoining\r\nof the money of England, which had been debased by dishonest officials\r\nat the mint. He did his work without fear or favor.\r\n\r\nOnce a bribe of £6000 ($30,000) was offered him. He refused it,\r\nwhereupon the agent who made the offer said to him that it came from a\r\ngreat duchess. Newton replied: \"Tell the lady that if she were here\r\nherself, and had made me this offer, I would have desired her to go out\r\nof my house; and so I desire you, or you shall be turned out.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough Newton's discoveries in the world of thought were among the\r\ngreatest ever made by man, he regarded them as insignificant compared\r\nwith the truth yet undiscovered. He said of himself: \"I do not know what\r\nI may appear to the world, but to myself I seem to have been only like a\r\nboy playing on the sea-shore and diverting myself in now and then\r\nfinding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than the ordinary, whilst\r\nthe great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter III\r\n\r\nTHE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY\r\n\r\n    James Watt and the Steam-Engine\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you had visited the coal-mines of England and Scotland three hundred\r\nyears ago, you might have seen women bending under baskets of coal\r\ntoiling up spiral stairways leading from the depths of the mines. At\r\nsome of the mines horses were used. A combination of windlass and\r\npulleys made it possible for a horse to lift a heavy bucket of coal.\r\nThere came a time, however, when slow and crude methods such as these\r\ncould not supply the coal as fast as it was needed. The shallower mines\r\nwere being exhausted. The mines must be dug deeper. The demand for coal\r\nwas increasing. The supply of coal, it was thought, would not last until\r\nthe end of the century. The wood supply was already exhausted. It seemed\r\nthat England was facing a fuel famine.\r\n\r\nThere was only one way out of the difficulty. A machine must be invented\r\nthat would do the work of the women and horses, a machine strong enough\r\nto raise coal with speed from the deepest mines. Then it happened that\r\ntwo great inventors, Newcomen and Watt, arose to produce the machine\r\nthat was needed. When the world needs an invention it seldom fails to\r\nappear. It is true of the world, as of an individual, that \"Necessity is\r\nthe mother of invention.\"\r\n\r\nIn the mean time Torricelli had performed his famous barometer\r\nexperiment, and Otto von Guericke had astonished princes with proofs of\r\nthe pressure of the air. There was no apparent connection between these\r\nexperiments and the art of coal-mining, yet these discoveries made\r\npossible the steam-engine which was to revolutionize first the\r\ncoal-mining industry and, later, the entire industrial world.\r\n\r\n    The First Steam-Engine with a Piston\r\n\r\nThe first steam-engine with a piston was made by Denys Papin, a\r\nFrenchman. Papin had observed that, in Guericke's experiment,\r\nair-pressure lifted several men off their feet. So he thought the air\r\ncould be made to lift heavy weights and do useful work. But how should\r\nhe produce the vacuum? His first thought was to explode gunpowder\r\nbeneath the piston. The gunpowder engine had been tried by others and\r\nfound wanting. He next turned his attention to steam, and discovered\r\nthat if the piston were forced up by steam and then the steam condensed,\r\na vacuum was formed beneath the piston, and air-pressure forced the\r\npiston to descend. If the piston were attached to a weight by a rope\r\npassing over a pulley, then, as the piston descended, it would lift the\r\nweight. Papin's engine consisted simply of a cylinder and piston (Fig.\r\n12). There was no boiler, but the water was placed in the cylinder\r\nbeneath the piston. A fire was placed under the cylinder and, as the\r\nwater boiled, the steam raised the piston. Then the fire was removed\r\nand, as the cylinder cooled, the steam condensed, and the piston was\r\nforced down by air-pressure. This was a slow and awkward method. The\r\nengine required several minutes to make one stroke.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12--PAPIN'S ENGINE\r\n  The first steam-engine with a piston. When the piston _B_ was forced\r\ndown by air-pressure, a weight was lifted by means of a rope _TT_\r\npassing over pulleys.]\r\n\r\nThe principle of Papin's engine was first successfully applied by Thomas\r\nNewcomen. Newcomen was a blacksmith by trade, and his great successor,\r\nWatt, was a mechanic. Thus we see that great discoveries soon become\r\ncommon property. The blacksmith and the mechanic soon learn to use the\r\ndiscoveries of the scientist.\r\n\r\n    Newcomen's Engine\r\n\r\nIn the Newcomen engine the piston moved a walking-beam to which was\r\nattached a pump-rod. Steam was used merely to balance the air-pressure\r\non the piston and allow the pump-rod to descend by its own weight. The\r\nsteam was condensed in the cylinder, and the pressure of the air forced\r\nthe piston down. Thus the work of raising water in the pump was done by\r\nthe air. Newcomen's first engine made twelve strokes a minute, and at\r\neach stroke lifted fifty gallons of water fifty yards. He used this\r\nengine in pumping water from the mines, and also made engines for\r\nlifting coal.\r\n\r\nAt first the steam was condensed by throwing cold water on the outside\r\nof the cylinder. But one day the engine suddenly increased its speed and\r\ncontinued to work with unusual rapidity. The upper side of the piston\r\nwas covered with water to make the piston air-tight, and it was found\r\nthat this water was entering the cylinder through a hole that had worn\r\nin the piston, and this jet of cold water was rapidly condensing the\r\nsteam. This was the origin of \"jet condensation.\"\r\n\r\nAfter this steam and water were alternately admitted to the cylinder\r\nthrough cocks turned by hand. A boy, Humphrey Potter, to whom this work\r\nwas intrusted, won fame by tying strings to the cocks in such a way that\r\nthe engine would turn the cocks itself and the boy, Humphrey, was free\r\nto play. This device was the origin of valve-gear.[1]\r\n\r\n[1] Any device by which a steam-engine operates the valves\r\nwhich admit steam to the cylinder is called \"valve-gear.\" One form of\r\nvalve-gear is the link motion invented by Stephenson. This form will be\r\ndescribed in connection with the locomotive. A simple valve-rod, worked\r\nby an eccentric such as is used on most stationary engines, is also a\r\nform of valve-gear.\r\n\r\nNewcomen's engine was extensively used. The tin and copper mines of\r\nCornwall were deepened. Coal-mines were sunk to twice the depth that had\r\nbeen possible. But as the mines were deepened the cost of running the\r\nengines increased. The largest engines consumed about $15,000 worth of\r\ncoal per year. The Newcomen engine required about twenty-eight pounds of\r\ncoal per hour per horse-power, while a modern engine consumes less than\r\ntwo pounds. Again, because of increased cost, mines were being\r\nabandoned. Such was the situation when James Watt came into the field of\r\naction.\r\n\r\nWatt had learned the mechanic's trade in one year in a London shop, and,\r\nbecause he had not passed through an apprenticeship of seven years, the\r\nGuild of Hammermen, a labor-union of his time, refused him admission,\r\nand this refusal meant no employment. He found shelter, however, in the\r\nUniversity of Glasgow, and was there provided with a small workshop\r\nwhere he could make instruments for sale.\r\n\r\n    Watt's Engine\r\n\r\nA small Newcomen engine belonging to the University of Glasgow was out\r\nof repair. London mechanics had failed to make it work. The job was\r\ngiven to Watt. That he might do a perfect piece of work on this engine,\r\nhe made a study of all that was then known relating to steam (Fig. 13).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13--THE NEWCOMEN ENGINE, IN REPAIRING WHICH WATT WAS\r\nLED TO HIS GREAT DISCOVERIES\r\n  Preserved in the University of Glasgow.]\r\n\r\nHe saw that there was a great loss of heat in admitting cold water into\r\nthe cylinder to condense the steam, and that, to prevent this loss, the\r\ncylinder must be kept always as hot as the steam that enters it. While\r\nthinking upon this problem the idea came to him that, if connection were\r\nmade between the cylinder and a tank from which the air had been\r\npumped out, the steam would rush into the tank, and might there be\r\ncondensed without cooling the cylinder. This was the origin of the\r\ncondenser.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that, in the Newcomen engine, the steam acted only on the\r\nunder side of the piston, air acting on the upper side. It occurred to\r\nWatt that the steam should act on both sides of the piston. So he\r\nproposed to put an air-tight cover on the cylinder with a hole and\r\nstuffing-box for the piston to slide through and to admit steam to act\r\nupon it instead of air. Thus he was led to invent the double-acting\r\nengine. The action in the cylinder of Watt's engine was the same as that\r\nof the modern engine.\r\n\r\nTo save the power of steam, Watt arranged the valve in his engine in\r\nsuch a way that the steam was cut off from the cylinder when the piston\r\nhad made about one-fourth of a stroke. The steam in the cylinder\r\ncontinues to expand and drive the piston. This device more than doubles\r\nthe amount of work that the steam will do (Fig. 14).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14--CYLINDER OF WATT'S STEAM-ENGINE\r\n  Arrows show the course of the steam.]\r\n\r\n    Horse-Power of an Engine\r\n\r\nWhen horses were about to be replaced by the steam-engine at the mines,\r\nthe question was asked: \"How many horses will the engine replace?\" Tests\r\nwere made by Watt and others before him of the rate at which a horse\r\ncould work in pumping water or in lifting a weight by means of a pulley.\r\nWatt's experiments showed that \"a good London horse could go on lifting\r\n150 pounds over a pulley at the rate of 2-1/2 miles an hour or 220 feet\r\nper minute, and continue the work eight hours a day.\" This would be\r\nequal to lifting 33,000 pounds one foot high every minute. This rate of\r\ndoing work he called a horse-power. It is more than the average horse\r\ncan do, but this number was used by Watt that he might give good measure\r\nin his engines. The horse-power of an engine at that time meant the rate\r\nof work in lifting water or coal. Now it means the rate of work done by\r\nthe steam upon the piston, so that to find the useful horse-power of an\r\nengine we must deduct the work wasted in friction.\r\n\r\nThe indicator for measuring the pressure of steam in the cylinder and\r\nthe fly-ball governor are also inventions made by Watt (Fig. 15). The\r\nfly-ball governor replaced the throttle-valve which was at first used by\r\nWatt to regulate the speed of his engines. The throttle-valve is still\r\nused on locomotives.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15--A FLY-BALL GOVERNOR\r\n  The balls as they rotate regulate the admission of steam to the\r\ncylinder by means of the lever _L_ and the rod _R_.]\r\n\r\nAt the end of the eighteenth century the steam-engine was full grown. It\r\nremained for the nineteenth century to apply the engine to locomotion on\r\nsea and land, to develop the steam-turbine, and so to increase the power\r\nof the steam-engine that, early in the twentieth century, a\r\n68,000-horse-power engine should speed an ocean liner across the\r\nAtlantic in five days.\r\n\r\n    The Leyden Jar\r\n\r\nThe first electrical invention of practical use was made by Benjamin\r\nFranklin. In Franklin's time great interest in electricity had been\r\naroused by the strange discovery of a German professor, Pieter van\r\nMusschenbroek, of the University of Leyden. This professor had tried\r\nwhat he called a new but terrible experiment. He had suspended by two\r\nsilk threads a gun-barrel which received electricity from an electrical\r\nmachine. From one end of the gun-barrel hung a brass wire. The lower end\r\nof this wire dipped in a jar of water. He held the jar in one hand,\r\nwhile with the other he tried to draw sparks from the gun-barrel.\r\nSuddenly he received a shock which seemed to him like a lightning\r\nstroke. So violent was the shock that he thought for a moment it would\r\nend his life.\r\n\r\nOut of this experiment came the Leyden jar, which for a century and a\r\nhalf was of no practical use, but which now forms an important part of\r\nevery wireless telegraph equipment. The Leyden jar is simply a glass\r\nbottle or jar coated with tin-foil both inside and outside (Fig. 16).\r\nWhen charged with electricity the jar will hold its charge until the two\r\ncoatings are connected by a metal wire or other good conductor of\r\nelectricity. A person may receive a strong shock by holding the jar in\r\none hand and touching a knob connected to the inner coating with the\r\nother hand.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16--A LEYDEN JAR]\r\n\r\nPopular interest in electricity was aroused by this discovery. The\r\nfriction electrical machine and the Leyden jar were simple and easy to\r\nmake. People of fashion found them interesting and amusing, the more so\r\nbecause of the shock felt on taking through the body the discharge from\r\nthe \"wonderful bottle,\" and the fact that several persons could receive\r\nthe shock at the same instant. On one occasion the Abbé Nollet\r\ndischarged a Leyden jar through a line composed of all the monks of the\r\nCarthusian Monastery in Paris. As the line of serious-faced monks a mile\r\nin length jumped into the air, the effect was ridiculous in the extreme.\r\n\r\n    Conductors and Insulators\r\n\r\nAbout this time other great electrical discoveries were made. Early in\r\nthe century, Stephen Gray discovered that some objects conduct\r\nelectricity and others do not. He discovered that, when a glass tube is\r\nelectrified by rubbing, it will attract and repel light objects. In the\r\nsame way a comb or penholder of rubber may be electrified by rubbing it\r\non the sleeve. A bit of paper which touches the comb becomes\r\nelectrified. Electricity can be transferred from one object to another.\r\nGray discovered further that contact is not necessary, that a hempen\r\nthread or a wire will carry an electric charge from one object to\r\nanother. A silk thread will not carry the electric charge. \"Some things\r\nconvey electricity,\" he said, \"and some do not, and those which do not\r\ncan be used to prevent the electricity escaping from those which do.\"\r\nCould this obscure inventor have seen a modern telegraph line with the\r\nglass insulators on the poles, which prevent the electric current\r\nescaping from the telegraph wire, he might have realized the importance\r\nof his discovery. He set up a line of hempen thread six hundred and\r\nfifty feet long, and with an electrical machine at one end of the line\r\nelectrified a boy suspended from the other end.\r\n\r\n    Two Kinds of Electric Charge\r\n\r\nA Frenchman, DuFay, while carrying further the experiments of Gray, was\r\nwatching a bit of gold-leaf floating in the air. The gold-leaf had been\r\nrepelled after contact with his electrified glass tube. Thinking to try\r\nthe action of two electrified objects on the gold leaf, he rubbed a\r\npiece of gum-copal and brought it near the leaf. To his astonishment the\r\nleaf, which was repelled by the glass tube, was attracted by the\r\ngum-copal. He repeated the experiment again and again, and each time the\r\nleaf was repelled by the glass and attracted by the gum. He concluded\r\nfrom this that there are two kinds of electricity, which he named\r\n\"vitreous\" and \"resinous.\" The two kinds of electric charge were called\r\nby Franklin \"positive\" and \"negative.\"\r\n\r\nFranklin made a battery of Leyden jars, connecting the inner coating of\r\none to the outer coating of the next throughout the series. In this way\r\nhe could get a much stronger spark than with a single jar. On one\r\noccasion he nearly lost his life by taking a shock from his battery of\r\nLeyden jars. He magnetized and demagnetized steel needles by passing\r\nthe discharge from his Leyden jars through the needles.\r\n\r\n    Franklin's Kite Experiment\r\n\r\nThe conjecture that lightning is of the same nature as the spark from\r\nthe Leyden jar or the electrical machine had gained a hold on the minds\r\nof others before Franklin. In France sparks had been drawn from a rod\r\nninety-nine feet high, but this did not reach into the clouds. Franklin\r\ndetermined to send a kite into a thunder-cloud, thinking electricity\r\nfrom the cloud would follow the string of the kite and could be stored\r\nin a Leyden jar, and used like the charge from an electrical machine. He\r\nhad felt the power of a Leyden-jar discharge, and through it had nearly\r\nlost his life. He knew that lightning is far more powerful than any\r\nbattery of Leyden jars, and yet to test the truth of his theory, that\r\nlightning is an electrical discharge, he was about to draw the lightning\r\nto his hand. He knew little of conductors of electricity. Whether the\r\ncord would draw little or much of the \"electric fire\" he knew not. So\r\nfar as he knew he was toying with death.\r\n\r\nThe kite was made of two light strips of cedar placed crosswise, and a\r\nlarge silk handkerchief fastened to the strips. A sharp wire about a\r\nfoot long was fastened to one of the strips. To the lower end of the\r\ncord he attached a key and a silk ribbon. By means of the ribbon he held\r\nthe cord to insulate it from his hand. The kite soared into the clouds,\r\nand Franklin and his son stood under a shed awaiting the coming of the\r\n\"electric fire\" (Fig. 17). Soon the fibres of the cord began to\r\nbristle up. He approached his knuckles to the key. A spark passed. He\r\nbrought up a Leyden jar and charged it with electricity from the cloud,\r\nand found that with this charge he could do everything that could be\r\ndone with electricity from his machine. He had proved the identity of\r\nlightning and electricity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17--FRANKLIN'S KITE EXPERIMENT\r\n  Taking electricity from the clouds.]\r\n\r\n    The Lightning-Rod\r\n\r\nSome time before, he had discovered the action of a point in discharging\r\nelectricity. He said: \"If you fix a needle to the end of a gun-barrel\r\nlike a little bayonet, while it remains there the gun-barrel cannot be\r\nelectrified so as to give a spark, for the electric fire continually\r\nruns out silently at the point.\" In the dark you may see a light gather\r\nupon the point like that of a firefly or glow-worm. If the needle is\r\nheld in the hand and brought near to an object charged with electricity,\r\nthe object is quietly discharged, and a light may be seen at the point\r\nof the needle. This action of points explains the light sometimes seen\r\non the tops of ships' masts, called by sailors \"Saint Elmo's fire,\" and\r\nperhaps, also, the observation of Cæsar that, in a certain African War,\r\nthe spears of the Fifth Roman Legion appeared tipped with fire.\r\n\r\nThe lightning-rod was the outcome of Franklin's observations, and this\r\nwas the first practical invention relating to electricity. A building\r\nmay be electrified by an electrified cloud passing over it. If the\r\nbuilding is protected by pointed rods, the electric charge will quietly\r\nescape from the points. The lower ends of the rods must be in the moist\r\nearth below the surface. The lightning-rod has not proved so great a\r\nprotection as Franklin supposed it would. He supposed that a\r\nlightning-stroke is a discharge in one direction only; but we now know\r\nthat it is a rapid surging back and forth, and this fact accounts for\r\nthe failure of the lightning-rods to furnish perfect protection. In\r\nsurging back and forth, the lightning may skip from the lightning-rod to\r\nsome metal object within the building, as a stove or radiator. The\r\nlightning-rod robbed the thunder-storm of its terrors to the timid, and\r\nin time dispelled the superstition of people who believed that thunder\r\nand lightning are evidence of the wrath of the Deity.\r\n\r\nFranklin was the first to propose an answer to the question: What is\r\nelectricity? He believed electricity to be a subtle fluid existing in\r\nall objects. If an object has more than a certain amount of this fluid,\r\nit is positively electrified; if less than this amount, it is negatively\r\nelectrified.\r\n\r\nThe \"one-fluid\" theory of Franklin was soon met by the \"two-fluid\"\r\ntheory proposed by Robert Symmer, for Franklin's theory had failed to\r\nexplain why two bodies negatively electrified should repel each other.\r\nAccording to Symmer, an uncharged body contains an equal quantity of two\r\ndifferent electrical fluids. An excess of one of these produces a\r\npositive charge, an excess of the other a negative charge.\r\n\r\nSymmer's experiments are almost ludicrous. He wore two pairs of silk\r\nstockings, and found that white and black silk worn together became\r\nstrongly electrified. When the two stockings worn on one foot were\r\npulled off together, and then separated, they were found to be\r\nelectrified, and attracted each other so strongly that a force of about\r\none pound was required to separate them. The two charges, negative and\r\npositive, could, however, be separated. He thought, therefore, that\r\nthere are \"two electrical powers,\" not one, as Franklin believed. His\r\nbelief was strengthened by examining a quire of paper through which an\r\nelectric spark had passed, and finding that \"the edges of the holes were\r\nbent two different ways, as if the hole had been made in the quire by\r\ndrawing two threads in contrary directions through it.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a long controversy regarding the two theories, and neither\r\nquite gained possession of the field. Each contained some truth, and\r\neach had its weak points. The two had more in common than men at that\r\ntime thought.\r\n\r\n    Galvani and the Electric Current\r\n\r\nFranklin had proven that there is electricity in the atmosphere, and\r\nthat lightning is an electric discharge. A widespread interest in the\r\nelectricity of the atmosphere followed this discovery. Aloisio Galvani,\r\na physician in Bologna, Italy, in attempting to learn the effect of\r\natmospheric electricity on the nerves and muscles of the human body,\r\nmade a discovery which led to the electric battery and a knowledge of\r\nelectric currents.\r\n\r\nHaving dissected a frog, he laid it on a table on which stood an\r\nelectrical machine. When one of his assistants touched lightly the nerve\r\nof the thigh with the point of a knife while a spark was drawn from the\r\nelectrical machine, the muscles contracted violently, as if they were\r\nattacked by a cramp. When he held the knife by the bone handle, there\r\nwas no convulsion as there was when he held it by the steel blade.\r\n\r\nHe next thought it important to find out if lightning would excite\r\ncontraction of the muscles. He stretched and insulated a long iron wire\r\nin the open air on the housetop and, as a storm drew near, hung on it a\r\ndissected frog. To the feet he fastened another long iron wire, which\r\nwas allowed to dip in the water in the well. \"The result,\" he said,\r\n\"came about as we wished. As often as the lightning broke forth, the\r\nmuscles were thrown into repeated violent convulsions, so that always,\r\nas the lightning lightened the sky, the muscle contractions and\r\nmovements preceded the thunder and, as it were, announced its coming. It\r\nwas best, however, when the lightning was strong, or the clouds from\r\nwhich it broke forth were near the place of the experiment.\"\r\n\r\nHe describes his greatest experiment as follows: \"After we had\r\ninvestigated the power of atmospheric electricity in storms, our hearts\r\nburned with the desire to investigate the daily quiet electricity of the\r\natmosphere. Therefore, as the prepared frogs, hung on an iron railing\r\nwhich surrounded a hanging garden on our house, with brass hooks\r\ninserted in the spinal cord, fell into convulsions not only when it\r\nlightened, but when the sky was calm and clear, I thought that the cause\r\nof these contractions was the changes in the electricity of the\r\natmosphere. Then for hours, yes, even days, I observed the animals, but\r\nalmost never a movement of the muscles could be seen. At last, tired\r\nwith such fruitless waiting, I began to press the brass hooks, which\r\nwere fastened in the spinal cord, against the iron railing to see if\r\nsuch a trick would cause the muscles to contract, and if instead of\r\nchanges in the atmospheric electricity any other changes would have any\r\ninfluence. I observed, indeed, vigorous contractions, but none which\r\ncould be caused by the condition of the atmosphere.\"\r\n\r\nIt was pressing the brass hook against the iron railing, thus forming an\r\nelectric battery, that caused electricity to pass through the muscles of\r\nthe frog. Galvani did not know that he had discovered a new source of\r\nelectricity. He never arrived at a correct explanation of his results,\r\nand never knew the value of his discovery.\r\n\r\n    Volta and the Electric Battery\r\n\r\nIt was left for Alexander Volta to show that, in Galvani's experiment,\r\nthe muscles of the frog, together with the brass hook and the iron\r\nrailing, formed an electric battery. Volta showed that an electric\r\ncharge can be produced merely by bringing two different metals into\r\ncontact. He found that, if he placed copper and zinc in sulphuric acid,\r\nor a solution of common salt, he could, produce a continuous flow of\r\nelectricity (Fig. 18).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18--VOLTA EXPLAINING HIS ELECTRIC BATTERY TO\r\nNAPOLEON BONAPARTE\r\n  From a painting. Photo by Dubray.]\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of the year 1800 Volta made the first electric battery\r\n(Fig. 19). It was made of copper and zinc disks placed alternately, with\r\na piece of wet cloth above each pair of disks. With his column of disks\r\nhe could obtain a strong shock; indeed, many shocks, one after the\r\nother. This first battery of Volta's was a form of \"dry battery.\" Later\r\nVolta devised his \"crown of cups,\" a form of wet battery similar to\r\nsome batteries in use to-day. Each cup contained a strip of copper and a\r\nstrip of zinc in dilute sulphuric acid.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19--THE FIRST ELECTRIC BATTERY\r\n    No. 1--A battery of one hundred pairs of copper and zinc disks.\r\n    No. 2--Two such batteries connected.\r\n  By permission of the Italian Institute of Graphic Arts, Bergamo.]\r\n\r\nVolta did not know the real use of the liquid in his battery, nor that\r\nthe strength of the current depends on the rate at which the metal is\r\ndissolved by the acid; but he had discovered the electric current, and\r\nwith this discovery began a new era in electrical invention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IV\r\n\r\nFARADAY AND THE FIRST DYNAMO\r\n\r\n\r\nMichael Faraday, a London newsboy, the son of a blacksmith, became the\r\ninventor of the dynamo, and prepared the way for the wonderful\r\nelectrical inventions of the nineteenth century. He began his career as\r\na book-binder's apprentice, employing his spare moments in reading the\r\nbooks he was binding. One of these books led him to make some simple\r\nexperiments in chemistry. He also made an electrical machine, first with\r\na glass bottle, and afterward with a glass cylinder.\r\n\r\nWhile an apprentice he wrote to his young friend, Benjamin Abbott: \"I\r\nhave lately made a few simple galvanic experiments, merely to illustrate\r\nto myself the first principles of the science. I was going to Knight's\r\nto obtain some nickel, and bethought me that they had malleable zinc. I\r\ninquired, and bought some--have you seen any yet? The first portion I\r\nobtained was in the thinnest pieces possible. It was, they informed me,\r\nthin enough for the electric stick. I obtained it for the purpose of\r\nforming disks with which and copper to make a little battery. The first\r\nI completed contained the immense number of seven pairs of plates!!! and\r\nof the immense size of halfpence each!!!!!! I, sir, I my own self, cut\r\nout seven disks of the size of half pennies each! I, sir, covered them\r\nwith seven halfpence, and I interposed between them seven, or rather\r\nsix, pieces of paper soaked in a solution of muriate of soda (common\r\nsalt). But laugh no longer, dear A., rather wonder at the effects this\r\ntrivial power produced.\"\r\n\r\nThis tiny battery made of half pennies with zinc disks and salt solution\r\nwould decompose a certain solution which Faraday tested. A larger\r\nbattery made of copper and zinc disks with salt solution would decompose\r\nwater from the cistern. When the wires from the larger battery were put\r\nin the cistern-water he saw a dense white cloud descending from the\r\npositive wire, and bubbles rising from the negative wire. This action\r\ncontinued until all the white substance was taken out of the water.\r\n\r\nBecause of his interest in science, young Faraday attracted the\r\nattention of a Mr. Dance, a member of the Royal Institution and a\r\ncustomer of his master, Mr. Riebau. Through the kindness of Mr. Dance he\r\nheard four lectures by Sir Humphry Davy. He took notes on the lectures,\r\nwrote them out carefully, and added drawings of the apparatus. These\r\nnotes he sent to Davy with a letter expressing the wish that he might\r\nsecure employment at the Royal Institution. In a short time, after a\r\nwarning from Sir Humphry that he had better stick to his business of\r\nbook-binding, that \"Science is a harsh mistress,\" his wish was granted,\r\nand we find him cleaning and caring for apparatus in the Royal\r\nInstitution and assisting Davy in preparing for his lectures.\r\n\r\n    Count Rumford\r\n\r\nOur story now takes us back to the time of the American Revolution. In\r\nAmerica, we find a young man of nineteen, Benjamin Thompson by name,\r\nserving as major in the Second Regiment of New Hampshire. The\r\nappointment of so young a man as major, and his evident hold on the\r\ngovernor's favor, aroused the jealousy of the older officers. He was\r\naccused of being unfriendly to the cause of liberty. He denied the\r\ncharge, and was acquitted by the committee of the people of Concord. A\r\nmob gathered round his house, but he escaped. Driven from his refuge in\r\nhis mother's home, he fled to England, leaving his wife and child.\r\nAppointed lieutenant-colonel in the British Army, he returned to America\r\nand fought against his former friends.\r\n\r\nThe war having ended, he returned to England, thence to the Continent,\r\nintending to take part in an expected war between Austria and Turkey. A\r\nchance meeting with a Bavarian prince, Maximilian, changed the course of\r\nhis life. This prince, while commanding on parade, saw Thompson among\r\nthe spectators mounted on a fine English horse, and addressed him.\r\nThompson informed him that he came from serving in the American war. The\r\nprince, pointing to a number of his officers, said: \"These gentlemen\r\nwere in the same war, but against you. They belonged to the Royal\r\nRegiment of Deux Ponts, that acted in America under the orders of Count\r\nRochambeau.\" Thompson dined with the prince and French officers. They\r\nconversed of war and the battles in which they met. The prince,\r\nattracted to the colonel, induced him to pass through Munich, and gave\r\nhim a letter to his uncle, the Elector of Bavaria.\r\n\r\nIt was in Bavaria, the country to which such unexpected turns of fortune\r\nled him, that his greatest work was done. He entered the service of the\r\nDuke of Bavaria as aide-de-camp. It was his aim while in the service of\r\nthe Bavarian Government to better the condition of the people. He\r\nintroduced reforms in the army, used the soldiers to rid the country of\r\nbeggars and robbers, and took steps to provide for the infirm and find\r\nemployment for the strong, his motto being that people can best be made\r\nvirtuous when first made happy.\r\n\r\nA Military Workhouse was opened for the beggars, and a House of Industry\r\nfor the poor. A Military Academy was formed with a view to the free\r\neducation of young people of talent for the public service. He became\r\nabsorbed in the one aim of helping the poor. So thorough was his\r\ndevotion to the people, and so deeply did he win their affection, that\r\nwhen he was dangerously ill a multitude of hundreds went in procession\r\nto the church to make public prayers for his recovery.\r\n\r\nHe saw that the poor may be helped by teaching them to save, and in\r\nnothing is there greater need of saving than in fuel and heat. In the\r\nkitchens of the Military Academy and the House of Industry he carried\r\nout a series of experiments on the economy of fuel, and succeeded in\r\ngreatly reducing the amount of fuel needed for cooking the food. He did\r\nthis by using a \"closed fireplace,\" the forerunner of the stove. The\r\nclosed fireplace was in reality a brick stove, and was a great\r\nimprovement over the open chimney fireplaces then in common use. He\r\nmade the covers of the cooking utensils double, to save the heat, for he\r\nhad found that heat cannot escape through confined air.\r\n\r\nBenjamin Thompson was knighted by George III., and in 1791 he was made a\r\nCount of the Holy Roman Empire, and is known to the world of science as\r\nCount Rumford.\r\n\r\n    Count Rumford's Experiment with the Cannon\r\n\r\nWhile in the service of the Duke of Bavaria, it became his duty to\r\norganize the field artillery. To provide cannon for this purpose, he\r\nerected a foundry and machine-shops. Being alert for any unusual fact\r\nrelating to heat, he observed the very high temperature produced by the\r\nboring of the cannon. He was eager to learn how so much heat could be\r\nproduced. For this purpose he took a cannon in the rough, as it came\r\nfrom the foundry, fixed it in the machine used for boring, and caused\r\nthe cannon to be turned by horses while a blunt borer was forced against\r\nthe end of the cannon. He first tested the temperature of the metal\r\nitself as it turned. Then he surrounded the end of the cannon with water\r\nin an oblong box fitted water-tight (Fig. 20).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20--COUNT RUMFORD'S EXPERIMENT WITH THE CANNON,\r\nMAKING WATER BOIL WITHOUT FIRE\r\n  The horses make the water boil by walking around the track; the work\r\nthe horses do is changed into heat by the friction of the drill.]\r\n\r\nThe cannon had been turning but a short time when he found by putting\r\nhis hand in the water that heat had been produced. In two hours and\r\nthirty minutes the water actually boiled. Astonishment was expressed in\r\nthe faces of the bystanders on seeing so large a quantity of water\r\nheated and actually made to boil without any fire.\r\n\r\n\"Heat,\" Count Rumford said; \"may thus be produced merely by the strength\r\nof a horse, and, in case of necessity, this heat might be used in\r\ncooking victuals. But no circumstance can be imagined in which there is\r\nany advantage in this method of procuring heat, for more heat might be\r\nobtained by burning the fodder which the horse would eat.\" The meaning\r\nof this last remark was not understood until the time of Robert Mayer,\r\nabout fifty years later. Rumford had found that the work of a horse can\r\nproduce heat, and heat, in a steam-engine, can do the work of a horse.\r\nThus surely, though slowly, men were learning of the forces that move\r\nthe world and do man's bidding.\r\n\r\nCount Rumford, true to his adopted land, returned to London and became\r\nthe founder of the Royal Institution in which Faraday and his successors\r\nhave achieved such marvellous results. He believed that the poor can be\r\nhelped in no better way than by giving them knowledge, so that they can\r\nbetter their own condition. For this purpose he founded the Royal\r\nInstitution. Here he intended that men skilled in discovery should gain\r\nnew knowledge that would add to the comfort and happiness of the people.\r\n\r\n    Davy\r\n\r\nIn the English coal-fields many accidents due to the burning of\r\nfire-damp had occurred. Fire-damp is caused by gas issuing from the\r\ncoal. On the approach of a flame this gas catches fire, and as it burns\r\nit produces a violent wind, driving the flame before it through the\r\nmine. Miners were scorched to death, suffocated, or buried under ruins\r\nfrom the roof. Hundreds of miners had been killed. No means of lighting\r\nthe mines in safety had been devised. Sir Humphry Davy, Professor of\r\nChemistry in the Royal Institution, was appealed to. After many\r\nexperiments he devised a \"safe lamp,\" which was a common miner's lamp\r\nenclosed in a wire gauze. This proved a perfect protection from\r\nfire-damp, and the Davy safety lamp has been used by miners the world\r\nover for more than a century.\r\n\r\nBut Davy's best work was with the electric battery. Some of the facts\r\nmost familiar to us were discovered by him. Volta had contended that the\r\ncontact of the metals in a battery produces a current, that the liquid\r\nmerely carries the electricity from one metal plate to the other. But\r\nDavy proved that there can be no current without chemical action.\r\nWhenever we put two metals in an acid or other solution that will\r\ndissolve one metal faster than the other, and connect the metals with a\r\nwire, an electric current is produced. If we use water with silver and\r\ngold, there is no current, because water will not dissolve either the\r\nsilver or the gold.\r\n\r\nDavy discovered the metal, potassium, by means of his electric battery.\r\nPotassium is found in common potash and saltpetre, and, when separated,\r\nis a very soft metal. The newly discovered metal aroused great interest\r\nin other countries. When Napoleon heard of it, he inquired impetuously\r\nhow it happened the discovery had not been made in France. On being told\r\nthat in France there had not been made an electric battery of sufficient\r\npower, he exclaimed: \"Then let one be instantly made without regard to\r\ncost or labor.\" His command was obeyed, and he was called to witness the\r\naction of the new battery. Before any one could interfere he placed the\r\nends of the wires under his tongue and received a shock that nearly\r\ndeprived him of sensation. On recovering he left the laboratory without\r\na word, and was never afterward heard to refer to the subject.\r\n\r\nDavy made many great discoveries, but the greatest was his discovery of\r\nFaraday.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA journey on the Continent with Davy was an event in the life of\r\nFaraday, who up to that time had never to his own recollection travelled\r\ntwelve miles from London. On this journey he met Volta, whom he\r\ndescribes as \"an hale elderly man, very free in conversation.\" He\r\nvisited the Academy del Cimento, in Florence, and wrote: \"Here was much\r\nto excite interest; in one place was Galileo's first telescope, that\r\nwith which he discovered Jupiter's satellites. It was a simple tube of\r\nwood and paper, about three and a half feet long, with a lens at each\r\nend. There was also the first lens which Galileo made. It was set in a\r\nvery pretty frame of brass, with an inscription in Latin on it.\"\r\n\r\nFaraday crossed the Alps and the Apennines, climbed Vesuvius, visited\r\nRome, and _saw a glow-worm_. The last he thought as wonderful as the\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\nShortly after his return to London he fell in love. Now, Faraday had\r\ndetermined that he would not be conquered by the master passion. In\r\nfact, he had written various aspersions on love, of which the following\r\nis a sample:\r\n\r\n    \"What is the pest and plague of human life?\r\n    And what the curse that often brings a wife?\r\n                    'Tis Love.\r\n\r\n    What is't directs the madman's hot intent,\r\n    For which a dunce is fully competent?\r\n    What's that the wise man always strives to shun,\r\n    Though still it ever o'er the world has run.\r\n                    'Tis Love.\"\r\n\r\nBut he reckoned not with his own heart. It is not long until we find him\r\nwriting to Miss Sarah Barnard, a bright girl of twenty-one: \"You have\r\nconverted me from one erroneous way, let me hope you will attempt to\r\ncorrect what others are wrong.... Again and again I attempt to say what\r\nI feel, but I cannot. Let me, however, claim not to be the selfish being\r\nthat wishes to bend your affections for his own sake only. In whatever\r\nway I can minister to your happiness, either by close attention or by\r\nabsence, it shall be done. Do not injure me by withdrawing your\r\nfriendship or punish me for aiming to be more than a friend by making me\r\nless.\"\r\n\r\nThey were married and lived in rooms at the Royal Institution. No poet\r\never loved more tenderly than Faraday. Truly, science does not dry up\r\nthe heart's blood. At the age of seventy-one he wrote to his wife while\r\nabsent from home for a few days: \"Remember me; I think as much of you as\r\nis good for either you or me. We cannot well do without each other. But\r\nwe love with a strong hope of love continuing ever.\"\r\n\r\n    Faraday's Electrical Discoveries\r\n\r\nNow we shall turn to Faraday's electrical discoveries and inventions.\r\nMen had long known that, in houses that have been struck by lightning,\r\nsteel objects such as knives and needles are sometimes found to be\r\nmagnetized. Ships struck by lightning had found their compass-needles\r\npointing south instead of north, or wandering in direction and\r\nworthless. Men had wondered how an electrical discharge could magnetize\r\nsteel. They had tried the spark of the electrical machine with no\r\ndefinite result. Franklin, in his experiment of magnetizing a steel\r\nneedle by passing an electric spark through it, could not tell before\r\nthe spark was passed through the needle which end would be the north\r\npole. There was no seeming connection between the direction of the\r\nelectric discharge and the polarity of the needle. After the discovery\r\nof the electric battery, men tried to discover a relation between the\r\nelectric current and magnetism.\r\n\r\n    Oersted and Electromagnetism\r\n\r\nThe first success in this direction was achieved by Hans Christian\r\nOersted, a native of Denmark. Poverty impelled his father to take him\r\nfrom school at the age of twelve and place him in an apothecary's shop.\r\nThe boy, Hans, found delight in the chemical work of the apothecary. His\r\neagerness to learn and the pressure of poverty led him to neglect the\r\nusual sports of boyhood and devote his leisure time to reading and\r\nstudy. Again he entered school, and, though paying his way by his own\r\nwork, he graduated with honor from the University of Copenhagen. He was\r\nappointed Professor of Physics in this university, and here he made his\r\nfirst great discovery in electromagnetism.\r\n\r\nAfter working for seven years to discover a relation between current\r\nelectricity and magnetism, he made a discovery which proved to be the\r\nfirst step in the invention of the dynamo. He was using a magnetic\r\ncompass, which is a small magnetic needle balanced on a steel point. The\r\nneedle points nearly north and south unless disturbed by a magnet\r\nbrought near it. He had tried to find if a wire through which a current\r\nis flowing would disturb the compass as a magnet does. He had tried\r\nplacing the wire east and west, thinking the compass-needle would follow\r\nthe wire as it does a magnet. One day, while lecturing to his students,\r\nit occurred to him for the first time to place the wire north and south\r\nover the compass-needle. He was surprised and perplexed as he did so to\r\nsee the needle swing round and point nearly east and west (Fig. 21). On\r\nreversing the current the needle swung in the opposite direction. He had\r\ndiscovered the magnetic action of an electric current. It was learned\r\nsoon afterward that a coil of wire with an electric current flowing\r\nthrough it acts like a magnet, and that a current flowing around a bar\r\nof soft iron makes the iron a magnet (Figs. 22 and 23).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 21--OERSTED'S EXPERIMENT\r\n  An electric current flowing over the compass-needle toward the north\r\ncauses the needle to turn until it points nearly west.\r\n  By permission of Joseph G. Branch.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 22.--A COIL WITH A CURRENT FLOWING THROUGH IT ACTS\r\nLIKE A MAGNET\r\n  The coil is picking up iron filings.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 23--A BAR OF SOFT IRON WITH A CURRENT FLOWING AROUND\r\nIT BECOMES A MAGNET]\r\n\r\n    Ampère\r\n\r\nThe news of Oersted's discovery aroused great interest throughout\r\nEurope. Soon after its announcement in France, André Marie Ampère made a\r\ndiscovery of equal importance. Oersted had discovered electromagnetism.\r\nAmpère discovered electrical power or motion produced by an electrical\r\ncurrent.\r\n\r\nThe youth of Ampère was passed amid the stormy scenes of the French\r\nRevolution. His father had moved from his country home to Lyons and\r\nbecome a justice of the peace. In the destruction of the city of Lyons\r\nduring the Reign of Terror he lost his head under the guillotine.\r\n\r\nThe blow was too great for Ampère, then a youth of eighteen. He had been\r\na precocious child, advanced beyond his years in all the studies of the\r\nschools. But now his strong mind failed. For a year he wandered about\r\nmechanically piling up heaps of sand or gazing upon the sky. Then his\r\nmental power returned, and he took up with eagerness the study of botany\r\nand poetry.\r\n\r\nHe became a professor in the Polytechnic School in Paris, and it was\r\nwhile teaching in this school that he made his great discoveries. He\r\nfound that two coils of wire can be made to attract or repel each other\r\nby an electric current. If the current flows through the two coils in\r\nthe same direction, they attract each other (Fig. 24). If the current\r\nflows in opposite directions through the coils, they repel each other\r\n(Fig. 25). This is not very strange to us, for we know that a coil with\r\na current flowing through it acts just like a magnet. Each coil then has\r\na north pole and a south pole. If the coils are placed so that the two\r\nnorth poles or the two south poles are together, they will repel each\r\nother. If the north pole of one coil is near the south pole of the\r\nother, they will attract each other.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 24--TWO COILS WITH CURRENTS FLOWING IN SAME\r\nDIRECTION ATTRACT EACH OTHER]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 25--TWO COILS WITH CURRENTS FLOWING IN OPPOSITE\r\nDIRECTIONS REPEL EACH OTHER]\r\n\r\nAmpère believed that electric currents are flowing around within the\r\nearth, and that the earth has a north and a south magnetic pole for the\r\nsame reason that a coil of wire has magnetic poles; that these poles are\r\ncaused by the currents flowing around in the earth just as the poles of\r\nthe coil are caused by the current flowing around in the coil.\r\n\r\nWe do honor to the name of Ampère whenever we measure an electric\r\ncurrent, for electric currents are measured in \"amperes.\"\r\n\r\n    Arago\r\n\r\nAnother important discovery was made by a young Frenchman, François\r\nArago, within a year of the time when Oersted and Ampère made their\r\ndiscoveries. The three great discoveries of these men were made in the\r\nyears 1819 and 1820. The youth of Arago was full of adventure. He had\r\nassisted in making a survey in the Pyrenees, the haunt of daring\r\nrobber-bands. Twice in his cabin he was visited by a chief of a\r\nrobber-band who claimed to be a custom-house guard. On the second visit\r\nhe said to the robber: \"Your position is perfectly known to me. I know\r\nthat you are not a custom-house guard. I have learned that you are the\r\nchief of the robbers of the country. Tell me whether I have anything to\r\nfear from your confederates.\" The robber replied: \"The idea of robbing\r\nyou did occur to us; but, on the day that we molested an envoy from the\r\nFrench, they would direct against us several regiments of soldiers, and\r\nwe are not so strong as they. Allow me to add that the gratitude which I\r\nowe you for the night's shelter is your surest guarantee.\"\r\n\r\nAt a later time, when war between Spain and France was threatened, he\r\nwas accused of being a spy, and a mob was formed to put him out of the\r\nway. He escaped in disguise through the midst of the mob and boarded a\r\nSpanish ship. He was carried to Morocco, ran the gantlet of bloodthirsty\r\nMussulmans in Algiers, escaped death by a hair's-breadth, and through it\r\nall clung to the papers which recorded the results of the survey in the\r\nmountains, and delivered them in safety to the office of the Bureau of\r\nLongitude in Paris.\r\n\r\nArago made a discovery which, with those of Oersted and Ampère, prepared\r\nthe way for Faraday's great electrical discoveries and the invention of\r\nthe dynamo. He found that a plate of copper whirling above or below a\r\nmagnetic needle will draw the needle after it (Fig. 26). He could make\r\nthe speed of the whirling copper plate so great that the needle would\r\nwhirl rapidly, following the copper plate. Faraday was the first to\r\nexplain Arago's experiment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 26--ARAGO'S EXPERIMENT\r\n  When the copper plate whirls the magnet whirls also, though it does\r\nnot touch the copper plate.]\r\n\r\n    Faraday's First Electric Motor\r\n\r\nFaraday's first electrical discovery was made soon after that of Arago.\r\nOersted had proven that an electric current acts on a magnet. The magnet\r\nturns at right angles to the wire. Faraday saw that this is because the\r\nnorth pole of the magnet tries to go round the wire in one direction,\r\nand the south pole tries to go round in the opposite direction. He\r\nplaced a magnet on end in a dish of mercury, with one pole of the magnet\r\nabove the mercury, and found that the magnet would spin round a wire\r\ncarrying a current. When the current acts on one pole of the magnet\r\nonly, the magnet spins round the wire (Fig. 27). So Faraday's first\r\nelectrical discovery prepared the way for the electric motor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 27--ONE POLE OF A MAGNET SPINS ROUND A WIRE THROUGH\r\nWHICH AN ELECTRIC CURRENT FLOWS]\r\n\r\n    An Electric Current Produced by a Magnet\r\n\r\nHe had written in his note-book: \"Convert magnetism into electricity.\"\r\nAn electric current would magnetize iron. Would not a magnet produce an\r\nelectric current? This was his problem.\r\n\r\nHe connected a coil of wire to an instrument that would tell when a\r\ncurrent was flowing, and placed a magnet in the coil. Others had\r\nclaimed, and Faraday at first believed, that a current would flow while\r\nthe magnet lay quiet within the coil. But Faraday was alert for the\r\nunexpected, and the unexpected happened. For an instant, as he thrust\r\nthe magnet into the coil, his instrument showed that a current was\r\nflowing. Again, as he drew the magnet quickly from the coil, a current\r\nflowed, but in the opposite direction (Fig. 28). From this simple\r\nexperiment has grown the alternating-current machinery by which the\r\npower of Niagara is made to light cities and drive electric cars at a\r\ndistance of many miles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 28--WHEN A MAGNET IS THRUST INTO A COIL OF WIRE IT\r\nCAUSES A CURRENT TO FLOW IN THE COIL, BUT THE CURRENT FLOWS ONLY WHILE\r\nTHE MAGNET IS MOVING\r\n  Drawing reproduced by permission of Joseph G. Branch.]\r\n\r\nA friend of Faraday, on learning of this discovery, wrote the following\r\nimpromptu lines:\r\n\r\n    \"Around the magnet Faraday\r\n    Was sure that Volta's lightnings play.\r\n      But how to draw them from the wire?\r\n    He took a lesson from the heart:\r\n    'Tis when we meet, 'tis when we part,\r\n      Breaks forth the electric fire.\"\r\n\r\nA magnet will produce an electric current in a wire, but only when the\r\nmagnet or the wire is in motion.\r\n\r\n    Detecting and Measuring an Electric Current\r\n\r\nThe instrument which Faraday used to detect a current was derived from\r\nOersted's experiment. When a current flows in a north-and-south\r\ndirection over a compass-needle, the needle swings round. When the\r\ncurrent stops flowing the needle swings back to the north-and-south\r\nposition. The effect on the needle is stronger if the current flows\r\nthrough a coil of wire and the coil is placed in a north-and-south\r\nposition around the needle (Fig. 29). The stronger the current flowing\r\nthrough the coil the farther the needle will turn from the\r\nnorth-and-south position.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 29--A COIL OF WIRE AROUND A COMPASS-NEEDLE\r\n  The needle tells when a current is flowing, and how strong the current\r\nis.]\r\n\r\nThe coil and the needle together are called a galvanometer, and may be\r\nused to tell when a current is flowing, and also to indicate the\r\nstrength of the current.\r\n\r\n    An Electric Current Produced by the Magnetic Field of Another Current\r\n\r\nFaraday had found that a current flowing around a piece of iron will\r\nmake the iron a magnet, and that a magnet in motion will cause a current\r\nto flow in a wire. It seemed to him that a second wire placed near the\r\nfirst should have a current produced in it without the presence of iron.\r\nHe wound two coils of copper wire upon the same wooden spool. The wire\r\nof the two coils he separated with twine and calico. One coil was\r\nconnected with a galvanometer, the other with a battery of ten cells,\r\nyet not the slightest turning of the needle could be observed. But he\r\nwas not deterred by one failure. He raised his battery from ten cells to\r\none hundred cells, but without avail. The current flowed calmly through\r\nthe battery wire without producing, during its flow, any effect upon the\r\ngalvanometer. During its flow was the time when an effect was expected.\r\n\r\nAgain the unexpected happened. At the instant of making contact with the\r\nbattery there was a slight movement of the needle. When the contact was\r\nbroken, another slight movement, but in the opposite direction to the\r\nfirst (Fig. 30). The current in one wire caused a current to flow in the\r\nother, but the current in the second wire continued for an instant only\r\nat the making and breaking of the contact with the battery. This was the\r\nbeginning of the induction-coil used to-day in wireless telegraphy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 30--FARADAY'S INDUCTION-COIL\r\n  Starting and stopping the battery current in the primary coil causes a\r\nchanging magnetic field, and this causes a current to flow in the\r\nsecondary coil.\r\n  Drawing reproduced by permission of Joseph G. Branch.]\r\n\r\nWhat was the secret of it? Simply this: that a current in one wire will\r\ncause a current to flow in another wire near it, but only while the\r\ncurrent in the first wire is changing. That is, at the instant when the\r\nfirst wire is connected to the battery, or its connection broken, a\r\ncurrent is induced in the second wire. There is no battery or other\r\nsource of current connected to the second wire; but a current flows in\r\nthis wire because it is near a wire in which a current is rapidly\r\nstarting and stopping. When these two wires are wound in coils, together\r\nthey form an induction-coil. The wire which we have called the first\r\nwire forms the \"primary\" coil, and the one we have called the second\r\nwire forms the \"secondary\" coil. By repeatedly making and breaking the\r\ncircuit in the primary coil we get an alternating current in the\r\nsecondary coil. Fig. 31 is from a photograph of some of the coils\r\nactually used by Faraday.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 31--HISTORICAL APPARATUS OF FARADAY IN THE ROYAL\r\nINSTITUTION\r\n  Some of Faraday's transformer coils are shown here. The instrument on\r\nthe left in a glass case is his galvanometer.]\r\n\r\n    Faraday's Dynamo\r\n\r\nTo invent a new electrical machine was Faraday's next aim. Arago's disk\r\nof copper whirling near a magnet had a current induced in it, so Faraday\r\nthought. It was the action of this induced current which caused the\r\nmagnet to follow the whirling disk. Could the current in Arago's disk be\r\ncollected and caused to flow through a wire? He placed a copper disk\r\nbetween the poles of a magnet. One galvanometer wire passed around the\r\naxis of the disk, the other he held in contact with the edge. He whirled\r\nthe disk. The galvanometer needle moved. A current was flowing in the\r\ndisk as it whirled. The current from the whirling disk flowed through\r\nthe galvanometer. Faraday had discovered the dynamo (Fig. 32).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 32--FARADAY'S FIRST DYNAMO\r\n  A current flows in the copper disk as it whirls between the poles of\r\nthe magnet.\r\n  By permission of Joseph G. Branch.]\r\n\r\nAll this work occupied but ten days in the autumn of 1831, though years\r\nof preparation had gone before. In these ten days the foundation was\r\nlaid for the induction-coil, modern dynamo-electric machinery, and\r\nelectric lighting. Fig. 33 shows the laboratory in which Faraday did\r\nthis work.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 33--FARADAY'S LABORATORY, WHERE THE FIRST DYNAMO WAS\r\nMADE\r\n  From the water-color drawing by Miss Harriet Moore.]\r\n\r\nFaraday continued to explore the field opened up before him. In one\r\nexperiment two small pencils of charcoal lightly touching were connected\r\nto the ends of a secondary coil. A spark passed between the charcoal\r\npoints when the primary circuit was closed. This was the first\r\ntransformer producing a tiny electric light (Fig. 34).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 34--THE FIRST TRANSFORMER]\r\n\r\nFaraday discovered the induction-coil, the dynamo, and the transformer,\r\nand he showed that, in each of these, it is magnetism which produces the\r\nelectric current. He had discovered the secret when he obtained a\r\ncurrent by thrusting a magnet into a coil of wire. The space about a\r\nmagnet in which the magnet will attract iron he called the \"magnetic\r\nfield\" (Figs. 35 and 36). In every case of magnetism causing an electric\r\ncurrent to flow in a coil of wire, the coil is in a magnetic field, and\r\nthe magnetic field is changing--that is, the magnetic field is made\r\nalternately stronger and weaker, or the coil moves across the magnetic\r\nfield. The point is that magnetism at rest will not produce an electric\r\ncurrent. There must be a changing magnetic field or motion. In Faraday's\r\ndynamo a copper disk whirled between the poles of a magnet and the\r\nwhirling of the disk in the magnetic field caused an electric current.\r\nIn the modern dynamo it is the whirling of a coil of wire in a magnetic\r\nfield that causes a current to flow. In the induction-coil it is the\r\nchange in the magnetic field that causes a current to flow in the\r\nsecondary coil. A coil of wire with an electric current flowing through\r\nit will attract iron like a magnet. The primary coil with a current from\r\na battery flowing through it acts in all respects like a magnet; but as\r\nsoon as the current ceases to flow the magnetic field disappears--the\r\ncoil is no longer a magnet. When we make and break the connection\r\nbetween the primary coil and the battery, then, we repeatedly make and\r\ndestroy the magnetic field, and this changing magnetic field causes a\r\ncurrent to flow in the secondary coil. The induction-coil is one form of\r\ntransformer. We shall see later how the dynamo and the transformer\r\ndeveloped in the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 35--THE \"MAGNETIC FIELD\" IS THE SPACE AROUND A\r\nMAGNET IN WHICH IT WILL ATTRACT IRON\r\n  The iron filings over the magnet arrange themselves along the \"lines of\r\nforce.\"]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 36--MAGNETIC FIELD OF A HORSESHOE MAGNET]\r\n\r\nWhen a boy, Faraday had passed the current from his little battery\r\nthrough a jar of cistern-water, and saw in the water a \"dense white\r\ncloud\" descending from the positive wire, and bubbles arising from the\r\nnegative wire. Something was being taken out of the water by the\r\nelectric current. When he tried the experiment later in his laboratory,\r\nhe found that, whenever an electric current is passed through water,\r\nbubbles of two gases, oxygen and hydrogen, rise through the water. He\r\nfound that if the current is made stronger the bubbles are formed\r\nfaster. The water in time disappears, for it has been changed or\r\n\"decomposed\" into the two gases.\r\n\r\nIt was the current from a battery that would decompose water. The\r\nelectricity from the electrical machine would do other things that he\r\nhad never seen a battery current do. \"Do the battery and the electrical\r\nmachine produce different kinds of electricity, or is electricity one\r\nand the same in whatever way it is produced?\" This was the query that\r\ntroubled him. The answer to this question had been so uncertain that the\r\neffect of the voltaic battery had been termed \"galvanism,\" while that of\r\nthe friction machine retained the name \"electricity.\"\r\n\r\nFaraday tried many experiments in searching for an answer to this\r\nquestion. He found that the electricity of the machine will produce the\r\nsame effect as that of a battery if the machine is compelled to\r\ndischarge slowly. An electrical machine or a battery of Leyden jars can\r\nbe made to give out an electric current, and this current will affect a\r\nmagnetic needle in the same way that a battery current will. It will\r\nmagnetize steel. If passed through water, it will decompose the water\r\ninto the two gases oxygen and hydrogen. In short, a current from an\r\nelectrical machine or a Leyden jar will do everything that a current\r\nfrom an electric battery will do. Faraday caused the Leyden jar to give\r\na current instead of a spark by connecting the two metal coatings with a\r\nwet string. On the other hand, the discharge from a powerful electric\r\nbattery will produce a spark and affect the human nerves in the same way\r\nas the discharge from the electrical machine. The same effects may be\r\nobtained from one as from the other.\r\n\r\nIn the discharge from the machine, a small quantity of electricity is\r\ndischarged under high pressure, as water may be forced through a small\r\nopening by very high pressure. The voltaic cell, on the other hand,\r\nfurnishes a large quantity of electricity at low pressure, as a street\r\nmay be flooded by a broken water-main though the pressure is low. In\r\nfact, the quantity of electricity required to decompose a grain of water\r\nis equal to that discharged in a stroke of lightning, while the action\r\nof a dilute acid on the one-hundredth part of an ounce of zinc in a\r\nbattery yields electricity sufficient for a powerful thunder-storm.\r\n\r\nMany tests were made, and the result was a convincing proof that\r\nelectricity is the same whatever its source, the different effects being\r\ndue to difference in pressure and quantity. \"But in no case,\" said\r\nFaraday, \"not even in those of the electric eel and torpedo, is there a\r\nproduction of electric power without something being used up to supply\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nFaraday's professional work would have made him wealthy. In one year he\r\nmade £1000 ($5000), and the amount would have increased had he sold his\r\nservices at their market value. But then there would have been no\r\nFaraday the discoverer. The world would have had to wait, no one knows\r\nhow long, for the laying of the foundations of electrical industries. He\r\nchose to give up wealth for the sake of discovery. He gave up\r\nprofessional work with the exception of scientific adviser to Trinity\r\nHouse, the body which has charge of Great Britain's lighthouse service.\r\nNor did he carry his discoveries to the point of practical application.\r\nAs soon as he discovered one principle, he set out in pursuit of others,\r\nleaving the practical application to the future.\r\n\r\nFaraday loved the beauty of nature. The sunset he called the scenery of\r\nheaven. He saw the beauty of electricity, which he said lies not in its\r\nmystery, but in the fact that it is under law and within the control of\r\nthe human intellect.\r\n\r\n    A Wonderful Law of Nature\r\n\r\nNot long after Faraday made his first dynamo, Robert Mayer, a physician\r\nfrom Germany, was making a voyage to the East Indies which proved to be\r\na voyage of discovery. He had sailed as the ship's physician, and after\r\nsome months an epidemic broke out among the ship's company. In his\r\ntreatment he drew blood from the veins of the arms. He was startled to\r\nsee bright-red blood issue from the veins. He might almost have believed\r\nthat he had opened an artery by mistake. It was soon explained to him by\r\na physician who had lived long in the tropics that the blood in the\r\nveins of the natives, and of foreigners as well, in the tropics is of\r\nnearly the same color as arterial blood. In colder climates the venous\r\nblood is much darker than the arterial.\r\n\r\nHe reasoned upon this curious fact for some time, and came to the\r\nconclusion that the human body does not make heat out of nothing, but\r\nconsumes fuel. The fuel is consumed in the blood, and there the heat is\r\nproduced. In the tropics less heat is needed, less fuel is consumed, and\r\ntherefore there is less change in the color of the blood.\r\n\r\nWhen a man works he uses up fuel. If a blacksmith heats a piece of iron\r\nby hammering, the heat given to the iron and the heat produced in his\r\nbody are together equal to the heat of the fuel consumed in his blood.\r\nThe work a man does, as well as the heat of his body, comes from the\r\nburning of the fuel in his blood.\r\n\r\nWhat is true of a man is true of an engine. The work the engine does, as\r\nwell as the heat it produces, comes from the heat of the fuel in the\r\nfurnace. Mayer found that one hundred pounds of coal in a good working\r\nengine produces the same amount of heat as ninety-five pounds in an\r\nengine that is not working. In the working engine the heat of the five\r\npounds of coal is used up in the work of running the engine, and\r\ntherefore does not heat the engine. Heat that is used in running the\r\nengine is no longer heat, but work. So Mayer said the heat is not\r\ndestroyed, but only changed into work. He said, further, that the work\r\nof running the engine may be changed again into heat.\r\n\r\nMayer's theory was opposed by many scientific men of Europe. One great\r\nscientist said to him that if his theory were correct water could be\r\nwarmed by shaking. He remembered what the helmsman had remarked to him\r\non the voyage to Java, that water beaten about by a storm is warmer than\r\nquiet sea-water; but he said nothing. He went to his laboratory, tried\r\nthe experiment, and some weeks later returned, exclaiming: \"It is so! It\r\nis so!\" He had warmed water simply by shaking it.\r\n\r\nThese results mean that work or energy cannot be destroyed. Though it\r\nchanges form in many ways, it is never destroyed. Neither can man create\r\nenergy; he can only direct its changes as the engineer, by the motion of\r\nhis finger in opening a valve, sets the locomotive in motion. He does\r\nnot move the locomotive. He directs the energy already in the steam.\r\n\r\nSince the time of Galileo, men had caught now and then a glimpse of this\r\ngreat law. Galileo had stated his law of machines; that, when a machine\r\ndoes work, a man or a horse or some other power does an equal amount of\r\nwork upon the machine. Count Rumford had performed his experiment with\r\nthe cannon, showing that heat is produced by the work of a horse. Davy\r\nhad proved that, in the voltaic battery, something must be used up to\r\nproduce the current--the mere contact of the metals is not sufficient.\r\nFaraday had said that in no case is there a production of electrical\r\npower without something being used up to supply it. Mayer stated clearly\r\nthis law of energy when he said that energy cannot be created or\r\ndestroyed, but only changed from one form to another.\r\n\r\nAnd yet inventors have not learned the meaning of this law. They\r\ncontinue trying to invent perpetual-motion machines--machines that will\r\nproduce work from nothing. This is what a perpetual-motion machine would\r\nbe if such a machine were possible. For a machine without friction is\r\nimpossible, and friction means wasted work--work changed into heat. A\r\nmachine to keep itself running and supply the work wasted in friction\r\nmust produce work from nothing. The great law of nature is that you\r\ncannot get something for nothing. Whether you get work, heat,\r\nelectricity, or light, something must be used up to produce it. For\r\nwhatever you get out of a machine you must give an equivalent. This law\r\ncannot be evaded, and from it there is no appeal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter V\r\n\r\nGREAT INVENTIONS OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe discoveries of Faraday prepared the way for the great inventions of\r\nthe nineteenth century. By the middle of the century men knew how to\r\ncontrol the wonderful power of electricity. They did not know what\r\nelectricity is, nor do we know to-day, though we have made some progress\r\nin that direction; but to control it and make it furnish light, heat,\r\nand power was more important.\r\n\r\nBefore the inventions of James Watt made it possible to use steam-power,\r\nfactories were built near falling water, so that water-power could be\r\nused. But the steam-engine made it possible to build great factories\r\nwherever a supply of water for the boilers could be obtained. Cities\r\nwere built around the factories. Cities already great became greater.\r\nWith the growth of cities the need of a new means of producing light and\r\npower made itself felt. Electricity promised to become the Hercules that\r\nshould perform the tasks of the modern world.\r\n\r\nDiscovery gave way to invention. During the second half of the\r\nnineteenth century many great inventions were made and industries were\r\ndeveloped, while discoveries were few until near the close of the\r\ncentury. Within this period the great industries which characterize our\r\nmodern civilization, and which arose out of the discoveries that science\r\nhad made in the centuries preceding, attained a high degree of\r\ndevelopment. In this chapter we shall trace the applications of some of\r\nthe discoveries with which we have now become familiar. This will lead\r\nus into the field of electrical invention, for we are dealing now with\r\nthe beginning of the world's electrical age.\r\n\r\n    Electric Batteries\r\n\r\nFrom the time of Volta to the time of Faraday the only means of\r\nproducing an electric current was the \"voltaic battery,\" so called in\r\nhonor of Volta. The voltaic cell is the simplest form of electric\r\nbattery. In this cell the zinc and copper plates are placed in sulphuric\r\nacid diluted with water. As the acid eats the zinc, hydrogen gas is\r\nformed. This gas collects in bubbles on the copper plate and weakens the\r\ncurrent. The aim of inventors was to produce a steady current, to devise\r\na battery in which no gas would collect on the copper plate. They saw\r\nthe need of a battery that would give out a current of unchanging\r\nstrength until the zinc or the acid was used up.\r\n\r\nThe first real improvement in the battery was made by Professor Daniell,\r\nof King's College, London. In the Daniell cell the zinc plate is in\r\ndilute sulphuric acid, and the copper plate is in a solution of blue\r\nvitriol or copper sulphate. Professor Daniell separated the two liquids\r\nby placing one of them in a tube formed of the gullet of an ox. This\r\ntube dipped into the other liquid. The hydrogen gas, as it was formed\r\nby the acid acting on the zinc, could go through the walls of the tube,\r\nbut was stopped by the copper sulphate, and copper was deposited on the\r\ncopper plate. This copper deposit in no way interfered with the current,\r\nso that the current was not weakened until the zinc plate or one of the\r\nsolutions was nearly consumed. A cup of porous earthenware is now used\r\nin Daniell cells to separate the liquids (Fig. 37). By placing crystals\r\nof blue vitriol in the battery jar, the solution of blue vitriol can be\r\nkept up to its full strength for a very long time. The zinc in time is\r\nconsumed, and must be replaced.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 37--A DANIELL CELL]\r\n\r\nIn the gravity cell (Fig. 38) the same materials are used as in the\r\nDaniell cell--copper in copper sulphate, and zinc in sulphuric acid; but\r\nthere is no porous cup. The solutions are kept separate by gravity, the\r\nheavy copper sulphate being at the bottom. The gravity cell has until\r\nrecently been extensively used in telegraphy, and continues in use in\r\nshort-distance telegraphy and in automatic block signals. The gravity\r\nand Daniell cells are used for closed-circuit work--that is, for work in\r\nwhich the current is flowing almost constantly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 38--A GRAVITY CELL]\r\n\r\n    The Dry Battery\r\n\r\nAnother important improvement was the invention of the dry battery. You\r\nwill remember that the first battery, the one invented by Volta, was a\r\nform of dry battery; but it was a very feeble battery compared with the\r\ndry batteries now in use, so that we may call the dry battery a new\r\ninvention. The dry battery is falsely named. There can be no battery\r\nwithout a liquid. In the dry battery the zinc cup forming the outside of\r\nthe cell is one of the plates of the cell (Fig. 39). The battery appears\r\nto be dry because the solution of sal ammoniac is absorbed by\r\nblotting-paper or other porous substance in contact with the zinc. The\r\ninner plate is carbon, and this is surrounded by powdered carbon and\r\nmanganese dioxide--the latter to remove the hydrogen gas which collects\r\non the carbon plate. This gas weakens the current when the circuit has\r\nbeen closed for a short time, but is slowly removed when the circuit is\r\nbroken. Thus the battery is said to \"recover.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 39--SHOWING WHAT IS IN A DRY BATTERY]\r\n\r\nThe dry cell will give a strong current, but for a short time only. It\r\nrecovers, however, if allowed to rest. It can be used, therefore, only\r\nin \"open-circuit\" work--such as door-bell circuits, and some forms of\r\nfire and burglar alarm. A door-bell circuit is open nearly all the time,\r\nthe current flowing only while the button is being pressed. Some forms\r\nof wet battery work in the same way as the dry battery, and are used\r\nlike-wise for open-circuit work. In these batteries carbon and zinc\r\nplates in a solution of sal ammoniac are used, the same materials as in\r\nthe dry battery. The only difference is that in the dry battery the\r\nsolution is absorbed by some porous substance and the battery sealed so\r\nthat it appears to be dry.\r\n\r\n    The Storage Battery\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest improvements in electric batteries is the storage\r\nbattery. A simple storage battery may be made by placing two strips of\r\nlead in sulphuric acid diluted with water and connecting the lead strips\r\nto a battery of Daniell cells or dry cells. In a short time one of the\r\nlead strips will be found covered with a red coating. The surface of\r\nthis lead strip is no longer lead but an oxide of lead, somewhat like\r\nthe rust that forms on iron. If the lead strips are now disconnected\r\nfrom the other battery and connected to an electric bell, the bell will\r\nring. We have here two plates, one of lead and one of oxide of lead, in\r\ndilute sulphuric acid. This forms a storage battery.\r\n\r\nThe first storage battery was made of two sheets of lead rolled together\r\nand kept apart by a strip of flannel. The lead strips thus separated\r\nwere immersed in dilute sulphuric acid. A current from another battery\r\nwas passed through this cell for a long time--first in one direction,\r\nthen in the other. This roughened the surface of the lead plates, so\r\nthat the battery would hold a greater charge. The battery was then\r\ncharged by passing a current through it in one direction only for a\r\nconsiderable length of time. Feeble cells were used for charging. It\r\ntook days, and sometimes weeks, to charge the first storage batteries.\r\nThen the storage battery would give out a strong current lasting for a\r\nfew hours. It slowly accumulated energy while being charged, and then\r\ngave out this energy rapidly in the form of a strong electric current.\r\nFor this reason the storage battery was called an \"accumulator.\"\r\n\r\nWhile charging the storage cell there was formed on the negative plate a\r\ncoating of soft lead, and on the positive plate a coating of dark-brown\r\noxide of lead. It was found better to apply these coatings to the lead\r\nplates before making up the battery. Later it was found that the battery\r\nwould hold a still greater charge if the plates were made in the form of\r\n\"grids\" (Fig. 40), and the cavities filled with the active material--the\r\nnegative with spongy lead, and the positive with dark-brown lead oxide.\r\nSome excellent commercial storage batteries are made from lead plates by\r\nthe action of an electric current, very much as Planté made his\r\nbatteries. Fig. 41 shows one of these plates.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 40--A STORAGE BATTERY, SHOWING THE \"GRIDS\"]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 41--A STORAGE-BATTERY PLATE MADE FROM A SHEET OF\r\nLEAD]\r\n\r\nThe storage battery does not store up electricity. It produces a current\r\nin exactly the same way as any other battery--by the action of the acid\r\non the plates. When this action ceases it is no longer a battery, though\r\nit may be made one again by passing a current through it in the opposite\r\ndirection from that which it gives out. In this it differs from the\r\nvoltaic battery, for when such a battery is run down it can be restored\r\nonly by adding new solution or new plates. The storage battery is\r\nespecially useful for \"sparking\" in gas or gasolene motors.\r\n\r\nEdison has invented a storage battery that will do as much work as a\r\nlead battery of twice its weight. Edison's battery is intended\r\nespecially for use in electric automobiles. By reducing the weight of\r\nthe battery which the machine must carry the weight of the truck may\r\nalso be reduced. In the Edison battery the positive plates are made of a\r\ngrid of nickel-plated steel containing tubes filled with pure nickel.\r\nThe negative plate consists of a nickel-plated steel grid containing an\r\noxide of iron similar to common iron-rust.\r\n\r\nAfter working a number of years on this battery and making nine thousand\r\nexperiments, Edison thought he had it perfected, and indeed it was a\r\ngreat improvement over the storage batteries that had been used--much\r\nlighter and cheaper, and more successful in operation. Two hundred and\r\nfifty automobiles were equipped with it, and it proved superior to lead\r\nbatteries for this purpose. But it was not to Edison's liking. He threw\r\nthe machinery, worth thousands of dollars, on the scrap-heap, and worked\r\non for six years. He had then produced a battery as much better than the\r\nfirst as the first was better than the lead battery, and he was content\r\nto have the new battery placed on the market.\r\n\r\n    The Dynamo\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of lighting and power the electric battery proved too\r\ncostly. Davy produced an arc light with a battery of four thousand\r\ncells. The arc was about four inches in length and yielded a brilliant\r\nlight, but as the cost was six dollars a minute it was not thought\r\npractical. Attempts were made early in the century to use a battery\r\ncurrent for power, but they failed because of the cost and the fact that\r\nno good working motor had been invented.\r\n\r\nLight and power were needed. Electricity could supply both. But how\r\novercome the difficulty of cost, and produce an electric current from\r\nburning coal or falling water? For answer man looked to the great\r\ndiscovery of Faraday and his \"new electrical machine.\" Inventors in\r\nGermany, France, England, Italy, and America made improvements until\r\nfrom the disk dynamo of Faraday there had evolved the modern dynamo.\r\n\r\nElectroplating and the telegraph are the only applications of the\r\nelectric current that became factors in the world's industry before the\r\ndynamo, yet in long-distance telegraphy and in electroplating to-day the\r\ndynamo is used. Without the dynamo, electric lighting, electric power,\r\nand electric traction as developed in the nineteenth century would have\r\nbeen impossible; in fact, the dynamo with the electric motor (which, as\r\nwe shall see, is only a dynamo reversed) is master of the field.\r\n\r\nThe way had been prepared for the application of Faraday's discovery by\r\nWilliam Sturgeon, an Englishman, and Joseph Henry, an American. Sturgeon\r\ndiscovered that soft iron is more quickly magnetized than steel, and\r\nfound that the strength of an electromagnet can be greatly increased by\r\nmaking the core of a soft-iron rod and bending the rod into the form of\r\na horseshoe (Fig. 42). The iron rod was coated with sealing-wax and\r\nwound with a single layer of copper wire, the turns of wire not\r\ntouching. This was in 1825, before Faraday discovered the principle of\r\nthe dynamo.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 42--STURGEON'S ELECTROMAGNET]\r\n\r\nProfessor Henry still further increased the strength of the\r\nelectromagnet by covering the wire with silk, which made it possible to\r\nwind several layers of wire on the iron core, and many times the length\r\nof wire that had been used by Sturgeon. Fig. 43 shows such a magnet. One\r\nof Henry's magnets weighed fifty-nine and a half pounds, and would hold\r\nup a ton of iron. Sturgeon said: \"Professor Henry has produced a\r\nmagnetic force which completely eclipses every other in the whole annals\r\nof magnetism.\" With Professor Henry's invention the electromagnet was\r\nready for use in the dynamo. Fig. 44 shows a strong electromagnet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 43--AN ELECTROMAGNET WITH MANY TURNS OF INSULATED\r\nWIRE]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 44--AN ELECTROMAGNET LIFTING TWELVE TONS OF IRON]\r\n\r\nA moving magnet causes a current to flow in a coil, but a magnet at rest\r\nhas no effect. A moving magnet is equal to a battery. In Faraday's\r\nexperiments a current was induced in a coil of wire by moving a magnet\r\nin the coil or by making and breaking the circuit in another coil wound\r\non the same iron core. A current was induced in a metal disk by\r\nrevolving it between the poles of a magnet. In every case there was\r\nmotion in a magnetic field, or the field itself was changed. A changing\r\nmagnetic field is equal to a moving magnet. What is needed to induce a\r\ncurrent in a coil, whether it be in a dynamo, an induction-coil, or a\r\ntransformer, is a changing magnetic field about the coil or motion of\r\nthe coil in the magnetic field.\r\n\r\nIf fine iron filings are sprinkled over the poles of a magnet the\r\nfilings arrange themselves in definite lines. This is a simple\r\nexperiment which any boy can try for himself. Faraday called the lines\r\nmarked out by the iron filings \"lines of force\" (the lines of force of a\r\nhorseshoe magnet are shown in Fig. 36), because they indicate the\r\ndirection in which the magnet pulls a piece of iron--that is, the\r\ndirection of the magnetic force. Now, if a current is to be induced in\r\na wire, the wire must move across the lines of force. If the wire moves\r\nalong the lines marked out by the iron filings, there will be no\r\ncurrent. When a coil rotates between the poles of a magnet, the wire\r\nmoves across the lines of force and a current is induced in the coil if\r\nthe circuit is closed. This is the way a current is produced in a\r\ndynamo.\r\n\r\nFaraday produced a current by rotating a coil between the poles of a\r\nsteel magnet. He made a number of such machines, and used them with some\r\nsuccess in producing lights for lighthouses, but the defects of these\r\nmachines were so great that the lighting of a city or the development of\r\npower on a large scale was impractical. The electromagnet was needed to\r\nsolve the problem.\r\n\r\n    Siemens' Dynamo\r\n\r\nThe war of 1866 between Austria and Prussia and the certainty of a\r\ncoming struggle with France turned the attention of German inventors to\r\nthe use of electricity in warfare. Werner von Siemens, an artillery\r\nofficer, was improving an exploding device for mines. An electric\r\ncurrent was needed to produce a spark or heat a wire to redness in the\r\npowder. Faraday had used a coil of wire turning between the poles of a\r\nsteel magnet to produce a current. In England a coil turning between the\r\npoles of an electromagnet had been used, but the electromagnet received\r\nits current from another machine in which a steel magnet was used.\r\nSiemens found that the steel magnet could be dispensed with, and that a\r\ncoil turning between the poles of an electromagnet could furnish the\r\ncurrent for the electromagnet. Two things are needed, then, to make a\r\ndynamo: an electromagnet and a coil to turn between the poles of that\r\nmagnet. The rotating coil, which usually contains a soft-iron core, is\r\ncalled the \"armature.\" The coil will furnish current for the magnet and\r\nsome to spare; in fact, only a small part of the current induced in the\r\ncoil is needed to keep the magnet up to its full strength, and the\r\ngreater part of the current may be used for lighting or power. The new\r\nmachine was named by its inventor \"the dynamo-electric machine.\" The\r\nname has since been shortened to \"dynamo.\" The first practical problem\r\nwhich the dynamo solved was the construction of an electric exploding\r\napparatus without the use of steel magnets or batteries. A dynamo with\r\nSiemens' armature is shown in Fig. 45.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 45--A DYNAMO WITH SIEMENS' ARMATURE]\r\n\r\nIn his first enthusiasm the inventor dreamed of great things for the new\r\nmachine, among others an electric street railway in Berlin. But the\r\ndynamo was not yet ready. The difficulty was the heating of the iron\r\ncore of the armature, caused by the action of induced currents. There\r\nare induced currents in the iron core as well as in the coil, and, for\r\nthe same reason, the coil and the iron core within it are both moving in\r\na magnetic field. These little currents circling round and round in the\r\niron core produce heat. The rapid changing of the magnetism of the iron\r\nalso heats the iron.\r\n\r\nIt remained for Gramme, in France, to apply the proper remedy. This\r\nremedy was an armature in which the coil was wound on an iron ring,\r\ninvented by an Italian, Pacinotti. Gramme applied the principle\r\ndiscovered by Siemens to Pacinotti's ring, and produced the first\r\npractical dynamo for strong currents. This was in 1868. A ring armature\r\nis shown in Fig. 46. The first dynamo patented in the United States is\r\nshown in Fig. 47. This dynamo is only a curiosity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 46--RING ARMATURE]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 47--FIRST DYNAMO PATENTED IN THE UNITED STATES\r\n  Intended to be used for killing whales.\r\n  Photo by Claudy.]\r\n\r\n    The Drum Armature\r\n\r\nAn improvement in the Siemens armature was made four years later by Von\r\nHefner-Alteneck, an engineer in the employ of Siemens. This improvement\r\nconsisted in winding on the iron core a number of coils similar to the\r\none coil of the Siemens armature, but wound in different directions.\r\nThis is called the \"drum armature\" (Fig. 48). The heating of the core is\r\nprevented by building it up of a number of thin iron plates insulated\r\nfrom one another and by air-spaces within the core. The insulation\r\nprevents the small currents from flowing around in the core. The\r\nair-spaces serve for cooling. The drum armature was a great improvement\r\nover both the Siemens and the Gramme armatures. With the Siemens\r\none-coil armature there is a point in each revolution at which there is\r\nno current. The current, therefore, varies during each revolution of the\r\narmature from zero to full strength. In the Gramme armature only half\r\nthe wire, the part on the outside of the ring, receives the full effect\r\nof the magnetic field. The inner half is practically useless, except to\r\ncarry the current which is generated in the outer half. Both these\r\ndifficulties are avoided in the drum armature. The dynamos of to-day are\r\nmodifications of the two kinds invented by Siemens and Gramme. Many\r\nspecial forms have been designed for special kinds of work.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 48--A DRUM ARMATURE, SHOWING HOW AN ARMATURE OF FOUR\r\nCOILS IS WOUND]\r\n\r\n    Edison's Compound-Wound Dynamo\r\n\r\nEdison, in his work on the electric light and the electric railway, made\r\nsome important improvements in the dynamo. The armature of a dynamo is\r\nusually turned by a steam-engine. Edison found that much power was\r\nwasted in the use of belts to connect the engine and the dynamo. He\r\ntherefore connected the engine direct to the dynamo, placing the\r\narmature of the dynamo on the shaft of the engine. He also used more\r\npowerful field-magnets than had been used before. His greatest\r\nimprovement, however, was in making the dynamo self-regulating, so that\r\nthe dynamo will send out the strength of current that is needed. Such a\r\ndynamo will send out more current when more lights are turned on.\r\nWhether it supplies current for one light or a thousand, it sends out\r\njust the current that is needed--no more, no less. It will do this if no\r\nhuman being is near. An attendant is needed only to keep the machinery\r\nwell oiled and see that each part is in working order. Edison brought\r\nabout this improvement by his improved method of winding. This method is\r\nknown as \"compound winding.\"\r\n\r\nTo understand compound winding we must first understand two other\r\nmethods of winding. In the series winding (Fig. 49), all the current\r\ngenerated in the armature flows through the coils of the field-magnet.\r\nThere is only one circuit. The same current flows through the coils of\r\nthe magnet and through the outer circuit, which may contain lights or\r\nmotors. Such a dynamo is commonly used for arc lights. It will not\r\nregulate itself. If left to itself it will give less electrical pressure\r\nwhen more pressure is needed. It requires a special regulator.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 49--A SERIES-WOUND DYNAMO]\r\n\r\nIn the second form of winding the current is divided into two branches.\r\nOne branch goes through the coils of the field-magnet. The other branch\r\ngoes through the line wire for use in lights or motors. This is called\r\nthe \"shunt winding\" (Fig. 50). The shunt-wound dynamo is used for\r\nincandescent lights. It also requires a special regulator, for if left\r\nto itself it gives less electrical pressure when the pressure should be\r\nkept the same.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 50--A SHUNT-WOUND DYNAMO]\r\n\r\nThe compound winding (Fig. 51), which was first used by Edison, is a\r\ncombination of the series and shunt windings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 51--A COMPOUND-WOUND DYNAMO]\r\n\r\nThe current is divided into two branches. One branch goes only through\r\nthe field-coils. The other branch goes through additional coils which\r\nare wound on the field-magnet, and also through the external circuit.\r\nSuch a dynamo can be made self-regulating, so that it will give always\r\nthe same electrical pressure whatever the number of lamps or motors\r\nthrown into the circuit. In maintaining always the same pressure it of\r\ncourse supplies more or less current, according to the amount of current\r\nthat is needed. This is clear if we compare the flow of electric current\r\nwith the flow of water. Open a water-faucet and notice how fast the\r\nwater flows. Then open several other faucets connected with the same\r\nwater-pipe. Probably the water will not flow so fast from the first\r\nfaucet. That is because the pressure has been lowered by the flow of\r\nwater from the other faucets. If we could make the water adjust its own\r\npressure and keep the pressure always the same, then the water would\r\nalways flow at the same rate through a faucet, no matter how many\r\nother faucets were opened. This is what happens in the Edison\r\ncompound-wound dynamo. Turn on one 16-candle-power carbon lamp. It takes\r\nabout half an ampere of current. Turn on a hundred lamps connected to\r\nthe same wires, and the dynamo of its own accord keeps the pressure the\r\nsame, and supplies fifty amperes, or half an ampere for each lamp. With\r\nthis invention of Edison the dynamo was practically complete, and ready\r\nto furnish current for any purpose for which current might be needed.\r\nFig. 52 shows one of Edison's first dynamos. Fig. 53 shows a dynamo used\r\nfor lighting a railway coach.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 52--ONE OF EDISON'S FIRST DYNAMOS\r\n  Permission of Association of Edison Illuminating Companies.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 53--A DYNAMO MOUNTED ON THE TRUCK OF A RAILWAY CAR\r\n  The dynamo furnishes current for the electric lights in the car. When\r\nthe train is not running the current is furnished by a storage\r\nbattery.]\r\n\r\n    Electric Power\r\n\r\nIt has been said that the nineteenth century was the age of steam, but\r\nthe twentieth will be the age of electricity. Before the end of the\r\nnineteenth century, however, electric power had become a reality, and\r\nthere remained only development along practical lines.\r\n\r\nWe must turn to Oersted, Ampère, and Faraday to find the beginning of\r\nelectric power. In Oersted's experiment, motion of a magnet was produced\r\nby an electric current. Ampère found that electric currents attract or\r\nrepel each other, and this because of their magnetic action. Faraday\r\nfound that one pole of a magnet will spin round a wire through which a\r\ncurrent is flowing. Here was motion produced by an electric current.\r\nThese great scientists discovered the principles that were applied later\r\nby inventors in the electric motor.\r\n\r\nA number of motors were invented in the early years of the century, but\r\nthey were of no practical use. It was not until after the invention of\r\nthe Gramme and Siemens dynamos that a practical motor was possible. It\r\nwas found that one of these dynamos would run as a motor if a current\r\nwere sent through the coils of the armature and the field-magnet; in\r\nfact, the current from one dynamo may be made to run another similar\r\nmachine as a motor. Thus the dynamo is said to be reversible. If the\r\narmature is turned by a steam-engine or some other power, a current is\r\nproduced. If a current is sent through the coils, the armature turns and\r\ndoes work. If the machine is used to supply an electric current, it is a\r\ndynamo. If used to do work--as, for example, to propel a street-car and\r\nfor that purpose receives a current--it is a motor. The same machine may\r\nbe used for either purpose. In practice there are some differences in\r\nthe winding of the coils of dynamos and motors, yet any dynamo can be\r\nused as a motor and any motor can be used as a dynamo. This discovery\r\nmade it possible to transmit power to a distance with little waste as\r\nwell as to divide the power easily. The current from one large dynamo\r\nmay light streets and houses, and at the same time run a number of\r\nmotors in factories or street-cars at great distances apart. A\r\ncentral-station dynamo may run the motors that propel hundreds of\r\nstreet-cars. Dynamos at Niagara furnish current for motors in Buffalo\r\nand other cities. One great scientist, who no doubt fore-saw the wonders\r\nof electricity which we know so well to-day, said that the greatest\r\ndiscovery of the nineteenth century was that the Gramme machine is\r\nreversible.\r\n\r\n    The First Electric Railway\r\n\r\nThe electric railway was made possible by the invention of the dynamo\r\nand the discovery that the dynamo is reversible. At the Industrial\r\nExposition in Berlin in 1879 there was exhibited the first practical\r\nelectric locomotive, the invention of Doctor Siemens. The locomotive and\r\nits passenger-coach were absurdly small. The track was circular, and\r\nabout one thousand feet in length. This diminutive railway was referred\r\nto by an American magazine as \"Siemens' electrical merry-go-round.\" But\r\nthe electrical merry-go-round aroused great interest because of the\r\npossibilities it represented (Fig. 54).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 54--FIRST ELECTRIC LOCOMOTIVE]\r\n\r\nThe current was generated by a dynamo in Machinery Hall, this dynamo\r\nbeing run by a steam-engine. An exactly similar dynamo mounted on wheels\r\nformed the locomotive. The current from the dynamo in Machinery Hall was\r\nused to run the other as a motor and so propel the car. The rails served\r\nto conduct the current. A third rail in the middle of the track was\r\nconnected to one pole of the dynamo and the two outer rails to the other\r\npole. A small trolley wheel made contact with the third rail. The rails\r\nwere not insulated, but it was found that the leakage current was very\r\nsmall, even when the ground was wet.\r\n\r\nThe success of this experiment aroused great interest, not only in\r\nGermany, but in Europe and America. America's greatest inventor, Edison,\r\ntook up the problem. Edison employed no trolley line or third rail, but\r\nonly the two rails of the track as conductors, sending the current out\r\nthrough one rail and back through the other. Of course, this meant that\r\nthe wheels must be insulated, so that the current could flow from one\r\nrail to the other only through the coils of the motor.\r\n\r\nAs in Siemens' experiment, the motor was of the same construction as the\r\ndynamo. The rails were not insulated, and it was found that, even when\r\nthe track was wet, the loss of electric current was not more than 5 per\r\ncent. Edison found that he could realize in his motor 70 per cent. of\r\nthe power applied to the dynamo, whereas the German inventor was able to\r\nrealize only 60 per cent. The improvement was largely due to the\r\nimproved winding. Edison was the first to use in practical work the\r\ncompound-wound dynamo, and this was done in connection with his electric\r\nrailway. Fig. 55 shows Edison's first electric locomotive.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 55--FIRST EDISON ELECTRIC LOCOMOTIVE]\r\n\r\nThe question of gearing was a troublesome one. The armature shaft of the\r\nmotor was at first connected by friction gearing to the axle of two\r\nwheels of the locomotive. Later a belt and pulleys were used. An idler\r\npulley was used to tighten the belt. When the motor was started and the\r\nbelt quickly tightened the armature was burned out. This happened a\r\nnumber of times. Then Mr. Edison brought out from the laboratory a\r\nnumber of resistance-boxes, placed them on the locomotive, and connected\r\nthem in series with the armature. These resistances would permit only a\r\nsmall current to flow through the motor as it was starting, and so\r\nprevent the burning-out of the armature coils. The locomotive was\r\nstarted with the resistance-boxes in circuit, and after gaining some\r\nspeed the operator would plug the various boxes out of circuit, and in\r\nthat way increase the speed. When the motor is running there is a\r\nback-pressure, or a pressure that would cause a current to flow in the\r\nopposite direction from that which is running the motor. Because of this\r\nback-pressure the current which actually flows through the motor is\r\nsmall, and the resistance-boxes may be safely taken out of the circuit.\r\nFinding the resistance-boxes scattered about under the seats and on the\r\nplatform as they were a nuisance, Mr. Edison threw them aside, and used\r\nsome coils of wire wound on the motor field-magnet which could be\r\nplugged out of the circuit in the same way as the resistance-boxes. This\r\ndevice of Edison's was the origin of the controller, though in the\r\ncontroller now used on street-cars not only is the resistance cut out as\r\nthe speed of the car increases, but the electrical connections of the\r\nmotor are changed in such a way as to increase its speed gradually.\r\nFig. 56 shows Edison's first passenger locomotive.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 56--EDISON'S FIRST PASSENGER LOCOMOTIVE]\r\n\r\nThe news of the little electric railway at the Industrial Exposition in\r\nBerlin was soon noised abroad, and the German inventor received\r\ninquiries from all parts of the world, indicating that efforts would be\r\nmade in other countries to develop practical electrical railways. The\r\nfirm of Siemens & Halske therefore determined to build a line for actual\r\ntraffic, not for profit, but that Germany might have the honor of\r\nbuilding the first practical electric railway. The line was built\r\nbetween Berlin and Lichterfelde, a distance of about one and a half\r\nmiles. A horse-car seating twenty-six persons was pressed into service.\r\nA motor was mounted between the axles, and a central-station dynamo\r\nexactly like the motor was installed. As in Edison's experimental\r\nrailway, the two rails of the track were used to carry the current. This\r\nelectric line replaced an omnibus line, and was immediately used for\r\nregular traffic, and thus the electric railway was launched upon its\r\nremarkable career. The first electric car used for commercial service is\r\nshown in Fig. 57.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 57--FIRST COMMERCIAL ELECTRIC RAILWAY\r\n  An old horse-car converted into an electric car.]\r\n\r\n    Electric Lighting\r\n\r\nFrom the time when the night-watchman carried a lantern to the time of\r\nbrilliantly lighted streets was less than a century. It was a time when\r\nthe rapid growth of railways and commerce brought about a rapid growth\r\nof cities, and with the growth of cities the need of illumination.\r\nFactories must run at night to meet the world's demands. Commerce cannot\r\nstop when the sun sets. The centres of commerce must have light.\r\n\r\nDuring this time scientists were at work in their laboratories\r\ndeveloping means for producing a high vacuum. They were able to pump the\r\nair out of a glass bulb until less than a millionth part of the air\r\nremained. They little dreamed that there was any connection between the\r\nhigh vacuum and the problem of lighting. Discoverers were at work\r\nbringing to light the principles now utilized in the dynamo. In the\r\nfulness of time these factors were brought together to produce an\r\nefficient system of lighting.\r\n\r\nFor a time gas replaced the lantern of the night-watchman, only to yield\r\nthe greater portion of the field to its rival, electricity.\r\n\r\nThe first efforts were in the direction of the arc light. From the\r\nearliest times the light given out by an electric spark had been\r\nobserved. It was the aim of inventors to produce a continuous spark that\r\nshould give out a brilliant light. It was thought for a time that the\r\nelectric battery would solve the problem, but the cost of the battery\r\ncurrent was too great. Again we are indebted to Faraday, for it was the\r\ndynamo that made electric lighting possible.\r\n\r\nAn arc light is produced by an electric current flowing across a gap\r\nbetween two sticks of carbon. The air offers very great resistance to\r\nthe flow of electric current across this gap. Now whenever an electric\r\ncurrent flows through something which resists its flow, heat is\r\nproduced. The high resistance of the air-gap causes such intense heat\r\nthat the tips of the carbons become white hot and give out a brilliant\r\nlight. If examined through a smoked glass a beautiful blue arc of carbon\r\nvapor may be seen between the carbon tips. If the current flows in one\r\ndirection only, one of the carbons, the positive, becomes hotter and\r\nbrighter than the other.\r\n\r\nIn 1878 the streets of Paris were lighted with the \"Jablochkoff candle,\"\r\na form of arc light supplied with current by the Gramme machine. In the\r\nsame year the Brush system of arc lighting was given to the public. This\r\nwas the beginning of our present system of arc lighting.\r\n\r\nThe electric arc is suitable for lighting streets and for large\r\nbuildings, but cannot be used for lighting houses. The light is too\r\nintense. One arc would furnish enough light for a number of houses if\r\nthe light could be divided so that there might be just the right amount\r\nof light in each room. But this is impossible with the electric arc.\r\nThe Edison system of incandescent lighting was required to solve the\r\nproblem of lighting houses by electricity.\r\n\r\nIn 1880 the Edison system was brought out for commercial use. Edison's\r\nproblem was to produce a light that could be divided into a number of\r\nsmall lights, and one that would require less attention than the arc\r\nlight. He tried passing a current through platinum wire enclosed in a\r\nvacuum. This gave a fairly good light, but was not wholly satisfactory.\r\nHe sat one night thinking about the problem, unconsciously fingering a\r\nbit of lampblack mixed with tar which he had used in his telephone. Not\r\nthinking what he was doing, he rolled this mixture of tar and lampblack\r\ninto a thread. Then he noticed what he had done, and the thought\r\noccurred to him: \"Why not pass an electric current through this thread\r\nof carbon?\" He tried it. A faint glow was the result. He felt that he\r\nwas on the right track. A piece of cotton thread must be heated in a\r\nfurnace in an iron mold, which would prevent the thread from burning by\r\nkeeping out the air. Then all the other elements that were in the thread\r\nwould be driven out and only the carbon remain. For three days he worked\r\nwithout sleep to prepare this carbon filament. At the end of two days he\r\nsucceeded in getting a perfect filament, but when he attempted to seal\r\nit in the glass bulb it broke. He patiently worked another day, and was\r\nrewarded by securing a good carbon filament, sealed in a glass globe. He\r\npumped the air out of this globe, sealed it, and sent a current through\r\nthe carbon thread. He tried a weak current at first. There was a faint\r\nglow. He increased the current. The thread glowed more brightly. He\r\ncontinued to increase the current until the slender thread of carbon,\r\nwhich would crumble at a touch, was carrying a current that would melt a\r\nwire of platinum strong enough to support a weight of several pounds.\r\nThe carbon gave a bright light. He had found a means of causing the\r\nelectric current to furnish a large number of small lights. Fig. 58 is\r\nan excellent photograph of Edison at work in his laboratory. Fig. 59\r\nshows some of Edison's first incandescent lamps. He next set out in\r\nsearch of the best kind of carbon for the purpose. He carbonized paper\r\nand wood of various kinds--in fact, everything he could find that would\r\nyield a carbon filament. He tried the fibres of a Japanese fan made of\r\nbamboo, and found that this gave a better light than anything he had\r\ntried before. He then began the search for the best kind of bamboo. He\r\nlearned that there are about twelve hundred varieties of bamboo. He must\r\nhave a sample of every variety. He sent men into every part of the world\r\nwhere bamboo grows. One man travelled thirty thousand miles and had many\r\nencounters with wild beasts in his search for the samples of bamboo. At\r\nlast a Japanese bamboo was found that was better than any other. The\r\nsearch for the carbon fibre had cost about a hundred thousand dollars.\r\nLater it was found that a \"squirted filament\" could be made that worked\r\nas well as the bamboo fibre. This was made by dissolving cotton wool in\r\na certain solution, and then squirting this solution through a small\r\nhole into a small tank containing alcohol. The alcohol causes the\r\nsubstance to set and harden, and thus forms a carbon thread the size of\r\nthe hole. Fig. 60 shows the first commercial electric-lighting plant,\r\nwhich was installed on the steamship _Columbia_ in 1880.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n  Copyright, 1904, by Byron, N. Y.\r\nFIG. 58--EDISON, AMERICA'S GREATEST INVENTOR, AT WORK IN HIS LABORATORY]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n  Copyright, 1904, by William J. Hammer\r\nFIG. 59--EDISON'S FAMOUS HORSESHOE PAPER-FILAMENT LAMP OF 1870]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 60--FIRST COMMERCIAL EDISON ELECTRIC-LIGHTING PLANT;\r\nINSTALLED ON THE STEAMSHIP \"COLUMBIA\" IN MAY, 1880]\r\n\r\nThe carbon thread in the incandescent light is heated to a white heat,\r\nand because it is so heated it gives out light. In air such a tiny\r\nthread of white-hot carbon would burn in a fraction of a second. The\r\ncarbon must be in a vacuum, and so the air is pumped out of the light\r\nbulb with a special kind of air-pump invented not long before Edison\r\nbegan his work on the electric light. This pump is capable of taking out\r\npractically all the air that was in the bulb. Perhaps a millionth part\r\nof the original air remains.\r\n\r\nA great invention is never completed by one man. It was to be expected\r\nthat the electric light would be improved. A number of kinds of\r\nincandescent light have been devised, using different kinds of filaments\r\nand adapted to a variety of uses. The original Edison carbon lamp,\r\nhowever, continues in use, being better adapted to certain purposes than\r\nthe newer forms.\r\n\r\nThe mercury vapor light deserves mention as a special form of arc light.\r\nIn the ordinary arc light the arc is formed of carbon vapor, and the\r\nlight is given out from the tips of the white-hot carbons. In the\r\nmercury vapor light the light is given out from the mercury vapor which\r\nforms the arc. This arc may be of any desired length, and yields a soft,\r\nbluish-white light which is a near approach to daylight.\r\n\r\n    The Telegraph\r\n\r\nThe need of some means of giving signals at a distance was early felt in\r\nthe art of war. Flag signals such as are now used by the armies and\r\nnavies of the world were introduced in the middle of the seventeenth\r\ncentury by the Duke of York, admiral of the English fleet, who afterward\r\nbecame James II. of England. Other methods of communicating at a\r\ndistance were devised from time to time, but the distance was only that\r\nat which a signal could be seen or a sound heard. No means of\r\ncommunicating over very long distances was possible until the magnetic\r\naction of an electric current was discovered. When Oersted's discovery\r\nwas made known men began to think of signalling to a distance by means\r\nof the action of an electric current on a magnetic needle. A current may\r\nbe sent over a very long wire, and it will deflect a magnetic needle at\r\nthe other end. The movements of the needle may be controlled by opening\r\nand closing the circuit, and a system of signals or an alphabet may be\r\narranged. A number of needle telegraphs were invented, but they were too\r\nslow in action. Two other great inventions were needed to prepare the\r\nway for the telegraph. One was the electromagnet in the form developed\r\nby Professor Henry, a horseshoe magnet with many turns of silk-covered\r\nwire around the soft-iron core, so that a very feeble current will\r\nproduce a magnet strong enough to move an armature of soft iron. The\r\nmagnet has this strength because the current flows so many times around\r\nthe iron core. Another need was that of a battery that could be depended\r\non to give a constant current for a considerable length of time. This\r\nneed was met by the Daniell cell.\r\n\r\nThe electromagnet made the telegraph possible. The locomotive made it a\r\nnecessity. Without the telegraph it would be impossible to control a\r\nrailway system from a central office. A train after leaving the central\r\nstation would be like a ship at sea before the invention of the wireless\r\ntelegraph. Nothing could be known of its movements until it returned.\r\nThe need of a telegraph was keenly felt in America when the new republic\r\nwas extended to the Pacific Coast. An English statesman said, after the\r\nUnited States acquired California, that this marked the end of the great\r\nAmerican Republic, for a people spread over such a vast area and\r\nseparated by such natural barriers could not hold together. He did not\r\nknow that the iron wire of the telegraph would bind the new nation\r\nfirmly together.\r\n\r\nThe Morse telegraph system now in use throughout the civilized world was\r\nmade possible by the work of Sturgeon and Henry. Sturgeon's\r\nelectromagnet might have been used for telegraphy through very short\r\ndistances, but Henry's magnet, with its coils of many turns of insulated\r\nwire, was needed for long-distance signalling. In one of the rooms of\r\nthe Albany Academy, Professor Henry caused an electromagnet to sound a\r\nbell when the current was transmitted through more than a mile of wire.\r\nThis might be called the first electromagnetic telegraph. But the\r\napplication to actual practice was made by Morse, and the man who first\r\nmakes the practical application of a principle is the true inventor.\r\n\r\nIn 1832, on board the packet-ship _Sully_, Samuel F. B. Morse, an\r\nAmerican artist, forty-one years of age, was returning from Europe. In\r\nconversation a Doctor Jackson referred to the electrical experiments of\r\nAmpère, which he had witnessed while in Europe, and, in reply to a\r\nquestion, said that electricity passes instantaneously over any known\r\nlength of wire. The thought of transmitting words by means of the\r\nelectric current at once took possession of the artist's mind. After\r\nmany days and sleepless nights he showed to friends on board the\r\ndrawings and notes he had made of a recording telegraph.\r\n\r\nIn New York, in a room provided by his brothers, he gave himself up to\r\nthe working-out of his idea, sleeping little and eating the simplest\r\nfood. Receiving an appointment as professor in the University of the\r\nCity of New York, he moved to one of the buildings of that university\r\nand continued his experiments in extreme poverty, and at times facing\r\nstarvation, as his salary depended on the tuition fees of his pupils.\r\n\r\nA story told by one of his pupils describes his condition at the time.\r\n\r\n\"I engaged to become one of Morse's pupils. He had three others. I soon\r\nfound that the professor had little patronage. I paid my fifty dollars;\r\nthat settled one quarter's tuition. I remember, when the second was due,\r\nmy remittance from home did not come as expected, and one day the\r\nprofessor came in and said, courteously:\r\n\r\n\"'Well, Strother, my boy, how are we off for money?'\r\n\r\n\"'Why, professor, I am sorry to say I have been disappointed; but I\r\nexpect a remittance next week.'\r\n\r\n\"'Next week!' he repeated, sadly; 'I shall be dead by that time.'\r\n\r\n\"'Dead, sir?'\r\n\r\n\"'Yes; dead by starvation!'\r\n\r\n\"I was distressed and astonished. I said, hurriedly: 'Would ten dollars\r\nbe of any service?'\r\n\r\n\"'Ten dollars would save my life; that is all it would do.'\"\r\n\r\nThe money was paid, all the student had, and the two dined together. It\r\nwas Morse's first meal in twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nThe Morse telegraph sounder (Fig. 61) consists of an electromagnet and a\r\nsoft-iron armature. When no current is flowing the armature is held away\r\nfrom the magnet by a spring. When the circuit is closed a current flows\r\nthrough the coils of the magnet and the armature is attracted, causing\r\na click. When the circuit is broken the spring pulls the armature away\r\nfrom the magnet, causing another click. The circuit is made and broken\r\nby means of a key at the other end of the line. In Morse's first\r\ninstrument (Fig. 62) the armature carried a pen, which was drawn across\r\na ribbon of paper when the armature was attracted by the magnet. If the\r\npen was held by the magnet for a very short time, a dot was made; if for\r\na longer time, a dash. The pen was soon discarded, and the message taken\r\nby sound only. The Morse alphabet now in use was devised by a Mr. Vail,\r\nwho assisted Morse in developing the telegraph. The thought occurred to\r\nMr. Vail that he could get help from a printing-office in deciding the\r\ncombinations of dots and dashes that should be used for the different\r\nletters. The letters requiring the largest spaces in the type-cases are\r\nthe ones that occur most frequently, and for these letters he used the\r\nsimplest combinations of dots and dashes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 61--A TELEGRAPH SOUNDER]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 62--MORSE'S FIRST TELEGRAPH INSTRUMENT\r\n  A pen was attached to the pendulum and drawn across the strip of paper\r\nby the action of the electromagnet. The lead type shown in the lower\r\nright-hand corner was used in making electrical contact when sending a\r\nmessage. The modern instrument shown in the lower left-hand corner is\r\nthe one that sent a message around the world in 1896.\r\n  Photo by Claudy.]\r\n\r\nMorse repeatedly said that, if he could make his telegraph work through\r\nten miles, he could make it work around the world. This promise of\r\nlong-distance telegraphy he fulfilled by the use of the relay. The relay\r\nworks in the same way as the sounder. The current coming over a long\r\nline may be too feeble to produce a click that can be easily heard, yet\r\nstrong enough to magnetize the coils of the relay and cause the armature\r\nto close another circuit. This second circuit includes the sounder and a\r\nbattery in the same station as the sounder, which we shall call \"the\r\nlocal battery.\" The relay simply acts as a contact key, and closes the\r\ncircuit of the local battery. Thus the current from the local battery\r\nflows through the sounder and produces a loud click. Sometimes a relay\r\nis used to control a second very long circuit. At the farther end of the\r\nsecond circuit may be a sounder or a second relay which controls a third\r\ncircuit. Any number of circuits may be thus connected by means of\r\nrelays. This is a form of repeating system used for telegraphing over\r\nvery long distances. Fig. 63 shows a circuit with relay and sounder.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 63--A TELEGRAPHIC CIRCUIT WITH RELAY AND SOUNDER]\r\n\r\nIn the telegraphic circuit only one connecting wire is needed. The\r\nearth, being a good conductor of electricity, is used as part of the\r\ncircuit. It is necessary, therefore, to make a ground connection at each\r\nend of the line, the instruments being connected between the line wire\r\nand the earth. For long-distance telegraphy a current from a dynamo is\r\nused instead of a battery current. Fig. 64 shows a simple telegraphic\r\ncircuit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 64--A SIMPLE TELEGRAPHIC CIRCUIT\r\n  Two keys are shown at _K K_, and two switches at _S S_. When one key\r\nis to be used the switch at that station must be open, and the switch at\r\nthe other station closed.]\r\n\r\nA telegraphic message travels with the speed of light, for the speed of\r\nelectricity and the speed of light are the same. A telegraphic signal\r\nwould go more than seven times around the earth in one second if it\r\ntravelled on one continuous wire. The relays that must be used, however,\r\ncause some delay.\r\n\r\nIn 1835 Morse's experimental telegraph was completed, and in 1837 it was\r\nexhibited to the public, but seven years more passed before a line was\r\nestablished for public use. Aid from Congress was necessary. Going to\r\nWashington, Morse exhibited his instrument in the halls of the Capitol,\r\nsending messages through ten miles of wire wound on a reel. The\r\ninvention was ridiculed, but the inventor did not despair. A bill for an\r\nappropriation to establish a telegraphic line between Washington and\r\nBaltimore passed the House by a small majority. The last day of the\r\nsession came. Ten o'clock at night, two hours before adjournment, and\r\nthe Senate had not acted. A senator advised Morse to go home and think\r\nno more of it, saying that the Senate was not in sympathy with his\r\nproject. He went to his hotel, counted his money, and found that he\r\ncould pay his bill, buy his ticket home, and have thirty-seven cents\r\nleft. All through his work he had firmly believed that a Higher Power\r\nwas directing his work, and bringing to the world, through his\r\ninvention, a new and uplifting force; and so when all seemed lost he did\r\nnot lose heart.\r\n\r\nIn the morning a friend, Miss Ellsworth, called and offered her\r\ncongratulations that the bill had been passed by the Senate and thirty\r\nthousand dollars appropriated for the telegraph. Being the first to\r\nbring the news of his success, Mr. Morse promised her that the first\r\nmessage over the new line should be hers. In about a year the line was\r\ncompleted, and Miss Ellsworth dictated the now famous message: \"What\r\nhath God wrought!\"\r\n\r\nSoon afterward the Democratic Convention, in session in Baltimore,\r\nreceived a telegraphic message from Senator Silas Wright, in Washington,\r\ndeclining the nomination for the Vice-Presidency, which had been\r\ntendered him. The convention refused to accept a message sent by\r\ntelegraph, and sent a committee to Washington to investigate. The\r\nmessage was confirmed, and Morse and his telegraph became famous. Fig.\r\n65 shows the first telegraph instrument used for commercial work.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 65--FIRST TELEGRAPH INSTRUMENT USED FOR COMMERCIAL\r\nWORK\r\n  Photo by Claudy.]\r\n\r\nThe desire to telegraph across the ocean came with the introduction of\r\nthe telegraph on land. Bare wires in the air with glass insulators at\r\nthe poles are used for land telegraphy, but bare wires in the water\r\ncould not be used, for ocean water will conduct electricity. Something\r\nwas needed to cover the wire, protect it from the water, and prevent the\r\nescape of the electric current. Just when it was needed such a\r\nsubstance was discovered. In 1843, when Morse was working on his\r\ntelegraph, it was found that the juice of a certain kind of tree growing\r\nin the Malayan Archipelago formed a substance somewhat like rubber but\r\nmore durable, and especially suited to the insulation of wires in water.\r\nThis substance is gutta-percha. Ocean cables are made of a number of\r\ncopper wires, each wire covered with gutta-percha, the wires twisted\r\ntogether and protected with tarred rope yarn and an outer layer of\r\ngalvanized iron wires. The earth is used for the return circuit, as in\r\nthe land telegraph.\r\n\r\n    Duplex Telegraphy\r\n\r\nThe telegraph was a success, but many improvements were yet to be made.\r\nEconomy of construction was the thing sought for. To make one wire do\r\nthe work of two was accomplished by the invention of the duplex system.\r\nIn duplex telegraphy two messages may be sent in opposite directions\r\nover the same wire at the same time. Let us take a look at some of the\r\nmethods by which this is accomplished.\r\n\r\nOne method with a long name but very simple in its working is the\r\ndifferential system (Fig. 66). In the differential system the current\r\nfrom the home battery divides into two branches passing around the coils\r\nof the electromagnet in opposite directions. Now if these two branches\r\nare so arranged that the currents flowing through them are equal, the\r\nrelay will not be magnetized, because one current would tend to make the\r\nend A a north pole, and the other current would tend to make the same\r\nend a south pole. The result is that the relay coil is not magnetized,\r\nand does not attract the armature. But the current from the distant\r\nbattery comes over one of these branches only, and will magnetize the\r\nrelay. Hence, with a similar arrangement at the second station, two\r\nmessages may be sent at the same time in opposite directions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 66--HOW TWO MESSAGES ARE SENT OVER ONE WIRE AT THE\r\nSAME TIME]\r\n\r\nAnother method not quite so simple in principle is the bridge method.\r\nWhen the key at station _A_ (see Fig. 67) is closed, the current from\r\nthe battery at station _A_ divides at _C_, and if the resistances _1_\r\nand _2_ are equal, and the resistance _3_ is equal to the resistance of\r\nthe line, no current will flow through the sounder. But if a current\r\ncomes over the line from the distant station this current divides at\r\n_D_, and a part goes through the sounder, causing it to click. The\r\nsounder is not affected, therefore, by the current from the home\r\nbattery, but is affected by the current from the distant battery.\r\nTherefore, a message may be sent and another received at the same time.\r\nIf there is a similar arrangement at the other station, two messages may\r\ntravel over the line in opposite directions at the same time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 67--HOW TWO MESSAGES ARE SENT OVER ONE WIRE AT THE\r\nSAME TIME. BRIDGE METHOD]\r\n\r\nThe differential method is used in land telegraphy, the bridge method\r\nalmost exclusively in submarine telegraphy. The next step was a\r\nquadruplex system, by means of which four messages may be transmitted\r\nover one wire at the same time. The first quadruplex system was invented\r\nby Edison in 1874, and in four years it saved more than half a million\r\ndollars. Other systems have been invented which make it possible to send\r\neven a larger number of messages at one time over a single wire.\r\n\r\n    The Telephone\r\n\r\nThe idea of \"talking by telegraph\" began to grow in the minds of\r\ninventors soon after the Morse instrument came into use. The sound of\r\nthe voice causes vibrations in the air. (This is simply shown in the\r\nstring telephone. This telephone is made by stretching a thin membrane,\r\nsuch as thin sheepskin, or gold-beaters' skin, over a round frame of\r\nwood or metal. Two such instruments are connected by a string, the end\r\nof the string being fastened to the middle of the stretched membrane.\r\nThe sound of the voice causes this membrane to vibrate. As the membrane\r\nmoves rapidly back and forth, it pulls and releases the string, and so\r\ncauses the membrane at the other end to vibrate and give out the sound.\r\nThis is the actual carrying of the sound vibrations along the string.)\r\nIn the telephone it is not sound vibrations but an electric current that\r\ntravels over the line wire. The telephone message, therefore, travels\r\nwith the speed of electricity, not with the speed of sound. If it\r\ntravelled with the speed of sound in air, a message spoken in Chicago\r\nwould be heard in New York one hour later; but we know that a message\r\nspoken in Chicago may be heard in New York the instant it is spoken.\r\n\r\nThe telephone, like the telegraph, depends on the electromagnet. The\r\nthought of inventors at first was to make the vibrations of a thin\r\nmembrane, caused by the sound of the voice, open and close a telegraphic\r\ncircuit. An electromagnet at the other end of the line would cause a\r\nthin membrane with a piece of soft iron attached to it to vibrate, just\r\nas the magnet in the telegraph receiver pulls and releases the\r\nsoft-iron armature as the circuit is made and broken. The thin membrane\r\ncaused to vibrate in this way would give out the sound. A telephone on\r\nthis principle was invented by Philip Reis, a schoolmaster in Germany.\r\nThe transmitter was carved out of wood in the shape of a human ear, the\r\nthin membrane being in the position of the ear-drum. Musical sounds and\r\neven words were transmitted by this telephone, but it could never have\r\nbeen successful as a practical working telephone. The membrane in the\r\nreceiver would vibrate with the same speed as the membrane in the\r\ntransmitter, but sound depends on something more than speed of\r\nvibration.\r\n\r\nThe Bell telephone, as known to-day, began with a study of the human\r\near. Alexander Graham Bell was a teacher of the deaf. His aim was to\r\nteach the deaf to use spoken language, and for this purpose he wished to\r\nlearn the nature of the vibrations caused by the voice. His plan was to\r\ncause the ear itself to trace on smoked glass the waves produced by the\r\ndifferent letters of the alphabet, and to use these tracings in teaching\r\nthe deaf. Accordingly, a human ear was mounted on a suitable support,\r\nthe stirrup-bone removed, leaving two bones attached, and a stylus of\r\nwheat straw attached to one of the bones. The ear-drum, caused to\r\nvibrate by the sound, moved the two small bones and the pointer of\r\nstraw, so that when he sang or talked to the ear delicate tracings were\r\nmade on the glass.\r\n\r\nThis experiment suggested to Mr. Bell that a membrane heavier than the\r\near-drum would move a heavier weight. If the ear-drum, no thicker than\r\ntissue-paper, could move the bones of the ear, a heavier membrane might\r\nvibrate a piece of iron in front of an electromagnet. He was at the\r\nsame time devising a telegraph for transmitting messages by means of\r\nmusical sounds. In this telegraph he was using an electromagnet in the\r\ntransmitter and another electromagnet in the receiver. He attached the\r\nsoft-iron armature of each electromagnet to a stretched membrane of\r\ngold-beaters' skin, expecting that the sound of his voice would cause\r\nthe membrane of the transmitter to vibrate, and that, by means of the\r\nelectromagnets, the membrane of the receiver would be made to vibrate in\r\nthe same way (Fig. 68). At first he was disappointed, but after making\r\nsome changes in the armatures a distinct sound was heard in the\r\nreceiver. Later the membrane was discarded, and a thin iron disk used\r\nwith better effect.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 68--FIRST BELL TELEPHONE RECEIVER AND TRANSMITTER\r\n  The receiver is on the left in the picture. A thin membrane of\r\ngold-beaters' skin tightly stretched and fastened with a cord can be\r\nseen on the end of the transmitter and of the receiver. An electromagnet\r\nis also shown over each membrane. This thin membrane, with a piece of\r\nsoft iron attached, was used in place of the soft-iron disk of the\r\nmodern receiver.]\r\n\r\nThe story of Bell's struggles might seem like the repetition of the life\r\nstory of many another great inventor. He knew that he had discovered\r\nsomething of great value to the world. He devoted his time to the\r\nperfecting of the telephone, neglecting his professional work and\r\nfinally giving it up, that he might give his whole time to his\r\ninvention. He was forced to endure poverty and ridicule. He was called\r\n\"a crank who says he can talk through a wire.\" Men said his invention\r\ncould never be made practical. Even after he succeeded in finding a few\r\npurchasers and some of the telephones were in actual use, people were\r\nslow to adopt it. The idea of talking at a piece of iron and hearing\r\nanother piece of iron talk seemed like a kind of witchcraft.\r\n\r\nIn the telephone we see another use of the electromagnet. A very thin\r\niron disk near the poles of an electromagnet forms the telephone\r\nreceiver (Fig. 69). An electric current travels over the telephone wire.\r\nIf the current grows stronger, the magnet is made stronger and pulls\r\nthe disk toward it. If the current grows weaker, the magnet becomes\r\nweaker and does not pull so hard on the disk. The disk then springs back\r\nfrom the magnet. If these changes take place rapidly the disk moves back\r\nand forth rapidly and gives out a sound. The sound of the voice at the\r\nother end of the line sets the disk in the mouthpiece vibrating. The\r\nvibrations of this disk cause the changes in the electric current\r\nflowing over the line-wire, and the changes in the electric current\r\ncause the disk of the receiver to vibrate in exactly the same way as the\r\ndisk at the mouthpiece. Thus the words spoken into the mouthpiece may be\r\nheard at the receiver.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 69--A TELEPHONE RECEIVER]\r\n\r\nThe transmitter used by Bell was like the receiver. Two receivers from\r\nthe common telephone connected by two wires may be used as a telephone\r\nwithout batteries. Fig. 70 shows a complete telephone made of two\r\nreceivers connected by two wires. The disk in one receiver which is now\r\nused as a transmitter is made to vibrate by the sound of the voice. Now\r\nwhen a piece of iron moves back and forth in a magnetic field it\r\nstrengthens and weakens the field. So the magnetic field in the\r\ntransmitter is rapidly changed by the movement of the iron disk. Now we\r\nhave found that whenever a coil of wire is in a changing magnetic field\r\na current is induced in the coil. The small coil in the transmitter,\r\ntherefore, has a current induced in it. We have also found that when the\r\nmagnetic field is made stronger the induced current flows in one\r\ndirection, and when the field is made weaker the current flows in the\r\nopposite direction. Since the field in the transmitter is made\r\nalternately stronger and weaker, the current in the coil flows first in\r\none direction, then in the opposite direction--that is, we have an\r\nalternating current. This alternating current, of course, flows over the\r\nline-wire and through the coil in the receiver. In the receiver the\r\nalternating current will alternately strengthen and weaken the magnetic\r\nfield, and as it does so the pull of the magnet on the iron disk is\r\nstrengthened and weakened. The iron disk in the receiver, therefore,\r\nvibrates in exactly the same way as the disk in the transmitter, and so\r\ngives out a sound just like that which is acting on the transmitter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 70--TWO RECEIVERS USED AS A COMPLETE TELEPHONE]\r\n\r\nIn the Blake transmitter, which is now commonly used, the disk moves a\r\npencil of carbon which presses against another pencil of carbon. This\r\nvaries the pressure between the two pencils of carbon. A battery current\r\nflows through the two carbons, and as the pressure of the carbons\r\nchanges the strength of the current changes. When the carbons are\r\npressed together more closely the current is stronger. When the pressure\r\nis less the current is weaker. We have, then, a varying current through\r\nthe carbons. This current flows through the primary coil of an\r\ninduction-coil, the secondary being connected to the line-wire. Now a\r\ncurrent of varying strength in the primary induces an alternating\r\ncurrent in the secondary. We have, then, an alternating current flowing\r\nover the line-wire. This alternating current acts on the magnetic field\r\nof the receiver in the way described before, causing the disk in the\r\nreceiver to vibrate and give out the sound.\r\n\r\nFor long-distance work a carbon-dust transmitter (Fig. 71) is used. In\r\nthis there are many granules of carbon, so that instead of two\r\ncarbon-points in contact there are many. This makes the transmitter more\r\nsensitive.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 71--CARBON-DUST TRANSMITTER]\r\n\r\nThe strength of current required for the telephone is very small. To\r\ntransmit a telephone message requires less than a hundred-millionth part\r\nof the current required for a telegraphic message. The work done in\r\nlifting the telephone receiver a distance of one foot, if changed into\r\nan alternating current, would be sufficient to keep up a sound in the\r\nreceiver for a hundred thousand years. Because of its extreme\r\nsensitiveness the telephone requires a complete wire circuit. The earth\r\ncannot be used for the return circuit, as in the case of the telegraph.\r\nDisturbances in the earth, vibration, leakage currents from trolley\r\nlines, and so forth, would interfere seriously with the action of the\r\ntelephone.\r\n\r\nWhen the telephone was invented it was commonly remarked that it could\r\nnot take the place of the telegraph in commerce, for the latter gave the\r\nmerchant some evidence of a business transaction, while the telephone\r\nleft no sign. There was a time when men feared to trust each other, but\r\nnow large business deals are made by telephone; products of the farm,\r\nthe factory, and the mine are bought and sold in immense quantities\r\nwithout a written contract or even the written evidence of a telegram.\r\nThus the telephone has developed a spirit of business honor.\r\n\r\n    The Phonograph\r\n\r\nThe phonograph grew out of the telephone. It is said to be the only one\r\nof Edison's inventions that came by accident, yet only a man of genius\r\nwould have seen the meaning of such an accident. He was singing into the\r\nmouthpiece of a telephone when the vibrations of the disk caused a fine\r\nsteel point to pierce one of his fingers held just behind the disk. This\r\nset him to thinking. If the sound of his voice could cause the disk to\r\nvibrate with force enough to pierce the skin, would it not make\r\nimpressions on tin-foil, and so make a record of the voice that could be\r\nreproduced by passing the point rapidly over the same impressions? He\r\ngave his assistants the necessary instructions, and soon the first\r\nphonograph was made.\r\n\r\nThis disk in the phonograph is set in vibration by sound vibrations in\r\nthe air in the same way as the disk in the telephone transmitter.\r\nAttached to the disk is a needle-point which, of course, vibrates with\r\nthe disk. If a cylinder with a soft surface is turned rapidly under the\r\nsteel point as it vibrates, impressions are made in the cylinder\r\ncorresponding to the movements of the disk. The cylinder must move\r\nforward as it turns, so that its path will be a spiral. If, now, the\r\nstylus is placed at the starting-point and the cylinder turned rapidly\r\nthe stylus will move rapidly up and down as it goes over the\r\nindentations in the cylinder, and so cause the metal disk to vibrate and\r\ngive out a sound like that received at first. In the earliest\r\nphonographs the cylinder was covered with tin-foil. Later the so-called\r\n\"wax records\" came into use. These cylinders are not made of wax, but of\r\nvery hard soap. Fig. 72 shows an instrument in which the sound of the\r\nvoice caused a pencil-point to trace a wavy line on a cylinder. This\r\ninstrument may be called a forerunner of the phonograph. Fig. 73 shows\r\nEdison's first phonograph with a modern instrument placed beside it for\r\ncomparison.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 72--THE PHONAUTOGRAPH, A FORERUNNER OF THE\r\nPHONOGRAPH]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 73 EDISON'S FIRST PHONOGRAPH AND A MODERN INSTRUMENT\r\n  Photo by Claudy.]\r\n\r\n    Gas-Engines\r\n\r\nCannons are the oldest gas-engines. Indeed, the principle of the cannon\r\nis the same as that of the modern gas-engine, the piston in the engine\r\ntaking the place of the cannon-ball. The power in each case is obtained\r\nby explosion--in the cannon the explosion of powder, in the engine the\r\nexplosion of a mixture of air and gas. Powder-engines with pistons were\r\nproposed in the seventeenth century, and some were actually built, but\r\nit proved too difficult to control them, and the idea of the gas-engine\r\nwas abandoned for more than a hundred years.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of coal-gas near the close of the eighteenth century gave\r\na new impetus to the gas-engine. John Barber, an Englishman, built the\r\nfirst actual gas-engine. He used gas distilled from wood, coal, or oil.\r\nThe gas, mixed with the proper proportion of air, was introduced into a\r\ntank which he called the exploder. The mixture was fired and issued out\r\nin a continuous stream of flame against the vanes of a paddle-wheel,\r\ndriving them round with great force.\r\n\r\nIn 1804 Lebon, a French engineer, was assassinated, and the progress of\r\nthe gas-engine set back a number of years, for this engineer had\r\nproposed to compress the mixture of gas and air before firing, and to\r\nfire the mixture by an electric spark. This is the method used in\r\ngas-engines to-day.\r\n\r\nThe first practical working gas-engine was invented by Lenoir, a\r\nFrenchman, in 1860. From this time to the end of the century the\r\ngas-engine developed rapidly, receiving a new impulse from the\r\nincreasing demand for the motor-car.\r\n\r\nThe engine of the German inventors, Otto and Langen, brought out in\r\n1876, marked the beginning of a new era. The greater number of engines\r\nused in automobiles to-day are of the kind known as the Otto cycle, or\r\nfour-cycle, engine. This engine is called four-cycle because the piston\r\nmakes four strokes for every explosion. There is one stroke to admit the\r\nmixture of gas and air to the cylinder, another to compress the gas and\r\nair, at the beginning of the third stroke the explosion takes place, and\r\nin the fourth stroke the burned-out gases are driven out of the\r\ncylinder. The working of the four-cycle gas-engine is made clear in\r\nFigs. 74, 75, 76, and 77.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 74--FIRST STROKE. GAS AND AIR ADMITTED TO THE\r\nCYLINDER]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 75--SECOND STROKE. MIXTURE OF GAS AND AIR\r\nCOMPRESSED]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 76--THIRD STROKE. THE MIXTURE IS EXPLODED AND\r\nEXPANDS, DRIVING THE PISTON FORWARD]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 77--FOURTH STROKE, EXHAUST. THE BURNED-OUT MIXTURE\r\nOF GAS AND AIR EXPELLED FROM THE CYLINDER]\r\n\r\n    THE FOUR-CYCLE GAS-ENGINE\r\n\r\nIn such a gas-engine the power is applied to the piston only in one\r\nstroke out of every four, while in the steam-engine the power is applied\r\nat every stroke. It would seem, therefore, that a steam-engine would do\r\nmore work than a gas-engine for the same amount of heat, but such is not\r\nthe case; in fact, a good gas-engine will do about twice as much work as\r\na good steam-engine for the same amount of fuel. The reason is that the\r\nsteam-engine wastes its heat. Heat is given to the condenser, to the\r\niron of the boiler, to the connecting pipes and the air around them,\r\nwhile in the gas-engine the heat is produced in the cylinder by the\r\nexplosion and the power applied directly to the piston-head. More than\r\nthis, a steam-engine when at rest wastes heat; there must be a fire\r\nunder the boiler if the engine is to be ready for use on short notice.\r\nWhen a gas-engine is at rest there is no fire, nothing is being used up,\r\nand yet the engine can be started very quickly. A gas-engine can be made\r\nmuch lighter than a steam-engine of the same horse-power. The automobile\r\nand the flying-machine require very light engines. Without the\r\ngas-engine the automobile would have remained imperfect and crude, while\r\nthe flying-machine would have been impossible.\r\n\r\nIn a two-cycle gas-engine there is an explosion for every two strokes of\r\nthe piston, or one explosion for every revolution of the crank-shaft.\r\nDuring one stroke the mixture of gas and air on one side of the piston\r\nis compressed and a new mixture enters on the opposite side of the\r\npiston. At the end of this stroke the compressed mixture is exploded,\r\nand power is applied to the piston during about one-fourth of the next\r\nstroke. During the remainder of the second stroke the burned-out gas\r\nescapes, and the fresh mixture passes over from one side of the piston\r\nto the other ready for compression. The two-cycle engine is simpler in\r\nconstruction than the four-cycle, having no valves. It also has less\r\nweight per horse-power. The cylinder of a two-cycle engine is shown in\r\nFig. 78.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 78--TWO-CYCLE GAS-ENGINE. CRANK AND CONNECTING-ROD\r\nARE ENCLOSED WITH THE PISTON]\r\n\r\nA steam-engine is self-starting. The engineer has only to turn the steam\r\ninto the cylinder, but the gas-engine requires to be turned until at\r\nleast one explosion takes place, for until there is an explosion of gas\r\nand air in the cylinder there is no power.\r\n\r\nA gas-engine may have a number of cylinders. Four-cylinder and\r\nsix-cylinder engines are common. In a four-cylinder, four-cycle engine,\r\nwhile one cylinder is on the power stroke the next is on the compression\r\nstroke, the third on the admission stroke, and the fourth on the exhaust\r\nstroke. Fig. 79 shows the Selden \"explosion buggy\" propelled by a\r\ngas-engine. This machine was the forerunner of the modern automobile.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 79--SELDEN \"EXPLOSION BUGGY.\" FORERUNNER OF THE\r\nMODERN AUTOMOBILE]\r\n\r\n    The Steam Locomotive\r\n\r\nLate in the eighteenth century a mischievous boy put some water in a\r\ngun-barrel, rammed down a tight wad, and placed the barrel in the fire\r\nof a blacksmith's forge. The wad was thrown out with a loud report, and\r\nthe boy's play-mate, Oliver Evans, thought he had discovered a new\r\npower. The prank with the gun-barrel set young Evans thinking about the\r\npower of steam. It was not long until he read a description of a\r\nNewcomen engine. In the Newcomen engine, you will remember, it was the\r\npressure of air, not the pressure of steam, that lifted the weight.\r\nEvans soon set about building an engine in which the pressure of steam\r\nshould do the work. He is sometimes called the \"Watt of America,\" for he\r\ndid in America much the same work that Watt did in Scotland. Evans built\r\nthe first successful non-condensing engine--that is, an engine in which\r\nthe steam, after driving the piston, escapes into the air instead of\r\ninto a condenser. The non-condensing engine made the locomotive\r\npossible, for a locomotive could not conveniently carry a condenser.\r\nEvans made a locomotive which travelled very slowly. He said, however:\r\n\"The time will come when people will travel in stages moved by\r\nsteam-engines from one city to another, almost as fast as birds can fly,\r\nfifteen or twenty miles an hour.\"\r\n\r\nThe inventor who made the first successful locomotive was George\r\nStephenson, and it is worth noting that one of his engines, the\r\n\"Rocket,\" possessed all the elements of the modern locomotive. He\r\ncombined in the \"Rocket\" the tubular boiler, the forced draft, and\r\ndirect connection of the piston-rod to the crank-pin of the\r\ndriving-wheel.\r\n\r\nThe \"Rocket\" was used on the first steam railway (the Stockton &\r\nDarlington, in England), which was opened in 1825. There had been other\r\nrailways for hauling coal by means of horses over iron tracks, and other\r\nlocomotives that travelled over an ordinary road; but this was the first\r\nroad on which a steam-engine pulled a load over an iron track, the\r\nfirst real railroad. Fig. 80 shows the \"Rocket\" and two other early\r\nlocomotives.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 80--SOME EARLY LOCOMOTIVES\r\n  The one on the right is Stephenson's \"Rocket.\"\r\n  Photo by Claudy.]\r\n\r\nIn order to build a railroad between Liverpool and Manchester for\r\ncarrying both passengers and freight it was necessary to secure an act\r\nof Parliament. Stephenson was compelled to undergo a severe\r\ncross-examination by a committee of Parliament, who feared there would\r\nbe great danger if the speed of the trains were as high as twelve miles\r\nan hour. He was asked:\r\n\r\n\"Have you seen a railroad that would stand a speed of twelve miles an\r\nhour?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where?\"\r\n\r\n\"Any railroad that would bear going four miles an hour. I mean to say\r\nthat if it would bear the weight at four miles an hour it would bear it\r\nat twelve.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean to say that it would not require a stronger railway to\r\ncarry the same weight at twelve miles an hour?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will give an answer to that. I dare say every person has been over\r\nice when skating, or seen persons go over, and they know that it would\r\nbear them better at a greater velocity than it would if they went\r\nslower; when they go quickly the weight, in a measure, ceases.\"\r\n\r\n\"Would not that imply that the road must be perfect?\"\r\n\r\n\"It would, and I mean to make it perfect.\"\r\n\r\nFor seven miles the road must be built over a peat bog into which a\r\nstone would sink to unknown depths. To convince the committee, however,\r\nand secure the act of Parliament was more difficult than to build the\r\nroad. But Stephenson was one of the men who do things because they\r\nnever give up, and the road was built.\r\n\r\n    How a Locomotive Works\r\n\r\nTo understand how a locomotive works, let us consider how the steam is\r\nproduced, how it acts on the piston, and how it is controlled. The steam\r\nis produced in a locomotive in exactly the same way that steam is\r\nproduced in a tea-kettle. Now everybody knows that a quart of water in a\r\ntea-kettle with a wide bottom placed on a stove will boil more quickly\r\nthan the same amount of water in a tea-pot with a narrow bottom. The\r\ngreater the heating-surface--that is, the greater the surface of heated\r\nmetal in contact with the water--the more quickly the water will boil\r\nand the more quickly steam can be produced. In a locomotive the aim is\r\nto use as large a heating-surface as possible. This is done by making\r\nthe fire-box double and allowing the water to circulate in the space\r\nbetween the inner and outer parts, except underneath; also by placing\r\ntubes in the boiler through which the heated gases and smoke from the\r\nfire must pass. An ordinary locomotive contains two hundred or more of\r\nthese tubes. The water surrounds these tubes, and is therefore in\r\ncontact with a very large surface of heated metal. In some engines the\r\nwater is in the tubes, and the heated gases surround the tubes.\r\n\r\nThe steam as it enters the cylinder should be dry--that is, it should\r\nnot contain drops of water. This is accomplished by allowing the steam\r\nfrom the boiler to pass into a dome above the boiler. Here the steam,\r\nwhich is nearly dry, enters a steam-pipe leading to the cylinder (Fig.\r\n81). The steam is admitted to the cylinder by means of a slide-valve.\r\nFrom the diagram it can easily be seen that the valve admits steam first\r\non one side of the piston, then on the other. It can also be seen that\r\nthe valve closes the admission-port, and so cuts off the steam before\r\nthe piston has made a full stroke. The steam that is shut up in the\r\ncylinder continues to expand and act on the piston. At the same time the\r\nvalve opens the exhaust-port, allowing the steam to escape from the\r\nother side of the piston; but it closes this port before the piston has\r\nquite finished the stroke. The small quantity of steam thus shut up acts\r\nlike a cushion to prevent the piston striking the end of the cylinder\r\nwith too great force. The exhaust-steam escapes through a blast-pipe\r\ninto the chimney, drives the air before it up the chimney, and thus\r\nmakes a greater draft of air through the fire-box. This is called the\r\nforced draft. The escape of the exhaust-steam causes the puffing of the\r\nlocomotive just after starting. After the engine is under way the\r\nengineer partly shuts off the steam by means of the reversing lever and\r\nthe puffing is less noticeable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 81--HOW A LOCOMOTIVE WORKS\r\n  The arrows show the course of the steam.]\r\n\r\nThe action of the steam may be summed up as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Steam admitted to the cylinder (admission).\r\n\r\n2. Valve closes admission-port (cut-off).\r\n\r\n3. Steam shut up in the cylinder expands, acting on the piston\r\n(expansion period).\r\n\r\n4. Valve opens exhaust-port to allow used steam to escape (exhaust).\r\n\r\nThe devices for controlling the steam are the throttle-valve and the\r\nvalve-gear. The throttle-valve is at the entrance to the steam-pipe in\r\nthe steam-dome. This valve is opened and closed by means of a rod in the\r\nengineer's cab.\r\n\r\nStephenson's link-motion valve-gear is used on most locomotives. The\r\nforward rod in the diagram is in position to act upon the valve-rod\r\nthrough the lever _L_. Suppose the reversing-lever is drawn back to the\r\ndotted line; then the forward rod will be raised and the backward rod\r\nwill come into position to act on the lever _L_. If this is done while\r\nthe locomotive is at rest the valve is moved through one-half a complete\r\nstroke. In the diagram the steam enters the cylinder on the right of the\r\npiston. After this movement of the valve the steam would enter on the\r\nleft side of the piston. In the present position the locomotive would\r\nmove forward, but if the valve is changed so as to admit steam to the\r\nleft of the piston while the connecting-rod is in the position shown\r\nthen the engine will move backward. Thus the direction can be controlled\r\nby the engineer in the cab. Of course, this can be done while the engine\r\nis in motion. The forward rod and the backward rod are each moved by an\r\neccentric on the axle of the front driving-wheel. The two eccentrics are\r\nin opposite positions on the axle. An eccentric acts just like a crank,\r\ncausing the rod to move forward and backward as the axle turns, and of\r\ncourse this motion is given to the valve-rod through the lever. When the\r\nlink is set midway between the forward and the backward rod the valve\r\ncannot move. When the link is raised or lowered part way the valve makes\r\na short stroke, and less steam is admitted to the cylinder than with a\r\nfull stroke. In starting the locomotive the valve is set to make a full\r\nstroke. When the train is under headway the valve is set for a short\r\nstroke to economize steam. The valve-gear and the throttle-valve\r\ntogether take the place of the governor in the stationary engine, but\r\nwhile the governor acts automatically these are controlled by the\r\nengineer.\r\n\r\nIn reality a locomotive is two engines, one on either side, connected to\r\nthe same driving-wheels. But the two piston-rods are connected to the\r\ndriving-wheels at points which are at right angles with each other, so\r\nthat when the crank on one side is at the end of a stroke--the \"dead\r\ncentre\"--that on the other side is on the quarter, either above or below\r\nthe axle, ready for applying the greatest turning force.\r\n\r\nThe expansion-engine was designed to use more of the power of the steam\r\nthan can be done in the single-cylinder engine. In the double\r\nexpansion-engine the steam expands from one cylinder into another. The\r\nsecond cylinder must be larger in diameter than the first. In the triple\r\nexpansion-engine the steam expands from the second cylinder into a\r\nthird, still larger. The second and third cylinders use a large part of\r\nthe power that would be wasted with only one cylinder.\r\n\r\n    The Turbine\r\n\r\nOne of the great inventions relating to steam-power is the\r\nsteam-turbine. The water-turbine is equally useful in relation to\r\nwater-power. The water-turbine and the steam-turbine work in very much\r\nthe same way, the difference being due to the fact that steam expands as\r\nit drives the engine, while water drives it by its weight in falling, or\r\nby its motion as it rushes in a swift stream or jet against the blades\r\nof the turbine.\r\n\r\nThe first steam-engine, that of Hero in the time of Archimedes, was a\r\nform of turbine (Fig. 82). It was driven by the reaction of the steam as\r\nit escaped into the air. The common lawn-sprinkler, that whirls as the\r\nwater rushes through it, is a water-turbine that works in the same way.\r\n\"Barker's Mill\" is the name applied to a water-turbine that works like\r\nthe lawn-sprinkler. As the water rushes out of the opening it pushes\r\nagainst the air. It cannot push against the air without pushing back at\r\nthe same time. Never yet has any person or object in nature been able to\r\npush in one direction only. It cannot be done. If you push a cart\r\nforward you push backward against the ground at the same time. If there\r\nwere nothing for you to push back against your forward push would not\r\nmove the cart a hair's-breadth. If you doubt this, try to push a cart\r\nwhen you are standing on ice so slippery that you cannot get a foothold.\r\nIt is the backward push of the water in the lawn-sprinkler and the\r\nbackward push of the steam in Hero's engine that cause the machine to\r\nturn.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 82--HERO'S ENGINE]\r\n\r\nThe turbines in common use for both water and steam power have curved\r\nblades. The reason for curving the blades can best be seen by referring\r\nto an early form of water-wheel. The best water-turbine is only an\r\nimproved form of water-wheel. The first water-wheels had flat blades,\r\nand these answered very well so long as only a low power was needed and\r\nit was not necessary to save the power of the water. It was found,\r\nhowever, that there was a great waste of power in the wheel with flat\r\nblades. One inventor proposed to improve the wheel by curving the blades\r\nin such a way that the water would glide up the curve and then drop\r\ndirectly downward (Fig. 83). The water then gives up practically all of\r\nits power to the wheel and falls from the wheel. It would have no power\r\nto move a second wheel. In this way he used practically all the power\r\nof the water. To save the power of the water by making all of the water\r\nstrike the wheel at high speed the channel was made narrow just above\r\nthe wheel, forming a mill-race. This applies to the undershot wheel. In\r\nthe overshot wheel (Fig. 84) the power depends on the weight of the\r\nwater and on its height. The water runs into buckets attached to the\r\nwheel, and, as it falls in these buckets, turns the wheel. The undershot\r\nwheel and the mill-race represent a common form of turbine, that form\r\nin which the steam or the water is forced in a jet against a set of\r\ncurved blades. Fig. 85 shows a steam-turbine run by a jet of steam. In\r\nthe water-turbine there are two sets of blades. One set rotates, the\r\nother remains fixed. The use of the fixed blades is to turn the water\r\nand drive it in the right direction against the moving blades. In some\r\nforms of turbine there are more than two sets of blades. The steam, as\r\nit passes through, gives up some of its power to each set of blades\r\nuntil, after passing the last set, it has given up nearly all its power.\r\nThe action of the steam in this turbine is somewhat like that in the\r\nexpansion-engine, in which the steam gives up a portion of its power in\r\neach cylinder. Fig. 86 is from a photograph of a modern steam-turbine,\r\nand Fig. 87 is a drawing of the same turbine showing the course of the\r\nsteam. Fig. 88 is a turbine that runs a large dynamo.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 83--AN UNDERSHOT WATER-WHEEL WITH CURVED BLADES]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 84--AN OVERSHOT WATER-WHEEL]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 85--DE LAVAL STEAM-TURBINE\r\n  Driven by a jet of steam striking the blades.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 86--A MODERN STEAM-TURBINE WITH TOP CASING RAISED\r\nSHOWING BLADES]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 87--DIAGRAM OF TURBINE SHOWN IN FIG. 86\r\n  The arrows show the course of the steam.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 88--A STEAM-TURBINE THAT RUNS A DYNAMO GENERATING\r\n14,000 ELECTRICAL HORSE-POWER\r\n  The steam enters through the large pipe at the left.]\r\n\r\nIn 1897, as the battle-ships of the British fleet were assembled to\r\ncelebrate the Diamond jubilee of Queen Victoria, a little vessel a\r\nhundred feet long darted in and out among the giant ships, defied the\r\npatrol-boats whose duty it was to keep out intruders, and raced down the\r\nlines of battle-ships at the then unheard-of speed of thirty-five knots\r\nan hour. It was the _Turbinia_, fitted with the Parsons turbine. This\r\nevent marked the beginning of the modern turbine. It also marked the\r\nbeginning of a revolution in steam propulsion.\r\n\r\nThe Parsons turbine does not use the jet method, but the steam enters\r\nnear the centre of the wheel and flows toward the rim, passing over a\r\nnumber of rows of curved blades. The Parsons turbine is used on the\r\nfastest ocean liners. The _Lusitania_, one of the fastest steamships in\r\nthe first decade of the twentieth century, has two sets of high and low\r\npressure turbines with a total of 68,000 horse-power.\r\n\r\nThe windmill is a form of turbine driven by the air. As the air rushes\r\nagainst the blades of the windmill, it forces them to turn. If the\r\nwindmill were turned by some mechanical power, it would drive the air\r\nback, and we should have a blower. This is what we have in the electric\r\nfan, a small windmill driven by an electric motor so that it drives the\r\nair instead of being driven by it. The blades of the windmill and the\r\nelectric fan are shaped very much like the screw propeller. The screw\r\npropeller, driven by an engine, would drive the water back if the ship\r\nwere firmly anchored, just as the fan drives the air. But it cannot\r\ndrive the water back without pushing forward on the ship at the same\r\ntime, and this forward push propels the ship. It is difficult to attain\r\nwhat is now regarded as high speed with a single screw. With engines in\r\npairs and two lines of shafting higher power can be used. The best\r\nsteamers, therefore, are fitted with the twin-screw propeller. Some\r\nlarge steamers have three and some four screws.\r\n\r\nThe screw propellers of turbine steamships are made of small diameter,\r\nthat they may rotate at high speed without undue waste of power. By the\r\nuse of turbine engines and twin-screw propellers, the weight of the\r\nmachinery has been greatly reduced. The old paddle-wheels, with\r\nlow-pressure engines, developed only about two horse-power for each ton\r\nof machinery. The turbine, with the twin-screw propeller, develops from\r\nsix to seven horse-power for every ton of machinery. The modern steamer,\r\nwith all its machinery and coal for an Atlantic voyage, weighs no more\r\nthan the engines of the old paddle-wheel type and coal would weigh for\r\nthe same horse-power. The steam-turbine and the twin-screw propeller\r\nhave made rapid ocean travel possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VI\r\n\r\nTHE TWENTIETH-CENTURY OUTLOOK\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the latter half of the nineteenth century was a time\r\nof invention. It was a time when the great discoveries of many centuries\r\nbore fruit in great inventions. It was thought by some scientists that\r\nall the great discoveries had been made, and that all that remained was\r\ncareful work in applying the great principles that had been discovered.\r\nSo far was this from being true that in the last ten years of the\r\nnineteenth century discoveries were made more startling, if possible,\r\nthan any that had preceded. The nineteenth century not only brought\r\nforth many great inventions, but handed down to the twentieth century a\r\nseries of discoveries that point the way to still greater inventions.\r\n\r\n    Air-Ships\r\n\r\nFor centuries men sailed over the water at the mercy of the wind. The\r\nsailing vessel is helpless in a storm. Early in the nineteenth century\r\nthey learned to use the power of steam for ocean travel, and the wind\r\nlost its terrors. Late in the eighteenth century men learned to sail\r\nthrough the air in balloons even more at the mercy of the wind than the\r\nsailing vessels on the ocean. More than a hundred years later they\r\nlearned to propel air-ships in the teeth of the wind. The nineteenth\r\ncentury saw the mastery of the water. The twentieth is witnessing the\r\nmastery of the air.\r\n\r\nThe first balloon ascension was made in 1783, two men being carried over\r\nParis by what Benjamin Franklin called a \"bag of smoke.\" The balloon was\r\na bag of oiled silk open at the bottom. In the middle of the opening was\r\na grate in which bundles of fagots and sheaves of straw were burned. The\r\nheated air filled the balloon, and as the heated air was lighter than\r\nthe air around it the balloon could rise and carry a load. Beneath the\r\ngrate was a wicker car for the men. They were supplied with straw and\r\nfagots with which to feed the fire. When they wanted to rise higher they\r\nadded fuel to heat the air in the balloon. When they wished to descend\r\nthey allowed the fire to die out, so that the air in the balloon would\r\ncool. They could not guide the balloon, but drifted with the wind. That\r\ngreat philosopher Benjamin Franklin, who saw the ascension, said that\r\nthe time might come when the balloon could be made to move in a calm and\r\nguided in a wind. In the second ascension bags of sand were taken as\r\nballast, and the car was suspended from a net which enclosed the\r\nballoon. In this second ascension hydrogen gas was used in place of\r\nheated air.\r\n\r\nThe greatest height ever reached by a human being is about seven miles.\r\nThis height was first reached in 1862 by two balloonists who nearly lost\r\ntheir lives in the adventure. At a height of nearly six miles one of the\r\nmen became unconscious. The other tried to pull the valve-cord to allow\r\nthe gas to escape, but found that the cord was out of his reach. His\r\nhands were frozen, but he climbed out of the car into the netting of the\r\nballoon, secured the cord in his teeth, returned to the car, and threw\r\nthe weight of his body on the cord. This opened the valve and the\r\nballoon descended.\r\n\r\nThose who go to great heights now provide themselves with tanks of\r\ncompressed oxygen. Then when the air becomes so thin and rare that\r\nbreathing is difficult they can breathe from the oxygen tanks.\r\n\r\nA captive balloon in war serves as an observation tower from which to\r\nobserve the enemy. It is connected to the ground by a cable. This cable\r\nis wound on a drum carried by the balloon wagon. The balloon can be\r\nlowered or raised by winding or unwinding the cable.\r\n\r\nThe gas-bag is sometimes made of oiled silk, sometimes of two layers of\r\ncotton cloth with vulcanized rubber between. The cotton cloth gives the\r\nstrength needed, and the rubber makes the bag gas-tight.\r\n\r\nThe most convenient gas for filling balloons is heated air, but the air\r\ncools rapidly and loses its lifting power. Coal-gas furnished by city\r\ngas-plants is sometimes used. This gas will lift about thirty-five\r\npounds for every thousand cubic feet. A balloon holding thirty-five\r\nthousand cubic feet of coal gas will easily lift the car and three\r\npersons. The lightest gas is hydrogen. This gas will lift about seventy\r\npounds for every thousand cubic feet. Hydrogen is made by the action of\r\nsulphuric acid and water on iron. If a bit of iron is thrown into a\r\nmixture of sulphuric acid and water bubbles of hydrogen gas will rise\r\nthrough the liquid. This gas will burn if a lighted match is brought\r\nnear.\r\n\r\nA balloon without propelling or steering apparatus is not an air-ship.\r\nIt may be raised by throwing out ballast or lowered by letting out gas,\r\nbut further than this the aeronaut has no control over its movements.\r\nThe balloon moves with the wind. No breeze is felt, for balloon and air\r\nmove together. To the aeronaut the balloon seems to be in a dead calm.\r\nIt is only when he catches sight of houses and trees and rivers darting\r\npast below that he realizes that the balloon is moving.\r\n\r\nIf a balloon has a propelling apparatus it may move against the wind, or\r\nit may outspeed the wind. A balloon with propelling and steering\r\napparatus is called a \"dirigible\" balloon, which means a balloon that\r\ncan be guided. Figs. 89 and 90 are from photographs of a \"dirigible\"\r\nused in the British army. Such a balloon is usually long and pointed\r\nlike a spindle or a cigar. It is built to cut the air, just as a rowboat\r\nbuilt for speed is long and pointed so that it may cut the water. The\r\npropeller acts like an electric fan. An electric fan drives the air\r\nbefore it, but the air pushes back on the fan just as much as the fan\r\npushes forward on the air, and if the fan were suspended by a long cord\r\nit would move backward. So the large fan or screw propeller on an\r\nair-ship drives the air backward, and the air reacts and drives the ship\r\nforward. In the same way the screw-propeller of an ocean liner drives\r\nthe vessel forward by the reaction of the water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 89--BRITISH ARMY AIR-SHIP \"NULLI SECUNDUS\" READY FOR\r\nFLIGHT]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 90--BASKET, MOTOR, AND PROPELLER OF THE BRITISH ARMY\r\nAIR-SHIP \"NULLI SECUNDUS\"]\r\n\r\nA balloon rises for the same reason that wood floats on water. The wood\r\nis lighter than water, and the water holds it up. The balloon is\r\nlighter than air and the air pushes it up. The upward push of the air is\r\njust equal to the weight of the air that would fill the same space the\r\nballoon fills. The balloon can support a load that makes the whole\r\nweight of the balloon and its load together equal to the weight of the\r\nair that would fill the same space. For the balloon to rise the load\r\nmust be somewhat lighter than this. A balloon may be made lighter than\r\nair by filling it with heated air or coal-gas. Hydrogen, however, is\r\nused in the better balloons and in air-ships of the \"lighter than air\"\r\ntype.\r\n\r\nThe air-ship must, of course, use a very light motor. A steam-engine\r\ncannot be made light enough. Neither can an electric motor, if we add\r\nthe weight of the storage battery that would be required. Air-ships have\r\nbeen propelled by both steam-engines and electric motors, but with low\r\nspeed because of the weight of the engine or motor. The only successful\r\nmotor for this purpose is the gasolene motor, which is a form of\r\ngas-engine using gas formed by the evaporation of gasolene.\r\n\r\nThe first air-ship that could be controlled and brought back to the\r\nstarting-point was made in France, in 1885, by Captain Renard, of the\r\nFrench army. It was a cigar-shaped balloon, with a screw propeller run\r\nby an electric motor of eight horse-power. The ship attained a speed of\r\nthirteen miles an hour.\r\n\r\nA more successful air-ship was that built by Santos Dumont. With this\r\nship, in 1901, he won a prize of $20,000, which had been offered to the\r\nbuilder of the first air-ship that would sail round the Eiffel Tower in\r\nParis from the Aerostatic Park of Vaugirard, a distance of about three\r\nmiles, and return in half an hour.\r\n\r\nThe balloon part of this air-ship was 112-1/2 feet long and 19-1/2 feet\r\nin diameter, holding about 6400 cubic feet of gas. The car was built of\r\npine beams no larger in section than two fingers and weighing only 110\r\npounds. This car could be taken apart and put in a trunk. A gasolene\r\nautomobile motor was used, and thus it is seen that the automobile aided\r\nin solving the problem of sailing through the air. It was the automobile\r\nthat led to the construction of light and powerful gasolene motors. The\r\ncar and motor were suspended from the balloon by means of piano wires,\r\nwhich at a short distance were invisible, so that the man in the car\r\nappeared in some mysterious way to follow the balloon. The ship was\r\nturned to the left or right by means of a rudder. It was made to ascend\r\nor descend by shifting the weight of a heavy rope that hung from the\r\ncar, thus inclining the ship upward or downward.\r\n\r\nCount Zeppelin, of Germany, constructed a much larger dirigible balloon\r\nthan that of Santos Dumont. The balloon of the first Zeppelin air-ship\r\nwas 390 feet in length, with a diameter of about 39 feet. It was divided\r\ninto seventeen sections, each section being a balloon in itself. These\r\nsections serve the same purpose as the water-tight compartments of a\r\nbattle-ship. An accident to one section would not mean the destruction\r\nof the entire ship. Within the balloon is a framework of aluminum rods\r\nextending from one end to the other and held in place by aluminum rings\r\ntwenty-four feet apart. The balloon contains about 108,000 cubic feet of\r\ngas, and it costs about $2500 to fill it. One filling of gas will last\r\nabout three weeks. There are two cars, each about ten feet long, five\r\nfeet wide, and three feet deep. The cars are connected by a narrow\r\npassageway made of aluminum wires and plates, making a walking distance\r\nof 326 feet--longer than the decks of many ocean steamers. A sliding\r\nweight of 300 kilograms (about 600 pounds) serves the same purpose as\r\nthe guide-ropes in the Santos Dumont air-ship. By moving this weight\r\nforward or backward the ship is raised or lowered at the bow or stern,\r\nand thus caused to glide up or down. Anchor-ropes are carried for use in\r\nlanding. The ship is propelled by four screws, and guided by a number\r\nof rudders placed some in front and some in the rear. The first Zeppelin\r\nair-ship carried four passengers. The work of Dumont and Zeppelin has\r\nled the great powers to manufacture dirigible balloons for use in time\r\nof war. Fig. 91 shows one of the Zeppelin air-ships sailing over a lake.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 91--A ZEPPELIN AIR-SHIP]\r\n\r\nA larger air-ship, the _Deutschland_, built later by Count Zeppelin, was\r\nthe first air-ship to be used for regular passenger service. The\r\n_Deutschland_ is shown in Fig. 92. The _Deutschland_ carried the crew\r\nand twenty passengers. It operated for a time as a regular passenger\r\nair-ship between Friedrichshafen and Düsseldorf, a distance of three\r\nhundred miles. The _Deutschland_ was wrecked in a storm on June 28,\r\n1910, but it was successfully operated long enough to give Germany the\r\nhonor of establishing the first air-ship line for regular passenger\r\nservice. This is an honor perhaps equally as great as that of\r\nestablishing the first commercial electric railway, which also belongs\r\nto Germany. An American army air-ship is shown in Fig. 93.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 92--COUNT ZEPPELIN'S \"DEUTSCHLAND,\" THE FIRST\r\nAIR-SHIP IN REGULAR PASSENGER SERVICE]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n  Copyright by Pictorial News Co.\r\nFIG. 93--THE BALDWIN AIR-SHIP USED IN THE UNITED STATES ARMY]\r\n\r\n    The Aeroplane\r\n\r\nThe aeroplane is a later development than the dirigible balloon. The\r\naeroplane is heavier than air. So is a bird and so is a kite. What\r\nsupports a kite or a bird as it soars? Every boy knows that the strings\r\nof a kite must be attached so that the kite is inclined and catches the\r\nwind underneath. Then the wind lifts the kite. In still air the kite\r\nwill not fly unless the boy who holds the string runs very fast and so\r\ncauses an artificial breeze to blow against the kite. In much the same\r\nway a hovering bird is held aloft by the wind. In a dead calm the bird\r\nmust flap its wings to keep afloat. If the kite string is cut the kite\r\ntips over and drops to the earth because it has lost its balance. The\r\nlifting power of the wind is well shown in the man-lifting kites which\r\nare used in the British army service. In a high wind a large kite is\r\nused in place of a captive balloon. It is a box-kite made of bamboo and\r\ncarries a passenger in a car, the car running on the cable which\r\nattaches the kite to the ground. Now suppose a kite with a motor and\r\npropeller in place of a string and a boy to run with it, and that the\r\nkite is able to balance itself, then it will sail against a wind of its\r\nown making and you have a flying-machine heavier than air.\r\n\r\nThe first aeroplane that would fly under perfect control of the operator\r\nwas built by the Wright brothers at Dayton, Ohio. When they were boys,\r\nBishop Wright gave his two sons, Orville and Wilbur, a toy flyer. From\r\nthat time on the thought of flying through the air was in their minds. A\r\nfew years later the death of Lilienthal, who was killed by a fall with\r\nhis glider in Germany, stirred them, and they took up the problem in\r\nearnest. They read all the writings of Lilienthal and became acquainted\r\nwith Mr. Octave Chanute, an engineer of Chicago who had made a\r\nsuccessful glider. They soon built a glider of their own, and\r\nexperimented with it each summer on the huge sand-dunes of the North\r\nCarolina coast.\r\n\r\nA glider is an aeroplane without a propeller. With it one can cast off\r\ninto the air from a great height and sail slowly to the ground. Before\r\nattempting to use a motor and propeller, the Wrights learned to control\r\nthe glider perfectly. They had to learn how to prevent its being tipped\r\nover by the wind, and how to steer it in any direction. This took years\r\nof patient work. But the problem was conquered at last, and they\r\nattached a motor and propeller to the glider, and had an air-ship under\r\nperfect control and with the speed of an express-train. Their flyer of\r\n1905, which made a flight of twenty-four miles at a speed of more than\r\nthirty-eight miles an hour, carried a twenty-five-horse-power gasolene\r\nmotor, and weighed, with its load, 925 pounds. Figs. 94 and 95 show the\r\nWright air-ship in flight. Fig. 97 shows the mechanism.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 94--IN FULL FLIGHT]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n  Copyright, 1908, by Pictorial News Co.\r\nFIG. 95--WRIGHT AIR-SHIP IN FLIGHT\r\n  Rear view, showing propellers.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 97--THE SEAT AND MOTOR OF THE WRIGHT AEROPLANE\r\n  Photo by Pictorial News Co.]\r\n\r\n    How the Wright Aeroplane Is Kept Afloat\r\n\r\nThe Wright aeroplane is balanced by a warping or twisting of the planes\r\n1 and 2, which form the supporting surfaces (Fig. 96). If left to itself\r\nthe machine would tip over like a kite when the string is cut and drop\r\nedgewise to the ground. Suppose the side _R_ starts to fall. The corners\r\n_a_ and _e_ are raised by the operator while _b_ and _f_ are lowered,\r\nthus twisting the planes, as shown in the dotted lines of the figure.\r\nThe side _R_ then catches more wind than the side _L_. The wind exerts a\r\ngreater lifting force on _R_ than on _L_, and the balance is restored.\r\nThe twist is then taken out of the machine by the operator. A ship when\r\nsailing on an even keel presents true unwarped planes to the wind.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 96--HOW THE WRIGHT AIR-SHIP IS KEPT AFLOAT\r\n  This picture represents a glider. The motor-driven aeroplane is balanced\r\nby the warping of the planes in the same way as the glider.]\r\n\r\nThe twisting is brought about by a pull on the rope 3, which is attached\r\nat _d_ and _c_, and passes through pulleys at _g_ and _h_. When the rope\r\nis pulled toward the left the right end is tightened and slack is paid\r\nout at the left end. This pulls down the corner _d_, and raises _e_. The\r\ncorner _a_ is raised by the post which connects _a_ and _e_. The rope 4,\r\npassing from _a_ to _b_ through pulleys at _m_ and _n_, is thus drawn\r\ntoward _a_ and pulls down the corner _b_. Thus _a_ is raised and _b_ is\r\nlowered. At the same time rope 4 turns the rear rudder to the left, as\r\nshown by the dotted lines, thus forcing the side _R_ against the wind.\r\nOf course, if the left side of the machine starts to fall, the rope 3 is\r\npulled toward the right, and all the movements take place in the\r\nopposite direction. The ropes are connected to a lever, by which the\r\noperator controls the warping of the planes. These movements are\r\npossible because the joints are all universal, permitting movement in\r\nany direction. In whatever position the planes may be set, they are held\r\nperfectly rigid by the two ropes, together with others not shown in the\r\nfigure. The machine is guided up or down by the front horizontal rudder.\r\n\r\nWhen the aeroplane swings round a curve the outer wing is raised because\r\nit moves faster than the inner wing, and therefore has greater lifting\r\nforce. Thus the aeroplane banks its own curves.\r\n\r\nThe Wright flying-machine is called a biplane because it has two\r\nprincipal planes, one above the other. A number of successful\r\nflying-machines have been built with only one plane, and these are\r\ncalled monoplanes. A monoplane that early became famous is that of\r\nBlériot (Fig. 98). The Blériot monoplane was the first flying-machine to\r\ncross the English Channel. This machine is controlled by a single lever\r\nmounted with a ball-and-socket coupling, so that it can move in any\r\ndirection. When on the ground it is supported by three wheels like\r\nbicycle wheels, so that it does not require a track for starting, but\r\ncan start anywhere from level ground. The Wright and the Blériot\r\nrepresent the two leading types of early successful flying-machines.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n  Copyright by M. Brauger, Paris\r\nFIG. 98--THE BLÉRIOT MONOPLANE]\r\n\r\n    Submarines\r\n\r\nSuccessful navigation beneath the surface of the water, though not\r\ncarried to the extent imagined by Jules Verne, was a reality at the\r\nbeginning of the twentieth century. Instead of twenty thousand leagues\r\nunder the sea, less than a hundred leagues had been accomplished, but no\r\none can foretell what the future may have in store.\r\n\r\nThe principal use of the submarine is in war. It is a diving\r\ntorpedo-boat, and acts under cover of water, as the light artillery on\r\nland is secured behind intrenchments. The weapon used by the submarine\r\nis the torpedo. The torpedo is itself a small submarine able to propel\r\nitself, and if started in the water toward a certain object, to go under\r\nwater straight to the mark. It carries a heavy charge either of\r\nguncotton or dynamite, which explodes when the torpedo strikes a solid\r\nobject, such as a battle-ship. The first torpedo was intended to be\r\nsteered from the shore by means of long tiller-ropes, and to be\r\npropelled by a steam-engine or by clockwork. The Whitehead fish torpedo,\r\ninvented in 1866, is self-steering. At the head of the torpedo is a\r\npointed steel firing-pin. When the torpedo strikes a ship or any rigid\r\nobject this steel pin is driven against a detonator cap which is in the\r\ncentre of the charge of dynamite. The blow causes the cap to explode,\r\nand the explosion of the cap explodes the dynamite. The torpedo is so\r\narranged that it cannot explode until it is about thirty yards away from\r\nthe ship from which it is fired. The steel pin cannot strike the cap\r\nuntil a small \"collar\" has been revolved off by a propeller fan, and\r\nthis requires a distance of about thirty yards. The screw propeller is\r\ndriven by compressed air. A valve which is worked by the pressure of the\r\nwater keeps the torpedo at any depth for which the valve is set. The\r\ntorpedo contains many ingenious devices for bringing it quickly to the\r\nrequired depth and keeping it straight in its course. One of these\r\ndevices is the gyroscope, which will be described under the head of\r\n\"spinning tops.\" Whitehead torpedoes are capable of running at a speed\r\nof over thirty-seven miles an hour for a range of two thousand yards and\r\nhitting the mark aimed at almost as accurately as a gun. The submarine\r\nboat carries a number of torpedoes, and has one torpedo-tube near the\r\nforward end from which to fire the torpedoes.\r\n\r\nIt would be very difficult for one submarine to fight another submarine,\r\nfor the submarine when completely submerged is blind. It could not see\r\nin the water to find its enemy. The torpedo-boat-destroyer is able to\r\ndestroy a submarine by means of torpedoes, shells full of high\r\nexplosives, or quick-firing guns. Advantage must be taken of the moment\r\nwhen the submarine comes to the surface to get a view of her enemy.\r\n\r\nOne of the great enemies of the submarine will probably be the air-ship,\r\nfor while the submarine when under water cannot be seen from a ship on\r\nthe surface, it can, under favorable conditions, be seen from a certain\r\nheight in the air.\r\n\r\nMost submarines use a gasolene motor for surface travel, and an electric\r\nmotor run by a storage battery for navigation below the surface. The\r\nbest submarines can travel at the surface like an ordinary boat, or\r\n\"awash\"--that is, just below the surface--with only the conning tower\r\nprojecting above the water, or they can travel completely submerged.\r\n\r\nThe rising and sinking of the submarine depend on the principle of\r\nArchimedes. The upward push of the water is just equal to the weight of\r\nthe water displaced. If the water displaced weighs more than the boat,\r\nthen the upward push of the water is greater than the weight of the boat\r\nand the boat rises. However, the boat can be made to dive when its\r\nweight is just a little less than the weight of the water displaced.\r\nThis is done by means of horizontal rudders which may be inclined so as\r\nto cause the boat to glide downward as its propeller drives it forward.\r\n\r\nThe magnetic compass is not reliable in a submarine with a hull made of\r\nsteel. The electric motor used for propelling the boat under water also\r\ninterferes with the action of the compass, because of its magnetic\r\nfield. The gyroscope, which we shall describe later, is not affected by\r\nmagnetic action, and may take the place of the compass.\r\n\r\nWater ballast is used, and when the submarine wishes to dive, water is\r\nadmitted into the tanks until the boat is nearly heavy enough to sink of\r\nits own weight. It is then guided downward by the horizontal rudder. The\r\nsubmarine is driven by a screw propeller, and some submarines are\r\nlowered by means of a vertical screw. Just as a horizontal screw propels\r\na vessel forward, so a vertical screw will propel it downward. When the\r\nsubmarine wishes to rise, it may do so by the action of its rudder, or\r\nthe water may be pumped out of its tanks, when the water will raise it\r\nrapidly. A submarine which is kept always a little lighter than water\r\nwill rise to the surface in case of accident to its machinery. Figs. 99,\r\n100, and 101 are from photographs of United States submarines.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 99--THE \"PLUNGER\"\r\n  Photo by Pictorial News Co.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 100--U. S. SUBMARINE \"SHARK\" READY FOR A DIVE\r\n  Photo by Pictorial News Co.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 101--FIRST SUBMARINE CONSTRUCTED IN UNITED STATES.\r\nIT WENT TO THE BOTTOM WITH SEVEN MEN, WHO WERE DROWNED\r\n  Photo by Pictorial News Co.]\r\n\r\nThere is one kind of submarine built for peaceful pursuits which\r\ndeserves mention. It is the _Argonaut_, invented by Simon Lake. This\r\nremarkable boat crawls along the bottom of the sea, but not at a very\r\ngreat depth. It is equipped with divers' appliances, and is used in\r\nsaving wreckage. Divers can go out through the bottom of the boat, walk\r\nabout on the sea bottom, and when through with their work re-enter the\r\nboat; all the while boat and men are, perhaps, a hundred feet below the\r\nsurface. The divers' compartment, from which the divers go out into the\r\nwater, is separated by an air-tight partition from the rest of the boat.\r\nCompressed air is forced into this compartment until the pressure of the\r\nair equals the pressure of the water outside. Then the door in the\r\nbottom is opened, and the air keeps the water out. The men in their\r\ndiving-suits can then go out and in as they please.\r\n\r\nFor every boat there is a depth beyond which it must not go. The penalty\r\nfor going beyond this depth is a battered-in vessel, for the pressure\r\nincreases with the depth. Every time the depth is increased thirty-two\r\nfeet the pressure is increased fifteen pounds on every square inch.\r\nBeyond a certain depth the vessel cannot resist the pressure. Submarines\r\nhave been made strong enough to withstand the pressure at a depth of\r\nfive thousand feet, or nearly a mile. Most submarines, however, cannot\r\ngo deeper than a hundred and fifty feet.\r\n\r\nAir is supplied to the occupants of the boat either from reservoirs\r\ncontaining compressed air or oxygen, or by means of chemicals which\r\nabsorb the carbon dioxide produced in breathing and restore the needed\r\nquantity of oxygen to the air.\r\n\r\nWhile the men in the boat cannot see in the water, they can see objects\r\non the surface of the water, even when their boat is several feet below\r\nthe surface, by means of the periscope. This is an arrangement of lenses\r\nand mirrors in a tube bent in two right angles, which projects a short\r\ndistance above the surface and can be turned in any direction (Fig.\r\n102). Thus the boat, while itself nearly invisible, can have a clear\r\nview of the battle-ship which it is about to attack.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 102--HOW MEN IN A SUBMARINE SEE WHEN UNDER THE\r\nWATER]\r\n\r\n    Some Spinning Tops that Are Useful\r\n\r\nEvery one knows that a top will stand upright only when it is spinning.\r\nMost tops when spinning will stand very rough treatment without being\r\nupset. The whip-top will stand a severe lashing. Spin a top upright and\r\ngive it a knock. It will go round in a circle in a slanting position,\r\nand after a time will right itself. If the top is struck toward the\r\nsouth it will not bow toward the south but toward the east or west. In\r\nthrowing a quoit, the quoit must be given a spinning motion or the\r\nthrower cannot be certain how it will alight. A coin thrown up with a\r\nspinning motion will not turn over. The quoit and the coin are like the\r\ntop. They will not turn over easily when spinning. For the same reason a\r\nrifle bullet is set spinning by the spiral grooves in the bore of the\r\ngun, and it goes straight to its mark. With a smooth-bore gun that does\r\nnot set the bullet spinning the gunner cannot be sure of his aim.\r\n\r\nIt took a long time to discover that the spinning top is a useful\r\nmachine. It is useful because of its steady motion, because it is\r\ndifficult to turn over. It was discovered by Newton long ago that every\r\nmoving object tries to keep on in the direction in which it is moving. A\r\nmoving object always requires some force to change its direction. The\r\nspinning top is a beautiful illustration of this principle. The top that\r\nis most useful is the gyroscope top (Fig. 103). It is mounted on pivots\r\nso arranged that the top can turn in any direction within the frame that\r\nsupports it. If the top is set spinning one may turn the frame in any\r\ndirection, but the top does not change direction. The axis of the top\r\nwill point in the same direction all the while the top is spinning, no\r\nmatter how the supporting frame is moved about. The top will spin on a\r\nstring. If attached inside a box the box can be made to stand on one\r\ncorner while the top is spinning.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 103--A TOP THAT SPINS ON A STRING]\r\n\r\nThis top, which is so hard to upset, has been used in ships to prevent\r\nthe ship being rolled by the waves. A large fly-wheel is mounted in the\r\nmiddle of the vessel on a horizontal axle. A fly-wheel is only a large\r\ntop. It spins with a steady motion, and because of its larger size it is\r\nvery much harder to overturn than a toy top. The fly-wheel in the ship\r\nresists the rolling force of the waves and steadies the ship, so that\r\neven with high waves the rolling can scarcely be felt. The waves do not\r\nso readily break over the ship when thus steadied by the revolving\r\nwheel.\r\n\r\nThe gyroscope is also used in some forms of torpedo to give the torpedo\r\nsteady motion. By means of a spring released by a trigger the gyroscope\r\nwithin the torpedo is set spinning before the torpedo enters the water.\r\nThe gyroscope keeps its direction unchanged, and as the torpedo turns\r\none way or the other the gyroscope acts upon one or the other of two\r\nvalves connected with the compressed-air chambers from which the screws\r\nof the torpedo are driven. The air thus set free by the gyroscope drives\r\na piston-rod connected with a rudder in such a way as to right the\r\ntorpedo. The torpedo goes through the water with a slightly zigzag\r\nmotion, but never more than two feet out of the line in which it was\r\naimed.\r\n\r\n    The Monorail-Car\r\n\r\nAnother use of the gyroscope is in the monorail-car. To make a car run\r\non a single rail, with its weight above the rail, was impossible until\r\nthe use of the gyroscope was discovered. In the monorail-car invented by\r\nBrennan (Fig. 104) there are two gyroscopes, each weighing fifteen\r\nhundred pounds, driven at a speed of three thousand revolutions a minute\r\nby an electric motor. Each gyroscope wheel with its motor is mounted in\r\nan air-tight casing from which the air is pumped out. The wheel will run\r\nmuch more easily in a vacuum than in air, for the air offers very great\r\nresistance to its motion. The wheels are placed one on each side of the\r\ncar with their axles horizontal. When the car starts to fall the\r\nspinning gyroscopes right it much as a spinning top rights itself if\r\ntipped to one side by a blow. If the wind tips the car to the left the\r\ngyroscopes incline to the right until the car is again upright. If the\r\nload is heavier on the right side the car inclines itself toward the\r\nleft just as a man leans to the left when carrying a load on his right\r\nshoulder. In rounding a curve the car leans to the inside of the curve\r\njust as a bicycle rider does, and as a railway train is made to do by\r\nlaying the outer rail of the curve higher than the inner rail. Two\r\ngyroscopes spinning in opposite directions are necessary to keep the car\r\nfrom falling when rounding a curve.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 104--A CAR THAT RUNS ON ONE RAIL\r\n  Louis Brennan's full-size monorail.]\r\n\r\nThe gyroscope may be used in place of a compass. If it is set spinning\r\nin a north and south direction it will continue to spin in a north and\r\nsouth direction, no matter how the ship may turn. It is even more\r\nreliable than the compass, for it is not affected by magnetic action.\r\nPossibly some of the great inventions yet to be made will be new uses of\r\nthe spinning top.\r\n\r\n    Liquid Air and the Greatest Cold\r\n\r\nFor a long time after men had learned the use of the furnace and could\r\nproduce great heat, the greatest cold known was that of the\r\nmountain-top. Men wondered what would happen if air could be made colder\r\nthan the frost of winter, but knew not how to bring about such a result.\r\nThey wondered what things could be frozen that remain liquid or gaseous\r\neven in the cold of winter.\r\n\r\nThe first artificial cold was produced by a mixture of salt and ice,\r\nsuch as we now use in an ice-cream freezer. In time men learned other\r\nways of producing great cold and even to manufacture ice in large\r\nquantities.\r\n\r\nThe cold of liquid air is far greater than that of ice or even a\r\nfreezing mixture of salt and ice. Liquid air is simply air that is so\r\ncold that it becomes a liquid just as steam when cooled forms water.\r\nSteam has only to be cooled to the temperature of boiling water, while\r\nair must be cooled to 314 degrees below zero on the Fahrenheit scale.\r\n\r\nIf it were possible for us to live in such a climate, and the world were\r\ncooled to the temperature of liquid air, we should have a curious world.\r\nWatch-springs might be made out of pewter, bells of tin, and piano wires\r\nof solder, for these metals are made stronger by the extreme cold of\r\nliquid air. There would be no air to breathe. Oceans and rivers would be\r\nfrozen solid, and the air would form a liquid ocean about thirty-five\r\nfeet deep. This ocean of liquid air would be kept boiling a long time by\r\nthe heat of the ice beneath it, for ice is hot compared with liquid air.\r\nThe ice would cool as it gave up its heat to the liquid air and in time\r\nbecome as cold as the liquid air itself.\r\n\r\nLiquid air has been shipped thousands of miles in a double walled tin\r\ncan, the space between the two walls being filled with felt. The felt\r\nprotects the liquid air from the heat of the air without. The liquid air\r\nevaporates slowly, and escapes through a small opening at the top.\r\n\r\nProfessor Dewar, a successor of Faraday in the Royal Institution,\r\ninvented the Dewar bulb, by means of which the evaporation of the liquid\r\nair is prevented. This bulb is a double-walled flask. In the space\r\nbetween the two walls of the flask is a vacuum. Now a vacuum is the best\r\npossible protection against heat. If we were to take a bottle full of\r\nair and pump out from the bottle all except about a thousandth of a\r\nmillionth of the air it contained at first we should have such a vacuum\r\nas that of the Dewar bulb. With such a vacuum around it ice could be\r\nkept from melting for many days even in the hottest weather, for no heat\r\ncan go through a vacuum.\r\n\r\nBut the greatest cold is not the cold of liquid air. Liquid hydrogen is\r\nso cold that it freezes air. When a flask of liquid hydrogen is opened\r\nthere is a small snow-storm of frozen air in the mouth of the flask. But\r\neven this is not the greatest cold. The liquid hydrogen may be frozen,\r\nforming a hydrogen snow whose temperature is 435 degrees below zero.\r\nThis is nearly equal to the cold of the space beyond the earth's\r\natmosphere, which is the greatest possible cold.\r\n\r\n    The Electric Furnace and the Greatest Heat\r\n\r\nThe greatest heat that has yet been produced artificially is that of the\r\nelectric arc. The exact temperature of the electric arc is not known\r\nwith certainty. It is known, however, that the temperature of the\r\nhottest part of the arc is not less than 6500 degrees Fahrenheit. When\r\nwe compare this with the temperature of the hottest coal furnace, which\r\nis about 4000 degrees, we can very easily understand that something is\r\nlikely to happen at the temperature of the electric arc that could not\r\nhappen in an ordinary furnace.\r\n\r\nIf an electric arc is enclosed by something that will hold the heat in\r\nwe have an electric furnace, and any substance placed in the furnace may\r\nbe made nearly as hot as the arc itself. In the electric furnace any\r\nsubstance, whether found in nature or prepared artificially, may be\r\nmelted or vaporized.\r\n\r\nIt was Henri Moissan, Professor of Chemistry at the Sorbonne in Paris,\r\nwho made the first great discoveries in the use of the electric furnace\r\nand produced the first artificial diamonds. The study of diamonds led\r\nMoissan to believe that in nature they are formed by the cooling of a\r\nmelted mixture of iron and carbon. He could prepare such a mixture with\r\nhis electric furnace, he thought, and so make diamonds like those of the\r\ndiamond mines. So, with an electric furnace having electrodes as large\r\nas a man's wrist, a mixture of iron and charcoal in a carbon crucible,\r\nand a glass tank filled with water, Moissan set out to change the\r\ncharcoal to diamonds. At a temperature of more than six thousand degrees\r\nthe iron and charcoal were melted together. For a time of from three to\r\nsix minutes the mixture was in the intense heat. Then the covering of\r\nthe furnace was removed and the crucible with the melted mixture dropped\r\ninto the tank of water. With some fear this was done for the first time,\r\nfor it was not known what would happen when such a hot object was\r\ndropped into cold water. But no explosion occurred, only a violent\r\nboiling of the water, a fierce blazing of the molten mass, and then a\r\ngradual change of color from white to red and red to black. With boiling\r\nacids and other chemicals the refuse was removed, and the fragments that\r\nremained were found to be diamonds, small, it is true, so small that\r\nthey could be seen only with the aid of a microscope, but giving promise\r\nof greater things to come. The outer crust of iron held the melted\r\ncharcoal under enormous pressure while it slowly cooled and formed the\r\ndiamond crystals. The process of manufacturing diamonds is illustrated\r\nin Figs. 105, 106, and 107.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 105--MANUFACTURING DIAMONDS--FIRST OPERATION\r\n  Preparing the furnace. Charcoal and iron ore placed in a crucible and\r\nsubjected to enormous heat electrically.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 106--MANUFACTURING DIAMONDS--SECOND OPERATION\r\n  The furnace at work.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 107--MANUFACTURING DIAMONDS--THIRD OPERATION\r\n  Plunging the crucible into cold water. Observe the white-hot carbon\r\njust removed from the furnace.]\r\n\r\nThe electric furnace has made possible the preparation of substances\r\nunknown before, and the production in large quantities at low cost of\r\nsubstances that before were too costly for general use. One of the best\r\nknown of these substances is aluminum. With the discovery of the\r\nelectric-furnace method of extracting aluminum from its ores, the price\r\nof aluminum fell from one hundred and twenty-four dollars per pound to\r\ntwelve cents per pound.\r\n\r\nAmong the many uses of the electric furnace we may mention the\r\npreparation of calcium carbide, which is used in producing the acetylene\r\nlight; carborundum, a substance almost as hard as diamond; and\r\nphosphorus, which is used in making the phosphorus match. It is used\r\nalso to some extent in the manufacture of glass, and, in some cases, for\r\nextracting iron from its ores.\r\n\r\n    The Wireless Telegraph\r\n\r\nA ship in a fog is struck by another ship. The water rushes in, puts out\r\nthe fires in the boilers, the engines stop, the ship is helpless in\r\nmid-ocean in the darkness of the night. But the snapping of an electric\r\nspark is heard in one of the cabins. Soon another vessel steams\r\nalongside. The life-boats are lowered and every person is saved. The\r\ncall for help had gone out over the sea in every direction for two\r\nhundred miles. Another ship had caught the signal and hastened to the\r\nrescue, and the world realized that the wireless telegraph had robbed\r\nthe sea of its terrors.\r\n\r\nWithout the curious combination of magnets, wires, and batteries on the\r\nfirst ship no signal could have been sent, and without such a\r\ncombination on the second ship the signal would have passed unheeded.\r\nHow was this combination discovered, and how does it work?\r\n\r\nFaraday, as we have seen, discovered the principle of the\r\ninduction-coil. With the induction-coil a powerful electric spark can be\r\nproduced. The friction electrical machine was known long before the time\r\nof Faraday. Franklin proved that a stroke of lightning is like a spark\r\nfrom an electrical machine, only more powerful. These great discoverers\r\ndid not know, however, that an electric spark sends out something like\r\nlight which travels in all directions. They did not know it, because\r\nthey had no eyes to see this strange light.\r\n\r\nI will tell you a fable to make the meaning clear. There once lived a\r\nrace of blind men. Not one of them could see. They built houses and\r\ncities, railroads and steamships, but they did everything by touch and\r\nsound. When they met they touched each other and spoke, and each man\r\nknew his friend by the sound of his voice. One day a wise man among them\r\nsaid he believed there was something besides the sound of the voice with\r\nwhich they could make signals to each other. Another wise man thought\r\nupon this matter for some time and brought forth a proof that there is\r\nsomething called light, though no man could see it. Another, wiser and\r\nmore practical, invented an eye which any man could carry about with him\r\nand see the light when he turned it in the direction from which the\r\nlight was coming. Thereafter each man carried a light that flashed like\r\nthe flashing of a firefly. Each man also carried an eye, and each could\r\nsee his friend as well as hear the sound of his voice.\r\n\r\nThe fable is true. The light which no man had seen we now call electric\r\nwaves. The eye with which any one can perceive this light is the\r\nreceiving instrument of the wireless telegraph. The strange light\r\nflashed out whenever an electric spark passed from an electrical\r\nmachine, a Leyden jar, an induction-coil, or as lightning in the clouds,\r\nbut for hundreds of years this light was unseen. The human eye could not\r\nsee it, and no artificial eye that would catch electric waves had been\r\ninvented. A man in England, James Clerk-Maxwell, first proved that there\r\nis such a light. Heinrich Hertz, a German, first made an eye that would\r\ncatch the waves from the electric spark, and the man who first perfected\r\nan eye with which one could catch the electric waves at a great distance\r\nand improved the instruments for sending out such waves was Marconi.\r\n\r\nThe fable is true, for electric waves are like the light from the sun.\r\nThey go through space in all directions as light does. They will not\r\nmerely go through air, but through what we call empty space, or a\r\nvacuum, as light will. If we think of waves somewhat like water waves,\r\nbut not exactly like them, rushing through space, we have about as good\r\na picture of electric waves as we can well form in our minds. As the\r\nlight of a lamp goes out in all directions, so do the electric waves go\r\nout in all directions from the place where the electric spark passes.\r\nSince these waves go through what we call empty space, we must think of\r\nsomething in that space and that it is not really empty. Examine an\r\nincandescent electric lamp. The bulb was full of air when the carbon\r\nthread was placed in it. The air was then pumped out until only about a\r\nmillionth part remained. The bulb was then sealed at the tip and made\r\nair-tight. We say the space inside is a vacuum. If the bulb is broken\r\nthere is a loud report as the air rushes in. Is the bulb really empty\r\nafter the air is pumped out? Is anything left in the bulb around the\r\ncarbon thread? Turn on the electric current and the carbon thread\r\nbecomes white hot. The light from the white-hot carbon thread goes out\r\nthrough the vacuum. There is nothing in the vacuum that we can see or\r\nfeel or handle, but something must be there to carry the light from the\r\ncarbon thread. The light of the sun comes to the earth through\r\nninety-three million miles of space. Is there anything between the earth\r\nand the sun through which this light can pass? Light, we know, is made\r\nup of waves, and we cannot think of waves going through empty space.\r\nThere must be something between the sun and the earth. That something\r\nthrough which the light of the sun comes to the earth we call the ether.\r\nIt is the ether that carries the light across the vacuum in the light\r\nbulb as well as from the sun to the earth. Electric waves used in\r\nwireless telegraphy go through this same ether. The light of the sun is\r\nmade up of the same kind of waves, and we do not think it strange\r\nbecause it is so common. It is true we do not see light waves, but they\r\naffect our eyes so that by means of them we can see objects and perceive\r\nthe flashing of a light. So with the wireless receiving instrument we\r\ndo not see the electric waves, but we perceive the flashing of the\r\nstrange light. Electric waves and light travel with the same\r\nspeed--186,000 miles in a second. A wireless message will go around the\r\nearth in about one-seventh of a second.\r\n\r\nElectric waves will go through a brick wall as readily as sunlight will\r\ngo through a glass window, but that is not so strange as it may seem.\r\nRed light will not go through blue glass. Blue glass holds back the red\r\nlight, but lets the blue light go through. So the brick wall holds back\r\ncommon light, but allows the light which we call electric waves to go\r\nthrough.\r\n\r\nSome waves on water are longer than others. So electric waves are longer\r\nthan light waves. That is the only difference between them. In fact, the\r\nlight of the sun is made up of very short electric waves. These short\r\nwaves affect our eyes, but the longer electric waves do not. We are\r\ndaily receiving the wireless-telegraph waves from the sun, which we call\r\nlight. Electric waves used in wireless telegraphy vary from about six\r\nhundred feet to two miles in length, while the longest light waves that\r\naffect our eyes are only one thirty-three-thousandth of an inch in\r\nlength.\r\n\r\nThe sensitive part of the Marconi receiving apparatus is the coherer.\r\nThe first coherer was made in 1890 by Prof. Edward Branly, of the\r\nCatholic University of Paris. Very fine metal filings were enclosed in a\r\ntube of ebonite and connected in a circuit with a battery and a\r\ngalvanometer. The filings have so high a resistance that no current\r\nflows. The waves from an electric spark, however, affect the filings so\r\nthat they allow the current to flow. The electric waves are said to\r\ncause the filings to cohere--that is, to cling together more closely. It\r\nis a peculiar form of electric welding. Branly discovered that a slight\r\ntapping of the tube loosens the filings and stops the flow of the\r\ncurrent.\r\n\r\nAll that was needed for wireless telegraphy was at hand. Men knew how to\r\nproduce electric waves of any desired length. They knew how they would\r\nact. A sensitive receiver had been discovered. There was needed the\r\npractical man who should combine the parts, improve details, and apply\r\nthe wireless telegraph to actual use. This was the work of Guglielmo\r\nMarconi. In 1894, at the age of twenty, Marconi began his experiments on\r\nhis father's estate, the Villa Grifone, Bologna, Italy. Fig. 108 is from\r\na photograph of Marconi and his wireless sending and receiving\r\ninstruments.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 108--MARCONI AND HIS WIRELESS-TELEGRAPH SENDING AND\r\nRECEIVING INSTRUMENTS]\r\n\r\nTo Marconi, telegraphing through space without wires appears no more\r\nwonderful than telegraphing with wires. In the wire telegraph electric\r\nwaves, which we then call an electric current, follow a wire somewhat as\r\nthe sound of the voice goes through a speaking-tube. In the wireless\r\ntelegraph the electric waves go out through space without any wire to\r\nguide them. The light and heat waves of the sun travel to us through\r\nmillions of miles of space without requiring any conducting wire. That\r\nelectric waves should go though space in the same way that light does is\r\nno more wonderful than that the waves should follow all the turns of a\r\nwire.\r\n\r\nThe sending instrument used by Marconi includes an induction-coil, one\r\nside of the spark-gap being connected to the earth and the other to a\r\nvertical wire (Fig. 109). There must be a battery of Leyden jars in the\r\ncircuit of the secondary coil. The induction-coil may be operated by a\r\nstorage battery or dynamo. The vertical wire, or antenna, is to the\r\nsending instrument what the sounding-board is to a violin. It is needed\r\nto increase the strength of the waves. In the wireless telegraph some\r\nwires must be used. It is called wireless because the stations are not\r\nconnected by wires. The antenna for long-distance work consists of a\r\nnetwork of overhead wires. When the key is pressed a rapid succession of\r\nsparks passes across the spark-gap. The antenna, or overhead wire, is\r\nthus made to send out electric waves. By pressing the key for a longer\r\nor shorter time, a longer or shorter series of waves may be produced and\r\na correspondingly longer or shorter effect on the receiver. In this\r\nmanner the dots and dashes of the Morse alphabet may be transmitted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 109--DIAGRAM OF WIRELESS-TELEGRAPH SENDING\r\nAPPARATUS]\r\n\r\nAt the receiving station there are two circuits. One includes a coherer,\r\na local battery, and a telegraph relay (Fig. 110). The other circuit,\r\nwhich is opened and closed by the relay, includes a recording instrument\r\nand a tapper. One end of the coherer is connected to the earth and the\r\nother to a vertical wire like that used for the transmitter. The\r\nelectric waves weld the filings in the coherer, and this closes the\r\nfirst circuit. The relay then closes the second circuit, the recording\r\ninstrument records a dot or a dash, and the tapper strikes the coherer\r\nand breaks the filings apart ready for another stream of electric waves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 110--DIAGRAM OF MARCONI WIRELESS-TELEGRAPH RECEIVING\r\nAPPARATUS\r\n  The second circuit described in the text is not shown here. The relay\r\nand the second circuit would take the place of the electric bell. In the\r\ncircuit as shown here the electric waves would cause the coherer to\r\nclose the circuit and ring the bell.]\r\n\r\nWith this arrangement it was possible to work only two stations at one\r\ntime. Though stations were to be established in all the cities of Great\r\nBritain, only one message could be sent at one time, and all stations\r\nbut one must keep silence, because a second series of waves would mingle\r\nwith the first and confusion would result.\r\n\r\nMarconi's next effort was to make it possible to send any number of\r\nmessages at one time. This led to his system of tuning the sending and\r\nreceiving instruments. With this system the receiving instrument will\r\ntake a message only from a sending instrument with which it is in tune.\r\nIt is possible, therefore, for any number of wireless-telegraph stations\r\nto operate at the same time, the waves crossing one another in all\r\ndirections without interfering, each receiver responding to the waves\r\nintended for it. An ocean steamer can, with the tuned system, send one\r\nmessage and receive another from a different station at the same time.\r\n\r\nMarconi's ambition was to send a wireless message across the Atlantic.\r\nQuietly he made his preparation, building at Poldhu, Cornwall, England,\r\na more powerful transmitter than had yet been used. At noon on the 12th\r\nof December, 1901, he sat in a room of the old barracks on Signal Hill,\r\nnear St. Johns, Newfoundland, waiting for a signal from England. His\r\nassistants at the Poldhu station were to telegraph across the ocean the\r\nletter \"S\" at certain times each day. On the table was the receiving\r\napparatus, made very sensitive, and including a telephone receiver. A\r\nwire led out of the window to a huge kite, which the furious wind held\r\nfour hundred feet above him. One kite and a balloon used for supporting\r\nthe antenna had been carried out to sea. He held the telephone receiver\r\nto his ear for some time. The critical time had come for which he had\r\nworked for years, for which his three hundred patents had prepared the\r\nway, and for which his company had erected the costly power station at\r\nPoldhu. Calmly he listened, his face showing no sign of emotion.\r\nSuddenly there sounded the sharp click of the tapper as it struck the\r\ncoherer. After a short time Marconi handed the telephone receiver to his\r\nassistant. \"See if you can hear anything,\" he said. A moment later,\r\nfaintly and yet distinctly, came the three little clicks, the dots of\r\nthe letter \"S\" tapped out an instant before in England. Marconi's\r\nvictory was won.\r\n\r\nA flying-machine can be equipped with a wireless-telegraph outfit, so\r\nthat a man can telegraph while flying through the air. Two men are\r\nneeded, one to operate the flying-machine, the other to send the\r\ntelegraphic messages. This has been done with the Wright machine and\r\nwith some dirigible balloons. Of course, the wireless instruments on the\r\nflying-machine cannot be connected to the ground. Instead of the ground\r\nconnection there is a second antenna.--one antenna on each side of the\r\nspark-gap. While in the ordinary wireless instruments the discharge\r\nsurges back and forth between the antenna and the earth, in the\r\nflying-machine wireless the discharge surges back and forth between the\r\ntwo antennæ. In the Wright machine, when equipped for wireless\r\ntelegraphy, the two antennæ are placed one under the upper plane, the\r\nother under the lower plane of the flying-machine.\r\n\r\nMore power is required for the wireless than for the wire telegraph. In\r\nthe wire telegraph about one-hundredth horse-power is required to send a\r\nmessage one hundred and twenty miles. To send a message the same\r\ndistance with the wireless requires about ten horse-power, or a thousand\r\ntimes as much as with the wire telegraph. This is because in the\r\nwireless telegraph the waves go out in all directions, and much of the\r\npower is wasted. In the wire telegraph the electric waves are directed\r\nalong the wire and very little of the power is wasted. For the same\r\nreason a person's voice can be heard a long distance through a\r\nspeaking-tube. The speaking-tube guides the sound and prevents it from\r\nscattering somewhat as the wire guides the electric waves.\r\n\r\nThe overhead wires of a wireless-telegraph station send out a \"dark\"\r\nlight while a message is being sent. (See frontispiece.) Standing near\r\nthe station on a dark night one can see nothing, but can hear only the\r\nterrific snapping of the electric discharge. The camera, however, shows\r\nthat light goes out from the wires. It is light of shorter waves than\r\nany that the eye can perceive, but the sensitive film of the\r\nphotographic plate makes it known to us.\r\n\r\n    The Wireless Telephone\r\n\r\nIn sending a message by the wire telegraph the current flows over the\r\nline wire when the key is pressed. When the key is released the current\r\nstops. The circuit is made and broken for every dot or dash. This we may\r\ncall an interrupted current. Now we have seen that the attempt to invent\r\na wire telephone using an interrupted current failed. While one is\r\ntalking over the wire telephone a current (alternating) must be flowing\r\nover the line wire. The sound of the voice does not make and break the\r\ncircuit, but changes the strength of the current. This alternating\r\ncurrent is wonderfully sensitive. It can vary in the rate at which it\r\nalternates or the number of alternations per second to correspond to\r\nsound of every pitch. It varies in strength to correspond to all the\r\nvariations in the voice, and reproduces in the receiver not merely the\r\nwords that are spoken but the quality of the voice, so that the voice of\r\na friend can be recognized by telephone almost as well as if talking\r\nface to face.\r\n\r\nThe same things are true of the wireless telegraph and telephone.\r\nInstead of an electric current, let us say \"a stream of electric waves.\"\r\nThen we may say of the wireless everything that we have said of the wire\r\ntelegraph and telephone. In sending a message by wireless telegraph the\r\nstream of electric waves flows when the key is pressed and stops when\r\nthe key is released. We have an interrupted stream of electric waves.\r\nBut an interrupted stream of waves cannot be used for a wireless\r\ntelephone any more than an interrupted current can be used for a\r\nwire-telephone. There must be a constantly flowing stream of electric\r\nwaves, and these waves must be changed in strength and form by the sound\r\nof the voice. Fig. 111 shows a wireless-telephone receiver in which\r\nlight is used to carry the message. The light acts on the receiver in\r\nsuch a way as to reproduce the sound.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 111--RECEIVER OF BELL'S PHOTOPHONE\r\n  An early idea in wireless telephony.]\r\n\r\nIn the wireless-telegraph receiver the interrupted stream of electric\r\nwaves makes and breaks the circuit of an electric battery. The\r\nwireless-telephone receiver must not make and break a circuit, but it\r\nmust be sensitive to all the changes in the electric waves. One such\r\nreceiver is the audion, which we shall now describe.\r\n\r\nThe audion was invented by Dr. Lee de Forest. De Forest had taken the\r\ndegree of Doctor of Philosophy at Yale University, having written his\r\nthesis for that degree on the subject of electric waves. He then entered\r\nthe employ of the Western Electric Company in Chicago, and while in this\r\nposition worked at night in his room on experiments with electric waves.\r\n\r\nHere he found that a gas flame is sensitive to electric waves (Fig.\r\n112). If a gas flame is made part of the circuit of an electric\r\nbattery, which includes also an induction-coil connected to a telephone\r\nreceiver, then when a stream of electric waves comes along there is a\r\nclick in the receiver. The waves change the resistance of the flame, and\r\nso change the strength of the current. The flame is a simple audion. It\r\nis the heated gas in the flame that responds to the electric waves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 112--A GAS FLAME IS SENSITIVE TO ELECTRIC WAVES]\r\n\r\nIf instead of a gas flame an incandescent-light bulb is used having a\r\nmetal filament, and on either side of the filament a small strip of\r\nplatinum, a more sensitive receiver is obtained. This is the audion,\r\nwhich is the distinguishing feature of the De Forest wireless telegraph\r\nand wireless telephone. The metal filament is made white hot by the\r\ncurrent from a storage battery. The vacuum in the bulb is about the same\r\nas that of the ordinary incandescent electric light. A very small\r\nquantity of gas is therefore left in the bulb. The electrified particles\r\nof gas respond more freely to electric waves in this bulb than in the\r\ngas flame.\r\n\r\nThe De Forest wireless telephone was adopted for use in the United\r\nStates Navy shortly before the cruise around the world in 1908. Every\r\nship in the navy was equipped with the wireless telephone, enabling the\r\nAdmiral to talk with the officers of any vessel up to a distance of\r\nthirty-five miles. The wireless telephone in use on a battle-ship is\r\nshown in Fig. 113.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 113--CAPTAIN INGERSOLL ON BOARD THE U. S.\r\nBATTLE-SHIP \"CONNECTICUT\" USING THE WIRELESS TELEPHONE]\r\n\r\n    Wonders of the Alternating Current\r\n\r\nBefore the days of the electric current, men used the power of falling\r\nwater. The mill or factory using the water-power was placed beside the\r\nfall. The water turned a great wheel, to which was connected the\r\nmachinery of the mill, It was not until the invention of the dynamo and\r\nmotor that water-power could be used at a great distance. If a hundred\r\nyears ago a man had said that the time would come when a waterfall could\r\nturn the wheels of a mill a hundred miles away he would have been\r\nlaughed at. Yet this very thing has come to pass. Indeed, one waterfall\r\nmay turn the wheels of many factories, run street-cars, and light cities\r\nup to a distance of a hundred miles and even more. The power of the\r\nfalling water goes out over slender copper wires from a great dynamo\r\nnear the fall to the motors in the factories and street-cars.\r\n\r\nThe falling water of Niagara has about five million horse-power. About\r\nthe hundredth part of this power is now being used. The water, falling\r\nin a wheel-pit 141 feet deep, turns a great dynamo weighing 87,000\r\npounds with a speed of 250 turns per minute. A number of such dynamos\r\nare used supplying an alternating current at a pressure of 22,000 volts,\r\nthe current alternating or changing direction twenty-five times per\r\nsecond. Such a pressure is too high for the motors and electric lights,\r\nbut the current is carried at high pressure to the place where it is to\r\nbe used and there transformed to a current of low pressure. In carrying\r\na current over a long line, there is less loss if the current is carried\r\nat high pressure. With an alternating current this can be done and the\r\ncurrent changed by means of a transformer to a current of low pressure.\r\n\r\nA transformer is simply two coils of wire wound on an iron core. The\r\nsimplest transformer is the form used by Faraday when he discovered\r\nelectromagnetic induction. If instead of making and breaking a circuit\r\nthat flows only in one direction as Faraday did, we cause an alternating\r\ncurrent to flow through one of the coils, which we may call the primary,\r\neach time the current changes direction in the primary the magnetic\r\nfield is reversed--that is, the end of the coil which was the north pole\r\nbecomes the south pole. This rapidly changing magnetic field induces a\r\ncurrent in the secondary coil. Each time the magnetic field of the\r\nprimary coil is reversed the current in the secondary changes direction.\r\nThus an alternating current in the primary induces an alternating\r\ncurrent in the secondary. One of these coils is of fine wire, which is\r\nwound a great many times around the iron. The other is of coarser wire\r\nwound only a few times around the iron. Suppose the current is to be\r\nchanged from high pressure to low pressure. Then the high-pressure\r\ncurrent from the line is made to flow through the coil of many turns,\r\nand a current of low pressure is given out from the coil of few turns.\r\nBy changing the number of turns of wire in the coils we can make the\r\npressure whatever we please. If the pressure or voltage of the secondary\r\ncoil is less than that of the primary, we have a \"step-down\"\r\ntransformer. On the other hand, if we send the current from the line\r\nwire through the coil of few turns, then we get a higher voltage from\r\nthe secondary coil than that of the line wire, and we have a \"step-up\"\r\ntransformer. The Niagara current is \"stepped down\" from 22,000 volts to\r\n220 volts for use in motors.\r\n\r\nAn electric lamp may be lighted though not connected to any battery or\r\ndynamo, but connected only to a coil of wire (Fig. 114). More than this,\r\nthe coil may be insulated so that no current can enter it from any other\r\ncoil or wire, and yet the lamp can be lighted. This can be done only by\r\nmeans of an alternating current. If the coil to which the lamp is\r\nconnected is held in the magnetic field of an alternating current, then\r\nanother alternating current is induced in the coil, and this second\r\ncurrent flows through the lamp.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 114--INCANDESCENT ELECTRIC LAMP LIGHTED THOUGH NOT\r\nCONNECTED TO ANY BATTERY OR DYNAMO]\r\n\r\nWe have already learned that a changing magnetic field induces a current\r\nin a coil. Now the coil through which an alternating current is flowing\r\nhas a changing magnetic field all around it, and if the lamp-coil is\r\nbrought into this changing magnetic field an alternating current will\r\nflow through the coil and the lamp. The insulation on the lamp-coil does\r\nnot prevent the magnetic field from acting, though it does prevent a\r\ncurrent from entering the coil. The current is induced in the coil\r\nitself, and does not enter it from any outside source.\r\n\r\nThe transformer works in the same way, the only difference being that in\r\nthe transformer the two coils are on the same iron core. But in the\r\ntransformer the two coils are insulated so that no current can flow from\r\none coil to the other. When an alternating current and transformers are\r\nused, the current that lights the lamps in the houses or on the streets\r\nis not the current from the dynamo. It is a new current induced in the\r\nsecondary coil of the transformer by the magnetic field of the primary\r\ncoil.\r\n\r\nA peculiar transformer which produces an alternating current that\r\nchanges direction millions of times in a second has been made by Nikola\r\nTesla. This current will do many wonderful things which no ordinary\r\ncurrent will do. It will light a room or run a motor without connecting\r\nwires. It has produced an electric discharge sixty-five feet in length\r\n(Figs. 115 and 116). Though this current is caused to flow by a pressure\r\nof millions of volts, it may be taken with safety through the human\r\nbody. Strange as it may seem, the safety of this current is due to the\r\nhigh pressure and the rapidity with which it changes direction. While\r\nthe current used at Sing Sing in executing criminals has a pressure of\r\nabout twenty-five hundred volts, a current having a pressure of a\r\nmillion volts and alternating hundreds of thousands or millions of times\r\nper second is harmless; With such a current the human body may become a\r\n\"live wire,\" and an electric lamp to be lighted held in one hand while\r\nthe other hand grasps the wire from the transformer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 115--AN ELECTRIC DISCHARGE AT A PRESSURE OF\r\n12,000,000 VOLTS, A CURRENT OF 800 AMPERES IN THE SECONDARY COIL]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 116.--AN ELECTRIC DISCHARGE SIXTY-FIVE FEET IN\r\nLENGTH]\r\n\r\n    X-Rays and Radium\r\n\r\nA strange light which passes through the human body as readily as\r\nsunlight through a window was discovered by Prof. Wilhelm Konrad\r\nRoentgen, of the University of Würzburg. This light, which Professor\r\nRoentgen named X-rays, is given out when an electric discharge at high\r\npressure passes through a certain kind of glass tube from which the air\r\nhas been pumped out until there is a nearly perfect vacuum.\r\n\r\nX-rays were discovered by accident. Professor Roentgen was working at\r\nhis desk with one of the glass tubes when he was called to lunch. He\r\nlaid the tube with the electric discharge passing through it on a book.\r\nReturning from lunch he took a photographic plate-holder which was under\r\nthe book and made some outdoor exposures with his camera. On developing\r\nthe plates a picture of a key appeared on one of them. He was greatly\r\npuzzled at first, but after a search for the key found it between the\r\nleaves of the book. The strange light from the electric discharge in the\r\nglass tube had passed through the book and the hard-rubber slide of the\r\nplate-holder and made a shadow-picture of the key on the photographic\r\nplate. He tried the strange light in many ways, and found that it would\r\ngo through many objects. It would even go through the human body, so\r\nthat shadow-pictures of the bones and organs of the body could be\r\nobtained. In Fig. 117 is shown a physician using X-rays. Fig. 118 is an\r\nX-ray photograph of the eye.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 117--A PHYSICIAN EXAMINING THE BONES OF THE ARM BY\r\nMEANS OF X-RAYS]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 118--X-RAY PHOTOGRAPH OF THE EYE\r\n  The eye is above and to the left of the larger black circle. The smaller\r\nblack circle is a shot which has lodged back of the eye.]\r\n\r\nNot long after the discovery of X-rays it was discovered that light very\r\nmuch like the X-rays is given out by certain minerals. One of the most\r\ninteresting and the best known of these is radium. Radium gives out a\r\nlight somewhat like X-rays that will go through copper and other metals.\r\nIt does many other strange things. It gives out heat as well as light;\r\nso much heat, in fact, that it is always about five degrees warmer than\r\nthe air around it. It continues to give out heat at such a rate that a\r\npound of radium will melt a pound of ice every hour. It can probably\r\nkeep this up for at least a thousand years. If this heat could be used\r\nin running an engine, a hundred pounds of radium would run a\r\none-horse-power engine without stopping for many hundred years. The\r\npower of Niagara might be replaced by the power of radium if an engine\r\nthat could use this power were invented. Fig. 119 is from a photograph\r\nmade with radium.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 119--PHOTOGRAPH MADE WITH RADIUM\r\n  A purse containing a coin. The strange light from the radium goes\r\nthrough the purse and the slide of the plate-holder and makes a\r\nshadow-picture.]\r\n\r\nThe great inventor of the future may be able to use the heat of radium\r\nor some new power now unknown. We have seen how, through the toil of\r\nmany years and the labors of many men, the great inventions of our age\r\nhave come into being. It may be that we are now witnessing other great\r\ninventions in the making.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\n\r\n\r\nBRIEF NOTES ON IMPORTANT INVENTIONS\r\n\r\n\r\n             Aerial Navigation\r\n\r\n     First air balloon--Montgolfier Brothers, France, 1783.\r\n\r\n     First balloon ascension--Rozier, France, 1783.\r\n\r\n     First gas balloon--Charles, France, 1783.\r\n\r\n     First crossing of the English Channel in a balloon--Blanchard,\r\n     1785.\r\n\r\n     First successful dirigible balloon--La France, Renard and\r\n     Krebs, France, 1884.\r\n\r\n     First successful motor-driven aeroplane--Wright Brothers,\r\n     United States; date of patent, 1906.\r\n\r\n     First crossing of the English Channel by an aeroplane--Blériot,\r\n     1909.\r\n\r\n     First air-ship in regular passenger service--Count Zeppelin,\r\n     Germany, 1910.\r\n\r\n\r\n             Agriculture\r\n\r\n     Plough with cast-iron mold-board and iron shares--James Small,\r\n     Scotland, 1784.\r\n\r\n     Grain-threshing machine--Andrew Meikle, England, 1788.\r\n\r\n     McCormick reaper, first practical grain-harvesting\r\n     machine--Cyrus H.

It was taken up in 1889, by\r\n     Panhard and Levassor, of Paris, who began immediately the\r\n     construction of the motor-car.

He\r\n     supposed that electricity consists of two fluids which are\r\n     separated by friction, and which neutralize each other when\r\n     they combine. This theory was more fully set forth by Robert\r\n     Symmer.\r\n\r\n     Leyden jar--Discovered first by Von Kleist in 1745.
