The Use of Spies\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreface to the Project Gutenberg Etext\r\n\r\nWhen Lionel Giles began his translation of Sun Tzŭ’s _Art of War_, the\r\nwork was virtually unknown in Europe. Its introduction to Europe began\r\nin 1782 when a French Jesuit Father living in China, Joseph Amiot,\r\nacquired a copy of it, and translated it into French. It was not a good\r\ntranslation because, according to Dr. Giles, \"[I]t contains a great\r\ndeal that Sun Tzŭ did not write, and very little indeed of what he\r\ndid.\"\r\n\r\nThe first translation into English was published in 1905 in Tokyo by\r\nCapt. E. F. Calthrop, R.F.A. However, this translation is, in the words\r\nof Dr. Giles, \"excessively bad.\" He goes further in this criticism: \"It\r\nis not merely a question of downright blunders, from which none can\r\nhope to be wholly exempt. Omissions were frequent; hard passages were\r\nwillfully distorted or slurred over. Such offenses are less pardonable.\r\nThey would not be tolerated in any edition of a Latin or Greek classic,\r\nand a similar standard of honesty ought to be insisted upon in\r\ntranslations from Chinese.\" In 1908 a new edition of Capt. Calthrop’s\r\ntranslation was published in London. It was an improvement on the\r\nfirst—omissions filled up and numerous mistakes corrected—but new\r\nerrors were created in the process. Dr. Giles, in justifying his\r\ntranslation, wrote: \"It was not undertaken out of any inflated estimate\r\nof my own powers; but I could not help feeling that Sun Tzŭ deserved a\r\nbetter fate than had befallen him, and I knew that, at any rate, I\r\ncould hardly fail to improve on the work of my predecessors.\"\r\n\r\nClearly, Dr. Giles’ work established much of the groundwork for the\r\nwork of later translators who published their own editions. Of the\r\nlater editions of the _Art of War_ I have examined; two feature Giles’\r\nedited translation and notes, the other two present the same basic\r\ninformation from the ancient Chinese commentators found in the Giles\r\nedition. Of these four, Giles’ 1910 edition is the most scholarly and\r\npresents the reader an incredible amount of information concerning Sun\r\nTzŭ’s text, much more than any other translation.\r\n\r\nThe Giles’ edition of the _Art of War_, as stated above, was a\r\nscholarly work. Dr. Giles was a leading sinologue at the time and an\r\nassistant in the Department of Oriental Printed Books and Manuscripts\r\nin the British Museum. Apparently he wanted to produce a definitive\r\nedition, superior to anything else that existed and perhaps something\r\nthat would become a standard translation. It was the best translation\r\navailable for 50 years. But apparently there was not much interest in\r\nSun Tzŭ in English-speaking countries since it took the start of the\r\nSecond World War to renew interest in his work. Several people\r\npublished unsatisfactory English translations of Sun Tzŭ. In 1944, Dr.\r\nGiles’ translation was edited and published in the United States in a\r\nseries of military science books. But it wasn’t until 1963 that a good\r\nEnglish translation (by Samuel B. Griffith and still in print) was\r\npublished that was an equal to Giles’ translation. While this\r\ntranslation is more lucid than Dr. Giles’ translation, it lacks his\r\ncopious notes that make his so interesting.\r\n\r\nDr. Giles produced a work primarily intended for scholars of the\r\nChinese civilization and language. It contains the Chinese text of Sun\r\nTzŭ, the English translation, and voluminous notes along with numerous\r\nfootnotes. Unfortunately, some of his notes and footnotes contain\r\nChinese characters; some are completely Chinese. Thus, a conversion to\r\na Latin alphabet etext was difficult. I did the conversion in complete\r\nignorance of Chinese (except for what I learned while doing the\r\nconversion). Thus, I faced the difficult task of paraphrasing it while\r\nretaining as much of the important text as I could. Every paraphrase\r\nrepresents a loss; thus I did what I could to retain as much of the\r\ntext as possible. Because the 1910 text contains a Chinese concordance,\r\nI was able to transliterate proper names, books, and the like at the\r\nrisk of making the text more obscure. However, the text, on the whole,\r\nis quite satisfactory for the casual reader, a transformation made\r\npossible by conversion to an etext. However, I come away from this task\r\nwith the feeling of loss because I know that someone with a background\r\nin Chinese can do a better job than I did; any such attempt would be\r\nwelcomed.\r\n\r\nBob Sutton\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreface by Lionel Giles\r\n\r\nThe seventh volume of _Mémoires concernant l’histoire, les sciences,\r\nles arts, les mœurs, les usages, &c., des Chinois_ is devoted to the\r\nArt of War, and contains, amongst other treatises, “Les Treize Articles\r\nde Sun-tse,” translated from the Chinese by a Jesuit Father, Joseph\r\nAmiot. Père Amiot appears to have enjoyed no small reputation as a\r\nsinologue in his day, and the field of his labours was certainly\r\nextensive. But his so-called translation of the Sun Tzŭ, if placed side\r\nby side with the original, is seen at once to be little better than an\r\nimposture. It contains a great deal that Sun Tzŭ did not write, and\r\nvery little indeed of what he did. Here is a fair specimen, taken from\r\nthe opening sentences of chapter 5:—\r\n\r\n_De l’habileté dans le gouvernement des Troupes._ Sun-tse dit : Ayez\r\nles noms de tous les Officiers tant généraux que subalternes;\r\ninscrivez-les dans un catalogue à part, avec la note des talents & de\r\nla capacité de chacun d’eux, afin de pouvoir les employer avec avantage\r\nlorsque l’occasion en sera venue. Faites en sorte que tous ceux que\r\nvous devez commander soient persuadés que votre principale attention\r\nest de les préserver de tout dommage. Les troupes que vous ferez\r\navancer contre l’ennemi doivent être comme des pierres que vous\r\nlanceriez contre des œufs. De vous à l’ennemi il ne doit y avoir\r\nd’autre différence que celle du fort au faible, du vide au plein.\r\nAttaquez à découvert, mais soyez vainqueur en secret. Voilà en peu de\r\nmots en quoi consiste l’habileté & toute la perfection même du\r\ngouvernement des troupes.\r\n\r\n\r\nThroughout the nineteenth century, which saw a wonderful development in\r\nthe study of Chinese literature, no translator ventured to tackle Sun\r\nTzŭ, although his work was known to be highly valued in China as by far\r\nthe oldest and best compendium of military science. It was not until\r\nthe year 1905 that the first English translation, by Capt. E.F.\r\nCalthrop. R.F.A., appeared at Tokyo under the title “Sonshi”(the\r\nJapanese form of Sun Tzŭ). Unfortunately, it was evident that the\r\ntranslator’s knowledge of Chinese was far too scanty to fit him to\r\ngrapple with the manifold difficulties of Sun Tzŭ. He himself plainly\r\nacknowledges that without the aid of two Japanese gentlemen “the\r\naccompanying translation would have been impossible.” We can only\r\nwonder, then, that with their help it should have been so excessively\r\nbad. It is not merely a question of downright blunders, from which none\r\ncan hope to be wholly exempt. Omissions were frequent; hard passages\r\nwere wilfully distorted or slurred over. Such offences are less\r\npardonable. They would not be tolerated in any edition of a Greek or\r\nLatin classic, and a similar standard of honesty ought to be insisted\r\nupon in translations from Chinese.\r\n\r\nFrom blemishes of this nature, at least, I believe that the present\r\ntranslation is free. It was not undertaken out of any inflated estimate\r\nof my own powers; but I could not help feeling that Sun Tzŭ deserved a\r\nbetter fate than had befallen him, and I knew that, at any rate, I\r\ncould hardly fail to improve on the work of my predecessors. Towards\r\nthe end of 1908, a new and revised edition of Capt. Calthrop’s\r\ntranslation was published in London, this time, however, without any\r\nallusion to his Japanese collaborators. My first three chapters were\r\nthen already in the printer’s hands, so that the criticisms of Capt.\r\nCalthrop therein contained must be understood as referring to his\r\nearlier edition. This is on the whole an improvement on the other,\r\nthought there still remains much that cannot pass muster. Some of the\r\ngrosser blunders have been rectified and lacunae filled up, but on the\r\nother hand a certain number of new mistakes appear. The very first\r\nsentence of the introduction is startlingly inaccurate; and later on,\r\nwhile mention is made of “an army of Japanese commentators” on Sun Tzŭ\r\n(who are these, by the way?), not a word is vouchsafed about the\r\nChinese commentators, who nevertheless, I venture to assert, form a\r\nmuch more numerous and infinitely more important “army.”\r\n\r\nA few special features of the present volume may now be noticed. In the\r\nfirst place, the text has been cut up into numbered paragraphs, both in\r\norder to facilitate cross-reference and for the convenience of students\r\ngenerally. The division follows broadly that of Sun Hsing-yen’s\r\nedition; but I have sometimes found it desirable to join two or more of\r\nhis paragraphs into one. In quoting from other works, Chinese writers\r\nseldom give more than the bare title by way of reference, and the task\r\nof research is apt to be seriously hampered in consequence. With a view\r\nto obviating this difficulty so far as Sun Tzŭ is concerned, I have\r\nalso appended a complete concordance of Chinese characters, following\r\nin this the admirable example of Legge, though an alphabetical\r\narrangement has been preferred to the distribution under radicals which\r\nhe adopted. Another feature borrowed from “The Chinese Classics” is the\r\nprinting of text, translation and notes on the same page; the notes,\r\nhowever, are inserted, according to the Chinese method, immediately\r\nafter the passages to which they refer. From the mass of native\r\ncommentary my aim has been to extract the cream only, adding the\r\nChinese text here and there when it seemed to present points of\r\nliterary interest. Though constituting in itself an important branch of\r\nChinese literature, very little commentary of this kind has hitherto\r\nbeen made directly accessible by translation.\r\n\r\nI may say in conclusion that, owing to the printing off of my sheets as\r\nthey were completed, the work has not had the benefit of a final\r\nrevision. On a review of the whole, without modifying the substance of\r\nmy criticisms, I might have been inclined in a few instances to temper\r\ntheir asperity. Having chosen to wield a bludgeon, however, I shall not\r\ncry out if in return I am visited with more than a rap over the\r\nknuckles. Indeed, I have been at some pains to put a sword into the\r\nhands of future opponents by scrupulously giving either text or\r\nreference for every passage translated. A scathing review, even from\r\nthe pen of the Shanghai critic who despises “mere translations,” would\r\nnot, I must confess, be altogether unwelcome. For, after all, the worst\r\nfate I shall have to dread is that which befell the ingenious paradoxes\r\nof George in _The Vicar of Wakefield_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nSun Wu and his Book\r\n\r\nSsu-ma Ch’ien gives the following biography of Sun Tzŭ: [1]\r\n\r\n\r\nSun Tzŭ Wu was a native of the Ch’i State. His _Art of War_ brought him\r\nto the notice of Ho Lu, [2] King of Wu. Ho Lu said to him:\r\n\r\n\"I have carefully perused your 13 chapters. May I submit your theory of\r\nmanaging soldiers to a slight test?\"\r\n\r\nSun Tzŭ replied: \"You may.\"\r\n\r\nHo Lu asked: \"May the test be applied to women?\"\r\n\r\nThe answer was again in the affirmative, so arrangements were made to\r\nbring 180 ladies out of the Palace. Sun Tzŭ divided them into two\r\ncompanies, and placed one of the King’s favourite concubines at the head\r\nof each. He then bade them all take spears in their hands, and\r\naddressed them thus: \"I presume you know the difference between front\r\nand back, right hand and left hand?\"\r\n\r\nThe girls replied: Yes.\r\n\r\nSun Tzŭ went on: \"When I say \"Eyes front,\" you must look straight\r\nahead. When I say \"Left turn,\" you must face towards your left hand.\r\nWhen I say \"Right turn,\" you must face towards your right hand. When I\r\nsay \"About turn,\" you must face right round towards your back.\"\r\n\r\nAgain the girls assented. The words of command having been thus\r\nexplained, he set up the halberds and battle-axes in order to begin the\r\ndrill. Then, to the sound of drums, he gave the order \"Right turn.\" But\r\nthe girls only burst out laughing. Sun Tzŭ said: \"If words of command\r\nare not clear and distinct, if orders are not thoroughly understood,\r\nthen the general is to blame.\"\r\n\r\nSo he started drilling them again, and this time gave the order \"Left\r\nturn,\" whereupon the girls once more burst into fits of laughter. Sun\r\nTzŭ: \"If words of command are not clear and distinct, if orders are not\r\nthoroughly understood, the general is to blame. But if his orders _are_\r\nclear, and the soldiers nevertheless disobey, then it is the fault of\r\ntheir officers.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, he ordered the leaders of the two companies to be beheaded.\r\nNow the king of Wu was watching the scene from the top of a raised\r\npavilion; and when he saw that his favourite concubines were about to be\r\nexecuted, he was greatly alarmed and hurriedly sent down the following\r\nmessage: \"We are now quite satisfied as to our general’s ability to\r\nhandle troops. If we are bereft of these two concubines, our meat and\r\ndrink will lose their savor. It is our wish that they shall not be\r\nbeheaded.\"\r\n\r\nSun Tzŭ replied: \"Having once received His Majesty’s commission to be\r\nthe general of his forces, there are certain commands of His Majesty\r\nwhich, acting in that capacity, I am unable to accept.\"\r\n\r\nAccordingly, he had the two leaders beheaded, and straightway installed\r\nthe pair next in order as leaders in their place. When this had been\r\ndone, the drum was sounded for the drill once more; and the girls went\r\nthrough all the evolutions, turning to the right or to the left,\r\nmarching ahead or wheeling back, kneeling or standing, with perfect\r\naccuracy and precision, not venturing to utter a sound. Then Sun Tzŭ\r\nsent a messenger to the King saying: \"Your soldiers, Sire, are now\r\nproperly drilled and disciplined, and ready for your majesty’s\r\ninspection. They can be put to any use that their sovereign may desire;\r\nbid them go through fire and water, and they will not disobey.\"\r\n\r\nBut the King replied: \"Let our general cease drilling and return to\r\ncamp. As for us, We have no wish to come down and inspect the troops.\"\r\n\r\nThereupon Sun Tzŭ said: \"The King is only fond of words, and cannot\r\ntranslate them into deeds.\"\r\n\r\nAfter that, Ho Lu saw that Sun Tzŭ was one who knew how to handle an\r\narmy, and finally appointed him general. In the west, he defeated the\r\nCh’u State and forced his way into Ying, the capital; to the north he\r\nput fear into the States of Ch’i and Chin, and spread his fame abroad\r\namongst the feudal princes. And Sun Tzŭ shared in the might of the\r\nKing.\r\n\r\nAbout Sun Tzŭ himself this is all that Ssu-ma Ch’ien has to tell us in\r\nthis chapter. But he proceeds to give a biography of his descendant,\r\nSun Pin, born about a hundred years after his famous ancestor’s death,\r\nand also the outstanding military genius of his time. The historian\r\nspeaks of him too as Sun Tzŭ, and in his preface we read: \"Sun Tzŭ had\r\nhis feet cut off and yet continued to discuss the art of war.\" [3] It\r\nseems likely, then, that \"Pin\" was a nickname bestowed on him after his\r\nmutilation, unless the story was invented in order to account for the\r\nname. The crowning incident of his career, the crushing defeat of his\r\ntreacherous rival P’ang Chuan, will be found briefly related in Chapter\r\nV. § 19, note.\r\n\r\nTo return to the elder Sun Tzŭ. He is mentioned in two other passages\r\nof the _Shih Chi:_—\r\n\r\nIn the third year of his reign [512 B.C.] Ho Lu, king of Wu, took the\r\nfield with Tzŭ-hsu [i.e. Wu Yuan] and Po P’ei, and attacked Ch’u. He\r\ncaptured the town of Shu and slew the two prince’s sons who had\r\nformerly been generals of Wu. He was then meditating a descent on Ying\r\n[the capital]; but the general Sun Wu said: \"The army is exhausted. It\r\nis not yet possible. We must wait\"…. [After further successful\r\nfighting,] \"in the ninth year [506 B.C.], King Ho Lu addressed Wu\r\nTzŭ-hsu and Sun Wu, saying: \"Formerly, you declared that it was not yet\r\npossible for us to enter Ying. Is the time ripe now?\" The two men\r\nreplied: \"Ch’u’s general Tzŭ-ch’ang, [4] is grasping and covetous, and\r\nthe princes of T’ang and Ts’ai both have a grudge against him. If Your\r\nMajesty has resolved to make a grand attack, you must win over T’ang\r\nand Ts’ai, and then you may succeed.\" Ho Lu followed this advice, [beat\r\nCh’u in five pitched battles and marched into Ying.] [5]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the latest date at which anything is recorded of Sun Wu. He\r\ndoes not appear to have survived his patron, who died from the effects\r\nof a wound in 496. In another chapter there occurs this passage:[6]\r\n\r\nFrom this time onward, a number of famous soldiers arose, one after the\r\nother: Kao-fan, [7] who was employed by the Chin State; Wang-tzu, [8]\r\nin the service of Ch’i; and Sun Wu, in the service of Wu. These men\r\ndeveloped and threw light upon the principles of war.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is obvious enough that Ssu-ma Ch’ien at least had no doubt about the\r\nreality of Sun Wu as an historical personage; and with one exception,\r\nto be noticed presently, he is by far the most important authority on\r\nthe period in question. It will not be necessary, therefore, to say\r\nmuch of such a work as the _Wu Yüeh Ch’un Ch’iu_, which is supposed to\r\nhave been written by Chao Yeh of the 1st century A.D. The attribution\r\nis somewhat doubtful; but even if it were otherwise, his account would\r\nbe of little value, based as it is on the _Shih Chi_ and expanded with\r\nromantic details. The story of Sun Tzŭ will be found, for what it is\r\nworth, in chapter 2. The only new points in it worth noting are: (1)\r\nSun Tzŭ was first recommended to Ho Lu by Wu Tzŭ-hsu. (2) He is called\r\na native of Wu. (3) He had previously lived a retired life, and his\r\ncontemporaries were unaware of his ability.\r\n\r\nThe following passage occurs in the Huai-nan Tzŭ: \"When sovereign and\r\nministers show perversity of mind, it is impossible even for a Sun Tzŭ\r\nto encounter the foe.\" Assuming that this work is genuine (and hitherto\r\nno doubt has been cast upon it), we have here the earliest direct\r\nreference for Sun Tzŭ, for Huai-nan Tzŭ died in 122 B.C., many years\r\nbefore the _Shih Chi_ was given to the world.\r\n\r\nLiu Hsiang (80-9 B.C.) says: \"The reason why Sun Tzŭ at the head of\r\n30,000 men beat Ch’u with 200,000 is that the latter were\r\nundisciplined.\"\r\n\r\nTeng Ming-shih informs us that the surname \"Sun\" was bestowed on Sun\r\nWu’s grandfather by Duke Ching of Ch’i [547-490 B.C.]. Sun Wu’s father\r\nSun P’ing, rose to be a Minister of State in Ch’i, and Sun Wu himself,\r\nwhose style was Ch’ang-ch’ing, fled to Wu on account of the rebellion\r\nwhich was being fomented by the kindred of T’ien Pao. He had three\r\nsons, of whom the second, named Ming, was the father of Sun Pin.\r\nAccording to this account then, Pin was the grandson of Wu, which,\r\nconsidering that Sun Pin’s victory over Wei was gained in 341 B.C., may\r\nbe dismissed as chronologically impossible. Whence these data were\r\nobtained by Teng Ming-shih I do not know, but of course no reliance\r\nwhatever can be placed in them.\r\n\r\nAn interesting document which has survived from the close of the Han\r\nperiod is the short preface written by the Great Ts’ao Ts’ao, or Wei Wu\r\nTi, for his edition of Sun Tzŭ. I shall give it in full:—\r\n\r\n\r\nI have heard that the ancients used bows and arrows to their advantage.\r\n[10] The _Lun Yu_ says: “There must be a sufficiency of military\r\nstrength.” The _Shu Ching_ mentions \"the army\" among the \"eight objects\r\nof government.\" The _I Ching_ says: \"‘army’ indicates firmness and\r\njustice; the experienced leader will have good fortune.\" The _Shih\r\nChing_ says: \"The King rose majestic in his wrath, and he marshalled his\r\ntroops.\" The Yellow Emperor, T’ang the Completer and Wu Wang all used\r\nspears and battle-axes in order to succour their generation. The _Ssu-ma\r\nFa_ says: \"If one man slay another of set purpose, he himself may\r\nrightfully be slain.\" He who relies solely on warlike measures shall be\r\nexterminated; he who relies solely on peaceful measures shall perish.\r\nInstances of this are Fu Ch’ai [11] on the one hand and Yen Wang on the\r\nother. [12] In military matters, the Sage’s rule is normally to keep\r\nthe peace, and to move his forces only when occasion requires. He will\r\nnot use armed force unless driven to it by necessity.\r\n\r\nMany books have I read on the subject of war and fighting; but the work\r\ncomposed by Sun Wu is the profoundest of them all. [Sun Tzŭ was a\r\nnative of the Ch’i state, his personal name was Wu. He wrote the _Art\r\nof War_ in 13 chapters for Ho Lu, King of Wu. Its principles were\r\ntested on women, and he was subsequently made a general. He led an army\r\nwestwards, crushed the Ch’u state and entered Ying the capital. In the\r\nnorth, he kept Ch’i and Chin in awe. A hundred years and more after his\r\ntime, Sun Pin lived. He was a descendant of Wu.] [13] In his treatment\r\nof deliberation and planning, the importance of rapidity in taking the\r\nfield, [14] clearness of conception, and depth of design, Sun Tzŭ\r\nstands beyond the reach of carping criticism. My contemporaries,\r\nhowever, have failed to grasp the full meaning of his instructions, and\r\nwhile putting into practice the smaller details in which his work\r\nabounds, they have overlooked its essential purport. That is the motive\r\nwhich has led me to outline a rough explanation of the whole.\r\n\r\nOne thing to be noticed in the above is the explicit statement that the\r\n13 chapters were specially composed for King Ho Lu. This is supported\r\nby the internal evidence of I. § 15, in which it seems clear that some\r\nruler is addressed.\r\n\r\nIn the bibliographic section of the _Han Shu_, there is an entry which\r\nhas given rise to much discussion: \"The works of Sun Tzŭ of Wu in 82\r\n_p’ien_ (or chapters), with diagrams in 9 _chuan_.\" It is evident that\r\nthis cannot be merely the 13 chapters known to Ssu-ma Ch’ien, or those\r\nwe possess today. Chang Shou-chieh refers to an edition of Sun Tzŭ’s\r\n_Art of War_ of which the \"13 chapters\" formed the first _chuan_,\r\nadding that there were two other _chuan_ besides. This has brought\r\nforth a theory, that the bulk of these 82 chapters consisted of other\r\nwritings of Sun Tzŭ—we should call them apocryphal—similar to the _Wen\r\nTa_, of which a specimen dealing with the Nine Situations [15] is\r\npreserved in the _T’ung Tien_, and another in Ho Shin’s commentary. It\r\nis suggested that before his interview with Ho Lu, Sun Tzŭ had only\r\nwritten the 13 chapters, but afterwards composed a sort of exegesis in\r\nthe form of question and answer between himself and the King. Pi\r\nI-hsun, the author of the _Sun Tzŭ Hsu Lu_, backs this up with a\r\nquotation from the _Wu Yüeh Ch’un Ch’iu:_ \"The King of Wu summoned Sun\r\nTzŭ, and asked him questions about the art of war. Each time he set\r\nforth a chapter of his work, the King could not find words enough to\r\npraise him.\" As he points out, if the whole work was expounded on the\r\nsame scale as in the above-mentioned fragments, the total number of\r\nchapters could not fail to be considerable. Then the numerous other\r\ntreatises attributed to Sun Tzŭ might be included. The fact that the\r\n_Han Chih_ mentions no work of Sun Tzŭ except the 82 _p’ien_, whereas\r\nthe Sui and T’ang bibliographies give the titles of others in addition\r\nto the \"13 chapters,\" is good proof, Pi I-hsun thinks, that all of\r\nthese were contained in the 82 _p’ien_. Without pinning our faith to\r\nthe accuracy of details supplied by the _Wu Yüeh Ch’un Ch’iu_, or\r\nadmitting the genuineness of any of the treatises cited by Pi I-hsun,\r\nwe may see in this theory a probable solution of the mystery. Between\r\nSsu-ma Ch’ien and Pan Ku there was plenty of time for a luxuriant crop\r\nof forgeries to have grown up under the magic name of Sun Tzŭ, and the\r\n82 _p’ien_ may very well represent a collected edition of these lumped\r\ntogether with the original work. It is also possible, though less\r\nlikely, that some of them existed in the time of the earlier historian\r\nand were purposely ignored by him. [16]\r\n\r\nTu Mu’s conjecture seems to be based on a passage which states: \"Wei Wu\r\nTi strung together Sun Wu’s _Art of War_,\" which in turn may have\r\nresulted from a misunderstanding of the final words of Ts’ao King’s\r\npreface. This, as Sun Hsing-yen points out, is only a modest way of\r\nsaying that he made an explanatory paraphrase, or in other words, wrote\r\na commentary on it. On the whole, this theory has met with very little\r\nacceptance. Thus, the _Ssu K’u Ch’uan Shu_ says: \"The mention of the 13\r\nchapters in the _Shih Chi_ shows that they were in existence before the\r\n_Han Chih_, and that latter accretions are not to be considered part of\r\nthe original work. Tu Mu’s assertion can certainly not be taken as\r\nproof.\"\r\n\r\nThere is every reason to suppose, then, that the 13 chapters existed in\r\nthe time of Ssu-ma Ch’ien practically as we have them now. That the\r\nwork was then well known he tells us in so many words. \"Sun Tzŭ’s _13\r\nChapters_ and Wu Ch’i’s _Art of War_ are the two books that people\r\ncommonly refer to on the subject of military matters. Both of them are\r\nwidely distributed, so I will not discuss them here.\" But as we go\r\nfurther back, serious difficulties begin to arise. The salient fact\r\nwhich has to be faced is that the _Tso Chuan_, the greatest\r\ncontemporary record, makes no mention whatsoever of Sun Wu, either as a\r\ngeneral or as a writer. It is natural, in view of this awkward\r\ncircumstance, that many scholars should not only cast doubt on the\r\nstory of Sun Wu as given in the _Shih Chi_, but even show themselves\r\nfrankly skeptical as to the existence of the man at all. The most\r\npowerful presentment of this side of the case is to be found in the\r\nfollowing disposition by Yeh Shui-hsin: [17]—\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is stated in Ssu-ma Ch’ien’s history that Sun Wu was a native of the\r\nCh’i State, and employed by Wu; and that in the reign of Ho Lu he\r\ncrushed Ch’u, entered Ying, and was a great general. But in Tso’s\r\nCommentary no Sun Wu appears at all. It is true that Tso’s Commentary\r\nneed not contain absolutely everything that other histories contain.\r\nBut Tso has not omitted to mention vulgar plebeians and hireling\r\nruffians such as Ying K’ao-shu, [18] Ts’ao Kuei, [19], Chu Chih-wu and\r\nChuan She-chu [20]. In the case of Sun Wu, whose fame and achievements\r\nwere so brilliant, the omission is much more glaring. Again, details\r\nare given, in their due order, about his contemporaries Wu Yuan and the\r\nMinister P’ei. [21] Is it credible that Sun Wu alone should have been\r\npassed over?\r\n\r\nIn point of literary style, Sun Tzŭ’s work belongs to the same school\r\nas _Kuan Tzŭ_, [22] _Liu T’ao_, [23] and the _Yüeh Yu_ [24] and may\r\nhave been the production of some private scholar living towards the end\r\nof the \"Spring and Autumn\" or the beginning of the \"Warring States\"\r\nperiod. [25] The story that his precepts were actually applied by the\r\nWu State, is merely the outcome of big talk on the part of his\r\nfollowers.\r\n\r\nFrom the flourishing period of the Chou dynasty [26] down to the time\r\nof the \"Spring and Autumn,\" all military commanders were statesmen as\r\nwell, and the class of professional generals, for conducting external\r\ncampaigns, did not then exist. It was not until the period of the \"Six\r\nStates\" [27] that this custom changed. Now although Wu was an\r\nuncivilized State, it is conceivable that Tso should have left\r\nunrecorded the fact that Sun Wu was a great general and yet held no\r\ncivil office? What we are told, therefore, about Jang-chu [28] and Sun\r\nWu, is not authentic matter, but the reckless fabrication of theorizing\r\npundits. The story of Ho Lu’s experiment on the women, in particular,\r\nis utterly preposterous and incredible.\r\n\r\nYeh Shui-hsin represents Ssu-ma Ch’ien as having said that Sun Wu\r\ncrushed Ch’u and entered Ying. This is not quite correct. No doubt the\r\nimpression left on the reader’s mind is that he at least shared in\r\nthese exploits. The fact may or may not be significant; but it is\r\nnowhere explicitly stated in the _Shih Chi_ either that Sun Tzŭ was\r\ngeneral on the occasion of the taking of Ying, or that he even went\r\nthere at all. Moreover, as we know that Wu Yuan and Po P’ei both took\r\npart in the expedition, and also that its success was largely due to\r\nthe dash and enterprise of Fu Kai, Ho Lu’s younger brother, it is not\r\neasy to see how yet another general could have played a very prominent\r\npart in the same campaign.\r\n\r\nCh’en Chen-sun of the Sung dynasty has the note:—\r\n\r\nMilitary writers look upon Sun Wu as the father of their art. But the\r\nfact that he does not appear in the _Tso Chuan_, although he is said to\r\nhave served under Ho Lu King of Wu, makes it uncertain what period he\r\nreally belonged to.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe also says:—\r\n\r\nThe works of Sun Wu and Wu Ch’i may be of genuine antiquity.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is noticeable that both Yeh Shui-hsin and Ch’en Chen-sun, while\r\nrejecting the personality of Sun Wu as he figures in Ssu-ma Ch’ien’s\r\nhistory, are inclined to accept the date traditionally assigned to the\r\nwork which passes under his name. The author of the _Hsu Lu_ fails to\r\nappreciate this distinction, and consequently his bitter attack on\r\nCh’en Chen-sun really misses its mark. He makes one of two points,\r\nhowever, which certainly tell in favour of the high antiquity of our \"13\r\nchapters.\" \"Sun Tzŭ,\" he says, \"must have lived in the age of Ching\r\nWang [519-476], because he is frequently plagiarized in subsequent\r\nworks of the Chou, Ch’in and Han dynasties.\" The two most shameless\r\noffenders in this respect are Wu Ch’i and Huai-nan Tzŭ, both of them\r\nimportant historical personages in their day. The former lived only a\r\ncentury after the alleged date of Sun Tzŭ, and his death is known to\r\nhave taken place in 381 B.C. It was to him, according to Liu Hsiang,\r\nthat Tseng Shen delivered the _Tso Chuan_, which had been entrusted to\r\nhim by its author. [29] Now the fact that quotations from the _Art of\r\nWar_, acknowledged or otherwise, are to be found in so many authors of\r\ndifferent epochs, establishes a very strong anterior to them all,—in\r\nother words, that Sun Tzŭ’s treatise was already in existence towards\r\nthe end of the 5th century B.C. Further proof of Sun Tzŭ’s antiquity is\r\nfurnished by the archaic or wholly obsolete meanings attaching to a\r\nnumber of the words he uses. A list of these, which might perhaps be\r\nextended, is given in the _Hsu Lu;_ and though some of the\r\ninterpretations are doubtful, the main argument is hardly affected\r\nthereby. Again, it must not be forgotten that Yeh Shui-hsin, a scholar\r\nand critic of the first rank, deliberately pronounces the style of the\r\n13 chapters to belong to the early part of the fifth century. Seeing\r\nthat he is actually engaged in an attempt to disprove the existence of\r\nSun Wu himself, we may be sure that he would not have hesitated to\r\nassign the work to a later date had he not honestly believed the\r\ncontrary. And it is precisely on such a point that the judgment of an\r\neducated Chinaman will carry most weight. Other internal evidence is\r\nnot far to seek. Thus in XIII. § 1, there is an unmistakable allusion\r\nto the ancient system of land-tenure which had already passed away by\r\nthe time of Mencius, who was anxious to see it revived in a modified\r\nform. [30] The only warfare Sun Tzŭ knows is that carried on between\r\nthe various feudal princes, in which armored chariots play a large\r\npart. Their use seems to have entirely died out before the end of the\r\nChou dynasty. He speaks as a man of Wu, a state which ceased to exist\r\nas early as 473 B.C. On this I shall touch presently.\r\n\r\nBut once refer the work to the 5th century or earlier, and the chances\r\nof its being other than a _bonâ fide_ production are sensibly\r\ndiminished. The great age of forgeries did not come until long after.\r\nThat it should have been forged in the period immediately following 473\r\nis particularly unlikely, for no one, as a rule, hastens to identify\r\nhimself with a lost cause. As for Yeh Shui-hsin’s theory, that the\r\nauthor was a literary recluse, that seems to me quite untenable. If one\r\nthing is more apparent than another after reading the maxims of Sun\r\nTzŭ, it is that their essence has been distilled from a large store of\r\npersonal observation and experience. They reflect the mind not only of\r\na born strategist, gifted with a rare faculty of generalization, but\r\nalso of a practical soldier closely acquainted with the military\r\nconditions of his time. To say nothing of the fact that these sayings\r\nhave been accepted and endorsed by all the greatest captains of Chinese\r\nhistory, they offer a combination of freshness and sincerity, acuteness\r\nand common sense, which quite excludes the idea that they were\r\nartificially concocted in the study. If we admit, then, that the 13\r\nchapters were the genuine production of a military man living towards\r\nthe end of the \"_Ch’un Ch’iu_\" period, are we not bound, in spite of\r\nthe silence of the _Tso Chuan_, to accept Ssu-ma Ch’ien’s account in\r\nits entirety? In view of his high repute as a sober historian, must we\r\nnot hesitate to assume that the records he drew upon for Sun Wu’s\r\nbiography were false and untrustworthy? The answer, I fear, must be in\r\nthe negative. There is still one grave, if not fatal, objection to the\r\nchronology involved in the story as told in the _Shih Chi_, which, so\r\nfar as I am aware, nobody has yet pointed out. There are two passages\r\nin Sun Tzŭ in which he alludes to contemporary affairs. The first in in\r\nVI. § 21:—\r\n\r\nThough according to my estimate the soldiers of Yüeh exceed our own in\r\nnumber, that shall advantage them nothing in the matter of victory. I\r\nsay then that victory can be achieved.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe other is in XI. § 30:—\r\n\r\nAsked if an army can be made to imitate the _shuai-jan_, I should\r\nanswer, Yes. For the men of Wu and the men of Yüeh are enemies; yet if\r\nthey are crossing a river in the same boat and are caught by a storm,\r\nthey will come to each other’s assistance just as the left hand helps\r\nthe right.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese two paragraphs are extremely valuable as evidence of the date of\r\ncomposition. They assign the work to the period of the struggle between\r\nWu and Yüeh. So much has been observed by Pi I-hsun. But what has\r\nhitherto escaped notice is that they also seriously impair the\r\ncredibility of Ssu-ma Ch’ien’s narrative. As we have seen above, the\r\nfirst positive date given in connection with Sun Wu is 512 B.C. He is\r\nthen spoken of as a general, acting as confidential adviser to Ho Lu,\r\nso that his alleged introduction to that monarch had already taken\r\nplace, and of course the 13 chapters must have been written earlier\r\nstill. But at that time, and for several years after, down to the\r\ncapture of Ying in 506, Ch’u and not Yüeh, was the great hereditary\r\nenemy of Wu. The two states, Ch’u and Wu, had been constantly at war\r\nfor over half a century, [31] whereas the first war between Wu and Yüeh\r\nwas waged only in 510, [32] and even then was no more than a short\r\ninterlude sandwiched in the midst of the fierce struggle with Ch’u. Now\r\nCh’u is not mentioned in the 13 chapters at all. The natural inference\r\nis that they were written at a time when Yüeh had become the prime\r\nantagonist of Wu, that is, after Ch’u had suffered the great\r\nhumiliation of 506. At this point, a table of dates may be found\r\nuseful.\r\n\r\n\r\nB.C.\r\n514\tAccession of Ho Lu.\r\n512\tHo Lu attacks Ch’u, but is dissuaded from entering Ying,\r\nthe capital. Shih Chi mentions Sun Wu as general.\r\n511\tAnother attack on Ch’u.\r\n510\tWu makes a successful attack on Yüeh. This is the first\r\nwar between the two states.\r\n509 or 508\tCh’u invades Wu, but is signally defeated at Yu-chang.\r\n506\tHo Lu attacks Ch’u with the aid of T’ang and Ts’ai.\r\nDecisive battle of Po-chu, and capture of Ying. Last\r\nmention of Sun Wu in Shih Chi.\r\n505\tYüeh makes a raid on Wu in the absence of its army. Wu\r\nis beaten by Ch’in and evacuates Ying.\r\n504\tHo Lu sends Fu Ch’ai to attack Ch’u.\r\n497\tKou Chien becomes King of Yüeh.\r\n496\tWu attacks Yüeh, but is defeated by Kou Chien at Tsui-li.\r\nHo Lu is killed.\r\n494\tFu Ch’ai defeats Kou Chien in the great battle of Fu-\r\nchaio, and enters the capital of Yüeh.\r\n485 or 484\tKou Chien renders homage to Wu. Death of Wu Tzŭ-hsu.\r\n482\tKou Chien invades Wu in the absence of Fu Ch’ai.\r\n478 to 476\tFurther attacks by Yüeh on Wu.\r\n475\tKou Chien lays siege to the capital of Wu.\r\n473\tFinal defeat and extinction of Wu.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sentence quoted above from VI. § 21 hardly strikes me as one that\r\ncould have been written in the full flush of victory. It seems rather\r\nto imply that, for the moment at least, the tide had turned against Wu,\r\nand that she was getting the worst of the struggle. Hence we may\r\nconclude that our treatise was not in existence in 505, before which\r\ndate Yüeh does not appear to have scored any notable success against\r\nWu. Ho Lu died in 496, so that if the book was written for him, it must\r\nhave been during the period 505-496, when there was a lull in the\r\nhostilities, Wu having presumably exhausted by its supreme effort\r\nagainst Ch’u. On the other hand, if we choose to disregard the\r\ntradition connecting Sun Wu’s name with Ho Lu, it might equally well\r\nhave seen the light between 496 and 494, or possibly in the period\r\n482-473, when Yüeh was once again becoming a very serious menace. [33]\r\nWe may feel fairly certain that the author, whoever he may have been,\r\nwas not a man of any great eminence in his own day. On this point the\r\nnegative testimony of the _Tso Chuan_ far outweighs any shred of\r\nauthority still attaching to the _Shih Chi_, if once its other facts\r\nare discredited. Sun Hsing-yen, however, makes a feeble attempt to\r\nexplain the omission of his name from the great commentary. It was Wu\r\nTzŭ-hsu, he says, who got all the credit of Sun Wu’s exploits, because\r\nthe latter (being an alien) was not rewarded with an office in the\r\nState.\r\n\r\nHow then did the Sun Tzŭ legend originate? It may be that the growing\r\ncelebrity of the book imparted by degrees a kind of factitious renown\r\nto its author. It was felt to be only right and proper that one so well\r\nversed in the science of war should have solid achievements to his\r\ncredit as well. Now the capture of Ying was undoubtedly the greatest\r\nfeat of arms in Ho Lu’s reign; it made a deep and lasting impression on\r\nall the surrounding states, and raised Wu to the short-lived zenith of\r\nher power. Hence, what more natural, as time went on, than that the\r\nacknowledged master of strategy, Sun Wu, should be popularly identified\r\nwith that campaign, at first perhaps only in the sense that his brain\r\nconceived and planned it; afterwards, that it was actually carried out\r\nby him in conjunction with Wu Yuan, [34] Po P’ei and Fu Kai?\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that any attempt to reconstruct even the outline of Sun\r\nTzŭ’s life must be based almost wholly on conjecture. With this\r\nnecessary proviso, I should say that he probably entered the service of\r\nWu about the time of Ho Lu’s accession, and gathered experience, though\r\nonly in the capacity of a subordinate officer, during the intense\r\nmilitary activity which marked the first half of the prince’s reign.\r\n[35] If he rose to be a general at all, he certainly was never on an\r\nequal footing with the three above mentioned. He was doubtless present\r\nat the investment and occupation of Ying, and witnessed Wu’s sudden\r\ncollapse in the following year. Yüeh’s attack at this critical\r\njuncture, when her rival was embarrassed on every side, seems to have\r\nconvinced him that this upstart kingdom was the great enemy against\r\nwhom every effort would henceforth have to be directed. Sun Wu was thus\r\na well-seasoned warrior when he sat down to write his famous book,\r\nwhich according to my reckoning must have appeared towards the end,\r\nrather than the beginning of Ho Lu’s reign. The story of the women may\r\npossibly have grown out of some real incident occurring about the same\r\ntime. As we hear no more of Sun Wu after this from any source, he is\r\nhardly likely to have survived his patron or to have taken part in the\r\ndeath-struggle with Yüeh, which began with the disaster at Tsui-li.\r\n\r\nIf these inferences are approximately correct, there is a certain irony\r\nin the fate which decreed that China’s most illustrious man of peace\r\nshould be contemporary with her greatest writer on war.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Text of Sun Tzŭ\r\n\r\nI have found it difficult to glean much about the history of Sun Tzŭ’s\r\ntext. The quotations that occur in early authors go to show that the\r\n\"13 chapters\" of which Ssu-ma Ch’ien speaks were essentially the same\r\nas those now extant. We have his word for it that they were widely\r\ncirculated in his day, and can only regret that he refrained from\r\ndiscussing them on that account. Sun Hsing-yen says in his preface:—\r\n\r\nDuring the Ch’in and Han dynasties Sun Tzŭ’s _Art of War_ was in\r\ngeneral use amongst military commanders, but they seem to have treated\r\nit as a work of mysterious import, and were unwilling to expound it for\r\nthe benefit of posterity. Thus it came about that Wei Wu was the first\r\nto write a commentary on it.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs we have already seen, there is no reasonable ground to suppose that\r\nTs’ao Kung tampered with the text. But the text itself is often so\r\nobscure, and the number of editions which appeared from that time\r\nonward so great, especially during the T’ang and Sung dynasties, that\r\nit would be surprising if numerous corruptions had not managed to creep\r\nin. Towards the middle of the Sung period, by which time all the chief\r\ncommentaries on Sun Tzŭ were in existence, a certain Chi T’ien-pao\r\npublished a work in 15 _chuan_ entitled \"Sun Tzŭ with the collected\r\ncommentaries of ten writers.\" There was another text, with variant\r\nreadings put forward by Chu Fu of Ta-hsing, which also had supporters\r\namong the scholars of that period; but in the Ming editions, Sun\r\nHsing-yen tells us, these readings were for some reason or other no\r\nlonger put into circulation. Thus, until the end of the 18th century,\r\nthe text in sole possession of the field was one derived from Chi\r\nT’ien-pao’s edition, although no actual copy of that important work was\r\nknown to have survived. That, therefore, is the text of Sun Tzŭ which\r\nappears in the War section of the great Imperial encyclopedia printed\r\nin 1726, the _Ku Chin T’u Shu Chi Ch’eng_. Another copy at my disposal\r\nof what is practically the same text, with slight variations, is that\r\ncontained in the \"Eleven philosophers of the Chou and Ch’in dynasties\"\r\n[1758]. And the Chinese printed in Capt. Calthrop’s first edition is\r\nevidently a similar version which has filtered through Japanese\r\nchannels. So things remained until Sun Hsing-yen [1752-1818], a\r\ndistinguished antiquarian and classical scholar, who claimed to be an\r\nactual descendant of Sun Wu, [36] accidentally discovered a copy of Chi\r\nT’ien-pao’s long-lost work, when on a visit to the library of the\r\nHua-yin temple. [37] Appended to it was the _I Shuo_ of Cheng Yu-Hsien,\r\nmentioned in the _T’ung Chih_, and also believed to have perished. This\r\nis what Sun Hsing-yen designates as the \"original edition (or text)\"—a\r\nrather misleading name, for it cannot by any means claim to set before\r\nus the text of Sun Tzŭ in its pristine purity. Chi T’ien-pao was a\r\ncareless compiler, and appears to have been content to reproduce the\r\nsomewhat debased version current in his day, without troubling to\r\ncollate it with the earliest editions then available. Fortunately, two\r\nversions of Sun Tzŭ, even older than the newly discovered work, were\r\nstill extant, one buried in the _T’ung Tien_, Tu Yu’s great treatise on\r\nthe Constitution, the other similarly enshrined in the _T’ai P’ing Yu\r\nLan_ encyclopedia. In both the complete text is to be found, though\r\nsplit up into fragments, intermixed with other matter, and scattered\r\npiecemeal over a number of different sections. Considering that the _Yu\r\nLan_ takes us back to the year 983, and the _T’ung Tien_ about 200\r\nyears further still, to the middle of the T’ang dynasty, the value of\r\nthese early transcripts of Sun Tzŭ can hardly be overestimated. Yet the\r\nidea of utilizing them does not seem to have occurred to anyone until\r\nSun Hsing-yen, acting under Government instructions, undertook a\r\nthorough recension of the text. This is his own account:—\r\n\r\nBecause of the numerous mistakes in the text of Sun Tzŭ which his\r\neditors had handed down, the Government ordered that the ancient\r\nedition [of Chi T’ien-pao] should be used, and that the text should be\r\nrevised and corrected throughout. It happened that Wu Nien-hu, the\r\nGovernor Pi Kua, and Hsi, a graduate of the second degree, had all\r\ndevoted themselves to this study, probably surpassing me therein.\r\nAccordingly, I have had the whole work cut on blocks as a textbook for\r\nmilitary men.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe three individuals here referred to had evidently been occupied on\r\nthe text of Sun Tzŭ prior to Sun Hsing-yen’s commission, but we are\r\nleft in doubt as to the work they really accomplished. At any rate, the\r\nnew edition, when ultimately produced, appeared in the names of Sun\r\nHsing-yen and only one co-editor Wu Jen-shi. They took the \"original\r\nedition\" as their basis, and by careful comparison with older versions,\r\nas well as the extant commentaries and other sources of information\r\nsuch as the _I Shuo_, succeeded in restoring a very large number of\r\ndoubtful passages, and turned out, on the whole, what must be accepted\r\nas the closest approximation we are ever likely to get to Sun Tzŭ’s\r\noriginal work. This is what will hereafter be denominated the \"standard\r\ntext.\"\r\n\r\nThe copy which I have used belongs to a reissue dated 1877. It is in 6\r\n_pen_, forming part of a well-printed set of 23 early philosophical\r\nworks in 83 _pen_. [38] It opens with a preface by Sun Hsing-yen\r\n(largely quoted in this introduction), vindicating the traditional view\r\nof Sun Tzŭ’s life and performances, and summing up in remarkably\r\nconcise fashion the evidence in its favour. This is followed by Ts’ao\r\nKung’s preface to his edition, and the biography of Sun Tzŭ from the\r\n_Shih Chi_, both translated above. Then come, firstly, Cheng Yu-hsien’s\r\n_I Shuo_, [39] with author’s preface, and next, a short miscellany of\r\nhistorical and bibliographical information entitled _Sun Tzŭ Hsu Lu_,\r\ncompiled by Pi I-hsun. As regards the body of the work, each separate\r\nsentence is followed by a note on the text, if required, and then by\r\nthe various commentaries appertaining to it, arranged in chronological\r\norder. These we shall now proceed to discuss briefly, one by one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Commentators\r\n\r\nSun Tzŭ can boast an exceptionally long distinguished roll of\r\ncommentators, which would do honour to any classic. Ou-yang Hsiu remarks\r\non this fact, though he wrote before the tale was complete, and rather\r\ningeniously explains it by saying that the artifices of war, being\r\ninexhaustible, must therefore be susceptible of treatment in a great\r\nvariety of ways.\r\n\r\n1. TS’AO TS’AO or Ts’ao Kung, afterwards known as Wei Wu Ti [A.D.\r\n155-220]. There is hardly any room for doubt that the earliest\r\ncommentary on Sun Tzŭ actually came from the pen of this extraordinary\r\nman, whose biography in the _San Kuo Chih_ reads like a romance. One of\r\nthe greatest military geniuses that the world has seen, and Napoleonic\r\nin the scale of his operations, he was especially famed for the\r\nmarvelous rapidity of his marches, which has found expression in the\r\nline \"Talk of Ts’ao Ts’ao, and Ts’ao Ts’ao will appear.\" Ou-yang Hsiu\r\nsays of him that he was a great captain who \"measured his strength\r\nagainst Tung Cho, Lu Pu and the two Yuan, father and son, and\r\nvanquished them all; whereupon he divided the Empire of Han with Wu and\r\nShu, and made himself king. It is recorded that whenever a council of\r\nwar was held by Wei on the eve of a far-reaching campaign, he had all\r\nhis calculations ready; those generals who made use of them did not\r\nlose one battle in ten; those who ran counter to them in any particular\r\nsaw their armies incontinently beaten and put to flight.\" Ts’ao Kung’s\r\nnotes on Sun Tzŭ, models of austere brevity, are so thoroughly\r\ncharacteristic of the stern commander known to history, that it is hard\r\nindeed to conceive of them as the work of a mere _littérateur_.\r\nSometimes, indeed, owing to extreme compression, they are scarcely\r\nintelligible and stand no less in need of a commentary than the text\r\nitself. [40]\r\n\r\n2. MENG SHIH. The commentary which has come down to us under this name\r\nis comparatively meager, and nothing about the author is known. Even\r\nhis personal name has not been recorded. Chi T’ien-pao’s edition places\r\nhim after Chia Lin, and Ch’ao Kung-wu also assigns him to the T’ang\r\ndynasty, [41] but this is a mistake. In Sun Hsing-yen’s preface, he\r\nappears as Meng Shih of the Liang dynasty [502-557]. Others would\r\nidentify him with Meng K’ang of the 3rd century. He is named in one\r\nwork as the last of the \"Five Commentators,\" the others being Wei Wu\r\nTi, Tu Mu, Ch’en Hao and Chia Lin.\r\n\r\n3. LI CH’UAN of the 8th century was a well-known writer on military\r\ntactics. One of his works has been in constant use down to the present\r\nday. The _T’ung Chih_ mentions \"Lives of famous generals from the Chou\r\nto the T’ang dynasty\" as written by him. [42] According to Ch’ao\r\nKung-wu and the _T’ien-i-ko_ catalogue, he followed a variant of the\r\ntext of Sun Tzŭ which differs considerably from those now extant. His\r\nnotes are mostly short and to the point, and he frequently illustrates\r\nhis remarks by anecdotes from Chinese history.\r\n\r\n4. TU YU (died 812) did not publish a separate commentary on Sun Tzŭ,\r\nhis notes being taken from the _T’ung Tien_, the encyclopedic treatise\r\non the Constitution which was his life-work. They are largely\r\nrepetitions of Ts’ao Kung and Meng Shih, besides which it is believed\r\nthat he drew on the ancient commentaries of Wang Ling and others. Owing\r\nto the peculiar arrangement of _T’ung Tien_, he has to explain each\r\npassage on its merits, apart from the context, and sometimes his own\r\nexplanation does not agree with that of Ts’ao Kung, whom he always\r\nquotes first. Though not strictly to be reckoned as one of the \"Ten\r\nCommentators,\" he was added to their number by Chi T’ien-pao, being\r\nwrongly placed after his grandson Tu Mu.\r\n\r\n5. TU MU (803-852) is perhaps the best known as a poet—a bright star\r\neven in the glorious galaxy of the T’ang period. We learn from Ch’ao\r\nKung-wu that although he had no practical experience of war, he was\r\nextremely fond of discussing the subject, and was moreover well read in\r\nthe military history of the _Ch’un Ch’iu_ and _Chan Kuo_ eras. His\r\nnotes, therefore, are well worth attention. They are very copious, and\r\nreplete with historical parallels. The gist of Sun Tzŭ’s work is thus\r\nsummarized by him: \"Practice benevolence and justice, but on the other\r\nhand make full use of artifice and measures of expediency.\" He further\r\ndeclared that all the military triumphs and disasters of the thousand\r\nyears which had elapsed since Sun Tzŭ’s death would, upon examination,\r\nbe found to uphold and corroborate, in every particular, the maxims\r\ncontained in his book. Tu Mu’s somewhat spiteful charge against Ts’ao\r\nKung has already been considered elsewhere.\r\n\r\n6. CH’EN HAO appears to have been a contemporary of Tu Mu. Ch’ao\r\nKung-wu says that he was impelled to write a new commentary on Sun Tzŭ\r\nbecause Ts’ao Kung’s on the one hand was too obscure and subtle, and\r\nthat of Tu Mu on the other too long-winded and diffuse. Ou-yang Hsiu,\r\nwriting in the middle of the 11th century, calls Ts’ao Kung, Tu Mu and\r\nCh’en Hao the three chief commentators on Sun Tzŭ, and observes that\r\nCh’en Hao is continually attacking Tu Mu’s shortcomings. His\r\ncommentary, though not lacking in merit, must rank below those of his\r\npredecessors.\r\n\r\n7. CHIA LIN is known to have lived under the T’ang dynasty, for his\r\ncommentary on Sun Tzŭ is mentioned in the _T’ang Shu_ and was\r\nafterwards republished by Chi Hsieh of the same dynasty together with\r\nthose of Meng Shih and Tu Yu. It is of somewhat scanty texture, and in\r\npoint of quality, too, perhaps the least valuable of the eleven.\r\n\r\n8. MEI YAO-CH’EN (1002-1060), commonly known by his \"style\" as Mei\r\nSheng-yu, was, like Tu Mu, a poet of distinction. His commentary was\r\npublished with a laudatory preface by the great Ou-yang Hsiu, from\r\nwhich we may cull the following:—\r\n\r\nLater scholars have misread Sun Tzŭ, distorting his words and trying to\r\nmake them square with their own one-sided views. Thus, though\r\ncommentators have not been lacking, only a few have proved equal to the\r\ntask. My friend Sheng-yu has not fallen into this mistake. In\r\nattempting to provide a critical commentary for Sun Tzŭ’s work, he does\r\nnot lose sight of the fact that these sayings were intended for states\r\nengaged in internecine warfare; that the author is not concerned with\r\nthe military conditions prevailing under the sovereigns of the three\r\nancient dynasties, [43] nor with the nine punitive measures prescribed\r\nto the Minister of War. [44] Again, Sun Wu loved brevity of diction,\r\nbut his meaning is always deep. Whether the subject be marching an\r\narmy, or handling soldiers, or estimating the enemy, or controlling the\r\nforces of victory, it is always systematically treated; the sayings are\r\nbound together in strict logical sequence, though this has been\r\nobscured by commentators who have probably failed to grasp their\r\nmeaning. In his own commentary, Mei Sheng-yu has brushed aside all the\r\nobstinate prejudices of these critics, and has tried to bring out the\r\ntrue meaning of Sun Tzŭ himself. In this way, the clouds of confusion\r\nhave been dispersed and the sayings made clear. I am convinced that the\r\npresent work deserves to be handed down side by side with the three\r\ngreat commentaries; and for a great deal that they find in the sayings,\r\ncoming generations will have constant reason to thank my friend\r\nSheng-yu.\r\n\r\n\r\nMaking some allowance for the exuberance of friendship, I am inclined\r\nto endorse this favourable judgment, and would certainly place him above\r\nCh’en Hao in order of merit.\r\n\r\n9. WANG HSI, also of the Sung dynasty, is decidedly original in some of\r\nhis interpretations, but much less judicious than Mei Yao-ch’en, and on\r\nthe whole not a very trustworthy guide. He is fond of comparing his own\r\ncommentary with that of Ts’ao Kung, but the comparison is not often\r\nflattering to him. We learn from Ch’ao Kung-wu that Wang Hsi revised\r\nthe ancient text of Sun Tzŭ, filling up lacunae and correcting\r\nmistakes. [45]\r\n\r\n10. HO YEN-HSI of the Sung dynasty. The personal name of this\r\ncommentator is given as above by Cheng Ch’iao in the _Tung Chih_,\r\nwritten about the middle of the twelfth century, but he appears simply\r\nas Ho Shih in the _Yu Hai_, and Ma Tuan-lin quotes Ch’ao Kung-wu as\r\nsaying that his personal name is unknown. There seems to be no reason\r\nto doubt Cheng Ch’iao’s statement, otherwise I should have been\r\ninclined to hazard a guess and identify him with one Ho Ch’u-fei, the\r\nauthor of a short treatise on war, who lived in the latter part of the\r\n11th century. Ho Shih’s commentary, in the words of the _T’ien-i-ko_\r\ncatalogue, \"contains helpful additions\" here and there, but is chiefly\r\nremarkable for the copious extracts taken, in adapted form, from the\r\ndynastic histories and other sources.\r\n\r\n11. CHANG YU. The list closes with a commentator of no great\r\noriginality perhaps, but gifted with admirable powers of lucid\r\nexposition. His commentator is based on that of Ts’ao Kung, whose terse\r\nsentences he contrives to expand and develop in masterly fashion.\r\nWithout Chang Yu, it is safe to say that much of Ts’ao Kung’s\r\ncommentary would have remained cloaked in its pristine obscurity and\r\ntherefore valueless. His work is not mentioned in the Sung history, the\r\n_T’ung K’ao_, or the _Yu Hai_, but it finds a niche in the _T’ung\r\nChih_, which also names him as the author of the \"Lives of Famous\r\nGenerals.\" [46]\r\n\r\nIt is rather remarkable that the last-named four should all have\r\nflourished within so short a space of time. Ch’ao Kung-wu accounts for\r\nit by saying: \"During the early years of the Sung dynasty the Empire\r\nenjoyed a long spell of peace, and men ceased to practice the art of\r\nwar. but when [Chao] Yuan-hao’s rebellion came [1038-42] and the\r\nfrontier generals were defeated time after time, the Court made\r\nstrenuous inquiry for men skilled in war, and military topics became\r\nthe vogue amongst all the high officials. Hence it is that the\r\ncommentators of Sun Tzŭ in our dynasty belong mainly to that period.\r\n[47]\r\n\r\nBesides these eleven commentators, there are several others whose work\r\nhas not come down to us. The _Sui Shu_ mentions four, namely Wang Ling\r\n(often quoted by Tu Yu as Wang Tzŭ); Chang Tzŭ-shang; Chia Hsu of Wei;\r\n[48] and Shen Yu of Wu. The _T’ang Shu_ adds Sun Hao, and the _T’ung\r\nChih_ Hsiao Chi, while the _T’u Shu_ mentions a Ming commentator, Huang\r\nJun-yu. It is possible that some of these may have been merely\r\ncollectors and editors of other commentaries, like Chi T’ien-pao and\r\nChi Hsieh, mentioned above.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppreciations of Sun Tzŭ\r\n\r\nSun Tzŭ has exercised a potent fascination over the minds of some of\r\nChina’s greatest men. Among the famous generals who are known to have\r\nstudied his pages with enthusiasm may be mentioned Han Hsin (_d_. 196\r\nB.C.), [49] Feng I (_d_. 34 A.D.), [50] Lu Meng (_d_. 219), [51] and Yo\r\nFei (1103-1141). [52] The opinion of Ts’ao Kung, who disputes with Han\r\nHsin the highest place in Chinese military annals, has already been\r\nrecorded. [53] Still more remarkable, in one way, is the testimony of\r\npurely literary men, such as Su Hsun (the father of Su Tung-p’o), who\r\nwrote several essays on military topics, all of which owe their chief\r\ninspiration to Sun Tzŭ. The following short passage by him is preserved\r\nin the _Yu Hai:_ [54]—\r\n\r\nSun Wu’s saying, that in war one cannot make certain of conquering,\r\n[55] is very different indeed from what other books tell us. [56] Wu\r\nCh’i was a man of the same stamp as Sun Wu: they both wrote books on\r\nwar, and they are linked together in popular speech as \"Sun and Wu.\"\r\nBut Wu Ch’i’s remarks on war are less weighty, his rules are rougher\r\nand more crudely stated, and there is not the same unity of plan as in\r\nSun Tzŭ’s work, where the style is terse, but the meaning fully brought\r\nout.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following is an extract from the \"Impartial Judgments in the Garden\r\nof Literature\" by Cheng Hou:—\r\n\r\nSun Tzŭ’s 13 chapters are not only the staple and base of all military\r\nmen’s training, but also compel the most careful attention of scholars\r\nand men of letters. His sayings are terse yet elegant, simple yet\r\nprofound, perspicuous and eminently practical. Such works as the _Lun\r\nYu_, the _I Ching_ and the great Commentary, [57] as well as the\r\nwritings of Mencius, Hsun K’uang and Yang Chu, all fall below the level\r\nof Sun Tzŭ.\r\n\r\n\r\nChu Hsi, commenting on this, fully admits the first part of the\r\ncriticism, although he dislikes the audacious comparison with the\r\nvenerated classical works. Language of this sort, he says, \"encourages\r\na ruler’s bent towards unrelenting warfare and reckless militarism.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApologies for War\r\n\r\nAccustomed as we are to think of China as the greatest peace-loving\r\nnation on earth, we are in some danger of forgetting that her\r\nexperience of war in all its phases has also been such as no modern\r\nState can parallel. Her long military annals stretch back to a point at\r\nwhich they are lost in the mists of time. She had built the Great Wall\r\nand was maintaining a huge standing army along her frontier centuries\r\nbefore the first Roman legionary was seen on the Danube. What with the\r\nperpetual collisions of the ancient feudal States, the grim conflicts\r\nwith Huns, Turks and other invaders after the centralization of\r\ngovernment, the terrific upheavals which accompanied the overthrow of\r\nso many dynasties, besides the countless rebellions and minor\r\ndisturbances that have flamed up and flickered out again one by one, it\r\nis hardly too much to say that the clash of arms has never ceased to\r\nresound in one portion or another of the Empire.\r\n\r\nNo less remarkable is the succession of illustrious captains to whom\r\nChina can point with pride. As in all countries, the greatest are fond\r\nof emerging at the most fateful crises of her history. Thus, Po Ch’i\r\nstands out conspicuous in the period when Ch’in was entering upon her\r\nfinal struggle with the remaining independent states. The stormy years\r\nwhich followed the break-up of the Ch’in dynasty are illuminated by the\r\ntranscendent genius of Han Hsin. When the House of Han in turn is\r\ntottering to its fall, the great and baleful figure of Ts’ao Ts’ao\r\ndominates the scene. And in the establishment of the T’ang dynasty, one\r\nof the mightiest tasks achieved by man, the superhuman energy of Li\r\nShih-min (afterwards the Emperor T’ai Tsung) was seconded by the\r\nbrilliant strategy of Li Ching. None of these generals need fear\r\ncomparison with the greatest names in the military history of Europe.\r\n\r\nIn spite of all this, the great body of Chinese sentiment, from Lao Tzŭ\r\ndownwards, and especially as reflected in the standard literature of\r\nConfucianism, has been consistently pacific and intensely opposed to\r\nmilitarism in any form. It is such an uncommon thing to find any of the\r\nliterati defending warfare on principle, that I have thought it worth\r\nwhile to collect and translate a few passages in which the unorthodox\r\nview is upheld. The following, by Ssu-ma Ch’ien, shows that for all his\r\nardent admiration of Confucius, he was yet no advocate of peace at any\r\nprice:—\r\n\r\nMilitary weapons are the means used by the Sage to punish violence and\r\ncruelty, to give peace to troublous times, to remove difficulties and\r\ndangers, and to succour those who are in peril. Every animal with blood\r\nin its veins and horns on its head will fight when it is attacked. How\r\nmuch more so will man, who carries in his breast the faculties of love\r\nand hatred, joy and anger! When he is pleased, a feeling of affection\r\nsprings up within him; when angry, his poisoned sting is brought into\r\nplay. That is the natural law which governs his being…. What then shall\r\nbe said of those scholars of our time, blind to all great issues, and\r\nwithout any appreciation of relative values, who can only bark out\r\ntheir stale formulas about \"virtue\" and \"civilization,\" condemning the\r\nuse of military weapons? They will surely bring our country to\r\nimpotence and dishonour and the loss of her rightful heritage; or, at\r\nthe very least, they will bring about invasion and rebellion, sacrifice\r\nof territory and general enfeeblement. Yet they obstinately refuse to\r\nmodify the position they have taken up. The truth is that, just as in\r\nthe family the teacher must not spare the rod, and punishments cannot\r\nbe dispensed with in the State, so military chastisement can never be\r\nallowed to fall into abeyance in the Empire. All one can say is that\r\nthis power will be exercised wisely by some, foolishly by others, and\r\nthat among those who bear arms some will be loyal and others\r\nrebellious. [58]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next piece is taken from Tu Mu’s preface to his commentary on Sun\r\nTzŭ:—\r\n\r\n\r\nWar may be defined as punishment, which is one of the functions of\r\ngovernment. It was the profession of Chung Yu and Jan Ch’iu, both\r\ndisciples of Confucius. Nowadays, the holding of trials and hearing of\r\nlitigation, the imprisonment of offenders and their execution by\r\nflogging in the market-place, are all done by officials. But the\r\nwielding of huge armies, the throwing down of fortified cities, the\r\nhauling of women and children into captivity, and the beheading of\r\ntraitors—this is also work which is done by officials. The objects of\r\nthe rack and of military weapons are essentially the same. There is no\r\nintrinsic difference between the punishment of flogging and cutting off\r\nheads in war. For the lesser infractions of law, which are easily dealt\r\nwith, only a small amount of force need be employed: hence the use of\r\nmilitary weapons and wholesale decapitation. In both cases, however,\r\nthe end in view is to get rid of wicked people, and to give comfort and\r\nrelief to the good….\r\n\r\nChi-sun asked Jan Yu, saying: \"Have you, Sir, acquired your military\r\naptitude by study, or is it innate?\" Jan Yu replied: \"It has been\r\nacquired by study.\" [59] \"How can that be so,\" said Chi-sun, \"seeing\r\nthat you are a disciple of Confucius?\" \"It is a fact,\" replied Jan Yu;\r\n\"I was taught by Confucius. It is fitting that the great Sage should\r\nexercise both civil and military functions, though to be sure my\r\ninstruction in the art of fighting has not yet gone very far.\"\r\n\r\nNow, who the author was of this rigid distinction between the \"civil\"\r\nand the \"military,\" and the limitation of each to a separate sphere of\r\naction, or in what year of which dynasty it was first introduced, is\r\nmore than I can say. But, at any rate, it has come about that the\r\nmembers of the governing class are quite afraid of enlarging on\r\nmilitary topics, or do so only in a shamefaced manner. If any are bold\r\nenough to discuss the subject, they are at once set down as eccentric\r\nindividuals of coarse and brutal propensities. This is an extraordinary\r\ninstance in which, through sheer lack of reasoning, men unhappily lose\r\nsight of fundamental principles.\r\n\r\nWhen the Duke of Chou was minister under Ch’eng Wang, he regulated\r\nceremonies and made music, and venerated the arts of scholarship and\r\nlearning; yet when the barbarians of the River Huai revolted, [60] he\r\nsallied forth and chastised them. When Confucius held office under the\r\nDuke of Lu, and a meeting was convened at Chia-ku, [61] he said: \"If\r\npacific negotiations are in progress, warlike preparations should have\r\nbeen made beforehand.\" He rebuked and shamed the Marquis of Ch’i, who\r\ncowered under him and dared not proceed to violence. How can it be said\r\nthat these two great Sages had no knowledge of military matters?\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the great Chu Hsi held Sun Tzŭ in high esteem. He\r\nalso appeals to the authority of the Classics:—\r\n\r\nOur Master Confucius, answering Duke Ling of Wei, said: \"I have never\r\nstudied matters connected with armies and battalions.\" [62] Replying to\r\nK’ung Wen-tzu, he said: I have not been instructed about buff-coats and\r\nweapons.\" But if we turn to the meeting at Chia-ku, we find that he\r\nused armed force against the men of Lai, so that the marquis of Ch’i\r\nwas overawed. Again, when the inhabitants of Pi revolted; he ordered\r\nhis officers to attack them, whereupon they were defeated and fled in\r\nconfusion. He once uttered the words: \"If I fight, I conquer.\" [63] And\r\nJan Yu also said: \"The Sage exercises both civil and military\r\nfunctions.\" [64] Can it be a fact that Confucius never studied or\r\nreceived instruction in the art of war? We can only say that he did not\r\nspecially choose matters connected with armies and fighting to be the\r\nsubject of his teaching.\r\n\r\n\r\nSun Hsing-yen, the editor of Sun Tzŭ, writes in similar strain:—\r\n\r\n\r\nConfucius said: \"I am unversed in military matters.\" [65] He also said:\r\n\"If I fight, I conquer.\" Confucius ordered ceremonies and regulated\r\nmusic. Now war constitutes one of the five classes of State ceremonial,\r\n[66] and must not be treated as an independent branch of study. Hence,\r\nthe words \"I am unversed in\" must be taken to mean that there are\r\nthings which even an inspired Teacher does not know. Those who have to\r\nlead an army and devise stratagems, must learn the art of war. But if\r\none can command the services of a good general like Sun Tzŭ, who was\r\nemployed by Wu Tzŭ-hsu, there is no need to learn it oneself. Hence the\r\nremark added by Confucius: \"If I fight, I conquer.\"\r\n\r\nThe men of the present day, however, willfully interpret these words of\r\nConfucius in their narrowest sense, as though he meant that books on\r\nthe art of war were not worth reading. With blind persistency, they\r\nadduce the example of Chao Kua, who pored over his father’s books to no\r\npurpose, [67] as a proof that all military theory is useless. Again,\r\nseeing that books on war have to do with such things as opportunism in\r\ndesigning plans, and the conversion of spies, they hold that the art is\r\nimmoral and unworthy of a sage. These people ignore the fact that the\r\nstudies of our scholars and the civil administration of our officials\r\nalso require steady application and practice before efficiency is\r\nreached. The ancients were particularly chary of allowing mere novices\r\nto botch their work. [68] Weapons are baneful [69] and fighting\r\nperilous; and useless unless a general is in constant practice, he\r\nought not to hazard other men’s lives in battle. [70] Hence it is\r\nessential that Sun Tzŭ’s 13 chapters should be studied.\r\n\r\nHsiang Liang used to instruct his nephew Chi [71] in the art of war.\r\nChi got a rough idea of the art in its general bearings, but would not\r\npursue his studies to their proper outcome, the consequence being that\r\nhe was finally defeated and overthrown. He did not realize that the\r\ntricks and artifices of war are beyond verbal computation. Duke Hsiang\r\nof Sung and King Yen of Hsu were brought to destruction by their\r\nmisplaced humanity. The treacherous and underhand nature of war\r\nnecessitates the use of guile and stratagem suited to the occasion.\r\nThere is a case on record of Confucius himself having violated an\r\nextorted oath, [72] and also of his having left the Sung State in\r\ndisguise. [73] Can we then recklessly arraign Sun Tzŭ for disregarding\r\ntruth and honesty?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBibliography\r\n\r\nThe following are the oldest Chinese treatises on war, after Sun Tzŭ.\r\nThe notes on each have been drawn principally from the _Ssu k’u ch’uan\r\nshu chien ming mu lu_, ch. 9, fol. 22 sqq.\r\n\r\n1. _Wu Tzŭ_, in 1 _chuan_ or 6 chapters. By Wu Ch’i (_d_. 381 B.C.). A\r\ngenuine work. See _Shih Chi_, ch. 65.\r\n\r\n2. _Ssu-ma Fa_, in 1 _chuan_ or 5 chapters. Wrongly attributed to\r\nSsu-ma Jang-chu of the 6th century B.C. Its date, however, must be\r\nearly, as the customs of the three ancient dynasties are constantly to\r\nbe met within its pages. See _Shih Chi_, ch. 64.\r\n\r\nThe _Ssu K’u Ch’uan Shu_ (ch. 99, f. 1) remarks that the oldest three\r\ntreatises on war, _Sun Tzŭ_, _Wu Tzŭ_ and _Ssu-ma Fa_, are, generally\r\nspeaking, only concerned with things strictly military—the art of\r\nproducing, collecting, training and drilling troops, and the correct\r\ntheory with regard to measures of expediency, laying plans, transport\r\nof goods and the handling of soldiers—in strong contrast to later\r\nworks, in which the science of war is usually blended with metaphysics,\r\ndivination and magical arts in general.\r\n\r\n3. _Liu T’ao_, in 6 _chuan_, or 60 chapters. Attributed to Lu Wang (or\r\nLu Shang, also known as T’ai Kung) of the 12th century B.C. [74] But\r\nits style does not belong to the era of the Three Dynasties. Lu Te-ming\r\n(550-625 A.D.) mentions the work, and enumerates the headings of the\r\nsix sections so that the forgery cannot have been later than Sui\r\ndynasty.\r\n\r\n4. _Wei Liao Tzŭ_, in 5 _chuan_. Attributed to Wei Liao (4th cent.\r\nB.C.), who studied under the famous Kuei-ku Tzŭ. The work appears to\r\nhave been originally in 31 chapters, whereas the text we possess\r\ncontains only 24. Its matter is sound enough in the main, though the\r\nstrategical devices differ considerably from those of the Warring\r\nStates period. It is been furnished with a commentary by the well-known\r\nSung philosopher Chang Tsai.\r\n\r\n5. _San Lueh_ in 3 _chuan_. Attributed to Huang-shih Kung, a legendary\r\npersonage who is said to have bestowed it on Chang Liang (_d_. 187\r\nB.C.) in an interview on a bridge. But here again, the style is not\r\nthat of works dating from the Ch’in or Han period. The Han Emperor\r\nKuang Wu [25-57 A.D.] apparently quotes from it in one of his\r\nproclamations; but the passage in question may have been inserted later\r\non, in order to prove the genuineness of the work. We shall not be far\r\nout if we refer it to the Northern Sung period [420-478 A.D.], or\r\nsomewhat earlier.\r\n\r\n6. _Li Wei Kung Wen Tui_, in 3 sections. Written in the form of a\r\ndialogue between T’ai Tsung and his great general Li Ching, it is\r\nusually ascribed to the latter. Competent authorities consider it a\r\nforgery, though the author was evidently well versed in the art of war.\r\n\r\n7. _Li Ching Ping Fa_ (not to be confounded with the foregoing) is a\r\nshort treatise in 8 chapters, preserved in the T’ung Tien, but not\r\npublished separately. This fact explains its omission from the _Ssu K’u\r\nCh’uan Shu_.\r\n\r\n8. _Wu Ch’i Ching_, in 1 _chuan_. Attributed to the legendary minister\r\nFeng Hou, with exegetical notes by Kung-sun Hung of the Han dynasty\r\n(_d_. 121 B.C.), and said to have been eulogized by the celebrated\r\ngeneral Ma Lung (_d_. 300 A.D.). Yet the earliest mention of it is in\r\nthe _Sung Chih_. Although a forgery, the work is well put together.\r\n\r\nConsidering the high popular estimation in which Chu-ko Liang has\r\nalways been held, it is not surprising to find more than one work on\r\nwar ascribed to his pen. Such are (1) the _Shih Liu Ts’e_ (1 _chuan_),\r\npreserved in the _Yung Lo Ta Tien;_ (2) _Chiang Yuan_ (1 _chuan_); and\r\n(3) _Hsin Shu_ (1 _chuan_), which steals wholesale from Sun Tzŭ. None\r\nof these has the slightest claim to be considered genuine.\r\n\r\nMost of the large Chinese encyclopedias contain extensive sections\r\ndevoted to the literature of war. The following references may be found\r\nuseful:—\r\n\r\n_T’ung Tien_ (circa 800 A.D.), ch. 148-162.\r\n_T’ai P’ing Yu Lan_ (983), ch. 270-359.\r\n_Wen Hsien Tung K’ao_ (13th cent.), ch. 221.\r\n_Yu Hai_ (13th cent.), ch. 140, 141.\r\n_San Ts’ai T’u Hui_ (16th cent).\r\n_Kuang Po Wu Chih_ (1607), ch. 31, 32.\r\n_Ch’ien Ch’io Lei Shu_ (1632), ch. 75.\r\n_Yuan Chien Lei Han_ (1710), ch. 206-229.\r\n_Ku Chin T’u Shu Chi Ch’eng_ (1726), section XXX, esp. ch. 81-90.\r\n_Hsu Wen Hsien T’ung K’ao_ (1784), ch. 121-134.\r\n_Huang Ch’ao Ching Shih Wen Pien_ (1826), ch. 76, 77.\r\n\r\nThe bibliographical sections of certain historical works also deserve\r\nmention:—\r\n\r\n_Ch’ien Han Shu_, ch. 30.\r\n_Sui Shu_, ch. 32-35.\r\n_Chiu T’ang Shu_, ch. 46, 47.\r\n_Hsin T’ang Shu_, ch. 57,60.\r\n_Sung Shih_, ch. 202-209.\r\n_T’ung Chih_ (circa 1150), ch. 68.\r\n\r\nTo these of course must be added the great Catalogue of the Imperial\r\nLibrary:—\r\n\r\n_Ssu K’u Ch’uan Shu Tsung Mu T’i Yao_ (1790), ch. 99, 100.\r\n\r\nFootnotes\r\n\r\n1. _Shih Chi_, ch. 65.\r\n\r\n2.

Native critics refer to a work of the\r\nHan dynasty, which says: \"Ten _li_ outside the _Wu_ gate [of the city\r\nof Wu, now Soochow in Kiangsu] there is a great mound, raised to\r\ncommemorate the entertainment of Sun Wu of Ch’i, who excelled in the\r\nart of war, by the King of Wu.\"\r\n\r\n10. \"They attached strings to wood to make bows, and sharpened wood to\r\nmake arrows. The use of bows and arrows is to keep the Empire in awe.\"\r\n\r\n11. The son and successor of Ho Lu. He was finally defeated and\r\noverthrown by Kou chien, King of Yüeh, in 473 B.C. See post.\r\n\r\n12. King Yen of Hsu, a fabulous being, of whom Sun Hsing-yen says in\r\nhis preface: \"His humanity brought him to destruction.\"\r\n\r\n13. The passage I have put in brackets is omitted in the _T’u Shu_, and\r\nmay be an interpolation. It was known, however to Chang Shou-chieh of\r\nthe T’ang dynasty, and appears in the _T’ai P’ing Yu Lan_.\r\n\r\n14. Ts’ao Kung seems to be thinking of the first part of chap. II,\r\nperhaps especially of § 8.\r\n\r\n15. See chap. XI.\r\n\r\n16. On the other hand, it is noteworthy that _Wu Tzŭ_, which is not in\r\n6 chapters, has 48 assigned to it in the _Han Chih_. Likewise, the\r\n_Chung Yung_ is credited with 49 chapters, though now only in one only.\r\nIn the case of very short works, one is tempted to think that _p’ien_\r\nmight simply mean \"leaves.\"\r\n\r\n17.

Legge thinks that\r\nthe _Tso Chuan_ must have been written in the 5th century, but not\r\nbefore 424 B.C.\r\n\r\n30. See _Mencius_ III. 1. iii. 13-20.\r\n\r\n31. When Wu first appears in the _Ch’un Ch’iu_ in 584, it is already at\r\nvariance with its powerful neighbour. The _Ch’un Ch’iu_ first mentions\r\nYüeh in 537, the _Tso Chuan_ in 601.\r\n\r\n32. This is explicitly stated in the _Tso Chuan_, XXXII, 2.\r\n\r\n33. There is this to be said for the later period, that the feud would\r\ntend to grow more bitter after each encounter, and thus more fully\r\njustify the language used in XI. § 30.\r\n\r\n34. With Wu Yuan himself the case is just the reverse:—a spurious\r\ntreatise on war has been fathered on him simply because he was a great\r\ngeneral. Here we have an obvious inducement to forgery. Sun Wu, on the\r\nother hand, cannot have been widely known to fame in the 5th century.\r\n\r\n35.

Besides the tradition which makes him a\r\nformer minister of Chou Hsin, two other accounts of him are there\r\ngiven, according to which he would appear to have been first raised\r\nfrom a humble private station by Wen Wang.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter I. LAYING PLANS\r\n\r\n[Ts’ao Kung, in defining the meaning of the Chinese for the title of\r\nthis chapter, says it refers to the deliberations in the temple\r\nselected by the general for his temporary use, or as we should say, in\r\nhis tent. See. § 26.]\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Sun Tzŭ said: The art of war is of vital importance to the State.\r\n\r\n2. It is a matter of life and death, a road either to safety or to\r\nruin. Hence it is a subject of inquiry which can on no account be\r\nneglected.\r\n\r\n3. The art of war, then, is governed by five constant factors, to be\r\ntaken into account in one’s deliberations, when seeking to determine\r\nthe conditions obtaining in the field.\r\n\r\n4. These are: (1) The Moral Law; (2) Heaven; (3) Earth; (4) The\r\nCommander; (5) Method and discipline.\r\n\r\n[It appears from what follows that Sun Tzŭ means by \"Moral Law\" a\r\nprinciple of harmony, not unlike the Tao of Lao Tzŭ in its moral\r\naspect. One might be tempted to render it by \"morale,\" were it not\r\nconsidered as an attribute of the _ruler_ in § 13.]\r\n\r\n\r\n5, 6. _The Moral Law_ causes the people to be in complete accord with\r\ntheir ruler, so that they will follow him regardless of their lives,\r\nundismayed by any danger.\r\n\r\n[Tu Yu quotes Wang Tzŭ as saying: \"Without constant practice, the\r\nofficers will be nervous and undecided when mustering for battle;\r\nwithout constant practice, the general will be wavering and irresolute\r\nwhen the crisis is at hand.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n7. _Heaven_ signifies night and day, cold and heat, times and seasons.\r\n\r\n[The commentators, I think, make an unnecessary mystery of two words\r\nhere. Meng Shih refers to \"the hard and the soft, waxing and waning\" of\r\nHeaven. Wang Hsi, however, may be right in saying that what is meant is\r\n\"the general economy of Heaven,\" including the five elements, the four\r\nseasons, wind and clouds, and other phenomena.]\r\n\r\n\r\n8. _Earth_ comprises distances, great and small; danger and security;\r\nopen ground and narrow passes; the chances of life and death.\r\n\r\n9. _The Commander_ stands for the virtues of wisdom, sincerity,\r\nbenevolence, courage and strictness.\r\n\r\n[The five cardinal virtues of the Chinese are (1) humanity or\r\nbenevolence; (2) uprightness of mind; (3) self-respect, self-control,\r\nor \"proper feeling;\" (4) wisdom; (5) sincerity or good faith. Here\r\n\"wisdom\" and \"sincerity\" are put before \"humanity or benevolence,\" and\r\nthe two military virtues of \"courage\" and \"strictness\" substituted for\r\n\"uprightness of mind\" and \"self-respect, self-control, or ‘proper\r\nfeeling.’\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n10. By _Method and discipline_ are to be understood the marshalling of\r\nthe army in its proper subdivisions, the gradations of rank among the\r\nofficers, the maintenance of roads by which supplies may reach the\r\narmy, and the control of military expenditure.\r\n\r\n11. These five heads should be familiar to every general: he who knows\r\nthem will be victorious; he who knows them not will fail.\r\n\r\n12. Therefore, in your deliberations, when seeking to determine the\r\nmilitary conditions, let them be made the basis of a comparison, in\r\nthis wise:—\r\n\r\n13. (1) Which of the two sovereigns is imbued with the Moral law?\r\n\r\n\r\n[I.e., \"is in harmony with his subjects.\" Cf. § 5.]\r\n\r\n\r\n    (2) Which of the two generals has most ability?\r\n    (3) With whom lie the advantages derived from Heaven and Earth?\r\n\r\n[See §§ 7, 8]\r\n\r\n\r\n(4) On which side is discipline most rigorously enforced?\r\n\r\n[Tu Mu alludes to the remarkable story of Ts’ao Ts’ao (A.D. 155-220),\r\nwho was such a strict disciplinarian that once, in accordance with his\r\nown severe regulations against injury to standing crops, he condemned\r\nhimself to death for having allowed his horse to shy into a field of\r\ncorn! However, in lieu of losing his head, he was persuaded to satisfy\r\nhis sense of justice by cutting off his hair. Ts’ao Ts’ao’s own comment\r\non the present passage is characteristically curt: \"when you lay down a\r\nlaw, see that it is not disobeyed; if it is disobeyed the offender must\r\nbe put to death.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n(5) Which army is the stronger?\r\n\r\n[Morally as well as physically. As Mei Yao-ch’en puts it, freely\r\nrendered, \"_esprit de corps_ and ‘big battalions.’\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n(6) On which side are officers and men more highly trained?\r\n\r\n[Tu Yu quotes Wang Tzŭ as saying: \"Without constant practice, the\r\nofficers will be nervous and undecided when mustering for battle;\r\nwithout constant practice, the general will be wavering and irresolute\r\nwhen the crisis is at hand.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n(7) In which army is there the greater constancy both in reward and\r\npunishment?\r\n\r\n[On which side is there the most absolute certainty that merit will be\r\nproperly rewarded and misdeeds summarily punished?]\r\n\r\n\r\n14. By means of these seven considerations I can forecast victory or\r\ndefeat.\r\n\r\n15. The general that hearkens to my counsel and acts upon it, will\r\nconquer:—let such a one be retained in command! The general that\r\nhearkens not to my counsel nor acts upon it, will suffer defeat:—let\r\nsuch a one be dismissed!\r\n\r\n[The form of this paragraph reminds us that Sun Tzŭ’s treatise was\r\ncomposed expressly for the benefit of his patron Ho Lu, king of the Wu\r\nState.]\r\n\r\n\r\n16. While heeding the profit of my counsel, avail yourself also of any\r\nhelpful circumstances over and beyond the ordinary rules.\r\n\r\n17. According as circumstances are favourable, one should modify one’s\r\nplans.\r\n\r\n[Sun Tzŭ, as a practical soldier, will have none of the \"bookish\r\ntheoric.\" He cautions us here not to pin our faith to abstract\r\nprinciples; \"for,\" as Chang Yu puts it, \"while the main laws of\r\nstrategy can be stated clearly enough for the benefit of all and\r\nsundry, you must be guided by the actions of the enemy in attempting to\r\nsecure a favourable position in actual warfare.\" On the eve of the\r\nbattle of Waterloo, Lord Uxbridge, commanding the cavalry, went to the\r\nDuke of Wellington in order to learn what his plans and calculations\r\nwere for the morrow, because, as he explained, he might suddenly find\r\nhimself Commander-in-chief and would be unable to frame new plans in a\r\ncritical moment. The Duke listened quietly and then said: \"Who will\r\nattack the first tomorrow—I or Bonaparte?\" \"Bonaparte,\" replied Lord\r\nUxbridge. \"Well,\" continued the Duke, \"Bonaparte has not given me any\r\nidea of his projects; and as my plans will depend upon his, how can you\r\nexpect me to tell you what mine are?\" [1] ]\r\n\r\n\r\n18. All warfare is based on deception.\r\n\r\n[The truth of this pithy and profound saying will be admitted by every\r\nsoldier. Col. Henderson tells us that Wellington, great in so many\r\nmilitary qualities, was especially distinguished by \"the extraordinary\r\nskill with which he concealed his movements and deceived both friend\r\nand foe.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n19. Hence, when able to attack, we must seem unable; when using our\r\nforces, we must seem inactive; when we are near, we must make the enemy\r\nbelieve we are far away; when far away, we must make him believe we are\r\nnear.\r\n\r\n20. Hold out baits to entice the enemy. Feign disorder, and crush him.\r\n\r\n[All commentators, except Chang Yu, say, \"When he is in disorder, crush\r\nhim.\" It is more natural to suppose that Sun Tzŭ is still illustrating\r\nthe uses of deception in war.]\r\n\r\n\r\n21. If he is secure at all points, be prepared for him. If he is in\r\nsuperior strength, evade him.\r\n\r\n22. If your opponent is of choleric temper, seek to irritate him.\r\nPretend to be weak, that he may grow arrogant.\r\n\r\n[Wang Tzŭ, quoted by Tu Yu, says that the good tactician plays with his\r\nadversary as a cat plays with a mouse, first feigning weakness and\r\nimmobility, and then suddenly pouncing upon him.]\r\n\r\n\r\n23. If he is taking his ease, give him no rest.\r\n\r\n[This is probably the meaning though Mei Yao-ch’en has the note: \"while\r\nwe are taking our ease, wait for the enemy to tire himself out.\" The\r\n_Yu Lan_ has \"Lure him on and tire him out.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nIf his forces are united, separate them.\r\n\r\n[Less plausible is the interpretation favoured by most of the\r\ncommentators: \"If sovereign and subject are in accord, put division\r\nbetween them.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n24. Attack him where he is unprepared, appear where you are not\r\nexpected.\r\n\r\n25. These military devices, leading to victory, must not be divulged\r\nbeforehand.\r\n\r\n26. Now the general who wins a battle makes many calculations in his\r\ntemple ere the battle is fought.\r\n\r\n[Chang Yu tells us that in ancient times it was customary for a temple\r\nto be set apart for the use of a general who was about to take the\r\nfield, in order that he might there elaborate his plan of campaign.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe general who loses a battle makes but few calculations beforehand.\r\nThus do many calculations lead to victory, and few calculations to\r\ndefeat: how much more no calculation at all! It is by attention to this\r\npoint that I can foresee who is likely to win or lose.\r\n\r\n[1] \"Words on Wellington,\" by Sir. W. Fraser.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter II. WAGING WAR\r\n\r\n[Ts’ao Kung has the note: \"He who wishes to fight must first count the\r\ncost,\" which prepares us for the discovery that the subject of the\r\nchapter is not what we might expect from the title, but is primarily a\r\nconsideration of ways and means.]\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Sun Tzŭ said: In the operations of war, where there are in the field\r\na thousand swift chariots, as many heavy chariots, and a hundred\r\nthousand mail-clad soldiers,\r\n\r\n[The \"swift chariots\" were lightly built and, according to Chang Yu,\r\nused for the attack; the \"heavy chariots\" were heavier, and designed\r\nfor purposes of defence. Li Ch’uan, it is true, says that the latter\r\nwere light, but this seems hardly probable. It is interesting to note\r\nthe analogies between early Chinese warfare and that of the Homeric\r\nGreeks. In each case, the war-chariot was the important factor, forming\r\nas it did the nucleus round which was grouped a certain number of\r\nfoot-soldiers. With regard to the numbers given here, we are informed\r\nthat each swift chariot was accompanied by 75 footmen, and each heavy\r\nchariot by 25 footmen, so that the whole army would be divided up into\r\na thousand battalions, each consisting of two chariots and a hundred\r\nmen.]\r\n\r\n\r\nwith provisions enough to carry them a thousand _li_,\r\n\r\n[2.78 modern _li_ go to a mile. The length may have varied slightly\r\nsince Sun Tzŭ’s time.]\r\n\r\n\r\nthe expenditure at home and at the front, including entertainment of\r\nguests, small items such as glue and paint, and sums spent on chariots\r\nand armour, will reach the total of a thousand ounces of silver per\r\nday. Such is the cost of raising an army of 100,000 men.\r\n\r\n2. When you engage in actual fighting, if victory is long in coming,\r\nthe men’s weapons will grow dull and their ardour will be damped. If\r\nyou lay siege to a town, you will exhaust your strength.\r\n\r\n3. Again, if the campaign is protracted, the resources of the State\r\nwill not be equal to the strain.\r\n\r\n4. Now, when your weapons are dulled, your ardour damped, your strength\r\nexhausted and your treasure spent, other chieftains will spring up to\r\ntake advantage of your extremity. Then no man, however wise, will be\r\nable to avert the consequences that must ensue.\r\n\r\n5. Thus, though we have heard of stupid haste in war, cleverness has\r\nnever been seen associated with long delays.\r\n\r\n[This concise and difficult sentence is not well explained by any of\r\nthe commentators. Ts’ao Kung, Li Ch’uan, Meng Shih, Tu Yu, Tu Mu and\r\nMei Yao-ch’en have notes to the effect that a general, though naturally\r\nstupid, may nevertheless conquer through sheer force of rapidity. Ho\r\nShih says: \"Haste may be stupid, but at any rate it saves expenditure\r\nof energy and treasure; protracted operations may be very clever, but\r\nthey bring calamity in their train.\" Wang Hsi evades the difficulty by\r\nremarking: \"Lengthy operations mean an army growing old, wealth being\r\nexpended, an empty exchequer and distress among the people; true\r\ncleverness insures against the occurrence of such calamities.\" Chang Yu\r\nsays: \"So long as victory can be attained, stupid haste is preferable\r\nto clever dilatoriness.\" Now Sun Tzŭ says nothing whatever, except\r\npossibly by implication, about ill-considered haste being better than\r\ningenious but lengthy operations. What he does say is something much\r\nmore guarded, namely that, while speed may sometimes be injudicious,\r\ntardiness can never be anything but foolish—if only because it means\r\nimpoverishment to the nation. In considering the point raised here by\r\nSun Tzŭ, the classic example of Fabius Cunctator will inevitably occur\r\nto the mind. That general deliberately measured the endurance of Rome\r\nagainst that of Hannibals’s isolated army, because it seemed to him\r\nthat the latter was more likely to suffer from a long campaign in a\r\nstrange country. But it is quite a moot question whether his tactics\r\nwould have proved successful in the long run. Their reversal it is\r\ntrue, led to Cannae; but this only establishes a negative presumption\r\nin their favour.]\r\n\r\n\r\n6. There is no instance of a country having benefited from prolonged\r\nwarfare.\r\n\r\n7. It is only one who is thoroughly acquainted with the evils of war\r\nthat can thoroughly understand the profitable way of carrying it on.\r\n\r\n[That is, with rapidity. Only one who knows the disastrous effects of a\r\nlong war can realize the supreme importance of rapidity in bringing it\r\nto a close. Only two commentators seem to favour this interpretation,\r\nbut it fits well into the logic of the context, whereas the rendering,\r\n\"He who does not know the evils of war cannot appreciate its benefits,\"\r\nis distinctly pointless.]\r\n\r\n\r\n8. The skilful soldier does not raise a second levy, neither are his\r\nsupply-waggons loaded more than twice.\r\n\r\n[Once war is declared, he will not waste precious time in waiting for\r\nreinforcements, nor will he return his army back for fresh supplies,\r\nbut crosses the enemy’s frontier without delay. This may seem an\r\naudacious policy to recommend, but with all great strategists, from\r\nJulius Caesar to Napoleon Bonaparte, the value of time—that is, being a\r\nlittle ahead of your opponent—has counted for more than either\r\nnumerical superiority or the nicest calculations with regard to\r\ncommissariat.]\r\n\r\n\r\n9. Bring war material with you from home, but forage on the enemy. Thus\r\nthe army will have food enough for its needs.\r\n\r\n[The Chinese word translated here as \"war material\" literally means\r\n\"things to be used\", and is meant in the widest sense. It includes all\r\nthe impedimenta of an army, apart from provisions.]\r\n\r\n\r\n10. Poverty of the State exchequer causes an army to be maintained by\r\ncontributions from a distance. Contributing to maintain an army at a\r\ndistance causes the people to be impoverished.\r\n\r\n[The beginning of this sentence does not balance properly with the\r\nnext, though obviously intended to do so. The arrangement, moreover, is\r\nso awkward that I cannot help suspecting some corruption in the text.\r\nIt never seems to occur to Chinese commentators that an emendation may\r\nbe necessary for the sense, and we get no help from them there. The\r\nChinese words Sun Tzŭ used to indicate the cause of the people’s\r\nimpoverishment clearly have reference to some system by which the\r\nhusbandmen sent their contributions of corn to the army direct. But why\r\nshould it fall on them to maintain an army in this way, except because\r\nthe State or Government is too poor to do so?]\r\n\r\n\r\n11. On the other hand, the proximity of an army causes prices to go up;\r\nand high prices cause the people’s substance to be drained away.\r\n\r\n[Wang Hsi says high prices occur before the army has left its own\r\nterritory. Ts’ao Kung understands it of an army that has already\r\ncrossed the frontier.]\r\n\r\n\r\n12. When their substance is drained away, the peasantry will be\r\nafflicted by heavy exactions.\r\n\r\n13, 14. With this loss of substance and exhaustion of strength, the\r\nhomes of the people will be stripped bare, and three-tenths of their\r\nincomes will be dissipated;\r\n\r\n[Tu Mu and Wang Hsi agree that the people are not mulcted not of 3/10,\r\nbut of 7/10, of their income. But this is hardly to be extracted from\r\nour text. Ho Shih has a characteristic tag: \"The _people_ being\r\nregarded as the essential part of the State, and _food_ as the people’s\r\nheaven, is it not right that those in authority should value and be\r\ncareful of both?\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nwhile Government expenses for broken chariots, worn-out horses,\r\nbreast-plates and helmets, bows and arrows, spears and shields,\r\nprotective mantlets, draught-oxen and heavy waggons, will amount to\r\nfour-tenths of its total revenue.\r\n\r\n15. Hence a wise general makes a point of foraging on the enemy. One\r\ncartload of the enemy’s provisions is equivalent to twenty of one’s\r\nown, and likewise a single _picul_ of his provender is equivalent to\r\ntwenty from one’s own store.\r\n\r\n[Because twenty cartloads will be consumed in the process of\r\ntransporting one cartload to the front. A _picul_ is a unit of measure\r\nequal to 133.3 pounds (65.5 kilograms).]\r\n\r\n\r\n16. Now in order to kill the enemy, our men must be roused to anger;\r\nthat there may be advantage from defeating the enemy, they must have\r\ntheir rewards.\r\n\r\n[Tu Mu says: \"Rewards are necessary in order to make the soldiers see\r\nthe advantage of beating the enemy; thus, when you capture spoils from\r\nthe enemy, they must be used as rewards, so that all your men may have\r\na keen desire to fight, each on his own account.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n17. Therefore in chariot fighting, when ten or more chariots have been\r\ntaken, those should be rewarded who took the first. Our own flags\r\nshould be substituted for those of the enemy, and the chariots mingled\r\nand used in conjunction with ours. The captured soldiers should be\r\nkindly treated and kept.\r\n\r\n18. This is called, using the conquered foe to augment one’s own\r\nstrength.\r\n\r\n19. In war, then, let your great object be victory, not lengthy\r\ncampaigns.\r\n\r\n[As Ho Shih remarks: \"War is not a thing to be trifled with.\" Sun Tzŭ\r\nhere reiterates the main lesson which this chapter is intended to\r\nenforce.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n20. Thus it may be known that the leader of armies is the arbiter of\r\nthe people’s fate, the man on whom it depends whether the nation shall\r\nbe in peace or in peril.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter III. ATTACK BY STRATAGEM\r\n\r\n1. Sun Tzŭ said: In the practical art of war, the best thing of all is\r\nto take the enemy’s country whole and intact; to shatter and destroy it\r\nis not so good. So, too, it is better to capture an army entire than\r\nto destroy it, to capture a regiment, a detachment or a company entire\r\nthan to destroy them.\r\n\r\n[The equivalent to an army corps, according to Ssu-ma Fa, consisted\r\nnominally of 12500 men; according to Ts’ao Kung, the equivalent of a\r\nregiment contained 500 men, the equivalent to a detachment consists\r\nfrom any number between 100 and 500, and the equivalent of a company\r\ncontains from 5 to 100 men. For the last two, however, Chang Yu gives\r\nthe exact figures of 100 and 5 respectively.]\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Hence to fight and conquer in all your battles is not supreme\r\nexcellence; supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy’s\r\nresistance without fighting.\r\n\r\n[Here again, no modern strategist but will approve the words of the old\r\nChinese general. Moltke’s greatest triumph, the capitulation of the\r\nhuge French army at Sedan, was won practically without bloodshed.]\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Thus the highest form of generalship is to baulk the enemy’s plans;\r\n\r\n[Perhaps the word \"balk\" falls short of expressing the full force of\r\nthe Chinese word, which implies not an attitude of defence, whereby one\r\nmight be content to foil the enemy’s stratagems one after another, but\r\nan active policy of counter-attack. Ho Shih puts this very clearly in\r\nhis note: \"When the enemy has made a plan of attack against us, we must\r\nanticipate him by delivering our own attack first.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nthe next best is to prevent the junction of the enemy’s forces;\r\n\r\n[Isolating him from his allies. We must not forget that Sun Tzŭ, in\r\nspeaking of hostilities, always has in mind the numerous states or\r\nprincipalities into which the China of his day was split up.]\r\n\r\n\r\nthe next in order is to attack the enemy’s army in the field;\r\n\r\n[When he is already at full strength.]\r\n\r\n\r\nand the worst policy of all is to besiege walled cities.\r\n\r\n4. The rule is, not to besiege walled cities if it can possibly be\r\navoided.\r\n\r\n[Another sound piece of military theory. Had the Boers acted upon it in\r\n1899, and refrained from dissipating their strength before Kimberley,\r\nMafeking, or even Ladysmith, it is more than probable that they would\r\nhave been masters of the situation before the British were ready\r\nseriously to oppose them.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe preparation of mantlets, movable shelters, and various implements\r\nof war, will take up three whole months;\r\n\r\n[It is not quite clear what the Chinese word, here translated as\r\n\"mantlets\", described. Ts’ao Kung simply defines them as \"large\r\nshields,\" but we get a better idea of them from Li Ch’uan, who says\r\nthey were to protect the heads of those who were assaulting the city\r\nwalls at close quarters. This seems to suggest a sort of Roman\r\n_testudo_, ready made. Tu Mu says they were wheeled vehicles used in\r\nrepelling attacks, but this is denied by Ch’en Hao. See _supra_ II. 14.\r\nThe name is also applied to turrets on city walls. Of the \"movable\r\nshelters\" we get a fairly clear description from several commentators.\r\nThey were wooden missile-proof structures on four wheels, propelled\r\nfrom within, covered over with raw hides, and used in sieges to convey\r\nparties of men to and from the walls, for the purpose of filling up the\r\nencircling moat with earth. Tu Mu adds that they are now called \"wooden\r\ndonkeys.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nand the piling up of mounds over against the walls will take three\r\nmonths more.\r\n\r\n[These were great mounds or ramparts of earth heaped up to the level of\r\nthe enemy’s walls in order to discover the weak points in the defence,\r\nand also to destroy the fortified turrets mentioned in the preceding\r\nnote.]\r\n\r\n\r\n5. The general, unable to control his irritation, will launch his men\r\nto the assault like swarming ants,\r\n\r\n[This vivid simile of Ts’ao Kung is taken from the spectacle of an army\r\nof ants climbing a wall. The meaning is that the general, losing\r\npatience at the long delay, may make a premature attempt to storm the\r\nplace before his engines of war are ready.]\r\n\r\n\r\nwith the result that one-third of his men are slain, while the town\r\nstill remains untaken. Such are the disastrous effects of a siege.\r\n\r\n[We are reminded of the terrible losses of the Japanese before Port\r\nArthur, in the most recent siege which history has to record.]\r\n\r\n\r\n6. Therefore the skilful leader subdues the enemy’s troops without any\r\nfighting; he captures their cities without laying siege to them; he\r\noverthrows their kingdom without lengthy operations in the field.\r\n\r\n[Chia Lin notes that he only overthrows the Government, but does no\r\nharm to individuals. The classical instance is Wu Wang, who after\r\nhaving put an end to the Yin dynasty was acclaimed \"Father and mother\r\nof the people.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n7. With his forces intact he will dispute the mastery of the Empire,\r\nand thus, without losing a man, his triumph will be complete.\r\n\r\n[Owing to the double meanings in the Chinese text, the latter part of\r\nthe sentence is susceptible of quite a different meaning: \"And thus,\r\nthe weapon not being blunted by use, its keenness remains perfect.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the method of attacking by stratagem.\r\n\r\n8. It is the rule in war, if our forces are ten to the enemy’s one, to\r\nsurround him; if five to one, to attack him;\r\n\r\n[Straightway, without waiting for any further advantage.]\r\n\r\n\r\nif twice as numerous, to divide our army into two.\r\n\r\n[Tu Mu takes exception to the saying; and at first sight, indeed, it\r\nappears to violate a fundamental principle of war. Ts’ao Kung, however,\r\ngives a clue to Sun Tzŭ’s meaning: \"Being two to the enemy’s one, we\r\nmay use one part of our army in the regular way, and the other for some\r\nspecial diversion.\" Chang Yu thus further elucidates the point: \"If our\r\nforce is twice as numerous as that of the enemy, it should be split up\r\ninto two divisions, one to meet the enemy in front, and one to fall\r\nupon his rear; if he replies to the frontal attack, he may be crushed\r\nfrom behind; if to the rearward attack, he may be crushed in front.\"\r\nThis is what is meant by saying that ‘one part may be used in the\r\nregular way, and the other for some special diversion.’ Tu Mu does not\r\nunderstand that dividing one’s army is simply an irregular, just as\r\nconcentrating it is the regular, strategical method, and he is too\r\nhasty in calling this a mistake.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n9. If equally matched, we can offer battle;\r\n\r\n[Li Ch’uan, followed by Ho Shih, gives the following paraphrase: \"If\r\nattackers and attacked are equally matched in strength, only the able\r\ngeneral will fight.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nif slightly inferior in numbers, we can avoid the enemy;\r\n\r\n[The meaning, \"we can _watch_ the enemy,\" is certainly a great\r\nimprovement on the above; but unfortunately there appears to be no very\r\ngood authority for the variant. Chang Yu reminds us that the saying\r\nonly applies if the other factors are equal; a small difference in\r\nnumbers is often more than counterbalanced by superior energy and\r\ndiscipline.]\r\n\r\n\r\nif quite unequal in every way, we can flee from him.\r\n\r\n10. Hence, though an obstinate fight may be made by a small force, in\r\nthe end it must be captured by the larger force.\r\n\r\n11. Now the general is the bulwark of the State: if the bulwark is\r\ncomplete at all points; the State will be strong; if the bulwark is\r\ndefective, the State will be weak.\r\n\r\n[As Li Ch’uan tersely puts it: \"Gap indicates deficiency; if the\r\ngeneral’s ability is not perfect (i.e. if he is not thoroughly versed\r\nin his profession), his army will lack strength.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n12. There are three ways in which a ruler can bring misfortune upon his\r\narmy:—\r\n\r\n13. (1) By commanding the army to advance or to retreat, being ignorant\r\nof the fact that it cannot obey. This is called hobbling the army.\r\n\r\n[Li Ch’uan adds the comment: \"It is like tying together the legs of a\r\nthoroughbred, so that it is unable to gallop.\" One would naturally\r\nthink of \"the ruler\" in this passage as being at home, and trying to\r\ndirect the movements of his army from a distance. But the commentators\r\nunderstand just the reverse, and quote the saying of T’ai Kung: \"A\r\nkingdom should not be governed from without, and army should not be\r\ndirected from within.\" Of course it is true that, during an engagement,\r\nor when in close touch with the enemy, the general should not be in the\r\nthick of his own troops, but a little distance apart. Otherwise, he\r\nwill be liable to misjudge the position as a whole, and give wrong\r\norders.]\r\n\r\n\r\n14. (2) By attempting to govern an army in the same way as he\r\nadministers a kingdom, being ignorant of the conditions which obtain in\r\nan army. This causes restlessness in the soldier’s minds.\r\n\r\n[Ts’ao Kung’s note is, freely translated: \"The military sphere and the\r\ncivil sphere are wholly distinct; you can’t handle an army in kid\r\ngloves.\" And Chang Yu says: \"Humanity and justice are the principles on\r\nwhich to govern a state, but not an army; opportunism and flexibility,\r\non the other hand, are military rather than civil virtues to assimilate\r\nthe governing of an army\"—to that of a State, understood.]\r\n\r\n\r\n15. (3) By employing the officers of his army without discrimination,\r\n\r\n[That is, he is not careful to use the right man in the right place.]\r\n\r\n\r\nthrough ignorance of the military principle of adaptation to\r\ncircumstances. This shakes the confidence of the soldiers.\r\n\r\n[I follow Mei Yao-ch’en here. The other commentators refer not to the\r\nruler, as in §§ 13, 14, but to the officers he employs. Thus Tu Yu\r\nsays: \"If a general is ignorant of the principle of adaptability, he\r\nmust not be entrusted with a position of authority.\" Tu Mu quotes: \"The\r\nskilful employer of men will employ the wise man, the brave man, the\r\ncovetous man, and the stupid man. For the wise man delights in\r\nestablishing his merit, the brave man likes to show his courage in\r\naction, the covetous man is quick at seizing advantages, and the stupid\r\nman has no fear of death.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n16. But when the army is restless and distrustful, trouble is sure to\r\ncome from the other feudal princes. This is simply bringing anarchy\r\ninto the army, and flinging victory away.\r\n\r\n17. Thus we may know that there are five essentials for victory: (1) He\r\nwill win who knows when to fight and when not to fight.\r\n\r\n[Chang Yu says: If he can fight, he advances and takes the offensive;\r\nif he cannot fight, he retreats and remains on the defensive. He will\r\ninvariably conquer who knows whether it is right to take the offensive\r\nor the defensive.]\r\n\r\n\r\n(2) He will win who knows how to handle both superior and inferior\r\nforces.\r\n\r\n[This is not merely the general’s ability to estimate numbers\r\ncorrectly, as Li Ch’uan and others make out. Chang Yu expounds the\r\nsaying more satisfactorily: \"By applying the art of war, it is possible\r\nwith a lesser force to defeat a greater, and _vice versa_. The secret\r\nlies in an eye for locality, and in not letting the right moment slip.\r\nThus Wu Tzŭ says: ‘With a superior force, make for easy ground; with an\r\ninferior one, make for difficult ground.’\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n(3) He will win whose army is animated by the same spirit throughout\r\nall its ranks.\r\n\r\n(4) He will win who, prepared himself, waits to take the enemy\r\nunprepared.\r\n\r\n(5) He will win who has military capacity and is not interfered with by\r\nthe sovereign.\r\n\r\n[Tu Yu quotes Wang Tzŭ as saying: \"It is the sovereign’s function to\r\ngive broad instructions, but to decide on battle it is the function of\r\nthe general.\" It is needless to dilate on the military disasters which\r\nhave been caused by undue interference with operations in the field on\r\nthe part of the home government. Napoleon undoubtedly owed much of his\r\nextraordinary success to the fact that he was not hampered by central\r\nauthority.]\r\n\r\nVictory lies in the knowledge of these five points.\r\n\r\n[Literally, “These five things are knowledge of the principle of\r\nvictory.”]\r\n\r\n18. Hence the saying: If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need\r\nnot fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not\r\nthe enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat.\r\n\r\n[Li Ch’uan cites the case of Fu Chien, prince of Ch’in, who in 383 A.D.\r\nmarched with a vast army against the Chin Emperor. When warned not to\r\ndespise an enemy who could command the services of such men as Hsieh An\r\nand Huan Ch’ung, he boastfully replied: \"I have the population of eight\r\nprovinces at my back, infantry and horsemen to the number of one\r\nmillion; why, they could dam up the Yangtsze River itself by merely\r\nthrowing their whips into the stream. What danger have I to fear?\"\r\nNevertheless, his forces were soon after disastrously routed at the Fei\r\nRiver, and he was obliged to beat a hasty retreat.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every\r\nbattle.\r\n\r\n[Chang Yu said: \"Knowing the enemy enables you to take the offensive,\r\nknowing yourself enables you to stand on the defensive.\" He adds:\r\n\"Attack is the secret of defence; defence is the planning of an\r\nattack.\" It would be hard to find a better epitome of the\r\nroot-principle of war.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IV. TACTICAL DISPOSITIONS\r\n\r\n[Ts’ao Kung explains the Chinese meaning of the words for the title of\r\nthis chapter: \"marching and countermarching on the part of the two\r\narmies with a view to discovering each other’s condition.\" Tu Mu says:\r\n\"It is through the dispositions of an army that its condition may be\r\ndiscovered. Conceal your dispositions, and your condition will remain\r\nsecret, which leads to victory; show your dispositions, and your\r\ncondition will become patent, which leads to defeat.\" Wang Hsi remarks\r\nthat the good general can \"secure success by modifying his tactics to\r\nmeet those of the enemy.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Sun Tzŭ said: The good fighters of old first put themselves beyond\r\nthe possibility of defeat, and then waited for an opportunity of\r\ndefeating the enemy.\r\n\r\n2. To secure ourselves against defeat lies in our own hands, but the\r\nopportunity of defeating the enemy is provided by the enemy himself.\r\n\r\n[That is, of course, by a mistake on the enemy’s part.]\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Thus the good fighter is able to secure himself against defeat,\r\n\r\n[Chang Yu says this is done, \"By concealing the disposition of his\r\ntroops, covering up his tracks, and taking unremitting precautions.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nbut cannot make certain of defeating the enemy.\r\n\r\n4. Hence the saying: One may _know_ how to conquer without being able\r\nto _do_ it.\r\n\r\n5. Security against defeat implies defensive tactics; ability to defeat\r\nthe enemy means taking the offensive.\r\n\r\n[I retain the sense found in a similar passage in §§ 1-3, in spite of\r\nthe fact that the commentators are all against me. The meaning they\r\ngive, \"He who cannot conquer takes the defensive,\" is plausible\r\nenough.]\r\n\r\n\r\n6. Standing on the defensive indicates insufficient strength;\r\nattacking, a superabundance of strength.\r\n\r\n7. The general who is skilled in defence hides in the most secret\r\nrecesses of the earth;\r\n\r\n[Literally, \"hides under the ninth earth,\" which is a metaphor\r\nindicating the utmost secrecy and concealment, so that the enemy may\r\nnot know his whereabouts.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nhe who is skilled in attack flashes forth from the topmost heights of\r\nheaven.\r\n\r\n[Another metaphor, implying that he falls on his adversary like a\r\nthunderbolt, against which there is no time to prepare. This is the\r\nopinion of most of the commentators.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThus on the one hand we have ability to protect ourselves; on the\r\nother, a victory that is complete.\r\n\r\n8. To see victory only when it is within the ken of the common herd is\r\nnot the acme of excellence.\r\n\r\n[As Ts’ao Kung remarks, \"the thing is to see the plant before it has\r\ngerminated,\" to foresee the event before the action has begun. Li\r\nCh’uan alludes to the story of Han Hsin who, when about to attack the\r\nvastly superior army of Chao, which was strongly entrenched in the city\r\nof Ch’eng-an, said to his officers: \"Gentlemen, we are going to\r\nannihilate the enemy, and shall meet again at dinner.\" The officers\r\nhardly took his words seriously, and gave a very dubious assent. But\r\nHan Hsin had already worked out in his mind the details of a clever\r\nstratagem, whereby, as he foresaw, he was able to capture the city and\r\ninflict a crushing defeat on his adversary.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n9. Neither is it the acme of excellence if you fight and conquer and\r\nthe whole Empire says, \"Well done!\"\r\n\r\n[True excellence being, as Tu Mu says: \"To plan secretly, to move\r\nsurreptitiously, to foil the enemy’s intentions and balk his schemes,\r\nso that at last the day may be won without shedding a drop of blood.\"\r\nSun Tzŭ reserves his approbation for things that\r\n\r\n\r\n\"the world’s coarse thumb\r\nAnd finger fail to plumb.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n10. To lift an autumn hair is no sign of great strength;\r\n\r\n[\"Autumn hair\" is explained as the fur of a hare, which is finest in\r\nautumn, when it begins to grow afresh. The phrase is a very common one\r\nin Chinese writers.]\r\n\r\n\r\nto see sun and moon is no sign of sharp sight; to hear the noise of\r\nthunder is no sign of a quick ear.\r\n\r\n[Ho Shih gives as real instances of strength, sharp sight and quick\r\nhearing: Wu Huo, who could lift a tripod weighing 250 stone; Li Chu,\r\nwho at a distance of a hundred paces could see objects no bigger than a\r\nmustard seed; and Shih K’uang, a blind musician who could hear the\r\nfootsteps of a mosquito.]\r\n\r\n\r\n11. What the ancients called a clever fighter is one who not only wins,\r\nbut excels in winning with ease.\r\n\r\n[The last half is literally \"one who, conquering, excels in easy\r\nconquering.\" Mei Yao-ch’en says: \"He who only sees the obvious, wins\r\nhis battles with difficulty; he who looks below the surface of things,\r\nwins with ease.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n12. Hence his victories bring him neither reputation for wisdom nor\r\ncredit for courage.\r\n\r\n[Tu Mu explains this very well: \"Inasmuch as his victories are gained\r\nover circumstances that have not come to light, the world as large\r\nknows nothing of them, and he wins no reputation for wisdom; inasmuch\r\nas the hostile state submits before there has been any bloodshed, he\r\nreceives no credit for courage.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n13. He wins his battles by making no mistakes.\r\n\r\n[Ch’en Hao says: \"He plans no superfluous marches, he devises no futile\r\nattacks.\" The connection of ideas is thus explained by Chang Yu: \"One\r\nwho seeks to conquer by sheer strength, clever though he may be at\r\nwinning pitched battles, is also liable on occasion to be vanquished;\r\nwhereas he who can look into the future and discern conditions that are\r\nnot yet manifest, will never make a blunder and therefore invariably\r\nwin.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nMaking no mistakes is what establishes the certainty of victory, for it\r\nmeans conquering an enemy that is already defeated.\r\n\r\n14. Hence the skilful fighter puts himself into a position which makes\r\ndefeat impossible, and does not miss the moment for defeating the\r\nenemy.\r\n\r\n[A \"counsel of perfection\" as Tu Mu truly observes. \"Position\" need not\r\nbe confined to the actual ground occupied by the troops. It includes\r\nall the arrangements and preparations which a wise general will make to\r\nincrease the safety of his army.]\r\n\r\n\r\n15. Thus it is that in war the victorious strategist only seeks battle\r\nafter the victory has been won, whereas he who is destined to defeat\r\nfirst fights and afterwards looks for victory.\r\n\r\n[Ho Shih thus expounds the paradox: \"In warfare, first lay plans which\r\nwill ensure victory, and then lead your army to battle; if you will not\r\nbegin with stratagem but rely on brute strength alone, victory will no\r\nlonger be assured.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n16. The consummate leader cultivates the moral law, and strictly\r\nadheres to method and discipline; thus it is in his power to control\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\n17. In respect of military method, we have, firstly, Measurement;\r\nsecondly, Estimation of quantity; thirdly, Calculation; fourthly,\r\nBalancing of chances; fifthly, Victory.\r\n\r\n18. Measurement owes its existence to Earth; Estimation of quantity to\r\nMeasurement; Calculation to Estimation of quantity; Balancing of\r\nchances to Calculation; and Victory to Balancing of chances.\r\n\r\n[It is not easy to distinguish the four terms very clearly in the\r\nChinese. The first seems to be surveying and measurement of the ground,\r\nwhich enable us to form an estimate of the enemy’s strength, and to\r\nmake calculations based on the data thus obtained; we are thus led to a\r\ngeneral weighing-up, or comparison of the enemy’s chances with our own;\r\nif the latter turn the scale, then victory ensues. The chief difficulty\r\nlies in third term, which in the Chinese some commentators take as a\r\ncalculation of _numbers_, thereby making it nearly synonymous with the\r\nsecond term. Perhaps the second term should be thought of as a\r\nconsideration of the enemy’s general position or condition, while the\r\nthird term is the estimate of his numerical strength. On the other\r\nhand, Tu Mu says: \"The question of relative strength having been\r\nsettled, we can bring the varied resources of cunning into play.\" Ho\r\nShih seconds this interpretation, but weakens it. However, it points to\r\nthe third term as being a calculation of numbers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n19. A victorious army opposed to a routed one, is as a pound’s weight\r\nplaced in the scale against a single grain.\r\n\r\n[Literally, \"a victorious army is like an _i_ (20 oz.) weighed against\r\na _shu_ (1/24 oz.); a routed army is a _shu_ weighed against an _i_.\"\r\nThe point is simply the enormous advantage which a disciplined force,\r\nflushed with victory, has over one demoralized by defeat. Legge, in his\r\nnote on Mencius, I. 2. ix. 2, makes the _i_ to be 24 Chinese ounces,\r\nand corrects Chu Hsi’s statement that it equaled 20 oz. only. But Li\r\nCh’uan of the T’ang dynasty here gives the same figure as Chu Hsi.]\r\n\r\n\r\n20. The onrush of a conquering force is like the bursting of pent-up\r\nwaters into a chasm a thousand fathoms deep. So much for tactical\r\ndispositions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter V. ENERGY\r\n\r\n1. Sun Tzŭ said: The control of a large force is the same principle as\r\nthe control of a few men: it is merely a question of dividing up their\r\nnumbers.\r\n\r\n[That is, cutting up the army into regiments, companies, etc., with\r\nsubordinate officers in command of each. Tu Mu reminds us of Han Hsin’s\r\nfamous reply to the first Han Emperor, who once said to him: \"How large\r\nan army do you think I could lead?\" \"Not more than 100,000 men, your\r\nMajesty.\" \"And you?\" asked the Emperor. \"Oh!\" he answered, \"the more\r\nthe better.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Fighting with a large army under your command is nowise different\r\nfrom fighting with a small one: it is merely a question of instituting\r\nsigns and signals.\r\n\r\n3. To ensure that your whole host may withstand the brunt of the\r\nenemy’s attack and remain unshaken—this is effected by manœuvers direct\r\nand indirect.\r\n\r\n[We now come to one of the most interesting parts of Sun Tzŭ’s\r\ntreatise, the discussion of the _cheng_ and the _ch’i_.\" As it is by no\r\nmeans easy to grasp the full significance of these two terms, or to\r\nrender them consistently by good English equivalents; it may be as well\r\nto tabulate some of the commentators’ remarks on the subject before\r\nproceeding further. Li Ch’uan: \"Facing the enemy is _cheng_, making\r\nlateral diversion is _ch’i_. Chia Lin: \"In presence of the enemy, your\r\ntroops should be arrayed in normal fashion, but in order to secure\r\nvictory abnormal manœuvers must be employed.\" Mei Yao-ch’en: \"_Ch’i_ is\r\nactive, _cheng_ is passive; passivity means waiting for an opportunity,\r\nactivity brings the victory itself.\" Ho Shih: \"We must cause the enemy\r\nto regard our straightforward attack as one that is secretly designed,\r\nand vice versa; thus _cheng_ may also be _ch’i_, and _ch’i_ may also be\r\n_cheng_.\" He instances the famous exploit of Han Hsin, who when\r\nmarching ostensibly against Lin-chin (now Chao-i in Shensi), suddenly\r\nthrew a large force across the Yellow River in wooden tubs, utterly\r\ndisconcerting his opponent. [Ch’ien Han Shu, ch. 3.] Here, we are told,\r\nthe march on Lin-chin was _cheng_, and the surprise manœuver was\r\n_ch’i_.\" Chang Yu gives the following summary of opinions on the words:\r\n\"Military writers do not agree with regard to the meaning of _ch’i_ and\r\n_cheng_. Wei Liao Tzŭ [4th cent. B.C.] says: ‘Direct warfare favours\r\nfrontal attacks, indirect warfare attacks from the rear.’ Ts’ao Kung\r\nsays: ‘Going straight out to join battle is a direct operation;\r\nappearing on the enemy’s rear is an indirect manœuver.’ Li Wei-kung\r\n[6th and 7th cent. A.D.] says: ‘In war, to march straight ahead is\r\n_cheng_; turning movements, on the other hand, are _ch’i_.’ These\r\nwriters simply regard _cheng_ as _cheng_, and _ch’i_ as _ch’i_; they do\r\nnot note that the two are mutually interchangeable and run into each\r\nother like the two sides of a circle [see infra, § 11]. A comment on\r\nthe T’ang Emperor T’ai Tsung goes to the root of the matter: ‘A _ch’i_\r\nmanœuver may be _cheng_, if we make the enemy look upon it as _cheng_;\r\nthen our real attack will be _ch’i_, and vice versa. The whole secret\r\nlies in confusing the enemy, so that he cannot fathom our real\r\nintent.’\" To put it perhaps a little more clearly: any attack or other\r\noperation is _cheng_, on which the enemy has had his attention fixed;\r\nwhereas that is _ch’i_,\" which takes him by surprise or comes from an\r\nunexpected quarter. If the enemy perceives a movement which is meant to\r\nbe _ch’i_,\" it immediately becomes _cheng_.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n4. That the impact of your army may be like a grindstone dashed against\r\nan egg—this is effected by the science of weak points and strong.\r\n\r\n5. In all fighting, the direct method may be used for joining battle,\r\nbut indirect methods will be needed in order to secure victory.\r\n\r\n[Chang Yu says: \"Steadily develop indirect tactics, either by pounding\r\nthe enemy’s flanks or falling on his rear.\" A brilliant example of\r\n\"indirect tactics\" which decided the fortunes of a campaign was Lord\r\nRoberts’ night march round the Peiwar Kotal in the second Afghan war.\r\n[1]\r\n\r\n\r\n6. Indirect tactics, efficiently applied, are inexhausible as Heaven\r\nand Earth, unending as the flow of rivers and streams; like the sun and\r\nmoon, they end but to begin anew; like the four seasons, they pass away\r\nbut to return once more.\r\n\r\n[Tu Yu and Chang Yu understand this of the permutations of _ch’i_ and\r\n_cheng_. But at present Sun Tzŭ is not speaking of _cheng_ at all,\r\nunless, indeed, we suppose with Cheng Yu-hsien that a clause relating\r\nto it has fallen out of the text. Of course, as has already been\r\npointed out, the two are so inextricably interwoven in all military\r\noperations, that they cannot really be considered apart. Here we simply\r\nhave an expression, in figurative language, of the almost infinite\r\nresource of a great leader.]\r\n\r\n\r\n7. There are not more than five musical notes, yet the combinations of\r\nthese five give rise to more melodies than can ever be heard.\r\n\r\n8. There are not more than five primary colours (blue, yellow, red,\r\nwhite, and black), yet in combination they produce more hues than can\r\never be seen.\r\n\r\n9 There are not more than five cardinal tastes (sour, acrid, salt,\r\nsweet, bitter), yet combinations of them yield more flavours than can\r\never be tasted.\r\n\r\n10. In battle, there are not more than two methods of attack—the direct\r\nand the indirect; yet these two in combination give rise to an endless\r\nseries of manœuvers.\r\n\r\n11. The direct and the indirect lead on to each other in turn. It is\r\nlike moving in a circle—you never come to an end. Who can exhaust the\r\npossibilities of their combination?\r\n\r\n12. The onset of troops is like the rush of a torrent which will even\r\nroll stones along in its course.\r\n\r\n13. The quality of decision is like the well-timed swoop of a falcon\r\nwhich enables it to strike and destroy its victim.\r\n\r\n[The Chinese here is tricky and a certain key word in the context it is\r\nused defies the best efforts of the translator. Tu Mu defines this word\r\nas \"the measurement or estimation of distance.\" But this meaning does\r\nnot quite fit the illustrative simile in §. 15. Applying this\r\ndefinition to the falcon, it seems to me to denote that instinct of\r\n_self-restraint_ which keeps the bird from swooping on its quarry until\r\nthe right moment, together with the power of judging when the right\r\nmoment has arrived. The analogous quality in soldiers is the highly\r\nimportant one of being able to reserve their fire until the very\r\ninstant at which it will be most effective. When the \"Victory\" went\r\ninto action at Trafalgar at hardly more than drifting pace, she was for\r\nseveral minutes exposed to a storm of shot and shell before replying\r\nwith a single gun. Nelson coolly waited until he was within close\r\nrange, when the broadside he brought to bear worked fearful havoc on\r\nthe enemy’s nearest ships.]\r\n\r\n\r\n14. Therefore the good fighter will be terrible in his onset, and\r\nprompt in his decision.\r\n\r\n[The word \"decision\" would have reference to the measurement of\r\ndistance mentioned above, letting the enemy get near before striking.\r\nBut I cannot help thinking that Sun Tzŭ meant to use the word in a\r\nfigurative sense comparable to our own idiom \"short and sharp.\" Cf.\r\nWang Hsi’s note, which after describing the falcon’s mode of attack,\r\nproceeds: \"This is just how the ‘psychological moment’ should be seized\r\nin war.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n15. Energy may be likened to the bending of a crossbow; decision, to\r\nthe releasing of the trigger.\r\n\r\n[None of the commentators seem to grasp the real point of the simile of\r\nenergy and the force stored up in the bent cross-bow until released by\r\nthe finger on the trigger.]\r\n\r\n\r\n16. Amid the turmoil and tumult of battle, there may be seeming\r\ndisorder and yet no real disorder at all; amid confusion and chaos,\r\nyour array may be without head or tail, yet it will be proof against\r\ndefeat.\r\n\r\n[Mei Yao-ch’en says: \"The subdivisions of the army having been\r\npreviously fixed, and the various signals agreed upon, the separating\r\nand joining, the dispersing and collecting which will take place in the\r\ncourse of a battle, may give the appearance of disorder when no real\r\ndisorder is possible. Your formation may be without head or tail, your\r\ndispositions all topsy-turvy, and yet a rout of your forces quite out\r\nof the question.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n17. Simulated disorder postulates perfect discipline; simulated fear\r\npostulates courage; simulated weakness postulates strength.\r\n\r\n[In order to make the translation intelligible, it is necessary to tone\r\ndown the sharply paradoxical form of the original. Ts’ao Kung throws\r\nout a hint of the meaning in his brief note: \"These things all serve to\r\ndestroy formation and conceal one’s condition.\" But Tu Mu is the first\r\nto put it quite plainly: \"If you wish to feign confusion in order to\r\nlure the enemy on, you must first have perfect discipline; if you wish\r\nto display timidity in order to entrap the enemy, you must have extreme\r\ncourage; if you wish to parade your weakness in order to make the enemy\r\nover-confident, you must have exceeding strength.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n18. Hiding order beneath the cloak of disorder is simply a question of\r\nsubdivision;\r\n\r\n[See _supra_, § 1.]\r\n\r\n\r\nconcealing courage under a show of timidity presupposes a fund of\r\nlatent energy;\r\n\r\n[The commentators strongly understand a certain Chinese word here\r\ndifferently than anywhere else in this chapter. Thus Tu Mu says:\r\n\"seeing that we are favourably circumstanced and yet make no move, the\r\nenemy will believe that we are really afraid.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nmasking strength with weakness is to be effected by tactical\r\ndispositions.\r\n\r\n[Chang Yu relates the following anecdote of Kao Tsu, the first Han\r\nEmperor: “Wishing to crush the Hsiung-nu, he sent out spies to report\r\non their condition. But the Hsiung-nu, forewarned, carefully concealed\r\nall their able-bodied men and well-fed horses, and only allowed infirm\r\nsoldiers and emaciated cattle to be seen. The result was that spies one\r\nand all recommended the Emperor to deliver his attack. Lou Ching alone\r\nopposed them, saying: ‘When two countries go to war, they are naturally\r\ninclined to make an ostentatious display of their strength. Yet our\r\nspies have seen nothing but old age and infirmity. This is surely some\r\n_ruse_ on the part of the enemy, and it would be unwise for us to\r\nattack.’ The Emperor, however, disregarding this advice, fell into the\r\ntrap and found himself surrounded at Po-teng.”]\r\n\r\n\r\n19. Thus one who is skilful at keeping the enemy on the move maintains\r\ndeceitful appearances, according to which the enemy will act.\r\n\r\n[Ts’ao Kung’s note is \"Make a display of weakness and want.\" Tu Mu\r\nsays: \"If our force happens to be superior to the enemy’s, weakness may\r\nbe simulated in order to lure him on; but if inferior, he must be led\r\nto believe that we are strong, in order that he may keep off. In fact,\r\nall the enemy’s movements should be determined by the signs that we\r\nchoose to give him.\" Note the following anecdote of Sun Pin, a\r\ndescendent of Sun Wu: In 341 B.C., the Ch’i State being at war with\r\nWei, sent T’ien Chi and Sun Pin against the general P’ang Chuan, who\r\nhappened to be a deadly personal enemy of the later. Sun Pin said: \"The\r\nCh’i State has a reputation for cowardice, and therefore our adversary\r\ndespises us. Let us turn this circumstance to account.\" Accordingly,\r\nwhen the army had crossed the border into Wei territory, he gave orders\r\nto show 100,000 fires on the first night, 50,000 on the next, and the\r\nnight after only 20,000. P’ang Chuan pursued them hotly, saying to\r\nhimself: \"I knew these men of Ch’i were cowards: their numbers have\r\nalready fallen away by more than half.\" In his retreat, Sun Pin came to\r\na narrow defile, which he calculated that his pursuers would reach\r\nafter dark. Here he had a tree stripped of its bark, and inscribed upon\r\nit the words: \"Under this tree shall P’ang Chuan die.\" Then, as night\r\nbegan to fall, he placed a strong body of archers in ambush near by,\r\nwith orders to shoot directly if they saw a light. Later on, P’ang\r\nChuan arrived at the spot, and noticing the tree, struck a light in\r\norder to read what was written on it. His body was immediately riddled\r\nby a volley of arrows, and his whole army thrown into confusion. [The\r\nabove is Tu Mu’s version of the story; the _Shih Chi_, less\r\ndramatically but probably with more historical truth, makes P’ang Chuan\r\ncut his own throat with an exclamation of despair, after the rout of\r\nhis army.] ]\r\n\r\n\r\nHe sacrifices something, that the enemy may snatch at it.\r\n\r\n20. By holding out baits, he keeps him on the march; then with a body\r\nof picked men he lies in wait for him.\r\n\r\n[With an emendation suggested by Li Ching, this then reads, \"He lies in\r\nwait with the main body of his troops.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n21. The clever combatant looks to the effect of combined energy, and\r\ndoes not require too much from individuals.\r\n\r\n[Tu Mu says: \"He first of all considers the power of his army in the\r\nbulk; afterwards he takes individual talent into account, and uses each\r\nmen according to his capabilities. He does not demand perfection from\r\nthe untalented.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nHence his ability to pick out the right men and utilise combined\r\nenergy.\r\n\r\n22. When he utilises combined energy, his fighting men become as it\r\nwere like unto rolling logs or stones. For it is the nature of a log or\r\nstone to remain motionless on level ground, and to move when on a\r\nslope; if four-cornered, to come to a standstill, but if round-shaped,\r\nto go rolling down.\r\n\r\n[Ts’au Kung calls this \"the use of natural or inherent power.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n23. Thus the energy developed by good fighting men is as the momentum\r\nof a round stone rolled down a mountain thousands of feet in height. So\r\nmuch on the subject of energy.\r\n\r\n[The chief lesson of this chapter, in Tu Mu’s opinion, is the paramount\r\nimportance in war of rapid evolutions and sudden rushes. \"Great\r\nresults,\" he adds, \"can thus be achieved with small forces.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] \"Forty-one Years in India,\" chapter 46.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VI. WEAK POINTS AND STRONG\r\n\r\n[Chang Yu attempts to explain the sequence of chapters as follows:\r\n\"Chapter IV, on Tactical Dispositions, treated of the offensive and the\r\ndefensive; chapter V, on Energy, dealt with direct and indirect\r\nmethods. The good general acquaints himself first with the theory of\r\nattack and defence, and then turns his attention to direct and indirect\r\nmethods. He studies the art of varying and combining these two methods\r\nbefore proceeding to the subject of weak and strong points. For the use\r\nof direct or indirect methods arises out of attack and defence, and the\r\nperception of weak and strong points depends again on the above\r\nmethods. Hence the present chapter comes immediately after the chapter\r\non Energy.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Sun Tzŭ said: Whoever is first in the field and awaits the coming of\r\nthe enemy, will be fresh for the fight; whoever is second in the field\r\nand has to hasten to battle, will arrive exhausted.\r\n\r\n2. Therefore the clever combatant imposes his will on the enemy, but\r\ndoes not allow the enemy’s will to be imposed on him.\r\n\r\n[One mark of a great soldier is that he fight on his own terms or\r\nfights not at all. [1] ]\r\n\r\n\r\n3. By holding out advantages to him, he can cause the enemy to approach\r\nof his own accord; or, by inflicting damage, he can make it impossible\r\nfor the enemy to draw near.\r\n\r\n[In the first case, he will entice him with a bait; in the second, he\r\nwill strike at some important point which the enemy will have to\r\ndefend.]\r\n\r\n\r\n4. If the enemy is taking his ease, he can harass him;\r\n\r\n[This passage may be cited as evidence against Mei Yao- Ch’en’s\r\ninterpretation of I. § 23.]\r\n\r\n\r\nif well supplied with food, he can starve him out; if quietly encamped,\r\nhe can force him to move.\r\n\r\n5. Appear at points which the enemy must hasten to defend; march\r\nswiftly to places where you are not expected.\r\n\r\n6. An army may march great distances without distress, if it marches\r\nthrough country where the enemy is not.\r\n\r\n[Ts’ao Kung sums up very well: \"Emerge from the void [q.d. like \"a bolt\r\nfrom the blue\"], strike at vulnerable points, shun places that are\r\ndefended, attack in unexpected quarters.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n7. You can be sure of succeeding in your attacks if you only attack\r\nplaces which are undefended.\r\n\r\n[Wang Hsi explains \"undefended places\" as \"weak points; that is to say,\r\nwhere the general is lacking in capacity, or the soldiers in spirit;\r\nwhere the walls are not strong enough, or the precautions not strict\r\nenough; where relief comes too late, or provisions are too scanty, or\r\nthe defenders are variance amongst themselves.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can ensure the safety of your defence if you only hold positions\r\nthat cannot be attacked.\r\n\r\n[_I.e._, where there are none of the weak points mentioned above. There\r\nis rather a nice point involved in the interpretation of this later\r\nclause. Tu Mu, Ch’en Hao, and Mei Yao-ch’en assume the meaning to be:\r\n\"In order to make your defence quite safe, you must defend _even_ those\r\nplaces that are not likely to be attacked;\" and Tu Mu adds: \"How much\r\nmore, then, those that will be attacked.\" Taken thus, however, the\r\nclause balances less well with the preceding—always a consideration in\r\nthe highly antithetical style which is natural to the Chinese. Chang\r\nYu, therefore, seems to come nearer the mark in saying: \"He who is\r\nskilled in attack flashes forth from the topmost heights of heaven [see\r\nIV. § 7], making it impossible for the enemy to guard against him. This\r\nbeing so, the places that I shall attack are precisely those that the\r\nenemy cannot defend…. He who is skilled in defence hides in the most\r\nsecret recesses of the earth, making it impossible for the enemy to\r\nestimate his whereabouts. This being so, the places that I shall hold\r\nare precisely those that the enemy cannot attack.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n8. Hence that general is skilful in attack whose opponent does not\r\nknow what to defend; and he is skilful in defence whose opponent does\r\nnot know what to attack.\r\n\r\n[An aphorism which puts the whole art of war in a nutshell.]\r\n\r\n\r\n9. O divine art of subtlety and secrecy! Through you we learn to be\r\ninvisible, through you inaudible;\r\n\r\n[Literally, \"without form or sound,\" but it is said of course with\r\nreference to the enemy.]\r\n\r\n\r\nand hence we can hold the enemy’s fate in our hands.\r\n\r\n10. You may advance and be absolutely irresistible, if you make for the\r\nenemy’s weak points; you may retire and be safe from pursuit if your\r\nmovements are more rapid than those of the enemy.\r\n\r\n11. If we wish to fight, the enemy can be forced to an engagement even\r\nthough he be sheltered behind a high rampart and a deep ditch. All we\r\nneed do is attack some other place that he will be obliged to relieve.\r\n\r\n[Tu Mu says: \"If the enemy is the invading party, we can cut his line\r\nof communications and occupy the roads by which he will have to return;\r\nif we are the invaders, we may direct our attack against the sovereign\r\nhimself.\" It is clear that Sun Tzŭ, unlike certain generals in the late\r\nBoer war, was no believer in frontal attacks.]\r\n\r\n\r\n12. If we do not wish to fight, we can prevent the enemy from engaging\r\nus even though the lines of our encampment be merely traced out on the\r\nground. All we need do is to throw something odd and unaccountable in\r\nhis way.\r\n\r\n[This extremely concise expression is intelligibly paraphrased by Chia\r\nLin: \"even though we have constructed neither wall nor ditch.\" Li\r\nCh’uan says: \"we puzzle him by strange and unusual dispositions;\" and\r\nTu Mu finally clinches the meaning by three illustrative anecdotes—one\r\nof Chu-ko Liang, who when occupying Yang-p’ing and about to be attacked\r\nby Ssu-ma I, suddenly struck his colors, stopped the beating of the\r\ndrums, and flung open the city gates, showing only a few men engaged in\r\nsweeping and sprinkling the ground. This unexpected proceeding had the\r\nintended effect; for Ssu-ma I, suspecting an ambush, actually drew off\r\nhis army and retreated. What Sun Tzŭ is advocating here, therefore, is\r\nnothing more nor less than the timely use of \"bluff.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n13. By discovering the enemy’s dispositions and remaining invisible\r\nourselves, we can keep our forces concentrated, while the enemy’s must\r\nbe divided.\r\n\r\n[The conclusion is perhaps not very obvious, but Chang Yu (after Mei\r\nYao-ch’en) rightly explains it thus: \"If the enemy’s dispositions are\r\nvisible, we can make for him in one body; whereas, our own dispositions\r\nbeing kept secret, the enemy will be obliged to divide his forces in\r\norder to guard against attack from every quarter.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n14. We can form a single united body, while the enemy must split up\r\ninto fractions. Hence there will be a whole pitted against separate\r\nparts of a whole, which means that we shall be many to the enemy’s few.\r\n\r\n15. And if we are able thus to attack an inferior force with a superior\r\none, our opponents will be in dire straits.\r\n\r\n16. The spot where we intend to fight must not be made known; for then\r\nthe enemy will have to prepare against a possible attack at several\r\ndifferent points;\r\n\r\n[Sheridan once explained the reason of General Grant’s victories by\r\nsaying that \"while his opponents were kept fully employed wondering\r\nwhat he was going to do, _he_ was thinking most of what he was going to\r\ndo himself.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nand his forces being thus distributed in many directions, the numbers\r\nwe shall have to face at any given point will be proportionately few.\r\n\r\n17. For should the enemy strengthen his van, he will weaken his rear;\r\nshould he strengthen his rear, he will weaken his van; should he\r\nstrengthen his left, he will weaken his right; should he strengthen his\r\nright, he will weaken his left. If he sends reinforcements everywhere,\r\nhe will everywhere be weak.\r\n\r\n[In Frederick the Great’s _Instructions to his Generals_ we read: \"A\r\ndefensive war is apt to betray us into too frequent detachment. Those\r\ngenerals who have had but little experience attempt to protect every\r\npoint, while those who are better acquainted with their profession,\r\nhaving only the capital object in view, guard against a decisive blow,\r\nand acquiesce in small misfortunes to avoid greater.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n18. Numerical weakness comes from having to prepare against possible\r\nattacks; numerical strength, from compelling our adversary to make\r\nthese preparations against us.\r\n\r\n[The highest generalship, in Col. Henderson’s words, is \"to compel the\r\nenemy to disperse his army, and then to concentrate superior force\r\nagainst each fraction in turn.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n19. Knowing the place and the time of the coming battle, we may\r\nconcentrate from the greatest distances in order to fight.\r\n\r\n[What Sun Tzŭ evidently has in mind is that nice calculation of\r\ndistances and that masterly employment of strategy which enable a\r\ngeneral to divide his army for the purpose of a long and rapid march,\r\nand afterwards to effect a junction at precisely the right spot and the\r\nright hour in order to confront the enemy in overwhelming strength.\r\nAmong many such successful junctions which military history records,\r\none of the most dramatic and decisive was the appearance of Blucher\r\njust at the critical moment on the field of Waterloo.]\r\n\r\n\r\n20. But if neither time nor place be known, then the left wing will be\r\nimpotent to succour the right, the right equally impotent to succour the\r\nleft, the van unable to relieve the rear, or the rear to support the\r\nvan. How much more so if the furthest portions of the army are anything\r\nunder a hundred _li_ apart, and even the nearest are separated by\r\nseveral _li_!\r\n\r\n[The Chinese of this last sentence is a little lacking in precision,\r\nbut the mental picture we are required to draw is probably that of an\r\narmy advancing towards a given rendezvous in separate columns, each of\r\nwhich has orders to be there on a fixed date. If the general allows the\r\nvarious detachments to proceed at haphazard, without precise\r\ninstructions as to the time and place of meeting, the enemy will be\r\nable to annihilate the army in detail. Chang Yu’s note may be worth\r\nquoting here: \"If we do not know the place where our opponents mean to\r\nconcentrate or the day on which they will join battle, our unity will\r\nbe forfeited through our preparations for defence, and the positions we\r\nhold will be insecure. Suddenly happening upon a powerful foe, we shall\r\nbe brought to battle in a flurried condition, and no mutual support\r\nwill be possible between wings, vanguard or rear, especially if there\r\nis any great distance between the foremost and hindmost divisions of\r\nthe army.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n21. Though according to my estimate the soldiers of Yüeh exceed our own\r\nin number, that shall advantage them nothing in the matter of victory.\r\nI say then that victory can be achieved.\r\n\r\n[Alas for these brave words! The long feud between the two states ended\r\nin 473 B.C. with the total defeat of Wu by Kou Chien and its\r\nincorporation in Yüeh. This was doubtless long after Sun Tzŭ’s death.\r\nWith his present assertion compare IV. § 4. Chang Yu is the only one to\r\npoint out the seeming discrepancy, which he thus goes on to explain:\r\n\"In the chapter on Tactical Dispositions it is said, ‘One may _know_\r\nhow to conquer without being able to _do_ it,’ whereas here we have the\r\nstatement that ‘victory’ can be achieved.’ The explanation is, that in\r\nthe former chapter, where the offensive and defensive are under\r\ndiscussion, it is said that if the enemy is fully prepared, one cannot\r\nmake certain of beating him. But the present passage refers\r\nparticularly to the soldiers of Yüeh who, according to Sun Tzŭ’s\r\ncalculations, will be kept in ignorance of the time and place of the\r\nimpending struggle. That is why he says here that victory can be\r\nachieved.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n22. Though the enemy be stronger in numbers, we may prevent him from\r\nfighting. Scheme so as to discover his plans and the likelihood of\r\ntheir success.\r\n\r\n[An alternative reading offered by Chia Lin is: \"Know beforehand all\r\nplans conducive to our success and to the enemy’s failure.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n23. Rouse him, and learn the principle of his activity or inactivity.\r\n\r\n[Chang Yu tells us that by noting the joy or anger shown by the enemy\r\non being thus disturbed, we shall be able to conclude whether his\r\npolicy is to lie low or the reverse. He instances the action of Cho-ku\r\nLiang, who sent the scornful present of a woman’s head-dress to Ssu-ma\r\nI, in order to goad him out of his Fabian tactics.]\r\n\r\n\r\nForce him to reveal himself, so as to find out his vulnerable spots.\r\n\r\n24. Carefully compare the opposing army with your own, so that you may\r\nknow where strength is superabundant and where it is deficient.\r\n\r\n[Cf. IV. § 6.]\r\n\r\n\r\n25. In making tactical dispositions, the highest pitch you can attain\r\nis to conceal them;\r\n\r\n[The piquancy of the paradox evaporates in translation. Concealment is\r\nperhaps not so much actual invisibility (see _supra_ § 9) as \"showing\r\nno sign\" of what you mean to do, of the plans that are formed in your\r\nbrain.]\r\n\r\n\r\nconceal your dispositions, and you will be safe from the prying of the\r\nsubtlest spies, from the machinations of the wisest brains.\r\n\r\n[Tu Mu explains: \"Though the enemy may have clever and capable\r\nofficers, they will not be able to lay any plans against us.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n26. How victory may be produced for them out of the enemy’s own\r\ntactics—that is what the multitude cannot comprehend.\r\n\r\n27. All men can see the tactics whereby I conquer, but what none can\r\nsee is the strategy out of which victory is evolved.\r\n\r\n[_I.e._, everybody can see superficially how a battle is won; what they\r\ncannot see is the long series of plans and combinations which has\r\npreceded the battle.]\r\n\r\n\r\n28. Do not repeat the tactics which have gained you one victory, but\r\nlet your methods be regulated by the infinite variety of circumstances.\r\n\r\n[As Wang Hsi sagely remarks: \"There is but one root-principle\r\nunderlying victory, but the tactics which lead up to it are infinite in\r\nnumber.\" With this compare Col. Henderson: \"The rules of strategy are\r\nfew and simple. They may be learned in a week. They may be taught by\r\nfamiliar illustrations or a dozen diagrams. But such knowledge will no\r\nmore teach a man to lead an army like Napoleon than a knowledge of\r\ngrammar will teach him to write like Gibbon.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n29. Military tactics are like unto water; for water in its natural\r\ncourse runs away from high places and hastens downwards.\r\n\r\n30. So in war, the way is to avoid what is strong and to strike at what\r\nis weak.\r\n\r\n[Like water, taking the line of least resistance.]\r\n\r\n\r\n31. Water shapes its course according to the nature of the ground over\r\nwhich it flows; the soldier works out his victory in relation to the\r\nfoe whom he is facing.\r\n\r\n32. Therefore, just as water retains no constant shape, so in warfare\r\nthere are no constant conditions.\r\n\r\n33. He who can modify his tactics in relation to his opponent and\r\nthereby succeed in winning, may be called a heaven-born captain.\r\n\r\n34. The five elements (water, fire, wood, metal, earth) are not always\r\nequally predominant;\r\n\r\n[That is, as Wang Hsi says: \"they predominate alternately.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nthe four seasons make way for each other in turn.\r\n\r\n[Literally, \"have no invariable seat.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are short days and long; the moon has its periods of waning and\r\nwaxing.\r\n\r\n[Cf. V. § 6. The purport of the passage is simply to illustrate the\r\nwant of fixity in war by the changes constantly taking place in Nature.\r\nThe comparison is not very happy, however, because the regularity of\r\nthe phenomena which Sun Tzŭ mentions is by no means paralleled in war.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] See Col. Henderson’s biography of Stonewall Jackson, 1902 ed., vol.\r\nII, p. 490.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VII. MANŒUVERING\r\n\r\n1. Sun Tzŭ said: In war, the general receives his commands from the\r\nsovereign.\r\n\r\n2. Having collected an army and concentrated his forces, he must blend\r\nand harmonise the different elements thereof before pitching his camp.\r\n\r\n[\"Chang Yu says: \"the establishment of harmony and confidence between\r\nthe higher and lower ranks before venturing into the field;\" and he\r\nquotes a saying of Wu Tzŭ (chap. 1 ad init.): \"Without harmony in the\r\nState, no military expedition can be undertaken; without harmony in the\r\narmy, no battle array can be formed.\" In an historical romance Sun Tzŭ\r\nis represented as saying to Wu Yuan: \"As a general rule, those who are\r\nwaging war should get rid of all the domestic troubles before\r\nproceeding to attack the external foe.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n3. After that, comes tactical manœuvering, than which there is nothing\r\nmore difficult.\r\n\r\n[I have departed slightly from the traditional interpretation of Ts’ao\r\nKung, who says: \"From the time of receiving the sovereign’s\r\ninstructions until our encampment over against the enemy, the tactics\r\nto be pursued are most difficult.\" It seems to me that the tactics or\r\nmanœuvers can hardly be said to begin until the army has sallied forth\r\nand encamped, and Ch’ien Hao’s note gives color to this view: \"For\r\nlevying, concentrating, harmonizing and entrenching an army, there are\r\nplenty of old rules which will serve. The real difficulty comes when we\r\nengage in tactical operations.\" Tu Yu also observes that \"the great\r\ndifficulty is to be beforehand with the enemy in seizing favourable\r\nposition.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of tactical manœuvering consists in turning the devious\r\ninto the direct, and misfortune into gain.\r\n\r\n[This sentence contains one of those highly condensed and somewhat\r\nenigmatical expressions of which Sun Tzŭ is so fond. This is how it is\r\nexplained by Ts’ao Kung: \"Make it appear that you are a long way off,\r\nthen cover the distance rapidly and arrive on the scene before your\r\nopponent.\" Tu Mu says: \"Hoodwink the enemy, so that he may be remiss\r\nand leisurely while you are dashing along with utmost speed.\" Ho Shih\r\ngives a slightly different turn: \"Although you may have difficult\r\nground to traverse and natural obstacles to encounter this is a\r\ndrawback which can be turned into actual advantage by celerity of\r\nmovement.\" Signal examples of this saying are afforded by the two\r\nfamous passages across the Alps—that of Hannibal, which laid Italy at\r\nhis mercy, and that of Napoleon two thousand years later, which\r\nresulted in the great victory of Marengo.]\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Thus, to take a long and circuitous route, after enticing the enemy\r\nout of the way, and though starting after him, to contrive to reach the\r\ngoal before him, shows knowledge of the artifice of _deviation_.\r\n\r\n[Tu Mu cites the famous march of Chao She in 270 B.C. to relieve the\r\ntown of O-yu, which was closely invested by a Ch’in army. The King of\r\nChao first consulted Lien P’o on the advisability of attempting a\r\nrelief, but the latter thought the distance too great, and the\r\nintervening country too rugged and difficult. His Majesty then turned\r\nto Chao She, who fully admitted the hazardous nature of the march, but\r\nfinally said: \"We shall be like two rats fighting in a whole—and the\r\npluckier one will win!\" So he left the capital with his army, but had\r\nonly gone a distance of 30 _li_ when he stopped and began throwing up\r\nentrenchments. For 28 days he continued strengthening his\r\nfortifications, and took care that spies should carry the intelligence\r\nto the enemy. The Ch’in general was overjoyed, and attributed his\r\nadversary’s tardiness to the fact that the beleaguered city was in the\r\nHan State, and thus not actually part of Chao territory. But the spies\r\nhad no sooner departed than Chao She began a forced march lasting for\r\ntwo days and one night, and arrive on the scene of action with such\r\nastonishing rapidity that he was able to occupy a commanding position\r\non the \"North hill\" before the enemy had got wind of his movements. A\r\ncrushing defeat followed for the Ch’in forces, who were obliged to\r\nraise the siege of O-yu in all haste and retreat across the border.]\r\n\r\n\r\n5. Manœuvering with an army is advantageous; with an undisciplined\r\nmultitude, most dangerous.\r\n\r\n[I adopt the reading of the _T’ung Tien_, Cheng Yu-hsien and the _T’u\r\nShu_, since they appear to apply the exact nuance required in order to\r\nmake sense. The commentators using the standard text take this line to\r\nmean that manœuvers may be profitable, or they may be dangerous: it all\r\ndepends on the ability of the general.]\r\n\r\n\r\n6. If you set a fully equipped army in march in order to snatch an\r\nadvantage, the chances are that you will be too late. On the other\r\nhand, to detach a flying column for the purpose involves the sacrifice\r\nof its baggage and stores.\r\n\r\n[Some of the Chinese text is unintelligible to the Chinese\r\ncommentators, who paraphrase the sentence. I submit my own rendering\r\nwithout much enthusiasm, being convinced that there is some deep-seated\r\ncorruption in the text. On the whole, it is clear that Sun Tzŭ does not\r\napprove of a lengthy march being undertaken without supplies. Cf.\r\ninfra, § 11.]\r\n\r\n\r\n7. Thus, if you order your men to roll up their buff-coats, and make\r\nforced marches without halting day or night, covering double the usual\r\ndistance at a stretch,\r\n\r\n[The ordinary day’s march, according to Tu Mu, was 30 _li_; but on one\r\noccasion, when pursuing Liu Pei, Ts’ao Ts’ao is said to have covered\r\nthe incredible distance of 300 _li_ within twenty-four hours.]\r\n\r\n\r\ndoing a hundred _li_ in order to wrest an advantage, the leaders of all\r\nyour three divisions will fall into the hands of the enemy.\r\n\r\n8. The stronger men will be in front, the jaded ones will fall behind,\r\nand on this plan only one-tenth of your army will reach its\r\ndestination.\r\n\r\n[The moral is, as Ts’ao Kung and others point out: Don’t march a\r\nhundred _li_ to gain a tactical advantage, either with or without\r\nimpedimenta. Manœuvers of this description should be confined to short\r\ndistances. Stonewall Jackson said: \"The hardships of forced marches are\r\noften more painful than the dangers of battle.\" He did not often call\r\nupon his troops for extraordinary exertions. It was only when he\r\nintended a surprise, or when a rapid retreat was imperative, that he\r\nsacrificed everything for speed. [1] ]\r\n\r\n\r\n9. If you march fifty _li_ in order to outmanœuver the enemy, you will\r\nlose the leader of your first division, and only half your force will\r\nreach the goal.\r\n\r\n[Literally, \"the leader of the first division will be _torn away_.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n10. If you march thirty _li_ with the same object, two-thirds of your\r\narmy will arrive.\r\n\r\n[In the _T’ung Tien_ is added: \"From this we may know the difficulty of\r\nmanœuvering.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n11. We may take it then that an army without its baggage-train is lost;\r\nwithout provisions it is lost; without bases of supply it is lost.\r\n\r\n[I think Sun Tzŭ meant \"stores accumulated in dépôts.\" But Tu Yu says\r\n\"fodder and the like,\" Chang Yu says \"Goods in general,\" and Wang Hsi\r\nsays \"fuel, salt, foodstuffs, etc.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n12. We cannot enter into alliances until we are acquainted with the\r\ndesigns of our neighbours.\r\n\r\n13. We are not fit to lead an army on the march unless we are familiar\r\nwith the face of the country—its mountains and forests, its pitfalls\r\nand precipices, its marshes and swamps.\r\n\r\n14. We shall be unable to turn natural advantages to account unless we\r\nmake use of local guides.\r\n\r\n[§§. 12-14 are repeated in chap. XI. § 52.]\r\n\r\n\r\n15. In war, practise dissimulation, and you will succeed.\r\n\r\n[In the tactics of Turenne, deception of the enemy, especially as to\r\nthe numerical strength of his troops, took a very prominent position.\r\n[2] ]\r\n\r\nMove only if there is a real advantage to be gained.\r\n\r\n16. Whether to concentrate or to divide your troops, must be decided by\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\n17. Let your rapidity be that of the wind,\r\n\r\n[The simile is doubly appropriate, because the wind is not only swift\r\nbut, as Mei Yao-ch’en points out, \"invisible and leaves no tracks.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nyour compactness that of the forest.\r\n\r\n[Meng Shih comes nearer to the mark in his note: \"When slowly marching,\r\norder and ranks must be preserved\"—so as to guard against surprise\r\nattacks. But natural forest do not grow in rows, whereas they do\r\ngenerally possess the quality of density or compactness.]\r\n\r\n\r\n18. In raiding and plundering be like fire,\r\n\r\n[Cf. _Shih Ching_, IV. 3. iv. 6: \"Fierce as a blazing fire which no man\r\ncan check.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nin immovability like a mountain.\r\n\r\n[That is, when holding a position from which the enemy is trying to\r\ndislodge you, or perhaps, as Tu Yu says, when he is trying to entice\r\nyou into a trap.]\r\n\r\n\r\n19. Let your plans be dark and impenetrable as night, and when you\r\nmove, fall like a thunderbolt.\r\n\r\n[Tu Yu quotes a saying of T’ai Kung which has passed into a proverb:\r\n\"You cannot shut your ears to the thunder or your eyes to the\r\nlighting—so rapid are they.\" Likewise, an attack should be made so\r\nquickly that it cannot be parried.]\r\n\r\n\r\n20. When you plunder a countryside, let the spoil be divided amongst\r\nyour men;\r\n\r\n[Sun Tzŭ wishes to lessen the abuses of indiscriminate plundering by\r\ninsisting that all booty shall be thrown into a common stock, which may\r\nafterwards be fairly divided amongst all.]\r\n\r\n\r\nwhen you capture new territory, cut it up into allotments for the\r\nbenefit of the soldiery.\r\n\r\n[Ch’en Hao says \"quarter your soldiers on the land, and let them sow\r\nand plant it.\" It is by acting on this principle, and harvesting the\r\nlands they invaded, that the Chinese have succeeded in carrying out\r\nsome of their most memorable and triumphant expeditions, such as that\r\nof Pan Ch’ao who penetrated to the Caspian, and in more recent years,\r\nthose of Fu-k’ang-an and Tso Tsung-t’ang.]\r\n\r\n\r\n21. Ponder and deliberate before you make a move.\r\n\r\n[Chang Yu quotes Wei Liao Tzŭ as saying that we must not break camp\r\nuntil we have gained the resisting power of the enemy and the\r\ncleverness of the opposing general. Cf. the \"seven comparisons\" in I. §\r\n13.]\r\n\r\n\r\n22. He will conquer who has learnt the artifice of deviation.\r\n\r\n[See _supra_, §§ 3, 4.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch is the art of manœuvering.\r\n\r\n[With these words, the chapter would naturally come to an end. But\r\nthere now follows a long appendix in the shape of an extract from an\r\nearlier book on War, now lost, but apparently extant at the time when\r\nSun Tzŭ wrote. The style of this fragment is not noticeably different\r\nfrom that of Sun Tzŭ himself, but no commentator raises a doubt as to\r\nits genuineness.]\r\n\r\n\r\n23. The Book of Army Management says:\r\n\r\n[It is perhaps significant that none of the earlier commentators give\r\nus any information about this work. Mei Yao- Ch’en calls it \"an ancient\r\nmilitary classic,\" and Wang Hsi, \"an old book on war.\" Considering the\r\nenormous amount of fighting that had gone on for centuries before Sun\r\nTzŭ’s time between the various kingdoms and principalities of China, it\r\nis not in itself improbable that a collection of military maxims should\r\nhave been made and written down at some earlier period.]\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the field of battle,\r\n\r\n[Implied, though not actually in the Chinese.]\r\n\r\n\r\nthe spoken word does not carry far enough: hence the institution of\r\ngongs and drums. Nor can ordinary objects be seen clearly enough: hence\r\nthe institution of banners and flags.\r\n\r\n24. Gongs and drums, banners and flags, are means whereby the ears and\r\neyes of the host may be focussed on one particular point.\r\n\r\n[Chang Yu says: \"If sight and hearing converge simultaneously on the\r\nsame object, the evolutions of as many as a million soldiers will be\r\nlike those of a single man.\"!]\r\n\r\n\r\n25. The host thus forming a single united body, is it impossible either\r\nfor the brave to advance alone, or for the cowardly to retreat alone.\r\n\r\n[Chuang Yu quotes a saying: \"Equally guilty are those who advance\r\nagainst orders and those who retreat against orders.\" Tu Mu tells a\r\nstory in this connection of Wu Ch’i, when he was fighting against the\r\nCh’in State. Before the battle had begun, one of his soldiers, a man of\r\nmatchless daring, sallied forth by himself, captured two heads from the\r\nenemy, and returned to camp. Wu Ch’i had the man instantly executed,\r\nwhereupon an officer ventured to remonstrate, saying: \"This man was a\r\ngood soldier, and ought not to have been beheaded.\" Wu Ch’i replied: \"I\r\nfully believe he was a good soldier, but I had him beheaded because he\r\nacted without orders.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the art of handling large masses of men.\r\n\r\n26. In night-fighting, then, make much use of signal-fires and drums,\r\nand in fighting by day, of flags and banners, as a means of influencing\r\nthe ears and eyes of your army.\r\n\r\n[Ch’en Hao alludes to Li Kuang-pi’s night ride to Ho-yang at the head\r\nof 500 mounted men; they made such an imposing display with torches,\r\nthat though the rebel leader Shih Ssu-ming had a large army, he did not\r\ndare to dispute their passage.]\r\n\r\n\r\n27. A whole army may be robbed of its spirit;\r\n\r\n[\"In war,\" says Chang Yu, \"if a spirit of anger can be made to pervade\r\nall ranks of an army at one and the same time, its onset will be\r\nirresistible. Now the spirit of the enemy’s soldiers will be keenest\r\nwhen they have newly arrived on the scene, and it is therefore our cue\r\nnot to fight at once, but to wait until their ardor and enthusiasm have\r\nworn off, and then strike. It is in this way that they may be robbed of\r\ntheir keen spirit.\" Li Ch’uan and others tell an anecdote (to be found\r\nin the _Tso Chuan_, year 10, § 1) of Ts’ao Kuei, a protege of Duke\r\nChuang of Lu. The latter State was attacked by Ch’i, and the duke was\r\nabout to join battle at Ch’ang-cho, after the first roll of the enemy’s\r\ndrums, when Ts’ao said: \"Not just yet.\" Only after their drums had\r\nbeaten for the third time, did he give the word for attack. Then they\r\nfought, and the men of Ch’i were utterly defeated. Questioned\r\nafterwards by the Duke as to the meaning of his delay, Ts’ao Kuei\r\nreplied: \"In battle, a courageous spirit is everything. Now the first\r\nroll of the drum tends to create this spirit, but with the second it is\r\nalready on the wane, and after the third it is gone altogether. I\r\nattacked when their spirit was gone and ours was at its height. Hence\r\nour victory.\" Wu Tzŭ (chap. 4) puts \"spirit\" first among the \"four\r\nimportant influences\" in war, and continues: \"The value of a whole\r\narmy—a mighty host of a million men—is dependent on one man alone: such\r\nis the influence of spirit!\"]\r\n\r\n\r\na commander-in-chief may be robbed of his presence of mind.\r\n\r\n[Chang Yu says: \"Presence of mind is the general’s most important\r\nasset. It is the quality which enables him to discipline disorder and\r\nto inspire courage into the panic-stricken.\" The great general Li Ching\r\n(A.D. 571-649) has a saying: \"Attacking does not merely consist in\r\nassaulting walled cities or striking at an army in battle array; it\r\nmust include the art of assailing the enemy’s mental equilibrium.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n28. Now a soldier’s spirit is keenest in the morning;\r\n\r\n[Always provided, I suppose, that he has had breakfast. At the battle\r\nof the Trebia, the Romans were foolishly allowed to fight fasting,\r\nwhereas Hannibal’s men had breakfasted at their leisure. See Livy, XXI,\r\nliv. 8, lv. 1 and 8.]\r\n\r\n\r\nby noonday it has begun to flag; and in the evening, his mind is bent\r\nonly on returning to camp.\r\n\r\n29. A clever general, therefore, avoids an army when its spirit is\r\nkeen, but attacks it when it is sluggish and inclined to return. This\r\nis the art of studying moods.\r\n\r\n30. Disciplined and calm, to await the appearance of disorder and\r\nhubbub amongst the enemy:—this is the art of retaining self-possession.\r\n\r\n31. To be near the goal while the enemy is still far from it, to wait\r\nat ease while the enemy is toiling and struggling, to be well-fed while\r\nthe enemy is famished:—this is the art of husbanding one’s strength.\r\n\r\n32. To refrain from intercepting an enemy whose banners are in perfect\r\norder, to refrain from attacking an army drawn up in calm and confident\r\narray:—this is the art of studying circumstances.\r\n\r\n33. It is a military axiom not to advance uphill against the enemy, nor\r\nto oppose him when he comes downhill.\r\n\r\n34. Do not pursue an enemy who simulates flight; do not attack soldiers\r\nwhose temper is keen.\r\n\r\n35. Do not swallow a bait offered by the enemy.\r\n\r\n[Li Ch’uan and Tu Mu, with extraordinary inability to see a metaphor,\r\ntake these words quite literally of food and drink that have been\r\npoisoned by the enemy. Ch’en Hao and Chang Yu carefully point out that\r\nthe saying has a wider application.]\r\n\r\n\r\nDo not interfere with an army that is returning home.\r\n\r\n[The commentators explain this rather singular piece of advice by\r\nsaying that a man whose heart is set on returning home will fight to\r\nthe death against any attempt to bar his way, and is therefore too\r\ndangerous an opponent to be tackled. Chang Yu quotes the words of Han\r\nHsin: \"Invincible is the soldier who hath his desire and returneth\r\nhomewards.\" A marvelous tale is told of Ts’ao Ts’ao’s courage and\r\nresource in ch. 1 of the _San Kuo Chi_, In 198 A.D., he was besieging\r\nChang Hsiu in Jang, when Liu Piao sent reinforcements with a view to\r\ncutting off Ts’ao’s retreat. The latter was obliged to draw off his\r\ntroops, only to find himself hemmed in between two enemies, who were\r\nguarding each outlet of a narrow pass in which he had engaged himself.\r\nIn this desperate plight Ts’ao waited until nightfall, when he bored a\r\ntunnel into the mountain side and laid an ambush in it. As soon as the\r\nwhole army had passed by, the hidden troops fell on his rear, while\r\nTs’ao himself turned and met his pursuers in front, so that they were\r\nthrown into confusion and annihilated. Ts’ao Ts’ao said afterwards:\r\n\"The brigands tried to check my army in its retreat and brought me to\r\nbattle in a desperate position: hence I knew how to overcome them.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n36. When you surround an army, leave an outlet free.\r\n\r\n[This does not mean that the enemy is to be allowed to escape. The\r\nobject, as Tu Mu puts it, is \"to make him believe that there is a road\r\nto safety, and thus prevent his fighting with the courage of despair.\"\r\nTu Mu adds pleasantly: \"After that, you may crush him.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nDo not press a desperate foe too hard.\r\n\r\n[Ch’en Hao quotes the saying: \"Birds and beasts when brought to bay\r\nwill use their claws and teeth.\" Chang Yu says: \"If your adversary has\r\nburned his boats and destroyed his cooking-pots, and is ready to stake\r\nall on the issue of a battle, he must not be pushed to extremities.\" Ho\r\nShih illustrates the meaning by a story taken from the life of\r\nYen-ch’ing. That general, together with his colleague Tu Chung-wei was\r\nsurrounded by a vastly superior army of Khitans in the year 945 A.D.\r\nThe country was bare and desert-like, and the little Chinese force was\r\nsoon in dire straits for want of water. The wells they bored ran dry,\r\nand the men were reduced to squeezing lumps of mud and sucking out the\r\nmoisture. Their ranks thinned rapidly, until at last Fu Yen-ch’ing\r\nexclaimed: \"We are desperate men. Far better to die for our country\r\nthan to go with fettered hands into captivity!\" A strong gale happened\r\nto be blowing from the northeast and darkening the air with dense\r\nclouds of sandy dust. To Chung-wei was for waiting until this had\r\nabated before deciding on a final attack; but luckily another officer,\r\nLi Shou-cheng by name, was quicker to see an opportunity, and said:\r\n\"They are many and we are few, but in the midst of this sandstorm our\r\nnumbers will not be discernible; victory will go to the strenuous\r\nfighter, and the wind will be our best ally.\" Accordingly, Fu\r\nYen-ch’ing made a sudden and wholly unexpected onslaught with his\r\ncavalry, routed the barbarians and succeeded in breaking through to\r\nsafety.]\r\n\r\n\r\n37. Such is the art of warfare.\r\n\r\n[1] See Col. Henderson, op. cit. vol. I. p. 426.\r\n\r\n[2] For a number of maxims on this head, see \"Marshal Turenne\"\r\n(Longmans, 1907), p. 29.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VIII. VARIATION OF TACTICS\r\n\r\n[The heading means literally \"The Nine Variations,\" but as Sun Tzŭ does\r\nnot appear to enumerate these, and as, indeed, he has already told us\r\n(V §§ 6-11) that such deflections from the ordinary course are\r\npractically innumerable, we have little option but to follow Wang Hsi,\r\nwho says that \"Nine\" stands for an indefinitely large number. \"All it\r\nmeans is that in warfare we ought to vary our tactics to the utmost\r\ndegree…. I do not know what Ts’ao Kung makes these Nine Variations out\r\nto be, but it has been suggested that they are connected with the Nine\r\nSituations\" - of chapt. XI. This is the view adopted by Chang Yu. The\r\nonly other alternative is to suppose that something has been lost—a\r\nsupposition to which the unusual shortness of the chapter lends some\r\nweight.]\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Sun Tzŭ said: In war, the general receives his commands from the\r\nsovereign, collects his army and concentrates his forces.\r\n\r\n[Repeated from VII. § 1, where it is certainly more in place. It may\r\nhave been interpolated here merely in order to supply a beginning to\r\nthe chapter.]\r\n\r\n\r\n2. When in difficult country, do not encamp. In country where high\r\nroads intersect, join hands with your allies. Do not linger in\r\ndangerously isolated positions.\r\n\r\n[The last situation is not one of the Nine Situations as given in the\r\nbeginning of chap. XI, but occurs later on (ibid. § 43. q.v.). Chang Yu\r\ndefines this situation as being situated across the frontier, in\r\nhostile territory. Li Ch’uan says it is \"country in which there are no\r\nsprings or wells, flocks or herds, vegetables or firewood;\" Chia Lin,\r\n\"one of gorges, chasms and precipices, without a road by which to\r\nadvance.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn hemmed-in situations, you must resort to stratagem. In a desperate\r\nposition, you must fight.\r\n\r\n3. There are roads which must not be followed,\r\n\r\n[\"Especially those leading through narrow defiles,\" says Li Ch’uan,\r\n\"where an ambush is to be feared.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\narmies which must be not attacked,\r\n\r\n[More correctly, perhaps, \"there are times when an army must not be\r\nattacked.\" Ch’en Hao says: \"When you see your way to obtain a rival\r\nadvantage, but are powerless to inflict a real defeat, refrain from\r\nattacking, for fear of overtaxing your men’s strength.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\ntowns which must not be besieged,\r\n\r\n[Cf. III. § 4 Ts’ao Kung gives an interesting illustration from his own\r\nexperience. When invading the territory of Hsu-chou, he ignored the\r\ncity of Hua-pi, which lay directly in his path, and pressed on into the\r\nheart of the country. This excellent strategy was rewarded by the\r\nsubsequent capture of no fewer than fourteen important district cities.\r\nChang Yu says: \"No town should be attacked which, if taken, cannot be\r\nheld, or if left alone, will not cause any trouble.\" Hsun Ying, when\r\nurged to attack Pi-yang, replied: \"The city is small and\r\nwell-fortified; even if I succeed intaking it, it will be no great feat\r\nof arms; whereas if I fail, I shall make myself a laughing-stock.\" In\r\nthe seventeenth century, sieges still formed a large proportion of war.\r\nIt was Turenne who directed attention to the importance of marches,\r\ncountermarches and manœuvers. He said: \"It is a great mistake to waste\r\nmen in taking a town when the same expenditure of soldiers will gain a\r\nprovince.\" [1] ]\r\n\r\n\r\npositions which must not be contested, commands of the sovereign which\r\nmust not be obeyed.\r\n\r\n[This is a hard saying for the Chinese, with their reverence for\r\nauthority, and Wei Liao Tzŭ (quoted by Tu Mu) is moved to exclaim:\r\n\"Weapons are baleful instruments, strife is antagonistic to virtue, a\r\nmilitary commander is the negation of civil order!\" The unpalatable\r\nfact remains, however, that even Imperial wishes must be subordinated\r\nto military necessity.]\r\n\r\n\r\n4. The general who thoroughly understands the advantages that accompany\r\nvariation of tactics knows how to handle his troops.\r\n\r\n5. The general who does not understand these, may be well acquainted\r\nwith the configuration of the country, yet he will not be able to turn\r\nhis knowledge to practical account.\r\n\r\n[Literally, \"get the advantage of the ground,\" which means not only\r\nsecuring good positions, but availing oneself of natural advantages in\r\nevery possible way. Chang Yu says: \"Every kind of ground is\r\ncharacterized by certain natural features, and also gives scope for a\r\ncertain variability of plan. How it is possible to turn these natural\r\nfeatures to account unless topographical knowledge is supplemented by\r\nversatility of mind?\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n6. So, the student of war who is unversed in the art of war of varying\r\nhis plans, even though he be acquainted with the Five Advantages, will\r\nfail to make the best use of his men.\r\n\r\n[Chia Lin tells us that these imply five obvious and generally\r\nadvantageous lines of action, namely: \"if a certain road is short, it\r\nmust be followed; if an army is isolated, it must be attacked; if a\r\ntown is in a parlous condition, it must be besieged; if a position can\r\nbe stormed, it must be attempted; and if consistent with military\r\noperations, the ruler’s commands must be obeyed.\" But there are\r\ncircumstances which sometimes forbid a general to use these advantages.\r\nFor instance, \"a certain road may be the shortest way for him, but if\r\nhe knows that it abounds in natural obstacles, or that the enemy has\r\nlaid an ambush on it, he will not follow that road. A hostile force may\r\nbe open to attack, but if he knows that it is hard-pressed and likely\r\nto fight with desperation, he will refrain from striking,\" and so on.]\r\n\r\n\r\n7. Hence in the wise leader’s plans, considerations of advantage and of\r\ndisadvantage will be blended together.\r\n\r\n[\"Whether in an advantageous position or a disadvantageous one,\" says\r\nTs’ao Kung, \"the opposite state should be always present to your\r\nmind.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n8. If our expectation of advantage be tempered in this way, we may\r\nsucceed in accomplishing the essential part of our schemes.\r\n\r\n[Tu Mu says: \"If we wish to wrest an advantage from the enemy, we must\r\nnot fix our minds on that alone, but allow for the possibility of the\r\nenemy also doing some harm to us, and let this enter as a factor into\r\nour calculations.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n9. If, on the other hand, in the midst of difficulties we are always\r\nready to seize an advantage, we may extricate ourselves from\r\nmisfortune.\r\n\r\n[Tu Mu says: \"If I wish to extricate myself from a dangerous position,\r\nI must consider not only the enemy’s ability to injure me, but also my\r\nown ability to gain an advantage over the enemy. If in my counsels\r\nthese two considerations are properly blended, I shall succeed in\r\nliberating myself…. For instance; if I am surrounded by the enemy and\r\nonly think of effecting an escape, the nervelessness of my policy will\r\nincite my adversary to pursue and crush me; it would be far better to\r\nencourage my men to deliver a bold counter-attack, and use the\r\nadvantage thus gained to free myself from the enemy’s toils.\" See the\r\nstory of Ts’ao Ts’ao, VII. § 35, note.]\r\n\r\n\r\n10. Reduce the hostile chiefs by inflicting damage on them;\r\n\r\n[Chia Lin enumerates several ways of inflicting this injury, some of\r\nwhich would only occur to the Oriental mind:—\"Entice away the enemy’s\r\nbest and wisest men, so that he may be left without counselors.\r\nIntroduce traitors into his country, that the government policy may be\r\nrendered futile. Foment intrigue and deceit, and thus sow dissension\r\nbetween the ruler and his ministers. By means of every artful\r\ncontrivance, cause deterioration amongst his men and waste of his\r\ntreasure. Corrupt his morals by insidious gifts leading him into\r\nexcess. Disturb and unsettle his mind by presenting him with lovely\r\nwomen.\" Chang Yu (after Wang Hsi) makes a different interpretation of\r\nSun Tzŭ here: \"Get the enemy into a position where he must suffer\r\ninjury, and he will submit of his own accord.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nand make trouble for them,\r\n\r\n[Tu Mu, in this phrase, in his interpretation indicates that trouble\r\nshould be made for the enemy affecting their \"possessions,\" or, as we\r\nmight say, \"assets,\" which he considers to be \"a large army, a rich\r\nexchequer, harmony amongst the soldiers, punctual fulfillment of\r\ncommands.\" These give us a whip-hand over the enemy.]\r\n\r\n\r\nand keep them constantly engaged;\r\n\r\n[Literally, \"make servants of them.\" Tu Yu says \"prevent them from\r\nhaving any rest.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nhold out specious allurements, and make them rush to any given point.\r\n\r\n[Meng Shih’s note contains an excellent example of the idiomatic use\r\nof: \"cause them to forget _pien_ (the reasons for acting otherwise than\r\non their first impulse), and hasten in our direction.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n11. The art of war teaches us to rely not on the likelihood of the\r\nenemy’s not coming, but on our own readiness to receive him; not on the\r\nchance of his not attacking, but rather on the fact that we have made\r\nour position unassailable.\r\n\r\n12. There are five dangerous faults which may affect a general: (1)\r\nRecklessness, which leads to destruction;\r\n\r\n[\"Bravery without forethought,\" as Ts’ao Kung analyzes it, which causes\r\na man to fight blindly and desperately like a mad bull. Such an\r\nopponent, says Chang Yu, \"must not be encountered with brute force, but\r\nmay be lured into an ambush and slain.\" Cf. Wu Tzŭ, chap. IV. ad init.:\r\n\"In estimating the character of a general, men are wont to pay\r\nexclusive attention to his courage, forgetting that courage is only one\r\nout of many qualities which a general should possess. The merely brave\r\nman is prone to fight recklessly; and he who fights recklessly, without\r\nany perception of what is expedient, must be condemned.\" Ssu-ma Fa,\r\ntoo, makes the incisive remark: \"Simply going to one’s death does not\r\nbring about victory.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n(2) cowardice, which leads to capture;\r\n\r\n[Ts’ao Kung defines the Chinese word translated here as \"cowardice\" as\r\nbeing of the man \"whom timidity prevents from advancing to seize an\r\nadvantage,\" and Wang Hsi adds \"who is quick to flee at the sight of\r\ndanger.\" Meng Shih gives the closer paraphrase \"he who is bent on\r\nreturning alive,\" this is, the man who will never take a risk. But, as\r\nSun Tzŭ knew, nothing is to be achieved in war unless you are willing\r\nto take risks. T’ai Kung said: \"He who lets an advantage slip will\r\nsubsequently bring upon himself real disaster.\" In 404 A.D., Liu Yu\r\npursued the rebel Huan Hsuan up the Yangtsze and fought a naval battle\r\nwith him at the island of Ch’eng-hung. The loyal troops numbered only a\r\nfew thousands, while their opponents were in great force. But Huan\r\nHsuan, fearing the fate which was in store for him should be be\r\novercome, had a light boat made fast to the side of his war-junk, so\r\nthat he might escape, if necessary, at a moment’s notice. The natural\r\nresult was that the fighting spirit of his soldiers was utterly\r\nquenched, and when the loyalists made an attack from windward with\r\nfireships, all striving with the utmost ardor to be first in the fray,\r\nHuan Hsuan’s forces were routed, had to burn all their baggage and fled\r\nfor two days and nights without stopping. Chang Yu tells a somewhat\r\nsimilar story of Chao Ying-ch’i, a general of the Chin State who during\r\na battle with the army of Ch’u in 597 B.C. had a boat kept in readiness\r\nfor him on the river, wishing in case of defeat to be the first to get\r\nacross.]\r\n\r\n\r\n(3) a hasty temper, which can be provoked by insults;\r\n\r\n[Tu Mu tells us that Yao Hsing, when opposed in 357 A.D. by Huang Mei,\r\nTeng Ch’iang and others shut himself up behind his walls and refused to\r\nfight. Teng Ch’iang said: \"Our adversary is of a choleric temper and\r\neasily provoked; let us make constant sallies and break down his walls,\r\nthen he will grow angry and come out. Once we can bring his force to\r\nbattle, it is doomed to be our prey.\" This plan was acted upon, Yao\r\nHsiang came out to fight, was lured as far as San-yuan by the enemy’s\r\npretended flight, and finally attacked and slain.]\r\n\r\n\r\n(4) a delicacy of honour which is sensitive to shame;\r\n\r\nThis need not be taken to mean that a sense of honour is really a defect\r\nin a general. What Sun Tzŭ condemns is rather an exaggerated\r\nsensitiveness to slanderous reports, the thin-skinned man who is stung\r\nby opprobrium, however undeserved. Mei Yao-ch’en truly observes, though\r\nsomewhat paradoxically: \"The seeker after glory should be careless of\r\npublic opinion.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n(5) over-solicitude for his men, which exposes him to worry and\r\ntrouble.\r\n\r\n[Here again, Sun Tzŭ does not mean that the general is to be careless\r\nof the welfare of his troops. All he wishes to emphasize is the danger\r\nof sacrificing any important military advantage to the immediate\r\ncomfort of his men. This is a shortsighted policy, because in the long\r\nrun the troops will suffer more from the defeat, or, at best, the\r\nprolongation of the war, which will be the consequence. A mistaken\r\nfeeling of pity will often induce a general to relieve a beleaguered\r\ncity, or to reinforce a hard-pressed detachment, contrary to his\r\nmilitary instincts. It is now generally admitted that our repeated\r\nefforts to relieve Ladysmith in the South African War were so many\r\nstrategical blunders which defeated their own purpose. And in the end,\r\nrelief came through the very man who started out with the distinct\r\nresolve no longer to subordinate the interests of the whole to\r\nsentiment in favour of a part. An old soldier of one of our generals who\r\nfailed most conspicuously in this war, tried once, I remember, to\r\ndefend him to me on the ground that he was always \"so good to his men.\"\r\nBy this plea, had he but known it, he was only condemning him out of\r\nSun Tzŭ’s mouth.]\r\n\r\n\r\n13. These are the five besetting sins of a general, ruinous to the\r\nconduct of war.\r\n\r\n14. When an army is overthrown and its leader slain, the cause will\r\nsurely be found among these five dangerous faults. Let them be a\r\nsubject of meditation.\r\n\r\n[1] \"Marshal Turenne,\" p. 50.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IX. THE ARMY ON THE MARCH\r\n\r\n[The contents of this interesting chapter are better indicated in § 1\r\nthan by this heading.]\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Sun Tzŭ said: We come now to the question of encamping the army, and\r\nobserving signs of the enemy. Pass quickly over mountains, and keep in\r\nthe neighbourhood of valleys.\r\n\r\n[The idea is, not to linger among barren uplands, but to keep close to\r\nsupplies of water and grass. Cf. Wu Tzŭ, ch. 3: \"Abide not in natural\r\novens,\" i.e. \"the openings of valleys.\" Chang Yu tells the following\r\nanecdote: Wu-tu Ch’iang was a robber captain in the time of the Later\r\nHan, and Ma Yuan was sent to exterminate his gang. Ch’iang having found\r\na refuge in the hills, Ma Yuan made no attempt to force a battle, but\r\nseized all the favourable positions commanding supplies of water and\r\nforage. Ch’iang was soon in such a desperate plight for want of\r\nprovisions that he was forced to make a total surrender. He did not\r\nknow the advantage of keeping in the neighbourhood of valleys.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Camp in high places,\r\n\r\n[Not on high hills, but on knolls or hillocks elevated above the\r\nsurrounding country.]\r\n\r\n\r\nfacing the sun.\r\n\r\n[Tu Mu takes this to mean \"facing south,\" and Ch’en Hao \"facing east.\"\r\nCf. infra, §§ 11, 13.\r\n\r\n\r\nDo not climb heights in order to fight. So much for mountain warfare.\r\n\r\n3. After crossing a river, you should get far away from it.\r\n\r\n[\"In order to tempt the enemy to cross after you,\" according to Ts’ao\r\nKung, and also, says Chang Yu, \"in order not to be impeded in your\r\nevolutions.\" The _T’ung Tien_ reads, \"If _the enemy_ crosses a river,\"\r\netc. But in view of the next sentence, this is almost certainly an\r\ninterpolation.]\r\n\r\n\r\n4. When an invading force crosses a river in its onward march, do not\r\nadvance to meet it in mid-stream. It will be best to let half the army\r\nget across, and then deliver your attack.\r\n\r\n[Li Ch’uan alludes to the great victory won by Han Hsin over Lung Chu\r\nat the Wei River. Turning to the _Ch’ien Han Shu_, ch. 34, fol. 6\r\nverso, we find the battle described as follows: \"The two armies were\r\ndrawn up on opposite sides of the river. In the night, Han Hsin ordered\r\nhis men to take some ten thousand sacks filled with sand and construct\r\na dam higher up. Then, leading half his army across, he attacked Lung\r\nChu; but after a time, pretending to have failed in his attempt, he\r\nhastily withdrew to the other bank. Lung Chu was much elated by this\r\nunlooked-for success, and exclaiming: \"I felt sure that Han Hsin was\r\nreally a coward!\" he pursued him and began crossing the river in his\r\nturn. Han Hsin now sent a party to cut open the sandbags, thus\r\nreleasing a great volume of water, which swept down and prevented the\r\ngreater portion of Lung Chu’s army from getting across. He then turned\r\nupon the force which had been cut off, and annihilated it, Lung Chu\r\nhimself being amongst the slain. The rest of the army, on the further\r\nbank, also scattered and fled in all directions.]\r\n\r\n\r\n5. If you are anxious to fight, you should not go to meet the invader\r\nnear a river which he has to cross.\r\n\r\n[For fear of preventing his crossing.]\r\n\r\n\r\n6. Moor your craft higher up than the enemy, and facing the sun.\r\n\r\n[See _supra_, § 2. The repetition of these words in connection with\r\nwater is very awkward. Chang Yu has the note: \"Said either of troops\r\nmarshalled on the river-bank, or of boats anchored in the stream itself;\r\nin either case it is essential to be higher than the enemy and facing\r\nthe sun.\" The other commentators are not at all explicit.]\r\n\r\n\r\nDo not move up-stream to meet the enemy.\r\n\r\n[Tu Mu says: \"As water flows downwards, we must not pitch our camp on\r\nthe lower reaches of a river, for fear the enemy should open the\r\nsluices and sweep us away in a flood. Chu-ko Wu-hou has remarked that\r\n‘in river warfare we must not advance against the stream,’ which is as\r\nmuch as to say that our fleet must not be anchored below that of the\r\nenemy, for then they would be able to take advantage of the current and\r\nmake short work of us.\" There is also the danger, noted by other\r\ncommentators, that the enemy may throw poison on the water to be\r\ncarried down to us.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSo much for river warfare.\r\n\r\n7. In crossing salt-marshes, your sole concern should be to get over\r\nthem quickly, without any delay.\r\n\r\n[Because of the lack of fresh water, the poor quality of the herbage,\r\nand last but not least, because they are low, flat, and exposed to\r\nattack.]\r\n\r\n\r\n8. If forced to fight in a salt-marsh, you should have water and grass\r\nnear you, and get your back to a clump of trees.\r\n\r\n[Li Ch’uan remarks that the ground is less likely to be treacherous\r\nwhere there are trees, while Tu Mu says that they will serve to protect\r\nthe rear.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSo much for operations in salt-marshes.\r\n\r\n9. In dry, level country, take up an easily accessible position with\r\nrising ground to your right and on your rear,\r\n\r\n[Tu Mu quotes T’ai Kung as saying: \"An army should have a stream or a\r\nmarsh on its left, and a hill or tumulus on its right.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nso that the danger may be in front, and safety lie behind. So much for\r\ncampaigning in flat country.\r\n\r\n10. These are the four useful branches of military knowledge\r\n\r\n[Those, namely, concerned with (1) mountains, (2) rivers, (3) marshes,\r\nand (4) plains. Compare Napoleon’s \"Military Maxims,\" no. 1.]\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich enabled the Yellow Emperor to vanquish four several sovereigns.\r\n\r\n[Regarding the \"Yellow Emperor\": Mei Yao-ch’en asks, with some\r\nplausibility, whether there is an error in the text as nothing is known\r\nof Huang Ti having conquered four other Emperors. The _Shih Chi_ (ch. 1\r\nad init.) speaks only of his victories over Yen Ti and Ch’ih Yu. In the\r\n_Liu T’ao_ it is mentioned that he \"fought seventy battles and pacified\r\nthe Empire.\" Ts’ao Kung’s explanation is, that the Yellow Emperor was\r\nthe first to institute the feudal system of vassals princes, each of\r\nwhom (to the number of four) originally bore the title of Emperor. Li\r\nCh’uan tells us that the art of war originated under Huang Ti, who\r\nreceived it from his Minister Feng Hou.]\r\n\r\n\r\n11. All armies prefer high ground to low,\r\n\r\n[\"High Ground,\" says Mei Yao-ch’en, \"is not only more agreeable and\r\nsalubrious, but more convenient from a military point of view; low\r\nground is not only damp and unhealthy, but also disadvantageous for\r\nfighting.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nand sunny places to dark.\r\n\r\n12. If you are careful of your men,\r\n\r\n[Ts’ao Kung says: \"Make for fresh water and pasture, where you can turn\r\nout your animals to graze.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nand camp on hard ground, the army will be free from disease of every\r\nkind,\r\n\r\n[Chang Yu says: \"The dryness of the climate will prevent the outbreak\r\nof illness.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nand this will spell victory.\r\n\r\n13. When you come to a hill or a bank, occupy the sunny side, with the\r\nslope on your right rear. Thus you will at once act for the benefit of\r\nyour soldiers and utilise the natural advantages of the ground.\r\n\r\n14. When, in consequence of heavy rains up-country, a river which you\r\nwish to ford is swollen and flecked with foam, you must wait until it\r\nsubsides.\r\n\r\n15. Country in which there are precipitous cliffs with torrents running\r\nbetween, deep natural hollows,\r\n\r\nThe latter defined as \"places enclosed on every side by steep banks,\r\nwith pools of water at the bottom.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nconfined places,\r\n\r\n[Defined as \"natural pens or prisons\" or \"places surrounded by\r\nprecipices on three sides—easy to get into, but hard to get out of.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\ntangled thickets,\r\n\r\n[Defined as \"places covered with such dense undergrowth that spears\r\ncannot be used.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nquagmires\r\n\r\n[Defined as \"low-lying places, so heavy with mud as to be impassable\r\nfor chariots and horsemen.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nand crevasses,\r\n\r\n[Defined by Mei Yao-ch’en as \"a narrow difficult way between beetling\r\ncliffs.\" Tu Mu’s note is \"ground covered with trees and rocks, and\r\nintersected by numerous ravines and pitfalls.\" This is very vague, but\r\nChia Lin explains it clearly enough as a defile or narrow pass, and\r\nChang Yu takes much the same view. On the whole, the weight of the\r\ncommentators certainly inclines to the rendering \"defile.\" But the\r\nordinary meaning of the Chinese in one place is \"a crack or fissure\"\r\nand the fact that the meaning of the Chinese elsewhere in the sentence\r\nindicates something in the nature of a defile, make me think that Sun\r\nTzŭ is here speaking of crevasses.]\r\n\r\n\r\nshould be left with all possible speed and not approached.\r\n\r\n16. While we keep away from such places, we should get the enemy to\r\napproach them; while we face them, we should let the enemy have them on\r\nhis rear.\r\n\r\n17. If in the neighbourhood of your camp there should be any hilly\r\ncountry, ponds surrounded by aquatic grass, hollow basins filled with\r\nreeds, or woods with thick undergrowth, they must be carefully routed\r\nout and searched; for these are places where men in ambush or insidious\r\nspies are likely to be lurking.\r\n\r\n[Chang Yu has the note: \"We must also be on our guard against traitors\r\nwho may lie in close covert, secretly spying out our weaknesses and\r\noverhearing our instructions.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n18. When the enemy is close at hand and remains quiet, he is relying on\r\nthe natural strength of his position.\r\n\r\n[Here begin Sun Tzŭ’s remarks on the reading of signs, much of which is\r\nso good that it could almost be included in a modern manual like Gen.\r\nBaden-Powell’s \"Aids to Scouting.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n19. When he keeps aloof and tries to provoke a battle, he is anxious\r\nfor the other side to advance.\r\n\r\n[Probably because we are in a strong position from which he wishes to\r\ndislodge us. \"If he came close up to us, says Tu Mu, \"and tried to\r\nforce a battle, he would seem to despise us, and there would be less\r\nprobability of our responding to the challenge.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n20. If his place of encampment is easy of access, he is tendering a\r\nbait.\r\n\r\n21. Movement amongst the trees of a forest shows that the enemy is\r\nadvancing.\r\n\r\n[Ts’ao Kung explains this as \"felling trees to clear a passage,\" and\r\nChang Yu says: \"Every man sends out scouts to climb high places and\r\nobserve the enemy. If a scout sees that the trees of a forest are\r\nmoving and shaking, he may know that they are being cut down to clear a\r\npassage for the enemy’s march.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe appearance of a number of screens in the midst of thick grass means\r\nthat the enemy wants to make us suspicious.\r\n\r\n[Tu Yu’s explanation, borrowed from Ts’ao Kung’s, is as follows: \"The\r\npresence of a number of screens or sheds in the midst of thick\r\nvegetation is a sure sign that the enemy has fled and, fearing pursuit,\r\nhas constructed these hiding-places in order to make us suspect an\r\nambush.\" It appears that these \"screens\" were hastily knotted together\r\nout of any long grass which the retreating enemy happened to come\r\nacross.]\r\n\r\n\r\n22. The rising of birds in their flight is the sign of an ambuscade.\r\n\r\n[Chang Yu’s explanation is doubtless right: \"When birds that are flying\r\nalong in a straight line suddenly shoot upwards, it means that soldiers\r\nare in ambush at the spot beneath.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nStartled beasts indicate that a sudden attack is coming.\r\n\r\n23. When there is dust rising in a high column, it is the sign of\r\nchariots advancing; when the dust is low, but spread over a wide area,\r\nit betokens the approach of infantry.\r\n\r\n[\"High and sharp,\" or rising to a peak, is of course somewhat\r\nexaggerated as applied to dust. The commentators explain the phenomenon\r\nby saying that horses and chariots, being heavier than men, raise more\r\ndust, and also follow one another in the same wheel-track, whereas\r\nfoot-soldiers would be marching in ranks, many abreast. According to\r\nChang Yu, \"every army on the march must have scouts some way in\r\nadvance, who on sighting dust raised by the enemy, will gallop back and\r\nreport it to the commander-in-chief.\" Cf. Gen. Baden-Powell: \"As you\r\nmove along, say, in a hostile country, your eyes should be looking afar\r\nfor the enemy or any signs of him: figures, dust rising, birds getting\r\nup, glitter of arms, etc.\" [1] ]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen it branches out in different directions, it shows that parties\r\nhave been sent to collect firewood. A few clouds of dust moving to and\r\nfro signify that the army is encamping.\r\n\r\n[Chang Yu says: \"In apportioning the defences for a cantonment, light\r\nhorse will be sent out to survey the position and ascertain the weak\r\nand strong points all along its circumference. Hence the small quantity\r\nof dust and its motion.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n24. Humble words and increased preparations are signs that the enemy is\r\nabout to advance.\r\n\r\n[\"As though they stood in great fear of us,\" says Tu Mu. \"Their object\r\nis to make us contemptuous and careless, after which they will attack\r\nus.\" Chang Yu alludes to the story of T’ien Tan of the Ch’i-mo against\r\nthe Yen forces, led by Ch’i Chieh. In ch. 82 of the _Shih Chi_ we read:\r\n\"T’ien Tan openly said: ‘My only fear is that the Yen army may cut off\r\nthe noses of their Ch’i prisoners and place them in the front rank to\r\nfight against us; that would be the undoing of our city.’ The other\r\nside being informed of this speech, at once acted on the suggestion;\r\nbut those within the city were enraged at seeing their\r\nfellow-countrymen thus mutilated, and fearing only lest they should\r\nfall into the enemy’s hands, were nerved to defend themselves more\r\nobstinately than ever. Once again T’ien Tan sent back converted spies\r\nwho reported these words to the enemy: \"What I dread most is that the\r\nmen of Yen may dig up the ancestral tombs outside the town, and by\r\ninflicting this indignity on our forefathers cause us to become\r\nfaint-hearted.’ Forthwith the besiegers dug up all the graves and\r\nburned the corpses lying in them. And the inhabitants of Chi-mo,\r\nwitnessing the outrage from the city-walls, wept passionately and were\r\nall impatient to go out and fight, their fury being increased tenfold.\r\nT’ien Tan knew then that his soldiers were ready for any enterprise.\r\nBut instead of a sword, he himself took a mattock in his hands, and\r\nordered others to be distributed amongst his best warriors, while the\r\nranks were filled up with their wives and concubines. He then served\r\nout all the remaining rations and bade his men eat their fill. The\r\nregular soldiers were told to keep out of sight, and the walls were\r\nmanned with the old and weaker men and with women. This done, envoys\r\nwere dispatched to the enemy’s camp to arrange terms of surrender,\r\nwhereupon the Yen army began shouting for joy. T’ien Tan also collected\r\n20,000 ounces of silver from the people, and got the wealthy citizens\r\nof Chi-mo to send it to the Yen general with the prayer that, when the\r\ntown capitulated, he would not allow their homes to be plundered or\r\ntheir women to be maltreated. Ch’i Chieh, in high good humor, granted\r\ntheir prayer; but his army now became increasingly slack and careless.\r\nMeanwhile, T’ien Tan got together a thousand oxen, decked them with\r\npieces of red silk, painted their bodies, dragon-like, with colored\r\nstripes, and fastened sharp blades on their horns and well-greased\r\nrushes on their tails. When night came on, he lighted the ends of the\r\nrushes, and drove the oxen through a number of holes which he had\r\npierced in the walls, backing them up with a force of 5000 picked\r\nwarriors. The animals, maddened with pain, dashed furiously into the\r\nenemy’s camp where they caused the utmost confusion and dismay; for\r\ntheir tails acted as torches, showing up the hideous pattern on their\r\nbodies, and the weapons on their horns killed or wounded any with whom\r\nthey came into contact. In the meantime, the band of 5000 had crept up\r\nwith gags in their mouths, and now threw themselves on the enemy. At\r\nthe same moment a frightful din arose in the city itself, all those\r\nthat remained behind making as much noise as possible by banging drums\r\nand hammering on bronze vessels, until heaven and earth were convulsed\r\nby the uproar. Terror-stricken, the Yen army fled in disorder, hotly\r\npursued by the men of Ch’i, who succeeded in slaying their general Ch’i\r\nChien…. The result of the battle was the ultimate recovery of some\r\nseventy cities which had belonged to the Ch’i State.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nViolent language and driving forward as if to the attack are signs that\r\nhe will retreat.\r\n\r\n25. When the light chariots come out first and take up a position on\r\nthe wings, it is a sign that the enemy is forming for battle.\r\n\r\n26. Peace proposals unaccompanied by a sworn covenant indicate a plot.\r\n\r\n[The reading here is uncertain. Li Ch’uan indicates \"a treaty confirmed\r\nby oaths and hostages.\" Wang Hsi and Chang Yu, on the other hand,\r\nsimply say \"without reason,\" \"on a frivolous pretext.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n27. When there is much running about\r\n\r\n[Every man hastening to his proper place under his own regimental\r\nbanner.]\r\n\r\n\r\nand the soldiers fall into rank, it means that the critical moment has\r\ncome.\r\n\r\n28. When some are seen advancing and some retreating, it is a lure.\r\n\r\n29. When the soldiers stand leaning on their spears, they are faint\r\nfrom want of food.\r\n\r\n30. If those who are sent to draw water begin by drinking themselves,\r\nthe army is suffering from thirst.\r\n\r\n[As Tu Mu remarks: \"One may know the condition of a whole army from the\r\nbehavior of a single man.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n31. If the enemy sees an advantage to be gained and makes no effort to\r\nsecure it, the soldiers are exhausted.\r\n\r\n32. If birds gather on any spot, it is unoccupied.\r\n\r\n[A useful fact to bear in mind when, for instance, as Ch’en Hao says,\r\nthe enemy has secretly abandoned his camp.]\r\n\r\n\r\nClamour by night betokens nervousness.\r\n\r\n33. If there is disturbance in the camp, the general’s authority is\r\nweak. If the banners and flags are shifted about, sedition is afoot. If\r\nthe officers are angry, it means that the men are weary.\r\n\r\n[Tu Mu understands the sentence differently: \"If all the officers of an\r\narmy are angry with their general, it means that they are broken with\r\nfatigue\" owing to the exertions which he has demanded from them.]\r\n\r\n\r\n34. When an army feeds its horses with grain and kills its cattle for\r\nfood,\r\n\r\n[In the ordinary course of things, the men would be fed on grain and\r\nthe horses chiefly on grass.]\r\n\r\n\r\nand when the men do not hang their cooking-pots over the camp-fires,\r\nshowing that they will not return to their tents, you may know that\r\nthey are determined to fight to the death.\r\n\r\n[I may quote here the illustrative passage from the _Hou Han Shu_, ch.\r\n71, given in abbreviated form by the _P’ei Wen Yun Fu:_ \"The rebel Wang\r\nKuo of Liang was besieging the town of Ch’en- ts’ang, and Huang-fu\r\nSung, who was in supreme command, and Tung Cho were sent out against\r\nhim. The latter pressed for hasty measures, but Sung turned a deaf ear\r\nto his counsel. At last the rebels were utterly worn out, and began to\r\nthrow down their weapons of their own accord. Sung was not advancing to\r\nthe attack, but Cho said: ‘It is a principle of war not to pursue\r\ndesperate men and not to press a retreating host.’ Sung answered: ‘That\r\ndoes not apply here. What I am about to attack is a jaded army, not a\r\nretreating host; with disciplined troops I am falling on a disorganized\r\nmultitude, not a band of desperate men.’ Thereupon he advances to the\r\nattack unsupported by his colleague, and routed the enemy, Wang Kuo\r\nbeing slain.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n35. The sight of men whispering together in small knots or speaking in\r\nsubdued tones points to disaffection amongst the rank and file.\r\n\r\n36. Too frequent rewards signify that the enemy is at the end of his\r\nresources;\r\n\r\n[Because, when an army is hard pressed, as Tu Mu says, there is always\r\na fear of mutiny, and lavish rewards are given to keep the men in good\r\ntemper.]\r\n\r\n\r\ntoo many punishments betray a condition of dire distress.\r\n\r\n[Because in such case discipline becomes relaxed, and unwonted severity\r\nis necessary to keep the men to their duty.]\r\n\r\n\r\n37. To begin by bluster, but afterwards to take fright at the enemy’s\r\nnumbers, shows a supreme lack of intelligence.\r\n\r\n[I follow the interpretation of Ts’ao Kung, also adopted by Li Ch’uan,\r\nTu Mu, and Chang Yu. Another possible meaning set forth by Tu Yu, Chia\r\nLin, Mei Tao-ch’en and Wang Hsi, is: \"The general who is first\r\ntyrannical towards his men, and then in terror lest they should mutiny,\r\netc.\" This would connect the sentence with what went before about\r\nrewards and punishments.]\r\n\r\n\r\n38. When envoys are sent with compliments in their mouths, it is a sign\r\nthat the enemy wishes for a truce.\r\n\r\n[Tu Mu says: \"If the enemy open friendly relations be sending hostages,\r\nit is a sign that they are anxious for an armistice, either because\r\ntheir strength is exhausted or for some other reason.\" But it hardly\r\nneeds a Sun Tzŭ to draw such an obvious inference.]\r\n\r\n\r\n39. If the enemy’s troops march up angrily and remain facing ours for a\r\nlong time without either joining battle or taking themselves off again,\r\nthe situation is one that demands great vigilance and circumspection.\r\n\r\n[Ts’ao Kung says a manœuver of this sort may be only a ruse to gain\r\ntime for an unexpected flank attack or the laying of an ambush.]\r\n\r\n\r\n40. If our troops are no more in number than the enemy, that is amply\r\nsufficient; it only means that no direct attack can be made.\r\n\r\n[Literally, \"no martial advance.\" That is to say, _cheng_ tactics and\r\nfrontal attacks must be eschewed, and stratagem resorted to instead.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat we can do is simply to concentrate all our available strength,\r\nkeep a close watch on the enemy, and obtain reinforcements.\r\n\r\n[This is an obscure sentence, and none of the commentators succeed in\r\nsqueezing very good sense out of it. I follow Li Ch’uan, who appears to\r\noffer the simplest explanation: \"Only the side that gets more men will\r\nwin.\" Fortunately we have Chang Yu to expound its meaning to us in\r\nlanguage which is lucidity itself: \"When the numbers are even, and no\r\nfavourable opening presents itself, although we may not be strong enough\r\nto deliver a sustained attack, we can find additional recruits amongst\r\nour sutlers and camp-followers, and then, concentrating our forces and\r\nkeeping a close watch on the enemy, contrive to snatch the victory. But\r\nwe must avoid borrowing foreign soldiers to help us.\" He then quotes\r\nfrom Wei Liao Tzŭ, ch. 3: \"The nominal strength of mercenary troops may\r\nbe 100,000, but their real value will be not more than half that\r\nfigure.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n41. He who exercises no forethought but makes light of his opponents is\r\nsure to be captured by them.\r\n\r\n[Ch’en Hao, quoting from the _Tso Chuan_, says: \"If bees and scorpions\r\ncarry poison, how much more will a hostile state! Even a puny opponent,\r\nthen, should not be treated with contempt.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n42. If soldiers are punished before they have grown attached to you,\r\nthey will not prove submissive; and, unless submissive, then will be\r\npractically useless. If, when the soldiers have become attached to you,\r\npunishments are not enforced, they will still be useless.\r\n\r\n43. Therefore soldiers must be treated in the first instance with\r\nhumanity, but kept under control by means of iron discipline.\r\n\r\n[Yen Tzŭ [B.C. 493] said of Ssu-ma Jang-chu: \"His civil virtues\r\nendeared him to the people; his martial prowess kept his enemies in\r\nawe.\" Cf. Wu Tzŭ, ch. 4 init.: \"The ideal commander unites culture with\r\na warlike temper; the profession of arms requires a combination of\r\nhardness and tenderness.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a certain road to victory.\r\n\r\n44. If in training soldiers commands are habitually enforced, the army\r\nwill be well-disciplined; if not, its discipline will be bad.\r\n\r\n45. If a general shows confidence in his men but always insists on his\r\norders being obeyed,\r\n\r\n[Tu Mu says: \"A general ought in time of peace to show kindly\r\nconfidence in his men and also make his authority respected, so that\r\nwhen they come to face the enemy, orders may be executed and discipline\r\nmaintained, because they all trust and look up to him.\" What Sun Tzŭ\r\nhas said in § 44, however, would lead one rather to expect something\r\nlike this: \"If a general is always confident that his orders will be\r\ncarried out,\" etc.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nthe gain will be mutual.\r\n\r\n[Chang Yu says: \"The general has confidence in the men under his\r\ncommand, and the men are docile, having confidence in him. Thus the\r\ngain is mutual.\" He quotes a pregnant sentence from Wei Liao Tzŭ, ch.\r\n4: \"The art of giving orders is not to try to rectify minor blunders\r\nand not to be swayed by petty doubts.\" Vacillation and fussiness are\r\nthe surest means of sapping the confidence of an army.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] \"Aids to Scouting,\" p. 26.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter X. TERRAIN\r\n\r\n[Only about a third of the chapter, comprising §§ 1-13, deals with\r\n\"terrain,\" the subject being more fully treated in ch. XI. The \"six\r\ncalamities\" are discussed in §§ 14-20, and the rest of the chapter is\r\nagain a mere string of desultory remarks, though not less interesting,\r\nperhaps, on that account.]\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Sun Tzŭ said: We may distinguish six kinds of terrain, to wit: (1)\r\nAccessible ground;\r\n\r\n[Mei Yao-ch’en says: \"plentifully provided with roads and means of\r\ncommunications.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n(2) entangling ground;\r\n\r\n[The same commentator says: \"Net-like country, venturing into which you\r\nbecome entangled.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n(3) temporising ground;\r\n\r\n[Ground which allows you to \"stave off\" or \"delay.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n(4) narrow passes; (5) precipitous heights; (6) positions at a great\r\ndistance from the enemy.\r\n\r\n[It is hardly necessary to point out the faultiness of this\r\nclassification. A strange lack of logical perception is shown in the\r\nChinaman’s unquestioning acceptance of glaring cross-divisions such as\r\nthe above.]\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Ground which can be freely traversed by both sides is called\r\n_accessible_.\r\n\r\n3. With regard to ground of this nature, be before the enemy in\r\noccupying the raised and sunny spots, and carefully guard your line of\r\nsupplies.\r\n\r\n[The general meaning of the last phrase is doubtlessly, as Tu Yu says,\r\n\"not to allow the enemy to cut your communications.\" In view of\r\nNapoleon’s dictum, \"the secret of war lies in the communications,\" [1]\r\nwe could wish that Sun Tzŭ had done more than skirt the edge of this\r\nimportant subject here and in I. § 10, VII. § 11. Col. Henderson says:\r\n\"The line of supply may be said to be as vital to the existence of an\r\narmy as the heart to the life of a human being. Just as the duelist who\r\nfinds his adversary’s point menacing him with certain death, and his\r\nown guard astray, is compelled to conform to his adversary’s movements,\r\nand to content himself with warding off his thrusts, so the commander\r\nwhose communications are suddenly threatened finds himself in a false\r\nposition, and he will be fortunate if he has not to change all his\r\nplans, to split up his force into more or less isolated detachments,\r\nand to fight with inferior numbers on ground which he has not had time\r\nto prepare, and where defeat will not be an ordinary failure, but will\r\nentail the ruin or surrender of his whole army.\" [2]\r\n\r\n\r\nThen you will be able to fight with advantage.\r\n\r\n4. Ground which can be abandoned but is hard to re-occupy is called\r\n_entangling_.\r\n\r\n5. From a position of this sort, if the enemy is unprepared, you may\r\nsally forth and defeat him. But if the enemy is prepared for your\r\ncoming, and you fail to defeat him, then, return being impossible,\r\ndisaster will ensue.\r\n\r\n6. When the position is such that neither side will gain by making the\r\nfirst move, it is called _temporising_ ground.\r\n\r\n[Tu Mu says: \"Each side finds it inconvenient to move, and the\r\nsituation remains at a deadlock.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n7. In a position of this sort, even though the enemy should offer us an\r\nattractive bait,\r\n\r\n[Tu Yu says, \"turning their backs on us and pretending to flee.\" But\r\nthis is only one of the lures which might induce us to quit our\r\nposition.]\r\n\r\n\r\nit will be advisable not to stir forth, but rather to retreat, thus\r\nenticing the enemy in his turn; then, when part of his army has come\r\nout, we may deliver our attack with advantage.\r\n\r\n8. With regard to _narrow passes_, if you can occupy them first, let\r\nthem be strongly garrisoned and await the advent of the enemy.\r\n\r\n[Because then, as Tu Yu observes, \"the initiative will lie with us, and\r\nby making sudden and unexpected attacks we shall have the enemy at our\r\nmercy.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n9. Should the enemy forestall you in occupying a pass, do not go after\r\nhim if the pass is fully garrisoned, but only if it is weakly\r\ngarrisoned.\r\n\r\n10. With regard to _precipitous heights_, if you are beforehand with\r\nyour adversary, you should occupy the raised and sunny spots, and there\r\nwait for him to come up.\r\n\r\n[Ts’ao Kung says: \"The particular advantage of securing heights and\r\ndefiles is that your actions cannot then be dictated by the enemy.\"\r\n[For the enunciation of the grand principle alluded to, see VI. § 2].\r\nChang Yu tells the following anecdote of P’ei Hsing-chien (A.D.\r\n619-682), who was sent on a punitive expedition against the Turkic\r\ntribes. \"At night he pitched his camp as usual, and it had already been\r\ncompletely fortified by wall and ditch, when suddenly he gave orders\r\nthat the army should shift its quarters to a hill near by. This was\r\nhighly displeasing to his officers, who protested loudly against the\r\nextra fatigue which it would entail on the men. P’ei Hsing-chien,\r\nhowever, paid no heed to their remonstrances and had the camp moved as\r\nquickly as possible. The same night, a terrific storm came on, which\r\nflooded their former place of encampment to the depth of over twelve\r\nfeet. The recalcitrant officers were amazed at the sight, and owned\r\nthat they had been in the wrong. ‘How did you know what was going to\r\nhappen?’ they asked. P’ei Hsing-chien replied: ‘From this time forward\r\nbe content to obey orders without asking unnecessary questions.’ From\r\nthis it may be seen,\" Chang Yu continues, \"that high and sunny places\r\nare advantageous not only for fighting, but also because they are\r\nimmune from disastrous floods.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n11. If the enemy has occupied them before you, do not follow him, but\r\nretreat and try to entice him away.\r\n\r\n[The turning point of Li Shih-min’s campaign in 621 A.D. against the\r\ntwo rebels, Tou Chien-te, King of Hsia, and Wang Shih-ch’ung, Prince of\r\nCheng, was his seizure of the heights of Wu-lao, in spite of which Tou\r\nChien-te persisted in his attempt to relieve his ally in Lo-yang, was\r\ndefeated and taken prisoner. See _Chiu T’ang Shu_, ch. 2, fol. 5 verso,\r\nand also ch. 54.]\r\n\r\n\r\n12. If you are situated at a great distance from the enemy, and the\r\nstrength of the two armies is equal, it is not easy to provoke a\r\nbattle,\r\n\r\n[The point is that we must not think of undertaking a long and\r\nwearisome march, at the end of which, as Tu Yu says, \"we should be\r\nexhausted and our adversary fresh and keen.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nand fighting will be to your disadvantage.\r\n\r\n13. These six are the principles connected with Earth.\r\n\r\n[Or perhaps, \"the principles relating to ground.\" See, however, I. §\r\n8.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe general who has attained a responsible post must be careful to\r\nstudy them.\r\n\r\n14. Now an army is exposed to six several calamities, not arising from\r\nnatural causes, but from faults for which the general is responsible.\r\nThese are: (1) Flight; (2) insubordination; (3) collapse; (4) ruin; (5)\r\ndisorganisation; (6) rout.\r\n\r\n15. Other conditions being equal, if one force is hurled against\r\nanother ten times its size, the result will be the _flight_ of the\r\nformer.\r\n\r\n16. When the common soldiers are too strong and their officers too\r\nweak, the result is _insubordination_.\r\n\r\n[Tu Mu cites the unhappy case of T’ien Pu [_Hsin T’ang Shu_, ch. 148],\r\nwho was sent to Wei in 821 A.D. with orders to lead an army against\r\nWang T’ing-ts’ou. But the whole time he was in command, his soldiers\r\ntreated him with the utmost contempt, and openly flouted his authority\r\nby riding about the camp on donkeys, several thousands at a time. T’ien\r\nPu was powerless to put a stop to this conduct, and when, after some\r\nmonths had passed, he made an attempt to engage the enemy, his troops\r\nturned tail and dispersed in every direction. After that, the\r\nunfortunate man committed suicide by cutting his throat.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the officers are too strong and the common soldiers too weak, the\r\nresult is _collapse_.\r\n\r\n[Ts’ao Kung says: \"The officers are energetic and want to press on, the\r\ncommon soldiers are feeble and suddenly collapse.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n17. When the higher officers are angry and insubordinate, and on\r\nmeeting the enemy give battle on their own account from a feeling of\r\nresentment, before the commander-in-chief can tell whether or no he is\r\nin a position to fight, the result is _ruin_.\r\n\r\n[Wang Hsi’s note is: \"This means, the general is angry without cause,\r\nand at the same time does not appreciate the ability of his subordinate\r\nofficers; thus he arouses fierce resentment and brings an avalanche of\r\nruin upon his head.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n18. When the general is weak and without authority; when his orders are\r\nnot clear and distinct;\r\n\r\n[Wei Liao Tzŭ (ch. 4) says: \"If the commander gives his orders with\r\ndecision, the soldiers will not wait to hear them twice; if his moves\r\nare made without vacillation, the soldiers will not be in two minds\r\nabout doing their duty.\" General Baden-Powell says, italicizing the\r\nwords: \"The secret of getting successful work out of your trained men\r\nlies in one nutshell—in the clearness of the instructions they\r\nreceive.\" [3] Cf. also Wu Tzŭ ch. 3: \"the most fatal defect in a\r\nmilitary leader is difference; the worst calamities that befall an army\r\narise from hesitation.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nwhen there are no fixed duties assigned to officers and men,\r\n\r\n[Tu Mu says: \"Neither officers nor men have any regular routine.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nand the ranks are formed in a slovenly haphazard manner, the result is\r\nutter _disorganisation_.\r\n\r\n19. When a general, unable to estimate the enemy’s strength, allows an\r\ninferior force to engage a larger one, or hurls a weak detachment\r\nagainst a powerful one, and neglects to place picked soldiers in the\r\nfront rank, the result must be a _rout_.\r\n\r\n[Chang Yu paraphrases the latter part of the sentence and continues:\r\n\"Whenever there is fighting to be done, the keenest spirits should be\r\nappointed to serve in the front ranks, both in order to strengthen the\r\nresolution of our own men and to demoralize the enemy.\" Cf. the primi\r\nordines of Caesar (\"De Bello Gallico,\" V. 28, 44, et al.).]\r\n\r\n\r\n20. These are six ways of courting defeat, which must be carefully\r\nnoted by the general who has attained a responsible post.\r\n\r\n[See _supra_, § 13.]\r\n\r\n\r\n21. The natural formation of the country is the soldier’s best ally;\r\n\r\n[Ch’en Hao says: \"The advantages of weather and season are not equal to\r\nthose connected with ground.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nbut a power of estimating the adversary, of controlling the forces of\r\nvictory, and of shrewdly calculating difficulties, dangers and\r\ndistances, constitutes the test of a great general.\r\n\r\n22. He who knows these things, and in fighting puts his knowledge into\r\npractice, will win his battles. He who knows them not, nor practises\r\nthem, will surely be defeated.\r\n\r\n23. If fighting is sure to result in victory, then you must fight, even\r\nthough the ruler forbid it; if fighting will not result in victory,\r\nthen you must not fight even at the ruler’s bidding.\r\n\r\n[Cf. VIII. § 3 fin. Huang Shih-kung of the Ch’in dynasty, who is said\r\nto have been the patron of Chang Liang and to have written the _San\r\nLueh_, has these words attributed to him: \"The responsibility of\r\nsetting an army in motion must devolve on the general alone; if advance\r\nand retreat are controlled from the Palace, brilliant results will\r\nhardly be achieved. Hence the god-like ruler and the enlightened\r\nmonarch are content to play a humble part in furthering their country’s\r\ncause [lit., kneel down to push the chariot wheel].\" This means that\r\n\"in matters lying outside the zenana, the decision of the military\r\ncommander must be absolute.\" Chang Yu also quote the saying: \"Decrees\r\nfrom the Son of Heaven do not penetrate the walls of a camp.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n24. The general who advances without coveting fame and retreats without\r\nfearing disgrace,\r\n\r\n[It was Wellington, I think, who said that the hardest thing of all for\r\na soldier is to retreat.]\r\n\r\n\r\nwhose only thought is to protect his country and do good service for\r\nhis sovereign, is the jewel of the kingdom.\r\n\r\n[A noble presentiment, in few words, of the Chinese \"happy warrior.\"\r\nSuch a man, says Ho Shih, \"even if he had to suffer punishment, would\r\nnot regret his conduct.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n25. Regard your soldiers as your children, and they will follow you\r\ninto the deepest valleys; look on them as your own beloved sons, and\r\nthey will stand by you even unto death.\r\n\r\n[Cf. I. § 6. In this connection, Tu Mu draws for us an engaging picture\r\nof the famous general Wu Ch’i, from whose treatise on war I have\r\nfrequently had occasion to quote: \"He wore the same clothes and ate the\r\nsame food as the meanest of his soldiers, refused to have either a\r\nhorse to ride or a mat to sleep on, carried his own surplus rations\r\nwrapped in a parcel, and shared every hardship with his men. One of his\r\nsoldiers was suffering from an abscess, and Wu Ch’i himself sucked out\r\nthe virus. The soldier’s mother, hearing this, began wailing and\r\nlamenting. Somebody asked her, saying: ‘Why do you cry? Your son is\r\nonly a common soldier, and yet the commander-in-chief himself has\r\nsucked the poison from his sore.’ The woman replied, ‘Many years ago,\r\nLord Wu performed a similar service for my husband, who never left him\r\nafterwards, and finally met his death at the hands of the enemy. And\r\nnow that he has done the same for my son, he too will fall fighting I\r\nknow not where.’\" Li Ch’uan mentions the Viscount of Ch’u, who invaded\r\nthe small state of Hsiao during the winter. The Duke of Shen said to\r\nhim: \"Many of the soldiers are suffering severely from the cold.\" So he\r\nmade a round of the whole army, comforting and encouraging the men; and\r\nstraightway they felt as if they were clothed in garments lined with\r\nfloss silk.]\r\n\r\n\r\n26. If, however, you are indulgent, but unable to make your authority\r\nfelt; kind-hearted, but unable to enforce your commands; and incapable,\r\nmoreover, of quelling disorder: then your soldiers must be likened to\r\nspoilt children; they are useless for any practical purpose.\r\n\r\n[Li Ching once said that if you could make your soldiers afraid of you,\r\nthey would not be afraid of the enemy. Tu Mu recalls an instance of\r\nstern military discipline which occurred in 219 A.D., when Lu Meng was\r\noccupying the town of Chiang-ling. He had given stringent orders to his\r\narmy not to molest the inhabitants nor take anything from them by\r\nforce. Nevertheless, a certain officer serving under his banner, who\r\nhappened to be a fellow-townsman, ventured to appropriate a bamboo hat\r\nbelonging to one of the people, in order to wear it over his regulation\r\nhelmet as a protection against the rain. Lu Meng considered that the\r\nfact of his being also a native of Ju-nan should not be allowed to\r\npalliate a clear breach of discipline, and accordingly he ordered his\r\nsummary execution, the tears rolling down his face, however, as he did\r\nso. This act of severity filled the army with wholesome awe, and from\r\nthat time forth even articles dropped in the highway were not picked\r\nup.]\r\n\r\n\r\n27. If we know that our own men are in a condition to attack, but are\r\nunaware that the enemy is not open to attack, we have gone only halfway\r\ntowards victory.\r\n\r\n[That is, Ts’ao Kung says, \"the issue in this case is uncertain.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n28. If we know that the enemy is open to attack, but are unaware that\r\nour own men are not in a condition to attack, we have gone only halfway\r\ntowards victory.\r\n\r\n[Cf. III. § 13 (1).]\r\n\r\n\r\n29. If we know that the enemy is open to attack, and also know that our\r\nmen are in a condition to attack, but are unaware that the nature of\r\nthe ground makes fighting impracticable, we have still gone only\r\nhalfway towards victory.\r\n\r\n30. Hence the experienced soldier, once in motion, is never bewildered;\r\nonce he has broken camp, he is never at a loss.\r\n\r\n[The reason being, according to Tu Mu, that he has taken his measures\r\nso thoroughly as to ensure victory beforehand. \"He does not move\r\nrecklessly,\" says Chang Yu, \"so that when he does move, he makes no\r\nmistakes.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n31. Hence the saying: If you know the enemy and know yourself, your\r\nvictory will not stand in doubt; if you know Heaven and know Earth, you\r\nmay make your victory complete.\r\n\r\n[Li Ch’uan sums up as follows: \"Given a knowledge of three things—the\r\naffairs of men, the seasons of heaven and the natural advantages of\r\nearth—, victory will invariably crown your battles.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] See \"Pensees de Napoleon 1er,\" no. 47.\r\n\r\n[2] \"The Science of War,\" chap. 2.\r\n\r\n[3] \"Aids to Scouting,\" p. xii.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XI. THE NINE SITUATIONS\r\n\r\n1. Sun Tzŭ said: The art of war recognises nine varieties of ground:\r\n(1) Dispersive ground; (2) facile ground; (3) contentious ground; (4)\r\nopen ground; (5) ground of intersecting highways; (6) serious ground;\r\n(7) difficult ground; (8) hemmed-in ground; (9) desperate ground.\r\n\r\n2. When a chieftain is fighting in his own territory, it is dispersive\r\nground.\r\n\r\n[So called because the soldiers, being near to their homes and anxious\r\nto see their wives and children, are likely to seize the opportunity\r\nafforded by a battle and scatter in every direction. \"In their\r\nadvance,\" observes Tu Mu, \"they will lack the valor of desperation, and\r\nwhen they retreat, they will find harbors of refuge.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n3. When he has penetrated into hostile territory, but to no great\r\ndistance, it is facile ground.\r\n\r\n[Li Ch’uan and Ho Shih say \"because of the facility for retreating,\"\r\nand the other commentators give similar explanations. Tu Mu remarks:\r\n\"When your army has crossed the border, you should burn your boats and\r\nbridges, in order to make it clear to everybody that you have no\r\nhankering after home.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Ground the possession of which imports great advantage to either\r\nside, is contentious ground.\r\n\r\n[Tu Mu defines the ground as ground \"to be contended for.\" Ts’ao Kung\r\nsays: \"ground on which the few and the weak can defeat the many and the\r\nstrong,\" such as \"the neck of a pass,\" instanced by Li Ch’uan. Thus,\r\nThermopylae was of this classification because the possession of it,\r\neven for a few days only, meant holding the entire invading army in\r\ncheck and thus gaining invaluable time. Cf. Wu Tzŭ, ch. V. ad init.:\r\n\"For those who have to fight in the ratio of one to ten, there is\r\nnothing better than a narrow pass.\" When Lu Kuang was returning from\r\nhis triumphant expedition to Turkestan in 385 A.D., and had got as far\r\nas I-ho, laden with spoils, Liang Hsi, administrator of Liang-chou,\r\ntaking advantage of the death of Fu Chien, King of Ch’in, plotted\r\nagainst him and was for barring his way into the province. Yang Han,\r\ngovernor of Kao-ch’ang, counseled him, saying: \"Lu Kuang is fresh from\r\nhis victories in the west, and his soldiers are vigorous and\r\nmettlesome. If we oppose him in the shifting sands of the desert, we\r\nshall be no match for him, and we must therefore try a different plan.\r\nLet us hasten to occupy the defile at the mouth of the Kao-wu pass,\r\nthus cutting him off from supplies of water, and when his troops are\r\nprostrated with thirst, we can dictate our own terms without moving. Or\r\nif you think that the pass I mention is too far off, we could make a\r\nstand against him at the I-wu pass, which is nearer. The cunning and\r\nresource of Tzŭ-fang himself would be expended in vain against the\r\nenormous strength of these two positions.\" Liang Hsi, refusing to act\r\non this advice, was overwhelmed and swept away by the invader.]\r\n\r\n\r\n5. Ground on which each side has liberty of movement is open ground.\r\n\r\n[There are various interpretations of the Chinese adjective for this\r\ntype of ground. Ts’ao Kung says it means \"ground covered with a network\r\nof roads,\" like a chessboard. Ho Shih suggested: \"ground on which\r\nintercommunication is easy.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n6. Ground which forms the key to three contiguous states,\r\n\r\n[Ts’au Kung defines this as: \"Our country adjoining the enemy’s and a\r\nthird country conterminous with both.\" Meng Shih instances the small\r\nprincipality of Cheng, which was bounded on the north-east by Ch’i, on\r\nthe west by Chin, and on the south by Ch’u.]\r\n\r\n\r\nso that he who occupies it first has most of the Empire at his command,\r\n\r\n[The belligerent who holds this dominating position can constrain most\r\nof them to become his allies.]\r\n\r\n\r\nis ground of intersecting highways.\r\n\r\n7. When an army has penetrated into the heart of a hostile country,\r\nleaving a number of fortified cities in its rear, it is serious ground.\r\n\r\n[Wang Hsi explains the name by saying that \"when an army has reached\r\nsuch a point, its situation is serious.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n8. Mountain forests,\r\n\r\n[Or simply \"forests.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nrugged steeps, marshes and fens—all country that is hard to traverse:\r\nthis is difficult ground.\r\n\r\n9. Ground which is reached through narrow gorges, and from which we can\r\nonly retire by tortuous paths, so that a small number of the enemy\r\nwould suffice to crush a large body of our men: this is hemmed in\r\nground.\r\n\r\n10. Ground on which we can only be saved from destruction by fighting\r\nwithout delay, is desperate ground.\r\n\r\n[The situation, as pictured by Ts’ao Kung, is very similar to the\r\n\"hemmed-in ground\" except that here escape is no longer possible: \"A\r\nlofty mountain in front, a large river behind, advance impossible,\r\nretreat blocked.\" Ch’en Hao says: \"to be on ‘desperate ground’ is like\r\nsitting in a leaking boat or crouching in a burning house.\" Tu Mu\r\nquotes from Li Ching a vivid description of the plight of an army thus\r\nentrapped: \"Suppose an army invading hostile territory without the aid\r\nof local guides:—it falls into a fatal snare and is at the enemy’s\r\nmercy. A ravine on the left, a mountain on the right, a pathway so\r\nperilous that the horses have to be roped together and the chariots\r\ncarried in slings, no passage open in front, retreat cut off behind, no\r\nchoice but to proceed in single file. Then, before there is time to\r\nrange our soldiers in order of battle, the enemy is overwhelming\r\nstrength suddenly appears on the scene. Advancing, we can nowhere take\r\na breathing-space; retreating, we have no haven of refuge. We seek a\r\npitched battle, but in vain; yet standing on the defensive, none of us\r\nhas a moment’s respite. If we simply maintain our ground, whole days\r\nand months will crawl by; the moment we make a move, we have to sustain\r\nthe enemy’s attacks on front and rear. The country is wild, destitute\r\nof water and plants; the army is lacking in the necessaries of life,\r\nthe horses are jaded and the men worn-out, all the resources of\r\nstrength and skill unavailing, the pass so narrow that a single man\r\ndefending it can check the onset of ten thousand; all means of offense\r\nin the hands of the enemy, all points of vantage already forfeited by\r\nourselves:—in this terrible plight, even though we had the most valiant\r\nsoldiers and the keenest of weapons, how could they be employed with\r\nthe slightest effect?\" Students of Greek history may be reminded of the\r\nawful close to the Sicilian expedition, and the agony of the Athenians\r\nunder Nicias and Demonsthenes. [See Thucydides, VII. 78 sqq.].]\r\n\r\n\r\n11. On dispersive ground, therefore, fight not. On facile ground, halt\r\nnot. On contentious ground, attack not.\r\n\r\n[But rather let all your energies be bent on occupying the advantageous\r\nposition first. So Ts’ao Kung. Li Ch’uan and others, however, suppose\r\nthe meaning to be that the enemy has already forestalled us, sot that\r\nit would be sheer madness to attack. In the _Sun Tzŭ Hsu Lu_, when the\r\nKing of Wu inquires what should be done in this case, Sun Tzŭ replies:\r\n\"The rule with regard to contentious ground is that those in possession\r\nhave the advantage over the other side. If a position of this kind is\r\nsecured first by the enemy, beware of attacking him. Lure him away by\r\npretending to flee—show your banners and sound your drums—make a dash\r\nfor other places that he cannot afford to lose—trail brushwood and\r\nraise a dust—confound his ears and eyes—detach a body of your best\r\ntroops, and place it secretly in ambuscade. Then your opponent will\r\nsally forth to the rescue.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n12. On open ground, do not try to block the enemy’s way.\r\n\r\n[Because the attempt would be futile, and would expose the blocking\r\nforce itself to serious risks. There are two interpretations available\r\nhere. I follow that of Chang Yu. The other is indicated in Ts’ao Kung’s\r\nbrief note: \"Draw closer together\"—i.e., see that a portion of your own\r\narmy is not cut off.]\r\n\r\n\r\nOn ground of intersecting highways, join hands with your allies.\r\n\r\n[Or perhaps, \"form alliances with neighbouring states.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n13. On serious ground, gather in plunder.\r\n\r\n[On this, Li Ch’uan has the following delicious note: \"When an army\r\npenetrates far into the enemy’s country, care must be taken not to\r\nalienate the people by unjust treatment. Follow the example of the Han\r\nEmperor Kao Tsu, whose march into Ch’in territory was marked by no\r\nviolation of women or looting of valuables. [Nota bene: this was in 207\r\nB.C., and may well cause us to blush for the Christian armies that\r\nentered Peking in 1900 A.D.] Thus he won the hearts of all. In the\r\npresent passage, then, I think that the true reading must be, not\r\n‘plunder,’ but ‘do not plunder.’\" Alas, I fear that in this instance\r\nthe worthy commentator’s feelings outran his judgment. Tu Mu, at least,\r\nhas no such illusions. He says: \"When encamped on ‘serious ground,’\r\nthere being no inducement as yet to advance further, and no possibility\r\nof retreat, one ought to take measures for a protracted resistance by\r\nbringing in provisions from all sides, and keep a close watch on the\r\nenemy.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn difficult ground, keep steadily on the march.\r\n\r\n[Or, in the words of VIII. § 2, \"do not encamp.]\r\n\r\n\r\n14. On hemmed-in ground, resort to stratagem.\r\n\r\n[Ts’au Kung says: \"Try the effect of some unusual artifice;\" and Tu Yu\r\namplifies this by saying: \"In such a position, some scheme must be\r\ndevised which will suit the circumstances, and if we can succeed in\r\ndeluding the enemy, the peril may be escaped.\" This is exactly what\r\nhappened on the famous occasion when Hannibal was hemmed in among the\r\nmountains on the road to Casilinum, and to all appearances entrapped by\r\nthe dictator Fabius. The stratagem which Hannibal devised to baffle his\r\nfoes was remarkably like that which T’ien Tan had also employed with\r\nsuccess exactly 62 years before. [See IX. § 24, note.] When night came\r\non, bundles of twigs were fastened to the horns of some 2000 oxen and\r\nset on fire, the terrified animals being then quickly driven along the\r\nmountain side towards the passes which were beset by the enemy. The\r\nstrange spectacle of these rapidly moving lights so alarmed and\r\ndiscomfited the Romans that they withdrew from their position, and\r\nHannibal’s army passed safely through the defile. [See Polybius, III.\r\n93, 94; Livy, XXII. 16 17.]\r\n\r\n\r\nOn desperate ground, fight.\r\n\r\n[For, as Chia Lin remarks: \"if you fight with all your might, there is\r\na chance of life; where as death is certain if you cling to your\r\ncorner.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n15. Those who were called skilful leaders of old knew how to drive a\r\nwedge between the enemy’s front and rear;\r\n\r\n[More literally, \"cause the front and rear to lose touch with each\r\nother.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nto prevent co-operation between his large and small divisions; to\r\nhinder the good troops from rescuing the bad, the officers from\r\nrallying their men.\r\n\r\n16. When the enemy’s men were scattered, they prevented them from\r\nconcentrating; even when their forces were united, they managed to keep\r\nthem in disorder.\r\n\r\n17. When it was to their advantage, they made a forward move; when\r\notherwise, they stopped still.\r\n\r\n[Mei Yao-ch’en connects this with the foregoing: \"Having succeeded in\r\nthus dislocating the enemy, they would push forward in order to secure\r\nany advantage to be gained; if there was no advantage to be gained,\r\nthey would remain where they were.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n18. If asked how to cope with a great host of the enemy in orderly\r\narray and on the point of marching to the attack, I should say: \"Begin\r\nby seizing something which your opponent holds dear; then he will be\r\namenable to your will.\"\r\n\r\n[Opinions differ as to what Sun Tzŭ had in mind. Ts’ao Kung thinks it\r\nis \"some strategical advantage on which the enemy is depending.\" Tu Mu\r\nsays: \"The three things which an enemy is anxious to do, and on the\r\naccomplishment of which his success depends, are: (1) to capture our\r\nfavourable positions; (2) to ravage our cultivated land; (3) to guard\r\nhis own communications.\" Our object then must be to thwart his plans in\r\nthese three directions and thus render him helpless. [Cf. III. § 3.] By\r\nboldly seizing the initiative in this way, you at once throw the other\r\nside on the defensive.]\r\n\r\n\r\n19. Rapidity is the essence of war:\r\n\r\n[According to Tu Mu, \"this is a summary of leading principles in\r\nwarfare,\" and he adds: \"These are the profoundest truths of military\r\nscience, and the chief business of the general.\" The following\r\nanecdotes, told by Ho Shih, shows the importance attached to speed by\r\ntwo of China’s greatest generals. In 227 A.D., Meng Ta, governor of\r\nHsin-ch’eng under the Wei Emperor Wen Ti, was meditating defection to\r\nthe House of Shu, and had entered into correspondence with Chu-ko\r\nLiang, Prime Minister of that State. The Wei general Ssu-ma I was then\r\nmilitary governor of Wan, and getting wind of Meng Ta’s treachery, he\r\nat once set off with an army to anticipate his revolt, having\r\npreviously cajoled him by a specious message of friendly import.\r\nSsu-ma’s officers came to him and said: \"If Meng Ta has leagued himself\r\nwith Wu and Shu, the matter should be thoroughly investigated before we\r\nmake a move.\" Ssu-ma I replied: \"Meng Ta is an unprincipled man, and we\r\nought to go and punish him at once, while he is still wavering and\r\nbefore he has thrown off the mask.\" Then, by a series of forced\r\nmarches, be brought his army under the walls of Hsin-ch’eng with in a\r\nspace of eight days. Now Meng Ta had previously said in a letter to\r\nChu-ko Liang: \"Wan is 1200 _li_ from here. When the news of my revolt\r\nreaches Ssu-ma I, he will at once inform his imperial master, but it\r\nwill be a whole month before any steps can be taken, and by that time\r\nmy city will be well fortified. Besides, Ssu-ma I is sure not to come\r\nhimself, and the generals that will be sent against us are not worth\r\ntroubling about.\" The next letter, however, was filled with\r\nconsternation: \"Though only eight days have passed since I threw off my\r\nallegiance, an army is already at the city-gates. What miraculous\r\nrapidity is this!\" A fortnight later, Hsin- ch’eng had fallen and Meng\r\nTa had lost his head. [See _Chin Shu_, ch. 1, f. 3.] In 621 A.D., Li\r\nChing was sent from K’uei-chou in Ssu-ch’uan to reduce the successful\r\nrebel Hsiao Hsien, who had set up as Emperor at the modern Ching-chou\r\nFu in Hupeh. It was autumn, and the Yangtsze being then in flood, Hsiao\r\nHsien never dreamt that his adversary would venture to come down\r\nthrough the gorges, and consequently made no preparations. But Li Ching\r\nembarked his army without loss of time, and was just about to start\r\nwhen the other generals implored him to postpone his departure until\r\nthe river was in a less dangerous state for navigation. Li Ching\r\nreplied: \"To the soldier, overwhelming speed is of paramount\r\nimportance, and he must never miss opportunities. Now is the time to\r\nstrike, before Hsiao Hsien even knows that we have got an army\r\ntogether. If we seize the present moment when the river is in flood, we\r\nshall appear before his capital with startling suddenness, like the\r\nthunder which is heard before you have time to stop your ears against\r\nit. [See VII. § 19, note.] This is the great principle in war. Even if\r\nhe gets to know of our approach, he will have to levy his soldiers in\r\nsuch a hurry that they will not be fit to oppose us. Thus the full\r\nfruits of victory will be ours.\" All came about as he predicted, and\r\nHsiao Hsien was obliged to surrender, nobly stipulating that his people\r\nshould be spared and he alone suffer the penalty of death.]\r\n\r\n\r\ntake advantage of the enemy’s unreadiness, make your way by unexpected\r\nroutes, and attack unguarded spots.\r\n\r\n20. The following are the principles to be observed by an invading\r\nforce: The further you penetrate into a country, the greater will be\r\nthe solidarity of your troops, and thus the defenders will not prevail\r\nagainst you.\r\n\r\n21. Make forays in fertile country in order to supply your army with\r\nfood.\r\n\r\n[Cf. _supra_, § 13. Li Ch’uan does not venture on a note here.]\r\n\r\n\r\n22. Carefully study the well-being of your men,\r\n\r\n[For \"well-being\", Wang Hsi means, \"Pet them, humor them, give them\r\nplenty of food and drink, and look after them generally.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nand do not overtax them. Concentrate your energy and hoard your\r\nstrength.\r\n\r\n[Ch’en recalls the line of action adopted in 224 B.C. by the famous\r\ngeneral Wang Chien, whose military genius largely contributed to the\r\nsuccess of the First Emperor. He had invaded the Ch’u State, where a\r\nuniversal levy was made to oppose him. But, being doubtful of the\r\ntemper of his troops, he declined all invitations to fight and remained\r\nstrictly on the defensive. In vain did the Ch’u general try to force a\r\nbattle: day after day Wang Chien kept inside his walls and would not\r\ncome out, but devoted his whole time and energy to winning the\r\naffection and confidence of his men. He took care that they should be\r\nwell fed, sharing his own meals with them, provided facilities for\r\nbathing, and employed every method of judicious indulgence to weld them\r\ninto a loyal and homogenous body. After some time had elapsed, he told\r\noff certain persons to find out how the men were amusing themselves.\r\nThe answer was, that they were contending with one another in putting\r\nthe weight and long-jumping. When Wang Chien heard that they were\r\nengaged in these athletic pursuits, he knew that their spirits had been\r\nstrung up to the required pitch and that they were now ready for\r\nfighting. By this time the Ch’u army, after repeating their challenge\r\nagain and again, had marched away eastwards in disgust. The Ch’in\r\ngeneral immediately broke up his camp and followed them, and in the\r\nbattle that ensued they were routed with great slaughter. Shortly\r\nafterwards, the whole of Ch’u was conquered by Ch’in, and the king\r\nFu-ch’u led into captivity.]\r\n\r\n\r\nKeep your army continually on the move,\r\n\r\n[In order that the enemy may never know exactly where you are. It has\r\nstruck me, however, that the true reading might be \"link your army\r\ntogether.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nand devise unfathomable plans.\r\n\r\n23. Throw your soldiers into positions whence there is no escape, and\r\nthey will prefer death to flight. If they will face death, there is\r\nnothing they may not achieve.\r\n\r\n[Chang Yu quotes his favourite Wei Liao Tzŭ (ch. 3): \"If one man were to\r\nrun amok with a sword in the market-place, and everybody else tried to\r\nget our of his way, I should not allow that this man alone had courage\r\nand that all the rest were contemptible cowards. The truth is, that a\r\ndesperado and a man who sets some value on his life do not meet on even\r\nterms.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nOfficers and men alike will put forth their uttermost strength.\r\n\r\n[Chang Yu says: \"If they are in an awkward place together, they will\r\nsurely exert their united strength to get out of it.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n24. Soldiers when in desperate straits lose the sense of fear. If there\r\nis no place of refuge, they will stand firm. If they are in the heart\r\nof a hostile country, they will show a stubborn front. If there is no\r\nhelp for it, they will fight hard.\r\n\r\n25. Thus, without waiting to be marshalled, the soldiers will be\r\nconstantly on the _qui vive;_ without waiting to be asked, they will do\r\nyour will;\r\n\r\n[Literally, \"without asking, you will get.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nwithout restrictions, they will be faithful; without giving orders,\r\nthey can be trusted.\r\n\r\n26. Prohibit the taking of omens, and do away with superstitious\r\ndoubts. Then, until death itself comes, no calamity need be feared.\r\n\r\n[The superstitious, \"bound in to saucy doubts and fears,\" degenerate\r\ninto cowards and \"die many times before their deaths.\" Tu Mu quotes\r\nHuang Shih-kung: \"‘Spells and incantations should be strictly\r\nforbidden, and no officer allowed to inquire by divination into the\r\nfortunes of an army, for fear the soldiers’ minds should be seriously\r\nperturbed.’ The meaning is,\" he continues, \"that if all doubts and\r\nscruples are discarded, your men will never falter in their resolution\r\nuntil they die.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n27. If our soldiers are not overburdened with money, it is not because\r\nthey have a distaste for riches; if their lives are not unduly long, it\r\nis not because they are disinclined to longevity.\r\n\r\n[Chang Yu has the best note on this passage: \"Wealth and long life are\r\nthings for which all men have a natural inclination. Hence, if they\r\nburn or fling away valuables, and sacrifice their own lives, it is not\r\nthat they dislike them, but simply that they have no choice.\" Sun Tzŭ\r\nis slyly insinuating that, as soldiers are but human, it is for the\r\ngeneral to see that temptations to shirk fighting and grow rich are not\r\nthrown in their way.]\r\n\r\n\r\n28. On the day they are ordered out to battle, your soldiers may weep,\r\n\r\n[The word in the Chinese is \"snivel.\" This is taken to indicate more\r\ngenuine grief than tears alone.]\r\n\r\n\r\nthose sitting up bedewing their garments, and those lying down letting\r\nthe tears run down their cheeks.\r\n\r\n[Not because they are afraid, but because, as Ts’ao Kung says, \"all\r\nhave embraced the firm resolution to do or die.\" We may remember that\r\nthe heroes of the Iliad were equally childlike in showing their\r\nemotion. Chang Yu alludes to the mournful parting at the I River\r\nbetween Ching K’o and his friends, when the former was sent to attempt\r\nthe life of the King of Ch’in (afterwards First Emperor) in 227 B.C.\r\nThe tears of all flowed down like rain as he bade them farewell and\r\nuttered the following lines: \"The shrill blast is blowing, Chilly the\r\nburn; Your champion is going—Not to return.\" [1] ]\r\n\r\n\r\nBut let them once be brought to bay, and they will display the courage\r\nof a Chu or a Kuei.\r\n\r\n[Chu was the personal name of Chuan Chu, a native of the Wu State and\r\ncontemporary with Sun Tzŭ himself, who was employed by Kung-tzu Kuang,\r\nbetter known as Ho Lu Wang, to assassinate his sovereign Wang Liao with\r\na dagger which he secreted in the belly of a fish served up at a\r\nbanquet. He succeeded in his attempt, but was immediately hacked to\r\npieces by the king’s bodyguard. This was in 515 B.C. The other hero\r\nreferred to, Ts’ao Kuei (or Ts’ao Mo), performed the exploit which has\r\nmade his name famous 166 years earlier, in 681 B.C. Lu had been thrice\r\ndefeated by Ch’i, and was just about to conclude a treaty surrendering\r\na large slice of territory, when Ts’ao Kuei suddenly seized Huan Kung,\r\nthe Duke of Ch’i, as he stood on the altar steps and held a dagger\r\nagainst his chest. None of the duke’s retainers dared to move a muscle,\r\nand Ts’ao Kuei proceeded to demand full restitution, declaring the Lu\r\nwas being unjustly treated because she was a smaller and a weaker\r\nstate. Huan Kung, in peril of his life, was obliged to consent,\r\nwhereupon Ts’ao Kuei flung away his dagger and quietly resumed his\r\nplace amid the terrified assemblage without having so much as changed\r\ncolor. As was to be expected, the Duke wanted afterwards to repudiate\r\nthe bargain, but his wise old counselor Kuan Chung pointed out to him\r\nthe impolicy of breaking his word, and the upshot was that this bold\r\nstroke regained for Lu the whole of what she had lost in three pitched\r\nbattles.]\r\n\r\n\r\n29. The skilful tactician may be likened to the _shuai-jan_. Now the\r\n_shuai-jan_ is a snake that is found in the Ch‘ang mountains.\r\n\r\n[\"_Shuai-jan_\" means \"suddenly\" or \"rapidly,\" and the snake in question\r\nwas doubtless so called owing to the rapidity of its movements. Through\r\nthis passage, the term in the Chinese has now come to be used in the\r\nsense of \"military manœuvers.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nStrike at its head, and you will be attacked by its tail; strike at its\r\ntail, and you will be attacked by its head; strike at its middle, and\r\nyou will be attacked by head and tail both.\r\n\r\n30. Asked if an army can be made to imitate the _shuai-jan_,\r\n\r\n[That is, as Mei Yao-ch’en says, \"Is it possible to make the front and\r\nrear of an army each swiftly responsive to attack on the other, just as\r\nthough they were part of a single living body?\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nI should answer, Yes. For the men of Wu and the men of Yüeh are\r\nenemies;\r\n\r\n[Cf. VI. § 21.]\r\n\r\n\r\nyet if they are crossing a river in the same boat and are caught by a\r\nstorm, they will come to each other’s assistance just as the left hand\r\nhelps the right.\r\n\r\n[The meaning is: If two enemies will help each other in a time of\r\ncommon peril, how much more should two parts of the same army, bound\r\ntogether as they are by every tie of interest and fellow-feeling. Yet\r\nit is notorious that many a campaign has been ruined through lack of\r\ncooperation, especially in the case of allied armies.]\r\n\r\n\r\n31. Hence it is not enough to put one’s trust in the tethering of\r\nhorses, and the burying of chariot wheels in the ground.\r\n\r\n[These quaint devices to prevent one’s army from running away recall\r\nthe Athenian hero Sophanes, who carried the anchor with him at the\r\nbattle of Plataea, by means of which he fastened himself firmly to one\r\nspot. [See Herodotus, IX. 74.] It is not enough, says Sun Tzŭ, to\r\nrender flight impossible by such mechanical means. You will not succeed\r\nunless your men have tenacity and unity of purpose, and, above all, a\r\nspirit of sympathetic cooperation. This is the lesson which can be\r\nlearned from the _shuai-jan_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n32. The principle on which to manage an army is to set up one standard\r\nof courage which all must reach.\r\n\r\n[Literally, \"level the courage [of all] as though [it were that of]\r\none.\" If the ideal army is to form a single organic whole, then it\r\nfollows that the resolution and spirit of its component parts must be\r\nof the same quality, or at any rate must not fall below a certain\r\nstandard. Wellington’s seemingly ungrateful description of his army at\r\nWaterloo as \"the worst he had ever commanded\" meant no more than that\r\nit was deficient in this important particular—unity of spirit and\r\ncourage. Had he not foreseen the Belgian defections and carefully kept\r\nthose troops in the background, he would almost certainly have lost the\r\nday.]\r\n\r\n\r\n33. How to make the best of both strong and weak—that is a question\r\ninvolving the proper use of ground.\r\n\r\n[Mei Yao-ch’en’s paraphrase is: \"The way to eliminate the differences\r\nof strong and weak and to make both serviceable is to utilize\r\naccidental features of the ground.\" Less reliable troops, if posted in\r\nstrong positions, will hold out as long as better troops on more\r\nexposed terrain. The advantage of position neutralizes the inferiority\r\nin stamina and courage. Col. Henderson says: \"With all respect to the\r\ntext books, and to the ordinary tactical teaching, I am inclined to\r\nthink that the study of ground is often overlooked, and that by no\r\nmeans sufficient importance is attached to the selection of positions…\r\nand to the immense advantages that are to be derived, whether you are\r\ndefending or attacking, from the proper utilization of natural\r\nfeatures.\" [2] ]\r\n\r\n\r\n34. Thus the skilful general conducts his army just as though he were\r\nleading a single man, willy-nilly, by the hand.\r\n\r\n[Tu Mu says: \"The simile has reference to the ease with which he does\r\nit.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n35. It is the business of a general to be quiet and thus ensure\r\nsecrecy; upright and just, and thus maintain order.\r\n\r\n36. He must be able to mystify his officers and men by false reports\r\nand appearances,\r\n\r\n[Literally, \"to deceive their eyes and ears.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nand thus keep them in total ignorance.\r\n\r\n[Ts’ao Kung gives us one of his excellent apophthegms: \"The troops must\r\nnot be allowed to share your schemes in the beginning; they may only\r\nrejoice with you over their happy outcome.\" \"To mystify, mislead, and\r\nsurprise the enemy,\" is one of the first principles in war, as had been\r\nfrequently pointed out. But how about the other process—the\r\nmystification of one’s own men? Those who may think that Sun Tzŭ is\r\nover-emphatic on this point would do well to read Col. Henderson’s\r\nremarks on Stonewall Jackson’s Valley campaign: \"The infinite pains,\"\r\nhe says, \"with which Jackson sought to conceal, even from his most\r\ntrusted staff officers, his movements, his intentions, and his\r\nthoughts, a commander less thorough would have pronounced useless\"—etc.\r\netc. [3] In the year 88 A.D., as we read in ch. 47 of the _Hou Han\r\nShu_, \"Pan Ch’ao took the field with 25,000 men from Khotan and other\r\nCentral Asian states with the object of crushing Yarkand. The King of\r\nKutcha replied by dispatching his chief commander to succour the place\r\nwith an army drawn from the kingdoms of Wen-su, Ku-mo, and Wei-t’ou,\r\ntotaling 50,000 men. Pan Ch’ao summoned his officers and also the King\r\nof Khotan to a council of war, and said: ‘Our forces are now\r\noutnumbered and unable to make head against the enemy. The best plan,\r\nthen, is for us to separate and disperse, each in a different\r\ndirection. The King of Khotan will march away by the easterly route,\r\nand I will then return myself towards the west. Let us wait until the\r\nevening drum has sounded and then start.’ Pan Ch’ao now secretly\r\nreleased the prisoners whom he had taken alive, and the King of Kutcha\r\nwas thus informed of his plans. Much elated by the news, the latter set\r\noff at once at the head of 10,000 horsemen to bar Pan Ch’ao’s retreat\r\nin the west, while the King of Wen-su rode eastward with 8000 horse in\r\norder to intercept the King of Khotan. As soon as Pan Ch’ao knew that\r\nthe two chieftains had gone, he called his divisions together, got them\r\nwell in hand, and at cock-crow hurled them against the army of Yarkand,\r\nas it lay encamped. The barbarians, panic-stricken, fled in confusion,\r\nand were closely pursued by Pan Ch’ao. Over 5000 heads were brought\r\nback as trophies, besides immense spoils in the shape of horses and\r\ncattle and valuables of every description. Yarkand then capitulating,\r\nKutcha and the other kingdoms drew off their respective forces. From\r\nthat time forward, Pan Ch’ao’s prestige completely overawed the\r\ncountries of the west.\" In this case, we see that the Chinese general\r\nnot only kept his own officers in ignorance of his real plans, but\r\nactually took the bold step of dividing his army in order to deceive\r\nthe enemy.]\r\n\r\n\r\n37. By altering his arrangements and changing his plans,\r\n\r\n[Wang Hsi thinks that this means not using the same stratagem twice.]\r\n\r\n\r\nhe keeps the enemy without definite knowledge.\r\n\r\n[Chang Yu, in a quotation from another work, says: \"The axiom, that war\r\nis based on deception, does not apply only to deception of the enemy.\r\nYou must deceive even your own soldiers. Make them follow you, but\r\nwithout letting them know why.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nBy shifting his camp and taking circuitous routes, he prevents the\r\nenemy from anticipating his purpose.\r\n\r\n38. At the critical moment, the leader of an army acts like one who has\r\nclimbed up a height and then kicks away the ladder behind him. He\r\ncarries his men deep into hostile territory before he shows his hand.\r\n\r\n[Literally, \"releases the spring\" (see V. § 15), that is, takes some\r\ndecisive step which makes it impossible for the army to return—like\r\nHsiang Yu, who sunk his ships after crossing a river. Ch’en Hao,\r\nfollowed by Chia Lin, understands the words less well as \"puts forth\r\nevery artifice at his command.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n39. He burns his boats and breaks his cooking-pots; like a shepherd\r\ndriving a flock of sheep, he drives his men this way and that, and\r\nnone knows whither he is going.\r\n\r\n[Tu Mu says: \"The army is only cognizant of orders to advance or\r\nretreat; it is ignorant of the ulterior ends of attacking and\r\nconquering.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n40. To muster his host and bring it into danger:—this may be termed the\r\nbusiness of the general.\r\n\r\n[Sun Tzŭ means that after mobilization there should be no delay in\r\naiming a blow at the enemy’s heart. Note how he returns again and again\r\nto this point. Among the warring states of ancient China, desertion was\r\nno doubt a much more present fear and serious evil than it is in the\r\narmies of today.]\r\n\r\n\r\n41. The different measures suited to the nine varieties of ground;\r\n\r\n[Chang Yu says: \"One must not be hide-bound in interpreting the rules\r\nfor the nine varieties of ground.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nthe expediency of aggressive or defensive tactics; and the fundamental\r\nlaws of human nature: these are things that must most certainly be\r\nstudied.\r\n\r\n42. When invading hostile territory, the general principle is, that\r\npenetrating deeply brings cohesion; penetrating but a short way means\r\ndispersion.\r\n\r\n[Cf. _supra_, § 20.]\r\n\r\n\r\n43. When you leave your own country behind, and take your army across\r\nneighbourhood territory, you find yourself on critical ground.\r\n\r\n[This \"ground\" is curiously mentioned in VIII. § 2, but it does not\r\nfigure among the Nine Situations or the Six Calamities in chap. X.\r\nOne’s first impulse would be to translate it distant ground,\" but this,\r\nif we can trust the commentators, is precisely what is not meant here.\r\nMei Yao-ch’en says it is \"a position not far enough advanced to be\r\ncalled ‘facile,’ and not near enough to home to be ‘dispersive,’ but\r\nsomething between the two.\" Wang Hsi says: \"It is ground separated from\r\nhome by an interjacent state, whose territory we have had to cross in\r\norder to reach it. Hence, it is incumbent on us to settle our business\r\nthere quickly.\" He adds that this position is of rare occurrence, which\r\nis the reason why it is not included among the Nine Situations.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen there are means of communication on all four sides, the ground is\r\none of intersecting highways.\r\n\r\n44. When you penetrate deeply into a country, it is serious ground.\r\nWhen you penetrate but a little way, it is facile ground.\r\n\r\n45. When you have the enemy’s strongholds on your rear, and narrow\r\npasses in front, it is hemmed-in ground. When there is no place of\r\nrefuge at all, it is desperate ground.\r\n\r\n46. Therefore, on dispersive ground, I would inspire my men with unity\r\nof purpose.\r\n\r\n[This end, according to Tu Mu, is best attained by remaining on the\r\ndefensive, and avoiding battle. Cf. _supra_, § 11.]\r\n\r\n\r\nOn facile ground, I would see that there is close connection between\r\nall parts of my army.\r\n\r\n[As Tu Mu says, the object is to guard against two possible\r\ncontingencies: \"(1) the desertion of our own troops; (2) a sudden\r\nattack on the part of the enemy.\" Cf. VII. § 17. Mei Yao-ch’en says:\r\n\"On the march, the regiments should be in close touch; in an\r\nencampment, there should be continuity between the fortifications.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n47. On contentious ground, I would hurry up my rear.\r\n\r\n[This is Ts’ao Kung’s interpretation. Chang Yu adopts it, saying: \"We\r\nmust quickly bring up our rear, so that head and tail may both reach\r\nthe goal.\" That is, they must not be allowed to straggle up a long way\r\napart. Mei Yao-ch’en offers another equally plausible explanation:\r\n\"Supposing the enemy has not yet reached the coveted position, and we\r\nare behind him, we should advance with all speed in order to dispute\r\nits possession.\" Ch’en Hao, on the other hand, assuming that the enemy\r\nhas had time to select his own ground, quotes VI. § 1, where Sun Tzŭ\r\nwarns us against coming exhausted to the attack. His own idea of the\r\nsituation is rather vaguely expressed: \"If there is a favourable\r\nposition lying in front of you, detach a picked body of troops to\r\noccupy it, then if the enemy, relying on their numbers, come up to make\r\na fight for it, you may fall quickly on their rear with your main body,\r\nand victory will be assured.\" It was thus, he adds, that Chao She beat\r\nthe army of Ch’in. (See p. 57.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n48. On open ground, I would keep a vigilant eye on my defences. On\r\nground of intersecting highways, I would consolidate my alliances.\r\n\r\n49. On serious ground, I would try to ensure a continuous stream of\r\nsupplies.\r\n\r\n[The commentators take this as referring to forage and plunder, not, as\r\none might expect, to an unbroken communication with a home base.]\r\n\r\n\r\nOn difficult ground, I would keep pushing on along the road.\r\n\r\n50. On hemmed-in ground, I would block any way of retreat.\r\n\r\n[Meng Shih says: \"To make it seem that I meant to defend the position,\r\nwhereas my real intention is to burst suddenly through the enemy’s\r\nlines.\" Mei Yao-ch’en says: \"in order to make my soldiers fight with\r\ndesperation.\" Wang Hsi says, \"fearing lest my men be tempted to run\r\naway.\" Tu Mu points out that this is the converse of VII. § 36, where\r\nit is the enemy who is surrounded. In 532 A.D., Kao Huan, afterwards\r\nEmperor and canonized as Shen-wu, was surrounded by a great army under\r\nErh-chu Chao and others. His own force was comparatively small,\r\nconsisting only of 2000 horse and something under 30,000 foot. The\r\nlines of investment had not been drawn very closely together, gaps\r\nbeing left at certain points. But Kao Huan, instead of trying to\r\nescape, actually made a shift to block all the remaining outlets\r\nhimself by driving into them a number of oxen and donkeys roped\r\ntogether. As soon as his officers and men saw that there was nothing\r\nfor it but to conquer or die, their spirits rose to an extraordinary\r\npitch of exaltation, and they charged with such desperate ferocity that\r\nthe opposing ranks broke and crumbled under their onslaught.]\r\n\r\n\r\nOn desperate ground, I would proclaim to my soldiers the hopelessness\r\nof saving their lives.\r\n\r\nTu Yu says: \"Burn your baggage and impedimenta, throw away your stores\r\nand provisions, choke up the wells, destroy your cooking-stoves, and\r\nmake it plain to your men that they cannot survive, but must fight to\r\nthe death.\" Mei Yao-ch’en says: \"The only chance of life lies in giving\r\nup all hope of it.\" This concludes what Sun Tzŭ has to say about\r\n\"grounds\" and the \"variations\" corresponding to them. Reviewing the\r\npassages which bear on this important subject, we cannot fail to be\r\nstruck by the desultory and unmethodical fashion in which it is\r\ntreated. Sun Tzŭ begins abruptly in VIII. § 2 to enumerate \"variations\"\r\nbefore touching on \"grounds\" at all, but only mentions five, namely\r\nnos. 7, 5, 8 and 9 of the subsequent list, and one that is not included\r\nin it. A few varieties of ground are dealt with in the earlier portion\r\nof chap. IX, and then chap. X sets forth six new grounds, with six\r\nvariations of plan to match. None of these is mentioned again, though\r\nthe first is hardly to be distinguished from ground no. 4 in the next\r\nchapter. At last, in chap. XI, we come to the Nine Grounds par\r\nexcellence, immediately followed by the variations. This takes us down\r\nto § 14. In §§ 43-45, fresh definitions are provided for nos. 5, 6, 2,\r\n8 and 9 (in the order given), as well as for the tenth ground noticed\r\nin chap. VIII; and finally, the nine variations are enumerated once\r\nmore from beginning to end, all, with the exception of 5, 6 and 7,\r\nbeing different from those previously given. Though it is impossible to\r\naccount for the present state of Sun Tzŭ’s text, a few suggestive facts\r\nmaybe brought into prominence: (1) Chap. VIII, according to the title,\r\nshould deal with nine variations, whereas only five appear. (2) It is\r\nan abnormally short chapter. (3) Chap. XI is entitled The Nine Grounds.\r\nSeveral of these are defined twice over, besides which there are two\r\ndistinct lists of the corresponding variations. (4) The length of the\r\nchapter is disproportionate, being double that of any other except IX.\r\nI do not propose to draw any inferences from these facts, beyond the\r\ngeneral conclusion that Sun Tzŭ’s work cannot have come down to us in\r\nthe shape in which it left his hands: chap. VIII is obviously defective\r\nand probably out of place, while XI seems to contain matter that has\r\neither been added by a later hand or ought to appear elsewhere.]\r\n\r\n\r\n51. For it is the soldier’s disposition to offer an obstinate\r\nresistance when surrounded, to fight hard when he cannot help himself,\r\nand to obey promptly when he has fallen into danger.\r\n\r\n[Chang Yu alludes to the conduct of Pan Ch’ao’s devoted followers in 73\r\nA.D. The story runs thus in the _Hou Han Shu_, ch. 47: \"When Pan Ch’ao\r\narrived at Shan-shan, Kuang, the King of the country, received him at\r\nfirst with great politeness and respect; but shortly afterwards his\r\nbehavior underwent a sudden change, and he became remiss and negligent.\r\nPan Ch’ao spoke about this to the officers of his suite: ‘Have you\r\nnoticed,’ he said, ‘that Kuang’s polite intentions are on the wane?\r\nThis must signify that envoys have come from the Northern barbarians,\r\nand that consequently he is in a state of indecision, not knowing with\r\nwhich side to throw in his lot. That surely is the reason. The truly\r\nwise man, we are told, can perceive things before they have come to\r\npass; how much more, then, those that are already manifest!’ Thereupon\r\nhe called one of the natives who had been assigned to his service, and\r\nset a trap for him, saying: ‘Where are those envoys from the Hsiung-nu\r\nwho arrived some day ago?’ The man was so taken aback that between\r\nsurprise and fear he presently blurted out the whole truth. Pan Ch’ao,\r\nkeeping his informant carefully under lock and key, then summoned a\r\ngeneral gathering of his officers, thirty-six in all, and began\r\ndrinking with them. When the wine had mounted into their heads a\r\nlittle, he tried to rouse their spirit still further by addressing them\r\nthus: ‘Gentlemen, here we are in the heart of an isolated region,\r\nanxious to achieve riches and honour by some great exploit. Now it\r\nhappens that an ambassador from the Hsiung-no arrived in this kingdom\r\nonly a few days ago, and the result is that the respectful courtesy\r\nextended towards us by our royal host has disappeared. Should this\r\nenvoy prevail upon him to seize our party and hand us over to the\r\nHsiung-no, our bones will become food for the wolves of the desert.\r\nWhat are we to do?’ With one accord, the officers replied: ‘Standing as\r\nwe do in peril of our lives, we will follow our commander through life\r\nand death.’ For the sequel of this adventure, see chap. XII. § 1,\r\nnote.]\r\n\r\n\r\n52. We cannot enter into alliance with neighbouring princes until we are\r\nacquainted with their designs. We are not fit to lead an army on the\r\nmarch unless we are familiar with the face of the country—its mountains\r\nand forests, its pitfalls and precipices, its marshes and swamps. We\r\nshall be unable to turn natural advantages to account unless we make\r\nuse of local guides.\r\n\r\n[These three sentences are repeated from VII. §§ 12-14—in order to\r\nemphasize their importance, the commentators seem to think. I prefer to\r\nregard them as interpolated here in order to form an antecedent to the\r\nfollowing words. With regard to local guides, Sun Tzŭ might have added\r\nthat there is always the risk of going wrong, either through their\r\ntreachery or some misunderstanding such as Livy records (XXII. 13):\r\nHannibal, we are told, ordered a guide to lead him into the\r\nneighbourhood of Casinum, where there was an important pass to be\r\noccupied; but his Carthaginian accent, unsuited to the pronunciation of\r\nLatin names, caused the guide to understand Casilinum instead of\r\nCasinum, and turning from his proper route, he took the army in that\r\ndirection, the mistake not being discovered until they had almost\r\narrived.]\r\n\r\n\r\n53. To be ignorant of any one of the following four or five principles\r\ndoes not befit a warlike prince.\r\n\r\n54. When a warlike prince attacks a powerful state, his generalship\r\nshows itself in preventing the concentration of the enemy’s forces. He\r\noverawes his opponents, and their allies are prevented from joining\r\nagainst him.\r\n\r\n[Mei Tao-ch’en constructs one of the chains of reasoning that are so\r\nmuch affected by the Chinese: \"In attacking a powerful state, if you\r\ncan divide her forces, you will have a superiority in strength; if you\r\nhave a superiority in strength, you will overawe the enemy; if you\r\noverawe the enemy, the neighbouring states will be frightened; and if\r\nthe neighbouring states are frightened, the enemy’s allies will be\r\nprevented from joining her.\" The following gives a stronger meaning:\r\n\"If the great state has once been defeated (before she has had time to\r\nsummon her allies), then the lesser states will hold aloof and refrain\r\nfrom massing their forces.\" Ch’en Hao and Chang Yu take the sentence in\r\nquite another way. The former says: \"Powerful though a prince may be,\r\nif he attacks a large state, he will be unable to raise enough troops,\r\nand must rely to some extent on external aid; if he dispenses with\r\nthis, and with overweening confidence in his own strength, simply tries\r\nto intimidate the enemy, he will surely be defeated.\" Chang Yu puts his\r\nview thus: \"If we recklessly attack a large state, our own people will\r\nbe discontented and hang back. But if (as will then be the case) our\r\ndisplay of military force is inferior by half to that of the enemy, the\r\nother chieftains will take fright and refuse to join us.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n55. Hence he does not strive to ally himself with all and sundry, nor\r\ndoes he foster the power of other states. He carries out his own secret\r\ndesigns, keeping his antagonists in awe.\r\n\r\n[The train of thought, as said by Li Ch’uan, appears to be this: Secure\r\nagainst a combination of his enemies, \"he can afford to reject\r\nentangling alliances and simply pursue his own secret designs, his\r\nprestige enable him to dispense with external friendships.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nThus he is able to capture their cities and overthrow their kingdoms.\r\n\r\n[This paragraph, though written many years before the Ch’in State\r\nbecame a serious menace, is not a bad summary of the policy by which\r\nthe famous Six Chancellors gradually paved the way for her final\r\ntriumph under Shih Huang Ti. Chang Yu, following up his previous note,\r\nthinks that Sun Tzŭ is condemning this attitude of cold-blooded\r\nselfishness and haughty isolation.]\r\n\r\n\r\n56. Bestow rewards without regard to rule,\r\n\r\n[Wu Tzŭ (ch. 3) less wisely says: \"Let advance be richly rewarded and\r\nretreat be heavily punished.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nissue orders\r\n\r\n[Literally, \"hang\" or post up.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nwithout regard to previous arrangements;\r\n\r\n[\"In order to prevent treachery,\" says Wang Hsi. The general meaning is\r\nmade clear by Ts’ao Kung’s quotation from the _Ssu-ma Fa:_ \"Give\r\ninstructions only on sighting the enemy; give rewards when you see\r\ndeserving deeds.\" Ts’ao Kung’s paraphrase: \"The final instructions you\r\ngive to your army should not correspond with those that have been\r\npreviously posted up.\" Chang Yu simplifies this into \"your arrangements\r\nshould not be divulged beforehand.\" And Chia Lin says: \"there should be\r\nno fixity in your rules and arrangements.\" Not only is there danger in\r\nletting your plans be known, but war often necessitates the entire\r\nreversal of them at the last moment.]\r\n\r\n\r\nand you will be able to handle a whole army as though you had to do\r\nwith but a single man.\r\n\r\n[Cf. _supra_, § 34.]\r\n\r\n\r\n57. Confront your soldiers with the deed itself; never let them know\r\nyour design.\r\n\r\n[Literally, \"do not tell them words;\" i.e. do not give your reasons for\r\nany order. Lord Mansfield once told a junior colleague to \"give no\r\nreasons\" for his decisions, and the maxim is even more applicable to a\r\ngeneral than to a judge.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the outlook is bright, bring it before their eyes; but tell them\r\nnothing when the situation is gloomy.\r\n\r\n58. Place your army in deadly peril, and it will survive; plunge it\r\ninto desperate straits, and it will come off in safety.\r\n\r\n[These words of Sun Tzŭ were once quoted by Han Hsin in explanation of\r\nthe tactics he employed in one of his most brilliant battles, already\r\nalluded to on p. 28. In 204 B.C., he was sent against the army of Chao,\r\nand halted ten miles from the mouth of the Ching-hsing pass, where the\r\nenemy had mustered in full force. Here, at midnight, he detached a body\r\nof 2000 light cavalry, every man of which was furnished with a red\r\nflag. Their instructions were to make their way through narrow defiles\r\nand keep a secret watch on the enemy. \"When the men of Chao see me in\r\nfull flight,\" Han Hsin said, \"they will abandon their fortifications\r\nand give chase. This must be the sign for you to rush in, pluck down\r\nthe Chao standards and set up the red banners of Han in their stead.\"\r\nTurning then to his other officers, he remarked: \"Our adversary holds a\r\nstrong position, and is not likely to come out and attack us until he\r\nsees the standard and drums of the commander-in-chief, for fear I\r\nshould turn back and escape through the mountains.\" So saying, he first\r\nof all sent out a division consisting of 10,000 men, and ordered them\r\nto form in line of battle with their backs to the River Ti. Seeing this\r\nmanœuver, the whole army of Chao broke into loud laughter. By this time\r\nit was broad daylight, and Han Hsin, displaying the generalissimo’s\r\nflag, marched out of the pass with drums beating, and was immediately\r\nengaged by the enemy. A great battle followed, lasting for some time;\r\nuntil at length Han Hsin and his colleague Chang Ni, leaving drums and\r\nbanner on the field, fled to the division on the river bank, where\r\nanother fierce battle was raging. The enemy rushed out to pursue them\r\nand to secure the trophies, thus denuding their ramparts of men; but\r\nthe two generals succeeded in joining the other army, which was\r\nfighting with the utmost desperation. The time had now come for the\r\n2000 horsemen to play their part. As soon as they saw the men of Chao\r\nfollowing up their advantage, they galloped behind the deserted walls,\r\ntore up the enemy’s flags and replaced them by those of Han. When the\r\nChao army looked back from the pursuit, the sight of these red flags\r\nstruck them with terror. Convinced that the Hans had got in and\r\noverpowered their king, they broke up in wild disorder, every effort of\r\ntheir leader to stay the panic being in vain. Then the Han army fell on\r\nthem from both sides and completed the rout, killing a number and\r\ncapturing the rest, amongst whom was King Ya himself…. After the\r\nbattle, some of Han Hsin’s officers came to him and said: \"In the _Art\r\nof War_ we are told to have a hill or tumulus on the right rear, and a\r\nriver or marsh on the left front. [This appears to be a blend of Sun\r\nTzŭ and T’ai Kung. See IX § 9, and note.] You, on the contrary, ordered\r\nus to draw up our troops with the river at our back. Under these\r\nconditions, how did you manage to gain the victory?\" The general\r\nreplied: \"I fear you gentlemen have not studied the Art of War with\r\nsufficient care. Is it not written there: ‘Plunge your army into\r\ndesperate straits and it will come off in safety; place it in deadly\r\nperil and it will survive’? Had I taken the usual course, I should\r\nnever have been able to bring my colleague round. What says the\r\nMilitary Classic—‘Swoop down on the market-place and drive the men off\r\nto fight.’ [This passage does not occur in the present text of Sun\r\nTzŭ.] If I had not placed my troops in a position where they were\r\nobliged to fight for their lives, but had allowed each man to follow\r\nhis own discretion, there would have been a general _débandade_, and it\r\nwould have been impossible to do anything with them.\" The officers\r\nadmitted the force of his argument, and said: \"These are higher tactics\r\nthan we should have been capable of.\" [See _Ch’ien Han Shu_, ch. 34,\r\nff. 4, 5.] ]\r\n\r\n\r\n59. For it is precisely when a force has fallen into harm’s way that is\r\ncapable of striking a blow for victory.\r\n\r\n[Danger has a bracing effect.]\r\n\r\n\r\n60. Success in warfare is gained by carefully accommodating ourselves\r\nto the enemy’s purpose.\r\n\r\n[Ts’ao Kung says: \"Feign stupidity\"—by an appearance of yielding and\r\nfalling in with the enemy’s wishes. Chang Yu’s note makes the meaning\r\nclear: \"If the enemy shows an inclination to advance, lure him on to do\r\nso; if he is anxious to retreat, delay on purpose that he may carry out\r\nhis intention.\" The object is to make him remiss and contemptuous\r\nbefore we deliver our attack.]\r\n\r\n\r\n61. By persistently hanging on the enemy’s flank,\r\n\r\n[I understand the first four words to mean \"accompanying the enemy in\r\none direction.\" Ts’ao Kung says: \"unite the soldiers and make for the\r\nenemy.\" But such a violent displacement of characters is quite\r\nindefensible.]\r\n\r\n\r\nwe shall succeed in the long run\r\n\r\n[Literally, \"after a thousand _li_.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nin killing the commander-in-chief.\r\n\r\n[Always a great point with the Chinese.]\r\n\r\n\r\n62. This is called ability to accomplish a thing by sheer cunning.\r\n\r\n63. On the day that you take up your command, block the frontier\r\npasses, destroy the official tallies,\r\n\r\n[These were tablets of bamboo or wood, one half of which was issued as\r\na permit or passport by the official in charge of a gate. Cf. the\r\n\"border-warden\" of _Lun Yu_ III. 24, who may have had similar duties.\r\nWhen this half was returned to him, within a fixed period, he was\r\nauthorized to open the gate and let the traveler through.]\r\n\r\n\r\nand stop the passage of all emissaries.\r\n\r\n[Either to or from the enemy’s country.]\r\n\r\n\r\n64. Be stern in the council-chamber,\r\n\r\n[Show no weakness, and insist on your plans being ratified by the\r\nsovereign.]\r\n\r\n\r\nso that you may control the situation.\r\n\r\n[Mei Yao-ch’en understands the whole sentence to mean: Take the\r\nstrictest precautions to ensure secrecy in your deliberations.]\r\n\r\n\r\n65. If the enemy leaves a door open, you must rush in.\r\n\r\n66. Forestall your opponent by seizing what he holds dear,\r\n\r\n[Cf. _supra_, § 18.]\r\n\r\n\r\nand subtly contrive to time his arrival on the ground.\r\n\r\n[Ch’en Hao’s explanation: \"If I manage to seize a favourable position,\r\nbut the enemy does not appear on the scene, the advantage thus obtained\r\ncannot be turned to any practical account. He who intends therefore, to\r\noccupy a position of importance to the enemy, must begin by making an\r\nartful appointment, so to speak, with his antagonist, and cajole him\r\ninto going there as well.\" Mei Yao-ch’en explains that this \"artful\r\nappointment\" is to be made through the medium of the enemy’s own spies,\r\nwho will carry back just the amount of information that we choose to\r\ngive them. Then, having cunningly disclosed our intentions, \"we must\r\nmanage, though starting after the enemy, to arrive before him (VII. §\r\n4). We must start after him in order to ensure his marching thither; we\r\nmust arrive before him in order to capture the place without trouble.\r\nTaken thus, the present passage lends some support to Mei Yao-ch’en’s\r\ninterpretation of § 47.]\r\n\r\n\r\n67. Walk in the path defined by rule,\r\n\r\n[Chia Lin says: \"Victory is the only thing that matters, and this\r\ncannot be achieved by adhering to conventional canons.\" It is\r\nunfortunate that this variant rests on very slight authority, for the\r\nsense yielded is certainly much more satisfactory. Napoleon, as we\r\nknow, according to the veterans of the old school whom he defeated, won\r\nhis battles by violating every accepted canon of warfare.]\r\n\r\n\r\nand accommodate yourself to the enemy until you can fight a decisive\r\nbattle.\r\n\r\n[Tu Mu says: \"Conform to the enemy’s tactics until a favourable\r\nopportunity offers; then come forth and engage in a battle that shall\r\nprove decisive.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n68. At first, then, exhibit the coyness of a maiden, until the enemy\r\ngives you an opening; afterwards emulate the rapidity of a running\r\nhare, and it will be too late for the enemy to oppose you.\r\n\r\n[As the hare is noted for its extreme timidity, the comparison hardly\r\nappears felicitous. But of course Sun Tzŭ was thinking only of its\r\nspeed. The words have been taken to mean: You must flee from the enemy\r\nas quickly as an escaping hare; but this is rightly rejected by Tu Mu.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Giles’ Biographical Dictionary, no. 399.\r\n\r\n[2] \"The Science of War,\" p. 333.\r\n\r\n[3] \"Stonewall Jackson,\" vol. I, p. 421.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XII. THE ATTACK BY FIRE\r\n\r\n[Rather more than half the chapter (§§ 1-13) is devoted to the subject\r\nof fire, after which the author branches off into other topics.]\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Sun Tzŭ said: There are five ways of attacking with fire. The first\r\nis to burn soldiers in their camp;\r\n\r\n[So Tu Mu. Li Ch’uan says: \"Set fire to the camp, and kill the\r\nsoldiers\" (when they try to escape from the flames). Pan Ch’ao, sent on\r\na diplomatic mission to the King of Shan-shan [see XI. § 51, note],\r\nfound himself placed in extreme peril by the unexpected arrival of an\r\nenvoy from the Hsiung-nu [the mortal enemies of the Chinese]. In\r\nconsultation with his officers, he exclaimed: \"Never venture, never\r\nwin! [1] The only course open to us now is to make an assault by fire\r\non the barbarians under cover of night, when they will not be able to\r\ndiscern our numbers. Profiting by their panic, we shall exterminate\r\nthem completely; this will cool the King’s courage and cover us with\r\nglory, besides ensuring the success of our mission.’ The officers all\r\nreplied that it would be necessary to discuss the matter first with the\r\nIntendant. Pan Ch’ao then fell into a passion: ‘It is today,’ he cried,\r\n‘that our fortunes must be decided! The Intendant is only a humdrum\r\ncivilian, who on hearing of our project will certainly be afraid, and\r\neverything will be brought to light. An inglorious death is no worthy\r\nfate for valiant warriors.’ All then agreed to do as he wished.\r\nAccordingly, as soon as night came on, he and his little band quickly\r\nmade their way to the barbarian camp. A strong gale was blowing at the\r\ntime. Pan Ch’ao ordered ten of the party to take drums and hide behind\r\nthe enemy’s barracks, it being arranged that when they saw flames shoot\r\nup, they should begin drumming and yelling with all their might. The\r\nrest of his men, armed with bows and crossbows, he posted in ambuscade\r\nat the gate of the camp. He then set fire to the place from the\r\nwindward side, whereupon a deafening noise of drums and shouting arose\r\non the front and rear of the Hsiung-nu, who rushed out pell-mell in\r\nfrantic disorder. Pan Ch’ao slew three of them with his own hand, while\r\nhis companions cut off the heads of the envoy and thirty of his suite.\r\nThe remainder, more than a hundred in all, perished in the flames. On\r\nthe following day, Pan Ch’ao, divining his thoughts, said with uplifted\r\nhand: ‘Although you did not go with us last night, I should not think,\r\nSir, of taking sole credit for our exploit.’ This satisfied Kuo Hsun,\r\nand Pan Ch’ao, having sent for Kuang, King of Shan-shan, showed him the\r\nhead of the barbarian envoy. The whole kingdom was seized with fear and\r\ntrembling, which Pan Ch’ao took steps to allay by issuing a public\r\nproclamation. Then, taking the king’s sons as hostage, he returned to\r\nmake his report to Tou Ku.\" _Hou Han Shu_, ch. 47, ff. 1, 2.] ]\r\n\r\n\r\nthe second is to burn stores;\r\n\r\n[Tu Mu says: \"Provisions, fuel and fodder.\" In order to subdue the\r\nrebellious population of Kiangnan, Kao Keng recommended Wen Ti of the\r\nSui dynasty to make periodical raids and burn their stores of grain, a\r\npolicy which in the long run proved entirely successful.]\r\n\r\n\r\nthe third is to burn baggage-trains;\r\n\r\n[An example given is the destruction of Yuan Shao’s wagons and\r\nimpedimenta by Ts’ao Ts’ao in 200 A.D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nthe fourth is to burn arsenals and magazines;\r\n\r\n[Tu Mu says that the things contained in \"arsenals\" and \"magazines\" are\r\nthe same. He specifies weapons and other implements, bullion and\r\nclothing. Cf. VII. § 11.]\r\n\r\n\r\nthe fifth is to hurl dropping fire amongst the enemy.\r\n\r\n[Tu Yu says in the _T’ung Tien:_ \"To drop fire into the enemy’s camp.\r\nThe method by which this may be done is to set the tips of arrows\r\nalight by dipping them into a brazier, and then shoot them from\r\npowerful crossbows into the enemy’s lines.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n2. In order to carry out an attack, we must have means available.\r\n\r\n[T’sao Kung thinks that \"traitors in the enemy’s camp\" are referred to.\r\nBut Ch’en Hao is more likely to be right in saying: \"We must have\r\nfavourable circumstances in general, not merely traitors to help us.\"\r\nChia Lin says: \"We must avail ourselves of wind and dry weather.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nthe material for raising fire should always be kept in readiness.\r\n\r\n[Tu Mu suggests as material for making fire: \"dry vegetable matter,\r\nreeds, brushwood, straw, grease, oil, etc.\" Here we have the material\r\ncause. Chang Yu says: \"vessels for hoarding fire, stuff for lighting\r\nfires.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n3. There is a proper season for making attacks with fire, and special\r\ndays for starting a conflagration.\r\n\r\n4. The proper season is when the weather is very dry; the special days\r\nare those when the moon is in the constellations of the Sieve, the\r\nWall, the Wing or the Cross-bar;\r\n\r\n[These are, respectively, the 7th, 14th, 27th, and 28th of the\r\nTwenty-eight Stellar Mansions, corresponding roughly to Sagittarius,\r\nPegasus, Crater and Corvus.]\r\n\r\n\r\nfor these four are all days of rising wind.\r\n\r\n5. In attacking with fire, one should be prepared to meet five possible\r\ndevelopments:\r\n\r\n6. (1) When fire breaks out inside the enemy’s camp, respond at once\r\nwith an attack from without.\r\n\r\n7. (2) If there is an outbreak of fire, but the enemy’s soldiers remain\r\nquiet, bide your time and do not attack.\r\n\r\n[The prime object of attacking with fire is to throw the enemy into\r\nconfusion. If this effect is not produced, it means that the enemy is\r\nready to receive us. Hence the necessity for caution.]\r\n\r\n\r\n8. (3) When the force of the flames has reached its height, follow it\r\nup with an attack, if that is practicable; if not, stay where you are.\r\n\r\n[Ts’ao Kung says: \"If you see a possible way, advance; but if you find\r\nthe difficulties too great, retire.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n9. (4) If it is possible to make an assault with fire from without, do\r\nnot wait for it to break out within, but deliver your attack at a\r\nfavourable moment.\r\n\r\n[Tu Mu says that the previous paragraphs had reference to the fire\r\nbreaking out (either accidentally, we may suppose, or by the agency of\r\nincendiaries) inside the enemy’s camp. \"But,\" he continues, \"if the\r\nenemy is settled in a waste place littered with quantities of grass, or\r\nif he has pitched his camp in a position which can be burnt out, we\r\nmust carry our fire against him at any seasonable opportunity, and not\r\nawait on in hopes of an outbreak occurring within, for fear our\r\nopponents should themselves burn up the surrounding vegetation, and\r\nthus render our own attempts fruitless.\" The famous Li Ling once\r\nbaffled the leader of the Hsiung-nu in this way. The latter, taking\r\nadvantage of a favourable wind, tried to set fire to the Chinese\r\ngeneral’s camp, but found that every scrap of combustible vegetation in\r\nthe neighbourhood had already been burnt down. On the other hand,\r\nPo-ts’ai, a general of the Yellow Turban rebels, was badly defeated in\r\n184 A.D. through his neglect of this simple precaution. \"At the head of\r\na large army he was besieging Ch’ang-she, which was held by Huang-fu\r\nSung. The garrison was very small, and a general feeling of nervousness\r\npervaded the ranks; so Huang-fu Sung called his officers together and\r\nsaid: \"In war, there are various indirect methods of attack, and\r\nnumbers do not count for everything. [The commentator here quotes Sun\r\nTzŭ, V. §§ 5, 6 and 10.] Now the rebels have pitched their camp in the\r\nmidst of thick grass which will easily burn when the wind blows. If we\r\nset fire to it at night, they will be thrown into a panic, and we can\r\nmake a sortie and attack them on all sides at once, thus emulating the\r\nachievement of T’ien Tan.’ [See p. 90.] That same evening, a strong\r\nbreeze sprang up; so Huang-fu Sung instructed his soldiers to bind\r\nreeds together into torches and mount guard on the city walls, after\r\nwhich he sent out a band of daring men, who stealthily made their way\r\nthrough the lines and started the fire with loud shouts and yells.\r\nSimultaneously, a glare of light shot up from the city walls, and\r\nHuang-fu Sung, sounding his drums, led a rapid charge, which threw the\r\nrebels into confusion and put them to headlong flight.\" [_Hou Han Shu_,\r\nch. 71.]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n10. (5) When you start a fire, be to windward of it. Do not attack from\r\nthe leeward.\r\n\r\n[Chang Yu, following Tu Yu, says: \"When you make a fire, the enemy will\r\nretreat away from it; if you oppose his retreat and attack him then, he\r\nwill fight desperately, which will not conduce to your success.\" A\r\nrather more obvious explanation is given by Tu Mu: \"If the wind is in\r\nthe east, begin burning to the east of the enemy, and follow up the\r\nattack yourself from that side. If you start the fire on the east side,\r\nand then attack from the west, you will suffer in the same way as your\r\nenemy.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n11. A wind that rises in the daytime lasts long, but a night breeze\r\nsoon falls.\r\n\r\n[Cf. Lao Tzŭ’s saying: \"A violent wind does not last the space of a\r\nmorning.\" (_Tao Te Ching_, chap. 23.) Mei Yao-ch’en and Wang Hsi say:\r\n\"A day breeze dies down at nightfall, and a night breeze at daybreak.\r\nThis is what happens as a general rule.\" The phenomenon observed may be\r\ncorrect enough, but how this sense is to be obtained is not apparent.]\r\n\r\n\r\n12. In every army, the five developments connected with fire must be\r\nknown, the movements of the stars calculated, and a watch kept for the\r\nproper days.\r\n\r\n[Tu Mu says: \"We must make calculations as to the paths of the stars,\r\nand watch for the days on which wind will rise, before making our\r\nattack with fire.\" Chang Yu seems to interpret the text differently:\r\n\"We must not only know how to assail our opponents with fire, but also\r\nbe on our guard against similar attacks from them.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n13. Hence those who use fire as an aid to the attack show intelligence;\r\nthose who use water as an aid to the attack gain an accession of\r\nstrength.\r\n\r\n14. By means of water, an enemy may be intercepted, but not robbed of\r\nall his belongings.\r\n\r\n[Ts’ao Kung’s note is: \"We can merely obstruct the enemy’s road or\r\ndivide his army, but not sweep away all his accumulated stores.\" Water\r\ncan do useful service, but it lacks the terrible destructive power of\r\nfire. This is the reason, Chang Yu concludes, why the former is\r\ndismissed in a couple of sentences, whereas the attack by fire is\r\ndiscussed in detail. Wu Tzŭ (ch. 4) speaks thus of the two elements:\r\n\"If an army is encamped on low-lying marshy ground, from which the\r\nwater cannot run off, and where the rainfall is heavy, it may be\r\nsubmerged by a flood. If an army is encamped in wild marsh lands\r\nthickly overgrown with weeds and brambles, and visited by frequent\r\ngales, it may be exterminated by fire.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n15. Unhappy is the fate of one who tries to win his battles and succeed\r\nin his attacks without cultivating the spirit of enterprise; for the\r\nresult is waste of time and general stagnation.\r\n\r\n[This is one of the most perplexing passages in Sun Tzŭ. Ts’ao Kung\r\nsays: \"Rewards for good service should not be deferred a single day.\"\r\nAnd Tu Mu: \"If you do not take opportunity to advance and reward the\r\ndeserving, your subordinates will not carry out your commands, and\r\ndisaster will ensue.\" For several reasons, however, and in spite of the\r\nformidable array of scholars on the other side, I prefer the\r\ninterpretation suggested by Mei Yao-ch’en alone, whose words I will\r\nquote: \"Those who want to make sure of succeeding in their battles and\r\nassaults must seize the favourable moments when they come and not shrink\r\non occasion from heroic measures: that is to say, they must resort to\r\nsuch means of attack of fire, water and the like. What they must not\r\ndo, and what will prove fatal, is to sit still and simply hold to the\r\nadvantages they have got.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n16. Hence the saying: The enlightened ruler lays his plans well ahead;\r\nthe good general cultivates his resources.\r\n\r\n[Tu Mu quotes the following from the _San Lueh_, ch. 2: \"The warlike\r\nprince controls his soldiers by his authority, kits them together by\r\ngood faith, and by rewards makes them serviceable. If faith decays,\r\nthere will be disruption; if rewards are deficient, commands will not\r\nbe respected.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n17. Move not unless you see an advantage; use not your troops unless\r\nthere is something to be gained; fight not unless the position is\r\ncritical.\r\n\r\n[Sun Tzŭ may at times appear to be over-cautious, but he never goes so\r\nfar in that direction as the remarkable passage in the _Tao Te Ching_,\r\nch. 69. \"I dare not take the initiative, but prefer to act on the\r\ndefensive; I dare not advance an inch, but prefer to retreat a foot.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n18. No ruler should put troops into the field merely to gratify his own\r\nspleen; no general should fight a battle simply out of pique.\r\n\r\n19. If it is to your advantage, make a forward move; if not, stay where\r\nyou are.\r\n\r\n[This is repeated from XI. § 17. Here I feel convinced that it is an\r\ninterpolation, for it is evident that § 20 ought to follow immediately\r\non § 18.]\r\n\r\n\r\n20. Anger may in time change to gladness; vexation may be succeeded by\r\ncontent.\r\n\r\n21. But a kingdom that has once been destroyed can never come again\r\ninto being;\r\n\r\n[The Wu State was destined to be a melancholy example of this saying.]\r\n\r\n\r\nnor can the dead ever be brought back to life.\r\n\r\n22. Hence the enlightened ruler is heedful, and the good general full\r\nof caution. This is the way to keep a country at peace and an army\r\nintact.\r\n\r\n[1] \"Unless you enter the tiger’s lair, you cannot get hold of the\r\ntiger’s cubs.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XIII. THE USE OF SPIES\r\n\r\n1. Sun Tzŭ said: Raising a host of a hundred thousand men and marching\r\nthem great distances entails heavy loss on the people and a drain on\r\nthe resources of the State. The daily expenditure will amount to a\r\nthousand ounces of silver.\r\n\r\n[Cf. II. §§ 1, 13, 14.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThere will be commotion at home and abroad, and men will drop down\r\nexhausted on the highways.\r\n\r\n[Cf. _Tao Te Ching_, ch. 30: \"Where troops have been quartered,\r\nbrambles and thorns spring up. Chang Yu has the note: \"We may be\r\nreminded of the saying: ‘On serious ground, gather in plunder.’ Why\r\nthen should carriage and transportation cause exhaustion on the\r\nhighways?—The answer is, that not victuals alone, but all sorts of\r\nmunitions of war have to be conveyed to the army. Besides, the\r\ninjunction to ‘forage on the enemy’ only means that when an army is\r\ndeeply engaged in hostile territory, scarcity of food must be provided\r\nagainst. Hence, without being solely dependent on the enemy for corn,\r\nwe must forage in order that there may be an uninterrupted flow of\r\nsupplies. Then, again, there are places like salt deserts where\r\nprovisions being unobtainable, supplies from home cannot be dispensed\r\nwith.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nAs many as seven hundred thousand families will be impeded in their\r\nlabor.\r\n\r\n[Mei Yao-ch’en says: \"Men will be lacking at the plough-tail.\" The\r\nallusion is to the system of dividing land into nine parts, each\r\nconsisting of about 15 acres, the plot in the center being cultivated\r\non behalf of the State by the tenants of the other eight. It was here\r\nalso, so Tu Mu tells us, that their cottages were built and a well\r\nsunk, to be used by all in common. [See II. § 12, note.] In time of\r\nwar, one of the families had to serve in the army, while the other\r\nseven contributed to its support. Thus, by a levy of 100,000 men\r\n(reckoning one able-bodied soldier to each family) the husbandry of\r\n700,000 families would be affected.]\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Hostile armies may face each other for years, striving for the\r\nvictory which is decided in a single day. This being so, to remain in\r\nignorance of the enemy’s condition simply because one grudges the\r\noutlay of a hundred ounces of silver in honours and emoluments,\r\n\r\n[\"For spies\" is of course the meaning, though it would spoil the effect\r\nof this curiously elaborate exordium if spies were actually mentioned\r\nat this point.]\r\n\r\n\r\nis the height of inhumanity.\r\n\r\n[Sun Tzŭ’s agreement is certainly ingenious. He begins by adverting to\r\nthe frightful misery and vast expenditure of blood and treasure which\r\nwar always brings in its train. Now, unless you are kept informed of\r\nthe enemy’s condition, and are ready to strike at the right moment, a\r\nwar may drag on for years. The only way to get this information is to\r\nemploy spies, and it is impossible to obtain trustworthy spies unless\r\nthey are properly paid for their services. But it is surely false\r\neconomy to grudge a comparatively trifling amount for this purpose,\r\nwhen every day that the war lasts eats up an incalculably greater sum.\r\nThis grievous burden falls on the shoulders of the poor, and hence Sun\r\nTzŭ concludes that to neglect the use of spies is nothing less than a\r\ncrime against humanity.]\r\n\r\n\r\n3. One who acts thus is no leader of men, no present help to his\r\nsovereign, no master of victory.\r\n\r\n[This idea, that the true object of war is peace, has its root in the\r\nnational temperament of the Chinese. Even so far back as 597 B.C.,\r\nthese memorable words were uttered by Prince Chuang of the Ch’u State:\r\n\"The [Chinese] character for ‘prowess’ is made up of [the characters\r\nfor] ‘to stay’ and ‘a spear’ (cessation of hostilities). Military\r\nprowess is seen in the repression of cruelty, the calling in of\r\nweapons, the preservation of the appointment of Heaven, the firm\r\nestablishment of merit, the bestowal of happiness on the people,\r\nputting harmony between the princes, the diffusion of wealth.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Thus, what enables the wise sovereign and the good general to strike\r\nand conquer, and achieve things beyond the reach of ordinary men, is\r\n_foreknowledge_.\r\n\r\n[That is, knowledge of the enemy’s dispositions, and what he means to\r\ndo.]\r\n\r\n\r\n5. Now this foreknowledge cannot be elicited from spirits; it cannot be\r\nobtained inductively from experience,\r\n\r\n[Tu Mu’s note is: \"[knowledge of the enemy] cannot be gained by\r\nreasoning from other analogous cases.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nnor by any deductive calculation.\r\n\r\n[Li Ch’uan says: \"Quantities like length, breadth, distance and\r\nmagnitude, are susceptible of exact mathematical determination; human\r\nactions cannot be so calculated.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n6. Knowledge of the enemy’s dispositions can only be obtained from\r\nother men.\r\n\r\n[Mei Yao-ch’en has rather an interesting note: \"Knowledge of the\r\nspirit-world is to be obtained by divination; information in natural\r\nscience may be sought by inductive reasoning; the laws of the universe\r\ncan be verified by mathematical calculation: but the dispositions of an\r\nenemy are ascertainable through spies and spies alone.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n7. Hence the use of spies, of whom there are five classes: (1) Local\r\nspies; (2) inward spies; (3) converted spies; (4) doomed spies; (5)\r\nsurviving spies.\r\n\r\n8. When these five kinds of spy are all at work, none can discover the\r\nsecret system. This is called \"divine manipulation of the threads.\" It\r\nis the sovereign’s most precious faculty.\r\n\r\n[Cromwell, one of the greatest and most practical of all cavalry\r\nleaders, had officers styled ‘scout masters,’ whose business it was to\r\ncollect all possible information regarding the enemy, through scouts\r\nand spies, etc., and much of his success in war was traceable to the\r\nprevious knowledge of the enemy’s moves thus gained.\" [1] ]\r\n\r\n\r\n9. Having _local spies_ means employing the services of the inhabitants\r\nof a district.\r\n\r\n[Tu Mu says: \"In the enemy’s country, win people over by kind\r\ntreatment, and use them as spies.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n10. Having _inward spies_, making use of officials of the enemy.\r\n\r\n[Tu Mu enumerates the following classes as likely to do good service in\r\nthis respect: \"Worthy men who have been degraded from office, criminals\r\nwho have undergone punishment; also, favourite concubines who are greedy\r\nfor gold, men who are aggrieved at being in subordinate positions, or\r\nwho have been passed over in the distribution of posts, others who are\r\nanxious that their side should be defeated in order that they may have\r\na chance of displaying their ability and talents, fickle turncoats who\r\nalways want to have a foot in each boat. Officials of these several\r\nkinds,\" he continues, \"should be secretly approached and bound to one’s\r\ninterests by means of rich presents. In this way you will be able to\r\nfind out the state of affairs in the enemy’s country, ascertain the\r\nplans that are being formed against you, and moreover disturb the\r\nharmony and create a breach between the sovereign and his ministers.\"\r\nThe necessity for extreme caution, however, in dealing with \"inward\r\nspies,\" appears from an historical incident related by Ho Shih: \"Lo\r\nShang, Governor of I-Chou, sent his general Wei Po to attack the rebel\r\nLi Hsiung of Shu in his stronghold at P’i. After each side had\r\nexperienced a number of victories and defeats, Li Hsiung had recourse\r\nto the services of a certain P’o-t’ai, a native of Wu-tu. He began to\r\nhave him whipped until the blood came, and then sent him off to Lo\r\nShang, whom he was to delude by offering to cooperate with him from\r\ninside the city, and to give a fire signal at the right moment for\r\nmaking a general assault. Lo Shang, confiding in these promises, march\r\nout all his best troops, and placed Wei Po and others at their head\r\nwith orders to attack at P’o-t’ai’s bidding. Meanwhile, Li Hsiung’s\r\ngeneral, Li Hsiang, had prepared an ambuscade on their line of march;\r\nand P’o-t’ai, having reared long scaling-ladders against the city\r\nwalls, now lighted the beacon-fire. Wei Po’s men raced up on seeing the\r\nsignal and began climbing the ladders as fast as they could, while\r\nothers were drawn up by ropes lowered from above. More than a hundred\r\nof Lo Shang’s soldiers entered the city in this way, every one of whom\r\nwas forthwith beheaded. Li Hsiung then charged with all his forces,\r\nboth inside and outside the city, and routed the enemy completely.\"\r\n[This happened in 303 A.D. I do not know where Ho Shih got the story\r\nfrom. It is not given in the biography of Li Hsiung or that of his\r\nfather Li T’e, _Chin Shu_, ch. 120, 121.]\r\n\r\n\r\n11. Having _converted spies_, getting hold of the enemy’s spies and\r\nusing them for our own purposes.\r\n\r\n[By means of heavy bribes and liberal promises detaching them from the\r\nenemy’s service, and inducing them to carry back false information as\r\nwell as to spy in turn on their own countrymen. On the other hand,\r\nHsiao Shih-hsien says that we pretend not to have detected him, but\r\ncontrive to let him carry away a false impression of what is going on.\r\nSeveral of the commentators accept this as an alternative definition;\r\nbut that it is not what Sun Tzŭ meant is conclusively proved by his\r\nsubsequent remarks about treating the converted spy generously (§ 21\r\nsqq.). Ho Shih notes three occasions on which converted spies were used\r\nwith conspicuous success: (1) by T’ien Tan in his defence of Chi-mo\r\n(see _supra_, p. 90); (2) by Chao She on his march to O-yu (see p. 57);\r\nand by the wily Fan Chu in 260 B.C., when Lien P’o was conducting a\r\ndefensive campaign against Ch’in. The King of Chao strongly disapproved\r\nof Lien P’o’s cautious and dilatory methods, which had been unable to\r\navert a series of minor disasters, and therefore lent a ready ear to\r\nthe reports of his spies, who had secretly gone over to the enemy and\r\nwere already in Fan Chu’s pay. They said: \"The only thing which causes\r\nCh’in anxiety is lest Chao Kua should be made general. Lien P’o they\r\nconsider an easy opponent, who is sure to be vanquished in the long\r\nrun.\" Now this Chao Kua was a son of the famous Chao She. From his\r\nboyhood, he had been wholly engrossed in the study of war and military\r\nmatters, until at last he came to believe that there was no commander\r\nin the whole Empire who could stand against him. His father was much\r\ndisquieted by this overweening conceit, and the flippancy with which he\r\nspoke of such a serious thing as war, and solemnly declared that if\r\never Kua was appointed general, he would bring ruin on the armies of\r\nChao. This was the man who, in spite of earnest protests from his own\r\nmother and the veteran statesman Lin Hsiang-ju, was now sent to succeed\r\nLien P’o. Needless to say, he proved no match for the redoubtable Po\r\nCh’i and the great military power of Ch’in. He fell into a trap by\r\nwhich his army was divided into two and his communications cut; and\r\nafter a desperate resistance lasting 46 days, during which the famished\r\nsoldiers devoured one another, he was himself killed by an arrow, and\r\nhis whole force, amounting, it is said, to 400,000 men, ruthlessly put\r\nto the sword.]\r\n\r\n\r\n12. Having _doomed spies_, doing certain things openly for purposes of\r\ndeception, and allowing our own spies to know of them and report them\r\nto the enemy.\r\n\r\n[Tu Yu gives the best exposition of the meaning: \"We ostentatiously do\r\nthings calculated to deceive our own spies, who must be led to believe\r\nthat they have been unwittingly disclosed. Then, when these spies are\r\ncaptured in the enemy’s lines, they will make an entirely false report,\r\nand the enemy will take measures accordingly, only to find that we do\r\nsomething quite different. The spies will thereupon be put to death.\"\r\nAs an example of doomed spies, Ho Shih mentions the prisoners released\r\nby Pan Ch’ao in his campaign against Yarkand. (See p. 132.) He also\r\nrefers to T’ang Chien, who in 630 A.D. was sent by T’ai Tsung to lull\r\nthe Turkish Kahn Chieh-li into fancied security, until Li Ching was\r\nable to deliver a crushing blow against him. Chang Yu says that the\r\nTurks revenged themselves by killing T’ang Chien, but this is a\r\nmistake, for we read in both the old and the New T’ang History (ch. 58,\r\nfol. 2 and ch. 89, fol. 8 respectively) that he escaped and lived on\r\nuntil 656. Li I-chi played a somewhat similar part in 203 B.C., when\r\nsent by the King of Han to open peaceful negotiations with Ch’i. He has\r\ncertainly more claim to be described a \"doomed spy\", for the king of\r\nCh’i, being subsequently attacked without warning by Han Hsin, and\r\ninfuriated by what he considered the treachery of Li I-chi, ordered the\r\nunfortunate envoy to be boiled alive.]\r\n\r\n\r\n13. _Surviving spies_, finally, are those who bring back news from the\r\nenemy’s camp.\r\n\r\n[This is the ordinary class of spies, properly so called, forming a\r\nregular part of the army. Tu Mu says: \"Your surviving spy must be a man\r\nof keen intellect, though in outward appearance a fool; of shabby\r\nexterior, but with a will of iron. He must be active, robust, endowed\r\nwith physical strength and courage; thoroughly accustomed to all sorts\r\nof dirty work, able to endure hunger and cold, and to put up with shame\r\nand ignominy.\" Ho Shih tells the following story of Ta’hsi Wu of the\r\nSui dynasty: \"When he was governor of Eastern Ch’in, Shen-wu of Ch’i\r\nmade a hostile movement upon Sha-yuan. The Emperor T’ai Tsu [? Kao Tsu]\r\nsent Ta-hsi Wu to spy upon the enemy. He was accompanied by two other\r\nmen. All three were on horseback and wore the enemy’s uniform. When it\r\nwas dark, they dismounted a few hundred feet away from the enemy’s camp\r\nand stealthily crept up to listen, until they succeeded in catching the\r\npasswords used in the army. Then they got on their horses again and\r\nboldly passed through the camp under the guise of night-watchmen; and\r\nmore than once, happening to come across a soldier who was committing\r\nsome breach of discipline, they actually stopped to give the culprit a\r\nsound cudgeling! Thus they managed to return with the fullest possible\r\ninformation about the enemy’s dispositions, and received warm\r\ncommendation from the Emperor, who in consequence of their report was\r\nable to inflict a severe defeat on his adversary.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n14. Hence it is that with none in the whole army are more intimate\r\nrelations to be maintained than with spies.\r\n\r\n[Tu Mu and Mei Yao-ch’en point out that the spy is privileged to enter\r\neven the general’s private sleeping-tent.]\r\n\r\n\r\nNone should be more liberally rewarded. In no other business should\r\ngreater secrecy be preserved.\r\n\r\n[Tu Mu gives a graphic touch: all communication with spies should be\r\ncarried \"mouth-to-ear.\" The following remarks on spies may be quoted\r\nfrom Turenne, who made perhaps larger use of them than any previous\r\ncommander: \"Spies are attached to those who give them most, he who pays\r\nthem ill is never served. They should never be known to anybody; nor\r\nshould they know one another. When they propose anything very material,\r\nsecure their persons, or have in your possession their wives and\r\nchildren as hostages for their fidelity. Never communicate anything to\r\nthem but what is absolutely necessary that they should know. [2] ]\r\n\r\n\r\n15. Spies cannot be usefully employed without a certain intuitive\r\nsagacity.\r\n\r\n[Mei Yao-ch’en says: \"In order to use them, one must know fact from\r\nfalsehood, and be able to discriminate between honesty and\r\ndouble-dealing.\" Wang Hsi in a different interpretation thinks more\r\nalong the lines of \"intuitive perception\" and \"practical intelligence.\"\r\nTu Mu strangely refers these attributes to the spies themselves:\r\n\"Before using spies we must assure ourselves as to their integrity of\r\ncharacter and the extent of their experience and skill.\" But he\r\ncontinues: \"A brazen face and a crafty disposition are more dangerous\r\nthan mountains or rivers; it takes a man of genius to penetrate such.\"\r\nSo that we are left in some doubt as to his real opinion on the\r\npassage.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n16. They cannot be properly managed without benevolence and\r\nstraightforwardness.\r\n\r\n[Chang Yu says: \"When you have attracted them by substantial offers,\r\nyou must treat them with absolute sincerity; then they will work for\r\nyou with all their might.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n17. Without subtle ingenuity of mind, one cannot make certain of the\r\ntruth of their reports.\r\n\r\n[Mei Yao-ch’en says: \"Be on your guard against the possibility of spies\r\ngoing over to the service of the enemy.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n18. Be subtle! be subtle! and use your spies for every kind of\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\n[Cf. VI. § 9.]\r\n\r\n\r\n19. If a secret piece of news is divulged by a spy before the time is\r\nripe, he must be put to death together with the man to whom the secret\r\nwas told.\r\n\r\n[Word for word, the translation here is: \"If spy matters are heard\r\nbefore [our plans] are carried out,\" etc. Sun Tzŭ’s main point in this\r\npassage is: Whereas you kill the spy himself \"as a punishment for\r\nletting out the secret,\" the object of killing the other man is only,\r\nas Ch’en Hao puts it, \"to stop his mouth\" and prevent news leaking any\r\nfurther. If it had already been repeated to others, this object would\r\nnot be gained. Either way, Sun Tzŭ lays himself open to the charge of\r\ninhumanity, though Tu Mu tries to defend him by saying that the man\r\ndeserves to be put to death, for the spy would certainly not have told\r\nthe secret unless the other had been at pains to worm it out of him.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n20. Whether the object be to crush an army, to storm a city, or to\r\nassassinate an individual, it is always necessary to begin by finding\r\nout the names of the attendants, the aides-de- camp,\r\n\r\n[Literally \"visitors\", is equivalent, as Tu Yu says, to \"those whose\r\nduty it is to keep the general supplied with information,\" which\r\nnaturally necessitates frequent interviews with him.]\r\n\r\n\r\nthe door-keepers and sentries of the general in command. Our spies must\r\nbe commissioned to ascertain these.\r\n\r\n[As the first step, no doubt towards finding out if any of these\r\nimportant functionaries can be won over by bribery.]\r\n\r\n\r\n21. The enemy’s spies who have come to spy on us must be sought out,\r\ntempted with bribes, led away and comfortably housed. Thus they will\r\nbecome converted spies and available for our service.\r\n\r\n22. It is through the information brought by the converted spy that we\r\nare able to acquire and employ local and inward spies.\r\n\r\n[Tu Yu says: \"through conversion of the enemy’s spies we learn the\r\nenemy’s condition.\" And Chang Yu says: \"We must tempt the converted spy\r\ninto our service, because it is he that knows which of the local\r\ninhabitants are greedy of gain, and which of the officials are open to\r\ncorruption.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n23. It is owing to his information, again, that we can cause the doomed\r\nspy to carry false tidings to the enemy.\r\n\r\n[Chang Yu says, \"because the converted spy knows how the enemy can best\r\nbe deceived.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n24. Lastly, it is by his information that the surviving spy can be used\r\non appointed occasions.\r\n\r\n25. The end and aim of spying in all its five varieties is knowledge of\r\nthe enemy; and this knowledge can only be derived, in the first\r\ninstance, from the converted spy.\r\n\r\n[As explained in §§ 22-24. He not only brings information himself, but\r\nmakes it possible to use the other kinds of spy to advantage.]\r\n\r\n\r\nHence it is essential that the converted spy be treated with the utmost\r\nliberality.\r\n\r\n26. Of old, the rise of the Yin dynasty\r\n\r\n[Sun Tzŭ means the Shang dynasty, founded in 1766 B.C. Its name was\r\nchanged to Yin by P’an Keng in 1401.\r\n\r\n\r\nwas due to I Chih\r\n\r\n[Better known as I Yin, the famous general and statesman who took part\r\nin Ch’eng T’ang’s campaign against Chieh Kuei.]\r\n\r\n\r\nwho had served under the Hsia. Likewise, the rise of the Chou dynasty\r\nwas due to Lü Ya\r\n\r\n[Lu Shang rose to high office under the tyrant Chou Hsin, whom he\r\nafterwards helped to overthrow. Popularly known as T’ai Kung, a title\r\nbestowed on him by Wen Wang, he is said to have composed a treatise on\r\nwar, erroneously identified with the _Liu T’ao_.]\r\n\r\n\r\nwho had served under the Yin.\r\n\r\n[There is less precision in the Chinese than I have thought it well to\r\nintroduce into my translation, and the commentaries on the passage are\r\nby no means explicit. But, having regard to the context, we can hardly\r\ndoubt that Sun Tzŭ is holding up I Chih and Lu Ya as illustrious\r\nexamples of the converted spy, or something closely analogous. His\r\nsuggestion is, that the Hsia and Yin dynasties were upset owing to the\r\nintimate knowledge of their weaknesses and shortcoming which these\r\nformer ministers were able to impart to the other side. Mei Yao-ch’en\r\nappears to resent any such aspersion on these historic names: \"I Yin\r\nand Lu Ya,\" he says, \"were not rebels against the Government. Hsia\r\ncould not employ the former, hence Yin employed him. Yin could not\r\nemploy the latter, hence Hou employed him. Their great achievements\r\nwere all for the good of the people.\" Ho Shih is also indignant: \"How\r\nshould two divinely inspired men such as I and Lu have acted as common\r\nspies? Sun Tzŭ’s mention of them simply means that the proper use of\r\nthe five classes of spies is a matter which requires men of the highest\r\nmental caliber like I and Lu, whose wisdom and capacity qualified them\r\nfor the task. The above words only emphasize this point.\" Ho Shih\r\nbelieves then that the two heroes are mentioned on account of their\r\nsupposed skill in the use of spies. But this is very weak.]\r\n\r\n\r\n27. Hence it is only the enlightened ruler and the wise general who\r\nwill use the highest intelligence of the army for purposes of spying\r\nand thereby they achieve great results.\r\n\r\n[Tu Mu closes with a note of warning: \"Just as water, which carries a\r\nboat from bank to bank, may also be the means of sinking it, so\r\nreliance on spies, while production of great results, is oft-times the\r\ncause of utter destruction.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nSpies are a most important element in war, because on them depends an\r\narmy’s ability to move.\r\n\r\n[Chia Lin says that an army without spies is like a man without ears or\r\neyes.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] \"Aids to Scouting,\" p. 2.\r\n\r\n[2] \"Marshal Turenne,\" p. 311.",
