NEW-YORK, OCTOBER 1, 1851. No. III.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN GODFREY SAXE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery catalogue of English poets embraces the name of Butler, though he was\r\nbut the most unpoetical of satirists. If Hudibras is poetry there can be no\r\ndifficulty in admitting to this distinction Trumbull's Progress of Dulness\r\nand McFingal, Snelling's Truth, a Gift for Scribblers, Halleck's Fanny,\r\nOsborn's Vision of Rubeta, Lowell's Fable for Critics, and some dozen other\r\nattempts in in this line, by Americans. The disease of the satiric muse in\r\nthis country has been the spleen, and the reason why we have had so little\r\nof the healthful humorous rage, ideal and lyrical, of which the old masters\r\ngave us immortal examples, is, that those among us who have attempted this\r\nkind of composition have generally had far more to do with persons than\r\nwith manners, have been influenced more by envy and malice than by a\r\ngenerous scorn of what is ludicrous and mean and criminal. The author of\r\n\"Progress\" has fallen into none of the prevailing sins; he is of the school\r\nof Horace, and has as little as he may to do with fools, while he holds up,\r\nunfolds, and whips, the follies of the day.\r\n\r\nJohn G. Saxe was born in Highgate, Franklin county, Vermont, on the second\r\nday of June, 1816, His youth was passed in rural occupations until he was\r\nseventeen years of age, when he determined to study one of the liberal\r\nprofessions, and with this view entered the grammar school at St. Albans,\r\nand, after the usual preliminary course, the college at Middlebury, where\r\nhe graduated bachelor of arts in the summer of 1839. He subsequently read\r\nlaw at Lockport in New-York and at St. Albans, and was admitted to the bar\r\nat the latter place in September, 1843, since which time he has been\r\npractising in the courts with more than the average success of young\r\nattorneys, and he is now a leading politician of the democratic party, the\r\nconductor of its local organ, the Burlington Sentinel, and District\r\nAttorney, by the grace of personal popularity--all other candidates on the\r\nsame ticket having been defeated.\r\n\r\nMr. Saxe became known as an occasional contributor to the _Knickerbocker\r\nMagazine_, some eight or ten years ago. Among his pieces in that miscellany\r\nis one characteristically remarkable for a sympathetic fitness of phrase,\r\nentitled the Rhyme of the Rail, and beginning:\r\n\r\n    Singing through the forests,\r\n      Rattling over ridges,\r\n    Shooting under arches,\r\n      Rumbling over bridges,\r\n    Whizzing through the mountains,\r\n      Buzzing o'er the vale,--\r\n    Bless me! this is pleasant,\r\n      Riding on the Rail!\r\n\r\nIn this period he has thrown off scores of epigrams, &c., anonymously,\r\nbesides the more ambitious performances acknowledged in the collection of\r\nhis Poems, of which we have before us a third edition--showing that their\r\nquality is well appreciated--from the press of Ticknor & Co. The longest of\r\nthese is Progress, first published in 1846. In skilful felicities of\r\nlanguage and rhythm, general clear and sharp expression, and alternating\r\ntouches of playful wit and vigorous sense, there is nothing so long that is\r\nso well sustained in the hundred and one books of American satire. In the\r\nbeginning of it he says finely of our \"glorious tongue:\"\r\n\r\n    Let thoughts, too idle to be fitly dressed\r\n    In sturdy Saxon, be in French expressed;\r\n    Let lovers breathe Italian,--like, in sooth,\r\n    Its singers soft, emasculate, and smooth;\r\n    But for a tongue, whose ample powers embrace\r\n    Beauty and force, sublimity and grace,\r\n    Ornate or plain, harmonious, yet strong,\r\n    And formed alike for eloquence and song,\r\n    Give me the English,--aptest tongue to paint\r\n    A sage or dunce, a villain or a saint,\r\n    To spur the slothful, counsel the distressed,\r\n    To lash the oppressor, and to soothe the oppressed,\r\n    To lend fantastic Humor freest scope,\r\n    To marshal all his laughter-moving troop,\r\n    Give Pathos power, and Fancy lightest wings,\r\n    And Wit his merriest whims and keenest stings!\r\n\r\nAnd then proceeds with a display of popular follies, and especially of\r\nthose most grotesque and offensive, the sham philosophies by which it is\r\nattempted to regenerate society:\r\n\r\n      Hail, Social Progress! each new moon is rife\r\n    With some new theory of social life,\r\n    Some matchless scheme ingeniously designed\r\n    From half their miseries to free mankind;\r\n    On human wrongs triumphant war to wage,\r\n    And bring anew the glorious golden age.\r\n    \"Association\" is the magic word\r\n    From many a social \"priest and prophet\" heard;\r\n    \"Attractive Labor\" is the angel given,\r\n    To render earth a sublunary Heaven!\r\n    \"Attractive Labor!\" ring the changes round,\r\n    And labor grows attractive in the sound;\r\n    And many a youthful mind, where haply lurk\r\n    Unwelcome fancies at the name of \"work,\"\r\n    See pleasant pastime in its longing view\r\n    Of \"toil made easy\" and \"attractive\" too,\r\n    And, fancy-rapt, with joyful ardor, turns\r\n    Delightful grindstones, and seductive churns!\r\n\r\nIn the same vein we are treated with \"novelties which disturb our peace,\"\r\nin literature, fashion, politics, religion, and morals; and every line is\r\nfaultless in finish and in wit. The Proud Miss McBride, and The New Rape of\r\nthe Lock, are in different veins, but abound in the same exquisite turns,\r\nagreeable images, and comic displays of wisdom. In the New Rape of the\r\nLock:\r\n\r\n    The gossips whispered it through the town,\r\n    That \"Captain Jones loved Susan Brown;\"\r\n      But, speaking with due precision,\r\n    The gossips' tattle was out of joint,\r\n    For the lady's \"blunt\" was the only point\r\n      That dazzled the lover's vision!\r\n\r\n    And the Captain begged, in his smoothest tones,\r\n    Miss Susan Brown to be Mistress Jones,--\r\n    Flesh of his flesh and bone of his bones,\r\n      Till death the union should sever;\r\n    For these are the words employed, of course,\r\n    Though Death is cheated, sometimes by Divorce;\r\n    A fact which gives an equivocal force\r\n      To that beautiful phrase, \"for ever!\"\r\n\r\n    And Susan sighed the conventional \"Nay\"\r\n    In such a bewitching, affirmative way,\r\n    The Captain perceived 'twas the feminine \"Ay,\"\r\n      And sealed it in such commotion,\r\n    That no \"lip-service\" that ever was paid\r\n    To the ear of a god, or the cheek of a maid,\r\n      Looked more like real devotion!\r\n\r\nAt the wedding party all the aristocracy of the circle in which the Browns\r\nand Joneses were acquainted came together, and Miss Susan--\r\n\r\n    To pique a group of laughing girls\r\n    Who stood admiring the Captain's curls,\r\n      She formed the resolution\r\n    To get a lock of her lover's hair,\r\n    In the gaze of the guests assembled there,\r\n    By some expedient, foul or fair,\r\n      Before the party's conclusion.\r\n\r\n    \"Only a lock, dear Captain!--no more,\r\n    'A lock for Memory,' I implore!\"\r\n      But Jones, the gayest of quizzers,\r\n    Replied, as he gave his eye a cock,\r\n    \"'Tis a treacherous memory needs a lock,\"\r\n      And dodg'd the envious scissors.\r\n\r\n    Alas! that Susan couldn't refrain,\r\n    In her zeal the precious lock to gain,\r\n    From laying her hand on the lion's mane!\r\n      To see the cruel mocking,\r\n    And hear the short, affected cough,\r\n    The general titter, and chuckle, and scoff,\r\n    _When the Captain's Patent Wig came off,_\r\n      Was really dreadfully shocking!\r\n\r\nThe Times, a poem read before the Boston Mercantile Library Association, in\r\n1849, Carmen Laetum, recited last year at a meeting of the Alumni of\r\nMiddlebury College, and New England Men, delivered before the literary\r\nsocieties of the New-York University a few weeks ago, are his other most\r\nelaborate productions, and they are all carefully finished and alike in\r\ntheir chief characteristics. His shorter pieces in a few instances have\r\ntouches of sentiment, but this is not his forte; by the definition which\r\nlimits poetry to rhythmical creations of beauty, Mr. Saxe can scarcely be\r\ncalled a poet of great excellence; his distinction is, that he is a wit,\r\nand that he has been eminently successful in giving to his wit a poetical\r\nexpression.\r\n\r\nAs a judicious critic has said of him, \"he unquestionably an _artist_, of a\r\nhigh order, in the narrow range which he has taken. His comical productions\r\nare beautifully finished. As they stand, they are terse, smooth, and\r\nfluent, and any one who has ever tried his hand at this species of\r\ncomposition, will readily appreciate the time, labor, and taste, which must\r\nhave been expended, to jest so easily, in rhyme.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGLASS OF BOHEMIA.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis beautiful article is manufactured in various places throughout\r\nGermany--most largely amid the very mountainous districts of Bohemia; some\r\nof the best, however, is made in Bavaria and sent to Bohemia, and thence\r\nexported. The materials from which the glass is formed consist chiefly of\r\nthe same as those used in England; the manufacturers themselves seem to\r\nbelieve that there is no difference except in the proportions of the\r\nmaterials, and in the fuel, which is exclusively wood, and produces, by a\r\nlittle attention, a more constant and intense heat than can be produced by\r\nany coal; the feeding of the furnace with the latter material, they say,\r\nalways creates a change in the temperature detrimental to the fluid above,\r\nand never sufficiently intense. The wooded mountains of Bohemia are\r\nentirely inhabited by a population whose industry, morals, hospitality, and\r\nkindliness of manners, do honor, not only to this rich and beautiful\r\nkingdom, but to the whole human race. They are pure Germans, not of\r\nSclavish origin, and the German dialect alone is spoken. Unlike every other\r\nmanufacturing district I have ever visited, they retain unimpaired all\r\ntheir rural and primitive virtues. Clean to a proverb, in their houses and\r\npersons, hospitable and amiable in their manners, simple in their habits,\r\ncheerful and devoted in their religion, they form perhaps, the happiest\r\ncommunity in the world. In passing through the country, a stranger would\r\nnever find out that he was in a manufacturing district, but might fancy\r\nhimself in the green valleys of a partly pastoral, partly agricultural\r\npeople. Thickly inhabited, the beautiful little cottages, clustered into\r\nvillages, or scattered along the glens, or sides of the hills, are\r\nembowered with fruit trees, and encircled with shrubs and flowers, which\r\neach cottager cultivates with a zeal peculiar to his race; on every side\r\nrich fields of grain or pasture stretch out like a vast enamelled carpet\r\nbetween the hills, which are clothed in dense forest of spruce, fir, pine,\r\nand beech, filled with deer, roe, and capercalzie; they extend in every\r\ndirection, far beyond the reach of the eye, one vast cloud of verdure. The\r\nfabriques or factories, are placed generally in the middle of one of these\r\nvillages, the extent of which can only be known by going from house to\r\nhouse; so closely is each hid in its own fruit-bower, and so surrounded by\r\nshrubs and flowers, that the eye can only pick up the buildings by their\r\nblue smoke, or get a glimpse of them here and there as you advance; thus\r\nsome of the villages are elongated to three miles, forming the most\r\ndelicious walk along its grassy road, generally accompanied by a stream,\r\n_always_ overhung by a profusion of wild flowers, the mountain-ash, and\r\nweeping birch; many of the former only to be found in our gardens. It has a\r\nvery picturesque effect to see the inhabitants of these villages with their\r\nsimple costume; and if it rains, their umbrellas, often of rich colors like\r\ntheir glass, scarlet, green, and deep crimson, with beautiful ruby,\r\nemerald, or turquoise handles; not such as a stranger might suppose a gaudy\r\nglass bauble, but rich and massive, and having all the appearance of the\r\nsolid, gold, and gem-studded handles of the oriental weapons.\r\n\r\nThe fabrique is built like the rest of the cottages, and only differs from\r\nthem in size, and the shape and height of its chimney, which emitting only\r\nwood smoke, has none of the dense sulphuric cloud which blackens and\r\npoisons the neighborhood of coal-fed factories: it is never that\r\nostentatious building for whose magnitude and embellishments the public are\r\nobliged to pay, in the increased charges on its productions. The glass\r\nfabriques of Bohemia are all small, in fact only one large apartment, in\r\nthe centre of which is the furnace, a circular structure divided into eight\r\ncompartments containing the melted metal for as many colors; one man and a\r\nboy are stationed at the door of each compartment, the former to extract\r\nthe fluid with his pipe, the latter to hold the wooden mould[1] in which\r\nthe article is blown and shaped. The number of hands employed in an\r\nordinary fabrique, are:--Eight men who work in the metal, take it from the\r\nfire, and blow it in the moulds; eight helps to hold the moulds, &c.; four\r\nto stir the metal, &c.; two breakers; four day laborers.\r\n\r\nThe best men are sometimes paid from eighteen to twenty shillings a week,\r\nand provide their own food, which is good; and as they require much\r\nnourishment from the exhausting effects of the heat, it consists of meat,\r\nvegetables, and a vast quantity of beer; those who are employed about the\r\nfurnace especially, drink from twelve to fifteen quarts a day; it is a\r\nclear, bitter beverage, which they, in common with all the German race,\r\nlike beyond every thing else, but it is of little strength; intoxication is\r\nalmost unknown, and as a proof of their careful and excellent character, in\r\none of the above-mentioned villages, three miles in length, a fire had not\r\nbeen known in the memory of the oldest inhabitants I questioned, though the\r\nhouses from the ground to the roof are made entirely of wood.\r\n\r\nThe materials of which the glass is composed, as far as can be ascertained,\r\nand they seem to make no secret of it, appear to be the same as those in\r\nuse in England; they say, they derive their perfection from their mode of\r\nmixing and burning the material. Thus the principal component parts\r\nare:--Sand; chalk; potash; brimstone; arsenic, mixed with various colors,\r\nregulated by the principal:--Uran oxide; cobalt oxide; coppre oxide; nickel\r\noxide; chrom oxide; minium; tin oxide.\r\n\r\nThe gold used in ornamenting the glass is from the purest ducats, dissolved\r\nin strong acid (artz wasser), the oil with which the colors are mixed is of\r\nturpentine (harz oehl).\r\n\r\nNothing is done in most of the blowing fabriques but mixing the material,\r\nand coloring; and for cutting, polishing, &c., from three to six wheels are\r\nused--all the finishing goes on in the little cottages by which the furnace\r\nis surrounded, and with which the valleys and sides of the hills are\r\nstudded; here you find, within the contracted chambers of these small\r\nblock-houses, if on the ground-flat, standing on an earthen[2] floor like\r\nour Highland cottages, an artist of the first ability, tracing the\r\nexquisite scrolls and flowers which we see in these beautiful works of art;\r\nand which are performed by men bearing all the appearance of simple\r\ncotters; but whose hand sweeps free and careless over the glass with the\r\nconfidence and ease of an experienced artist; seldom being provided with\r\nmore than two very ordinary looking brushes, a small one and another a size\r\nlarger, and working frequently without any pattern, or indicating lines\r\nupon the glass they are painting; but perfect from habitude, the scrolls,\r\nand wreaths, and flowers, come out with the same facility as one traces a\r\nname upon the dewy pane of a window. Often the whole family are brought up\r\nfrom childhood in painting and in drawing on glass, and thus producing a\r\nrace of hereditary artists; boys from thirteen and upwards are employed in\r\nthe most delicate works in this genre of art. Each cottage where the\r\npainting and gilding go on, is provided with a small oven, into which the\r\nglass is put to bake in the colors, where it is kept for a day and allowed\r\nto cool down; the white figures and flowers, when they go into the oven,\r\nare of a dark chrome color, but come out pure white, as will be observed on\r\nexamining any glass on which flowers of this color are painted; the gold,\r\nalso, when laid on, is of a dead brown, and when burnt in, is polished,\r\ngenerally by women of the family. The gold in many instances is left\r\nunpolished, and only the stalks and fibres are burnished, which give an\r\nexcellent effect. It is most interesting to go from one cottage to another;\r\nin one you are amazed by the exquisite paintings in gold, silver, and\r\ncolors; in another, the cutting out all those beautiful leaf-work, lily,\r\nbell-flower, octagon, and star-shaped vases, which is done, not only by\r\nmen, but by their children, girls and boys. In one cottage, I was\r\nparticularly struck by a man, his two daughters, and son, sitting at as\r\nmany wheels, cutting the most elaborate, but delicate, figures; shaping\r\nfrom the merely turned over bell vases, those beautiful varieties of lily\r\nand flower-indented lamps for suspension, and vessels for holding bouquets,\r\ntracing the scrolls, stalks, and fibres, with the same ease as the\r\nbare-footed wife and mother prepared their supper in the wooden bowl on the\r\nearth-floor behind them; for there was but one apartment for the fine arts,\r\nthe nursery, and the kitchen, yet all was neatness, perfect cleanliness,\r\nand order; while on the long beam which formed the sill of the three\r\nmullion windows, was arranged a number of glass objects in the glorious\r\ncolors of Bohemian art--ruby, emerald, topaz, chrysopras, turquoise; with\r\npure crystals, which, richly cut, reflected, like a rainbow, the gems by\r\nwhich they are surrounded. In another cottage, in Steinchoenau, I was much\r\npleased with the designs which two young men were painting, both in gold,\r\nand colors; of which the former were scrolls of a very superior character,\r\nand the latter, flowers, butterflies, and insects. I questioned one of the\r\nmen respecting the forms and characteristics of those he was painting, and\r\nwhich were beautiful illustrations of Natural History; when he brought me\r\nin, from a little bed-room, or rather closet, two boxes full of exquisitely\r\npreserved specimens of a great variety of native insects, which he had\r\ncollected in his leisure hours, and arranged himself, to assist him in his\r\npainting. The copies were facsimiles of the originals, both as to colors\r\nand character. Among these insects I observed a beautiful miniature\r\ncrawfish, not so large as a shrimp, a native, also, of the streams in his\r\nneighborhood. So identified had these productions of nature become with his\r\nimagination, that he was, at the moment I came in, painting some most\r\ncorrectly, without any specimen before him. It is impossible to express the\r\nfeelings produced by these people, so simple, so industrious, and, above\r\nall, _so_ modest. They could not refrain from surprise at the admiration\r\ntheir every-day productions created in us; and these simple artisans would\r\nwith difficulty believe that their works were sought for, and thus valued,\r\nin all powerful and wealthy England, where they believe nothing is unknown,\r\nnothing imperfect, nothing impossible! One man whom I visited is an\r\nextraordinary genius, rarely to be met with; he has been driven by the\r\nforce of that same genius, to seek abroad, in France and Bavaria (Munich),\r\nfood for his mind, and has brought back with him several folio works of\r\nengravings from the best masters, from which he designs. Placing before him\r\none of these works, a Raphael or a Rubens, he either copies the group, or\r\ncomposes from them to suit the form of his vase, which he thus embellishes\r\nwith the most exquisite figures; his name is Charles Antoin Guenther. He\r\nlives in a little block-house, as humble as the commonest of those above\r\ndescribed, on the declivity of a brae, by a small stream, on which stand\r\nthe little scattered village of Steinschoenau. It is composed of only two\r\napartments below, of which his work-room is one, and which is not above ten\r\nfeet square, with just space enough to hold four little lathes for\r\nengraving glass, at one of which he works himself, while the others are\r\noccupied by three boys, the youngest twelve and a-half years old, the\r\neldest fifteen! They all engrave beautifully, pieces laid before them by\r\nGuenther, and which they follow with a faithfulness and spirit only to be\r\nbelieved on personal inspection. He was at work himself on a vase goblet,\r\nof the shape of the usual green hock-glass, but which might contain a\r\nbottle; it was lapis lazuli blue, enriched by a group of Bacchanalian\r\nCupids and vine-leaves of his own composition, and worked with a spirit and\r\nfreedom worthy of some of the masters by whose works he was surrounded.\r\nWhat struck me most, was one of those exquisite little figures of\r\nRaphael's, in his great picture of the \"Madona del Sixto,\" in the Royal\r\nGallery at Dresden. The cherub leaning on the parapet, with his chin\r\nresting on one hand, as he gazes on the Virgin; it is exquisitely drawn in\r\npencil, a fac-simile, and pinned on the wooden wall of the engraver's\r\ncottage, immediately opposite his seat. I asked him how he first traced on\r\nthe glass the subjects which he was to cut; he replied by taking up a plain\r\nglass without any figure or indication on its surface, and asking me what\r\nsubject I should like engraved. On my replying that, being an old\r\ndeer-stalker, I should be very well pleased with a stag; he immediately\r\napplied the wheel to the glass, and in five minutes by my watch, produced\r\none of the most splendid, spirited animals I ever saw in the forest, and\r\nreally worthy of Landseer; the stag is making a spring over some broken\r\npalings and rough foreground, and his action and parts can only be\r\nappreciated by those who have lived with the deer on the hill and watched\r\nthem with the feelings of a hill-man, like Guenther, who has had\r\nopportunities of seeing the deer in his own native woods, where they\r\nabound. I brought this glass away with me, though in itself but an inferior\r\narticle; merely as a specimen of what I had seen done by this man in the\r\nspace of five minutes, without a copy or any thing to guide him on the\r\nsmooth surface of the goblet.\r\n\r\nI send you sketches of the artist and his dwelling; and as the portrait\r\nexhibits, at the same time, his native costume, it will be the more\r\ninteresting, and cannot fail to give a correct idea of the character of\r\nthis Bohemian mountaineer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BOHEMIAN GLASS PAINTER.]\r\n\r\nThe sketch of Guenther's House will also afford an idea of these Bohemian\r\nartisans' dwellings, more so than any written description could do. I send\r\nyou with it a drawing of another of these picturesque houses.\r\n\r\nThere are two classes of persons engaged, on a large scale, in the\r\nexportation of Bohemian glass--the fabricant and the collector; generally\r\nspeaking, however, the latter is the direct exporter, and he also\r\nsuperintends the cutting, painting, and packing. The fabricant is more\r\nfrequently engaged in furnishing the collector, and to a great extent, with\r\nthe glass in its original and more simple forms as it comes from the\r\nfurnace, and it is then cut and painted by the cottagers who surround the\r\ndwelling of the collector; so that many of these villages are entirely\r\nformed by the collector and his people. Others however, employed in the\r\nsame way, cluster round the fabrique; but even their productions for the\r\nmost part go to the collectors, who have their correspondents in America,\r\nSpain, Turkey, Greece, England, &c.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOME OF CHARLES ANTOINE GUNTHER.]\r\n\r\nAs might be expected, there is a considerable difference in the designs of\r\ndifferent houses; some are much superior to others, both as to color and\r\ndesign. Those of Egermann, in Hyda, who has added many new and valuable\r\ndiscoveries in the art of making and coloring the glass, and Hoffman, in\r\nPrague, are the best I have visited, to which may be added Zahn, in\r\nSteinschoenau, for whom Guenter engraves. Egerman's establishment in Hyda,\r\nfor cutting, painting, and engraving, is very considerable, and exhibits\r\nfirst-rate talent, which can only be appreciated by a personal inspection\r\nof his works; and the taste and judgment of Hoffman, in Prague, in his\r\nselections, the designs he gives, and the artists he employs, cannot be\r\nsurpassed, if equalled, in Germany. He has entirely abandoned the modern\r\nschool, and returned to the first principles of art,[3] and produces, both\r\nin form and decorations, subjects worthy of the ancient masters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RESIDENCE OF A BOHEMIAN ARTISAN.]\r\n\r\nThe glass villages are scattered all through the mountainous districts,\r\nwhose ridges, and summits, and upper ranges are covered with a forest,\r\nwhich extends forty or fifty miles in length, by thirty broad; the\r\nfabriquants maintain that the finer glass cannot be brought to perfection\r\nbut by wood heat, and hence, the glass fabriques are only to be found in\r\nthese vast forests. One of the most interesting natural formations within\r\nthis circle is the volcanic rock, called \"Spirlingstein,\" which shoots up\r\nout of a little valley on the right bank of the Elbe crowned with a\r\nshattered mass of natural towers and turrets which it is difficult to\r\nbelieve, till closely examined, are not the ruins of one of those feudal\r\nholds crowning the summits of so many of the hills in Bohemia. Every\r\nvillage has its school, in which are to be found all the children too old\r\nfor the nursery, and too young to be employed. Several I visited contained\r\nas many as three hundred; the specimens of their writing are beautiful,\r\nsome quite like engraving; the eldest child, whose specimen I saw, was only\r\nthirteen; they sing most sweetly, and many accompanying themselves on the\r\nguitar, the schoolmaster being almost always a musician, and capable of\r\nplaying two or three instruments. There is a church and good organ in each\r\nvillage, and a very good choir entirely composed of these villagers, all of\r\nwhom play some instrument, and form the choir by turns, generally directed\r\nby the schoolmaster. Some of these amateur bands play exquisitely, as an\r\nidea may be formed by the families or communities who occasionally visit\r\nEngland, and who are often from a district such as I have described, and\r\nwhose sole instruction has been that which they could pick up from each\r\nother in their hours of recreation. At the fabrique of A. Kittls-Erben of\r\nKreibitz, while at dinner in the garden, and which was provided by the\r\nhospitality of the fabriquant, and in great profusion, with a variety of\r\nHungarian and Bohemian wines, I observed a little girl of twelve years of\r\nage, who came into the bower with a guitar, and while I was looking round\r\nfor the performer, the master of the fabrique lifted the little girl on a\r\nchair, and laid a music book before her, from which she played and sang a\r\nnumber of Bohemian songs with much taste and execution. All the instruction\r\nshe ever had was from the schoolmaster, who taught her during the leisure\r\nhours of the scholars. She was an orphan, and brought up by the fabriquant.\r\nAfter dinner we walked up the valley to visit a fabrique of Chichorie; in\r\nthe way I remarked a little cottage, like the rest, with its fruit-trees\r\nand garden, but which had, in addition to its projecting roof and windows\r\nfilled with flowers, both in pots and _Bohemian glass_ vases, verandahs in\r\ncarved oak, the scroll-work of which was quite classic, and the execution\r\nadmirable. While I stopped to examine this, the fabriquant who accompanied\r\nme remarked that the owners were makers of musical instruments. On\r\ninquiring of what kind, he replied a variety,--violins, accordions, and\r\nothers. I was met at the door by a man whose appearance was that of a\r\nsimple cottager, and his manners indicated all the simplicity of rural\r\nlife. He was told that I wished to see some of his instruments, upon which\r\nhe bowed, slightly elevated his shoulders, and replied, that he had nothing\r\nworth seeing, but would be happy to receive us, and showed us the way, with\r\nthat natural kindness and politeness, which distinguish the peasants of\r\nthis country. We followed him up a little carved-wood staircase, and he\r\nushered us into a small, yet clean apartment, where, to my surprise, I\r\nfound two rather large organs, sufficiently large for a moderate church;\r\none was a peculiar instrument, a pan-harmomicon, invented by himself, with\r\nimprovements and great facility and simplicity in tuning; it formed a\r\nconcert of the single organ, brass horns, and kettle drums, having a double\r\nrow of keys behind, so that the performer was masked by the instrument,\r\nwhich had a handsome front; the face of it could be removed to show the\r\nwhole interior of the mechanical arrangement. A variety of other\r\ninstruments were packed in different parts of the room, some of which were\r\nlarge and highly improved accordions, which, as well as the organ, are\r\nbeautifully played by the brothers,[4] of whom there are three; their\r\ntalent for music is extraordinary.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SPIRLINGSTEIN.]\r\n\r\nThe church in this country is still the great patron of the arts. In\r\n_every_ little chapel, however remote or small, (and in some of the\r\n_minute_ villages in the mountains, they are not larger than an ordinary\r\nroom,[5] though of a vast height in proportion to the length and breadth,)\r\nis found a good organ, and always well played. There is also an amateur\r\nchoir attached to each. These chapels are decorated by paintings and\r\nfrescoes, some of which are of considerable merit. In the house of a\r\npriest, who officiates in one of them, I observed a \"Crucifixion,\" without\r\na frame, apparently quite newly painted, and, on inquiring, I found it was\r\nthe work of an artist in Antwerp; that it had been bought by the\r\nglass-makers of the district, or rather obtained in exchange for some part\r\nof a cargo sent to that city, from which they had brought and presented it\r\nto their little chapel; it was valued at Antwerp, against the glass, at\r\nseven hundred florins ($150).\r\n\r\nThe little chapels in the glass districts are also beautifully decorated\r\nwith colored glass, the rich ruby lamps suspended before the altars, with\r\ntheir ever-burning lamps, the clusters of prisms in the great centre\r\nchandelier, reflecting the ruby lights, and gold, and flowers, from the\r\naltar, are always--independent of any other feeling--subjects worthy the\r\ncontemplation of the artist. All the vases for flowers which richly\r\ndecorate the country churches are of native manufacture--ruby, emerald,\r\ntopaz, chrysophras, turquoise, and crystal chalices, full of the rarest of\r\nthose flowers which form so much the delight and pastime of the inhabitants\r\nto cultivate, shed their delicious perfume through their chapels, mingled\r\nwith the incense which, renewed daily, at morning and evening service,\r\nfills the buildings with perpetual fragrance. Another great resource for\r\nthe arts in this country, which is offered by the Church, is the sculpture\r\nof wood. I have often been surprised and confounded by seeing an exquisite\r\nVirgin, or Crucifixion, or figure of a patron or local saint, in some far\r\nout of the way chapel in the hills, or in some lonely shrine, and even in\r\nthe niches on the exterior of these buildings: but on inquiry I found that\r\nthese were often the works of the first artists! the foreman of some native\r\nCanova, or Max, whose health, impaired by inhaling the fine dust of the\r\nmarble, was not obliged to work on till death put an end to his talent;\r\nbut, before the disease had become incurable, forsook _marble_ for _oak_,\r\nand reproduced in that material all the beauties of the original; and under\r\nthe fostering wing of the Church recovered his health, and filled his\r\nnative village church with works of the highest order. It is the same with\r\nartists, natives of larger towns; I do not speak of such works as are to be\r\nseen in Antwerp, and other cities of note--wonderful productions of rare\r\nart in carving, such as the figures which stand on each side of the\r\nnumerous confessionals in the north transept of the glorious cathedral of\r\nthe former, nearly as large as life, all emblematical of repentance and\r\nforgiveness, and other attributes of contrition and mercy; with many others\r\nof nearly, if not quite, the same merit, in the various churches with which\r\nthis town abounds. These are the works of great masters whose celebrity is\r\nEuropean; but to find in the wild and unknown districts of these mountains\r\nsuch works of art--to know there is a sure and safe means for the suffering\r\nartist to continue his work and regain his health, while he fills his\r\ncountry with fine objects of art, carved in wood, and which could never be\r\nobtained in any other way, is a blessed encouragement to talent, and a\r\nfield for the arts which can only be appreciated by those who are relieved\r\nby it, or those who are dying for want of its protecting hand. Mr. Steel,\r\nin Edinburgh, the last time I had the happiness of visiting him in his\r\nstudio, when he was engaged on that exquisite work the Scott statue, and\r\nwhich has since been placed within the monument erected to that illustrious\r\nman, told me he had, then, lately lost one or two of his best men from\r\npulmonary complaint, brought on by inhaling the marble dust; that he had\r\ntried every means to counteract its effects, by providing the men with\r\nveils and masks, but to no purpose. His best man then at work upon this\r\nnational masterpiece, was fast failing beneath the effects of the same\r\ncause, and is now probably laid with all his talent in the dust, lost to\r\nhis country in the prime of life, when _here_ such a man would soon be\r\nrestored to health, while he reproduced his works in wood, and maintained\r\nhimself and family in a comfortable and illustrious independence, enriching\r\nhis country, and carrying the arts into the remote valleys of his native\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nThus far we make use of a letter to the Art Journal. In the Great\r\nExhibition we perceive that the glass of Bohemia has attracted much\r\nattention, not more for the grace and beauty of its forms than for the\r\nrecent improvements which have been made in its colors. The principal agent\r\nfor the sale of Bohemian Glass in the United States is Mr. Collamore, of\r\n447 Broadway, in whose extensive establishment may be seen in particular\r\nall the varieties of those vases, and other mantel ornaments, of Bohemian\r\nGlass, which, to a great extent, are taking the place of porcelain fabrics,\r\nof the same description, in the more fashionably furnished houses. One of\r\nthese vases we copy here from the Art Journal Catalogue of the Hyde Park\r\nExhibition; others are of different forms, and of colors equalled in\r\nrichness only in other manufactures of the same country.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nOf other industrial pursuits in this class we shall give accounts\r\nhereafter.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] The moulds are made of beech-wood.\r\n\r\n[2] These earthen floors are not, as might be supposed from their name,\r\ndirty and untidy; they are made with wet clay, which, when dry, becomes\r\nquite hard, and can be kept as clean as brick or stone.\r\n\r\n[3] This excellence in the decoration of glass is, probably, only a branch\r\nof the high proficiency of the art of engraving and carving, in Germany, on\r\nall materials--the metal work of guns, seals engraved on steel and stone,\r\nwood, ivory, up to the copper plates of landscape and history; with regard\r\nto the second, seal engraving on steel, it cannot be surpassed, and\r\nscarcely, if at all, equalled in any other part of Europe. It is wrought\r\nwith a delicacy unrivalled, and the impressions are equal to the best\r\ncutting on stone; it is done, too, at a cost wholly unknown in England,\r\neven among the lowest order of seal engravers, for initials on brass for\r\nsealing wine or sauce bottles! It is not only in the depth and sharpness of\r\nthe cutting, that they excel, but in the beauty of the drawing of the\r\nvarious subjects--figures of men, animals, birds, and the lambrequins and\r\nmantlings with which the German heraldry abounds. The cheapness arises, no\r\ndoubt, from the great patronage enjoyed by the seal engravers. Every\r\nnobleman has a large office-seal for each of his properties, and some have\r\na vast number, as, for instance, the Prince Schwartzenberg, who has upwards\r\nof _forty_; the full coat of arms is engraved on the office-seal of each\r\nlordship. Such, of old, was the case with us; and I remember, among others,\r\na beautiful gold seal, in the possession of the late Gordon of Fyvie, which\r\nhad a thin topaz, with the arms of Sealton (the ancient lords of Fyvie)\r\nengraved upon it, with the colors enamelled on the gold beneath.\r\n\r\nA comparison, however, between the prices of these works of art, here and\r\nin England, will be more satisfactory and interesting; for an office-seal,\r\nwhich would cost in the latter country, if cut on brass, from 5_l._ to\r\n7_l._, costs here from 30_s._ to 2_l._ on _steel_! including a beautifully\r\nornamented base, and polished Bohemian granite, porphyry or agate handle,\r\nthree inches in length; and such coats of arms as would cost in England, on\r\nstone, from 10_l._ to 20_l._, can be had here for a third of that sum, and\r\nexecuted in the best style of the art.\r\n\r\nCarving in ivory is equally good, and equally moderate. Pipes, also, of\r\nthat beautiful material erroneously called Meerschaum, and of large\r\ndimensions, are carved either with a superb coat of arms or historical\r\nsubjects, the prices of which vary according to the size of the pipe and\r\nnumber of figures, from 30_s._ to 2_l._!\r\n\r\n[4] Their name is Lehmann; residence--Schonfeld, near Kreibitz.\r\n\r\n[5] The ruins of similar little chapels are found all over the highlands\r\nand isles of Scotland, however remote, with other sacred edifices, in some\r\nof which may still be traced the remains of frescoes. In the ruins of\r\nlarger buildings the frescoes are more apparent: thus, in the abbey church\r\nof Pluscardine, near Elgin, the four Evangelists were distinctly visible in\r\n1826, after more than 500 years of ruin and decay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SANDWICH ISLANDS TO-DAY.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VALLEYS AND MOUNTAINS OF WAILUKU, MAUI.]\r\n\r\nWhatever may be said of the influence of European and American profligacy\r\nin the Islands, they may be pointed to with perfect satisfaction for\r\nillustrations of the benefits of Christian civilization, and the people of\r\nthis country are greatly indebted to the Rev. Henry T. Cheever, whose works\r\non the subject we have had frequent occasion to praise, for the eminently\r\njudicious and interesting accounts he has given us of society, manners, and\r\nreligion, and of industrial resources, and every kind of natural phenomena,\r\nthroughout the \"island world,\" especially in the Sandwich Islands, to which\r\nhis last work[6] is altogether devoted. Of the important question of the\r\npolitical destiny of this group Mr. Cheever says:\r\n\r\n     \"Perhaps it is in the providential plan of the world's great\r\n     Ruler, that the Sandwich Islands should yet be adopted into\r\n     the Great American Confederacy. Won as they have been from\r\n     the lowest barbarism by American missionaries,--having had\r\n     expended upon them in the process nearly a million and a\r\n     half of dollars from America, and the services of fifty\r\n     families now possessing there valuable\r\n     homesteads,--harboring a permanent American population,\r\n     foremost in energy and influence, now little short of one\r\n     thousand, besides a floating American population that touch\r\n     and recruit annually to the number of fifteen thousand, in\r\n     whaleships and merchantmen, and consuming yearly a million\r\n     of dollars' worth of American merchandise; on all these\r\n     grounds there would seem to be a propriety in their enjoying\r\n     an American Protectorate, if not an admission under the flag\r\n     of the American Republic.\r\n\r\n     \"'American enterprise,' says a writer[7] who has been for\r\n     many years familiar with the history and progress of the\r\n     Hawaiian Islands, 'both commercial and philanthropic, has\r\n     invested the group with its present political\r\n     importance--bestowing upon the inhabitants laws, religion,\r\n     and civilization--and will soon add to these gifts language;\r\n     for the English tongue is rapidly superseding the Hawaiian.\r\n     The Islanders have thus a moral claim upon the American\r\n     nation for protection. In no way can this be more\r\n     efficiently bestowed than by receiving them into the family\r\n     of this great republic. The native population are as well\r\n     prepared to be American citizens as the multitude of\r\n     European emigrants. Unlike the generality of them, they can\r\n     read and write, and have already acquired democratic ideas\r\n     under the operation of their own liberal constitution of\r\n     government, which will readily enable them to incorporate\r\n     themselves under our institutions. They are destined to be\r\n     supplanted in numbers and power by a foreign race. They\r\n     desire us to be their successors and protectors. The present\r\n     revenues of the Islands are more than adequate to the\r\n     expenses of their government--time, opportunity, the\r\n     interests of the inhabitants and ourselves point to this\r\n     result.' Events will soon determine whether they are to\r\n     retain their independency, or to be merged in the nation\r\n     that has civilized them.\"\r\n\r\nThe work abounds in interesting details of Island Life, and we regret that\r\nour limits will not permit us to enrich the _International_ with more\r\nliberal extracts. We can at present add but the following paragraphs on a\r\nsport for which the islanders have been celebrated ever since the days of\r\nCook:\r\n\r\n     \"It is highly amusing to a stranger to go out into the south\r\n     part of this town, some day when the sea is rolling in\r\n     heavily over the reef, and to observe there the evolutions\r\n     and rapid career of a company of surf-players. The sport is\r\n     so attractive and full of wild excitement to Hawaiians, and\r\n     withal so healthful, that I cannot but hope it will be many\r\n     years before civilization shall look it out of countenance,\r\n     or make it disreputable to indulge in this manly though\r\n     dangerous exercise. Many a man from abroad who has witnessed\r\n     this exhilarating play, has no doubt only wished that he was\r\n     free and able to share in it himself. For my part, I should\r\n     like nothing better, if I could do it, than to get balanced\r\n     on a board just before a great rushing wave, and so be\r\n     hurried in half or a quarter of a mile landward with the\r\n     speed of a race-horse, all the time enveloped in foam and\r\n     spray, but without letting the roller break and tumble over\r\n     my head.\r\n\r\n     \"In this consists the strength of muscle and sleight of\r\n     hand, to keep the head and shoulders just ahead and clear of\r\n     the great crested wall that is every moment impending over\r\n     one, and threatening to bury the bold surf-rider in its\r\n     watery ruin. The natives do this with admirable intrepidity\r\n     and skill, riding in, as it were, upon the neck and mane of\r\n     their furious charger; and when you look to see them, their\r\n     swift race run, dashed upon the rocks or sand, behold, they\r\n     have slipped under the belly of the wave they rode, and are\r\n     away outside, waiting for a cruise upon another. Both men\r\n     and women, girls and boys, have their times for this\r\n     diversion. Even the huge Premier (Auhea) has been known to\r\n     commit her bulky person to a surf-board; and the chiefs\r\n     generally, when they visit Lahaina, take a turn or two at\r\n     this invigorating sport with billows and board. For a more\r\n     accurate idea of it than can be conveyed by any description,\r\n     the reader is referred to the engraving.\r\n\r\n     \"I have no doubt it would run away with dyspepsia from many\r\n     a bather at Rockaway or Easthampton, if they would learn,\r\n     and dare to use a surf-board on those great Atlantic\r\n     rollers, as the Hawaiians do on the waves of the Pacific.\r\n     But there is wanting on the Atlantic sea-board that\r\n     delicious, bland temperature of the water, which within the\r\n     tropics, while it makes sea-bathing equally a tonic, renders\r\n     it always safe.\r\n\r\n     \"The missionaries at these islands, and foreigners\r\n     generally, are greatly at fault in that they do not avail\r\n     themselves more of this easy and unequalled means of\r\n     retaining health, or of restoring it when enfeebled. Bathing\r\n     in fresh water, in a close bath-house, is not to be compared\r\n     to it as an invigorating and remedial agent; and it is\r\n     unwise, not to say criminal, in such a climate, to neglect\r\n     so natural a way of preserving health, as washing and\r\n     swimming in the sea. In those who live close to the water,\r\n     and on the leeward side of the Islands, it is the more\r\n     inexcusable, for it could be enjoyed without exposure in the\r\n     dewless evenings; or in some places a small house might be\r\n     built on stone abutments over the water, and facilities so\r\n     contrived that both sexes could enjoy this great luxury of a\r\n     life within the tropics.\"\r\n\r\nThe volume has several spirited engravings, and is excellently printed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HAWAIIAN SPORT OF SURF PLAYING]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[6] Life In the Sandwich Islands, or the Heart of the Pacific, as it was\r\nand as it is.

Jarves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPHILIP PENDLETON COOKE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong our pleasantest friends in many years was the author of the\r\n_Froissart Ballads_. We think of him as a friend, but we never saw him; his\r\nfeatures are familiar to us only by this poor counterfeit, and all we know\r\nof his voice is that it has been described to us as musically joyous,\r\nsometimes varying to a sad sweetness, sometimes wild. For half a dozen\r\nyears visits to him were written of, and hoped for, and it was settled, we\r\nthought, that we were to share with him a turkey-hunt in the Old Dominion,\r\nin a few weeks, when suddenly the intelligence came that he was dead.\r\n\r\nPhilip Pendleton Cooke was born in Martinsburg, Berkeley county, Virginia,\r\non the twenty-sixth of October, 1816. His father, Mr. John R. Cooke, was\r\nthen and is now honorably distinguished at the bar, and his mother was of\r\nthat family of Pendletons which has furnished so many eminent names to that\r\npart of the Union.\r\n\r\nAt fifteen he entered Princeton college, where he had a reputation for\r\nparts, though he did not distinguish himself, or take an honor, and could\r\nnever tell how it happened that he obtained a degree, as he was not\r\nexamined with his class. He liked fishing and hunting better than the\r\nbooks, and Chaucer and Spenser much more than the dull volumes in the\r\n\"course of study.\" He had already made rhymes before he became a freshman,\r\nand the appearance of the early numbers of the _Knickerbocker Magazine_\r\nprompted him to new efforts in this way; he wrote for the _Knickerbocker_,\r\nin his seventeenth year, _The Song of the Sioux Lover_, and _The\r\nConsumptive_, and in a village paper, about the same time, humorous and\r\nsentimental verses.\r\n\r\nWhen he left college his father was living at Winchester, and there he\r\nhimself pursued the study of the law. He wrote pieces in verse and prose\r\nfor the _Virginian_, and _The Southern Literary Messenger_ (then just\r\nstarted), and projected novels and an extensive work in literary criticism.\r\nBefore he was twenty-one he was married, admitted to the bar, and had a\r\nfair prospect of practice, in Frederick, Jefferson, and Berkeley counties.\r\n\"I am blessed by my fireside,\" he wrote, \"here on the banks of the\r\nShenandoah in view and within a mile of the Blue Ridge; I go to county\r\ntowns, at the sessions of the courts, and hunt, and fish, and make myself\r\nas happy with my companions as I can.\"\r\n\r\n\"So,\" he wrote to us in 1846, \"have passed five, six, seven, eight years,\r\nand now I am striving, after long disease of my literary veins, to get the\r\nrubbish of idle habits away and work them again. My fruit-trees,\r\nrose-bushes, poultry, guns, fishing-tackle, good, hard-riding friends, a\r\nlong-necked bottle on my sideboard, an occasional client, &c., &c., &c.,\r\nmake it a little difficult to get from the real into the clouds again. It\r\nrequires a resolute habit of self-concentration to enable a man to shut out\r\nthese and all such real concerns, and give himself warmly to the nobler or\r\nmore tender sort of writing--and I am slowly acquiring it.\"\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere in which he lived was not, it seems, altogether\r\ncongenial--so far as literature was concerned--and he wrote:\r\n\r\n     \"What do you think of a good friend of mine, a most valuable\r\n     and worthy and hard-riding one, saying gravely to me a short\r\n     time ago, 'I would'nt waste time on a damned thing like\r\n     poetry; you might make yourself, with all your sense and\r\n     judgment, a useful man in settling neighborhood disputes and\r\n     difficulties.' You have as much chance with such people, as\r\n     a dolphin would have if in one of his darts he pitched in\r\n     amongst the machinery of a mill. \"Philosophy would clip an\r\n     angel's wings,\" Keats says, and pompous dulness would do the\r\n     same. But these very persons I have been talking about, are\r\n     always ready, when the world generally has awarded the\r\n     honors of successful authorship to any of our mad tribe, to\r\n     come in and confirm the award, and _buy_, if not read, the\r\n     popular book. And so they are not wholly without their uses\r\n     in this world. But woe to him who seeks to _climb_ amongst\r\n     them. An author must avoid them until he is already mounted\r\n     on the platform, and can look down on them, and make them\r\n     ashamed to show their dulness by keeping their hands in\r\n     their breeches pockets, whilst the rest of the world are\r\n     taking theirs out to give money or to applaud with. I am\r\n     wasting my letter with these people, but for fear you may\r\n     think I am chagrined or cut by what I abuse them for, I must\r\n     say that they suit one half of my character, moods, and\r\n     pursuits, in being good kindly men, rare table companions,\r\n     many of them great in field sports, and most of them rather\r\n     deficient in letters than mind; and that, in an every-day\r\n     sense of the words, I love and am beloved by them.\"\r\n\r\nSoon afterward he wrote:\r\n\r\n     \"Mr. Kennedy's assurance that you would find a publisher for\r\n     my poems leaves me without any further excuse for not\r\n     collecting them. If not the most devoted, truly you are the\r\n     most serviceable, of my friends, but it is because Mr.\r\n     Kennedy has overpraised me to you. Your letter makes me feel\r\n     as if I had always known you intimately, and I have a\r\n     presentiment that you will counteract my idleness and\r\n     good-for-nothingness, and that, hoisted on your shoulders I\r\n     shall not be lost under the feet of the crowd, nor left\r\n     behind in a fence corner. I am profoundly grateful for the\r\n     kindness which dictated what you have done, and to show you\r\n     that I will avail myself of it, I inclose a proem to the\r\n     pieces of which I wrote you in my last.\"\r\n\r\nThe poem referred to was so beautiful that we asked and obtained permission\r\nto put it in Graham's Magazine, of which we were at that time editor. The\r\nauthor's name was not given, and it excited much curiosity, as but two or\r\nthree of our poets were thought capable of such a performance, and there\r\nwas no reason why one of them should print any thing anonymously. It was\r\nmost commonly, however, attributed to Mr. Willis, at which Mr. Cooke was\r\nhighly gratified. The piece, which was entitled \"Emily,\" contained about\r\nthree hundred lines, and was a feigned history of the composition of tales\r\ndesigned to follow it, exquisitely told, and sprinkled all along with gems\r\nthat could have come from only a mine of surpassing richness. For examples:\r\n\r\n    Young Emily has temples fair\r\n    Caress'd by locks of dark brown hair.\r\n    A thousand sweet humanities\r\n    Speak wisely from her hazel eyes.\r\n    Her speech is ignorant of command,\r\n    And yet can lead you like a hand.\r\n    Her white teeth sparkle, when the eclipse\r\n    Is laughter-moved, of her red lips.\r\n    She moves, all grace, with gliding limbs\r\n    As a white-breasted cygnet swims.\r\n\r\n    I know some wilds, where tulip trees,\r\n    Full of the singing toil of bees,\r\n    Depend their loving branches over\r\n    Great rocks, which honeysuckles cover\r\n    In rich and liberal overflow.\r\n    In the dear time of long ago\r\n    When I had woo'd young Emily,\r\n    And she had told her love to me,\r\n    I often found her in these bowers,\r\n    Quite rapt away in meditation,\r\n    Or giving earnest contemplation\r\n    To leaf, or bird, or wild-wood flowers;\r\n    And once I heard the maiden singing,\r\n    Until the very woods were ringing----\r\n    Singing an old song to the hours!\r\n\r\nOne jocund morn:\r\n\r\n    I found her where a flowering tree\r\n    Gave odors and cool shade. Her cheek\r\n    A little rested on her hand;\r\n    Her rustic skill had made a band\r\n    Of rare device which garlanded\r\n    The beauty of her bending head;\r\n    Some maiden thoughts most kind and wise\r\n    Were dimly burning in her eyes.\r\n    When I beheld her--form and face\r\n    So lithe, so fair--the spirit race,\r\n    Of whom the better poets dream'd,\r\n    Came to my thought, and I half deem'd\r\n    My earth-born mistress, pure and good,\r\n    Was some such lady of the wood,\r\n    As she who work'd at spell, and snare,\r\n    With Huon of the dusky hair,\r\n    And fled, in likeness of a doe,\r\n    Before the fleet youth Angelo.\r\n    But these infirm imaginings\r\n    Flew quite away on instant wings.\r\n    I call'd her name. A swift surprise\r\n    Came whitely to her face, but soon\r\n    It fled before some daintier dyes,\r\n    And, laughing like a brook in June,\r\n    With sweet accost she welcomed me.\r\n    It was a golden day to me,\r\n    And its great bliss is with me yet,\r\n    Warming like wine my inmost heart----\r\n    For memories of happy hours\r\n    Are like the cordials press'd from flowers,\r\n    And madden sweetly.\r\n\r\nThen the poet recited ancient lays which tell some natural tales; and then:\r\n\r\n    Pity look'd lovely in the maiden;\r\n    Her eyes were softer, when so laden\r\n    With the bright dew of tears unshed.\r\n    But I was somewhat envious\r\n    That other bards should move her thus,\r\n    And oft within myself had said,\r\n    \"Yea--I will strive to touch her heart\r\n    With some fair songs of mine own art\"----\r\n    And many days before the day\r\n    Whereof I speak, I made essay\r\n    At this bold labor. In the wells\r\n    Of Froissart's life-like chronicles\r\n    I dipp'd for moving truths of old.\r\n    A thousand stories, soft and bold,\r\n    Of stately dames, and gentlemen,\r\n    Which good Lord Berners, with a pen\r\n    Pompous in its simplicity,\r\n    Yet tipt with charming courtesy,\r\n    Had put in English words, I learn'd;\r\n    And some of these I deftly turn'd\r\n    Into the forms of minstrel verse.\r\n    I know the good tales are the worse--\r\n    But, sooth to say, it seems to me\r\n    My verse has sense and melody----\r\n    Even that its measure sometimes flows\r\n    With the brave pomp of that old prose.\r\n\r\nIt was a good while before the promised contents of the book were sent to\r\nus, and Cooke wrote of the delay to a friend:\r\n\r\n     \"Procrastination is a poison of my very marrow. Moreover,\r\n     since 'the first wisping of the leaf,' my whole heart has\r\n     been in the woods and the waters--every rising sun that\r\n     could be seen, _I have seen_, and I never came in from my\r\n     sport until too much used up to do more than adopt this\r\n     epitaph of Sardanapalus: 'Eat, drink,' &c. Moreover (2d),\r\n     Mr. Kennedy and others were poking me in the ribs eternally\r\n     about my poems; and I was driven to the labor of finishing\r\n     them. I groaned and did it, and sent them to Griswold, and\r\n     have left the task of carrying them through the press to\r\n     him; and only lie passive, saying with Don Juan (in the\r\n     slave-market of Adrianople, or some other place), 'would to\r\n     God somebody would buy me.'\"\r\n\r\nAt length through his cousin and friend, John P. Kennedy--(a name that\r\nmakes one in charity with all mankind)--the MS. of all the poems was sent\r\nto us. It makes a book about the size of the printed volume, written with a\r\nregular elegance to match that of the old copyists. In an accompanying\r\nletter he says:\r\n\r\n     ... \"They are certainly not in the high key of a man warm\r\n     with his subject, and doing the thing finely; I wrote them\r\n     with the reluctance of a turkey-hunter kept from his\r\n     sport--only Mr. Kennedy's urgent entreaty and remonstrance\r\n     whipped me up to the labor. You will hardly perceive how\r\n     they should be called \"Ballads.\" You are somewhat\r\n     responsible for the name. I designed (originally) to make\r\n     them short poems of the old understood ballad cast. I sent\r\n     you the proem, which you published as a preface to the\r\n     \"Froissart Ballads.\" Words in print bore a look of\r\n     perpetuity (or rather of fixedness) about them, and what I\r\n     would have changed if only my pen and portfolio had been\r\n     concerned, your type deterred me from changing. The term\r\n     \"Froissart Ballads,\" however, is after all correct, even\r\n     with the poems as they are. The Master of Bolton is as much\r\n     a _song_ as the Lay of the Last Minstrel, although I have no\r\n     prologue, interludes, &c., to show how it was sung; and as\r\n     for Orthone, &c. Sir John Froissart may as easily be\r\n     imagined chanting them as talking them.\"\r\n\r\nAgain he wrote:\r\n\r\n     \"You will find them beneath your sanguine prognostic. They\r\n     are mere narrative poems, designed for the crowd. Poetic\r\n     speculation, bold inroads upon the debatable land--\"the wild\r\n     weird clime, out of space out of time\"--I have not here\r\n     attempted. I _will_ hereafter merge myself in the nobler\r\n     atmosphere; in the mean time I have stuck to the ordinary\r\n     level, and endeavored to write interesting stories in verse,\r\n     with grace and spirit. I repeat my fear that in writing for\r\n     the cold, I have failed to touch the quick and warm--in\r\n     writing for a dozen hunting comrades, who have been in the\r\n     habit of making my verse a _post prandium_ entertainment,\r\n     and never endured an audacity of thought or word, I have\r\n     tamed myself out of your approbation.\"\r\n\r\nThe book was at length published, but though reviewed very favorably by the\r\nlate Judge Beverly Tucker, in the Southern Literary Messenger, and by Mr.\r\nPoe, in the American Review, and much quoted and praised elsewhere, it was,\r\non the whole, not received according to its merits or our expectations. Yet\r\nthe result aroused the author's ambition, and after a few weeks he remarked\r\nin a letter:\r\n\r\n     \"My literary life opens now. If the world manifest any\r\n     disposition to hear my 'utterances,' it will be abundantly\r\n     gratified. I am thirty: until forty literature shall be my\r\n     calling--avoiding however to rely upon it pecuniarily--then\r\n     (after forty) politics will be a _sequitur_.\r\n\r\n     \"It has occurred to me to turn my passion for hunting, and\r\n     'my crowding experiences' (gathered in fifteen or sixteen\r\n     years of life in the merriest Virginia country society) of\r\n     hunting, fishing, country races, character and want of\r\n     character, woods, mountains, fields, waters, and the devil\r\n     knows what, into a rambling book. Years ago I used to devour\r\n     the 'Spirit of the Times.' Indeed, much of my passion for\r\n     sports of all kinds grew out of reading the 'Spirit.' Like\r\n     Albert Pike's poet, in 'Fantasms,' I\r\n\r\n        'Had not known the bent of my own mind,\r\n         Until the mighty spell of 'Porter' woke\r\n         Its hidden passions.'\r\n\r\n     Only Albert Pike, says 'Coleridge' and 'Powers' for 'Porter'\r\n     and 'passions.' Then, I have a half-written novel in my MS.\r\n     piles, with poems, tales, sketches, histories, commenced, or\r\n     arranged in my mind ready to be put in writing, _to order_.\r\n     In a word, I am cocked and primed for authorship. My life\r\n     here invites me urgently to literary employments. My house,\r\n     servants, &c. &c.,--all that a country gentleman, really\r\n     wants of the goods of life,--are in sure possession to me\r\n     and mine. I want honors, and some little more money. Be good\r\n     enough, my dear sir, to let me know how I am to go about\r\n     acquiring them.\"\r\n\r\nWe wrote with frankness what we thought as true, of possible pecuniary\r\nadvantages from the course he proposed, and were answered:\r\n\r\n     \"What you say about the returns in money for an author's\r\n     labors is dispiriting enough,--and I at once give over an\r\n     earnest purpose, which I had formed, of writing _books_.\r\n     Thank God, I am not dependent on the booksellers, but have a\r\n     moderate and sure support for my family, apart from the\r\n     crowding hopes and fears which dependence on them, would no\r\n     doubt generate. But I must add (or forego some\r\n     gratifications) two or three hundred dollars per annum to my\r\n     ordinary means. I might easily make this by my profession,\r\n     which I have deserted and neglected, but it would be as bad\r\n     as the tread-mill to me; I detest the law. On the other\r\n     hand, I love the fever-fits of composition. The music of\r\n     rhythm, coming from God knows where, like the airy melody in\r\n     the Tempest, tingles pleasantly in my veins and fingers; I\r\n     like to build the verse cautiously, but with the excitement\r\n     of a rapid writer, which I rein in and check; and then, we\r\n     both know how glorious it is to make the gallant dash, and\r\n     round off the stanza with the sonorous couplet, or with some\r\n     rhyme as natural to its place as a leaf on a tree, but\r\n     separated from its mate that peeps down to it over the inky\r\n     ends of many intervening lines.... That unepistolary\r\n     sentence has considerably fatigued me. I was saying, or\r\n     about to say, that I would be obliged to you for information\r\n     as to the profitableness of writing for periodicals.\"\r\n\r\nFrom this time Mr. Cooke wrote much, but in a desultory way, and seemed, in\r\na growing devotion to a few friends, and in the happiness that was in his\r\nhome, to forget almost the dreams of ambition. He had commenced an\r\nhistorical novel to be called \"Lutzen,\" in which that great battle was to\r\nend the adventures of his hero; this he threw aside, and his love for that\r\nage appeared in \"The Chevalier Merlin,\" suggested by the beautiful story\r\nof Charles the Twelfth, as given by Voltaire, several chapters of which\r\nappeared in the Southern Literary Messenger. In the same magazine he\r\nprinted \"John Carpe,\" \"The Two Country Houses,\" and other tales, parts of a\r\nseries in which he intended to dramatize the whole life and manners of\r\nVirginia. As for any applause that these might win for him, he wrote to his\r\nfriend John R. Thompson:\r\n\r\n     \"I look upon these matters serenely, and will treat renown\r\n     as Sir Thomas More advises concerning guests; welcome its\r\n     coming when it cometh, hinder not with oppressive eagerness\r\n     its going, when it goeth. Furthermore, I am of the temper to\r\n     look placidly upon the profile of this same renown, if,\r\n     instead of stopping, it went by to take up with another;\r\n     therefore it would not ruffle me to see you win the honors\r\n     of southern letters away from me.\"\r\n\r\nThe chivalric poetry had filled his mind early and long, and he was only\r\nbanishing it for the more independent and beautiful growth of his nature,\r\nwhen his untimely death destroyed hopes of fruits which the productions of\r\nhis youth seemed to precede as blossoms. He died suddenly, at his home, on\r\nSunday, the 20th of January, 1850, at the age of thirty-three.\r\n\r\nAt the time of his death he was writing \"The Women of Shakspeare,\" \"The\r\nChariot Race,\" and a political and literary satire.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly Philip Pendleton Cooke was one of the truest poets of our day,\r\nand what he has left us was full of promise that he would become one of the\r\nmost famous. Of his love poems, this little song, written when he was\r\nscarcely more than twenty, is perhaps the finest:\r\n\r\n\r\nFLORENCE VANE.\r\n\r\n    I loved thee long and dearly,\r\n        Florence Vane;\r\n    My life's bright dream, and early\r\n        Hath come again;\r\n    I renew, in my fond vision,\r\n        My heart's dear pain,\r\n    My hopes, and thy derision,\r\n        Florence Vane.\r\n\r\n    The ruin lone and hoary,\r\n        The ruin old,\r\n    Where thou didst hark my story,\r\n        At even told,----\r\n    That spot--the hues Elysian\r\n        Of sky and plain----\r\n    I treasure in my vision,\r\n        Florence Vane.\r\n\r\n    Thou wast lovelier than the roses,\r\n        In their prime;\r\n    Thy voice excelled the closes\r\n        Of sweetest rhyme;\r\n    Thy heart was as a river\r\n        Without a main;\r\n    Would I had loved thee never,\r\n        Florence Vane.\r\n\r\n    But fairest, coldest wonder!\r\n        Thy glorious clay\r\n    Lieth the green sod under----\r\n        Alas the day!\r\n    And it boots not to remember\r\n        Thy disdain----\r\n    To quicken love's pale ember,\r\n        Florence Vane.\r\n\r\n    The lilies of the valley\r\n        By young graves weep,\r\n    The pansies love to dally\r\n        Where maidens sleep;\r\n    May their bloom, in beauty vying,\r\n        Never wane\r\n    Where thine earthly part is lying,\r\n        Florence Vane!\r\n\r\nWe cannot quote others; in the lines \"To my Daughter Lilly,\" may be\r\ndiscovered the tenderness and warmth of his affections; in his Ballads, the\r\nfiery and chivalrous phase of his intelligence; in \"Ugolino,\" his pathos;\r\nin \"Life in the Autumn Woods,\" his love of nature; and in all his writings,\r\nthe thoroughly healthy character of his mind.\r\n\r\nAs a boy and as a young man, we understand, his life was always\r\npoetical--apart, original, and commanding affectionate respect. As he grew\r\nolder, and married, he became practical in his views, reaching that point\r\nin the life of genius in which its beautiful ideals take the forms of duty\r\nor become the strength of wise resolves. Toward his family, including his\r\nfather, mother, brothers, and sisters, he cherished a deep and unfaltering\r\ndevotion. A short time before his last illness he introduced into his\r\nhousehold morning and evening prayers. He died, as he had lived, a\r\npure-minded gentleman and humble Christian.\r\n\r\nOf his personal appearance a just impression is given by the portrait at\r\nthe beginning of this article. His carriage was graceful and upright; his\r\nframe vigorous and elastic, trained as he was by constant hunting in the\r\nBlue Ridge; his hair was black and curling; his eye dark and bright; his\r\nexpression calm and thoughtful; his manner impressed with dignity.\r\n\r\n    ----\"Lycidas is dead, dead ere his prime,\r\n    Young Lycidas, and hath not left his peer.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. HUNTINGTON ON COPYRIGHT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe author of _Alice_ and _Alban_ has written the following piquant letter\r\non the important subject of INTERNATIONAL COPYRIGHT.\r\n\r\n_To the Editor of the Morning Chronicle._\r\n\r\nAs an American deeply interested in the subject of international copyright,\r\nand much struck by the fallacies of some of the speakers at a meeting of\r\nauthors and publishers, recently reported in the London journals, may I, as\r\nthe subject is fresh so long as it is undecided, beg of your courtesy a\r\nlittle space to point them out.\r\n\r\nLet me begin by admitting the force of most that was said by the\r\ndistinguished chairman on that occasion, Sir Edward Bulwer Lytton. No man\r\nliving, perhaps, has a better right than he to complain of my countrymen,\r\nto whose intellectual pleasures and moral instruction he has contributed\r\never since I was a boy, out of the hard labor of his brains--helping to\r\nenrich our publishers and booksellers, and to stimulate all the trade\r\nconnected with bookmaking, and vivifying the circulation of magazines and\r\nnewspapers--for all which he has never received a penny. The same may be\r\nsaid of Dickens, whose works are of course as familiar to us as to you, and\r\nwhose characters have become a part of our stock of ideas, more precious\r\nthan the gold from our new-discovered mines. It is true that neither of\r\nthese great men has benefited us so much as he might have done if we had\r\npaid for our pleasure honorably, for the influence of genius is like that\r\nof grace--the fertilizing shower falls in vain on the arid, stony places of\r\nselfish and unjust enjoyment. Charles Dickens has never received a penny\r\nfrom us, although we insulted our unpaid creditor when he came among us by\r\nasking him to Boz balls and dinners, given on a scale of splendor which\r\nshowed how well we could have afforded to pay our debt if we had been\r\nhonest enough to have admitted it. How degrading--how incongruous--for a\r\ngreat nation, such as we boast of being, to be thus the literary\r\npensioners, the intellectual beggars of England, meanly enjoying what we\r\nwon't pay for? An American would scorn to be fed or clothed gratis; he\r\nwould \"stand treat\" with the world; yet he lets an Englishman (of all men!)\r\ngratuitously amuse his leisure, satisfy his thirst for knowledge, and\r\nclothe the nakedness of his mind. If Sir Edward Bulwer Lytton, or Mr.\r\nDickens, were to offer to pay for a pair of trousers for Brother Jonathan,\r\nhe would knock him down; or if Miss Bell, or whatever is the name of the\r\nlady who wrote \"Jane Eyre,\" and her sisters, pretended to make him up a\r\ndozen fine shirts as a charity, I think he would go out of his senses. He\r\nwould rather go bare to the end of his days than owe such an obligation to\r\nany he or she Briton in existence; but what are such favors to those which\r\nhe unblushingly accepts, year after year, from Sir Edward Bulwer and Miss\r\nBell?\r\n\r\nBut I think, sir, with submission, that an injury has been done to the\r\ncause of copyright by resting it on false abstract grounds, which cannot\r\nbe, and never have been, carried out. If a man has a rightful monopoly in\r\nhis book, merely because he has produced it, your law is unjust and\r\npiratical in fixing a term to copyright--for why should you take away a\r\nman's property after he has enjoyed it a certain number of years? On the\r\ncontrary, one would suppose that the longer he has enjoyed it the more\r\nperfect his right, and the greater the wrong to deprive him of it. Time\r\nconverts even what is unjustly acquired into a legitimate possession--how\r\nmuch more that which the owner has actually created? I would put the matter\r\non simple, concrete grounds, which all men can appreciate. The production\r\nof books is an element of civilization, by the common consent of nations.\r\nBooks cannot be produced unless in some way they procure the authors a\r\nsubsistence. And whoever produces by his labor a beneficial thing, is\r\nentitled to a reasonable compensation from those who are thereby benefited.\r\nIn former times, when readers were scarce, as copies were costly, the rich,\r\nor sovereigns, supported authors directly, by pensions or otherwise. It is\r\nnow conceded that the best mode of rewarding them is by allowing them an\r\nexclusive copyright in their works, and all civilized nations do so. But\r\nthis mode of remuneration being once established, a foreign author, coming\r\npersonally, or in his work, into a country, \"has as much moral right to his\r\nbook as he has to his baggage,\" and it is as barbarous to plunder him of\r\nthe one as of the other. Why, when was there a time in Europe, or even in\r\nAsia or the antique world, that princes and states did not receive and\r\ncherish, and nobly reward, foreign men of letters? Are they to be more\r\nignobly treated now that the people have become patrons? But, if deaf to\r\nthe voice of honor, hear that of justice. Those who enjoy their works are\r\nbound to remunerate them for what they have produced at a great expenditure\r\nof time, money, and soul-wearing labor. That \"the laborer is worthy of his\r\nhire,\" is a divine sentence which sooner or later will judge all those by\r\nwhom that hire is by fraud \"kept back.\" A country which refuses a fair\r\ncopyright to authors, whether native or foreign, condemns itself to\r\nbarbarism. It cultivates in itself a spirit of violence, aggravated by\r\ningratitude to benefactors. There is, too, a sort of indelicacy in this\r\ninjury, which even the law of reprisal cannot excuse. The benefit which the\r\nauthor of genius confers is something personal. You might as well, if some\r\nsavage tribe ravished your women, condemn its females, when captured, to\r\ninsult and dishonor.\r\n\r\nMoreover, to refuse copyright to any class of authors (and here, again, I\r\nagree with Sir Bulwer), is to refuse it, in part, to all. The native author\r\nis robbed of his just hire by such a law, as much as the foreigner. I am\r\ncompelled by the existing law of American copyright to part with my books\r\nfor a sum which is under their natural price, and which is not a\r\nremunerating price, because I am undersold by reprints for which the\r\nauthors are paid nothing. Look the fact in the face, ye readers of cheap\r\nreprints, who are unwilling to abandon an unjust privilege, which affords\r\nyou so much pleasure at so low a rate. I have written a book. I have spent\r\nyears in writing or learning to write it. Perhaps I could do nothing else.\r\nThe influence of the literary atmosphere in which all who read the English\r\nlanguage are forced to live, acting on my special organization, has made\r\nliterary production a necessary resource. It is the same as if I were a\r\npoor shirt-maker, over whose sorrows a Hood has taught you to weep and be\r\nindignant. At all events, you approve of my writing, or you would not have\r\nread my book so extensively. And yet, because you can refuse to pay foreign\r\nauthors for books of the same kind, you oblige me to take a nominal price\r\nfor mine--a price for which it could not be produced by any man living, and\r\nless than it would command if you honestly paid for such labor in other\r\ninstances. You have beaten me down most unfairly. I consider it so; and if\r\nevery one of the 10 or 12,000 buyers of the cheap edition of \"Lady Alice\"\r\nwere to send me a \"quarter\" (1_s._) by mail, I should regard it as a simple\r\nrestitution; nor would the sum total cover my expenses while writing it.\r\n\r\nSo far, then, Sir Edward Lytton and myself (if it is not too great\r\npresumption in me to join myself with him) cordially agree. And further, it\r\nis a most nonsensical and absurd policy for a country thus to swamp its\r\nnative literature, and to depress and degrade the whole class of native\r\nwriters. No nation can afford to let foreigners write for it; it would be\r\nas unwise as to let them fight its battles. I may add that no nation can\r\nafford to embitter its own writers against itself by producing in their\r\nminds a sense of injustice. Strong as our feeling of nationality\r\nundoubtedly is, it will not stand this for ever. It has seemed strange to\r\nsome that an American should have written such a book as \"Lady Alice,\" the\r\nauthor of which appears, at first sight, to have expatriated his mind, if\r\nnot his heart. His being an episcopal clergyman accounts for it in\r\npart--for the Church is essentially of Old England, and its clergy and more\r\ndevoted members are morally domiciled in England, with whose institutions\r\nand social system they have a stronger sympathy than with those of their\r\nown country. Moreover, for years, he lived only among Englishmen of that\r\nclass which is most intensely attached to things as they are--a part of the\r\ntime in England itself. These circumstances made the thing possible. But\r\ndespair of obtaining any thing like a fair copyright for an American book\r\nmade it actual--led him to lay aside a projected American story, and try\r\nhis hand at an English novel, with a bent less serious: at first, indeed,\r\nnot without some idea of caricature, in a gay, lawless, audacious spirit,\r\nin defiance of cant of every kind: but the calm, methodical, somewhat\r\nmechanical [Greek: ethos] of actual English life, when he saw it and felt\r\nits restraints, tamed down these peculiarities somewhat. The result was a\r\nbook which truly excited more surprise than sympathy in England--but which,\r\nin America, proved its real nationality by bursting in a trice all the\r\nbonds of clique, and, in spite of its acknowledged faults, securing near a\r\nhundred thousand readers in a few months. If copyright had been protected\r\nas it ought, I should have been reimbursed by so large a sale; but, as it\r\nwas, even this successful book paid me less than a day laborer could have\r\nearned in the time I was writing it, in any part of the States.\r\n\r\nBut now I want Sir Edward Bulwer Lytton and Mr. Colburn to tell me what\r\ngood it will do English authors and publishers for you to imitate in this\r\nrespect the injustice and folly of your transatlantic cousins. Because\r\n\"literature is in a depressed state,\" which Sir Edward asserts to be a\r\nfact--and because Mr. Colburn cannot afford to give one hundred pounds for\r\na book for which once he would have given L1000--they propose, if I\r\nunderstand them, to have recourse to an unlimited pirating of American\r\nliterature. I should think (if your British pride will tolerate the\r\nexpression of my opinion) that the true remedy would be to give a stringent\r\ncopyright to American authors. Pray which injured the English book-market\r\nmost--Mr. Colburn's issue of a few hundreds of \"Lady Alice\" at a guinea and\r\na half, or Mr. Bohn's issue of as many thousands of Mayo's \"Kaloolah\" at a\r\nshilling? Or do they think, as Sir E. Bulwer Lytton seems to imply, that,\r\nexcept Cooper and Irving, we have no authors whose works are readable in\r\nBritain? \"Typee,\" and \"The Scarlet Letter,\" and \"The Reveries of a\r\nBachelor,\" and the two works above mentioned, tell a different story. Who\r\ncan deny the genius and artistic power of Hawthorne, or the clear English\r\nsimplicity of his style? And if Ik Marvel falls much behind Geoffrey\r\nCrayon, we, their countrymen, are no judges--although it is true that the\r\nformer has fallen upon an affected age. I admit our deterioration. Or is it\r\nsupposed that we shall cease producing if the possibility of English\r\ncopyright is taken away? That would be a great mistake. Men who have a\r\nvocation for it will write, well or ill, even if they starve, as London\r\ngarrets can testify. And there is no danger of our starving absolutely.\r\nSuccessful books pay their authors, not adequately, but enough to keep soul\r\nand body together. In light literature (so-called, perhaps, because it\r\ndemands entire devotion and unceasing toil to arrive at excellence in\r\nit)--in light literature, which pays best here as well as elsewhere, there\r\nis a distinct demand for native works, which all the competition of the\r\ncheap pamphlet novels of the Harpers cannot wholly extinguish, and it is by\r\nthe feeble, but real aid of this national taste that we exist. For my part,\r\nI feel a sort of Coriolanus pride in having got nothing, as I may say, for\r\na book which had an unprecedented run; and if my countrymen object, as some\r\nof them do, to its principles, I tell them fairly that beggars cannot be\r\nchoosers. I can live, thank Heaven, in many ways. I could not, indeed, keep\r\nschool--as my countrymen, I believe, think every literary man should, the\r\nbetter to amuse them at his own expense. Two such drains on the\r\ncerebro-nervous system would soon lay me beneath the sod. But I can invest\r\nwhat remains of my patrimony in wild land, till it for my bread, and write\r\na tale every winter, in defiance of the buccaneers.\r\n\r\nBut suppose that we continue to write (as we shall, depend on it), and that\r\nour impracticable Congress--from the difficulty of getting it to look at\r\nany question not bearing upon \"Who is to be the next President?\" or from\r\nthe general apathy in regard to the injuries of authors, and want of\r\nperception as to the important interests of the heart--will not or does not\r\npass an international copyright law, what sense or what honesty will there\r\nbe in your strangling yourselves meanwhile by permitting Mr. Bohn his\r\nblack-flag reprisals? Whom do you injure by this species of retaliation?\r\nFirst, and chiefly, your own authors and publishers, and your own\r\nliterature (and, therefore, you must abandon such a policy sooner or\r\nlater); and next, your friends on this side the water. For what does our\r\ngovernment care if our native authors, even of the highest ability, earn\r\nless than common stevedores? Not a rush. Do the people enjoy our works with\r\na less magnanimous gusto, because we have coined our brains and hearts in\r\ncomposing them for bread and patched elbows? Will they be less, in their\r\nown estimation, the greatest, the freest, the wisest, and the most\r\nenlightened nation upon earth? You retaliate, gentlemen, by injuring those\r\nwhose sufferings (greater than yours) are already disregarded by the power\r\nyou would influence; and if you ruined them, you would not ruffle one\r\nself-complacent feather of the American eagle. You but do what you can to\r\ndepress and extinguish the only class of Americans who have a direct\r\ninterest in getting you what you want, and who are already as eager to\r\nobtain it as men usually are to protect themselves from ruinous\r\ncompetition. I do not know what you expect from such a method, unless you\r\nthink that our government, which has no pity on its native men of letters,\r\nwill be touched by the distresses of yours.\r\n\r\nBelieve me, further, that it is the most unlikely way to succeed with the\r\nAmerican people, to offer them an international copyright as a matter of\r\nbargain. They immediately suspect a design of obtaining an advantage for\r\nyou, without any real equivalent to themselves. Show them, by granting a\r\nfree and perfect copyright to all the world, on the same terms as your own\r\nsubjects, that you regard such a course as the true policy of every state\r\n(which it is), and you will be much more likely to gain a hearing. I see\r\nnothing in this movement against foreigners getting a copyright, but\r\nselfishness overreaching itself.\r\n\r\nThe Americans are sometimes obtuse to appeals to their sense of justice,\r\nwhen they have an immediate interest in repudiating the claim. I admit it\r\nwith regret, but it cannot be denied. They do not know how to relinquish\r\nthe present advantages of a cheap pirated literature--forgetting that the\r\nendless reading of cheap books is a vice, and that this deluge of foreign\r\nunder-priced novels and magazines, good, bad, and indifferent, is washing\r\naway every manly national taste. But on the other hand you are too\r\ngrasping. It is undignified and unbecoming. Why should you so eagerly\r\nclutch at a foreign sale for your works, as to sacrifice what you can\r\nsecure--freedom from injurious competition at home? For my own part (and I\r\nam sure I speak the sentiments of every American writer of respectability),\r\ngive me on this side of the Atlantic, what you may have on yours at\r\npleasure--a fair chance, without being under-bid by pirates--and I ask no\r\nmore. I will cheerfully relinquish all the advantage to be drawn from an\r\nEnglish sale. Without vanity, justly as we are charged with it, or boasting\r\n(our national infirmity--heaven knows we came honestly by it), all we want\r\nis \"a fair field\" at home, \"and no favor,\" and we will write books, if not\r\nintrinsically so good as those of English authors, yet more congenial to\r\nthe tastes, and better adapted to supply the intellectual wants, of our\r\ncountrymen.\r\n\r\nTo conclude: although the American people appear at times obtuse, as I have\r\nsaid, on the question of justice, and take, as in this instance, a \"mighty\r\nnarrow\" view of expediency, they are very open to an appeal to their\r\ngenerosity. Present a bill--above all, an unusual bill--to Brother\r\nJonathan, and he may dispute it, or turn his back on you with all the\r\ncoolness imaginable; but offer to contribute your sovereign for those poor\r\ndevils of authors, and he is up to the gentlemanly thing--he will cover\r\nyour subscription with an eagle. I should be glad to persuade him to do\r\njustice under the idea that it was a sort of charity, convinced as I am\r\nthat, as soon as he had done it, he would see the true nature of the\r\ntransaction, and blush to have ever stood out about so plain a thing. You\r\nEnglishmen pretend, even in your national capacity, to believe the Bible (I\r\nwish it were true of either us or you). There is one passage which I\r\ncommend to your consideration, as bearing directly on the practical\r\nsolution of this question, and sustaining my view of it by a sentence which\r\ncannot fail: \"Give and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed\r\ndown, and running over, shall men give into your bosom. For with the same\r\nmeasure that ye mete withal shall it be measured to you again.\" And there\r\nis another maxim more universal still, which among us is thus familiarly\r\nexpressed: \"Do as you would be done by.\" By reversing Lord Campbell's\r\ndecision, you will act ungenerously, that's certain, and I think, unjustly,\r\nyou will injure your own writers more than ours, and rob us of one of our\r\nstrongest arguments.\r\n\r\n                       I remain, sir, very respectfully yours,\r\n\r\n                         THE AUTHOR OF \"LADY ALICE.\"\r\n    New-York, July 26.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"THE SCIENCE OF DECEPTION.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the title of a chapter in \"The Age of Veneer,\" a series of papers\r\nappearing from month to month in _Fraser's Magazine_. At the beginning of\r\nit a certain preeminence is claimed for England which some have thought\r\nbelonged to our own country, but we are not unwilling to yield the\r\ndistinction:\r\n\r\n     \"The science of deception has of late years attained an\r\n     immense importance in this good realm of Britain. In other\r\n     lands,--as, for example, in France or in America,--it is\r\n     practiced with more or less of success and perfection; but\r\n     the inherent superiority of the Anglo-Saxon race has\r\n     asserted itself even in this sinister and questionable\r\n     pursuit, so that we may fairly claim as decided a\r\n     preeminence in the arts by which fools are gulled and ruled,\r\n     as in those more honorable and useful ones by which we have\r\n     attained a moral dominion over the opinions and tastes of\r\n     mankind. There may be more _finesse_ in the system of the\r\n     French deceivers, or the American 'humbug' may, like the\r\n     other indigenous productions of that remarkable land, be a\r\n     very monster in the grandeur of his conceptions, and the\r\n     enormous force brought to bear on their development; but for\r\n     real, sound, profitable, business-like work in this peculiar\r\n     line, we back the Britishers against all the world. Like\r\n     every thing done in the country, their operations in the art\r\n     of deception are steady, systematic and sure.\r\n\r\n     \"We conceive that we have a right to speak of the 'science'\r\n     of deception, for it has all the dignity, symmetry, and\r\n     order of the nobler sciences. It has its mysteries, which\r\n     are utterly unknown to the uninitiated; it has also its\r\n     professors, who are men very often raised by the admiration\r\n     of their own dupes to positions of high honor and great\r\n     profit. The organization and regulation of its minor\r\n     ministrants are also complete, and ere a man can hope to\r\n     reach the high places and carry off the rich prizes, he must\r\n     go through many grades, and master many secrets, both in\r\n     theory and practice. Once initiated, he is able to effect\r\n     results, by comparison with which the glory and the honors\r\n     reaped by successful soldiers or great discoverers sink into\r\n     insignificance.\r\n\r\n     \"In a former number an attempt was made to explain some of\r\n     the means resorted to for the manufacture of public opinion\r\n     in England, through the journals and other agents, by which\r\n     the public ear is monopolized. We showed that almost any\r\n     desired 'public opinion' might be made to order; that there\r\n     were great contractors, who would not only undertake the\r\n     duty, but who would also fulfil their undertakings. That\r\n     similar processes exist in other countries cannot admit of a\r\n     doubt, but it is questionable whether the corresponding\r\n     effects in France or America are not produced upon a much\r\n     lower and more ignorant class of the community, and whether\r\n     there are in those countries such masses of wealthy,\r\n     intelligent, and educated persons willing to be cajoled,\r\n     fleeced, and laughed at, as those we find in our own dearly\r\n     beloved country. It might, perhaps, be proved that the arts\r\n     of which we speak succeed with the superior classes of our\r\n     countrymen in a much larger proportion than with similar\r\n     classes elsewhere. This science of deception has, of course,\r\n     for its basis, the production of particular 'opinions,' and\r\n     the creation of peculiar preferences in the public mind; but\r\n     although the great contractors for political opinion are, of\r\n     all the practitioners, the most perfect adepts, their _modus\r\n     operandi_ is far more difficult, and the secret of their\r\n     power far more occult than in the case of the general\r\n     professors or the charlatans.\r\n\r\n     \"Except for the lower class of Frenchmen or Americans such\r\n     tactics as these are unavailing; all the rest have enough\r\n     penetration to see through the whole scheme; but in England\r\n     it is possible to lead by the nose persons who not only\r\n     ought to know better, but who in all other transactions of\r\n     life evince the utmost shrewdness and aptitude.\"\r\n\r\nIn this series of papers on the _Age of Veneer_, a general confession of\r\nnational sins and weaknesses is made by John Bull, and he is shown to have\r\nas discerning an apprehension for his own character as he ever had for that\r\nof any of his neighbors. The \"Age of Veneer\" is a happy title, and it gives\r\nalone a better idea of English society and manners than can be derived from\r\nsome hundreds of volumes on the subject that have been printed within our\r\nrecollection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTS AMONG THE AZTECS AND INDIANS.\r\n\r\nWRITTEN FOR THE INTERNATIONAL MAGAZINE\r\n\r\nBY THOMAS EWBANK\r\n\r\n_United States Commissioner of Patents, author of \"Treatise on Hydraulics\",\r\n&c._\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the antiquary and student of ethnology on this continent there are few\r\nsubjects more interesting than those early industrial arts, which, better\r\nthan any thing else, illustrate the civilization of the Aztecs, and their\r\nrude neighbors, the aborigines of the more northern parts of the country.\r\nAn attempt is made in the following pages to define, in certain respects,\r\nthe extent, and justly to represent the character, of those efforts, made\r\nbefore the Discovery, and repeated, with more or less uniformity, by\r\nportions of the American races until the present time. I have copied from\r\nthe great work of Lord Kingsborough on Mexican Antiquities, four uncouth\r\nfigures, of which the originals are native drawings sent to Spain by\r\nAntonio de Mendoza, the successor of Cortes, and first viceroy of New\r\nSpain. It will be confessed that few things could give us a more correct\r\nimpression of the condition and character of the peoples subdued by Cortes\r\nand Pizarro than we may derive from these pictures.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Aztec Goldsmith at work. From Mendoza's Collection.]\r\n\r\nIn this drawing the artist has represented a workman in the act of\r\nsoldering or annealing a piece of plate. Except the rude style in which the\r\nnative limners portrayed the human figure, the cut is a fac-simile of\r\nPharaonic profiles of the same class of workmen, and of modern goldsmiths\r\nof Africa, Hindustan, Java, Sumatra, Ceylon, and Asia generally. The small\r\nportable furnace, the blowpipe, the position of the operator, the\r\nscantiness of his apparel, and the absence of any bench, are common to all;\r\nthe only observable difference is in the apron (suspended by long\r\nshoulder-straps) of the American, who, in this respect, seems to have\r\nadvanced beyond his brethren of the other hemisphere. Had the draughtsman\r\npossessed the skill of a modern artist, and painted the tools and processes\r\nused, in fusing the metal, in spreading it out into plates, working it into\r\nshape, and chasing in the ornaments, in drawing wire, and fabricating the\r\nfamous old Panama chains, &c., many other problems of Aztec economy and art\r\nwould have been solved. The smiths of Mexico, Central America, and Peru,\r\nwere expert in the use of the blowpipe; and this is not to be wondered at,\r\nif, as early Spanish writers report, the bellows was unknown among them. In\r\nspecimens of their industry which are extant the soldering rivals any thing\r\nexecuted in modern workshops, and seams often challenge and sometimes defy\r\nthe keenest scrutiny to detect them. Native smiths still use the pipe.\r\n\r\nEvery enlightened worker in metals must feel interested in thus beholding\r\nan ancient red man in the actual use of the blowpipe, to say nothing of the\r\nillustration the figure affords of the state of the arts in ante-Columbian\r\nepochs, and of ancient life in this part of the world. The use of the\r\nblowpipe has been inferred from metalline remains discovered in sepulchral\r\ntumuli of the Mississippi valley. In Caleb Atwater's _Antiquities of the\r\nWest_, (Columbus, 1833, pages 92-3,) mention is made of sixty copper beads,\r\nfound in one of the mounds at Grave Creek, near Wheeling. \"They were made\r\nof a coarse wire, which appeared to have been hammered out, not drawn, and\r\nwere cut off at unequal lengths; _they were soldered together_ in an\r\nawkward manner, the centres of some of them uniting with the edges of\r\nothers; they were incrusted with verdigris, but the inside of them was pure\r\ncopper; which fact shows that the ancient inhabitants were not wholly\r\nunacquainted with the use of metals.\" As it is admitted that _brass_ was\r\nnot known to the mound-builders, an analysis of the alloy that constituted\r\nthe brazen solder here alluded to would be a positive addition to the\r\nlittle knowledge we have gleaned of these early native workers and of their\r\narts.\r\n\r\nNo matter how far man is separated from his fellows, either on the earth's\r\nsurface or by time, the general uniformity of his nature is stamped on all\r\nhis normal devices. Primitive inventions are universally similar. Under\r\nagreeing circumstances and conditions, the same means are hit upon to\r\nproduce the same ends. Kindred trains of thought, of resources and results,\r\ncharacterize the origin and early progress of the arts every where. They\r\nbegin in the same wants, and suggest the same ideas, which are carried out\r\nin substantially the same ways. Still, when a primitive people is found\r\nshut from communion with others--isolated from the rest of the world and\r\nderiving no suggestions from it--some shades of difference, more or less\r\nstrongly defined, often mark means they discover, in common with others,\r\nand this whether occupiers of small islands or of widespread continents.\r\nBut after all, this is only what may be called a variety of _expression_,\r\nthe same general idea being differently brought out, just as in speech the\r\nsame thoughts are displayed in various idioms. All arts and all machines\r\nare but dialects of one language--reasonings and conclusions in tangible\r\nforms and figures--a universal speech, understood by all men.\r\n\r\nOf the diverse exhibitions of a primitive and common suggestion, a more\r\ninteresting example cannot well be adduced than the processes for the\r\nfabrication of thread, which have been disclosed on this half of the globe.\r\nThey appear so different from others, and so remarkable, if not unique,\r\nthat it may safely be said, if the first spinsters were foreigners, their\r\nmode of spinning was indigenous, however difficult, if not impossible, it\r\nmay be to reconcile one suggestion with the other.\r\n\r\nSpinning lies at the threshold of human culture. It was the first or among\r\nthe first born of the arts, and was doubtless the offspring of woman's\r\ningenuity. Through all the past ages it was within the peculiar province of\r\nthe sex. In it queens and even goddesses sought to excel; one of the\r\nearliest of useful efforts, it was one of the best; till it was introduced,\r\nman was a houseless wanderer, and where it is unknown, he is still a\r\nvagabond, roaming the forest. Home and its softening and soothing\r\ninfluences had no existence, till woman began to twirl the spindle. Till\r\nthen the fount of the arts was unopened, unthought of, undreamt of. A\r\nuniversal acquirement, it is one in which little variation in details could\r\nbe looked for among uncultivated tribes. It is, however, singular, that the\r\nthread-making idea has been less skilfully developed by the red race than\r\nperhaps any other of their mechanical conceptions. This is a striking fact,\r\nin peoples so far advanced as were the Mexicans, Peruvians, and others.\r\n\r\nThe distaff has been identified with spinning in the eastern world from the\r\nearliest times. It dates far behind historic and was a common thing in\r\nheroic epochs. It pervades the most ancient legends, and plays a part in\r\nthe remotest myths. No other instrument of domestic economy is seen through\r\nthe semi-historic clouds that are about the infancy of human progress; few\r\nothers could be named as belonging to lower strata of time. Common in the\r\nother hemisphere through unknown periods, it was utterly a stranger in\r\nthis.\r\n\r\nOf the offices assigned to the fates, that of Clotho was to hold the\r\ndistaff, while Lachesis twirled the spindle, and Atropos determined the\r\nlength of the thread. Then there was Hercules, who was playfully rapped\r\nover the head by Omphale, for his awkwardness in this service.\r\nSardanapalus, too, endeavored to rival the son of Jupiter, by spinning\r\namong his maids. Ancient Egyptian spindles and distaffs have been recovered\r\nfrom the tombs; and how common they both were among the Hebrews appears in\r\nSolomon's portrait of a virtuous woman: \"She seeketh wool and flax--she\r\nlayeth her hands to the spindle, and her hands hold the distaff.\" Both\r\nspindle and distaff were frequently dedicated to Minerva, the patroness of\r\nspinning and of the arts connected with it. The goddess was herself rudely\r\nsculptured with them in the Trojan Palladium.\r\n\r\nA glance at these classic implements, before introducing the primitive\r\nAmerican apparatus, will better enable us to perceive the differences\r\nexisting between them, more correctly to appreciate both, and to judge how\r\nfar one is allied to or could have been derived from the other.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Distaff and Spindle--Ancient Greek and Roman.]\r\n\r\nThis figure is from a series of bas-reliefs representing the arts of\r\nMinerva, upon a frieze of the Forum Palladium at Rome. It exhibits the\r\nprocess of spinning, at the moment when the spinner has drawn out a\r\nsufficient length of thread from the distaff, and just previous to the act\r\nof taking it out of the slit on the top of the spindle, to wind it on that\r\ninstrument. It is said by classic writers that the spindle was always, when\r\nin use, accompanied by the distaff, as \"an indispensable part of the\r\napparatus.\" The following particulars are gathered from Homer, Herodotus,\r\nOvid, Horace, Catullus, Pliny, and others: The spindle was a stick, ten or\r\ntwelve inches long, having at the top a slit or notch, by which to fix the\r\nthread at the commencement; the lower end was passed through and attached\r\nto a small but heavy disc or whirl, made of wood, stone, or metal. The\r\nweight of this and of the spindle, kept the thread at a proper tension, and\r\nthe momentum while turning round kept the yarn or thread twisting in the\r\ninterval of repeating the operation with the fingers. When, from the length\r\nof the thread, the spindle approached the ground, or descended below the\r\nreach of the fingers, the thread was wound on the spindle, except a short\r\npiece left for insertion in the slit, preparatory to the formation of\r\nanother length. The distaff was about three times as long as the spindle,\r\nand commonly made of a reed, with an expansion near the top, over which the\r\nprepared flax or wool was placed, and secured by a ribbon or tape; the\r\nfibres being left sufficiently loose to be easily drawn out by the fingers\r\nand thumb of the spinner. Distaffs as well as spindles of gold and of ivory\r\nwere ascribed to goddesses, and were presented to distinguished women.\r\n\r\nIt was quite common for ancient females to keep their spindles whirling\r\nwhile on their way to the fountain for water, or in making short visits,\r\n&c. Some striking examples have been recorded by historians, and among them\r\nthe following, by Herodotus: \"As Darius, king of Persia, was sitting\r\npublicly in one of the streets of Sardis, he observed a young woman of\r\ngreat elegance and beauty, bearing a vessel on her head, leading a horse by\r\na bridle fastened round her arm, and at the same time spinning some thread.\r\nDarius viewed her as she passed, with intense curiosity, observing that her\r\nemployments were not those of a Persian, Lydian, nor indeed of any Asiatic\r\nfemale. Prompted by what he had seen, he sent some of his attendants to\r\nobserve what she did with the horse. They accordingly followed her. When\r\nshe came to the river, she gave the horse some water, and then filled her\r\npitcher, and having done this, she returned by the way she came, with the\r\npitcher of water on her head, the horse fastened by a bridle to her arm,\r\nand, as before, employed in spinning.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Distaff and Spindle--Modern Asiatic and European.]\r\n\r\nIn the rural districts of old Rome, women were forbidden to spin while\r\ntravelling on foot. The prohibition arose from superstitious feelings; but\r\nthe practice has come down to our times, being found more or less common in\r\nSpain, Portugal, Hungary, Italy, Greece, and other parts of Europe, as also\r\nover the greater part of Asia. The shank of the distaff on such occasions\r\nwas secured by a sheath or strap to the person; or, as in the preceding\r\nfigure of a modern spinner, was held under the left arm.\r\n\r\nHow differently the idea has been worked out by the ancient inhabitants of\r\nthis hemisphere, will appear in the two next illustrations. They are coarse\r\nand uncouth, yet of unusual interest and value in an historical survey of a\r\npeople who at the Conquest stood at the head of the aborigines, but whose\r\nnationality and power have been broken, and whose arts have all but\r\nvanished before those introduced by the whites.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Aztec Girl Spinning. From Mendoza's Collection.]\r\n\r\nThe figure represents a girl, six years old, learning to spin, in the\r\npresence of her mother, whose portrait is omitted. She is in the act of\r\nwinding on the spindle the length of thread just spun. The spindle differs\r\nbut little from those of the eastern races, its lower end being furnished\r\nwith a conical weight or fly, to promote rotation, and, as it would seem,\r\nfor its pointed extremity to rest like a pivot in some small cavity while\r\nrevolving; for the spindle, when in use, was not raised from the ground:\r\nthe reverse of the eastern practice, in which the motion ceased the moment\r\nthe ground was touched by the spindle. The basket-like base on which the\r\nfly rests, is the Mexican symbol of the ground, though possibly it may here\r\nrepresent an implement or utensil also. The bunch of cotton to be spun,\r\nafter being suitably prepared, was held in the left hand, and the length of\r\nthread formed at one operation was determined by the distance the bunch\r\ncould be drawn away from the spindle, this being also the converse of the\r\nAsiatic and European practices, in which the distaff, and cotton on it, are\r\nat rest--the length of thread depending on the descent of the spindle from\r\nthem. We know that domestic industry was strictly enforced by the Mexicans,\r\nparticularly on girls; and of this, these cuts are remarkable\r\nillustrations.\r\n\r\nIn the next, a female adult (as the headdress shows) is portrayed at the\r\nmoment when a full length of thread has been twisted, or she is in the act\r\nof finishing it. To this spindle _two_ conical weights were attached,\r\nunless the under one was fixed and had a cavity on the top to admit the\r\npoint of the upper one to play in it. The process differs but little from\r\nthat of the present Pimos and Maricopas tribes, as mentioned hereafter,\r\nexcept in the hollow in which the spindle turns. It is obvious that this\r\npractice is incompatible with walking; locomotion can only be associated\r\nwith a spindle suspended by the thread, and whirling free above the ground.\r\nIn this absence of the distaff, and especially in twirling the spindle like\r\na top _on the floor_, the process can never be viewed as one derived from\r\nabroad; but rather as a result solely of primitive ingenuity. No people,\r\ncivilized or savage, of the eastern hemisphere, are known to have thus\r\nembarrassed the movements of the spindle. The idea and the practice appear\r\nto be purely American. No ancient American spinner is represented at work\r\neither when seated or standing--much less when walking.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Aztec Woman Spinning. From Mendoza's Collection.]\r\n\r\nFor the following illustration and description the patent office is\r\nindebted to Mr. Squier, late United States Charge to Nicaragua. It is\r\ninteresting as showing how little the old native process has been changed.\r\n\r\nThe common foot-wheel is extensively used in spinning cotton in Nicaragua;\r\nbut the simple contrivance in use before the Conquest is not yet entirely\r\nsupplanted. It consists of a spindle of hard wood, sixteen or eighteen\r\ninches in length, which passes through and is fixed to a disc of heavy wood\r\nthat serves as a fly, by adding momentum to the whirling spindle. The lower\r\nend of the spindle is rounded or rudely pointed, and when in use the\r\ninstrument is placed in a calabash or clean iron kettle.\r\n\r\nThe mode of operation is as follows: The spinster is seated on a stool,\r\nwith a bunch of loose cotton already prepared, in her lap. From this she\r\ntwists a thread with her finger, and attaches the end to the spindle at the\r\ntop, giving it an energetic twirl that keeps it going for some time.\r\nMeanwhile she disengages and draws out the cotton, from her lap, with both\r\nhands. The length of thread spun (from two to three feet) is then wound\r\naround the spindle, which is again set in motion, and another length added\r\nin the same manner.\r\n\r\nIn the accompanying sketch, _b_ is the spindle, _c_ the thread already\r\ntwisted, _d_ the disc or fly, and _f_ the calabash. When the spindle is not\r\nin motion, the calabash prevents it from falling over, the fly resting\r\nagainst the sides.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Modern Spinning Apparatus of the Central American Indians.]\r\n\r\nIn the regions of the Gila and Colorado the natives have been little\r\ndisturbed by Europeans. The Spaniards never extended their iron sway over\r\nthem, and, like the Araucanians of Peru, they have been supposed to retain\r\nmany of the customs and arts of their ancestors. This is to some extent\r\ntrue. The country soon after the Conquest was reported to be occupied by a\r\ncivilized people, who followed agriculture and dwelt in stone houses.\r\nColonel Emory, in his _Notes of a Military Reconnaissance, from Fort\r\nLeavenworth in Missouri to San Diego in California, including part of the\r\nArkansas, Del Norte, and Gila Rivers_, (Washington, 1848,) met with remains\r\nof stone and adobe houses, scattered over extensive tracts of\r\ncountry--sometimes continued over ten, fifteen, and even twenty miles. The\r\nPecos tribe, he remarks, have preserved alive, till within a few years, the\r\nsacred fire that glowed on the ancient altars; nor is it certain that it is\r\nnot yet preserved, for a few Indians took it with them to the Pueblos of\r\nZuni. The name of Montezuma is said to be as familiar to those Indians, to\r\nthe Apaches, Navajos, and others, as that of Washington is to us.\r\n\r\n\"Turning from some old ruins towards the Pimos village,\" says Colonel\r\nEmory, \"we urged our guide to go fast, as we wished to see as much of his\r\npeople as the day would permit. We were at once impressed with the beauty\r\nand order of the arrangements for irrigating and draining the land. Corn,\r\nwheat, and cotton are the crops of this peaceful and intelligent people.\r\nAll the crops have been gathered in, and the stubbles show that they have\r\nbeen luxuriant. The cotton has been picked and stacked for drying on the\r\ntops of the sheds. The fields are subdivided by ridges of earth into\r\nrectangles of about 200 x 100 feet for the convenience of irrigating. The\r\nfences are stakes wattled with willow and mezquite, and in this particular\r\nset an example of economy in agriculture worthy to be followed by the\r\nMexicans, who never use fences at all.\" The thatched houses of the Pimos\r\nare dome-shaped, and of wicker work, about six feet high, and from twenty\r\nto fifty feet in diameter. In front is usually a large arbor, on the top of\r\nwhich cotton in the pod is piled for drying.\r\n\r\nA Pimos spinster was observed at work. Her apparatus was more simple than\r\nthat in the preceding figures, but closely allied to them; in fact the\r\nsame, with the exception of the calabash or basket, for which a more ready\r\nsubstitute, one always ready, was adopted. \"A woman was seated on the\r\nground under the shade of one of the cotton-sheds; her left leg was tucked\r\nunder her, and her foot was turned sole upwards; between her big toe and\r\nthe next was a spindle about eighteen inches long, with a single fly of\r\nfour or six inches; now and then she gave it a twist in a dexterous manner,\r\nand at its end was drawn a coarse cotton thread. Such was their spinning\r\njenny.\" This application of the toes is like that practised by the wives\r\nand daughters of the Hindoo weavers: the axles of their light cane reels\r\nare thus held when winding off the thread. The foot however is in front of\r\nits owner, and in a natural position, nor does the stick grasped by the\r\ntoes revolve.\r\n\r\nThe Pimos and Maricopas are in their habits, agriculture, religion, and\r\nmanufactures, the same.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Indians Spinning Coarse Thread.]\r\n\r\nA process of undoubted antiquity, and occasionally followed by modern\r\nIndians, is shown in the above engraving. The spinner holds in the left\r\nhand, horizontally, a short piece of hollow reed or cane, within which the\r\nspindle is twirled by the fingers and thumb of the right hand. Sometimes a\r\ncross stick or handle is attached, as represented in the figure. A second\r\nperson performs the part of a distaff, which, as the thread lengthens,\r\nrecedes from the spinner, or the spinner from it. A section of this\r\nprimitive apparatus is separately portrayed.\r\n\r\nMr. Van--a delegate now in Washington from the Cherokee nation, to obtain a\r\nsettlement of claims on the United States for their lands in Georgia,\r\nAlabama, &c.--states that the large old spinning-wheel has, to his\r\nknowledge, been in the possession of the Cherokees nearly fifty years. His\r\nmother, a Creek, and over a hundred years of age, he believes, used to spin\r\nwith it in her youth. Mr. Van has seen Indians twist coarse thread with\r\napparatus like that here represented, and which in all probability formed\r\none of the contrivances that slowly led to the whirling spindle, in both\r\nhemispheres.\r\n\r\nFor the next two illustrations of spinning, by the Navajoes, Camanches, and\r\nother tribes of New Mexico, the Patent Office is indebted to Judge Peters,\r\nof Santa Fe, New Mexico.\r\n\r\nWe have here another instance in which the thread-making idea has\r\nmanifested itself among the red race, and a very interesting one. The\r\nspinner has a small stick, which she holds horizontally in one hand, and on\r\nit winds the thread, as on a spindle, as fast as it is spun. The bunch of\r\ncotton is itself twirled round by means of a short and small rod, passed\r\nthrough the lower part, with its ends projecting. A pebble is commonly\r\nfastened to the middle of this stick (_d_), and serves as a fly to keep up\r\nthe motion, and assist, by its weight, in drawing out the thread. To keep\r\nthe stone and stick in their places, a piece of yarn is wound loosely round\r\nthe bunch. The length of thread is seldom over six or eight inches, before\r\nit is wound on the stick. In this singular process, the classical mode is\r\ncompletely reversed--the spindle, or that which corresponds to it, is held\r\nat rest, and the distaff put in motion, in which respect the operation is\r\nunique. The idea of increasing the momentum of the whirling mass by the\r\nintroduction of a weight into its centre is here realized.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Comanche Spinning.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Navajoes Spinning.]\r\n\r\nIn the case illustrated below, two pieces of board or shingle are pinned to\r\nopposite sides of the fork of a small tree or stump. A spindle (a smooth\r\nrod ten or twelve inches in length) is passed through, and made to turn in\r\nthem, as in two journals. See the section S, where _a_, _a_ is the spindle\r\nand _b_, _b_, the boards, and _c_ a pin to keep the spindle in its place.\r\nTo whirl the spindle, a cross stick, _d_, is tied to the large end.\r\nSometimes a stone is folded in a piece of cloth, and fastened to each end\r\nof the cross stick, which answers the purpose of a rude flywheel. When a\r\nsuitable stick, having a branch at right angles, can be procured, the cross\r\nstick and spindle are of one piece, as at S. A notch is made at the small\r\nend of the spindle, where the thread unites to it, and thus, while one girl\r\nturns the spindle, another, with a bunch of loose cotton, supplies it, and,\r\nas the thread lengthens, gradually recedes from it. As soon as a full\r\nlength is twisted, it is wound round the spindle, another length is added,\r\nand so on, till the spindle is fully charged. The thread is then wound off\r\ninto a hank, and the spindle set again for working.\r\n\r\nThese illustrations of primitive art possess a deeper and a more extensive\r\ninterest than that of their relation to a few Indian tribes; they are types\r\nof thought, more or less common to the species, to barbarous and\r\nsemi-civilized people of all times; such as we ourselves would adopt, were\r\nwe thrown on our own resources, without any knowledge or recollection on\r\nthe subject.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Aztec Girl Weaving. From Mendoza's Collection.]\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to determine from this figure whether the shuttle was\r\ndeveloped in ancient Mexico. It is not represented, and appears not to have\r\nexisted any more than the distaff. The loom is like those now used by\r\nAmerican Indians. Colonel Emory, after speaking of the Pimos spinning,\r\nsays, \"Led on by this primitive display, I asked for their loom, by\r\npointing to the thread and then to the blanket girded about the woman's\r\nloins. A fellow stretched in the dust, sunning himself, rose up leisurely,\r\nand untied a bundle, which I had supposed to be a bow and arrow. This\r\nlittle package with four stakes in the ground, was his loom, and he\r\nstretched his cloth and commenced the process of weaving. He had no\r\nshuttle, the warp being passed across the woof, a thread at a time, by a\r\nlong wooden needle. One of the rods in the preceding figure is doubtless\r\ndesigned to represent a needle, and was used in the same way.\" If the\r\nfigures here introduced truly indicate the progress made by the Aztecs in\r\nspinning and weaving, their advance was very moderate; and though very\r\ncreditable work might be made with this weaving apparatus, by individual\r\nskill and patience, it would seem that few or no attempts had been made to\r\nrender it more facile and efficient. The same remark is, however,\r\napplicable to the looms of Asia and Africa. It is worth noting, that the\r\ndress of females, pictured above, indicates a decided improvement on that\r\nof less civilized tribes. Aztec women and girls wore pantalettes, and a\r\nspecies of tunic, with short sleeves and ornamental borders, not unlike the\r\nChinese female costume, except in the shortness of the sleeves. Amulets or\r\nkeepsakes, suspended over the neck and resting on the bosom, seem also to\r\nhave been common.\r\n\r\nModern Peruvian Indians spin without the distaff, and their loom is\r\nprecisely like the ancient one just represented--the shuttle, or what\r\nanswers the purpose of one, being a long thorn needle, which is passed\r\nthrough the woof, thread by thread. Every piece is woven of the precise\r\nwidth wanted, whether for garments, cocoa-bags, or any thing else, with no\r\nwaste by cutting. Ancient specimens of cloth, of excellent execution, have\r\nbeen found in their tombs. The length of the needles varies with the width\r\nof the piece to be woven.\r\n\r\nThat very fine fabrics were produced in Old Mexico, and by implements\r\nlittle if at all better than those here figured, is doubtless true. The\r\nhighly colored accounts by the conquerors are believed to have been fully\r\nwarranted by the fineness of the goods which they saw. Indeed, some of the\r\nrichest of modern shawls and dresses, turned out of the looms of Persia,\r\nEgypt, and Hindostan, are but a degree superior to those of the Aztecs.\r\nPersonal tact and skill are every thing with semi-civilized artisans. The\r\nancient spindle and loom of the East, singularly enough, are still\r\npreserved and used for special purposes in modern Rome, just as they were\r\nthirty or forty centuries ago. A recent writer on the Pallium (an\r\necclesiastical robe of lamb's wool) says, there stands about a mile outside\r\nthe Porta Pia, on the road to Tivoli, an old convent of nuns, attached to\r\nthe still more ancient church of St. Agnes; that these nuns are poor, and\r\nrarely receive any of Rome's high-born damsels to their lonely and\r\nneglected cloister; but that they have a small paddock appendant to the\r\nmonastery, and therein keep a couple of sacred lambs, (not necessarily of\r\nthe Merino breed,) and are proud and happy ministrants of their wool for\r\nthe texture of this noble decoration, spinning it, not by any new-fangled\r\njennies, but on the old patriarchal spindle, and weaving it in a loom of\r\nwhich the pattern might date from the days of Penelope.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, we may remark, of this subject, that to the substitution of\r\ncircular for straight motions, and of continuous for alternating ones, may\r\nbe attributed nearly all the conveniences and elegances of civilized life.\r\nIt is not too much to assert that the present advanced state of science and\r\nthe arts is due to revolving mechanism. We may speak of the wonders\r\neffected by steam and other motive agents, but of what value would they\r\nhave been without this means of their employment? The applications of\r\nrotary in place of other movements are conspicuous in modern history, from\r\nthose which propel steamships through the water and locomotives over land,\r\nto those which are employed in the manufacture of pins and the pointing of\r\nneedles. It is by this principle that the irregular motion of the ancient\r\nflail and the primeval sieve, has become uniform, in threshing, bolting,\r\nand winnowing machines; and hence our circular saws, shears, and slitting\r\nmills; the abolition of the mode of spreading out metal into sheets with\r\nthe hammer, for the more expeditious one of passing it through rollers or\r\nflatting mills; and the revolving oars, or paddle wheels, for the\r\npropulsion of vessels--the process of inking type with rollers in place of\r\nballs, the rotary printing presses, and revolving machines for planing iron\r\nand other metals, instead of the ancient process of chipping off\r\nsuperfluous portions with chisels, and that still more tedious of smoothing\r\nthe surfaces with files. But in few things is the effect of this change of\r\nmotion more conspicuous than in the modern apparatus for preparing,\r\nspinning, and weaving vegetable and other fibres into fabrics for clothing.\r\nThe simple application of rotary motion to these processes has changed the\r\ndomestic economy of the world, and increased the general comforts of our\r\nrace a hundred fold.\r\n\r\nThe birth of the arts here, and not least among them that of the humble one\r\nof spinning, has relation to a problem in American ethnology of great and\r\nincreasing interest--_the early occupancy or first peopling of this\r\nhemisphere_. Were there through countless ages no eyes or hearts here to\r\nrespond to the smiling heaven, none to taste the teeming fruits or inhale\r\nthe aroma of flowers? Was the placid atmosphere never moved by the prattle\r\nand laughter of children, the songs of birds, or the sudden start of\r\nquadrupeds arrested by the presence of the race ordained to rule over them,\r\nuntil a few straggling members of that race arrived (perhaps driven hither\r\nby tempests) from abroad, to claim the splendid heritage? If the red man\r\nwas not indigenous to the soil, if the first settlers were aliens, how\r\nnatural the desire to know who they were, whence they came, and how, and\r\nwhen, and over what regions extended the first rights of preemption! to ask\r\nwhether they left no memorials in the languages that have come down to us,\r\nin legends, manners, customs, traditions, religious observances and rites,\r\nno signs in arts, utensils, arms, or other relics extant? whether they left\r\nno marks in earth-works--those most lasting of records--in quarries and\r\nentrenchments, in mines, tumuli, and mounds?\r\n\r\nIt is reasonable to suppose--and difficult to suppose otherwise--that if no\r\nhuman form was ever reflected from the surfaces of these lakes and rivers,\r\nno human voice heard in these forests, the imprint of no human foot left on\r\nthese sands, until colonized from another continent, the arts of that\r\ncontinent must have been considerably advanced before the means of\r\ntransport, or inducements to emigrate, were evolved; and under any\r\ncircumstances, a knowledge of the most essential, would be brought over. Of\r\nthese, such as related to domestic habits and the occupations of women,\r\nwould be prominent, and among these spinning most of all. When once\r\nintroduced, this art could not have been lost, indispensable as it is to\r\nthe savage and demi-savage condition, and the original process or\r\nprocesses, whencesoever derived, unless superseded by better, would have\r\nbeen continued by every generation.\r\n\r\nNow, if the mothers of the American race came from any of the early\r\nadvanced sections or outskirts of Eastern civilization, they brought the\r\ndistaff and spindle with them, yet nothing of the kind was found at the\r\nconquest. It cannot of course be imagined that they, or their descendants,\r\ncould have been induced to throw the former away, and to embarrass the\r\nmovements of the latter in a calabash or basket. Efficient previous\r\npractice, and acquired habits and expertness, could never have been laid\r\naside for such rude, and laborious, and unproductive substitutes. We know\r\nthat the distaff and spindle have never been lost where once known, in the\r\nold world. Neither civil commotions or revolutions, nor duration of time,\r\naffected them, in Egypt, Assyria, Greece, Italy, Carthage, Persia, Scythia,\r\nAsia-Minor, or any of the great or small theatres of past history. The\r\nlaws, learning, science, arts, and races, which once flourished in those\r\ncountries, have mostly vanished, but women still spin there as they did\r\nthirty or forty centuries ago; and so it is here also. The principal\r\nmechanical devices of the old Mexicans, Nicaraguans, Peruvians, Chilians,\r\n&c., are no longer known; the means by which the stone architecture, the\r\nbasaltic and porphyritic sculptures of Cusco, Uxmal, Copan, Palenque, and\r\nother Aztec remains scattered over the continent, were achieved, are a\r\npuzzle; yet the household labors of Indian women in those lands remain\r\nunchanged, they spin and weave with the same apparatus, and embroider, as\r\ndid their kindred in and before the times of Atahualpa and Montezuma.\r\n\r\nAdmitting that repeated emigrations took place at periods remote as that of\r\nthe Iliad, and up to the twelfth century of our era, that arrivals,\r\ndesigned or fortuitous, thus occurred, on either the Atlantic or the\r\nPacific, or both coasts--we might still more confidently expect to find the\r\ndistaff and spindle of the other hemisphere domiciled in this. If they were\r\nbrought at all, it was in hands practiced in their use, and tenacious of\r\ntheir worth. But from the Cape of Storms in the south, to the limits of\r\nhuman abodes in the north, instead of these the most awkward contrivances\r\nprevailed when the whites came, and such still are found to prevail. The\r\ninference therefore seems inevitable that the first colonists, and their\r\nsuccessors for many ages, came before spinning was known in their native\r\nplaces, or at least before the distaff had been added to the spindle; and\r\nthat the art, as practised by the Aztecs and their successors in Central\r\nAmerica at the present day, is purely of aboriginal development, and of\r\nremote antiquity, and had not before the Conquest come in contact with the\r\nbetter processes of the other hemisphere.\r\n\r\nOf the three epochs of human condition indicated by the materials of which\r\neconomical implements and weapons have been made--stone, bronze, and\r\niron--it is uncertain whether the distaff was ever developed under the\r\nfirst. The probabilities are that it was not. In the remote periods in\r\nwhich it is mentioned, some of those who possessed it had advanced far into\r\nthe second, and some had entered on the third. The great mass of the\r\noccupants of this hemisphere at the time of the Conquest were toiling in\r\nthe cycle of stone; while the Mexicans and Peruvians, the most advanced of\r\nthe red nations, had discovered and applied the properties of copper and\r\nsome of its alloys: had entered on the second, but had not progressed far\r\ninto it. Had they possessed bronze weapons equal to those of the heroic\r\nages, they might yet have preserved, in a measure, their independence and\r\nnationality.\r\n\r\nClothing is second only to food, and the clothing of nations in any degree\r\ncivilized is of woven thread. The all but paramount importance of the\r\nmanufacture of thread materials--including that made of flax, silk, cotton,\r\nworsted, and other fibrous materials--affords matter for great surprise.\r\nCompare the products of the distaff and spindle of old with that of our\r\nmills, and how difficult to realize the change which modern mechanism has\r\nwrought! The yearly amount, the lineal extent, of thread now made--who can\r\nmeasure it? It would reach from our planet to the planets in the farthest\r\nregions of space, and almost suffice for a net-work to include the whole\r\nsystem. Turn from the wood-cut illustrations here given of ancient and not\r\nyet obsolete processes, to modern manufactures, and it would seem that\r\nwhile in the space of time which it took Grecian Helens, Syrian Naahmahs,\r\nor Mexican Penelopes, to prepare an annual supply of clews for their\r\nfamilies, the myriads of spindles now twirling, by steam and water, produce\r\nenough to use the Asteroids as balls on which to wind it and as bobbins\r\nfrom which to reel it. Even a century ago, a single mill, driven by water,\r\nis said to have spun or reeled 73,726 yards of silk--_i.e._, between forty\r\nand fifty miles--at each revolution of the motive axle.\r\n\r\nPatent Office, Washington, September, 1851.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORIGINAL POEMS BY BARRY CORNWALL AND W.

And, lo! on thy accused track\r\n    Rush the dread furies; lo! afar I see\r\n    The hoary AEgeus, watching for his son,\r\n    His son that nears him still with hastening oars,\r\n    Unknown, that nears him but to dash him down,\r\n    Moaning, to darkness and the dreadful shades\r\n    The while, thy grief wails after him in vain:\r\n    And, lo, again the good Gods glad my sight\r\n    With vengeance; blood again, thy blood, I see\r\n    Streaming;--who bids Hippolytus depart\r\n    But thou--thou, sword of lustful Phaedra's hate\r\n    Against thy boy--thy son--thy fair-haired boy;\r\n    I see the ivory chariot whirl him on----\r\n    The maddened horses down the rocky way\r\n    Dashing--the roaring monster in their path;\r\n    And plates and ivory splinters of the car,\r\n    And blood and limbs, sprung from thee, crushed and torn,\r\n    Poseidon scatters down the shrieking shores;\r\n    And thou too late--too late, bewail'st in vain.\r\n    Thy blindness and thy hapless darling's fate.\r\n    And think'st of me, abandoned, and my woe;\r\n    Thou who didst show no pity, to the Gods\r\n    Shrieking for pity, that my vengeful cries\r\n    Drag thee not down unto the nether gloom,\r\n    To endless tortures and undying woe.\r\n    Dread Gods! I know these things shall surely be!\r\n    But other, wilder whispers throng my ears,\r\n    And in my thought a fountain of sweet hope\r\n    Mingles its gladness with my lorn despair.\r\n    Lo! wild flushed faces reel before mine eyes.\r\n    And furious revels, dances, and fierce glee,\r\n    Are round me,--tossing arms and leaping forms.\r\n    Skin-clad and horny-hoofed, and hands that clash\r\n    Shrill cymbals, and the stormy joy of flutes\r\n    And horns, and blare of trumpets, and all hues\r\n    Of Iris' watery bow, on bounding nymphs,\r\n    Vine-crowned and thyrsus-sceptred, and one form,\r\n    God of the roaring triumph, on a car\r\n    Golden and jewel-lustred, carved and bossed,\r\n    As by Hephaestus, shouting, rolls, along,\r\n    Jocund and panther-drawn, and through the sun,\r\n    Down, through the glaring splendor, with wild bound,\r\n    Leaps, as he nears me, and a mighty cup,\r\n    Dripping, with odorous nectar, to my lips\r\n    Is raised, and mad sweet mirth--frenzy divine\r\n    Is in my veins--hot love burns through mine eyes,\r\n    And o'er the roar and rout I roll along,\r\n    Throned by the God, and lifted by his love\r\n    Unto forgetfulness of mortal pains,\r\n    Up to the prayers and praise and awe of earth.\r\n\r\n                                      W.

P. R. JAMES, ESQ.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLII.\r\n\r\nMrs. Hazleton was an observer of all small particulars. On the present\r\noccasion she had been kept alone fully ten minutes in the drawing-room, and\r\nshe was not at all pleased with this want of alacrity. Though her face was\r\nas smooth as ever when she entered the sick room, she saw that a change of\r\nfeeling, or at least a change of purpose, had taken place, and that Lady\r\nHastings felt embarrassed by a consciousness which she might not choose to\r\ncommunicate. But success had made her bold, and she loved to steer her\r\ncourse through agitated waters.\r\n\r\n\"Well, my dear friend,\" she said, with the sweet tones of her voice falling\r\nfrom her lips like drops of liquid honey, \"you do not seem quite so well\r\nto-day. I hope this business which you were to undertake has not agitated\r\nyou. Or perhaps you have not executed your intention. It could be very well\r\nput off until you are better.\"\r\n\r\nThis was intended to lead to confession; she suspected some shame at a want\r\nof resolution. But Lady Hastings remained silent, playing with her rings,\r\nand Mrs. Hazleton, a little angry--but very little--gave her one of those\r\ndelightful little scratches which she was practised in administering,\r\nsaying, \"No one knew any thing about your intentions but myself; so no one\r\ncan accuse you of weakness or vacillation.\"\r\n\r\n\"I care very little,\" said Lady Hastings, most untruly, \"of what people\r\naccuse me. I shall of course form my own resolutions from what I know, and\r\nexecute them or not, dear Mrs. Hazleton, according to circumstances--which\r\nare ever changing. What is inexpedient one day may be quite expedient the\r\nnext.\"\r\n\r\nNow, no one was more fully aware than Mrs. Hazleton that expediency is\r\nalways the argument of weak minds, and that changing circumstances afford\r\nevery day fair excuses to men and to multitudes for every kind of weakness\r\nunder the sun. Her belief was strengthened that Lady Hastings had not acted\r\nas she had promised her to act, and she replied, with an easy, quiet,\r\nhalf-pitying smile, \"Well, it is not of the slightest consequence whether\r\nyou do it now, or a week hence, or not at all. The worst that could come\r\nwould be Emily's marriage with Marlow, and if you do not care about it, who\r\nshould? I take it for granted, of course, that you have not acted in the\r\nmatter so boldly and decidedly as we proposed.\"\r\n\r\nThere was an implied superiority in Mrs. Hazleton's words and manner which\r\nLady Hastings did not like. It roused and elevated her, and she replied,\r\nsomewhat sharply, \"You are quite mistaken, my dear friend; I did all that\r\nwas ever intended. I sent for Emily and my husband, told them that I\r\nbelieved I should not live long, and made it my last request that the\r\nengagement with Marlow should be broken off.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed!\" exclaimed Mrs. Hazleton, with even too much eagerness. \"What did\r\nthey say? Did they consent?\"\r\n\r\n\"Far from it,\" answered Lady Hastings. \"My husband said he had made a\r\npromise which he could not violate on any account or consideration\r\nwhatever, and Emily was much in the same story.\"\r\n\r\n\"That shows that your decision was not strongly enough expressed,\" replied\r\nher visitor. \"I do not believe that any man or woman could be heartless\r\nenough to refuse a wife or mother's last request, if made in so solemn a\r\nmanner.\"\r\n\r\n\"They did refuse, point-blank, however,\" said Lady Hastings. \"But do you\r\nknow, Mrs. Hazleton,\" she continued, seeing a provokingly bitter smile on\r\nMrs. Hazleton's face, \"do you know, strange to say, I am very glad they did\r\nrefuse. Upon after consideration, when all anger and irritation was gone, I\r\nbegan to think it was hardly right or fair, or Christian either, to oppose\r\nthis marriage so strongly, without some better reason than I have to\r\nassign. Marlow is a gentleman in all respects, of very good family too, I\r\nbelieve. He is a good and excellent young man. His fortune, too, is not\r\ninconsiderable, his prospects good, and his conduct under the deprivations\r\nwhich we have lately suffered, and the loss of at least two-thirds of the\r\nfortune he had a right to expect with Emily, has been all that is kind, and\r\namiable, and generous.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Hazleton sat by the bedside, fixing her eyes full upon the countenance\r\nof the invalid, and betraying not in the least the rage and disappointment\r\nthat were at her heart. They were not a whit the less bitter, however, or\r\nfierce, or malignant; but rather the more so from the effort to smother\r\nthem. No one for a moment could have imagined that she was angry, even in\r\nthe least degree; and yet no disappointed demon ever felt greater fury at\r\nbeing frustrated by the weakness or vacillation of a tool.\r\n\r\nAfter staying for a moment to take breath, Lady Hastings proceeded, saying,\r\n\"All these considerations, dear Mrs. Hazleton, have made me resolve to make\r\namends for what I have said--to withdraw the opposition I have hitherto\r\nshown--and consent to the marriage.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Hazleton retired for a moment into herself. For a minute or two she\r\nwas as silent as death--her cheek grew a little paler--her eyes lost their\r\nlustre, and became dead and cold--they seemed looking at nothing, seeing\r\nnothing--there was no speculation in them. The only thing that indicated\r\nlife and emotion was a slight quivering of the beautifully-chiselled lip.\r\nThere was a word echoing in the dark chambers of her heart in replying to\r\nLady Hastings. It was \"Never!\" but it was not spoken; and after a short and\r\nthoughtful pause she recovered herself fully, and set about her work again.\r\n\r\n\"My dear friend,\" she said, in a sweet tone, \"you have doubtless good\r\nreasons for what you do. Far be it from me to say one word against your\r\ndoing what you think fit; only I should like to know what has made such a\r\nchange in your views, because I think perhaps you may be deceived.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no, I am not deceived,\" replied Lady Hastings, \"but really I cannot\r\nenter into explanations. I have heard a great deal lately about many\r\nthings--especially this morning; but I--I--in fact, I promised not to tell\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nLady Hastings thought that in making this distinct declaration she was\r\nperforming a very magnanimous feat; but her little speech, short as it was,\r\ncontained three separate clauses or propositions, with each of which Mrs.\r\nHazleton proposed to deal separately. First, she asserted that she was not\r\ndeceived, and to this her companion replied, with a slight incredulous\r\nsmile, \"Are you quite sure, my friend? Here you are lying on a bed of\r\nsickness, with no power of obtaining accurate information; while those who\r\nare combined to win you to their wishes have every opportunity of conveying\r\nhints to you, both directly and indirectly, which may not be altogether\r\nfalse, but yet bear with them a false impression.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, but there can be no possible doubt,\" said Lady Hastings, \"that Marlow\r\nis the heir of the Earl of Launceston.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Hazleton's brow contracted, and a quick flush passed over her cheek.\r\nShe had never before given attention to the fact--she had never thought of\r\nit at all--but the moment it was mentioned, her knowledge of the families\r\nof the nobility, and Mr. Marlow's connections, showed her that the\r\nassertion was probably true. \"It may be so,\" she said, \"but I am very\r\ndoubtful. However, I will inquire, and let you know the truth, to-morrow.\r\nAnd now, my dear friend, let us turn to something else. You say you have\r\nheard a great deal to-day, and that you have promised not to tell\r\n_me_--me--for you marked that word particularly. Now here I have a right to\r\ndemand some explanation; for your very words show that some person or\r\npersons endeavor to prejudice your mind against me. What you have heard\r\nmust be some false charge. Otherwise the one who has been your friend for\r\nyears, who has been faithful, constant, attentive, kind, to the utmost\r\nlimit of her poor abilities, would not be selected for exclusion from your\r\nconfidence. They seek, in fact, by some false rumor, or ridiculous tale,\r\nwhich you have not the means of investigating yourself, to deprive you of\r\nadvice and support. I charge no one in particular; but some one has done\r\nthis--if they had nothing to fear from frankness, they would not inculcate\r\na want of candor towards one who loves you, as they well know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why the fact is Emily said,\" replied Lady Hastings, \"that could only be\r\nfor a short time, and----\"\r\n\r\n\"Emily!\" cried Mrs. Hazleton with a laugh, \"Emily indeed! Oh, then the\r\nmatter is easily understood--but pray what did Emily say? Dear Emily, she\r\nis a charming girl--rather wayward--rather wilful--not always quite so\r\ncandid to her friends as I could wish; but these are all thoughts which,\r\nwill pass away with more knowledge of the world. She will learn to\r\ndiscriminate between true friends and false ones--to trust and confide\r\nentirely and without hesitation in those who really love her, and not to\r\nrepose her confidence in the dark and mysterious. Now I will undertake to\r\nsay that Emily has thrown out hints and inuendoes, without giving you very\r\nclear and explicit information. She has asked you to wait patiently for a\r\ntime. It is always the dear child's way; but I did not think she would\r\npractice it upon her own mother.\"\r\n\r\nNow most people would have imagined, as Lady Hastings did imagine, that\r\nMrs. Hazleton's words proceeded from spite--mere spite; but such was not\r\nthe case: it was all art. She sought to pique Lady Hastings, knowing very\r\nwell that when once heated or angry, she lost all caution; and her great\r\nobject at that moment was to ascertain what Emily knew, and what Emily had\r\nsaid. She was successful to a certain degree. She did pique Lady Hastings,\r\nwho replied at once, and somewhat sharply, though with the ordinary forms\r\nof courtesy. \"I do not think you altogether do Emily justice, dear Mrs.\r\nHazleton, although you have in some degree divined the course she has\r\npursued. She did not exactly throw out inuendoes; but she made bold and\r\ndistinct charges, and though she did not proceed to the proofs, because\r\nthere was no time to do so, and also because there were particular reasons\r\nfor not doing so, yet she promised within a very few hours to establish\r\nevery assertion that she made beyond the possibility of doubt.\r\n\r\n\"I thought so,\" said Mrs. Hazleton, in a somewhat abstracted tone, casting\r\nher eyes round the room and taking up, apparently unconcerned, the vial of\r\nmedicine which stood by Lady Hastings' bedside. \"Pray, my dear friend, when\r\nthe revelation is made--if it ever be made--inform me of the particulars.\"\r\n\r\n\"If it ever be made,\" exclaimed Lady Hastings. \"No revelation needs to be\r\nmade, Mrs. Hazleton--nothing is wanting but the proofs. Emily was explicit\r\nenough as to the facts. She said that you had aided and assisted in\r\ndepriving my husband of his property, that in that and many other\r\nparticulars you had acted any thing but a friendly part, that you were\r\nmoved by a spirit of hatred against us all, and that very seldom had there\r\nbeen any communications between our house and yours without some evil\r\nfollowing it--which is true enough.\"\r\n\r\nShe spoke with a good deal of vehemence, and raised herself somewhat on her\r\nelbow, as if to utter her words more freely. In the mean while Mrs.\r\nHazleton sat silent and calm--as far as the exterior went at least--with\r\nher eyes fixed upon a particular spot in the quilt from which they never\r\nmoved till Lady Hastings had done.\r\n\r\n\"Grave charges,\" she said at length, \"very grave charges to bring against\r\none whom she has known from her infancy, and for whom she has professed\r\nsome regard--but no less false than grave, my dear friend. Now either one\r\nof two things has happened: the first, which I mention merely as a\r\npossibility, but without at all believing that such is the case--the first\r\nis, I say, that Emily, judging your opposition to her proposed unequal\r\nmarriage to be abetted by myself, has devised these charges out of her own\r\nhead, in order to withdraw your confidence from me and gain her own\r\nobjects: the second is--and this is much more likely--that she has been\r\ninformed by some one, either maliciously or mistakenly, of some suspicions\r\nand doubts such as are always more or less current in a country place, and\r\nhas perhaps embellished them a little in their transmission to you.--The\r\nlatter is certainly the most probable.--I suppose she did not tell you from\r\nwhom she received the information.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not exactly,\" answered Lady Hastings, \"but one thing I know, which is,\r\nthat Mr. Dixwell the rector has all the same information, and if I\r\nunderstood her rightly, has got it down in writing.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Hazleton's cheek grew a shade paler; but she answered at once \"I am\r\nglad to hear that; for now we come to something definite. All these charges\r\nmust be substantiated, dear friend--that is, if they can be\r\nsubstantiated--\" she added with a smile.\r\n\r\n\"You can easily understand that, attached to you by the bonds of a long\r\nfriendship, I cannot suffer my name to be traduced, or my conduct\r\nimpeached, even by your own daughter, without insisting upon a full\r\nexplanation, and clear, satisfactory proofs, or a recantation of the\r\ncharges. Emily must establish what she has said, if she can.--I am in no\r\nhaste about it; it maybe to-morrow, or the next day, or the day\r\nafter--whenever it suits you and her in short; but it must be done.\r\nConscious that I am innocent of such great offences, I can wait patiently;\r\nand I do not think, my dear friend, that although I see you have been a\r\nlittle startled by these strange tales, you will give any credence to them\r\nin your heart till they are proved. Dear Emily is evidently very much in\r\nlove with Mr. Marlow, and is anxious to remove all opposition to her\r\nmarriage with him. But I think she must take some other means; for these\r\nwill certainly break down beneath her.\"\r\n\r\nShe spoke so calmly, and in so quiet and gentle a tone--her whole look and\r\nmanner as so tranquilly confident--that lady Hastings could hardly believe\r\nthat she was in any degree guilty.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I cannot tell,\" she said, \"how this may turn out, but I do not think\r\nher marriage with Mr. Marlow can have any thing to do with it. I have fully\r\nand entirely resolved to cease all opposition to her union; on which I see\r\nmy daughter's happiness is staked, and I shall certainly immediately\r\nsignify my consent both to Emily and to my husband.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait a little--wait a little\" said Mrs. Hazleton with a significant nod of\r\nthe head. \"I have no mysteries, my dear friend. I have nothing to conceal\r\nor to hold back. You are going, however, to act upon information which is\r\nvery doubtful. I believe that you have been deceived, whoever has told you\r\nthat Mr. Marlow is the heir to the Earl of Launceston, and it is but an act\r\nof friendship on my part to procure you more certain intelligence. You\r\nshall have it I promise you, before four and twenty hours are over, and all\r\nI ask is that you will not commit yourself by giving your consent till that\r\nintelligence has been obtained. You cannot say that you consent if Mr.\r\nMarlow proves to be the heir of that nobleman, but will not consent if such\r\nbe not the case.--That would never do, and therefore your consent would be\r\nirrevocable. But on the other hand there can be no great harm in waiting\r\nfour and twenty hours at the utmost. I have plenty of books of heraldry and\r\ngenealogy, which will soon let me into the facts, and you shall know them\r\nplainly and straightforwardly at once. You can then decide and state your\r\ndecision firmly and calmly, with just reason and upon good grounds.\"\r\n\r\nLady Hastings was silent. She saw that Mrs. Hazleton had detected the\r\nmotives of her sudden change of views, and she did not much like being\r\ndetected. She had fully made up her mind, too, that Marlow was to become\r\nEarl and her daughter Countess of Launceston, and the very thought of such\r\nnot being the result was a sort of half disappointment to her. Now Lady\r\nHastings did not like being disappointed at all, and moreover she had made\r\nup her mind to have a scene of reconciliation, and tenderness, and\r\ngratitude with her husband and her daughter, from which--being of a truly\r\naffectionate disposition--she thought she should derive great pleasure.\r\nThus she hesitated for a moment as to what she should answer, and Mrs.\r\nHazleton, determined not to let the effect of what she had said subside\r\nbefore she had bound her more firmly, added, after waiting a short time for\r\na reply, \"you will promise me, will you not, that you will not distinctly\r\nrecall your injunction, and give your consent to the marriage till you have\r\nseen me again; provided I do not keep you in suspense more than four and\r\ntwenty hours? It is but reasonable too, and just, and you would, I am sure,\r\nrepent bitterly if you were to find afterwards that your consent to this\r\nvery unequal marriage had been obtained by deceit, and that you had been\r\nmade a mere fool of--Really at the very first sight, even if I had not good\r\nreason to believe that this story of the heirship is either a mistake or a\r\nmisrepresentation, it seems so like a stage trick--the cunning plot of some\r\nknavish servant or convenient friend in a drama--that I should be very\r\ndoubtful. Will you not promise me then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, there can be no great harm in waiting that length of time,\" said\r\nLady Hastings. \"I do not mind promising that; but of course you will let me\r\nknow within four and twenty hours.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will,\" replied Mrs. Hazleton firmly; \"earlier if it be possible; but the\r\nfact is, I have some business to settle to-morrow of great importance. My\r\nlawyer, Mr. Shanks--whom I believe to be a great rogue--persuaded me to\r\nlend some money upon security which he pronounced himself to be good. I\r\nknew not what it was for; as we women of course can be no judges of such\r\nthings; but I have just discovered that it was to pay off some debts of\r\nthis young man who calls himself Sir John Hastings. Now I don't know\r\nwhether the papers have been signed, or any thing about it; and I hear that\r\nthe young man himself is absent, no one knows where. It makes me very\r\nuneasy; and I have sent for Shanks to come to me to-morrow morning. It may\r\ntherefore be the middle of the day before I can get here; but I will not\r\ndelay a moment, you may be perfectly sure.\"\r\n\r\nShe had risen as she spoke, and after pressing the hand of Lady Hastings\r\ntenderly in her own, she glided calmly out of the room with her usual\r\ngraceful movement, and entering her carriage with a face as serene as a\r\nsummer sky, ordered the coachman to drive home in a voice that wavered not\r\nin its lightest tone.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIII.\r\n\r\nMrs. Hazelton entered the carriage, I have said, at the end of the last\r\nchapter, without the slightest appearance of agitation or excitement.\r\nAlthough now and then a flush, and now and then a paleness, had spread over\r\nher face during the conversation with Lady Hastings, though her eye had\r\nemitted an occasional flash, and at other times had seemed fixed and\r\nmeaningless, such indications of internal warfare were all banished when\r\nshe left the room, the fair smooth cheek had its natural color, the eye was\r\nas tranquil as that of indifferent old age.\r\n\r\nThe coachman cracked his long whip, before four magnificent large horses\r\nheaved the ponderous vehicle from its resting place, and Mrs. Hazleton sank\r\nback in the carriage and gave herself up to thought--but not to thought\r\nonly. Then all the smothered agitation; then all the strong contending\r\npassions broke forth in fierce and fiery warfare. It is impossible to\r\ndisentangle them and lay them out, as on a map, before the reader's mind.\r\nIt is impossible to say which at first predominated, rage, or fear, or\r\ndisappointment, or the thirst of vengeance. One passion it is true--the one\r\nwhich might be called the master passion of her nature--soon soared\r\ntowering above the rest, like one of those mighty spirits which rise to the\r\ndizzy and dangerous pinnacle of power in the midst of the turbulence and\r\ntempest which accompany great social earthquakes. But at first all was\r\nconfusion.\r\n\r\n\"Never,\" she repeated to herself--\"never!--it shall never be. If I slay her\r\nwith my own hand it shall never be--foiled--frustrated in every thing; and\r\nby this mere empty, moody child, who has been my stumbling block, my enemy,\r\nmy obstruction, in all my paths. No, no, it shall never be!\"\r\n\r\nA new strain of thought seemed to strike her; her head leaned forward; her\r\neyes closed, and her lips quivered.\r\n\r\nThere are many kinds of conscience, and every one has some sort, such as it\r\nis. What I mean is, that there is almost in every heart a voice of warning\r\nand reproof which counsels us to regret certain actions, and which speaks\r\nin different tones to different men. To the worldly--those who are\r\nhabitually of the earth earthly--it holds out the menace of earthly shame\r\nand misfortune and sorrow. It recapitulates the mistakes we have committed,\r\npoints to the evil consequences of evil deeds, shows how the insincerities\r\nand falsehoods of our former course have proved fruitless, and how the\r\ncunning devices, and skilful contrivances, and artful stratagems, have\r\nended in mortification and reproach and contempt; while still the gloomy\r\nprospects of detection and exposure and public contumely and personal\r\npunishment, are held up before our eyes as the grim portrait of the future.\r\n\r\nI need not pause here to show how conscience affects those who, however\r\nguilty, have a higher sense--those who have a cloudy belief in a future\r\nstate--who acknowledge in their own hearts a God of justice--who look to\r\njudgment, and feel that there must be an immortality of weal or woe. Mrs.\r\nHazleton was of the former class. The grave was a barrier to her sight,\r\nbeyond which there was no seeing. She had been brought up for this world,\r\nlived in this world, thought, devised, schemed, plotted for this world. She\r\nnever thought of another world at all. She went to church regularly every\r\nSunday, read the prayers with every appearance of devotion, even listened\r\nto the sermon if the preacher preached well, and went home more practically\r\natheist than many who have professed themselves so.\r\n\r\nWhat were her thoughts, then, now? They were all earthly still. Even\r\nconscience spoke to her in earthly language, as if there were no other\r\nmeans of reaching her heart but that. Its very menaces were all earthly.\r\nShe reviewed her conduct for the last two or three years, and bitterly\r\nreproached herself for several faults she discovered therein--faults of\r\ncontrivance, of design, of execution. She had made mistakes; and for a time\r\nshe gave herself up to bitter repentance for that great crime.\r\n\r\n\"Caught in my own trap,\" she said; \"frustrated by a girl--a child!--ay! and\r\nwith exposure, perhaps punishment, before me. How she triumphs, doubtless,\r\nin that little malignant heart. How she will triumph when she brings\r\nforward her proofs, and overwhelms me with them--if she has them. Oh, yes,\r\nshe has them! She is mighty careful never to say any thing of which she is\r\nnot certain. I have remarked that in her from a child. She has them beyond\r\ndoubt, and now she is sitting anticipating the pleasure of crushing\r\nme--enjoying the retrospect of my frustrated endeavors--thinking how she\r\nand Marlow will laugh together over a whole list of attempts that have\r\nfailed, and purposes that I have not been able to execute. Yes, yes, they\r\nwill laugh loud and gaily, and at the very altar, perhaps, will think with\r\ntriumph that they are filling for me the last drop of scorn and\r\ndisappointment. Never, never, never! It shall never be. That is the only\r\nway, methinks;\" and she fell into dark and silent thought again.\r\n\r\nThe fit lasted some time, and then she spoke again, muttering the words\r\nbetween her teeth as she had previously done. \"They will never marry with a\r\nmother's curse upon their union! Oh, no, no, I know her too well. She will\r\nnot do that. That weak poppet may die before she recalls her\r\nopposition--must die--and then they will live on loving and wretched. But\r\nit must be made as bitter as possible. It must not stop there.\"\r\n\r\nAgain she paused and thought, and then said to herself, \"That drug which\r\nthe Italian monk sold me would do well enough if I did but fully know its\r\neffects. There are things which leave terrible signs behind them--besides\r\nit is old, and may have lost its virtue. I must run no risk of that--and it\r\nmust be speedy as well as sure. I have but four and twenty hours--the time\r\nis very short;\" and relapsing into silence again, she continued in deep and\r\nsilent meditation till the carriage stopped at her own gates.\r\n\r\nMrs. Hazleton sat in the library that night for two or three hours, and\r\nstudied diligently a large folio volume which she had taken down herself.\r\nShe read, and she seemed puzzled. A servant entered to ask some unimportant\r\nquestion, and she waved him away impatiently. Then leaning her head upon\r\nher hand she thought profoundly. She calculated in her own mind what Emily\r\nknew--how much--how intimately, and how she had learned it. Such a thing as\r\nremorse she know not; but she had some fear, though very little--a sort of\r\nshrinking from the commission of acts more daring and terrible than any she\r\nhad yet performed. There was something appalling--there is always something\r\nappalling--in the commission of a great new crime, and the turning back, as\r\nit were, of the mind of Mrs. Hazleton from the search for means to\r\naccomplish a deed determined, in order to calculate the necessity of that\r\ndeed, proceeded from this sort of awe at the next highest step of evil to\r\nthose which she had already committed.\r\n\r\n\"She must know all,\" said Mrs. Hazleton to herself, after having considered\r\nthe matter for some moments deeply. \"And she must have learned it\r\naccurately. I know her caution well. From whom can she have learned it?\"\r\n\r\n\"From that young villain Ayliffe,\" was the prompt reply. \"I was too harsh\r\nwith him, and in his fit of rage he has gone away at once to tell this\r\ngirl--or perhaps that old fool Dixwell. Most likely he has furnished her\r\nwith evidence too, before he fled the country. Without that I could have\r\nset Marlow's discoveries at naught. Yet I doubt his having gone to Dixwell;\r\nhe always despised him. Mean as he was himself, he looked upon him as a\r\nmeaner. He would not go to him to whine and cant over him. He would go to\r\nthe girl herself. Her he always loved, even in the midst of his violence\r\nand his rage. He would go to her or write to her beyond all doubt. She must\r\nbe silenced. But I must deal with another first. Come what will, this\r\nmarriage shall not take place. Besides, she is the most dangerous of the\r\ntwo. The girl might be frightened or awed into secresy, and it will take\r\nlonger time to reach her, but nothing will keep that weak woman's tongue\r\nfrom babbling, and in four and twenty hours her consent will be given to\r\nthis marriage. If I can but contrive it rightly, that at least may be\r\nstopped, and a part of my revenge obtained at all events. It must be so--it\r\nmust be so.\"\r\n\r\nShe turned to the leaves of the book again, but nothing in the contents\r\nseemed to give her satisfaction. \"That will be too long,\" she said, after\r\nhaving read about a third of a page. \"Three or four days to operate! Who\r\ncould wait three or four days when the object is security, tranquility, or\r\nrevenge? Besides the case admits of no delay. Before three or four days all\r\nwill be over.\"\r\n\r\nShe read again, and was discontented with what she read. \"That will leave\r\ntraces,\" she said. \"It must be the Italian's dose, I believe, after all.\r\nThose monks are very skilful men, and perhaps it may not have lost its\r\nefficiency. It is easily tried,\" she exclaimed suddenly, and ascending\r\nquietly to her own dressing-room, she sought out from the drawer of an old\r\ncabinet a small packet of white powder, which she concealed in the palm of\r\nher hand. Then descending to the library again, she sat for a few minutes\r\nin dull, heavy thought, and then rang a hand-bell which stood upon her\r\ntable.\r\n\r\n\"Bring me a small quantity of meat cut fine for the dog,\" she said, as soon\r\nas her servant appeared. \"He seems ill; what has been the matter with him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing, madam,\" said the man, looking under the table where lay a\r\nbeautiful small spaniel sound asleep. \"He has been quite well all day.\"\r\n\r\n\"He has had something like a fit,\" said Mrs. Hazleton.\r\n\r\n\"Dear me, perhaps he is going mad,\" replied the man. \"Had I not better kill\r\nhim?\"\r\n\r\n\"Kill him!\" exclaimed Mrs. Hazleton; \"on no account whatever. Bring me a\r\nsmall plate of meat.\"\r\n\r\nThe man did as he was ordered, and on his return found the dog sitting at\r\nhis mistress's feet, looking up in her face.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, Dorset,\" she said, speaking to the animal in a kindly tone, \"you are\r\nbetter now, are you?\"\r\n\r\nThe man seemed inclined to linger to see whether the dog would eat: but\r\nMrs. Hazleton took the plate from him, and threw the poor beast a small\r\npiece, which he devoured eagerly.\r\n\r\n\"There that will do,\" said Mrs. Hazleton. \"You may leave the room.\"\r\n\r\nWhen she was alone again, she paused for a moment or two, then deliberately\r\nunfolded the packet, and put a very small quantity of the powder it\r\ncontained upon a piece of the meat. This morsel she threw to the poor\r\nanimal, who swallowed it at once, and then she set down the plate upon the\r\nground, which he cleared in a moment. After that Mrs. Hazleton turned to\r\nher reading again, and looked round once at the end of about two minutes.\r\nThe dog had resumed his sleeping attitude, and she read on. Hardly a minute\r\nmore had passed ere the poor brute started up, ran round once or twice, as\r\nif seized with violent convulsions, staggered for an instant to and fro,\r\nand fell over on its side. Mrs. Hazleton rang the bell violently, and two\r\nservants ran in at once. \"He is dying,\" she cried; \"he is dying.\"\r\n\r\n\"Keep out of his way, madam,\" exclaimed one of the men, evidently in great\r\nfear himself, \"there is no knowing what he may do.\"\r\n\r\nThe next instant the poor dog started once more upon his feet, uttered a\r\nloud and terrific yell, and fell dead upon the floor.\r\n\r\n\"Poor thing,\" said Mrs. Hazleton, \"Poor Dorset! He is dead; take him away.\"\r\n\r\nThe two men seemed unwilling to touch him, but when quite satisfied that\r\nthere was no more life left in him, they carried him away, and Mrs.\r\nHazleton remained alone.\r\n\r\n\"Speedy enough,\" said the lady, replacing the large volume on the shelf.\r\n\"We need no distillations and compoundings. This is as efficacious as ever.\r\nNow let me see. I must try and remember the size of the bottle, and the\r\ncolor of the stuff that was in it.\" She thought of these matters for some\r\nminutes, and then retired to rest.\r\n\r\nDid she sleep well or ill that night? God knows. But if she slept well, the\r\nfriends of hell must sometimes have repose.\r\n\r\nThe next morning very early, Mrs. Hazleton walked out. As the reader knows,\r\nshe lived at no great distance from the little town, even by the high-road,\r\nand that was shortened considerably by a path through the park. There was\r\na poor man in the place, an apothecary, who had came down there in the hope\r\nof carrying away some of the practice of good Mr. Short. He had not been\r\nvery successful, and his stock of medicines was not very great: but he had\r\nall that Mrs. Hazleton wanted. Her demands indeed were simple\r\nenough--merely a little logwood, a little saffron, and a little madder.\r\nHaving obtained these she asked to see some vials, and selected one\r\ncontaining somewhat less than half a pint.\r\n\r\nThe good man packed all these up with zealous care, saying that he would\r\nsend them up to the house in a few minutes. Mrs. Hazleton, however, said\r\nshe would carry them herself; but the very idea of the great lady carrying\r\nhome a parcel, even through her own park, shocked the little apothecary\r\nextremely, and he pressed hard to be permitted to send his own boy, till\r\nMrs. Hazleton replied in a rather peremptory tone, \"I always say what I\r\nmean, sir. Be so good as to give me the parcel.\"\r\n\r\nWhen she reached her own house, she ordered her carriage to be at the door\r\nat half past twelve in order to convey her to the dwelling of Sir Philip\r\nHastings. Upon a very nice calculation the drive, commenced at that hour,\r\nwould bring her to the place of her destination shortly after that precise\r\nperiod of the day when Lady Hastings was accustomed to take an hour's\r\nsleep. But Mrs. Hazleton had laid out her plan, and did not thus act by\r\naccident.\r\n\r\nAlmost every lady in those days acted the part of a Lady Bountiful in her\r\nneighborhood, and gave, not alone assistance in food and money to the\r\ncottagers and poor people about her, but medicine and sometimes medical\r\nadvice. Both the latter were very simple indeed; but the preparation of\r\nthese simple medicines entailed the necessity of what was called a\r\nstill-room in each great house. In fact to be a Lady Bountiful, and to have\r\na still-room, were two of the conventionalities of the day, from which no\r\nlady, having more than a very moderate fortune, could then hope to escape.\r\nMrs. Hazleton was in the still-room, then, when her dear friend, who had\r\nalready on one occasion given the death blow to her schemes upon Mr.\r\nMarlow's heart, drove up to the door and asked to see her.\r\n\r\nThe servant replied that his mistress was busy in the still-room, but that\r\nhe would go and call her in a moment.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, dear, no,\" replied the lady, entering the house with an elastic step;\r\n\"I will go and join her there, and surprise her in her charitable works. I\r\nknow the way quite well--you needn't come--you needn't come;\" and on she\r\nwent to the still-room, which she entered without ceremony.\r\n\r\nMrs. Hazleton was, at that moment, in the act of pouring a purpleish sort\r\nof fluid, out of a glass dish with a lip to it, into an apothecary's vial.\r\nShe turned round sharply at the sound of the opening door, thinking that it\r\nwas produced by a servant intruding upon her uncalled. When she saw her\r\nfriend, however, whose indiscreet advice she had neither forgotten nor\r\nforgiven, her face for a moment turned burning red, and then as pale as\r\ndeath; and she had nearly let the glass fall from her hand.\r\n\r\nWhat was said on either part matters very little. Mrs. Hazleton was too\r\nwise to speak as sharply as she felt, and led the way from the still-room\r\nas fast as possible; but her dear friend had in one momentary glance seen\r\nevery thing--the glass bowl, the vial, the fluid, and--more particularly\r\nthan all--Mrs. Hazleton's sudden changes of complexion on her entrance.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIV.\r\n\r\nSir Philip Hastings sat at breakfast with his daughter the morning of the\r\nsame day on which Mrs. Hazleton in the still-room was subjected to her dear\r\nfriend's unpleasant intrusion. He was calmer than he had been since his\r\nreturn; but it was a gloomy, thoughtful sort of calmness--that sort of\r\nsuperficial tranquility which is sometimes displayed under the influence of\r\noverpowering feelings, as the sea, so sailors tell us, is sometimes\r\nactually beaten down by the force of the winds that sweep over it. His brow\r\nwas contracted with a deep frown, but it was by no means varied. It was\r\nstern, fixed, immoveable. To his daughter he spoke not a word, except when\r\nshe bade him good morning, and asked after his health; and then he only\r\nreplied \"Well.\"\r\n\r\nWhen breakfast was nearly over, a servant brought in some letters, and\r\nhanded two to his master and one to Emily. Sir Philip's were soon read; but\r\nEmily's was longer, and she was still perusing it, with apparently much\r\nemotion, when the servant returned to the room. Sir Philip, during the half\r\nhour they had been previously together, had abstained from turning his eyes\r\ntowards her. He had looked at the table cloth, or straight at the wall; but\r\nnow he was gazing at her so intently, with a strange, eager, haggard\r\nexpression of countenance that he did not even notice the entrance of the\r\nservant till the man spoke to him.\r\n\r\n\"Please your worship\" said the servant \"Master Atkinson of the Hill farm,\r\nnear Hartwell, wishes to speak to you on some justice business.\"\r\n\r\nSir Philip started, and murmured between his teeth \"Justice--ay,\r\njustice!--who did you say?\"\r\n\r\nThe man repeated what he had said before, and his master replied, \"shew him\r\nin.\"\r\n\r\nHe then remained for a moment or two with his head leaning on his hand, and\r\nseemingly making an effort to recall his thoughts from some distant point;\r\nand when Mr. Atkinson entered, he spoke to him tranquilly enough.\r\n\r\n\"Pray be seated, Mr. Atkinson,\" he said, \"what is it you want? I have\r\nmeddled little with magisterial affairs lately.\"\r\n\r\n\"I want a warrant, sir,\" replied Mr. Atkinson. \"And against a near neighbor\r\nand relation of yours; so I am sure you are not a man to refuse me\r\njustice.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not if it were my nearest and my dearest,\" replied Sir Philip, in a deep\r\nand hollow tone. \"Who is the person?\"\r\n\r\n\"A young man calling himself Sir John Hastings,\" said Mr. Atkinson. \"We are\r\nafraid of his getting out of the country. He knows he has been found out,\r\nand he is hiding somewhere not very far off; but I and a constable will\r\nfind him.\"\r\n\r\nEmily had lain down her letter by her side, and was listening attentively.\r\nIt was clear she was greatly moved by what she heard. Her face turned white\r\nand red. Her lip quivered as if she would fain have spoken; but she\r\nhesitated and remained silent for a moment. She thought of the unhappy\r\nyoung man lying on his death bed; for she had as yet received no intimation\r\nof his death from Mr. Dixwell, and of his seeing himself seized upon by the\r\nofficers of justice, his last thoughts disturbed, all his anxious strivings\r\nafter penitence, all his communings with his own heart, all his efforts to\r\nprepare for meeting with death, and God, and judgment, scattered by worldly\r\nshame and earthly anguish--she felt for him--she would fain have petitioned\r\nfor him; but she was misunderstood, and, what was worse, she knew it--she\r\nfelt it--she could not speak--she dare not say any thing, though her heart\r\nseemed as if it would break, and her only consolation was that all would be\r\nexplained, that her motives, her conduct, would all be clear and\r\ncomprehended in a very few short hours. She knew, however, that she could\r\nnot bear much more without weeping; for the letter which she had received\r\nfrom Marlow, telling her that he had arrived in London, and would set off\r\nto see her, as soon as some needful business, in the capital had been\r\ntransacted, had agitated her much, and even pleasureable emotions will\r\noften shake the unnervous so as to weaken rather than strengthen us when\r\ncalled upon to contend with others of a different kind.\r\n\r\nShe rose then and left the room with a sad look and wavering step, and Sir\r\nPhilip gazed at her as she passed with a look impossible to describe,\r\nsaying to himself, \"So--is it so?\"\r\n\r\nThe next instant, however, he turned to the farmer, who was a man of a\r\nsuperior class to the ordinary yeomen of that day, saying, \"What is your\r\ncharge, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, plenty of charges, sir,\" replied the man; \"fraud, conspiracy, perjury,\r\nforgery, in regard to all which I am ready to give information on my oath.\"\r\n\r\nSir Philip leaned his head upon his hand, and thought bitterly for two or\r\nthree minutes. Then raising his eyes full to Atkinson's face, he said,\r\n\"Were this young man my own child, were he my son, or were he my brother,\r\nwere he a very dear friend, I should not have the slightest hesitation, Mr.\r\nAtkinson. I would take the information, and grant you a warrant at\r\nonce--nay, I will do so still, if you insist upon it; for it shall never be\r\nsaid that any consideration made me refuse justice. But I would have you\r\nremember that Sir John Hastings is my enemy; that he has, justly or\r\nunjustly, deprived me of fortune and station, and throughout the only\r\ntransactions we have had together, has shown a spirit of malignity against\r\nme which might well make men believe that I must entertain similar feelings\r\ntowards him. To sign a warrant against him, therefore, would be very\r\npainful to me, although I believe him to be capable of the crimes with\r\nwhich you charge him, and know you to be too honest a man to make such an\r\naccusation without a reasonable confidence in its truth. But I would have\r\nyou consider whether it may not bring suspicion upon all your proceedings,\r\nif your very first step therein is to obtain a warrant against this man\r\nfrom his known and open enemy.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what am I to do. Sir Philip?\" asked the farmer. \"I am afraid he will\r\nescape. I know that he is hiding in this very neighborhood, in this very\r\nparish, within half a mile of this house.\"\r\n\r\nA groan burst from the heart of Sir Philip Hastings. He had spoken his\r\nremonstrance clearly, slowly, and deliberately, forcibly bending his\r\nthoughts altogether to the subject before him; but he had been deeply and\r\nterribly moved all the time, and this direct allusion to the hiding place\r\nof John Ayliffe, to the very house which his daughter had visited on the\r\nprevious day, roused all the terrible feelings, the jealous anger, the\r\nindignation, the horror, the contempt which had been stirred up in him, by\r\nwhat he thought her indecent, if not criminal act. It was too much for his\r\nself-command, and that groan burst forth in the struggle against himself.\r\n\r\nHe recovered himself speedily, however, and he replied, \"Apply to Mr.\r\nDixwell: he is a magistrate, and lives hardly a stone's throw from this\r\nhouse. You will lose but little time, save me from great pain, and both you\r\nand me from unjust imputations.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I am not afraid of any imputations,\" said Mr. Atkinson. \"I have\r\npersonally no interest in the matter. You have, Sir, a great interest in\r\nit, and if you would just hear what the case is, you would see that no one\r\nshould look more sharply than you to the matter, in order that no time may\r\nbe lost.\"\r\n\r\n\"I would rather not hear the case at all,\" replied Sir Philip, \"If I have a\r\npersonal interest in it, as you say, it would ill befit me to meddle. Go to\r\nMr. Dixwell, my good friend. Explain the whole to him, and although\r\nperhaps he is not the brightest man that ever lived, yet he is a good man,\r\nand an honest man, who will do justice in this matter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, sir, very well,\" replied the farmer, a little mortified; for to\r\nsay the truth, he had anticipated some little accession of importance from\r\nlending a helping hand to restore Sir Philip Hastings to the rights of\r\nwhich he had been unjustly deprived, and taking his leave he went away,\r\nthinking the worthy baronet the most impracticable man he had ever met with\r\nin his life. \"I always knew that he was crotchety,\" he said to himself,\r\n\"and carried his notions of right and wrong to a desperate great length;\r\nbut I did not know that he went so far as this. I don't believe that if he\r\nsaw a man running away with his own apples, he would stop him without a\r\nwarrant from another justice. Yet he can be severe enough when he is not\r\nconcerned himself, as we all know. He'd hang every poacher in the land for\r\nthat matter, saying, as I have heard him many a time, that it is much worse\r\nto steal any thing that is unprotected, than if it is protected.\"\r\n\r\nWith these thoughts he rode straight away to the house of Mr. Dixwell, but\r\nto his mortification he found that the worthy clergyman was out. \"Can you\r\ntell me where he is?\" he asked of the servant, \"I want him on business of\r\nthe greatest importance.\"\r\n\r\nThe woman hesitated for a moment, but the expression of perplexity and\r\nanxiety on the good farmer's face overcame her scruples, and she replied,\r\n\"I did not exactly hear him say where he was going, but I saw him take the\r\nfoot-path down to Jenny Best's.\"\r\n\r\nAtkinson turned his horse's head at once, and rode along the road till he\r\nreached the cottage. There he fastened his horse to a tree, and went in.\r\nThe outer room was vacant; but through the partition he heard a voice\r\nspeaking in a slow, measured tone, as if in prayer; and after waiting and\r\nhesitating for a moment or two, he struck upon the table with his knuckles\r\nto call attention to his presence.\r\n\r\nThe moment after, the door opened slowly and quietly, and Jenny Best\r\nherself first put out her head, and then came into the room with a curtsy,\r\nclosing the door behind her.\r\n\r\n\"Good day, Jenny,\" said the farmer; \"is Mr. Dixwell here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Master Atkinson,\" replied the good dame; \"he is in there, praying\r\nwith a sick person.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why how is that?\" asked Mr. Atkinson. \"Best is not ill, I hope, nor your\r\nson.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir,\" answered the old woman; \"it is a young man who broke his leg\r\nclose by our door the other day;\" and seeing him about to ask further\r\nquestions, which she might have had difficulty in parrying, she added, \"I\r\nwill call the parson, to you, sir.\"\r\n\r\nThus saying, she retreated again into the inner room, and in a few moments\r\nMr. Dixwell himself appeared.\r\n\r\n\"God day, Atkinson,\" he said; \"you have been absent on a journey, I hear.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, your Reverence,\" replied the farmer, \"and it is in consequence of\r\nthat journey that I come to you now. I want a warrant from you, Mr.\r\nDixwell; and that as quick as possible.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, I cannot give you a warrant here,\" said the clergyman, hesitating. \"I\r\nhave no clerk with me, nor any forms of warrants, and I cannot very well go\r\nhome just now. It can do no harm waiting an hour or two, I suppose.\"\r\n\r\n\"It may do a great deal of harm,\" replied the farmer, \"for as great a rogue\r\nand as bad a fellow as ever lived may escape from justice if it is not\r\ngranted immediately.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can't you go to Mr. Hastings?\" said the clergyman. \"He would give you one\r\ndirectly, if the case justifies it.\"\r\n\r\n\"He sent me to your Reverence,\" replied the farmer. \"In one word, the case\r\nis this, Mr. Dixwell. I have to charge a man, whom, I suppose, I must call\r\na gentleman, upon oath, with fraud, perjury, and forgery. Shanks, one of\r\nthe conspirators we have got already. But this man--this fellow who calls\r\nhimself Sir John Hastings, I mean, is hiding away here--in this very\r\ncottage, sir, I am told--and may make his escape at any minute. Now that I\r\nam here, and a magistrate with me, I tell you fairly, sir, I will not quit\r\nthe place till I have him in custody.\"\r\n\r\nHe spoke in a very sharp and decided tone; for to say the truth he had a\r\nvague suspicion that Mr. Dixwell, whose good-nature was well known, knew\r\nvery well where John Ayliffe was, and might be trying to convert him, with\r\nthe full intention of afterwards aiding him to escape. The clergyman\r\nanswered at once, however, \"he is here, Master Atkinson, but he is very\r\nill, and will soon be in sterner custody than yours.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a good deal of the bull-dog spirit of the English yeoman in the\r\ngood farmer's character, and he replied tartly, \"I don't care for that. He\r\nshall be in my custody first.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Dixwell looked pained and offended. His brow contracted a good deal,\r\nand laying his hand upon the farmer's wrist, he led him towards the door of\r\nthe inner room, saying, \"You are hard and incredulous, sir. But come with\r\nme, and you shall see his state with your own eyes.\"\r\n\r\nThe farmer suffered himself to be led along, and Mr. Dixwell opened the\r\ndoor, and entered the room with a quiet and reverent step. The sunshine was\r\nstreaming through the little window upon the floor, and by its cheerful\r\nlight, contrasting strangely with the gray darkness of the face which lay\r\nupon the bed of death. There was not a sound, but the footfalls of the two\r\npersons who entered; for the old woman had seated herself by the bedside,\r\nand was gazing silently at the face of the sick man.\r\n\r\nAt first, Mr. Atkinson thought that he was dead; and life indeed lingered\r\non with but the very faintest spark. He seemed utterly unconscious; for the\r\neyes even did not move at the sound of the opening door, and the farmer was\r\na good deal shocked at the hardness of his judgment. He was not one,\r\nhowever, to give up his purpose easily, and when Mr. Dixwell said, \"you can\r\nnow see and judge for yourself--is he likely to escape, do you think?\"\r\nAtkinson answered in a low but determined tone, \"No, but I do not think I\r\nought to leave him as long as there is any life in him.\"\r\n\r\n\"You can do as you please,\" said Mr. Dixwell, in a tone of much\r\ndispleasure, \"Only be silent. There is a seat;\" and leaving him, he took\r\nhis place again by the dying man's side.\r\n\r\nThough shocked, and feeling perhaps a little ashamed, Mr. Atkinson, with\r\nthat dogged sort of resolution which I have before spoken of, resisted his\r\nown feelings, and would not give up the field. He thought he was doing his\r\nduty, and that is generally quite sufficient for an Englishman. Nothing\r\ncould move him, so long as breath was in the body of the unhappy young man.\r\nHe remained seated there, perfectly still and silent, as hour after hour\r\nslipped away, with his head bent down, and his arms crossed upon his chest.\r\n\r\nThe approach of death was very slow with John Ayliffe: he lingered long\r\nafter all the powers of the body seemed extinct. Hand or foot he could not\r\nmove--his sunken eyes remained half closed--the hue of death was upon his\r\nface, but yet the chest heaved, the breath came and went, sometimes\r\nrapidly, sometimes very slowly; and for a long time Mr. Dixwell could not\r\ntell whether he was conscious at all or not. At the end of two hours,\r\nhowever, life seemed to make an effort against the great enemy, though it\r\nwas a very feeble one, and intellect had no share in it. He began to mutter\r\na few words from time to time, but they were wild and incoherent, and the\r\nfaint sounds referred to dogs and horses, to wine and money. He seemed to\r\nthink himself talking to his servants, gave orders, and asked questions,\r\nand told them to light a fire, he was so cold. This went on till the shades\r\nof evening began to fall, and then Mr. Short, the surgeon, came in and felt\r\nhis pulse.\r\n\r\n\"It is very strange,\" said the surgeon, \"that this has lasted so long. But\r\nit must be over in a few minutes now. I can hardly feel a pulsation.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Dixwell did not reply, and the surgeon remained gazing on the dying\r\nman's face till it was necessary to ask for a light. Jenny Best brought in\r\na solitary candle, and whether it was the effect of the sudden though\r\nfeeble glare, I cannot tell, John Ayliffe opened his eyes, and said, more\r\ndistinctly than before, \"I am going--I am going--this is death--yes, this\r\nis death! Pray for me, Mr. Dixwell--pray for me--I do repent--yes, I have\r\nhope.\"\r\n\r\nThe jaw quivered a little as he uttered the last words, but at the same\r\nmoment John Best, the good woman's husband, entered the room with a hurried\r\nstep, drew Mr. Short, the surgeon, aside, and whispered something in his\r\near.\r\n\r\n\"Good Heaven!\" exclaimed the surgeon. \"Impossible, Best! Has the man got a\r\nhorse? mine's at the farm.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir, yes!\" replied the man, eagerly. \"He has got a horse; but you had\r\nbetter make haste.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Short dashed out of the room; but before he left it, John Ayliffe was a\r\ncorpse.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLV.\r\n\r\nMrs. Hazleton found the inconvenience of having a dear friend. It was in\r\nvain that she tried to get rid of her visitor. The visitor would not be got\r\nrid of. She was deaf to hints; she paid no attention to any kind of\r\ninuendoes; and she looked so knowing, so full of important secrets, so\r\nquietly mischievous, that Mrs. Hazleton was cowed by that most unnerving of\r\nall things, the consciousness of meditated crime. She could not help\r\nthinking that the fair widow saw into her thoughts and purposes--she could\r\nnot help doubting the impenetrability of the veil behind which hypocrisy\r\nhides the hideous features of unruly passion--she could not help thinking\r\nthat the keen-sighted and astute must perceive some of the movements at\r\nleast of the rude movers of the painted puppets of the face--the smile, the\r\ngay looks, the sparkling eyes, the calm placid brow, the dignified\r\nserenity, which act their part in the glittering scene of the world, too\r\noften worked by the most harsh, foul, and brutal of all the motives of the\r\nhuman heart. But she was irritated too, as well as fearful; and there was a\r\nsort of combat went on between impatience and apprehension. Had she given\r\nway to inclination she would have ordered one of her servants to take the\r\nintruder by the shoulders and put her out of doors; but for more than an\r\nhour after the time she had fixed for setting out, vague fears--however\r\ngroundless and absurd--were sufficiently powerful to restrain her temper.\r\nShe was not of a character, however, to be long cowed by any thing. She had\r\ngreat confidence in herself--in her own resources--in her own conduct and\r\ngood fortune likewise. That confidence might have been a little shaken\r\nindeed by events which had lately occurred; but anger soon rallied it, and\r\nbrought it back to her aid. She asked herself if she were a fool to dread\r\nthat woman--what it was she had discovered--what it was that she could\r\ntestify. She had merely seen her doing what almost every lady did a hundred\r\ntimes in the year in those day--preparing some simples in the still-room;\r\nand gradually as she found that gentle hints proved unsuccessful, she\r\nresumed her natural dignity of demeanor. That again gave way to a chilling\r\nsilence, and then to a somewhat irritable imperiousness, and rising from\r\nher chair, she begged her visitor to excuse her, alledging that she had\r\nbusiness of importance to transact which would occupy her during the whole\r\nday.\r\n\r\nNot one of all the variation of conduct--not one sign, however slight, of\r\nimpatience, doubt, or anger--escaped the keen eye that was fixed upon her.\r\nMrs. Hazleton, under the influence of conscience, did not exactly betray\r\nthe dark secrets of her own heart, but she raised into importance, an act\r\nin itself the most trifling, which would have passed without any notice had\r\nshe not been anxious to conceal it.\r\n\r\nAs soon as her visitor, taking a hint that could not be mistaken, had\r\nquitted the room and the house, with an air of pique and ill-humor, Mrs.\r\nHazleton returned to the still-room and recommenced her operations there;\r\nbut she found her hand shaking and her whole frame agitated.\r\n\r\n\"Am I a fool,\" she asked herself, \"to be thus moved by an empty gossip like\r\nthat? I must conquer this, or I shall be unfit for my task.\"\r\n\r\nShe sat down at a table, leaned her head upon her hand, gazed forth out of\r\nthe little window, forced her mind away from the present, thought of birds\r\nand flowers, and pictures and statues, and of the two sunshiny worlds of\r\nart and nature--of every thing in short but the dark, dark cares of her own\r\npassions. It was a trick she had learned to play with herself--one of those\r\npieces of internal policy by which she had contrived so often and so long,\r\nto rule and master with despotic sway the frequent rebellions of the body\r\nagainst the tyranny of the mind.\r\n\r\nShe had not sat there two minutes, however, ere there was a tap at the\r\ndoor, and she started with a quick and jarring thrill, as if that knock had\r\nbeen a summons of fate. The next instant she looked quickly around,\r\nhowever, and was satisfied that whoever entered could find no cause for\r\nsuspicion. She was there seated quietly at the table. The vial was out of\r\nsight, the fatal powder hidden in the palm of her hand, and she said aloud,\r\n\"Come in.\"\r\n\r\nThe butler entered, bowing profoundly and saying, \"The carriage is at the\r\ndoor, madam, and Wilson has just come back from the house of Mr. Shanks,\r\nbut he could not find him.\"\r\n\r\nThe man hesitated a little as if he wished to add something more, and Mrs.\r\nHazleton replied in a somewhat sharp tone, \"I told you when I sent it away\r\njust now that I would tell you when I was ready. I shall not be so for half\r\nan hour; but let it wait, and do not admit any one. Mr. Shanks must be\r\nfound, and informed that I want to see him early to-morrow, as I shall go\r\nto London on the following day.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sorry to say, madam,\" replied the butler, \"that if the talk of the\r\ntown is true, he will not be able to come. They say he has been apprehended\r\non a charge of perjury and forgery in regard to that business of Sir Philip\r\nHastings, and has been sent off to the county jail.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Hazleton looked certainly a little aghast, and merely saying \"Indeed!\"\r\nshe waved her hand for the man to withdraw.\r\n\r\nShe then sat silent and motionless for at least five minutes. What passed\r\nwithin her I cannot tell; but when she rose, though pale as marble, she was\r\nfirm, calm, and self-possessed as ever. She turned the key in the lock; she\r\ndrew a curtain which covered the lower half of the window, farther across,\r\nso that no eye from without, except the eye of God, could see what she was\r\ndoing there within. She then drew forth the vial from its nook, opened out\r\nthe small packet of powder, and poured part of it into a glass. She seemed\r\nas if she were going to pour the whole, but she paused in doing so, and\r\nfolded up the rest again, saying, \"That must be fully enough; I will keep\r\nthe rest; it may be serviceable, and I can get no more.\"\r\n\r\nShe gazed down upon the ground near her feet with a look of cold, stern,\r\nbut awful resolution, as if there had been an open grave before her; and\r\nthen she placed the packet in her glove, poured a little distilled water\r\ninto the glass, shook it, and held the mixture up to the light. The powder\r\nhad in great part dissolved, but not entirely, and she added a small\r\nquantity more of the distilled water, and poured the whole into the vial,\r\nwhich was already about one-third full of a dark colored liquid.\r\n\r\n\"Now I will go,\" she said, concealing the bottle. But when she reached the\r\ndoor, and had her hand upon the lock, she paused and remained in very deep\r\nthought for an instant, with her brow slightly contracted and her lip\r\nquivering. Heaven knows what she thought of then,--whether it was doubt, or\r\nfear, or pity, or remorse--but she said in a low tone, \"Down, fool! it\r\nshall be done,\" and she passed out of the room.\r\n\r\nShe paused suddenly in the little passage which led to the still-room, by a\r\npair of double doors, into the principal part of the house, perceiving with\r\nsome degree of consternation that she had been unconsciously carrying the\r\nvial with its dark colored contents in her hand, exposed to the view of all\r\nobservers. Her eye ran round the passage with a quick and eager glance; but\r\nthere was no one in sight, and she felt reassured. Even at that moment she\r\ncould smile at her own heedlessness, and she did smile as she placed the\r\nbottle in her pocket, saying to herself, \"How foolish! I must not suffer\r\nsuch fits of absence to come upon me, or I shall spoil all.\"\r\n\r\nShe then walked quietly to her dressing-room, arranged her dress for the\r\nlittle journey before her, and descended again to the hall, where the\r\nservants were waiting for her coming. After she had entered the carriage,\r\nhowever, she again fell into a fit of deep thought, closed her eyes, and\r\nremained as if half asleep for nearly an hour. Perhaps it would be too much\r\nto scrutinize the state or changes of her feelings during that long,\r\npainful lapse of thought. That there was a struggle--a terrible\r\nstruggle--can hardly be doubted--that opportunity was given her for\r\nrepentance, for desistance, between the purpose and the deed, we know; and\r\nthere can be little doubt that the small, still voice--which is ever the\r\nvoice of God--spoke to her from the spirit-depth within, and warned her to\r\nforbear. But she was of an unconquerable nature; nothing could turn her;\r\nnothing could overpower her, when she had once resolved on any act. There\r\nwas no persuasion had effect; no remonstrance was powerful. Reason,\r\nconscience, habit itself, were but dust in the balance in the face of one\r\nof her determinations.\r\n\r\nShe roused herself suddenly from her fit of moody abstraction, when the\r\ncarriage was still more than a mile from the house of Sir Philip Hastings.\r\nShe looked at the watch which hung by her side, and gazed at the sky; and\r\nthen she said to herself, \"That woman's impertinent intrusion was\r\nintolerable. However, I shall get there an hour before the twenty-four\r\nhours have passed, and doubtless she will have kept her word and refrained\r\nfrom speaking till she has seen me; but I am afraid I shall find her woke\r\nup from her mid-day doze, and that may make the matter somewhat difficult.\r\nDifficult! why I have seen jugglers do tricks a thousand times to which\r\nthis is a mere trifle. My sleight of hand will not fail me, I think;\" and\r\nthen she set her mind to work to plan out every step of her proceedings.\r\n\r\nAll was clearly and definitely arranged by the time she arrived at the door\r\nof Sir Philip Hastings' house. Her face was cleared of every cloud, her\r\nwhole demeanor under perfect control. She was the Mrs. Hazleton, the calm,\r\ndignified, graceful Mrs. Hazleton, which the world knew; and when she\r\ndescended from the carriage with a slow but easy step, and spoke to the\r\ncoachman about one of the springs which had creaked and made a noise on the\r\nway, not one of Sir Philip Hastings' servants could have believed that her\r\nmind was occupied with any thing more grave than the idle frivolous\r\nthoughts of an every-day society.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe shrewdest and most successful of politicians has given us the secret of\r\nhis policy in the words, Follow the public so closely that you shall seem\r\nto lead it.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[9] Continued from page 201\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMUSIC.\r\n\r\nWRITTEN FOR THE INTERNATIONAL MONTHLY MAGAZINE\r\n\r\nBY H. W. PARKER.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The singing spheres\r\n    Entranced the very time they measured out;\r\n    And memory drew me back to one sweet year,\r\n    When, born anew to thought and love, the earth\r\n    Was new, and music--fancy's dancing light\r\n    Till then--became a dazzling revelation.\r\n    'Twas in a city, midway from the hymns\r\n    Of Trenton and Niagra. 'Twas an eve\r\n    When a whole nation sighed, as hour by hour,\r\n    The news electric ran that he was dying,\r\n    The Palo Alto hero. Then and there,\r\n    I hear the orchestra that once had winged\r\n    The festal hours when first the hero stood,\r\n    A nation's chief. To me, the hall, the crowd,\r\n    Were not; I watched a window-square of sky\r\n    Deepen from tender blue to night profound;\r\n    And, as it deepened, heard the voice of Time,\r\n    All Time, all joy and sorrow, madness, woe,\r\n    And saw a thousand forms of light and gloom,\r\n    From music born. Distorted faces glared;\r\n    Long lines of star-browed angels circled down,\r\n    And ages dead were summoned back to earth.\r\n    The horn rang out the joy of happy souls;\r\n    The viol screamed and laughed in scorn, and groans\r\n    Rose dread and deep from under gulfs of night.\r\n    The past, the future life of self, of all.\r\n    Before me crowded, wailed, entreated, warned,\r\n    Battled, triumphed, or struggled wildly past,\r\n    A long procession.\r\n                       Good for me the hour\r\n    When music, erst a sylph or monster form,\r\n    Assumed the glory that immortals wear,\r\n    And sang to me the messages of Heaven.\r\n    It nerved me newly for the war of life,\r\n    Of truth, humanity. Now, a naked soul,\r\n    I dwelt within the central court of space--\r\n    No globe immense, but the aye changing point,\r\n    Where centred, hangs the whole creation's weight,\r\n    Light as a snow-flake, on the hand of God.\r\n    The trill of myriad stars, the heavy boom\r\n    Of giant suns that slowly came and went,\r\n    The whistlings, sweet and clear, of lesser orbs,\r\n    And the low thunder of more distant deeps,\r\n    Ever commingling, grew to eloquence\r\n    No earthly brain may bear. The universe\r\n    Had found a voice: the countless souls that fill\r\n    The countless earths, were calling each to each,\r\n    In tones as high as heaven, as deep as hell,\r\n    And many as the many words. I felt\r\n    What is existence, what the vast extent,\r\n    The mystery, and the far result....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COUNT MONTE-LEONE:\r\n\r\nOR, THE SPY IN SOCIETY.[10]\r\n\r\nTRANSLATED FOR THE INTERNATIONAL MONTHLY MAGAZINE FROM THE FRENCH OF H. DE\r\nST. GEORGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. THE DUEL\r\n\r\nIt was a morning of December, but one of those fitful days when, the sun\r\nshining and the sky cloudless, the weather might lead one to suppose it to\r\nbe spring, were the temperature not so cold and sharp, or if the flowers\r\nwould only open, and the sun were as warm as it was bright. The young\r\nMarquise de Maulear sat over her painting, with Scorpione at her feet, when\r\nthe Count Monte-Leone was announced.\r\n\r\n\"Show him in,\" said Aminta.\r\n\r\nThe Count entered. He was very pale, and there was a secret emotion on his\r\ncountenance which Aminta discovered at once.\r\n\r\n\"What is the matter?\" said she; \"why have you come so early to see me? I do\r\nnot reproach you for this; but if you intend by what you do now to stay\r\naway this evening, I object to it. I protest against this, Monsieur.\"\r\n\r\n\"How beautiful you are!\" said Monte-Leone, \"and how I love to hear you thus\r\ncalculate your moments of happiness.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, Monsieur, I am very exacting, I have already told you. I will,\r\nhowever, grant you one hour, especially as time passes so rapidly in your\r\ncompany.\" Then she said, sadly, \"Life is so short!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, very short,\" said the Count; \"especially when the career you promise\r\nme is pleasant--enough so to make one wish it would never end.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should so wish it, but you, perhaps, would think it tedious.\"\r\n\r\n\"It should be eternal,\" said Monte-Leone, \"and eternity itself would not\r\nsuffice for me to prove my tenderness. Besides, my purgatory here has been\r\nlong enough. Have I not suffered all the tortures of hell since the day I\r\nrenounced you? Ah!\" said he, passionately, \"you will never know how I\r\nloved, and how I now love you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes,\" said Aminta, with a smile, \"a heart like yours, I think, can\r\nlove but once. I speak seriously--do you hear, sir? This word means\r\nmuch--so much that I tremble to think of it. You love me, and always will.\r\nI have faith in you.\"\r\n\r\n\"The future,\" said the Count, with an expression of sorrow which he could\r\nnot conquer, \"is your own--at least, if such is God's will, for mine is in\r\nyour hands.\"\r\n\r\n\"What mean you?\" said the Marquise, fearfully, and looking again with\r\nanxiety at the Count. \"What trouble now menaces you? Would you leave Paris\r\nand myself? Well, that is a small affair. The country you dwell in shall be\r\nmy country--the climate you select shall be mine. I will love the climate\r\nyou love, even if it be as sombre and icy as our Italy is warm and\r\nglorious. The true country is where we find happiness.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dear Aminta,\" said the Count, with a delight he could not repress, \"it\r\nwould be terrible to die now.\"\r\n\r\nScorpione drew near the Count, and looked at him with a strange expression.\r\nOne might have fancied that like the idiots of northern lands, who, we are\r\nassured, have a strange prescience of the future, this poor being was\r\nseized on by an unfortunate presentiment.\r\n\r\nThe words she had heard echoed sadly in Aminta's heart. \"My friend,\" said\r\nshe \"for some time I have seen that you suffered. You are no longer happy\r\nin my presence. For pity's sake conceal nothing from me. Something terrible\r\nand unknown exists in your heart. To whom else but me would you confide it?\r\nWho would you permit to share my torments? Who should suffer with you? Tell\r\nme, I beseech you, for doubt is worse even than misery.\"\r\n\r\nThe Count felt his very soul expand as he heard this expression of Aminta's\r\ninterest. He was about to speak to her. Could he, however, reveal to a\r\nyoung and tender woman the fate which menaced him--the duel which as was\r\nsaid was to be merciless? Could he tell her of the prospect of death in the\r\nmidst of his dreams of happiness. All this was barbarous and impossible,\r\nand the Count sought to lull the storm he had excited, to soften her fears,\r\nand to efface her suspicions.\r\n\r\n\"My noble and dear Aminta, no violent and arbitrary power forces me to\r\nleave you. Perhaps, however, I am about to undertake a journey--a long\r\njourney,\" he said, with feelings he sought in vain to repress. \"An\r\nimportant and imperious duty forces me to do so, and you see that I am sad\r\non account of the farewell I am about to bid you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Farewell!\" said Aminta, growing pale; \"a journey, a departure! Wait but a\r\nfew months, and we will go together.\"\r\n\r\nThis thought, so full of love, seemed sad to the Count, and at once he\r\nsaid,\r\n\r\n\"No, no; I must make this journey alone. But,\" said he, \"I will return, and\r\nthenceforth leave you no more. This will be my last separation and\r\nabsence.\" The Count pronounced these words with such earnestness that a\r\nsmile of joy flitted across Aminta's countenance.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said she, \"at least I know what danger menaces. I know now the\r\nsecret of your distress, and the cause of the melancholy which I could not\r\nbefore penetrate. Count,\" continued she, \"you have sometimes seen me brave\r\nand courageous. Judge then of my affection by the tears which I cannot\r\nrepress.\"\r\n\r\nMonte-Leone took the young woman's hand, and covered it with kisses. In the\r\ninterim, leaning against a wall, and with his features contracted by grief,\r\nthe idiot shed tears, because he saw Aminta do so. A servant appeared, and\r\ntold the Count that Taddeo Rovero asked to see him. Monte-Leone looked up,\r\nand glancing at the clock, thought it was one. Aminta stopped him as he was\r\nabout to go. \"Shall I see you again?\" said she.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes,\" said the Count--\"to-night--to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"One word more,\" said she; \"travel has its danger, and now I know you will\r\ntake care of yourself; for henceforth your life does not belong to you\r\nalone. Every day I will pray for you. I should not, however, be an Italian\r\nwoman if my heart had no tender superstition. Yours, my brother has told\r\nme, is not exempt from this feeling. You have one family superstition in\r\nparticular,\" said she. \"This is an heir-loom. Take it again,\" said she, and\r\nshe placed on the Count's finger the ring of Benvenuto, which Monte-Leone\r\nlong before had sent her through Taddeo. \"They tell me it has always\r\nbrought you good fortune. Do not part with it again, for my sake, as I once\r\nreceived it for yours.\"\r\n\r\n\"Aminta,\" said the Count, \"again you restore confidence to me. I expected\r\nto leave you full of love--but you can yet once more make me happy.\"\r\n\r\n\"How so?\" said she.\r\n\r\n\"Let this be our wedding-ring.\"\r\n\r\n\"So be it,\" said Aminta.\r\n\r\n\"Countess di Monte-Leone,\" said the Count, regaining his energy, and\r\nspeaking with a transport of joy. \"We will meet again--I swear we will.\"\r\n\r\nHe left, and the idiot followed the Count. Monte-Leone's brow became\r\nbright. He had made up his mind, and regained his firmness.\r\n\r\nThe countless indistinct voices of nature alone interrupted the silence of\r\nthis solitude, the echoes of which had so often resounded with the cry of\r\ngrief, or the last sighs of a dying man. It was two o'clock when\r\nMonte-Leone and his companions appeared at the _rendezvous_. The place was\r\nas yet solitary, but in the course of a few minutes the distant sound of\r\nwheels reached their ears, and informed them that ere long their\r\nadversaries would be present. The latter, in fact, descended as they had\r\nthemselves done at the round point which led to the ruins, and before many\r\nminutes had passed the two parties had met. Two officers, one of the navy\r\nand the other of the general's regiment, accompanied the Lieutenant. The\r\nCount and the Lieutenant stood aside. The witnesses approached each other.\r\n\"Gentlemen,\" said Von Apsberg, \"the Count Monte-Leone, as well as\r\nourselves, is ignorant what could have given rise to the atrocious insult\r\nyour friend has uttered, the latter having refused to explain it. Perhaps\r\nyou will think it your duty to do so.\"\r\n\r\nThe naval officer said, \"Monsieur, we are sorrow to say, that we know\r\nnothing more of the matter than you do. Lieutenant A---- is one of the most\r\ngallant officers of the royal navy. He has requested us to attend him here\r\nto-day, swearing that his cause was just and honorable, but that he would\r\nunfold its cause only _in articulo mortis_, or in case his adversary fell.\r\nWe have such confidence in our comrade's honor and prudence, that we\r\ndetermined to do as he wished us.\"\r\n\r\n\"You, as well as we, gentlemen,\" said the other second, \"have read the\r\nletter sent by Lieutenant A---- to Count Monte-Leone, and are aware that it\r\nwas placed out of the power of the latter to refuse the challenge, even if\r\nhe thought he had as yet received insufficient provocation.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is enough, Messieurs,\" said Von Apsberg. \"I have made an appeal to\r\nyou, and I see with sorrow that you disagree with me. I have hitherto\r\nconsidered the seconds in a duel as being charged with the soul of their\r\nfriend. Without however pronouncing on the reasons which seem to have\r\ninfluenced Lieutenant A---- in his bearing towards such a man as\r\nMonte-Leone, we agree with you that he has given more than sufficient\r\nprovocation for bloodshed. Let us therefore cut short this conversation,\r\nand proceed. We claim the choice of arms.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" said the officers.\r\n\r\n\"We select pistols,\" said Taddeo, \"and rigorously using all our rights,\r\nclaim the first fire; or that his adversary object by maintaining that he\r\nhas received the first insult.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lieutenant A---- will maintain no such thing,\" said the naval officer.\r\n\r\n\"Then, gentlemen,\" said Von Apsberg, \"we will not hesitate to take\r\nadvantage of the benefit allowed us by the laws of duelling.\"\r\n\r\nThe seconds of A---- consented, and the weapons were loaded. When the terms\r\nwere explained to Monte-Leone he said, \"I wish that in this unfortunate and\r\nmysterious affair the right may be on my side. I insist, therefore, that\r\nthe terms be equal, and that this gentleman and myself fire together, or\r\nwhen we please, advancing from a distance of twenty paces on each side. I\r\ntake particular care, also, to say, not from bravado merely, but because I\r\nthink proper to do so, that I am an extremely good shot.\"\r\n\r\n\"Were I not resolved to kill you,\" said the Lieutenant, \"I would refuse\r\nthis insolent generosity. I think I have such rights over your life, and my\r\nvengeance is of so sacred character, that I accept it without hesitation.\"\r\n\r\nAll then were silent--the ground measured and the pistols loaded. All this\r\npassed beneath a wall of the old monastery of Longchamps. The two enemies\r\nwere placed opposite. The signal was given, and each lifted his arm.\r\nWithout advancing towards his enemy, who walked rapidly towards him, Count\r\nMonte-Leone fired and his ball took effect on the body of the Lieutenant,\r\nwho sank on the ground before him. He did not utter a complaint, did not\r\nclose his eyes, but supporting himself on his elbow he fired on\r\nMonte-Leone. The ball would have struck the Count in the breast had not a\r\nman rushed rapidly as lightning from the thicket, and covering the Count\r\nwith his body, received the ball in his own heart.\r\n\r\nFour persons cried out at once. The seconds rushed towards the victim, who\r\nwas Scorpione. The poor idiot thus died for Aminta, for he rescued one she\r\nloved. When they lifted up the unfortunate lad he was dead. It was\r\nafterwards learned from the people of the house that when he saw Taddeo\r\nwith the pistol case, he had gotten into a hackney coach and followed the\r\nthree friends. He beyond doubt remembered the box which he had seen in the\r\nhands of the Count at the time of the difficulty with the Marquis de\r\nMaulear. He had gone thus to the rendezvous and sprang from his concealment\r\nonly to receive the mortal wound.\r\n\r\nWhile Von Apsberg, Monte-Leone, and Taddeo sought to reanimate Tonio, the\r\nseconds of A---- supported him, and made useless efforts to staunch the\r\nblood which poured from his wound. Von Apsberg being satisfied that\r\nScorpione was dead, offered his services to the Lieutenant. He, however,\r\nhad fainted. Von Apsberg took out his case and cut two long straps of\r\nadhesive plaster for the purpose of healing the wound. He soon saw that his\r\nefforts would be useless. He said the ball is in the pylorus, and that\r\nnoble organ being injured, death, unless a miracle ensue, must supervene.\r\nThe seconds looked on with amazement. Just then the sound of the feet of\r\nseveral horses was heard, one of the officers said, \"It is the forest\r\nkeepers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hurry away,\" said Von Apsberg to Monte-Leone, who yet held the hand of\r\nScorpione and looked at him with great pity. \"Hurry away. They will arrest\r\nyou as the murderer of this man and what then will become of the\r\nassociation?\"\r\n\r\nThe Count yet hesitated, for this sudden flight might seem injurious to his\r\ncharacter. He was unwilling to shake off the responsibility of any act of\r\nhis life.\r\n\r\n\"For Aminta's sake,\" said Taddeo, in a low voice; and the Count, rushing\r\ninto the thicket, disappeared.\r\n\r\nA few minutes passed and they waited for the horsemen, whose uniforms were\r\nseen in the distance. This was idle, for they passed within a few paces of\r\nthe dead body without noticing it.\r\n\r\nAnd another, too, in spite of all Von Apsberg's efforts, was dying. A\r\nconvulsive whistle began to escape from the breast of the Lieutenant, his\r\neyes rolled in his head, and his sight began to grow dim. The blood ceased\r\nto flow, and only a few black drops escaped from time to time. Suddenly the\r\nbody which had become contracted, expanded, and by a last effort the eyes\r\nof the dying man began to expand and glittered strangely.\r\n\r\n\"Listen all,\" said he sharply and distinctly; \"do not loose one word I say.\r\nThese are the last words I shall ever pronounce. May God grant me power to\r\nunmask a traitor and prevent him from making new victims.\" All drew near,\r\nand paid attention to the words of one about to appear before his Creator.\r\nThe respirations of the three auditors were distinct. \"I said that I would\r\nreveal my secret only _in articulo mortis_, or in case my adversary fell, I\r\nwill keep my promise. I did not tell you,\" and he turned with pain towards\r\nhis seconds, \"why I insulted this man who has killed me. The reason was\r\nthat if I had spoken you would not have suffered me to meet him as being\r\nunworthy of the arm of an honest man. I wished to kill him first and unmask\r\nhim afterwards. This brilliant Count Monte-Leone is a miserable hanger-on\r\nof the police. The people call such things _eaves-droppers_, but men of\r\nhigher rank give them another name: Monte-Leone is a SPY IN SOCIETY.\"\r\n\r\n\"Horror! it is a slander,\" said Von Apsberg and Taddeo.\r\n\r\n\"By all that is dearest to me,\" said the Lieutenant, whose voice became\r\nevery moment weaker and weaker, \"by my father's life, by my own soul, this\r\nis true. Monte-Leone denounced the General, and my father himself gave me\r\nevidence of the fact, which is beyond a doubt. He will also satisfy\r\nyou--men do not lie at the hour of death, and I am dying with these words\r\non my lips.\"\r\n\r\nHe closed his eyes and died.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV--THE ANONYMOUS NOTE.\r\n\r\nNothing could describe the stupefaction of the four seconds of the duel at\r\nwhat A----said. Von Apsberg was the first to divest himself of the mute\r\nterror which seemed to have taken possession of all. \"Gentlemen,\" said he,\r\n\"I appeal to your honor. The truth of a dying man's assertions cannot be\r\nsuspected. I am sure he was convinced of the truth of his assertion. This\r\nalone can palliate his statements. M. A---- would have soon recovered from\r\nhis unfortunate impression in relation to the count, and it is a pity that\r\nhe did not sooner impart it to us. We are able to furnish such evidence of\r\nMonte Leone's truth that he would have himself confessed that he was wrong.\r\nWe will see at all risks the unfortunate young man's father and will\r\nattempt to discover the origin of this strange imputation. We will ask one\r\nfavor of you, such as may be between people of honor, to suspend your\r\njudgments in relation to Monte-Leone until we are able to satisfy you this\r\noriginated in some terrible mistake.\"\r\n\r\nThe naval officer then said: \"We have no reason to be hostile to Count\r\nMonte-Leone, and his conduct in relation to the preliminaries of the duel\r\nrather inspire us with respect. We will, then, await your communications\r\nand say nothing of the circumstances.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thank you, sirs--all here has occurred as should between men of honor\r\nand courage. Let us now take care of the victims. Each take care of his own\r\nfriend,\" pointing to the son of the General and to Scorpione.\r\n\r\nA quarter of an hour afterwards there remained only a few drops of dried-up\r\nblood on the withered leaves and on the moss. When Taddeo returned with the\r\nbody of Tonio, Monte-Leone was already with the Marquise. When the latter\r\nsaw him, she thought in obedience to his promise he had come to bid her\r\nadieu. Then the Count told her what had happened, and the circumstances of\r\nScorpione's death. Aminta wept.\r\n\r\nAll the self-denial of the poor lad appeared before her; his torture and\r\nsuffering which began and ended his life. The arrival of Taddeo, therefore,\r\ndistressed her. The Count, however, was there, and she had discovered the\r\ndirection of his pretended voyage. The Count, perhaps, regretted Tonio's\r\ndeath as much as she did, for he had been its involuntary cause and could\r\nnot console himself for it.\r\n\r\nA few hours after, Von Apsberg and Taddeo met at the bedside of the\r\nVicomte, who was yet sick. They told him all the incidents of the duel, and\r\nthey concurred in thinking the statements of the dying Lieutenant most\r\natrocious. They determined not to speak of it to the Count whose anger and\r\nexasperation, they feared at such a statement. As Von Apsberg had said to\r\nthe Lieutenant's seconds, they determined at all hazards to reach the\r\nGeneral's cell, and thus explain the mystery. Three days passed in useless\r\nefforts to induce the authorities to accede to their request. At last the\r\nProcureur du roi relaxed in favor of Doctor Matheus who was introduced into\r\nthe cell of General A---- whom he found completely overcome by the death of\r\nhis son. To this grief, which was intense and terrific, was joined the most\r\nviolent anger against the Count, whom he called the murderer and assassin\r\nof his son. \"Yes,\" said the unfortunate father, \"he is a villain, and\r\ncoward, and has denounced the father and killed the son. What have I done\r\nto this man? why is he so enraged against me? why against mine?\"\r\n\r\n\"General,\" said Von Apsberg, \"I can understand how bitter a despair like\r\nyours must be: it should not, though, make you unjust towards a man of\r\nhonor who was your associate and is ours.\" This was said in a low tone.\r\n\"Count Monte-Leone fought honorably against your son, and but for an\r\nunforseen accident would have been killed by him. Resume, then, your\r\ncoolness. Time is precious, and I beg you to tell me why you have accused\r\nMonte-Leone.\"\r\n\r\n\"Would to God I had kept that terrible secret to myself! would to God my\r\nson had never heard that charge! He would not then have been forced to meet\r\nhim to avenge me; he would have been living now.\"\r\n\r\nThe sobs of the General increased. Von Apsberg suffered his grief to pass\r\naway, and asked, \"Is this note yours, General?\"\r\n\r\n\"What note?\" asked he, and looking through his tears at a piece of paper\r\nwhich the Doctor gave him.\r\n\r\nVon Apsberg whispered almost in his ear. \"This note was given a few days\r\nafter your arrest.\"\r\n\r\nThe General read it, and said: \"Yes, an old servant who accompanied me to\r\nthe prison, and who was afterwards taken away, was my messenger.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you say that you saw in the hands of the Prefect, as the basis of the\r\ncharge against you, the list of the members of your _vente_ signed by you\r\nand given by you to Count Monte-Leone.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said the Doctor, \"repel this error, and do justice to the innocent\r\nname you have aspersed, for the Count gave me that very list, and here it\r\nis.\" The General took the document and looked minutely at the signature. He\r\nthen said, \"This is not the list I gave Monte-Leone. My signature is\r\nforged. Both the list and signatures have been imitated by a forger,\r\nskilfully indeed, but the true list, the one which beyond doubt will take\r\nme to the scaffold, this list, as I say and as my blood will prove, is in\r\nthe hands of the Prefect of police.\"\r\n\r\nVon Apsberg grew pale and leaned against the wall. An icy paleness ran\r\nthrough his veins and a cloud stood before his eyes. He shuddered at this\r\ndistinct statement. The fact was this list must have been taken from his\r\nown papers and imitated in his own room which hitherto he had looked on as\r\ninviolable, or the Count was a traitor, and the General right. The\r\nunfortunate Lieutenant was not mistaken, he had proved all he said, and was\r\ncorrect in all he did. \"General,\" said Von Apsberg, \"for the sake of the\r\nhonor of a man who is dear to me, for the sake of an association the\r\ndominant idea of which you have sustained so nobly and for which you now\r\nsuffer, think well--make an appeal to your memory; let not chagrin lead you\r\nastray, I beg you; by your thirty glorious years of service, I ask you if\r\nthat is not your signature?\"\r\n\r\n\"On my conscience, and by the memory of my son, I vow that list is an\r\nimitation, a copy of mine, and that the original was given to Angles on the\r\nday of my arrest.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a strange and incredible mystery,\" said Von Apsberg, who continued\r\nto repel with horror the idea of treason in Monte Leone. Some enemy must\r\nhave taken this paper from the Count and copied it.\r\n\r\n\"Do not look so far for this traitor. I have pointed him out to you. The\r\nman you call your friend has denounced and betrayed me by means of that\r\nfatal document. I tell you, Doctor, he is a coward, and has betrayed the\r\nfather and son.\" The old soldier wept. They came to tell the Doctor that\r\nthe time allotted for his visit was past. He was about to leave when the\r\nGeneral seized him and said, \"Do prompt justice to that man, _or the day of\r\nCarbonarism is gone_.\" Von Apsberg could not restrain an expression of\r\nterror when he heard these words and saw the look with which they were\r\naccompanied. He clasped the General's hand and followed the turnkey who\r\naccompanied him to the outer gate of the conciergerie....\r\n\r\nTwo days before this scene, MM. Ober and professor C., the two other chiefs\r\nof the central _ventes_, who were yet at liberty, placed in the hands of\r\nCount Monte-Leone their lists certified to as those of General A----,\r\nF----, B----, and the Count de Ch----, had been. Monte-Leone at once took\r\nthose important papers to Matheus, who shut them up with the others in a\r\nsecret drawer of the old bureau, a print of the lock of which we saw Mlle.\r\nCrepineau's lover take. Von Apsberg, when he returned home, found Taddeo\r\nand the Vicompte waiting for him. The latter was much changed, being pale\r\nand weak. He was so anxious, however, to learn the result of the Doctor's\r\nvisit to A---- that he went to his house. Von Apsberg was struck by the\r\nagitation of his friends and the desperation of their countenances. Taddeo\r\nsaid: \"We are betrayed and lost, and Carbonarism in France is dead. Ober\r\nand C---- were last night arrested and taken to prison.\" Von Apsberg sank\r\non his chair without speaking. He then arose and rushed out of the room.\r\n\"What is the matter with him?\" said both Taddeo and the Vicomte. Von\r\nApsberg went to his laboratory, opened the door and then the secretary. He\r\ntook out a mass of papers, and descended again with rapidity. He said to\r\nthe Vicomte, \"you know the signature of Ober, having corresponded with him\r\non business,\" and handed him the letter.\r\n\r\nD'Harcourt took it, and went to the window, the curtains of which he threw\r\naside. He looked carefully at the signature; and then, after a minute\r\nexamination of every letter, said, \"It is forged.\" He then took a letter\r\nfrom his pocket and added, \"I can prove it by this.\" He then laid the\r\nletter which was written by Ober side by side with the roll and said, \"This\r\nis but a coarse imitation.\"\r\n\r\nVon Apsberg beat his breast and exclaimed: \"As you said, my friends,\r\n_Cabonarism is dead in France_, and one of its sons, or rather its chief,\r\nwho should have defended it with his body and mind, with his blood and\r\nlife, has basely slain it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean Monte-Leone?\" asked d'Harcourt and Taddeo.\r\n\r\n\"I mean Monte-Leone,\" and he told all that had passed between the General\r\nand himself.\r\n\r\n\"No!\" said Taddeo. \"I do not and can not think so. I will not. I will not\r\nthink one I have esteemed honorable to a proverb, so debased. No! Count\r\nMonte-Leone is neither a spy nor a traitor. No! he shall be slandered by\r\nnone; not even by you shall such a slander be uttered against a friend,\r\ncountryman, and brother.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why,\" added he, with great vehemence, \"why do you not ask for another\r\nversion than that which condemns him? why may not these lists have been\r\ntaken and copied while in his possession? why may they not have been thus\r\ntreated, so that he gave you but counterfeits when he fancied he gave you\r\noriginals? Indeed,\" said the noble-hearted young man, \"you forget too\r\neasily the qualities of those you love, and are oblivious of years of\r\ncourage consecrated to the cause we sustain, and for which he has periled\r\nhis life. Truly your friendship turns now into hatred and contempt.\"\r\n\r\n\"Taddeo,\" said d'Harcourt, \"We too, suffer--our hearts also repel what our\r\nreason tells us is true. As you do we seek to satisfy ourselves that hate\r\nnot design had produced our ruin. We, like you, are unwilling to think our\r\nfriend a villain; and God grant we may not be mistaken.\"\r\n\r\nVon Apsberg added that his faith in Monte-Leone had been revived by\r\nTaddeo's energetic defence. Every thing must have a cause, a reason, a\r\nmotive. Why then should Monte-Leone betray us.\r\n\r\n\"Well, well, my friends,\" said Taddeo, clasping their hands, \"if you do not\r\nsuspect you are not sure of what you say; you will soon be satisfied, and\r\nin a short time will deplore your unworthy suspicion. But I who repelled it\r\nwill now fathom what it means. Our safety and a brother's honor depend on\r\nour doing so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen,\" said Von Apsberg, \"we should be guilty if we concealed any\r\nlonger from Monte-Leone what we intended. Certainly a determined will is\r\nrequired to enable one to inflict such a blow on him. He alone can enable\r\nus to trace the traitors and criminals. He can give us light--otherwise we\r\nare in darkness.\"\r\n\r\nTaddeo said, \"Ask me to brave death, to risk my liberty for our cause, and\r\nI will not hesitate. Do not, though, ask me to say to a man whom I think\r\nhonorable, 'you are accused of having sold your brothers, of having basely\r\ndenounced their secrets--you are called a traitor and a spy--that I cannot\r\ndo.'\"\r\n\r\nD'Harcourt said, like Taddeo, \"I feel myself incompetent to make this\r\nrevelation. My lips would quiver, and in spite of my efforts, my strength\r\nwould fail when I looked into his lofty brow and frank countenance. On that\r\nbrow fear and shame have never spread a blush.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I will speak,\" said Von Apsberg, \"I love the Count as well as you do,\r\nand accused him just now with deep regret, my heart refuting the imputation\r\nwhich my mouth uttered. I will see him, I will tell him of all, and will in\r\nmy devotion accomplish the most cruel task ever imposed on me.\"\r\n\r\nJust then several blows were struck on the pannel of the book-case through\r\nwhich we have seen S. Pignana enter, and also Signor Salvatori and M.\r\nH----. \"This is some important information from Pignana,\" said Von Apsberg,\r\nand he touched the spring. The panel opened, but behind it was Monte-Leone\r\ninstead of Pignana. All experienced great emotion when they saw him. Von\r\nApsberg was the most agitated, for he was to speak, and had thus the most\r\npainful task to perform.\r\n\r\n\"I am just now come,\" said Monte-Leone, \"but I did not think I should enter\r\nFrederick's house openly. Prudence is now more needed than ever. You have\r\nheard,\" said he, \"of the arrests of the chiefs of the two other central\r\n_ventes?_\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Von Apsberg, \"and we were seeking to discover who is our secret\r\nenemy.\"\r\n\r\n\"This misfortune,\" said the Count, \"is to be attributed rather to our\r\nfriends than our enemies. One piece of indiscretion may have produced all\r\nthis.\"\r\n\r\n\"Imprudence,\" said Matheus, \"in a conspiracy, is a crime. It endangers all\r\nwho participate in it.\"\r\n\r\n\"My friends,\" said the Count, \"our association is menaced from all\r\nquarters. The journals of every day reveal to all Europe the misfortunes of\r\nthe secret societies of Germany and Italy--the sisters of Carbonarism in\r\nFrance. The latter, attacked in the person of the chiefs of our central\r\n_ventes_, mortally wounded by the discouragement of a great number of our\r\nbrothers, has now but one of two alternatives to take.\"\r\n\r\n\"Revolt?\" said Von Apsberg.\r\n\r\n\"Violence?\" said Taddeo.\r\n\r\n\"No, my friend, prudence and inaction.\"\r\n\r\nAll looked at him with surprise, and Von Apsberg felt again the strange\r\nfeeling which the facts we have recounted had produced.\r\n\r\nThe Count resumed. \"What I say, it is evident, astonishes you. Burdened,\r\nthough, with a heavy responsibility by the _ventes_ of Europe, which await,\r\nas a signal for action, only my word, I can give it to this immense secret\r\nassociation, which is beneath the surface of society, only when force and\r\nnumber are aided by opportunity. Opportunity now is wanting; for the uneasy\r\neye of government penetrates our ranks, and the iron hand of despotism\r\ndecimates us. Force and numbers now are paralysed by fear, and I am sorry\r\nto say all our future hope is found in prudence and inactivity.\"\r\n\r\n\"This language is indeed strange in the month of Monte-Leone,\" said\r\nd'Harcourt.\r\n\r\n\"Far different,\" said Taddeo, \"from that you used yesterday.\"\r\n\r\n\"Calm and cold,\" said Von Apsberg, \"when we take into consideration the\r\nstorm which howls around us--the shipwrecks which menace every day our\r\nvessels.\"\r\n\r\n\"Because the heavens are in a blaze--because the tempests howls around us,\r\nI would have you for the time seek a shelter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Once, though,\" said Apsberg, \"you advised us to brave danger, to meet it\r\nface to face, to parry it with arms in our hands, to conquer or to die.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen,\" said the Count with dignity, \"am I called on to rehearse again\r\nthe offensive scene which took place at the abbey de San Paolo? Am I, as\r\none in the supreme _vente_ of Naples, the chief of which I was, an object\r\nof distrust to my brethren? Have I again lost the confidence of my dearest\r\nassociates? If such be the case, if the pledges I have given to our cause\r\nare now valueless, if forgetfulness and ingratitude go together, say so,\r\nplainly and distinctly. I am willing to abandon the office, title, and\r\nrank, you have conceded to me. I will write to all the _ventes_ of Europe\r\nand will henceforth become the most humble but not the least devoted\r\nbrother of the association.\"\r\n\r\nThe suspicions of the three friends at once passed away when they heard\r\nthis energetic and loyal discourse. Von Apsberg gave his hand to the Count.\r\n\"Excuse us,\" said he, \"misfortune embitters even the best men. The\r\nmisfortunes of our brethen, the mysterious enemy who denounces and seems\r\nanxious to effect our ruin, overwhelm and distress us. Look,\" added he,\r\nwith the haste with which men often discharge a painful duty, \"here are the\r\nlists of the six chiefs of the central _ventes_. Are these the papers given\r\nyou by the imprisoned chiefs A----, Ch----, B----, C----, F----, and Ober?\r\nAre these the papers you gave me?\"\r\n\r\n\"They are.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are these their signatures?\" said Von Apsberg.\r\n\r\n\"They are.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are mistaken,\" said d'Harcourt, \"at least in relation to that of Ober,\r\nfor here is his true signature to this letter, written the day previous to\r\nhis arrest. You can yourself see how poor the imitation is.\"\r\n\r\nThe Count grew pale, and the other conspirators watched him as if to read\r\nhis thoughts.\r\n\r\n\"Do you think the other lists also forgeries?\" said the Count.\r\n\r\n\"We do.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" said the Count, \"all is lost.\"\r\n\r\n\"All _is_ lost,\" said Von Apsberg, \"and we wish to ascertain from you who\r\nhad charge of these papers; how is it that they have been copied, and how\r\ncame the originals in the hands of the police?\"\r\n\r\n\"If such be the case,\" said Taddeo, who suffered visibly from this species\r\nof examination.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" said Monte-Leone, who became more and more excited, \"you ask me a\r\nquestion I cannot answer--which God alone can explain. All this is a\r\nmystery beyond my powers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Von Apsberg, growing every moment more nervous, for he saw the\r\napproach of the necessity of this terrible explanation; \"well, in the\r\nabsence of proof, our brethren indulge in conjectures.\" As he spoke, the\r\nwords seemed riveted to his lips, and to break from them with difficulty.\r\n\r\n\"What are those conjectures?\" said Monte-Leone, resuming his _sang-froid;_\r\nfor the idea that there was a suspicion in relation to his honor, was not\r\nwithin the compass of his thought. He began to seek a remedy almost before\r\nhe knew what was the evil which menaced him.\r\n\r\n\"THEY SAY,\" said Von Apsberg, with hesitation, \"that some traitor has\r\ninsinuated himself among us and betrayed us to the secret police--that he\r\nhas sold us to our enemies, and that the arrests of our brothers are the\r\nfruits of his treason.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who is that man?\" said Monte-Leone.\r\n\r\n\"Who is he?\" said Von Apsberg, and his very heart grew cold.\r\n\r\n\"Yes! who? who is he?\" said Monte-Leone.\r\n\r\nVon Apsberg was about to speak; the bolt was about to fall. His two friends\r\nceased almost to breathe, when the door of the room was rung violently.\r\n\r\n\"Who can it be at this hour?\" said d'Harcourt.\r\n\r\n\"I cannot tell,\" said the Doctor, \"I expect no one.\"\r\n\r\nThe bell was rung again.\r\n\r\n\"Some patient, perhaps,\" said Monte-Leone. \"Go at once. A doctor should\r\nalways be prompt to attend such calls.\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" said d'Harcourt, \"what if it be an officer?\"\r\n\r\n\"Then there is an additional reason for answering the bell,\" said\r\nMonte-Leone.\r\n\r\nVon Apsberg left the room, closing the door after him and hurrying into the\r\nanteroom, saw before him Mlle. Celestine Crepineau. The three friends\r\nlistened at the door Von Apsberg had closed, to ascertain who called.\r\n\r\n\"Excuse me, Doctor,\" said Mlle. Crepineau, \"but the matter was so urgent.\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\"\r\n\r\n\"This note, which a very pleasant person, fair as you are, but not so\r\nhandsome, asked me to deliver at once.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" said the Doctor, who took the note and shut the door in\r\nMlle.'s face.\r\n\r\n\"Now that is not polite,\" said she. \"After all, though, he may have been\r\nengaged in some operation when I rang, and he may have been very much\r\nannoyed by the interruption.\"\r\n\r\nVon Apsberg read the letter which had been given him hurriedly and uttered\r\nan exclamation of joy. When he rejoined his friends, he said, \"God has come\r\nto our assistance.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is the matter?\" asked all of them.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing that concerns us,\" said the Doctor, seeking to disguise his\r\ntrouble; \"I have an appointment which is strictly private.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell me, then,\" said Monte-Leone, \"who is accused of having betrayed us.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not know,\" said Von Apsberg, at once changing his tone. \"No one can\r\nsay who he is.\"\r\n\r\nD'Harcourt and Taddeo looked at him with surprise. The Count said, \"I\r\nthought our secret enemy, or the person pointed out as such, was known to\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"He is not,\" said the Doctor, looking significantly at his friends. \"None\r\nknow who he is.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" said Monte-Leone, \"we must seek him out and reach him wherever he\r\nis.\"\r\n\r\n\"If we discover him,\" said Von Apsberg, \"what shall be his fate.\"\r\n\r\n\"Our statutes provide for that case,\" said Monte-Leone; \"he shall share his\r\nvictim's fate. If our brethren die, so shall he.\"\r\n\r\n\"He shall die,\" said the _Carbonari_.\r\n\r\n\"Listen,\" said Monte-Leone, \"the signature of Ober is false, but perhaps it\r\nis the only one which has been counterfeited. We must ascertain whether the\r\nothers are. This point must be cleared up, and I will see to it. Gold and\r\ninfluence will open the dungeons of our friends, and I will see them.\r\nBesides, the papers were not out of my possession. Ah!\" said he, as if he\r\nwere utterly discouraged, \"this is enough to make a man mad. To-morrow I\r\nshall have penetrated it, and then you will see me.\" He went out through\r\nthe secret pannel.\r\n\r\nWhen it had closed, Apsberg arose and repeating his last words, said, \"Yes,\r\nmy friends, to-morrow you shall know all.\" Taking from his bosom the letter\r\nMlle. Crepineau had given him, he read as follows:\r\n\r\n\"TO DOCTOR MATHEUS--If you would ascertain who has denounced your brethren,\r\nthe miserable spy whose reports have ruined them and given to your enemies\r\nthe original rolls, be to-night at 11 o'clock, p. m., at the back door of\r\nthe Prefecture of Police, opening on the _quai des Orfevres_. You will\r\nthere find the person you need. This is the hour of his _rendezvous_. Stand\r\nin the angle of the door, and without being seen, you may recognize the\r\ninformer.\r\n\r\n\"A BROTHER _of the third_ CENTRAL VENTE.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nV.--A TERRIBLE NIGHT.\r\n\r\nThe night of January 5th, 1820, was one of the coldest of the winter. The\r\nsnow fell heavily, and the Seine was covered with large crystallized flakes\r\nwhich, uniting together and lodging on each bank, narrowed the current and\r\ncaused it to flow more rapidly.\r\n\r\nThe steps of the patrols, or of the benighted travellers, were unheard. The\r\nlight of the lamps shone redly but indistinctly amid the snowy cloak which\r\nhung around them. They seemed like eyes of fire in the long solitary\r\nstreets. All was sad and gloomy in this paradise of pleasure and festival.\r\nOne might have fancied a vast white shroud to be extended over a city\r\nwithout souls.\r\n\r\nA man walked rapidly down the port St. Nicholas, before that part of the\r\nold Louvre which had once witnessed such joy, love, crime, and splendor.\r\nHis steps seemed, from their length, to testify great impatience and an\r\nanxiety to reach his destination.\r\n\r\n\"What can they be about?\" said he. \"All is lost if they do not come. The\r\nanonymous note is formal and the terms are precise, \"_Eleven o'clock and\r\nthe quai des Orfevres_.\" This secret enemy, whose name and features we are\r\nabout to know, had only to hasten to the Prefecture of Police to deprive us\r\nof the only means of unmasking a scoundrel. Yet heaven protects us, for\r\njust as I was about to reveal to Monte-Leone the villainy imputed to him,\r\nthis note closed my lips and veiled the indignation my words could not but\r\nhave created in his noble soul.\"\r\n\r\nThe man stopped. The silence of the _quai_ was broken, and he heard the\r\nsound of persons approaching him. Soon two shadows were seen by the light\r\nof the lamps which hung from the walls of the Louvre, and a voice was\r\nheard. \"It is he: it is Matheus. He waits for us in the _chiaro oscuro_ of\r\nthe door.\" This was followed by a short dry cough, produced by the intense\r\ncold of the evening. The speaker was the Vicomte d'Harcourt, scarcely\r\nrecovered from his illness. A few seconds passed and d'Harcourt and Taddeo\r\nstood by the side of Von Apsberg. The three friends had determined not to\r\nconsult Monte-Leone, nor to inform him of what had taken place until they\r\nknew who had denounced them and who was to be punished.\r\n\r\n\"I came hither,\" said Von Apsberg, \"alone, because three men together are\r\ngreater subjects of remark than two; for the same reason two are more\r\nsubject to comment than one; therefore, let us separate, and walking down\r\nthe quai meet at the place appointed.\"\r\n\r\nThe clock of the Hotel de Ville struck eleven, when the three friends met\r\nin rear of the Prefecture of Police. They followed strictly the directions\r\nof the anonymous letter. They discovered the back door and stood in its\r\nshadow, being concealed by an angle in the wall. They waited there.\r\nCarriage after carriage passed, and their hearts beat violently as each\r\napproached. The carriages crossed the _quai_ but did not stop. At about a\r\nquarter after eleven came a carriage driven rapidly, but which relaxed its\r\nspeed as it reached the _quai de Orfevres_; it then paused a few feet only\r\nfrom the angle of the wall where the Carbonari were concealed. The steps\r\nwere let down and the person in the carriage descended and walked rapidly\r\nto the back door of the Prefecture. In spite, though, of his haste, the\r\nCarbonari could not but remark the stature, tournure, cloak, and bearing of\r\nthe stranger. The door was opened. The three friends followed and were able\r\nto hear him say, \"Count Monte-Leone.\"\r\n\r\n\"He--he--\" said they.\r\n\r\n\"The scoundrel!\" said Von Apsberg.\r\n\r\n\"The villain!\" said D'Harcourt.\r\n\r\nTaddeo hurried to the carriage which was on the point of leaving.\r\n\r\n\"All doubt is gone,\" said Taddeo. \"The carriage is his.\"\r\n\r\n\"They are _his_ horses,\" said d'Harcourt.\r\n\r\n\"It is his driver,\" said Von Apsberg. Then speaking to the man who, while\r\nsurrounded by the three men, began to tremble, \"Who is the person who came\r\nin the carriage?\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"My master,\" said the automaton, more dead than alive. \"The Count\r\nMonte-Leone.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whence did your master come hither?\"\r\n\r\n\"How?\" said the driver, who did not understand the question.\r\n\r\n\"I wish to know, did you drive him from his hotel, or some other place?\"\r\n\r\n\"My master was to-night at the Neapolitan embassy. I waited for him in the\r\ncourtyard which was black as a fair on days when there is no reception.\r\nAfter having remained an hour there he got into the carriage and bade me\r\ndrive to the _quai des Orfevres, near the Prefecture of Police_. Here I am,\r\nMonsieur, and so are you. Good night, then.\"\r\n\r\nWhipping up his horses at the risk of driving over two of the young men who\r\nstood at their heads, he went away at a gallop.\r\n\r\nVon Apsberg, d'Harcourt, and Rovero, were all as white as the snow, which\r\nhad again begun to fall with violence, and looked at each other with that\r\nsympathy of a thousand sentiments which might have been expected in persons\r\nso terribly situated as they were. Terror, shame, and despair were all\r\nunited in their glance. Then by one of those sudden and sublime emotions,\r\nthey clasped each other's hands as if to say, that, henceforth they could\r\nrely on no others. Von Apsberg and the Vicomte, were about to speak, when\r\nTaddeo made them wait, and said, \"No complaints, no insults. _If it be he_,\r\ncontempt and death.\" As he spoke the last word his voice quivered.\r\n\r\n\"'_If it be he?_' what doubt can there be?\" said Von Apsberg. \"Have not our\r\neyes seen? Have not our ears heard? Are we not satisfied?\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you not hear the name?\"\r\n\r\n\"May he not have used the name surreptitiously?\"\r\n\r\n\"Was it not his form, dress, and air?\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you see his face?\" asked Taddeo, who was himself struck with the\r\npoverty of his reasons, and contended against his convictions.\r\n\r\n\"But, are not the driver and carriage his?\"\r\n\r\n\"The driver may have been bribed,\" said Taddeo, who, like many others,\r\nbecame enthusiastic in favor of a bad cause. \"I need something more, I must\r\nbe certain, and will be. In two hours I will see you at Matheus's.\" He\r\nentered a hackney-coach and drove away; bidding the coachman go to the\r\nNeapolitan embassy.\r\n\r\n\"I know his plan,\" said Von Apsberg, \"for if Monte-Leone was not at the\r\nembassy, the driver was mistaken, and it was not Monte-Leone we saw.\"\r\n\r\n\"What now shall we do?\" asked the Vicomte, whose cough became more violent,\r\nand more frequent.\r\n\r\n\"Go home,\" said Von Apsberg, \"for both your body and mind suffer. You\r\nremember I am accountable to your father, and to--your sister, for your\r\nhealth.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what will you do?\" said the Vicomte.\r\n\r\n\"I will wait.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where--here? at this door?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; at this door, deserted as it is. I will wait here, for the phantom or\r\nthe reality. I will wait and tear off the hat which covers his brow, and\r\nread with my own eyes the shame there, and thus throw from my soul the\r\nlast remnant of faith in the honor of my friend.\"\r\n\r\n\"But if he resist?\"\r\n\r\n\"So much the better: I will then kill him.\"\r\n\r\n\"And if he kill you?\"\r\n\r\n\"His work will be complete; for, like Judas, he will have slain one he said\r\nhe loved.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will stay,\" said d'Harcourt; and, despite of the entreaties of his\r\nfriend and the orders of his physician, he wrapped himself more closely in\r\nhis cloak, leaned against the wall, and waited. Von Apsberg followed his\r\nexample....\r\n\r\nTaddeo went to the embassy. Few persons had been there during the evening,\r\nbut the rooms were brilliant with light, and contrasted with the darkness\r\nof the vast courtyard of which Monte-Leone's driver had spoken. It was\r\nalmost midnight, but like most Italians the Duchess lived as much by night\r\nas day. The hour, too, at which Taddeo came was not unusually late, for at\r\nthis hour he was in the habit of visiting the Duchess. Therefore, she was\r\nnot surprised to see him. She lay negligently on an ottoman in that boudoir\r\nwhere we have already seen her receive Count Monte-Leone. There too she had\r\nprobably received company during the evening, for the chairs were in a kind\r\nof ring around the ottoman. She said:\r\n\r\n\"Ah, Signor Rovero, you are welcome. I have been kept long waiting this\r\nevening for you and for one of your best friends, who expected to find you\r\nhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who, Signora, is that friend?\" asked Taddeo, with deep curiosity.\r\n\r\n\"Can you not guess?\" said the Duchess. \"Whom should we call Pylades' friend\r\nbut Orestes?\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it the Count you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Has he been here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" said La Felina.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" repeated Taddeo, \"you kept him a long time with you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Taddeo,\" said La Felina, \"you are indulging in that villanous habit of\r\njealousy. Ah!\" said she, \"I am learned in that.\" She did not give him time\r\nto reply. \"It is a pity you yet love a poor woman that chagrin and\r\nsuffering overwhelm, and whose heart is now as withered as her face.\"\r\n\r\n\"To me you are what you always were, and what you will ever be,\" said\r\nTaddeo. \"Deign, though, to tell me, I beg you, when did the Count go?\"\r\n\r\n\"The Count, again. Did you come hither to speak of him alone?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not so; but an imperious reason forces me to know when he left the hotel.\"\r\n\r\n\"About an hour ago,\" said the Duchess, looking at Taddeo.\r\n\r\nTaddeo grew pale and his fingers grasped the back of the ottoman\r\nconvulsively. His head fell on his bosom, and his eyes became motionless\r\nand fixed upon the carpet. He was convinced, and in despair. From this\r\ndreary state he was aroused by the pressure of a soft hand.\r\n\r\n\"Taddeo,\" said a voice musical as the song of the angels, \"you suffer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said the young man.\r\n\r\n\"I see you do. Can friendship do nothing to soothe you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing!\"\r\n\r\n\"Thus it is with men,\" said La Felina; \"they think of us in their pleasure\r\nand happiness, but never in their sorrow.\"\r\n\r\nTaddeo looked towards the Duchess, whose features expressed so much\r\nsympathy and devotion that he felt his heart give way, and he was about to\r\ngive vent to his secret--an innate and noble sentiment of generosity\r\nrestrained him. It seemed to him that La Felina might fancy he took a base\r\nrevenge, should he dishonor one she had loved so passionately, and,\r\nperhaps, was yet devoted to.\r\n\r\n\"Signor Rovero,\" said the ambassadress, after a long silence, \"since you\r\nthink me unworthy to share your secret, let us have done with it. Skilful\r\nphysicians lull pains they cannot soothe. Let me then do as they do, and\r\ndivert your mind from such bitter thoughts to present it a more pleasant\r\nprospect--that of your sister's happiness.\"\r\n\r\n\"What say you?\" asked Taddeo, as if he were aroused from a dream.\r\n\r\n\"You understand me certainly--the approaching marriage of your sister with\r\nCount Monte-Leone is everywhere understood to be a fact.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never!\" said Taddeo, losing his _sang-froid_.\r\n\r\nA smile of triumph, which Taddeo did not observe, flitted across La\r\nFelina's face. She said, \"What say you?--do you oppose the union?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is no longer possible, signora,\" said Taddeo, giving way to his\r\nemotion--\"it cannot be. Vice and virtue--the serpent and the dove--heaven\r\nand hell--may be mingled, but not Aminta and Monte-Leone. He is unworthy of\r\nher.\"\r\n\r\n\"Unworthy?\" said La Felina--\"your heroic friend unworthy of her?\"\r\n\r\n\"My friend! I deny him. He was my friend, as Judas was Christ's. For he has\r\nsold his, as the recreant sold our Saviour.\"\r\n\r\n\"Taddeo! is it you who speak thus?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is. I, whose soul has been crushed by his cruel deception--I, whose\r\nholy faith in his truth has perished--I, who must detest him whom I loved\r\nand honored!\" Unable any longer to conceal the odious secret within his\r\nbreast, he opened his bleeding heart to La Felina.\r\n\r\nWhen the Duchess had heard him, she said, \"No, it is\r\nimpossible!--Monte-Leone is not a traitor, a coward, the basest of men.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! you say so; so did I. I repelled the charge with horror; yet I was\r\nforced to yield to reason and evidence.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is evident either that you saw or did not see _him_.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the departure from your hotel,\" said Taddeo, \"coincides so fatally\r\nwith his arrival at the prefecture of police--the very answer of the driver\r\nproves all.\"\r\n\r\n\"All this is presumptive, yet terrible; but if you yield--if your faith in\r\nhis honor is not great enough to triumph over it, do you believe that a\r\ntrue passion, that a deep love, such as he inspires, will also do so?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, signora!\" said Taddeo, with pain, \"you have been generous long enough;\r\nyou have had pity or time long enough to allow me at least to remain in\r\ndoubt about your sentiments. It is cruel to choose such a time as this to\r\nown them.\"\r\n\r\n\"How know you what I feel?\" said La Felina to Taddeo, who was about to go.\r\n\"Think you the profound passion of which you speak can resist indifference\r\nand forgetfulness?--I spoke only of your sister.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it true?\" said the young man, forgetting all in his joy at this\r\nconfession--\"of my sister?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; and her heart will not suffer her to be convinced as easily as you\r\nhave been of the baseness of a man whose name and hand she was about to\r\nreceive. To break the bonds which unite them, to change her love into\r\ncontempt, the Marquise de Manlear will require evidence beyond dispute of a\r\ncrime of which, as yet, you have only suspicions, and which my respect for\r\nMonte-Leone forces me to repudiate.\"\r\n\r\nAs she spoke, the Duchess, who sat on the ottoman yet, reached forth her\r\narm to pick up a paper which lay on the carpet. Taddeo, following her\r\nmotions, picked up the paper and handed it to her.\r\n\r\n\"What is that?\" said she; \"some letter I have dropped or which one of my\r\nvisitors has lost.\"\r\n\r\n\"Count Monte-Leone sat there,\" and she pointed to a particular chair. She\r\nopened it mechanically, but scarcely had she done so than she uttered a cry\r\nof grief. Taddeo hurried to La Felina with a bottle of salts. She had let\r\nthe paper fall, and it met his glance as it lay open. He saw a seal. Moved\r\nby a feeling of curiosity, which he could not repress, and hoping to\r\ndiscover the cause of La Felina's emotion, made confident also by the\r\nauthentic character of the paper, Taddeo took and read it carefully.\r\nScarcely had he done so than his strength gave way and he became pale as\r\ndeath. Sinking back in a chair he was crushed, as it were, by terror. The\r\nDuchess had recovered, and their countenances exhibited to each other the\r\nterrible feelings which filled their minds.\r\n\r\n\"Did you read?\" said La Felina.\r\n\r\n\"I did,\" said Rovero. \"Here it is.\"\r\n\r\n\"I recognize as an _attache_ of the Police Count Monte-Leone, who acts by\r\nmy authority.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is awful,\" said she.\r\n\r\n\"Do you yet doubt?\" said Taddeo, quivering with grief.\r\n\r\n\"What will you do with that paper?\" said La Felina, also trembling.\r\n\r\n\"What people do with a decree which holds a man to public infamy--fasten it\r\nto the scaffold, that all may know who is the wretch society expels from\r\nits bosom. I will nail it to his brow.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no! you will not do so; you will not be hard-hearted and cruel enough\r\nto act thus.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will do my duty,\" said Taddeo, sternly.\r\n\r\n\"And I,\" said Signora de la Palma, taking possession of the paper, \"will\r\nnot suffer you to do so.\" Then, quicker than thought, she crushed the paper\r\nin her hands, and threw it in the fire.\r\n\r\n\"What have you done?\" said Taddeo. \"You have destroyed the irrefragable\r\nproof of his guilt.\"\r\n\r\n\"You read it, that is enough _for you_--it is too much for _him_.\" Then\r\nrushing from the room where she was alone, she said aloud--\"It is enough,\r\ntoo, for me, for now _she will never marry him_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.--THE ACCUSATION.\r\n\r\nWhat had occurred was a sufficient reason for the Duchess not to return to\r\nthe room. Taddeo hurried to Von Apsberg's. D'Harcourt and the Doctor did\r\nnot come until two o'clock. The door they watched did not open, and he they\r\nwere so anxiously waiting for prudently left by some other egress.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said the Doctor to Taddeo, \"was he at the Duchess's?--did he go out\r\nas his driver said?\"\r\n\r\n\"May we yet doubt?\" said D'Harcourt.\r\n\r\nTaddeo was silent, and seemed not even to have heard them. With his head on\r\nhis hands, he sat before a table in the centre of the room. His eyes were\r\nred with tears and watching, and he had written a few lines rapidly; at\r\nlast he said:\r\n\r\n\"Read that, which is my answer.\"\r\n\r\nThey did so, and a painful sigh escaped their breasts.\r\n\r\nHe continued--\"I, who defended, accuse him; I do so because I saw the proof\r\nof his infamy. I know not its object and motive, which confounds my reason;\r\nI cannot, however, doubt it, for I have read the letter, and devote this\r\nman to the hatred and vengeance of the brethren he has betrayed.\" He then\r\ntold all that had passed.\r\n\r\nVon Apsberg took the pen and wrote his name below Taddeo's. D'Harcourt did\r\nthe same. This act, simple as it was, had a lugubrious and solemn\r\ncharacter, for which it was indebted to the physiognomy and emotion of the\r\nthree men whose hearts beat under the same emotion, and who shed tears\r\ntogether. At last it seemed that they had evidence which lighted up their\r\nfuture path of vengeance.\r\n\r\n\"My friends,\" said the Doctor, \"Carbonarism in France is dead. The arrests\r\nof the chiefs of the central ventes tell you plainly enough what fate is\r\nreserved for us. We are free men only because our liberty contributed to\r\nthe plans of our enemies. We cannot dissemble that we are sold and betrayed\r\nby a spy. Our retreats and plans also are revealed, and the dungeon, exile,\r\nor death, is the fate of our brethren and ourselves. I propose to you,\r\ntherefore, no isolated vengeance, but one for all affiliated with us. By\r\nthe terms of our association, a sentence has been passed on the traitor,\r\nand been signed.\" He pointed to the paper to which they had affixed their\r\nnames. \"Who will execute it? The supreme annual _vente_ will assemble in a\r\nfew days at the Masonic lodge of the _Friends of Truth_. The supreme vente\r\nwill decide.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, gentlemen,\" said the Vicomte D'Harcourt, \"my mind and education object\r\nto nocturnal vengeance. I prefer daylight and the sword to obscurity and\r\nthe dagger. His sword is not worthy to be crossed with mine, but better\r\nthus than murder.\"\r\n\r\n\"So be it. But not your sword, but those of all of us will be directed to\r\nhis heart. To-morrow, like three shadowy avengers, we will tell him of his\r\ncrime and punish it.\"\r\n\r\n\"To-morrow be it,\" said D'Harcourt and Taddeo. Then, clasping each other's\r\nhand with a mingled feeling of anger, sorrow, and despair, they separated.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the night after these scenes, Monte-Leone, immersed in\r\nreflection, sat in his hotel. It might be about ten o'clock. The snow,\r\nwhich had been falling since the evening before, intercepted the faint\r\nlight of day, and added to the sadness of the vast room. By means of his\r\nanxious research and skilful investigations, Monte-Leone, since the\r\nprevious evening, had ascertained beyond doubt that the true lists of\r\nmembers of the central _ventes_ were in the hands of the police.\r\nThenceforth all seemed an impenetrable mystery to the Count, which his\r\nintelligence and the fertile resources of his mind could not fathom. \"How\r\nhad originals been replaced by copies?--how had the police obtained the\r\noriginals?\" This impenetrable enigma appeared to the Count as a new\r\nevidence of his evil genius, which had been for a long time apparently\r\ngrowing darker and darker before him, and seemed to hurry him to ruin and\r\ndestruction. The defection of the world had become more and more\r\nsensible--the coldness every day became more marked and decided. The\r\nincredible and brutal challenge of Lieutenant A----, the causeless duel,\r\nand the death he had been forced to inflict on one who, for his father's\r\nsake, he almost loved, appeared before him. The embarrassment which he saw\r\nwith sorrow supervene in the intercourse of his friends with him, caused a\r\nvague torment in his usually energetic and decided mind. The tenderness of\r\nAminta, the esteem and affection of the Prince, opposed these impressions,\r\nbut could not dispel them entirely. The Count was thus disturbed by this\r\noverwhelming trouble and fatigue, produced by painful and distressing\r\nreflection, when Giacomo appeared before him. He entered with such calmness\r\nand silence, that the Count did not perceive his intendent until he stood\r\nat his side, and said:\r\n\r\n\"A person is waiting to speak to your excellency in the cabinet.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am at home for no one.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is bad,\" said Giacomo, \"for I have said you were in, and even bade\r\nthe person wait in the next room. Really I think it was time to do so, for\r\nthe poor woman trembled so she could scarcely stand.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who is she?\" asked the Count.\r\n\r\n\"That I cannot give your excellency; in the first place, because she did\r\nnot tell me her name, and, in the second place, because she wears a veil,\r\nwhich her little hand holds fast. This, too, is always the case: ladies\r\nnever come at this hour to see a bachelor without a veil--this is the\r\nuniform of the sex.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who can it be?\" thought he. The idea occurred to him that it might be the\r\nDuchess. The recollection of La Felina's disinterested kindness pleaded in\r\nher favor. Monte-Leone bade Giacomo show her in. The intendent left and\r\nsoon returned, preceded by a veiled lady of an elegant and distinguished\r\nair. Scarcely had the old man retired, when the visitor lifted up her veil,\r\nand exhibited the features of Aminta. He was rejoiced indeed, and said:\r\n\r\n\"You here--at my house!\" and Monte-Leone fell at her feet. \"I never would\r\nhave dared to ask you to grant me such a favor. I never would have hoped,\r\nyou would concede such.\"\r\n\r\n\"Count,\" said Aminta, trembling as much, as possible, \"I took this step for\r\na reason which is imperious to me. Are we alone?\" said she, looking timidly\r\naround her.\r\n\r\n\"We are alone,\" said the Count. \"Speak to me, and tell me to what I am\r\nindebted for your presence here?\"\r\n\r\n\"To my sorrow and despair,\" said the Marquise.\r\n\r\n\"What then is the matter?\" asked the Count with terror.\r\n\r\n\"I do not know, but some danger menaces us.... The Prince, my second\r\nfather, who, as you know, always treated me as a daughter--who hitherto\r\nalways has received you with such kindness, and has acted so that our\r\nproposed marriage is no longer a secret, came yesterday to see me. His\r\ncountenance expressed the greatest trouble, and his eyes sparkled with\r\nrage. He said, 'My daughter, I am about to grieve you greatly, and you must\r\narm yourself with all your courage and resolution. Your marriage with Count\r\nMonte-Leone is now impossible, and I beg you, in the name of my love of\r\nyou, to abandon him for ever.'\"\r\n\r\n\"What do I hear?\" said Monte-Leone, almost beside himself. \"What does this\r\nmean?--why this change?--whence did he obtain a right thus to ruin and\r\ncrush me?\"\r\n\r\n\"He did not pause there, that is but half of my sacrifice. He said, 'You\r\nmust not again receive Count Monte-Leone's visits. The doors of this house\r\nhenceforth are closed to him.'\"\r\n\r\nMonte-Leone said with vehemence, \"Is it not enough to separate us?--would\r\nhe add insult to cruelty? What is my crime? Of what am I accused? Why was I\r\nworthy of you yesterday, and am so base to-day?\"\r\n\r\n\"My prayers and tears,\" said the Marquise, \"could not induce the Prince to\r\nreveal this strange secret to me. He said, 'The Count has no longer a right\r\nto your hand, for he has deceived us. If he insists again on speaking of\r\nhis passion, say to him, that I know all, and have heard it from one who\r\ncannot lie, and whom it is the duty of every Frenchman to have faith in\r\nnext to God--from the King!'\"\r\n\r\nThe Count stood silent and amazed. It seemed to him that an invisible net\r\nsurrounded him, and that the iron threads perpetually closed around him.\r\nAll grew darker and deeper; the mysteries amid which he walked seemed more\r\nintense, and his reason began to give way beneath the heavy hand which\r\nweighed on his brow. Aminta looked at him with deep distress. The silence\r\nof the Count appeared to acknowledge the Prince's words. He seemed\r\nstupified by an accusation, of the justice of which he was aware. Aminta\r\ntrembled at the idea that she had loved a criminal. He, however, at last\r\nlooked up, and his eyes bore only the expression of deep sadness. He said,\r\n\"Aminta, by all that is most holy, by our own life, I swear that I know not\r\nthe meaning of this. From the language, though, that the Prince has used,\r\nand from the King's name being, I know not why, involved in my affairs, it\r\nis clear that my honor has been doubted by the Prince. This I have hitherto\r\nallowed no one to do. However, one has been found bold enough to do this.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Prince is almost my father,\" said Aminta, timidly.\r\n\r\n\"He is my mortal foe, for he seeks to separate us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Listen,\" continued he, in a more gentle tone, and he sat beside her; \"my\r\nlove is so great, I dread so to bring any cloud across your brow, that\r\nhitherto I have concealed my sufferings.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have been unhappy and I ignorant of it!\"\r\n\r\n\"I am in that terrible condition in which a man feels that his reason is\r\nabout to escape from him. I hear my voice--I see my face, and seek to\r\ndiscover in their expression if there be any symptom of folly or not--I am\r\nnot myself--I am not what I was--I am like the leper in the Bible, for all\r\nflee from me--I am repelled everywhere, as if death and disease followed in\r\nmy train. French society, across which I strode like a king once, now seeks\r\nto make me atone for my fleeting triumph. To public esteem and universal\r\nconsideration have succeeded distrust and coldness. I see hatred and fear\r\nin eyes that once shone with admiration and respect; and, when I look into\r\nmy life, when I examine my most secret acts, I find no cause for this\r\nrepulsion, and can not but ask myself if my fancy be not diseased, and\r\ncalls not up the chimeras which distress me.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no,\" said Aminta, with that womanly pride which always actuated her in\r\nrelation to him she loved, \"your reason and mind are yet the same. Some\r\ndark and odious calumny may perhaps have been circulated to your\r\ndisadvantage.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who will tell me what it is?\" said the Count; \"who will exhibit it to my\r\neyes? who will show me the phantom which robs me of name and fame, and\r\nsecretly immolates my honor?\"\r\n\r\nJust then the bell of the hotel rang. The Count hurried to the door to\r\nexclude any one. He was, however, too late; for rapid steps were heard in\r\nthe anteroom.\r\n\r\n\"Who is it?\" said he to Giacomo.\r\n\r\n\"The three persons to whom these doors are never closed, M. Von Apsberg,\r\nd'Harcourt, and Rovero.\"\r\n\r\nThe Marquise uttered a cry of terror.\r\n\r\n\"They will come hither,\" said he, \"in spite of both Giacomo and myself, and\r\nthis room has no other egress.\"\r\n\r\nThe voices of the Carbonari fell on the ears of the Marquise.\r\n\r\n\"Go in there,\" said Monte-Leone to the Marquise; and he opened an elegant\r\ncloset. \"In a few moments I will dismiss them.\"\r\n\r\nThe young woman did so--and scarcely had the door been closed than the\r\nthree young men entered the room. Their brows were stern and severe, and\r\nbore the impress of their feelings.\r\n\r\n\"What is the matter now?\" asked Monte-Leone.\r\n\r\nNot a sound was heard, but six eyes glared at him with disdain and\r\narrogance. Von Apsberg took a paper from his breast, and without speaking,\r\ngave it to Monte-Leone.\r\n\r\n\"What means this?\" said he. He read----\r\n\r\n\"STATUTES OF FRENCH CABONARISM.\r\n\r\n\"_Article 1._--Whosoever shall denounce or betray his brethren, confesses\r\nthat he deserves death, and sentences himself for the crime at the time of\r\nits commission.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said the Count, looking at his friends, \"I know all that. I signed\r\nthat article as well as you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go on,\" said Taddeo. The Count continued:\r\n\r\n\"We, chiefs of the central ventes, supreme judges of the members of the\r\nassociation, we to whom our brethren have confided the sacred right of life\r\nand death, declare, swear, and affirm, that a base traitor and informer is\r\namong us. Each of us therefore demands on this man the punishment which he\r\nhas made himself liable to, which is death.\"\r\n\r\n\"His name? his name?\" asked Monte-Leone.\r\n\r\n\"His name,\" said Von Apsberg, \"we hesitated to tell you the other day, but\r\ndo so no longer. His name is Count Monte-Leone!\"\r\n\r\nMonte-Leone stood mute at this reply, and cast glances of surprise and\r\nterror on his companions. His blood ran as if it would burst the arteries.\r\nHis eyes became fiery, and the nails of his fingers drew blood from his\r\npalms. He was silent. One might have fancied him the animating spirit of a\r\ncloud charged with thunder. After the reading of the sentence, the silence\r\nwas broken by Von Apsberg, who said:\r\n\r\n\"He who was our chief, who was our dearest friend\"--his voice trembled at\r\nthis sentence--\"should not die like a common Carbonaro. We have therefore\r\nforgotten our aversion to his crime, and offer to risk our lives against\r\nhis in strife.\"\r\n\r\nThe Count let the Doctor conclude, and then said, \"I was right! I saw what\r\nI fancied I did. This is no dream--no hallucination. A man has dared to\r\ncouple my name and the reproach of a denunciator together.\"\r\n\r\n\"There are three who dare, and their names are Rovero, D'Harcourt, and Von\r\nApsberg.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen,\" said he, \"sometimes one is forced to condescend to be\r\naffronted when dealing with people too low to reach their mark. I, however,\r\ncannot condescend to stoop to the gutters where such epithets are gathered\r\nup as you throw on me.\"\r\n\r\n\"These epithets,\" said D'Harcourt, \"are not addressed merely by three men\r\nto Count Monte-Leone. All Paris does so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Public rumor,\" interrupted Von Apsberg, \"accuses you of having betrayed\r\nA----, Ober, B----, and our other friends.\"\r\n\r\n\"Public rumor!\" exclaimed the Count, whose eyes seemed ready to spring from\r\nhis head.\r\n\r\n\"Public rumor says that Count Monte-Leone, ruined and desperate, obtains\r\nthe money he now spends, most disgracefully. He has sold his brethren to\r\nenable him to continue his luxury.\"\r\n\r\nThe Count uttered an exclamation of horror.\r\n\r\n\"Count Monte-Leone, proscribed two months ago in France, owes the right of\r\nremaining in the realm to the fact that he is in communication with the\r\nFrench police, whose agent he is.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you done?\" said Monte-Leone, sarcastically.\r\n\r\n\"Count Monte-Leone has sold the secrets of his brethren in every land, and\r\nfilled the prisons of France, Spain, and Italy, with his victims.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" said Monte-Leone, with a far different accent from what might have\r\nbeen expected from an injured man or discovered criminal, for his tone was\r\nalmost joyous, \"this is the explanation of the obscurity amid which I have\r\nwandered. No, it is impossible! Paris may speak thus, but you do not! You\r\ndo not think me such a being?\"\r\n\r\n\"On our honor we do,\" said the three.\r\n\r\nThe ball which reaches the soldier's heart, the bolt which falls on the\r\ntraveller, have not a more sudden effect than these words on Monte-Leone.\r\n\r\n\"They, too!\" said he, \"they, too!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Von Apsberg, \"we accuse you more distinctly even than the rest\r\nof the world. We have horrible proof.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"General A---- swore on the soul of his son that you betrayed him; and that\r\nhe saw the list he gave you in the hands of the Prefect of Police.\" \"This\r\none you gave me,\" said the Doctor, handing the document to him. \"Here are\r\nthe lists of the five other ventes, all of which are false and counterfeit.\r\nYou alone had these lists, and could give them up.\"\r\n\r\n\"Horrible!\" said Monte-Leone.\r\n\r\n\"A man,\" said D'Harcourt, \"went yesterday, at eleven o'clock at night, into\r\nthe Prefecture of Police. This man got out of a carriage which was your\r\nown. The man gave your name to the keeper of the gate. He did not however\r\nknow that two of his brethren overheard him. Those who overheard him are\r\nnow before you. Will you deny it?\r\n\r\n\"The carriage and name mine?\" said Monte-Leone, beside himself.\r\n\r\n\"Finally,\" said Taddeo, \"I saw the disgraceful brevet you received from the\r\npolice. I saw the name of Monte-Leone linked with the infamous word 'SPY.'\"\r\n\r\nTaddeo had no sooner finished reading this letter than Monte-Leone hurried\r\ntowards a press, and took out pistols, one of which he threw at Taddeo's\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\n\"Take it,\" said he, \"kill me before I shoot you; for I will not survive\r\nthis insult one moment, or live with him who has pronounced it.\"\r\n\r\nAt that moment, a cry was heard in the next room. The door was thrown open,\r\nand the Marquise of Maulear fell between her brother and Count Monte-Leone.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.--DESCENT OF THE POLICE.\r\n\r\nWhen the Marquise de Maulear regained consciousness her attention was\r\ndirected to a woman who knelt before the sofa. This person was the\r\nconfidential female servant of the Count Monte-Leone, who rendered to the\r\nMarquise cares he could not extend himself. Having retired into the next\r\nroom he anxiously waited for an opportunity to see her again. Doctor Von\r\nApsberg having become satisfied that the young woman had merely fainted,\r\nand that there was nothing serious in her condition, joined D'Harcourt in\r\nhis efforts to hurry Taddeo from the hotel; and Monte-Leone's ideas having\r\nbeen suddenly changed by the apparition of the lady, which had effaced all\r\nhis sufferings, scarcely perceived their sudden departure. The Marquise,\r\nwhen she recovered, remembered this terrible scene.\r\n\r\n\"My brother!--Taddeo!--Monte-Leone! where are they? For God's sake hide\r\nnothing from me--take me to them--let me terminate that terrible combat,\r\nthe very idea of which makes me mad.\"\r\n\r\n\"Here is the Count, madame,\" said the woman, pointing to Monte-Leone, who\r\ndrew near.\r\n\r\n\"One word--tell me where my brother is.\"\r\n\r\nCount Monte-Leone bade the servant leave him; and when he was alone with\r\nher, he said bitterly, \"Your brother is gone, madame, with his friends,\r\nafter having overwhelmed me with insults.\"\r\n\r\n\"By your love to me,\" said Aminta, \"falling on her knees, I ask his life.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you did not hear this terrible scene,\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"I did. Every word fell on my heart as if it would crush it. They were,\r\nthough, the results of error and anger. The honor of Monte-Leone is above\r\nsuch imputations.\"\r\n\r\n\"Aminta,\" said the Count, \"they are only the echoes of the world. My fury\r\ncannot reach the thousand mouths which dishonor me. I can speak only\r\nthrough their interpreters. Blood alone can wash out the insults they have\r\nsubjected me to--ask me, then, for my own life, but not for the life of\r\nthose who have thus insulted me.\"\r\n\r\n\"One of them is my brother,--is your friend.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dearest friend,\" said the Count, \"one who knows my very inmost life,\r\nand has had a thousand opportunities to judge me. He was bold enough to\r\nrepeat that odious calumny to me. Ah!\" continued he, with sombre vehemence,\r\n\"that this corrupt world, which knows me not, should have been able thus to\r\nheap suspicion on me! The world has judged me by itself; but Taddeo is the\r\nvery reflection of my own soul. The name of friend seemed too little for\r\nhim. I loved him as I would have loved my mother's son. He was the object\r\nof my second love on earth. Aminta, Taddeo has leagued himself with my\r\nenemies, and came hither to affront me mortally. This is too much for my\r\nheart and physical endurance.\" Count Monte-Leone, who in danger was so\r\nfirm, wept at the idea that his friends had so misconceived him.\r\n\r\n\"My friend,\" said the Marquise, sobbing, and pressing the face of\r\nMonte-Leone to her bosom, \"Taddeo would shed tears of despair and regret\r\ncould he only see how you grieve. Certainly he is wrong to doubt your\r\nhonor, but he will repair his wrongs, and expiate all by repentance. He\r\nwill defend you, will convince and confound your enemies and will again be\r\nyour friend.\"\r\n\r\n\"He has suspected me,\" said Monte-Leone, sadly, \"and cannot be my friend\r\nagain, even if he confessed his injustice on his knees before me. He is\r\nyour brother, though, Aminta, and that imposes a sacrifice on me which my\r\nlove for you alone can inspire. I will either not avenge the insult, or\r\ndemand satisfaction for it from another. God grant that other may kill me,\r\nfor then Taddeo will live without being called on to expiate this outrage.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" said Aminta, \"that misfortune was absent, but now he wishes to die.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Aminta,\" said the Count, \"I wish to die rather than drag out a\r\ndisgraceful life, without the power of effacing from my brow the stigma\r\nplaced there, rather than read suspicion in every eye, rather than see\r\nmyself despised. All parts--all Europe--all the world, perhaps, will repeat\r\nthis awful charge.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not believe it,\" said the young woman; \"I am sure there is no heart\r\non earth more worthy than yours, and that you may challenge the esteem of\r\nall. What I know, though, all others must.----In eight days, Count\r\nMonte-Leone, you must marry me. I _will_ be Countess Monte-Leone.\"\r\n\r\n\"What!\" said the Count, to whom that idea gave a glimpse of heaven amid the\r\nhell around him, \"you Countess Monte-Leone!\"\r\n\r\n\"Who then will dare to say that I married a disgraced man?\"\r\n\r\n\"Aminta,\" said the Count, falling at the feet of the noble-hearted woman,\r\n\"God knows my gratitude is equal to your love, but I cannot marry you. You\r\nknow that I love you, that I would give my life for your hand, but my\r\nfather's name I cannot confer on you, dishonored as it now is. Hear then my\r\noath,\" said the Count. Aminta trembled, but he said, \"I swear by the sacred\r\nsoul of my father, not to accept your hand until my enemies are confounded,\r\nuntil the infernal imposture of which I am the victim be recognized as the\r\nbasest and foulest of calumnies.\"\r\n\r\n\"So be it,\" said Aminta. \"We will not wait long for that day, and my\r\nprayers will appeal to heaven for it. Let Taddeo's life, though, be sacred\r\nto you. I confide him to your love of me....\" \"No,--no,\" said she, seeing\r\nhe was about to reply, and perhaps resist her; \"do not speak, but remember\r\nthat Taddeo is my brother, and that his death will separate us for ever.\"\r\n\r\nA few moments after this scene, a carriage, which was standing at the end\r\nof the _quai_, bore the Marquise rapidly to her hotel. We need not say that\r\nshe was completely overcome by the incidents of the day....\r\n\r\nAt about ten o'clock the next day, the Duke d'Harcourt, was at the\r\nbreakfast table with all his family. The eyes of the old man were suddenly\r\nstruck with the following passage in the _Journal des Debats_, which he was\r\nglancing over. He read it aloud:--\r\n\r\n\"The terrible secret association, on the track of which the police has very\r\nlong been, has been discovered--even its name is known--the whimsical one\r\nof 'Carbonarism!' We are assured that every rank of life has\r\nrepresentatives in this vast affiliation. Even young men of the most noble\r\nfamilies of France have been found on its rolls, and they have been already\r\npointed out to the attention of the government.\"\r\n\r\nThe Viscount d'Harcourt grew visibly pale as he heard his father read, and\r\nMarie called the Duke's attention to the fact. She hurried to his side.\r\n\r\n\"It is nothing,\" said he, \"but a sudden spasm of pain. It will soon pass\r\naway, and in a few minutes I shall be better.\"\r\n\r\nThe Duke d'Harcourt had finished his paper, and looked sternly on his son.\r\nHis glance was like that of the judge on the criminal, a mute appeal to\r\nconscience, which the young man could not be insensible of. \"Rene,\" said\r\nthe Duke, in his most penetrating tone, \"if I did not know that you have\r\novercome the influence of those political chimeras which produced your\r\nexpulsion from Italy, the agitation caused by what you have heard read\r\nwould make me think the cause of those conspirators your own.\" The Count's\r\ntrouble increased. The old noble continued to speak in this tone,\r\nextolling, also, the advantages of a monarchical government, and pointing\r\nout the evils likely to result from the possible realization of the plans\r\nof the Carbonari. He, however, heard the sounds of many feet in the\r\nanteroom of the saloon, where he sat with his children. The secretary of\r\nthe Duke, the brave D'Arbel, an old officer of the army of Conde, who had\r\nemigrated with the Duke, and never left him, appeared at the door. His\r\nfeatures expressed the greatest agitation. He said:--\r\n\r\n\"The Duke does not know what is going on.\"\r\n\r\n\"What _is_ the matter, my dear D'Arbel?\" said the Duke, taking a seat in\r\nthe chair the old man handed to him.\r\n\r\n\"The door of our hotel has been broken open in the King's name, and is now\r\nin possession of the police. The chief has placed all the household under\r\nsurveillance and is about to come hither.\"\r\n\r\n\"What means this?\" said the Duke. \"Why is my house thus invaded?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, my God!\" said Marie, trembling, \"what do these people want?\"\r\n\r\n\"What do they want?\" said the Vicomte, completely beside himself. \"They\r\nwant vengeance on me.\"\r\n\r\n\"To arrest you! For heaven's sake, sir, tell me what you have been doing.\"\r\n\r\n\"What you censured so violently just now. Father, I have sought to overturn\r\na government of which my opinions do not approve. I am now to experience\r\nthe penalty of having failed. In such matters success makes great men, and\r\nfailure criminals.\"\r\n\r\n\"Criminal or not, they shall not take away my son. I will defend him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Brother, brother,\" cried Marie, wildly, and embracing the Vicomte.\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur,\" said D'Arbel, \"a few moments yet remain for you to attempt to\r\nenable the Vicomte to escape.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whither? how?\" said the Duke, who was overcome with terror and distress.\r\n\r\n\"Through the garden. The gate on _la rue_ Baylonne perhaps is yet\r\npracticable.\"\r\n\r\n\"D'Arbel is right,\" said the Duke, \"come, come;\" and he took his son's\r\nhand, and led him to the end of the room where he opened the window\r\nfronting on the portico.\r\n\r\n\"Here,\" said the secretary, \"is a cloak and hat with a broad brim which\r\nwill somewhat conceal the features of the Vicomte.\" He placed his own hat\r\nand cloak on Rene's head and hurried him towards the outer door.\r\n\r\n\"Remain here, my daughter,\" said the Duke to Marie, \"to detain them as long\r\nas possible, and enable us to escape.\"\r\n\r\n\"This way--this way, Duke,\" said the secretary to M. d'Harcourt and his\r\nson. \"The principal alley is too much exposed for us to escape unseen.\" He\r\nled them close to the wall where the foliage was very thick, and thence to\r\nthe gate. The Duke's eyes were so filled with tears, that he stumbled at\r\nevery step, and his son was forced to guide him to the goal of all their\r\nhopes. At last they stood at the gate. The Secretary took a pass-key from\r\nhis pocket, put it in the lock and opened the door. Here, though, were six\r\nofficers of police. The Duke uttered a painful cry, and to keep from\r\nfalling leaned against the wall.\r\n\r\n\"I am your prisoner,\" said D'Harcourt to these men. \"I am the Vicomte.\"\r\n\r\n\"We know you well enough. You have long been pointed out to us, and we have\r\nhad our eyes on you.\"\r\n\r\nThe Duke, when he heard these words, felt as if his heart would break, for\r\na cruel idea occurred to him. His son had long been under surveillance, and\r\nhad also for a long time deceived his father.\r\n\r\n\"Come, then,\" said the Vicomte, \"I am ready to accompany you.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are acting correctly, M. le Vicomte,\" said the agent. \"You submit\r\nwithout difficulty. Let us go, but not in this direction; if you please, we\r\nwill go through the garden to the hotel.\"\r\n\r\n\"And why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because such are our orders. The chief intends to examine your papers and\r\ndraw up the _proces verbal_ in your presence. M. H---- never puts himself\r\nout except on great occasions like this.\"\r\n\r\nWithout replying, the Vicomte took his father's arm, and followed by the\r\nold secretary, and surrounded by the police agents, went to the house. The\r\nDuke, during the whole route, did not speak, but sobbed audibly. From time\r\nto time, he clasped the arm of his son as if he would have retained\r\npossession of him. When they returned home, Marie, who thought her brother\r\nsafe, uttered a cry of terror, and fainted. The Duke hurried to her side\r\nand sent for her women to take care of her. The Vicomte, in the interim,\r\nwas taken to his room by M. H----, to be present at the examination of his\r\npapers. A few minutes after, the door was thrown open, and Count\r\nMonte-Leone entered. Faithful to the promise he had made to the Marquise to\r\nask no explanation from Taddeo of the outrage he had received, he had come\r\nto obtain satisfaction from Rene. The appearance of the police in the\r\nvestibule of the house, the terrified air of the servants, made Monte-Leone\r\napprehend some new disaster. He entered the room without being impeded, for\r\nthe guards had orders to keep persons from going out, not from entering.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, Count,\" said the Duke, when he saw Monte-Leone, \"you are come to share\r\nour trouble. My son is arrested and lost.\"\r\n\r\n\"Arrested?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; as an accomplice in one of those awful plots in which you were\r\nyourself once involved. What sorrow to my house!\"\r\n\r\n\"Where is he now--has he left the hotel?\" asked the Count.\r\n\r\n\"No, sir,\" said the secretary, \"the police is now examining his papers.\"\r\n\r\n\"His papers seized! You were right, sir, in what you said--your son is\r\nlost.\"\r\n\r\nThe Duke, with an activity and vehemence due entirely to the\r\nover-excitement caused by his misfortune, said, \"And how, Monsieur, do you\r\nknow any thing about my son's papers?\"\r\n\r\n\"I know but too well,\" said the Count in despair; \"for I shall doubtless\r\nere long share his fate and captivity, as I have his hopes and\r\nanticipations.\"\r\n\r\n\"Alas!\" said the Duke, \"your antecedents, your exalted opinions, a powerful\r\ninstinct which cannot deceive a father's heart, all tell me that you have\r\nled my son astray. You have ruined him.\"\r\n\r\nBefore the Count could reply, the Vicomte returned, followed by M. H----,\r\nchief of the political police, and his officers.\r\n\r\n\"My father,\" said the Vicomte, \"I was unwilling to leave the hotel without\r\nimploring your pardon for the wrong I have done you.\" He knelt before the\r\nDuke, who could scarcely stand. \"I forgive you, my son, for having thus\r\nwrung from me the only tears I ever shed on your account. They are bitter,\r\nthough, indeed, and cannot but shorten my life.\"\r\n\r\nMarie had recovered, and embraced her brother.\r\n\r\nWhat the Duke said to his son, the tender and touching embrace of the young\r\ngirl, appeared not to be observed by Rene. His glance was fixed, and stern,\r\nand full of horror. His features were discomposed by violent rage, and,\r\npointing to Count Monte-Leone, he exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"Ah! why look for the informer?--there he is. Father, father, that\r\nscoundrel has sold me to the persons who tear me from your arms. There is\r\nthe man whose name henceforth is Judas.\"\r\n\r\nThe Duke and Marie shrank from the Count as from a reptile.\r\n\r\n\"Rene,\" said the Count, \"thank God that my hand has no dagger to reach your\r\nheart for this new insult!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! I believe you. One more crime would have cost you nothing. You would\r\nthen slay the body as you did the soul. A coward is but a coward--a spy is\r\nbut an assassin.\"\r\n\r\n\"A spy!\" said Monte-Leone, rushing towards the Vicomte.\r\n\r\nHe then paused as if he had been seized by a new idea, and, turning towards\r\nthe chief of police, said, pointing to Rene, \"Tell this man that I am not\r\none of your creatures. Tell him that I do not know you. If he needs proof,\r\narrest _me_, for I am far more criminal than he is.\"\r\n\r\n\"We have no orders to arrest Count Monte-Leone,\" said M. H----, with a\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" the Count said, \"if you have no orders, I will give you reason to\r\ndo so. Instead of being an agent of police, I am the head of the secret\r\nassociation you seek after. I am the leader of those who seek to ruin you,\r\nthe soul of the invisible world which conspires against the throne of your\r\nking and hated government. Now, far from avoiding, I call on you to act.\r\nEarn your rewards, and arrest the most implacable enemy of your master--the\r\nchief of Carbonarism--arrest me!\"\r\n\r\nThe Duke, the Vicomte, and the witnesses of this scene, looked with\r\namazement at Monte-Leone, who, as it were, rushed to the block. Rene\r\nd'Harcourt felt something of remorse at what he had said. M. H----, piqued\r\nat the defiance, as it were, cast in his face, said to Monte-Leone,\r\n\"Instead of admitting you guilty of the crimes with which you charge\r\nyourself, we protest against your statement: were you as guilty as you say,\r\nyou would not dare thus to speak. Besides, this bravado is useless. We know\r\nto what your conduct is to be attributed, and that you have pursued a very\r\ndifferent course from what you say. If you suffer, it is because you have\r\nforced me thus publicly to make an explanation.\" The Count was stricken\r\ndown by this overwhelming statement, and by the attempt to establish\r\ncomplicity between himself and the police. His sight, his very thoughts\r\nbecame dim, and his lips, contracted by fury, gave vent only to indistinct\r\nmutterings. Before he recovered his _sang-froid_, before he could repel\r\nthis disgraceful imputation, Rene, in obedience to a signal from M. H----,\r\ndisengaged himself from his sister's arm, and, clasping his father to his\r\nbosom, went from the room. Pausing at the door, he pointed to H----, and\r\nsaid to Monte-Leone, \"the words of this man tear away my last doubt; I\r\nmaintain all I have said. May an old man and young woman's tears, may my\r\nblood rest on your head.\" The Vicomte left. When the old man saw his son\r\ndepart, he went to Monte-Leone, and with a gesture of anger and contempt\r\nsaid to him: \"Away! you have betrayed my son to the executioner; away, you\r\nwill also kill me.\" He then sank in the arms of his servant.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[10] Continued from page 216.\r\n\r\nEntered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1850, by Stringer &\r\nTownsend, in the Clerk's Office of the District Court of the United States\r\nfor the Southern District of New-York.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Fraser's Magazine.\r\n\r\nCHAMOIS HUNTING.\r\n\r\n\r\nI had been staying at Fend (one of the highest inhabited spots in Europe)\r\nfor some days, existing on a light and wholesome regimen of hard-boiled\r\neggs, harder baked rye bread, and corn brandy, exploring the magnificent\r\nscenery round me, and had returned the way I came, to a collection of brown\r\npacking-boxes, by courtesy called a village, which rejoiced in the\r\neuphonious name of Dumpfen, nestling cozily under the grand belt of pines\r\nthat feathered the flanks of the mountains, which rose high and clear\r\nbehind. In front roared, rattled, and grated, a wide glacier torrent, the\r\ncolor of ill-made gruel, and on the opposite side stretched, some quarter\r\nof a mile, a flat plain of gravel and worn boulders, here and there gemmed\r\nwith patches of short sweet turf, till it reached the base of a noble range\r\nof cliffs, which rose gray and steep into the clear blue sky, so lofty,\r\nthat the fringe of world-old pines along their summits could scarcely be\r\ndistinguished.\r\n\r\nOn the narrow patch of turf between the village and the torrent I found--it\r\nbeing a fine Sunday afternoon--much mirth and conviviality. The rifle-butts\r\nwere pitched on the opposite side of the torrent, with a small hut close to\r\nthem to shelter the marker, a fellow of infinite fun, attired in bright\r\nscarlet, and a fantastic cap, who placed marked pegs into the bullet-holes,\r\nand pantomimed with insane gestures of admiration, contempt, astonishment,\r\nor derision, the good or bad success of the marksmen. And splendid\r\nspecimens of men they were--firm, proud, yet courteous and gentle, well\r\ndressed in their handsome and handy costume, strong as lions, which, in\r\nfact, they \"needed to be\" to support the weight of those young eighteen\r\npounders which they called rifles, with brass enough in the stocks to\r\nmanufacture faces for a dynasty of railroad kings. Never did I see finer\r\nfellows. And the women! How lovely are those Tyrolese damsels, with their\r\ndark brown glossy hair braided under the green hat, with a brilliant\r\ncarnation stuck over their left ear in a pretty coquettish fashion, enough\r\nto send an unfortunate bachelor raving. And their complexions! the very\r\nflower in their hair paling, looking dull beside their blooming cheeks; and\r\ntheir clear soft hazel eyes, with such a soul of kindness, gentleness and\r\npurity peeping through them, as one scarcely sees, even in one and another\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe shooting was at last over, the winner crowned with flowers, and, the\r\ntargets borne in triumph before them, the whole party retired to the wooden\r\nhut with a mystic triangle in a circle over the door, to eat, drink, and be\r\nmerry; and very merry we were, albeit the only tipple strongly resembled\r\nvery indifferent red ink, both in taste and color. Talk of the _dura\r\nmessorum ilia!_ what insides those fellows must have had!\r\n\r\nWe were sitting listening to interminable stories of Berg-geister, and\r\nGemsen Koenige, and rifle practice at French live targets, when two herd\r\nlads came in from some of the higher mountain pastures, and reported three\r\nchamois, seen that morning low down on the cliffs.\r\n\r\nHereupon up rose a vast clatter among the yaegers as to the fortunate man\r\nwho was to go after them, for chamois hunting, gentle reader, requires\r\nrather less retinue and greater quiet than pheasant shooting in October.\r\n\r\nThe lot fell upon one Joseph something or another; I never could make out\r\nhis surname, if he had one--which I rather doubt. He was a fine, handsome,\r\njaunty fellow, with \"nut-brown hair\" curling round his open forehead, and a\r\nmoustache for which a guardsman would have given his little finger.\r\n\r\nNow, as it fell out, _I_ also got excited; _I_ too thirsted after chamois'\r\nblood; but how to get it? How could I, small five foot seven, and rather\r\nlight in the build, persuade that Hercules to let me accompany him, unless\r\nhe put me in his pocket, which would have been derogatory? It is true that\r\nI, being light myself, was perfectly convinced that weight was rather an\r\nincumbrance than otherwise in the mountains; but how could I persuade the\r\n\"heavy,\" whose opinions, of course, ran the other way, to agree with me?\r\n\r\nHowever, as the men thinned off, and the place became quieter, I determined\r\nto make the attempt, at least, and commenced the attack by \"standing\"\r\nJoseph a chopine of the aforesaid red ink, and then, fearing the\r\nconsequences, followed it up by an infinity of \"gouttes\" of infamous corn\r\nbrandy, all the while raving about the Tyrol, Andreas Hofer, and the Monk,\r\nand abusing the French, till I quite won his heart; he, innocent soul,\r\nnever imagining the trap I had set for him. At last I glided into chamois\r\nhunting, the darling theme of a Tyroler, making him tell me all sorts of\r\nwild stories, and telling him some in return, (every whit as true, I have\r\nno doubt, as his own,) till at last I boldly demanded to be allowed to\r\naccompany him the next morning.\r\n\r\nJoseph humm'd and ha'ed for some time; but gratitude for the tipple, my\r\nadmiration for Hofer, and, perhaps, the knowledge that I had been over\r\nsome of the stiffest bits of the surrounding ranges _solus_, and had been\r\nafter the gems, though unsuccessfully, before, made him relent, and it was\r\nfinally settled that I should go. He went home to get comfortably steady\r\nfor the next morning, and I laid violent hands on every thing eatable to\r\nstuff into my knapsack; whilst the others, after vainly trying to persuade\r\nme out of my determination, retired, shaking hands with me as if I was\r\nordered for execution at eight precisely the next morning. Whereupon I\r\nvanished into the wooden box, which it is _de regle_ to get into in that\r\npart of the world when one wants to sleep, and slumbered incontinently.\r\n\r\nI had been asleep about five minutes, according to my own computation,\r\nthough, in fact, it was as many hours, when I suddenly awoke to a full\r\nperception of the fact that I was \"in for it.\" Alas, those treacherous\r\nfumes of \"Slibowitz\" no longer deluded me into the idea that I was fully up\r\nto any existing mountain in the known world; that jumping a ten-foot\r\ncrevasse was as easy as taking a hurdle; or that climbing hand over hand up\r\nrocks \"so perpendicular\" that one's nose scraped against their stony\r\nbosoms, was rather safer, if any thing, than taking sparrows' nests from\r\nthe top of a stable ladder! However, the honor of England was at stake. Go\r\nI must. So I resigned myself to the certainty of breaking my only neck, and\r\njumped up, thereby nearly dashing in the roof of my brain-pan against the\r\ntop of my box, adding, most unnecessarily, another headache to the one I\r\nalready possessed--and turned out.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, there was no one awake to see my magnanimity; and it was too\r\ndark to see if there had been; so I groped my way down, with my upper\r\ngarments on my arm. After \"barking\" my shins against stools and trestles,\r\nand being nearly eaten up by a big dog in the dark, I sallied out,\r\npreferring to make my morning ablutions in the clear but cold brunnen that\r\nplashed and sparkled on the little green before the door, to dipping the\r\ntip of my nose and the ends of my fingers into the pie-dish which had been\r\nconsiderately placed for my private use.\r\n\r\nHow intensely beautiful that dawn was! with the pine-woods steeped in the\r\ndeepest purple--here and there a faint, gauzy mist, looking self-luminous,\r\nmarking the course of some mountain brook through the forest. The gray\r\ncliffs stood dark and silent on the opposite side of the stream, and one\r\nfar-off snow-peak, just catching the faint reflected light of dawn, gleamed\r\nghost-like and faint, like some spirit lingering on the forbidden confines\r\nof day.\r\n\r\nHow intense was that silence!--broken only by the harsh rattle of the\r\ntorrent and the occasional faint tinkle of a cow-bell in the distance, or\r\nnow and then by a spirit-like whispering sigh amongst the pines, that\r\nscarcely moved their long arms before the cold breath of the dying night.\r\n\r\nI had finished my toilet, and was just beginning to hug myself in the idea\r\nthat I had escaped, and had a very good excuse to slip into bed again, when\r\nI heard the clang of a pair of iron-soled shoes advancing down the torrent\r\nbed that did duty for a road, and to my unmitigated disgust saw Joseph\r\nlooming through the darkness, like an own brother to the Erl King, a\r\n\"shooting-iron\" under each arm, and a mighty wallet on his back. There was\r\nno escape--I was in for it!\r\n\r\nSetting our faces to the mountains, we entered the pine-forest, and toiled\r\nup and up through the dark, silent trees, turning neither to the right hand\r\nnor to the left, till the day began to break, some three-quarters of an\r\nhour after our start, when we stopped with one accord, _of course_ only to\r\nlook back and see the sunrise, though I doubt if either of us could have\r\nkept up that steady tread-mill pace much longer, with any degree of\r\ncomfort.\r\n\r\nWell, we halted to look, perhaps for the last time, at the valley and the\r\nvillage now far below us. We had got to the height of the cliffs on the\r\nopposite side, and could look over their summits at the tumbled alp-billows\r\nthat tossed their white crests for many a league beyond; the sun steeping\r\nthe snow-peaks in tints of purple, pink, and crimson, and here and there a\r\nrock-peak shone with the brightest silver and the reddest gold,--enough to\r\nsend one \"clean wud\" with their exquisite beauty. Down below in the valley,\r\nthe sun had not yet risen, though man had; the little columns of blue smoke\r\nwreathed gracefully upwards in the calm morning air, and the lowing of the\r\ncows, and the faint tinkle of their bells, as they were being driven to\r\ntheir morning pasture, floated up ever and anon in strangely diminished\r\ntones, that seemed to come from some fairy world far down in the\r\nAlp-caverns.\r\n\r\nHaving rested, we turned our faces again to the mountains, and toiled anew\r\nthrough the pine-forest, now no longer dark and gloomy, but fleckered with\r\ngleams of yellow morning light, and sparkling with a thousand dew-diamonds.\r\n\r\nUp, up! still up! across the little sparkling runlets, tumbling head over\r\nheels in their hurry to see what sort of a world the valley below might\r\nbe;--up! over masses of rock, ankle-deep in rich brown moss, bejewelled\r\nwith strawberries and cowberries, garlanded with raspberries, twisting and\r\nstraggling out of their crevices, covered with rich ripe fruit;--up! over\r\nbits of open turf, green as emeralds, set in pure white gravel, sparkling\r\nlike a thousand diamonds;--up! through tangled masses of fallen pines,\r\ntheir bleaching stumps standing out like the masts of great\r\nwrecks--terrible marks of the course of the avalanche wind!--up! through\r\none short bit more of pine-wood, over the split fir fence, and into the\r\nlittle mountain meadow, smiling in the level sunlight, with its bright\r\nstream tinkling merrily through it, its scattering boulders, and wooden\r\nsennhutt, with the cows and goats clustered round it, standing ready to be\r\nmilked,--one of the latter, by the bye, instantly charges me, and has to be\r\nrepelled by my alpenstock, bayonet fashion,--while all around, the sweet\r\nbreath of the cows mingles deliciously with the aromatic fragrance of the\r\npine forest, and the rich scent of the black orchis and wild thyme.\r\n\r\nSeat yourself on that wooden milking-stool by the door--(beware! it has but\r\none leg, and is \"kittle to guide\")--after a hearty shake of the hand from\r\nthat grey old giant of a herdsman, and enjoy yourself.\r\n\r\n\"Joseph, what's i' the fardel? Turn out your traps, and let us see what\r\n'provaunt' you have got.\" A mighty mass of cold boiled mutton, an infinity\r\nof little drabs of rye-bread, the size of one's hand, and as hard as\r\nflints; and--what is that thou art extracting with such a grin on thy manly\r\ncountenance, as if thou hadst found the best joke in Europe, tied up in the\r\ncorner of the bag?\r\n\r\nA quart bottle of corn-brandy!--I simper, the grey herdsman simpers, and\r\nJoseph simpers most of all, as if he was conscious of having done a\r\nmonstrous clever thing, but was modest. \"Schnaps at six in the\r\nmorning!--hardly correct,\" say I.\r\n\r\nJoseph thinks that it _is_ apt to make one thirsty (it certainly always\r\nappears to have that effect upon him); and the grey herdsman shakes his\r\nhead, and smacks his lips dubiously, as if he were not quite certain, but\r\nwould rather like to try.\r\n\r\n\"Well, just one thimbleful, Joseph, 'just to kill the larvae, ye ken.' Ah!\r\nyou don't understand, it is a mountain excuse, too. Never mind--hand us the\r\nbecher.\"\r\n\r\nHere we breakfasted luxuriously, eking out our store with sour milk and\r\ncrumbly new white cheese from the sennhutt. The grey herdsman eyes me\r\nintently, and longs to know what manner of man I am. I take pity on his\r\nthirst for knowledge. \"Ein Englander?\"--I am his friend for life! He has\r\nheard of the 30,000_l._ sent over in the French war-time, and his nephew\r\nhas seen _the_ letter in a glass-case at Innspruck. \"And I want to shoot\r\nchamois?\" He looks almost sorrowfully at me, but I have gone too far to\r\nretreat, and am very valiant. \"Yes, there are three up about the Wildgrad\r\nKoegle.\" That is enough, Ade Andre! Pack up, Joseph, Forward!\r\n\r\nStop a bit, let us load here; we may stumble on something shootable. I am\r\nsoon ready; but loading with Joseph is a very solemn affair, not to be\r\nundertaken lightly, or finished in a hurry.\r\n\r\nFirst, he takes a dose of stuff out of a cow's horn, which I, in my\r\nignorance, suppose to be very badly made No. 7 shot. A small quantity of\r\nthis he places in the pan of his rifle, and crushes with the handle of his\r\nknife, the rest he pours down the barrel, and I perceive that it is powder;\r\nthen he looks up and down, round and about--what the deuce _is_ he after?\r\nIs he cockney enough to be going to flash off his rifle, and afraid of some\r\none hearing him? No, there he has it--a bunch of grey moss, \"baum haar,\" as\r\nhe calls it, from that blasted pine. Wonder again; what in the name of\r\ngoodness is he going to do with that? Use it as a pocket-handkerchief? I do\r\nnot believe he carries one; at any rate, if he does, he only uses that\r\npattern said by the Fliegende Blaetter to be so popular amongst the\r\nGallician deputies of the Paul's-Kirche Parliament. No,--wrong again; he\r\ncarefully pulls it to pieces, and making it into a round ball, rams it down\r\nupon the powder; and a most excellent dodge it is. Colonel Hawker has only\r\nre-discovered an old secret, or, more likely, learnt it on the shores of\r\nthe Bodensee; then the greased patch and the ball, and all is ready. On we\r\ngo!\r\n\r\nAfter leaving the meadow, we entered again into the pine forest, which\r\ngradually became more open, the trees more stunted and fantastic, and their\r\nlong straggling arms clothed more and more as we ascended with the ash-grey\r\nbaumhaar; dead trees and thunder-riven stumps became frequent, rotting in\r\nand into the black bog mould, which gives a scanty root-hold to the\r\nblushing alpen-rose. Soon we leave the trees behind us altogether; nothing\r\nbut wild chaotic masses of gravel and stones, tossed and heaped one on the\r\nother, by the fierce avalanche--the very rocks grey and crumbling with age;\r\nhere and there patches of black bog, with little oases of emerald green\r\nturf perched in their centre, the black orchis growing thick upon them, and\r\nperfuming the air yards around.\r\n\r\nEre long, even these traces of vegetation became more scarce, and the\r\nappearance of every thing around us wilder and more steril. Still the\r\nbrilliant peaks of the Wildgrad Koegle gleamed brightly before us, and\r\nbeckoned us on.\r\n\r\nOur path lay now, steep and rugged, along the edge of a ravine, at the\r\nbottom of which we heard the torrent chafing and roaring many a yard below\r\nus. There was a precipitous bank of rocks and screes to our right, quite\r\nunclimbable, which seemed only to want the will--they certainly had the\r\nway--to topple us into the abyss. Just as we were turning an abrupt angle\r\nvery gingerly, with our eyes fixed on our slippery path, and longing for an\r\nelephant's trunk, to try the sound bits from the rotten ones, we suddenly\r\nheard a rushing \"sough,\" like the falling of a moist snow avalanche, and a\r\ncloud passed across the sun. Glancing hastily upwards, I--yes I, in the\r\nbody at this present, inditing this faithful description of my chase,--saw,\r\nnot a hundred paces from me, an enormous vulture! Any thing so fiercely, so\r\nterribly grand, as this great bird, saw I never before, and can scarcely\r\nhope to see again. He was so near that we could distinctly see the glare of\r\nhis fierce eye, and the hard bitter grip of his clenched talons. The sweep\r\nof his vast wings was enormous--I dare not guess how broad from tip to tip;\r\nand their rushing noise, as he beat the air in his first labored strokes,\r\nsounded strangely wild and spirit-like in the mountain stillness. A dozen\r\nstrange strokes, and he took a wild swoop round to our right, and away,\r\nlike a cloud before the blast, till a neighboring peak hid him from our\r\nsight, followed by a wild shout of astonishment from Joseph. I opened not\r\nmy mouth, or if I did--left it open.\r\n\r\nNothing ever gave me such a feeling of _reality_ as the sight of this vast\r\nvulture so near me. Often and often had I seen them, both in Switzerland\r\nand the Tyrol, sailing so high that, although well up the mountain flank\r\nmyself, I almost doubted whether they were realities, or mere _muscae\r\nvolitantes_, produced by staring up in to the clear bright sky, with one's\r\nhead thrown back. This fellow there was no doubt of--we saw his very beard!\r\nWe were really then chamois-hunting--we had penetrated into the very den of\r\nthe mountain tyrant. No fear of gigs and green parasols _here;_ we were\r\nabove the world!\r\n\r\nSoon after our friend had departed, and we had recovered from the\r\nastonishment into which his unexpected visit had thrown us, we reached the\r\nend of our _mauvais pas_, and found ourselves at the foot of a wild valley,\r\nentirely shut in by ranges of lofty cliffs, with here and there patches of\r\nsnow lying on the least inclined spots. In front, still far above us,\r\ntowered the wild rock masses of the Wildgrad Koegle. The Koegle itself ran up\r\ninto one sharp peak, that seemed from where we were, to terminate in a\r\npoint. Great part of its base was concealed by a range of precipices, with\r\nbroad sheets of snow here and there, resting at an extraordinary high\r\nangle, as we soon found to our cost, and having their crests notched, and\r\npillared, and serrated in the wildest manner. The floor of the valley was\r\ncovered with masses of rock and boulder, hurled from the surrounding\r\ncliffs, and heaps and sheets of rough gravel, ground and crushed by the\r\navalanches, and fissured by the torrents of melted snow. The silence of the\r\nAlp-spirit, as silent as death itself, was in it; only at intervals was\r\nheard the whispering 'sough' of some slip of snow, dislodged by the warmth\r\nof the mid-day sun.\r\n\r\nWe advanced stealthily, concealing ourselves behind the boulders, and\r\nsearched valley and cliff in vain for our prey. Joseph was the proud\r\npossessor of a telescope, mysteriously fashioned out of paper and\r\ncardboard; a pretty good one, nevertheless, brought from Italy by some\r\ntravelling pedlar, and an object of great veneration, but one which failed\r\nin discovering a single chamois. Our only chance now was that they might be\r\nfeeding in some of the smaller valleys, between the cliffs at the head of\r\nthe basin in which we were and the Koegle itself.\r\n\r\n\"Feeding! what could they be feeding on, when you say yourself that you\r\nleft all kinds of 'green stuff' behind you long ago.\"\r\n\r\nSo _I_ thought, too, doubtless, by this time, most impatient reader; but on\r\nthe screes at the head of the valley, Joseph showed me, for the first time,\r\nthe plant on which these extraordinary animals in a great measure live. It\r\nhas a thick green, trilobate leaf, and a flower so delicate and gauze-like,\r\nthat one wonders how it can bear for a moment the harsh storms to which it\r\nis exposed. Its petals have a most curious crumpled appearance, and are of\r\nthe softest pink imaginable--almost transparent. As for its class and\r\norder, you must go elsewhere for them; I know them not; nor the name either\r\nwhich the Latins would have called it if they had been aware of its\r\nexistence. Joseph called it \"gemsenkraut,\" or chamois herb, and that was\r\nenough for me.\r\n\r\nHaving finished our botanical investigations, we pushed on to the upper end\r\nof the valley, and found that the cliffs, and screes, and snow-patches\r\nlooked uglier and steeper the nearer we approached them. However, there was\r\nno retreat--onward we must go, or be declared \"nidding\" through the length\r\nand breadth of the Tyrol.\r\n\r\nOh! those screes--those screes! lying at an angle of goodness knows how\r\nmuch with the horizon--sharp, slaty, angular pieces of stone, like savage\r\nhatchets, slippery as glass, glancing from under our feet, and casting us\r\ndown sideways on their abominable edges, \"sliddering\" down by the ton,\r\ncarrying our unfortunate persons yards below where we wanted to go,\r\ncrashing and clattering, and then dancing and bounding far down into the\r\nvalley, like mischievous gnomes, delighted with the bumpings and bruisings\r\nthey had treated us to! How Joseph did anathematize! For my part, mine was\r\na grief \"too deep for swears!\"\r\n\r\nAfter crossing, still ascending, two or three beds of screes, we came to\r\nthe edge of the first snow-field; not very broad, it is true, but lying at\r\na higher angle than I ever thought possible, and frozen as hard as marble\r\non the surface--one sheet of ice, with an agreeable fall of some hundred\r\nfeet at its lower edge. We were in despair! We had now got excited and\r\nconfident--our \"blood was up;\" and here came \"the impossible to stop us.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what is it that Joseph has picked up from the snow, and is examining\r\nso carefully?\"\r\n\r\n\"No matter--'twas not what we sought,\" but it _was_ something closely\r\nconnected with it.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, there is no doubt of it; they have been here, and lately too! See the\r\nsharp hoof-prints just above! They must have crossed this morning! Go it,\r\nye cripples (_in prospectu_), we must cross this, come what may.\"\r\n\r\nWe got along steadily, without any slides, though with many slips, always\r\nsticking our staves convulsively into the snow the moment our heels seemed\r\nto have the slightest disposition to assume the altitude of our heads. It\r\nwas nervous work--one slip, one moment too late in thrusting our staff\r\nperpendicularly in the snow, as an anchor, and away we should have shot\r\nlike a meteor over the glittering surface for a hundred terrible yards, and\r\nthen with a wild bound have been launched into the abyss below. However, we\r\ncould not have turned back if we had wished it, and at last, to our intense\r\nsatisfaction, we grasped the rough rock that bounded the further side of\r\nthe field. Grasped it!--we embraced it!--we clung to its rough surface as\r\nif we had been six months at sea, and had landed in the Hesperides!\r\n\r\nAt length on the summit of the ridge, we were able to crouch down and look\r\nthrough a crack in the rock into the next valley. Round and about, above\r\nand below, we examined every hole and corner; half-a-dozen times some\r\nvillanous stone made our hearts leap to our mouths. But alas! \"it was no\r\ngo;\" there was not a living thing in sight--barrenness, barrenness, and\r\ndesolation.\r\n\r\nOur chance of chamois was utterly over for the day. _N'importe._ Better\r\nluck to-morrow. Who can feel out of spirits in that brisk mountain\r\natmosphere? There is the highest peak of the Wildgrad Koegle right before\r\nus--and hang him, we'll dine on his head.\r\n\r\nThe ridge on which we found ourselves was but a few feet broad, and about a\r\nhundred and fifty feet above the snow on each side. It was composed of\r\ninnumerable irregular pillar-like masses of rock, of different heights and\r\ndistances, impossible to descend at the point where we found ourselves, but\r\nas it ran at the same general level, we fancied that we could get on the\r\nsloping mass of snow which lay on the side of the peak at some distance on.\r\nJumping from one small table of rock to another--now only saved from\r\n\"immortal smash\" by Joseph's strong arm, and now swaying doubtfully on a\r\n_plateau_ the size of a small dumb-waiter top, uncertain whether we should\r\nbe off or not--we hopped along, wishing we were kangaroos, till we found a\r\ncrevice which seemed practicable, and down which I went with a run--or\r\nrather a slide, much quicker than was agreeable, being only brought up by\r\nmy feet coming on Joseph's broad shoulders, he taking, as I must confess he\r\ngenerally did, the first place, whereby he always came in for a double\r\nallowance of stones and gravel, but about which he seemed utterly\r\nindifferent.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the bottom, we found that, as usual, the snow had melted some\r\ndistance from the rock, leaving a mighty pretty crack to receive us.\r\nHowever, a lucky jump landed us safely, and for a moment erect, on the\r\nsnow, and then head over heels, rolling, and bumping, and kicking, we spun\r\nover the slippery surface till we managed to bring ourselves up about fifty\r\nyards below where we had started. But in spite of tumbles we were in high\r\nspirits: there were no gems to frighten, and no more tottering avalanches,\r\nready to fall on our heads if we as much as ventured to use our\r\npocket-handkerchiefs.\r\n\r\nWe toiled up the terribly steep snow-patch merrily enough, not without\r\nretracing our path several times in a manner at once undignified and\r\nunexpected--though it certainly was not to be complained of as far as speed\r\nwent--and reached, at last, utterly blown and sick with exertion, the base\r\nof the rock forming the summit of the mountain. Hardly giving ourselves\r\ntime to recover, we climbed up the last sixty or seventy feet of cliff, and\r\nI found myself--first this time, for a wonder--on a small platform, the\r\nsummit of the Wildgrad Koegle.\r\n\r\nThe platform was some ten or twelve feet square, and the only approach to\r\nit was on the side we had ascended; on every other the cliff ran down in a\r\nsheer wall, how deep I know not, for I never could judge of distances from\r\nabove.\r\n\r\nAs for describing what we saw from our elevated dining-table, it is clean\r\nout of the question; we saw nothing but mountains--or rather the tops of\r\nmountains, for we were far above the general level of their crests; one\r\nwide sea of rock and snow surged around us; shoreless, no bounding range,\r\nno sweet glimpses of broad green valleys and glistening rivers in the\r\ndistance; no pretty villages nestling cosily under the pine forest--nothing\r\nbut peak on peak, ridge on ridge; bright pinnacles and clusters of\r\npinnacles shooting up here and there far above the rest into the calm blue\r\nsky--deep grooves marking the course of distant valleys, like tide-marks on\r\nthe sea. But no trace of man or beast, herb or tree; the very wind that\r\nwhistled past us brought no sound or scent from the valleys it had passed,\r\nbut sounded harsh, and dry, and dead. Vain, indeed would be the effort to\r\nconvey the slightest idea of the solemn grandeur of that scene! Manfred?\r\nManfred gives the finest and truest picture ever perhaps painted of _Swiss_\r\nAlpine scenery, as seen looking towards the mountains, or from the cliffs\r\nbordering some rich pastoral valley; but we had passed all that long\r\nago--we were in the very heart of the range. Alp was still piled on Alp,\r\nbut we had reached the summit of the pile. The only valleys _we_ saw were\r\nfearful scars in the mountain flank, half filled with eternal snow, and the\r\ncrumbling skeletons of dead Alps. No sound--no herdsman's joedle--no\r\ncowbell's tinkle ever reached to half way up our rocky perch: we were far\r\nabove the vulture and the chamois. We were alone with the rock, and snow,\r\nand sky! It seemed profanity to whisper--and yet there was Joseph, after a\r\nglance round, and a short \"schoene panorama!\" whistling and fishing up the\r\neatables and drinkables from the bottom of his wallet, as coolly as if he\r\nwas seated in his own smoky, half-lighted cabin. He had been born in it,\r\nand was used to it. I doubt whether I myself felt the grandeur of the scene\r\nas much then as I have often done since, on recalling it bit by bit to my\r\nrecollection. The really grand gives one at first a sort of painful feeling\r\nthat is indescribable. One cannot _think_--one only _feels_ with that\r\nstrange undescribed sense, that strives, almost to heart-breaking, to bring\r\nitself forth, and yet stays voiceless.\r\n\r\nWe sat long, drinking in alternate draughts of sublimity and Slibowitz (as\r\nJoseph called the brandy), till the Berg-geist kindly put an end to our\r\nexstasies by drawing a dark gray veil over the whole picture, and pelting\r\nus with snow-flakes, as a gentle hint to be off and leave him to his\r\ncogitations. It began, indeed, to snow in real earnest, and the weather\r\nlooked mighty dark and unpromising, so we scrambled hastily down the way we\r\ncame, and leaning well back on our alpenstocks with our feet stretched out\r\nbefore us, shot down the long sheet of snow, at a considerably quicker rate\r\nthan we had ascended; and gliding scornfully past our columnar friends,\r\nwhose fantastic capitals had given us so much trouble in the morning, we\r\nreached, with many a tumble and much laughter, the stony ravine at its\r\nfoot.\r\n\r\nScorning to finish the day without drawing blood from something besides\r\nourselves, we determined to commit slaughter on whatever came across us. We\r\nsoon heard the shrill signal-whistle of the marmot, and for want of better\r\ngame, determined to bag at least one of these exceedingly wide-awake\r\ngentlemen. Creeping to the top of a neighboring ridge, we peeped cautiously\r\nover into a little valley floored with a confused mass of mossy stones and\r\nstraggling alpen-rosen. Here several of these quaint little beasts, half\r\nrat, half rabbit, were frisking in and out of their burrows, cutting all\r\nsorts of what Joseph called, 'Burzelbaume,' Anglice, capers; little\r\nsuspecting that the all-destroying monster, man, had his eye upon them. One\r\nfellow, the sentinel, took my particular fancy as he sat up on his nether\r\nend on a large stone. There was an expression of unutterable self-conceit\r\nand conscious wide-awakefulness about his blunt muzzle and exposed incisors\r\nthat was perfectly delicious. Him I determined to bring to bag, and\r\ncautiously raising my carbine--crack! Over he rolled, I have no doubt, too\r\nastonished to feel any pain, his friends tumbling madly head over heels\r\ninto their burrows, whilst the astonished echoes repeated crack! crack!\r\nagain and again, in all sorts of tones and modulations, till warned to\r\nsilence by the harsh rattle of an old mountain a mile off. We bagged our\r\nfriend, who looked every wit as conceited in death as he did when alive,\r\nand recommenced our descent. On our way we shot a brace of \"schnee huhner,\"\r\na species of ptarmigan, a pack of which very _slow_ birds were running\r\nstupidly in and out amongst the rocks--and hurried on. It was growing very\r\ndark, the snow fell heavily, and the wind began rushing and eddying round\r\nus, depositing the largest and coldest of the snow-flakes in our ears and\r\neyes, till we were half-blinded and wholly deaf. Joseph began to look\r\nserious, and hunted about for a small torrent he knew of, to serve as a\r\nguide, and after some trouble and anxiety, we found it, and stumbled down\r\nits rocky banks till we came to a solitary sennhutt, which was to be our\r\nresting-place for the night.\r\n\r\nAfter some trouble, we got the door open, and found that the hut was\r\nfortunately not entirely filled with hay; a space about six or eight feet\r\nbroad had been boarded off between it and the outer wall for the use of the\r\nwild-hauer. This was to serve us as parlor and kitchen and all, except\r\nbed-room, which was to be sought for in the hay-stack itself. Our floor was\r\nthe bare earth; the logs which formed the wall were badly jointed, and the\r\nwind whistled through the gaping cracks in the most uncomfortable manner;\r\none could almost fancy that it was trying to articulate the dreaded word,\r\nrheu--matism.\r\n\r\nHowever, the ever-active Joseph, bustling about, found some dry wood, and\r\nwe made a blazing fire on the floor at the imminent risk of burning our\r\nbeds, and slightly thawed ourselves; we continued our researches, and found\r\na shallow wooden pail, carefully covered over, holding some two gallons of\r\nsour milk, left by the charitable hay-man some fortnight before, for the\r\nuse of any benighted hunter who might have the luck to stumble on the hut,\r\nand one of those abominable one-legged milking-stools, so common in that\r\npart of the world, which, having vainly endeavored to sit on, and having\r\ntumbled into the fire in consequence, to Joseph's intense amusement, I\r\nhurled madly over the hay out into the storm.\r\n\r\nAs the clatter made amongst the shingles of the roof by its hasty exist\r\nsubsided, we heard a noise which struck terror into both our hearts, and\r\nwould doubtless have chilled our very marrow, if it had not been below\r\nfreezing-point already. Devils! Berg-geister! Fly! out into the black\r\nstorm! over the precipice! into the torrent! before some fearful mopping\r\nand mowing face, too ghastly horrible for human eye-ball to see without\r\nbursting, or human brain to conceive without madness, gibber out upon us\r\nfrom that dark corner! Listen: there it is again! And--mew-w-w-w-w! down\r\ntumbled between us a miserable, half-grown, gray kitten, nearly dead with\r\ncold and starvation, doubtless absent on some poaching expedition when the\r\nhut was deserted, and not thought worth the going back for. Oh! the joy of\r\nthat unfortunate little beast at seeing man and fire once more! How she\r\nstaggered about with tail erect, vainly trying to mew and purr at the same\r\ntime! having to be perpetually pulled out of the fire, and \"put out,\" to\r\nprevent her playing the part of one of Samson's foxes with our beds,\r\nfilling the cabin with unspeakable smells of singed hair! And now she would\r\npersist in walking up our backs, and tickling us to madness with her\r\nscorched tail!\r\n\r\nHaving disposed of \"Catchins,\" as she was immediately named, as well as we\r\ncould, by tossing her by the tail to the top of the hay, whenever she\r\ndescended to thank us, which happened about three times in every two\r\nminutes, we \"fixed\" our suppers, broiling the schnee-huhner over the bright\r\nfire, and enjoyed ourselves mightily. After a smoke and a short\r\ncross-examination from Joseph as to our friends, family, and expectations,\r\nand particular inquiries for the shortest overland route to England, and\r\nthe number of years required for the journey, we climbed up into the hay,\r\nand grubbed and wormed our way for two or three feet below its surface,\r\nand, making unto ourselves each a \"spiracle\" or blow-hole over our\r\nrespective noses, tried to slumber.\r\n\r\nNow, a bed of short, sweet Alpine grass, fragrant with the spirits of a\r\nthousand departed flowers, is as warm, cozy, and elastic as a bed can be,\r\nbut it has one unfortunate drawback,--the small straws and dust falling\r\ndown the before-mentioned spiracle, tickle and titilate one's unfortunate\r\nface and nose in a most distracting manner; and as you utterly destroy the\r\nsnug economy of your couch, and let in a rush of cold mountain air, as\r\noften as you raise your hand to brush away the annoyance, some fastidious\r\npersons might possibly prefer a modest mattress, with a fair allowance of\r\nsheets and blankets.\r\n\r\nAt last, however, I was dozing off, tired of hearing Joseph muttering what\r\ncertainly were not his prayers, rustling fretfully, and sneezing\r\ntrumpet-like at intervals, as some straw, more inquisitive than usual, made\r\na tour of inspection up his nostril, when I suddenly heard a round Tyrolese\r\noath rapped out with great fervor, and something whirled over my head and\r\nplumped against the timbers of the roof. Dreamily supposing that it was the\r\naforesaid cumbrous Tyrolese execration, which Joseph had jerked out with\r\nsuch energy as to send it clean back into oblivion, when something with an\r\nevil smell, and making a noise like a miniature stocking-machine, tumbled\r\ndown my spiracle, plump into my face. Waking fully, I at once perceived\r\nthat it was the cat, not the oath, I had heard fly over me shortly before,\r\nshe, in the excess of her gratitude, being determined to stick as closely\r\nto us as possible. Following Joseph's example, I seized her by the tail,\r\nand whirled her, purring uninterruptedly, as far as I could. Ere many\r\nminutes had elapsed, she was again launched forth by the infuriated Joseph,\r\nand backwards and forwards she flew at least half-a-dozen times between us,\r\nwithout appearing in the least disconcerted, perhaps, indeed, finding the\r\nexercise conducive to the assimilation of the sour milk, till Nature could\r\nstand no more, and we fell fast asleep.\r\n\r\nWhether she spent the night on our faces, in alternate watches, I know not,\r\nbut I had ghastly dreams, and when I woke in the morning, I found my hand\r\nand arm thrust forth from the hay, reposing on a cool and clean counterpane\r\nof snow, which had drifted in during the night, as if I had been repelling\r\nher advances even in my sleep.\r\n\r\nFeeling very cold and damp, we turned out as soon as we woke, and blowing\r\nup the embers of the fire, warmed ourselves as well as we could, and took a\r\npeep out into the night. The storm had passed away, leaving everything\r\ncovered with a veil of snow, that gleamed faintly under the intense\r\nblack-blue sky. The stars were beginning to assume that peculiar sleepy,\r\ntwinkling appearance which shows that their night-watch is drawing to a\r\nclose, and everything lay in still, calm rest around us.\r\n\r\nWe breakfasted sparingly, as our provisions were beginning to run short,\r\nthanks to the keen mountain air and our hard work the day before, and just\r\nas the first cold chill of the approaching dawn began to be felt, we left\r\nthe cabin, shutting up Catchins, and hanging the marmot on a peg out of her\r\nreach, till our return.\r\n\r\nOur day's route lay more round to the left of the Wildgrad Koegle. The scene\r\nwas for some time a repetition of that of the day before, but the cliffs\r\nwere still more precipitous and the ravines narrower and more difficult to\r\ntraverse. Many a tumble we got for the first hour amongst the boulders\r\ncovered with treacherous moss and cowberry plants, but before sunrise we\r\nhad left all vegetation behind us again, and were up amongst the crags and\r\nthe snow.\r\n\r\nAs we ascended, we saw a valley to our left, filled to the brim with dense\r\nmist, which, as soon as the sun began to tinge the highest peaks, rose in\r\nswirling columns, and shut out every thing that was not in our immediate\r\nvicinity. This was advantageous, as, although it prevented our _seeing_, it\r\nat the same time prevented our being _seen_, from the cliffs before we\r\nreached our best ground. We toiled on steadily, crossing vast beds of snow,\r\nand occasionally the roots of some glacier, that threw itself into the\r\nvalleys to our left, climbing, scrambling, and slipping, but still steadily\r\nascending, till we got to where Joseph expected to fall in with chamois,\r\nwhen we called a halt, and sheltering ourselves behind a mass of rock from\r\nthe keen morning wind, waited for the clearing of the mist.\r\n\r\nThe Alp-spirit seemed to be amusing himself mightily with this same mist!\r\nat one moment, catching it up in huge masses, he piled it on the sharp\r\npeaks, as if to make himself a comfortable cushion; and then, sitting\r\nsuddenly down to try its efficacy, drove it in all directions by his\r\n\"lubber weight.\" Enraged, he tossed and tumbled it about for some time, and\r\nat last spread it into one broad level plain, with the higher peaks\r\nstanding out clear and sharp, like rocks from a calm sea. Now and then the\r\nmist would disappear entirely for a few moments, leaving everything clear\r\nand bright; then a small cloud, \"like a man's hand,\" would form on the side\r\nof some distant peak, and spreading out with inconceivable rapidity, would\r\nenvelope us in its boiling wreaths, while the wind, ever and anon rushing\r\ndown some unexpected gully, cut a tunnel right through it, giving us\r\nglimpses of distant mountains and snow-fields, looking near and strange as\r\nif seen through a telescope.\r\n\r\nAt last the sun began to shine out cheerily and steadily, and the breeze\r\ngave a freshness and buoyance to our spirits never to be felt except on\r\nhigh mountains. The heavy atmosphere of the valley squeezes one's soul into\r\nits case, and sits on the lid like an incubus. That blessed mountain-spirit\r\nis the only power who takes the lid off altogether, and lets the soul out\r\nof its larva-case to revel in the strange beauties of his domain without\r\nrestraint!\r\n\r\nAfter a time, we found ourselves in a region of snow-fields, filling up\r\nbroad valleys, lying calm and shadowless in the bright sunshine. Here and\r\nthere, they were marked by delicate blue lines, where the crevasses allowed\r\nthe substratum of ice to be seen, showing that these apparently eternal and\r\nimmovable plains of snow were slowly but steadily flowing downwards, to\r\nappear as splintered glaciers in the valley far below; and here and there\r\nagain, dark ridges, standing sharply up from the snow-bed, marked the\r\ncourse of buried mountain ranges, and gave some idea of the vast depth of\r\nthe deposit.\r\n\r\nBut wonderfully beautiful as these plains were, and strange and wild as\r\nthey appeared to an English eye, with a brilliant August sun pouring his\r\nwhole flood of light and warmth upon them, they were not the great points\r\nof interest to us. Those mighty ranges of cliff, rising tier above tier to\r\nour right, fretted with a pure white lace-work of fresh fallen snow, with\r\nhere and there vast beds of screes shot from above, giving promise of\r\ngemsenkraut, were the bits we scanned with the greatest eagerness. We had\r\ncome for chamois, and I am afraid, looked upon the rest as of very\r\nsecondary importance.\r\n\r\nWe were advancing along the base of the lowest tier of cliff, which had a\r\nsort of step of snow running along it about half-way up for some\r\nhalf-a-mile, bounded at one end by an immense mass of screes and precipice,\r\nand at the other by a sudden turn of the rock, when Joseph suddenly dashing\r\noff his hat and throwing himself prostrate behind a stone, dragged me down\r\nbeside him, with a vice-like grasp, that left its mark on my arm for many a\r\nday after. Utterly taken aback at the suddenness of my prostration, I lay\r\nbeside him, wondering at the change that had come over his face; he was as\r\nwhite as marble, his moustache worked with intense excitement, and his\r\neyeballs seemed starting from their sockets as he glared at the cliff.\r\nFollowing his line of sight, I glanced upwards, and my eye was instantly\r\narrested by something--it moved--again--and again! With shaking hand I\r\ndirected the telescope to the point, and there, at the end of it, hopping\r\nfearlessly on the shivered mountain side, scratching its ear with its hind\r\nfoot, and nibbling daintily the scattered bits of gemsenkraut that spring\r\nup between the stones, stood fearless and free--a chamois!\r\n\r\nAfter watching him with intense interest for some moments, we drew back,\r\nscarcely daring to breathe, and sheltering ourselves behind a large stone,\r\nheld a council of war. It was evidently impossible to approach him from\r\nwhere we were: we could not have moved ten steps towards him without the\r\ncertainty of being discovered; our only chance was to get above him and so\r\ncut him off from the higher ranges. Crawling backwards, we managed to place\r\na low range of rock between ourselves and the cliffs, and then making a\r\nwide sweep, we reached their base at some distance from where the chamois\r\nwas feeding.\r\n\r\nAfter examining the precipice for some time, we found that the only mode of\r\naccess to its summit, here some three or four hundred feet above us, was by\r\na sort of ravine, what would be called in the Swiss Alps, a _cheminee_ a\r\nspecies of fracture in the strata the broken edges of which would give us\r\nsome foot and hand hold: at its upper termination we could see the end of a\r\nsmall glacier, slightly overhanging the cliff, from which a small stream\r\nleapt from ledge to ledge, only alive in the last hour or two of\r\nsun-warmth, giving promises, which certainly were faithfully fulfilled, of\r\nadditional slipperiness and discomfort. But we had no choice; we had\r\nalready spent nearly an hour in our cautious circuit. Our scramble,\r\nwherever it took place, would cost us nearly another before we got above\r\nour expected prey, and if we hesitated much longer, he might take a fancy\r\nto march off altogether in search of the rest of the herd. So up we went,\r\ndragging ourselves and each other up the wet slippery rocks, getting a\r\nshivering \"swish\" of ice-cold water in our faces every now and then, till\r\nwe got about half-way up, when, just as we were resting for a moment to\r\ntake breath, we heard a tremendous roar, followed by a splintering crash\r\njust above our heads, and had the pleasure of seeing the fragments of some\r\nhalf-a-ton of ice, which had fallen from the glacier above, fly out from\r\nthe shelf of rock under which we were resting, and spin down the rugged\r\npath we had just ascended.\r\n\r\nThinking that this was quite near enough to be pleasant, and \"calculating\"\r\nthat by every doctrine of chances the same thing would not happen twice in\r\nthe same half-hour, we scrambled up as fast as we could before the next\r\ninstalment became due, and at last reached safely the top of the precipice.\r\n\r\nWe certainly had not much to boast of as far as walking went, when we got\r\nthere, for the snow and rocks were tumbled about in a very wild manner. If\r\nwe slipped off a rock, we tumbled waist-deep into the soft, melting\r\nsnow-drifts, and when we tumbled on the snow, there was always some lurking\r\nrock ready to remind us of his presence by a hearty thump; however, as we\r\nwere fairly above the chamois, our excitement carried us on. I do not think\r\nthat Joseph swore once; we found afterwards indeed, to our cost, that in\r\none of his involuntary summersets, he had broken _the_ bottle, and narrowly\r\nescaped being bayoneted by the fragments: however, we did not know it then,\r\nand so scrambled on in contented ignorance, until we reached the spot on\r\nthe cliffs to our right, which we had marked as being above our prey. Here,\r\nhowever, we found that it was impossible to get near enough to the edge to\r\nlook over, as the fresh-fallen snow threatened to part company from the\r\nrock and carry us with it, on the slightest indiscretion on our parts.\r\nCrouching down in the snow, we listened for some hint of our friend's\r\nwhereabouts, and had not waited more than a minute, when the faint clatter\r\nof a stone far below convinced us that he was on the move: keeping low, we\r\nwallowed along till we came to where the crest of the cliff showing a\r\nlittle above the snow, gave us a tolerable shelter; carefully crawling to\r\nthe edge, we peeped over, and saw, as we expected, that the gems had\r\nshifted his quarters, and as luck would have it, was standing on the\r\nsnow-bed half-way up the cliff, immediately below us.\r\n\r\nTrembling, partly with excitement, and partly from the under-waistcoat of\r\nhalf-melted snow we had unconsciously assumed in our serpentine wrigglings,\r\nwe lay and watched the graceful animal below us. He evidently had a\r\npresentiment that there was something \"no canny\" about the mountain-side;\r\nsome eddy had perhaps reached his delicate nostrils, laden with the taint\r\nof an intruder. With his head high in the air, and his ears pointed\r\nforwards, he stood examining--as wiser brutes than he sometimes do--every\r\npoint of the compass but the right. One foot was advanced; one moment more,\r\nand he would have gone; when crack! close to my ear, jut as I was screwing\r\nup my nerves for a long shot, went Joseph's heavy rifle. With a sinking\r\nheart I saw the brute take a tremendous bound, all four hoofs together, and\r\nthen, like a rifle-ball glancing over the bosom of a calm lake, bound after\r\nbound carried him away and away over the snow-field, and round the corner\r\nto our right, before I had recovered my senses sufficiently to take a\r\ndesperate snap at him.\r\n\r\nWhat we said, or felt, or how we got over the face of that cliff, I know\r\nnot. A dim recollection of falling stones and dust showering round\r\nus--pieces of treacherous rock giving way in our hands and under our feet,\r\nbruising slides, and one desperate jump over the chasm between the cliff\r\nand the snow,--and there we were both, standing pale and breathless,\r\nstraining our eyes for some scarcely expected trace of blood to give us\r\nhope.\r\n\r\nNot a drop tinged the unsullied snow at the place where he had made his\r\nfirst mad bound, nor at the second, nor at the third; but a few paces\r\nfurther on, one ruby-tinged hole showed where the hot blood had sunk\r\nthrough the melting snow.\r\n\r\nToo excited to feel any uprising of envy, hatred, or malice against my more\r\nfortunate companion, I raced along the white incline, leaving him behind\r\nreloading his rifle,--which was always a sort of solemn rite with him,--and\r\nfollowing, without difficulty, the deep indentations of the animal's hoofs,\r\nI came to where the cliff receded into a sort of small bay, with its patch\r\nof snow on the same plane with the one I was on, but separated from it by a\r\nrugged promontory of cliff and broken rock. Cautiously I scrambled round\r\nthe point, removing many a stone that seemed inclined to fall and give the\r\nalarm to the watchful chamois, and peeping cautiously round the last mass\r\nof rock that separated me from the snow-patch, I saw the poor brute,\r\nstanding not more than sixty yards from me, his hoofs drawn close together\r\nunder him, ready for a desperate rush at the cliff at the first sound that\r\nreached him; his neck stretched out, and his muzzle nearly touching the\r\nsnow, straining every sense to catch some inkling of the whereabouts of the\r\nmischief he felt was near him.\r\n\r\nWith my face glowing as if it had been freshly blistered, a dryness and\r\nlumping in my throat, as if I had just escaped from an unsuccessful display\r\nof Mr. Calcraft's professional powers, and my heart thud-thudding against\r\nmy ribs at such a rate that I really thought the gems must hear it in the\r\nstillness, I raised my carbine. Once, at the neck just behind the ear, I\r\nsaw the brown hide clear at the end of the barrel, but I dared not risk\r\nsuch a chance; and so, straining my nerves, I shifted my aim to just behind\r\nthe shoulder,--one touch of the cold trigger, and as the thin gases\r\nstreamed off, rejoicing at their liberation, I saw the chamois shrink\r\nconvulsively when the ball struck him, and then fall heavily on the snow,\r\nshot right through the heart. With a who-whoop! that might have been heard\r\nhalf-way to Innspruck, I rushed up to him;--one sweep of the knife--the red\r\nblood bubbled out on to the snow that shrunk and wasted before its hot\r\ntouch, as if it felt itself polluted, and there lay stretched out in all\r\nits beauty before me the first gems I ever killed--just as Joseph came up,\r\npanting, yelling, and joedling, and rejoicing at my success, without a shade\r\nof envy in his honest heart.\r\n\r\nNow I believe, in all propriety, we ought to have been melancholy, and\r\nmoralized over the slain. That rich, soft black eye, filming over with the\r\nfrosty breath of death, and that last convulsive kick of the hind legs,\r\nought perhaps to have made us feel that we had done rather a brutal and\r\nselfish thing; but they did not. This is a truthful narrative, and I must\r\nconfess that our only feeling was one of unmixed rejoicing.\r\n\r\nI have occasionally moralized over a trout, flopping about amongst the\r\ndaisies and buttercups, and dying that horrible suffocation death of my\r\ncausing; but it was never, if I remember right, the _first_ trout I had\r\nkilled that day. My feelings always get finer as my pannier gets fuller,\r\nparticularly if it be a warm afternoon, and I have _lunched_.\r\n\r\nBut as for the unfortunate gems, we rejoiced over him exceedingly; we shook\r\nhands over him; we sat beside him, and on him; we examined him, carefully,\r\nminutely, scientifically, from stem to stem. I firmly believe that I could\r\npick him out at this moment from the thousand ghosts that attend the\r\nsilver-horned Gemsen Koenig, if I had but the good luck to fall in with his\r\nmajesty and his charmed suite.\r\n\r\nJoseph's ball had struck him high up on the neck, but had not inflicted any\r\nthing like a severe wound. Had we fired on him from below, he would have\r\nscaled the cliffs in a moment, and been no more seen, at least by us; but\r\nas he knew that the mischief was above him, he dared not ascend--to descend\r\nwas impossible; and so, getting to a certain extent pounded, he gave me the\r\nrare chance of a second shot.\r\n\r\nLong we sat and gazed at the chamois; and the wild scene before us--never\r\nshall I forget it!--shut in on three sides by steep and frowning cliffs, in\r\nfront the precipice, and far, far down, the wild rocky valleys, divided by\r\nshivered ridges, rising higher and higher till they mounted up into the\r\ncalm, pure snow range, set in the frame of the jutting promontories on each\r\nside of us--looking the brighter and the \"holier\" from the comparative\r\nshade in which we were. Not a sound but the occasional faint \"swish\" of the\r\nwaterfall that drained from the snow-bed,--not a living thing _now_ but our\r\ntwo selves standing side by side on the snow. We had killed the third, and\r\nthere he lay stiffening between us!\r\n\r\nBut, hillo! Joseph! we are nearly getting sentimental, after all, over this\r\nbrute, (that I should say so!) who has all but broken our necks already,\r\nand who in all human probability will do so entirely before we have done\r\nwith him. Fish up the decanter, and let us have a schnaps over our quarry;\r\nmy throat and lips are burning, as if I had lunched off quicklime. Well,\r\nwhat are you fumbling at? Oh, horror! Joseph's hand returns empty from the\r\nbag, with a large cut on one of the fingers--weeping tears of blood! The\r\nbottle is smashed!--smashed to atoms! and the unconscious Joseph has had\r\nthe celestial liquor trickling down his back--how long he know not, and\r\ncare not; it is \"gone, and for ever!\"\r\n\r\n    Like the summer-dried fountain,\r\n    When our need is the sorest!\r\n\r\nBut it is of no use blaspheming in that manner, Joseph; not one of those\r\nten hundred and fifty millions of bad spirits you are invoking so freely,\r\nwill bring us back one drop of our good ones; so we must e'en \"girn and\r\nbide.\" But still it is as bad as bad can be,--not a drop of water for hours\r\nto come, perhaps.\r\n\r\n    Water, water, everywhere,\r\n    Nor any drop to drink.\r\n\r\nMunching snow only chars one's lips like hot cinders, and the cool \"swish\"\r\nof the waterfall there below us only makes one the more thirsty. Let us be\r\noff out of ear-shot of it, at any rate. Take up the gems, and let us dream\r\nof cool, bubbling runlets and iced sour milk as we go.\r\n\r\nDream! quotha! we must dream of how we are to go at all, first, and a very\r\nnightmarey sort of dream it promises to be; we are regularly pounded; not a\r\nvestige of a crack or crevice up which to worm ourselves in the whole face\r\nof the semicircular range of cliffs beneath which we stand; and moreover,\r\nthey are all of that upside down, overhanging style, that precludes all\r\nclimbing. We must retrace our steps as we best can, and try where we\r\ndescended.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Joseph, where did we come down--eh?\" Not there!\r\nNonsense!--impossible! Yes! too true; there it was; there are our tracks in\r\nthe snow, and the dust and stones that were so obliging as to accompany us\r\nto the bottom, and be hanged to them! But the cliff has surely grown since\r\nthen. It looks as high as Gallantry Bower, in dear old North Devon.--I wish\r\nI were at the top or bottom either of _that_, instead of where I am! There\r\nis not a hundred feet difference between them. Three hundred feet, the\r\ncliff is, if an inch! We can never do it! Let us make a cast round by the\r\nscrees, and see if we cannot get down that way.\r\n\r\nWe did so, but found that they were quite impassable. What looked like a\r\ncontinuous shoot when seen from below, we found to be divided by two or\r\nthree ledges of rock, and the angle at which they lay, rendered it\r\nimpossible for any thing heavier footed than a gems to pass them. We must\r\nup the cliff! We had no choice.\r\n\r\nNow, to begin, it was no easy thing to get at the cliff at all. That\r\nconfounded gap between the snow and the rock was bad enough to get across\r\nfrom above; but to jump up from the sloping snow slap against the face of\r\nthe rock was ten times worse. However, Joseph having uncoiled a few yards\r\nof line from his waist, and made it fast to the gems, tightened his belt,\r\nand took the crack gallantly, lighting on a narrow ledge, with his nose\r\nalmost touching the rock, to which he stuck like a limpet for a moment, and\r\nthen, having steadied himself, turned round and seated himself, with his\r\nlegs dangling over the chasm. Now came my turn. Having thrown the end of\r\nthe line to Joseph--after vainly looking for a promising ledge to land on,\r\nI yielded to his entreaties, and swung myself right _at_ him. We grasped\r\neach other pretty tight, you may be assured, gentle reader; and after\r\nswaying for a moment or two over the abyss, I climbed up him, and getting\r\nmy feet on his shoulders, I managed to draw myself up to a ledge a few feet\r\nhigher. Now came my turn to turn, and a most unpleasant piece of gymnastics\r\nit was. The ledge was not an inch too broad, and the rock below only rough\r\nenough to _scratch_ against, not to give any firm foot-hold. However, I at\r\nlast got my back against the rock pretty firmly; and Joseph, who had\r\ndragged the gems up from the snow, threw me the end of the line, which,\r\nafter one or two unsuccessful grabs, that nearly toppled me over from my\r\n\"bad eminence,\" I caught, and with his assistance, got the gems up to me,\r\nand rested it across my knees. Joseph now turned his face to the rock, and\r\ngetting up to me, placed one of his iron-soled shoes on my thigh, and the\r\nother on my shoulder, and climbed over and past me. As soon as he was\r\nfirmly fixed, I threw him up the end of the line, and, felt much relieved\r\nof the weight of the chamois, whose rough hide rubbed lovingly over my face\r\nas it passed me, and turning round, and standing upon my ledge, laid hold\r\nof Joseph by the ankle, and again climbed up him and past him, to be\r\nclimbed up and over in my turn. Over and over we had to repeat the same\r\nmanoeuvre, varied occasionally by our being unable to turn or to sit down\r\nfrom the narrowness of the ledges, and then the strain was terrible. If we\r\nhad not come sometimes to a broader ledge than usual, which allowed us to\r\nlie down and get an easier hold of the line, as it dangled like a plummet\r\nover the cliff, we, or at least I, could never have reached the top of the\r\ncliff _with_ the gems, and I very much doubt whether either of us would\r\nhave cared much to have done so _without_ it. What was before me I hardly\r\nknew. Imitating as well as I could the happy _insouciance_ of a snail\r\n\"sliming\" up the side of the Parthenon, I tried to restrict my range of\r\nvision to points immediately near me. I never felt giddy in my life; but I\r\nfelt that it would be running a terrible risk to look into the immensity\r\nthat lay stretched out below me, like another world.\r\n\r\nHowever, every thing in this world must have at least one end, even an\r\nAlpine cliff. And at last, as I drew myself up, I found myself face to face\r\nwith the snow. The last step was by no means the easiest or safest; but in\r\na few moments all three of us, Joseph, the chamois, and myself, were lying\r\non the snow-bed, one hardly more alive than the other.\r\n\r\nAs soon as we had recovered a little, we stumbled back amongst the sloppy\r\nsnow, and the half-hidden rocks, one of which had doubtless caused the\r\nuntimely emptying of our spirit bottle, till we arrived at the _cheminee_\r\nup which we had scrambled in the morning. Now scrambling _up_ is one thing,\r\nand scrambling _down_ is another--decidedly more difficult, particularly\r\nwith the addition of a \"beastie\" twice as large as a well-grown fawn. So we\r\ndecided to return over the small glacier which had so nearly knocked our\r\nbrains out in our ascent, not without a lurking hope of finding some water\r\nin its delicate green chalices.\r\n\r\nThe small ice-stream on which we pursued our thirsty search, flowed down\r\nfrom the upper snow-beds through a chasm in the cliffs, and lay right\r\nacross our path. The crevasses were small and easy to traverse, though had\r\nthey been ten times the breadth, we should have welcomed them for the\r\nprospect of water they held out. We soon discovered what we wanted, and\r\nthrowing ourselves on the ice, from which the sun had long since melted the\r\nlast night's snow, leaving nothing but the pure water crystal, revelled in\r\nlong draughts of ice-cold water, regardless of the consequences.\r\n\r\nWe lay there resting ourselves, and peering down the crevasses for some\r\ntime. How deliciously refreshing was that cool green light, filtered\r\nthrough the translucent ice, to our eyes, wearied by the eternal glare of\r\nthe snow-fields! I have often wondered why no poet had ever chosen one of\r\nthese same crevasses, with its tinkling stream, and fairy bridges and\r\nbattlements of pure green ice, bathing in a strange unearthly\r\nphosphorescent light, for the home of some glacier Undine. Where could one\r\nfind a fitter palace for some delicate Ariel than such places as the\r\nmoulins of the Mer de Glace, the ice-grottoes of the Grindenwald, or the\r\nRhone glacier, or even the commonest crack in the most insignificant sheet\r\nof frozen snow. How exquisitely beautiful are those little emerald basins,\r\nfit baths for Titania, filled with water so pure and clear that one almost\r\ndoubts its presence, till its exquisite coolness touches one's parched\r\nlips! I never wondered at the excitement of that enthusiastic Frenchman,\r\nwho being held by the legs to prevent him throwing himself into the arms of\r\nthe ice-nymph, whom he doubtless saw beckoning to him from below, hurled\r\nhis hat into the moulin, and then raced down to the source of the Arveiron\r\nto see it appear, hoping, doubtless, that it would bring him some tidings\r\nof fairyland. But the nymph answered not: perhaps she was cold, and\r\nretained the chapeau for her own private wearing. At all events, M. le\r\nBaron never got it again, as far as I could learn.\r\n\r\nOur labor was now nearly over; we quickly traversed two or three small\r\nsnow-fields, and after a little trouble in hauling ourselves and the gems\r\nup and down the ridges that separated them, we reached a smooth declivity\r\nof snow, down which we shot merrily, getting many a roll, it is true, but\r\nmerely laughing thereat, as every tumble carried us all the faster\r\ndownwards, and at last reached safe and sound the region of rocks and\r\ngravel we had left so long.\r\n\r\nHow deliciously refreshing to the wearied eye was the first patch of green\r\nturf!--how brightly glowed the alpen-rosen amongst the rocks! And--yes!\r\nthere is actually a honey-bee droning about that orchis, singing his\r\nwelcome song of home, and fire-sides, and kindly greetings!\r\n\r\nHappy as two school-boys, we marched on, carrying our quarry alternately,\r\nyodling, and shouting, and playing all sorts of practical jokes on each\r\nother, rejoicing at the success of our expedition, caring nothing now for\r\nthe frowns of the grim old giants around us, caring nothing for the bitter\r\nblasts and swirling snow-squalls that swept past us; and at last, as night\r\nclosed in, we found ourselves once more in the little cabin, that seemed\r\nquite home-like to us, and which we had fancied more than once in the\r\ncourse of the day that we should never see again, with Catchins gyrating\r\npound us, \"making a tail\" at the chamois, and welcoming us as old friends.\r\nWe did not dawdle long over our supper, which consisted principally of the\r\nrat-like marmot, broiled on the embers, and a draught from the neighboring\r\ntorrent, and turned into our hay beds, wet and wearied enough, with our\r\nbrains in a whirl from the strange excitements of the day, and slept, too\r\ndone up to care for tickling straws or feline impertinences.\r\n\r\nWhen I woke in the morning, I lay for some time trying to collect my\r\nthoughts, half fearing that all was but a dream, and that we had still our\r\nwork before us; but on scrambling down, the sight of the gems reassured me,\r\nand was an agreeable balm for the intolerable aching I felt from head to\r\nheel. Joseph I must say groaned quite as much as myself, and we hobbled\r\nabout in the dark to find bits of wood for our fire, like a couple of\r\nunfortunates just escaped from the rack. The skin of our faces and necks\r\nwas peeling off, as if we had been washing them in oil of vitriol, and\r\nusing sand-paper for a towel; but we were used to that, and had been as\r\nbadly burnt many a time before; but we ached!--ye gods, how we did ache! It\r\ntook a long warming and some mutually administered friction, to get us at\r\nall in walking trim. As soon as we become \"lissom\" again, having nothing to\r\ndetain us, and very little to eat, we wended on our way, one bearing\r\nCatchins in the now empty bag, and the other with the gems, down towards\r\nthe pines, covered with last night's snow, and following the course of the\r\ntorrent, strode on as merrily, or perchance more so, as the first morning\r\nwe started. The sun soon shone out bright and warm, the snow began to drip\r\nfrom the boughs, and every step we took showed the black mould and the\r\ndecaying needle leaves of the pines. We heard the rustling of several\r\nblack-cock, and it being my turn to carry Catchins' light weight, I shot\r\none villanously, as he sat on a pine branch, and stuck his tail in my hat,\r\nafter the fashion of all true yaegers.\r\n\r\nSoon we left the melting snow and dripping woods behind us, and reached the\r\nbright meadows glowing beneath an Italian sky. Strange sounded the shrill\r\nchirping of the red and green grasshoppers in our ears, kindly each\r\nherdsman's yodle and maiden's laugh rang to our hearts, and palace-like\r\nseemed the little cabin that received us after our sojourn amongst the ice\r\nand snow, now seeming more like uneasy dreams than realities which we had\r\nundergone but a day before. Bright smiles greeted us, bright brown eyes\r\nlaughed a welcome to us, and many a sturdy hand was clasped in ours as we\r\nsat resting ourselves on the bench before the door.\r\n\r\nBut we tarried not long; we burned to show our trophy \"at home;\" and we\r\nsped down the Oetzthal, and reached Dumpfen early in the afternoon, to be\r\ncheered and complimented, and welcomed back with all the warmth of the\r\nhonest Tyrolese heart. The people had been in great distress about\r\nus--about me, at least--as they supposed that I must, of necessity, have\r\nbroken my neck. I suspect, indeed, that they never thought that I would\r\nreally go, and were rather astonished when they woke, and found me gone. As\r\nfor Joseph, it was his certain fate--if not now, another time. But they\r\nrejoiced in their mistake, and with my hat crowned with flowers by many a\r\nrosy finger, and my hands tingling from many a giant squeeze, and perhaps\r\nmy heart, too, a little, from more than one gentle one, I hung my gems on a\r\nnail outside the door for inspection, and seated myself once again in the\r\nlittle chamber, looking out upon the torrent and the cliff.\r\n\r\nI cannot linger over the simple pleasures of that evening; as Shallow says,\r\n\"the heart is all.\" \"Jenkins of the _Post_\" may love to record his\r\nreminiscences of a ball at Almack's, or an \"aesthetic tea\" at the Comtesse\r\nof Cruche Casse's; but such remembrances always bring as much pain as\r\npleasure to me, making me yearn for those free days spent amongst the\r\nmountains, and the torrents, and the happy single-hearted mountaineers, far\r\nfrom the cares, troubles, and tribulations of \"our highly civilized\r\nsociety.\"\r\n\r\nAnd now, most patient reader,--are you there still? Farewell! I have tried\r\nto give you some faint description of the indescribable, and have, of\r\ncourse, failed. But take at least my advice, and a knapsack, and a thick\r\npair of shoes, and eschewing hackneyed Switzerland, leave for once the old\r\nbellwether, and try one summer in the Norischer Alpen; and if you _are_\r\ndisappointed--I can only say, that you richly deserve to be!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Chambers's Edinburgh Journal.\r\n\r\nVISIT TO THE ABERDEEN COMBWORKS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWithin our recollection, comb-making was considered one of the most\r\nmiserable of trades, and as destitute of any thing like an organized _modus\r\noperandi_ as that of the perambulating artisans who possessed a certain\r\nskill in the fashioning of rams' horns into spoons and rejoiced in the\r\nexpressive designation of Horners. On a late visit to Aberdeen, however, we\r\nfound the manufacture of combs carried on there not only to an extent far\r\nexceeding our preconceived notions, but flourishing in a state of skilful\r\norganisation; and we hastened to visit the comb-works of by far the largest\r\ncomb-maker in this country or in the world. We have no room to follow the\r\nsteps by which Aberdeen came to be the seat of this particular branch of\r\nindustry; but before describing the system of comb-making there, we shall\r\ntake a short retrospective glance at the general history of the comb, in\r\norder to illustrate the various changes it has passed through, and its\r\ngradual elevation to a respectable position in the manufactures of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to state with any degree of accuracy the time when it\r\nfirst became an indispensable requisite of the toilet; but by what we can\r\nglean from the ancient writers it would appear to have been of Egyptian\r\norigin. The Greeks and Romans used combs made of boxwood, which they\r\nobtained as we do, from the shores of the Euxine Sea, and the\r\nmountain-ridge of Cytorus, in Galatia. According to Guasco, a modern\r\nItalian author, combs were also formed of silver, iron, bronze, but in no\r\ninstance do we find the modern material, shell or horn. In addition to the\r\nwooden combs found in their tombs, it has been proved that the Egyptians\r\nhad ivory combs, toothed on one side, which gradually came into use among\r\nthe Greeks and Romans; but from specimens of the remains found at Pompeii,\r\nwith representations on the Amyclaean tables, it would seem that the Greeks,\r\nwho were remarkably studious and careful in arranging their hair, used\r\nthem, with teeth on both sides, exactly similar to our small-tooth-combs.\r\n\r\nThe mediaeval progress of the comb exhibits, like that of every thing else\r\nof its class, much curious elaboration with but little improvement in\r\nutility. In the fifteenth volume of the _Archaeologia_ there is a\r\nrepresentation of an ivory comb found in the ruins of Inkleton Nunnery,\r\nCambridgeshire, containing some Anglo-Saxon design exquisitely carved in\r\nrelief, but with such teeth as a common boor in our day would treat with\r\ncontempt. We find Chaucer commenting on the many absurd articles of female\r\nattire, at a time when both sexes tied up their hair in a \"licorous\r\nfashion\" with ivory pins; and one of the earliest specimens of English\r\ncombs extant, was dug up in 1764 from beneath the lowest of the three paved\r\nstreets, which lie--memorials of their several ages--under the present\r\nShiprow Street of Aberdeen; and it was supposed to have lain there ever\r\nsince Edward III. burned and ruined the city in 1336.\r\n\r\nIn modern days the comb probably reached its most costly and ornamental\r\nstate at the court of Louis XIV., where hair-dressing was an art more\r\nappreciated and often better paid than the higher efforts of genius. Combs\r\nof ivory and of tortoise-shell, richly inlaid with gold and pearl, formed\r\nan essential adjunct of the toilet of the court beauties. In Great Britain\r\nthe fabrication of horn into combs was a very ancient process, chiefly in\r\nYorkshire and the midland counties. But towards the end of the last century\r\nthe increased demand for combs caused makers to establish themselves all\r\nover the country; and in Scotland there were one or two houses of some\r\neminence in the trade at the period--some twenty-five years back--at which\r\nwe have now arrived. It was, however, one of those trades that, as its\r\nartificers were concerned, would not stand investigation. Making combs on\r\nnearly the same principles as those pursued by their forefathers--that is,\r\nby simply cutting out the interspace between the teeth, with various sorts\r\nand sizes of saws--its followers, barely entitled to the name of skilled\r\nworkmen, were dissipated, unsettled, and irregular in their habits.\r\n\r\nWe come now to treat of the grand era in the comb trade--of the time when\r\nit was destined, like the great staple manufactures of our country, to\r\nundergo a revolution. The introduction of machinery and steam-power, with\r\nthe division of labor, is suggestive of an important stride in the progress\r\nof the trade. About the year 1828 Mr. Lynn invented a machine of a\r\nsingularly ingenious design, having for its principal object that of\r\ncutting two combs out of one plate of horn or shell; and two years\r\nafterwards Stewart, Rowell & Co. commenced the manufacture in Aberdeen. To\r\nthe first of these circumstances the trade was indebted for the successful\r\nidea of a machine, which affected at the same time a saving of half the\r\nmaterial, and an increase of produce almost inconceivable. To the latter it\r\nis still more indebted for the first application of steam-power to the\r\nmachinery; and, what we think of infinitely greater importance, the\r\nintroduction of those true principles in the philosophy of production\r\ncontended for by Adam Smith--a philosophy which, in its legitimate\r\napplication, has the invariable effect of elevating alike the character of\r\nthe produce and the producers.\r\n\r\nWe shall most appropriately represent the combined effect of these\r\nimprovements on the trade by taking the reader along with us in a cursory\r\nview of the principal departments of the Aberdeen Combworks. Provided with\r\nan intelligent cicerone in the person of one of the clerks of the office,\r\nwe began our investigations, and as an essential preliminary, were first\r\nshown specimens of the various kinds of raw material. In the order of its\r\nintrinsic value, this consists of tortoise-shells, horns, and hoofs. Ivory,\r\nin our day, is reserved almost exclusively for the manufacture of\r\nsmall-tooth combs, which form a branch of the ivory trade distinct from the\r\none before us. Of the first of these materials, tortoise-shell, that best\r\nadapted to manufacturing purposes is the shell, or scales of a horny\r\ncontexture which inclose the sea-tortoise, _Testudo imbricata_. It is found\r\nin all warm latitudes; but the best species are indigenous to Hindostan,\r\nthe Indian Archipelago, and the shores of the Red Sea. The price we are apt\r\nto think excessive. At present it is thirty-five shillings per pound, and\r\nten years ago it was nearly double that price. It forms however a valuable\r\narticle of importation. There are two chief divisions in horn, buffalo and\r\nox horns, both of which are imported from various parts of the globe.\r\nBuffalo horn is for the most part used in the manufacture of knife-handles,\r\nand such articles, in the cutlery trade. In comb-making it is chiefly used\r\nfor dressing-combs, and, generally speaking, all combs of a deep black\r\ncolor are formed of this material. The best buffalo-horns are obtained from\r\nthe East Indies, and the finest are those of the Indian buffalo from Siam.\r\nWe were shown a beautiful specimen of Siamese horns, which, on account of\r\ntheir extraordinary dimensions, had been preserved and polished. One of\r\nthem measured five feet from tip to base, eighteen and a half inches in\r\ncircumference at the widest part, and weighed fourteen pounds. Some\r\nconception may be formed of the size of an animal which can support such a\r\nweight on the frontal-bone, if we recollect that an English ox-horn weighs\r\nonly a single pound.\r\n\r\nOx-horns, the staple of comb-makers, are imported with hides from South\r\nAmerica, the Cape of Good Hope, and New South Wales. The imports, however,\r\nare chiefly from the enormous herds of South American black-cattle, which\r\nhave multiplied to such an extent in the Brazilian territories, that they\r\nare now slaughtered for the sake of their hides and horns, and their\r\ncarcasses left to be devoured by the innumerable carnivorous animals which\r\ninfest the jungles. The ox-horns entered for consumption in Great Britain\r\nin 1850 numbered 1,250,000, and the average price is about fifty pounds per\r\nton.\r\n\r\nHoofs are from the German and home markets, and are worth about twelve\r\npounds per ton. They are used generally in the cheapest description of\r\ncombs, but although the least valuable material, are subject to the most\r\ncostly and ingenious processes of manufacture.\r\n\r\nAt the time of our visit the quantity of horns and hoofs in stock amounted\r\nto upwards of one hundred tons of each. Enormous piles of different\r\nvarieties--from the delicate curvature of the small Highland ox to the\r\nequally beautiful but enormous _cornu_ of the ferocious buffalo of the\r\nCape; from the Smithfield horns to those of the gigantic buffalo of Thibet\r\nand Siam--all lay piled in inextricable confusion.\r\n\r\nAfter a glance at the steam-engine, fifty horse-power, and the largest of\r\nthe horizontal kind in Scotland, we proceeded to see the first stage of the\r\nmanufacture, where horns are cut into assorted sizes by a circular saw. A\r\nhorn is twice cut transversely, and afterwards, if a large one,\r\nlongitudinally. The tips or extremities here cut off are sent to Sheffield,\r\nwhere they are converted into table-knife and umbrella handles; and for\r\nthis purpose sixteen thousand horns can be cut up in a week. Instead of\r\nbeing divided in this manner, the hoofs are, after being boiled a certain\r\ntime, to render the fibre soft, cut into two pieces; or rather the sole is\r\nstamped out by vertical punching-machines of the same irregular\r\nconformation.\r\n\r\nThe horns and hoofs thus cut are then brought in pieces into the pressing\r\ndepartment. The first thing that strikes the visitor on entering is the\r\npeculiar and easily distinguishable odor of burnt horn, which indeed is\r\npredominant throughout the works. This arises from the high temperature\r\nnecessary to the fabrication of horn, which to a greater or less extent\r\neffects decomposition of the material, and is invariably accompanied with\r\nthe disengagement of the peculiar gases which create the odor. Along the\r\nfloor of this department are thirty-six furnaces of a peculiar\r\nconstruction, and at each of these a man and boy were busily engaged in\r\nshaping the cut horns into flat plates, by heating the pieces, and then\r\ncutting them to the required shape with knives. They were then inserted\r\nbetween screw-blocks, and pressed flat. If, however, the plates are\r\nrequired for stained combs, as the greater part of them are, a different\r\nmode of pressing is pursued. Into a rectangular cast-iron trough about two\r\nand a half feet long by twelve inches wide and deep, a number of iron\r\nhot-plates are put; they are then oiled on their surface, and the plates of\r\nhorn inserted between them; a wedge is next driven into the press by the\r\npercussion-force of a weight falling eight feet, producing a force of about\r\none hundred and twenty tons. This pressure on the horn in the iron plates\r\nhas the effect of breaking the fibre to a certain degree, and forcing it to\r\nexpand in a lateral direction. Whatever may have been the original color of\r\nthe horn, it is now of a uniform dark green color, and perfectly soft. This\r\ntreatment renders the tissues more pervious to the action of acids, and\r\nwill be better understood when we arrive at the operation of staining.\r\n\r\nBut there are other means of pressure. Around the apartment were arranged\r\none hundred and twenty iron screw-presses--levers of the second order, and\r\ndiffering only from a common vice in pressing under the screw after the\r\nmanner of nut-crackers. They are fitted with steel dies, with a variety of\r\nengraved designs, and in these braid-combs, the outside coverings of\r\npocket-combs and side-combs are pressed. We were shown a new impression on\r\npocket-combs of the Crystal Palace. A man exerting his strength on one of\r\nthese presses can produce a force of upwards of fifty tons. But however\r\ngreat, the pressure is still insufficient. The enormous demand for the\r\ncheap side-combs of hoof led to the application of hydraulic pressure. The\r\ntwo portions of the hoof, after being boiled a second time in a number of\r\nlittle troughs, with a steam-jet in each of them to preserve the necessary\r\ntemperature, the excrescences still adhering are pared off. They are then\r\ntransferred to an adjoining room, where sixteen hydraulic presses, are in\r\noperation; and here are subjected to a pressure of three hundred tons, with\r\na degree of speed and precision that is astonishing. They come out of the\r\npress in the form of small, semi-transparent, rectangular plates, having on\r\neach side the rounded projection or beading observable on most side-combs.\r\nTo illustrate the resistless force of this pressure, we were informed that\r\nthe very steel dies which give shape to the hoof are soon crushed and worn\r\nout; and it was not without some nice calculation and experiment that the\r\napplication of hydraulic pressure to the purpose was successfully attained.\r\nAfter having received the necessary formation by the various modes of\r\npressing, the plates are laid aside to dry in a room where a high\r\ntemperature is preserved by means of steam-pipes, and where they are also\r\nassorted into different sizes, and the edges squared with circular saws.\r\nThe number of such plates, of shell, horn, and hoof, in stock at the time\r\nof our visit, was somewhere about four millions and a half.\r\n\r\nFrom this they are distributed to the different processes in order--the\r\nfirst of which is cutting the teeth. Certain classes of horn-plates,\r\nhowever, are subjected to a farther process of planing on the surface\r\npreliminary to this operation; but in all plates which have been\r\nhot-pressed, and are intended to be stained, this is unnecessary, and\r\ntherefore they are taken when perfectly dry to the cutting department. On\r\nentering this department the visitor is sometimes bewildered. The incessant\r\nand peculiar clatter of the machinery, the heat of the place, and apparent\r\nconfusion, produce together a curious effect. A little observation,\r\nhowever, shows that we have arrived at the basis of all the modern\r\nimprovements in comb-making. On benches around the apartment, in close\r\nproximity to each other, were twenty-four \"twinning-machines\"--the\r\ninvention, with its subsequent improvements, to which we have referred.\r\nEach of these is worked by a man, with an attendant who keeps up a supply\r\nof hot plates from the fires arranged for that purpose in the centre of the\r\nroom. It is impossible without diagrams to explain the principles and\r\nconstruction of this apparatus; but there can be no mistaking its effect. A\r\nplate of horn, after being heated, is placed on a small carriage within the\r\ncast-iron frame of the machine, which travels by means of a particular\r\narrangement of gearing on parallel slides. Immediately over this are two\r\nangular-shaped chisel-like cutters, which, on the application of motive\r\npower, descend on the horn with an alternating motion, and an inconceivable\r\ndegree of rapidity and force. Before we could well see, far less\r\nunderstand, the rationale of the process, we were shown the horn cut in two\r\npieces--_one half literally taken out of the other_, and each presenting\r\nthe well-defined outline of a comb. In this cutting department resides the\r\nperfection of that beautiful mechanism that revolutionized the trade and\r\nreduced it to mathematical precision. To appreciate this we have only to\r\nlook at the increase it has effected in the production. A comb-maker of the\r\nold school could not perhaps, with all his skill, cut more than eighty or a\r\nhundred combs per day; while with this machinery a man and boy will cut\r\nupwards of _two thousand_ of the same kind, and with a consumption of only\r\nhalf the material. The finer dressing-combs, and all small-tooth combs, are\r\nstill cut by circular saws in the next department. Here, however, a\r\nmoderately curious visitor will not linger. A dense atmosphere of horn dust\r\nfills the large apartment, and gives to every thing within its influence\r\nthe white appearance that distinguishes a flour-mill, to which indeed at\r\nfirst sight it bears a striking resemblance. From the notes we took, we\r\nlearn that here there are wheels on the fine self-acting machinery, in\r\nconnection with the cutting and pointing of combs, that revolve 5000 times\r\nin a minute, and saws so delicately fine as to cut forty teeth within the\r\nspace of an inch.\r\n\r\nWe inquired as to the effect on the operatives of this animalized\r\natmosphere, and were informed that it was not known to be injurious. On\r\nthe contrary, it was stated as a singular fact, in connection with the late\r\nvisitation of cholera in Aberdeen, that not a single comb-maker had been\r\naffected by the disease, at least fatally; whence it may be inferred,\r\nalthough we do not pretend to assign the reason, that the fabrication of\r\nhorn must be attended with considerable anti-miasmatic effects. At all\r\nevents it is certain that horn-dust cannot exercise that injurious action\r\non the air-passages and the lungs which is experienced in many trades, such\r\nas that of the steel-grinders of Sheffield.\r\n\r\nPassing over one or two intermediate stages after the combs are thus cut\r\nand twinned--such as \"thinning\" on the outer edge by means of grindstones,\r\nand \"pointing,\" by means of peculiarly-shaped bevel-saws--we arrive at the\r\nnext department, where the finishing is given by the hand. Here we meet\r\nwith artificers who, with a pertinacious reverence for ancient usages,\r\npreserve among themselves the appellation of comb-makers _par excellence_,\r\nforgetting that the very boys and girls in their respective departments\r\nplay as important a part in the aggregate production. And yet, in their\r\nprovince, they are deserving of commendation. The specimens of elaborate\r\nand skilful decoration displayed here, especially on ladies' braid-combs,\r\nwere admirable, and one pattern was shown us wherein there was a species of\r\nchain, formed of beautifully stained horn, woven with the head of the comb,\r\nwhich, although we examined it minutely, and knew there must have been a\r\njoint in each alternate link, we nevertheless failed to discover. It is in\r\nthis department that the teeth are smoothed and rounded--an operation\r\ntechnically termed \"grailling\"--which is effected by different sorts of\r\ncutting rasps. So far as the making or formation is concerned, the combs\r\nare now finished.\r\n\r\nAt the opposite side of the buildings we were taken to the department where\r\nthe staining is carried on. This will be better understood if described as\r\nthe imitation on the various classes of combs of the natural diversity of\r\ntint in tortoise-shell. The horn, whether in plates, as in the side-combs,\r\nor after being \"twinned,\" as in dressing-combs, is immersed in diluted\r\nnitric acid, which, with its characteristic action on all organized\r\ntissues, creates a deep and permanent yellow stain. This resembles the\r\nground color of tortoise-shell; and to produce the variegation, the horns\r\nare then treated with a particular composition of red oxide of lead, with\r\ncertain alkaline compounds, which has the effect of neutralizing the action\r\nof the acid, and imprinting a stain of a deep orange color. After being\r\ncarefully washed, dried, and polished, the surface of the combs presents\r\nthe beautiful and natural appearance desired. Indeed, the imitation is so\r\nperfect in the best classes of stained combs, that a practised observer can\r\nonly detect it. We were shown, for example, two specimens of braid-combs,\r\none of real tortoise-shell and another of stained horn; and so much alike\r\nwere they in color and configuration, that we could not tell which was\r\nwhich, and yet the one comb was worth about ten times as much as the other.\r\nThis operation of staining, which is somewhat artistic, is performed by\r\nwomen.\r\n\r\nThere are still some minor departments, which we need not describe in\r\ndetail. \"Buffing\" consists in smoothing the rough surfaces of the horn by\r\nmeans of wheels covered with walrus skin. Side-combs and braids are bent to\r\ntheir peculiar curve by being first heated and then fastened to wooden\r\nblocks--an operation that lasts only a few minutes. Pocket-combs have of\r\ncourse a different and peculiar treatment in some stages; such as the\r\nformation of the joint, and the putting together of the handles. And there\r\nis a department exclusively devoted to the fabrication of horn-spoons,\r\nwhich becomes chiefly remarkable from the circumstance of there being no\r\nmodern application of machinery to the manufacture. The last process,\r\nhowever, to which all combs are subjected, is that of polishing, which is\r\neffected by wheels, covered with leather of different degrees of softness.\r\nAfter this they are despatched to the warehouse, to be assorted the last\r\ntime--the side-combs being stitched to cards, or packed in fancy boxes,\r\nwhich affords constant work to about twenty women.\r\n\r\nWe were finally shown the patterns of the different kinds of combs, many of\r\nthem exceedingly beautiful; but we can only notice them in regard to\r\nnumber. Of dressing-combs (counting the different sizes of all the\r\npatterns), there were 605; ladies' braid-combs, 612; ladies' side-combs,\r\n525; pocket, small-tooth, horse combs, and sundry articles, 186: in all,\r\n1928 different varieties.\r\n\r\nThe aggregate number produced of all these different sorts averages upwards\r\nof 1200 gross weekly, or about 9,000,000 annually. The annual consumption\r\nof ox-horns is about 730,000, being considerably more than half the imports\r\nof 1850; the consumption of hoofs amounts to 4,000,000; the consumption of\r\ntortoise-shell and buffalo-horn, although not so large, is correspondingly\r\nvaluable: even the waste, composed of horn-shavings and parings of hoof,\r\nwhich, from its nitrogenized composition, becomes valuable in the\r\nmanufacture of prussiate of potash, amounts to 350 tons in the year; the\r\nbroken combs in the various stages of manufacture average 50 or 60 gross in\r\na week; and as the crowning illustration of the enormous extent of these\r\ncomb-works, the very paper for packing costs L.600 a year.\r\n\r\nThere are so many beautiful instances of the division of labor that the\r\ntask of selecting is not easy. But let us take the cheapest article in the\r\ntrade; namely, the side-combs, sold retail at 1d. per pair: in its\r\nprogress from the hoof to the comb--finished, carded, and labelled \"German\r\nshell\"--it undergoes eleven distinct operations. This comb, which twenty\r\nyears ago was sold to the trade at 3s. 6d. per dozen, can now be purchased\r\nin the same way for _two shillings and sixpence per gross!_ thus effecting\r\na reduction in price of about 1600 per cent. As an illustration of the\r\nvalue of labor, we give the following comparative estimate of the produce\r\nof the three materials:----\r\n\r\n1 cwt. shell, val. L.200, produces combs, val. 275, inc. 37-1/2 per cent.\r\n1 ton horns,   \"      56,     \"      \"     \"   150,  \"   168      \"    \"\r\n1 ton hoofs,   \"      12,     \"      \"     \"    36,  \"   200      \"    \"\r\n\r\nRegarded in this aspect, in the relation of labor to material, we find that\r\nhoofs--intrinsically the least valuable of the materials--become, with the\r\napplication of labor, the _most valuable_--that is, proportionably: and the\r\nconverse is true in the case of tortoise-shell.\r\n\r\nAt the time of our visit there were employed 456 men and boys, and 164\r\nwomen--in all, 620 persons--exactly four times the number employed in the\r\ncomb-trade in all Scotland when the house commenced business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the National Era.\r\n\r\nA REMINISCENCE.\r\n\r\nBY ALICE CAREY.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome four or five years ago, there came to reside in the neighborhood in\r\nwhich I then lived a family consisting of three persons--an old lady, a\r\nyoung man, and a child of some fourteen years. The cottage they took was\r\ndivided by a little strip of woods from my own home; and I well remember\r\nhow rejoiced I was on first seeing the blue smoke curling up from the high\r\nred chimneys, for the house had been a long time vacant, and the prospect\r\nof having near neighbors gave me delight. Perhaps, too, I was not the less\r\npleased that they were new neighbors. We are likely to under-estimate\r\npersons and things we have continually about us; but let separation come,\r\nand we learn what they were to us. _Apropos_ of this--in the little grove I\r\nhave spoken of I remember there was an oak tree, taller by a great deal\r\nthan its fellows; and a thousand times I have felt as though its mates must\r\nbe oppressed with a painful sense of degradation, and really wished the axe\r\nwere laid at its root. At last, one day I heard the ringing strokes of that\r\nfatal instrument, and, on inquiry, was told that the woodman had received\r\norders no longer to _spare that tree_. Eagerly I listened at first--every\r\nstroke was like the song of victory; then the gladness subsided, and I\r\nbegan to marvel how the woods would look with the monarch fallen; then I\r\nthought, the glory will have departed, and began to reflect on myself as\r\nhaving sealed its death warrant, so that when the crash, telling that the\r\nmighty was fallen, woke the sleeping echoes from the hills, I cannot tell\r\nhow sad an echo it waked also in my heart. If I could see it standing once\r\nmore, just once more! but I could not, and till this day I feel a twinge\r\nwhen I think of the tall oak.\r\n\r\nBut the new neighbors. Some curiosity mingled with my pleasure, I confess,\r\nand so, as soon as I thought they were settled, and feeling at home, I made\r\nmy toilet with unusual care for the first call.\r\n\r\nThe cottage was somewhat back from the main road, and access to it was had\r\nby a narrow grass-grown lane, bordered on one side by a green belt of\r\nmeadow land, and on the other by the grove, sloping upward and backward to\r\na clayey hill, where, with children and children's children, about them,\r\n\r\n    \"The rude forefathers of the hamlet slept.\"\r\n\r\nA little farther on, but in full view of its stunted cypresses and white\r\nheadstones, was the cottage. Of burial grounds generally I have no dread,\r\nbut from this particular one I was accustomed, even from a child, to turn\r\naway with something of superstitious horror. I could never forget how Laura\r\nHastings saw a light burning there all one winter night, after the death of\r\nJohn Hine, a wild, roving fellow, who never did any real harm in his life\r\nto any one but himself, hastening his own death by foolish excesses.\r\nNevertheless, his ghost had been seen more than once, sitting on the cold\r\nclay mound beneath which the soul's expression was fading and crumbling\r\ninto dust--so, at least, said some of the oldest and most pious inhabitants\r\nof our village. There, too, Mary Wildermings, a fair young girl who died,\r\nmore sinned against than sinning, had been heard to sing sad lullabies\r\nunder the waning moon sometimes, and at other times had been sitting by her\r\nsunken grave, and braiding roses, as for a bridal, in her hair. True, I\r\nnever saw any of these wonderful things; but a spot more likely to be\r\nhaunted by the unresting spirits of the bad could not readily be imagined.\r\nThe woods, thick and full of birds, along the roadside, thinned away toward\r\nthe desolate ridge, where briers grew over the grave-mounds, and about and\r\nthrough the fallen palings, as they would, with here and there a little\r\nclearing among weeds and thistles and high matted grass, for the making of\r\na new bed.\r\n\r\nIt was the twilight of a beautiful summer day as I walked down the grassy\r\nlane and past the lonesome graveyard to make my first call at the cottage,\r\nfeeling, I scarcely knew why, strangely sad. By an old broken bridge in the\r\nhollow between the cottage and the graveyard I remember that I sat down,\r\nand for a long time listened to the trickling of the water over the\r\npebbles, and watched the golden patches of sunlight till they quite faded\r\nout as \"came still evening on, and twilight gray, that in her sober livery\r\nall things clad.\"\r\n\r\nSo quietly I sat that the mole, beginning its blind work at sunset,\r\nloosened and stirred the ground beneath my feet, and the white,\r\nthick-winged moths, coming from beneath the dusty weeds, fluttered about\r\nme, and lighted in my lap, and the dull, flabby beating of the bat came\r\nalmost in my face.\r\n\r\nThe first complaint of the owl sounded along the hollow and died over the\r\nnext hill, warning me to proceed, when I heard, as it were the echo of my\r\nown thought, repeated in a low, melancholy voice, the conclusion of that\r\nbeautiful stanza of the elegy in reference to that moping bird. I\r\ndistinctly caught the lines----\r\n\r\n    \"Of such as wandering near her sacred bower,\r\n    Molest her ancient solitary reign.\"\r\n\r\nLooking up, I saw approaching slowly, with arms folded and eyes upon the\r\nground, a young and seemingly exceeding handsome man. He passed without\r\nnoticing me at all, and I think without seeing me. As he did not observe\r\nme, I had the better opportunity of observing him, though I would fain have\r\nforegone that privilege to have won one glance. He interested me, and I\r\nfelt humiliated that he should pass me as though I were a stick or a stone.\r\nHis face was pale and very sad, and his forehead shaded with a mass of\r\nblack, heavy hair, pushed away from one temple, and falling neglectedly\r\nover the other.\r\n\r\n\"Well!\" said I, as I watched him ascending the opposite hill, feeling very\r\nmuch as though he had wantonly slighted some claim I had upon him, though I\r\ncould not possibly have the slightest, and, turning ill-humoredly away, I\r\nwalked with a quick step toward the cottage.\r\n\r\nA golden-haired young girl sat in the window reading, and on my approach\r\narose and received me with easy gracefulness and well-bred courtesy, but\r\nduring my stay her manner did not once border upon cordiality. She was very\r\nbeautiful, but her beauty was like that of statuary. The mother I did not\r\nsee. She was, as I was told, slightly indisposed, and, on begging that she\r\nmight not be disturbed, the daughter readily acquiesced. Every thing about\r\nthe place indicated people accustomed to refined and elegant habits, but\r\nwhence they came, how long they proposed to remain, and what relation the\r\nyoung man sustained to the other members of the family I confess I would\r\ngladly have known.\r\n\r\nSeeing a flute on the table, I spoke of music, for I conceived it to belong\r\nto the absent gentleman. I received no enlightenment, however; and as the\r\ntwilight was already falling deeply, I felt obliged to take leave, without\r\nobtaining even a glimpse of the person whom I had pictured in imagination\r\nas young and fair, and of course agreeable.\r\n\r\nThe sun had been set some time, but the moon had risen full and bright, so\r\nthat I felt no fear even in passing the graveyard, but walked more slowly\r\nthan I had done before, till, reaching the gate, I paused to think of the\r\nawful mystery of life and death and immortality.\r\n\r\nThis is not a very desolate spot after all, thought I, as leaning over the\r\ngate, something of the quiet of the place infused itself into my spirits.\r\nHere, I felt, the wicked cease from troubling, and the weary are at rest.\r\nHere the long train of evils that attach themselves to the best phases of\r\nhumanity fade to silent dust. Here the thorn-crown of pain is loosened from\r\nthe brow of sorrow by the white hand of peace, and the hearts that were all\r\ntheir lifetime bowed under the shadow of a great and haply unpitied\r\naffliction, never ache any more. And here, oh, best of all, the frailties\r\nof the unresisting tempted are folded away beneath the shroud from the\r\nhumiliating glances of pity--from the cold eyes of pride. We have need to\r\nbe thankful that when man brought upon his primal nature the mildew of sin,\r\nGod did not cast us utterly from him, but in the unsearchable riches of his\r\nmercy struck open the refuge of the grave. If there were no fountain where\r\nour sins of scarlet might be washed as white as wool--if the black night of\r\ndeath were not bordered by the golden shadows of the morning of\r\nimmortality--if deep in the darkness were not sunken the foundations of the\r\nwhite bastions of peace--it were yet an inestimable privilege to lay aside\r\nthe burden of life, for life becomes--sooner or later, a burden, an echo\r\namong ruins.\r\n\r\nIn the corner of the burial ground, where the trees are thickest, a little\r\napart from the rest, was the grave of Mary Wildermings, and year after year\r\nthe blue thistles bloomed and faded in its sunken sod.\r\n\r\nThe train of my reflections naturally suggested her, and, turning my eyes\r\nin the direction of her resting place, I saw, or thought I saw, the outline\r\nof a human figure. I remembered the story of her unresting ghost, and at\r\nfirst little doubted that I beheld it, and felt, I own, a tumult of strange\r\nfeeling on finding myself thus alone so near a questionable shape.\r\n\r\nThen, I said, this is some delusion of the senses; and I passed my hand\r\nover my eyes, for an uncertain glimmer had followed my intensity of gaze. I\r\nlooked towards the cottage to reassure myself by the light of a human\r\nhabitation, but all there was dark--a cloud had passed over the moon, and,\r\nwithout venturing to look towards the haunted grave, I withdrew from the\r\ngate, very lightly; nevertheless, it creaked as I did so. Any sound save\r\nthe beating of my own heart gave me courage; and when I had walked a little\r\nway, I turned and looked again, but the dense shadow would have prevented\r\nmy seeing any thing, if any thing had been there. Certain it is, I saw\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\nOn returning home, I asked the housekeeper, a garrulous person usually, if\r\nshe remembered Mary Wildermings, and if she was not buried in the graveyard\r\nacross the wood.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I remember her, and she is buried in the corner of the ground on the\r\nhill. They come to my house, I know, to get a cup, or something of the\r\nsort, with which to dip the water from her grave, for it rained terribly\r\nall the day of her funeral. But,\" she added, \"what do you want to talk of\r\nthe dead and gone for, when there are living folks enough to talk about?\"\r\n\r\nTruth is, she wanted me to say something of our new neighbors, and was\r\nvexed that I did not, though I probably should have done so had they not\r\nbeen quite driven from my thoughts by the more absorbing event of the\r\nevening; so, as much vexed and disappointed as herself, I retired. The\r\nnight was haunted with some troublous dreams, but a day of sunshine\r\nsucceeded, and my thoughts flowed back to a more cheerful channel.\r\n\r\nDays and weeks went by, and we neither saw nor heard anything of our new\r\nneighbors, for my call was not returned, nor did I make any further\r\novertures towards an acquaintance.\r\n\r\nOften, as I sat under the apple tree by the door, of twilights, I heard the\r\nsweet mellow music of the flute.\r\n\r\n\"Is that at the cottage?\" said the housekeeper to me, one night: \"it sounds\r\nto me as though it were in the corner of the graveyard.\"\r\n\r\nI smiled as she turned her head a little to one side, and, encircling the\r\nright ear with her hand, listened for some minutes eagerly, and then\r\nproceeded to express her conviction that the music was the result of no\r\nmortal agency.\r\n\r\n\"Did you ever hear of a ghost playing the flute?\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"A flute!\" she answered, indignantly, \"it's a flute, just as much as you\r\nare a flute; and for the sake of enlightening your blind understanding,\r\nI'll go to the graveyard, night as it is, if you will go with me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" I said. \"Come on.\"\r\n\r\nSo, under the faint light of the crescent moon, we took our way together.\r\nGradually the notes became lower and sadder, and quite died away. I urged\r\nmy trembling companion to walk faster, lest the ghost should vanish too;\r\nand she acceded to my wish with silent alacrity, that convinced me at once\r\nof the sincerity of her expressed belief.\r\n\r\nJust as we began to ascend the hill, she stopped suddenly, saying,\r\n\r\n\"There! did you hear that?\"\r\n\r\nI answered that I heard a noise, but that it was no unusual thing to hear\r\nsounds of the sort in an inhabited neighborhood at so early an hour.\r\n\r\nIt was the latching of the gate at the graveyard. She answered, solemnly.\r\n\r\n\"As you value your immortal soul, go no further.\"\r\n\r\nIn vain I argued, that a ghost would have no need to unlatch the gate. She\r\npositively refused to go farther, and with a courage not very habitual to\r\nme, I confess, I walked on alone.\r\n\r\n\"Do you think I don't know that sound?\" she called after me. \"I would know\r\nif I had forgotten everything else. Oh, stop till I tell you! The night\r\nMary Wildermings died,\" I heard her say; but I knew the sound of the gate\r\nas well as she, and would not wait even for a ghost story. I have since\r\nwished I had, for I could never afterwards persuade her to reveal it.\r\n\r\nGaining the summit of the hill, I perceived, a little way before me, a dark\r\nfigure, receding slowly; but so intent was I on the superhuman, that I paid\r\nlittle attention to the human; though afterward, in recalling the\r\ncircumstance, the individual previously seen while I sat on the bridge\r\nbecame in some way associated with this.\r\n\r\nHow hushed and solemn the graveyard seemed! I was half afraid, as I looked\r\nin--quite startled, in fact, when latching and unlatching the gate, to\r\ndetermine whether the sound I had heard were that or not, a rabbit, roused\r\nfrom its light sleep, under the fallen grass, sped fleetly across the still\r\nmounds to the safer shelter of the woods. I saw nothing else, save that the\r\ngrass was trampled to a narrow path leading towards Mary's grave.\r\n\r\nDuring the summer, I sometimes saw the young girl in the woods, and I\r\nnoticed that she neither gathered flowers nor sang with the birds; but\r\nwould sit for hours in some deep shadow, without moving her position in the\r\nleast, not even to push away the light curls which the wind blew over her\r\ncheeks and forehead, as they would. She seemed to neither love nor seek\r\nhuman companionship. Once only I noticed, and it was the last time she ever\r\nwalked in the woods, that he whom I supposed to be her brother was with\r\nher. She did not sit in the shade, as usual, but walked languidly, and\r\nleaning heavily on the arm of her attendant, who several times swept off\r\nthe curls from her forehead, and bent down, as if kissing her.\r\n\r\nA few days afterwards, being slightly indisposed, I called in the village\r\ndoctor. Our conversation, naturally enough, was of who was sick and who was\r\ndead.\r\n\r\n\"Among my patients,\" he said, \"there is none that interests me so deeply as\r\na little girl at the cottage--indeed, I have scarcely thought of anything\r\nelse, since I knew that she must die. A strange child,\" he continued; \"she\r\nseems to feel neither love of life nor fear of death--nor does she either\r\nweep or smile; and though I have been with her much of late, I have never\r\nseen her sleep. She suffers no pain--her face wears the same calm\r\nexpression, but her large, melancholy eyes are wide open all the time.\"\r\n\r\nThe second evening after this, though not quite recovered myself, I called\r\nat the cottage, in the hope of being of some service to the sick girl. The\r\nsnowy curtain was dropped over the window of her chamber--the sash partly\r\nraised, and all within still--very still. The door was a little open, and,\r\npausing, I heard from within a low, stifled moan, which I could not\r\nmisunderstand, and pushing open the door, I entered without rapping.\r\n\r\nIn the white sheet, drawn straight over the head and the feet, I recognised\r\nat once the fearful truth--the little girl was dead. By the head of the\r\nbed, and still as one stricken into stone, sat the personage I so often\r\nwished to see. The room was shadowy, and his face buried in his\r\nhands--nevertheless, I knew him--it was he who had passed me on the bridge.\r\n\r\nPresently the housekeeper, or one that I took to be she, entered, and\r\nwhispering to him, he arose and left the room, so that I but imperfectly\r\nsaw him. When he was gone, the woman folded the covering away from the\r\nface, and to my horror I saw that the eyes were still unclosed. Seeing my\r\nsurprise, she said, as she folded a napkin, and pinned it close over the\r\nshut lids----\r\n\r\n\"It is strange, but the child would never in life close her eyes--her\r\nmother, they say, died in watching for one who never came, and the baby was\r\nwatchful and sleepless from the first.\"\r\n\r\nThe next day, and the next, it was dull and rainy--excitement and premature\r\nexposure had induced a return of my first indisposition, so that I was not\r\nat the funeral. I saw, however, from my window, preparations for the\r\nburial--to my surprise, in the lonesome little graveyard by the woods.\r\n\r\nIn the course of a fortnight, I prepared for a visit of condolence to the\r\ncottage, but, on reaching it, found the inhabitants gone--the place still\r\nand empty.\r\n\r\nOn my return, I stopped at the haunted burial ground--close by the grave of\r\nMary Wildermings was that of the stranger child. The briers and thistles\r\nhad been carefully cut away, there was no slab and no name over either, but\r\nthe blue and white violets were planted thickly about both. That they slept\r\nwell, was all I knew.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Household Words.\r\n\r\nTHE SHADOW OF MARGERY PASTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nA suggestive book, \"The Paston Letters; Original Letters, written during\r\nthe reigns of Henry the Sixth, Edward the Fourth, and Richard the Third:\"\r\nthe private history of a family of rank, some four centuries ago. In this\r\ncollection of ancient memorials of domestic life, we trace the nature of\r\nthe contests between themselves of a poor, ambitious, and turbulant\r\naristocracy, when the right of the strong arm was paramount over law; we\r\nsee the growth of that power which was derived from the profitable exercise\r\nof industry; and view the middle classes, amidst the partial oppression and\r\ngeneral contempt of the high-born, securing for themselves a firm position\r\nand a strong hold, whilst the exclusive claims of feudality were crumbling\r\naround them. Here we learn how harsh were many of the domestic relations of\r\nparent and child--how public oppression had its counterpart in private\r\ntyranny. The love passages of the book are singularly interesting. A humble\r\nfriend of the Paston family has won the affections of one of its daughters.\r\nThey are betrothed. The mother insults the \"Factor.\" The brothers despise\r\nhim. The power of the Church is opposed to the union. Yet the ardent girl\r\nis constant--and she triumphs. How she finally emerged from her\r\npersecutions is not recorded. But the last letter of the angry mother,\r\nwhich describes these struggles, is thus endorsed:--\"A letter to Sir John\r\nPaston from his mother, touching the good-will between her daughter Margery\r\nP. and Ric. Calle, who were after married together.\"\r\n\r\nThe shadows of the young lady and her lover arise before us, and we try to\r\npiece out their dim history.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMargery Paston is sitting in the accustomed solitude of the Brown chamber\r\nin her mother's dowry house at Norwich. Dame Margaret Paston, her mother,\r\nhas just returned from spending the Easter of 1469 in her son's ruinous\r\ncastle of Caister. He holds this castle under a disputed will; and the\r\ngreat duke of Norfolk is preparing to dispossess him of it, not by the\r\nfeeble writs of the King's Court at Westminster, but by gun and scaling\r\nladder. On the return of the lady she receives unwelcome intelligence. Her\r\nchaplin, Sir James Gloys, has intercepted a letter addressed to her\r\ndaughter. The young lady is the object of constant anxiety and\r\nsuspicion--watched--persecuted. Up to the age of twelve or fourteen she had\r\nseen little of her parents, but had been a welcome inmate in the family of\r\nSir John Fastolf, at Caister; who, in his caresses of the fair girl,\r\nindulged the strong affection which old men generally feel towards a\r\nplayful and endearing child. He had no children of his own, and little\r\nMargery was, therefore, a real solace to the ancient warrior. There was\r\nanother child, a few years older than Margery, who was admitted to play,\r\nand to learn out of the same book, with the daughter of the Pastons. This\r\nwas Richard Calle, the only son of an honest and painstaking man, who acted\r\nin the capacity of a steward for Sir John Fastolf, and conducted many of\r\nthe complicated affairs with which the old knight amused himself in the\r\nevening of a busy life--his friends complaining of \"the yearly great damage\r\nhe beareth in disbursing his money about shipping and boats, keeping a\r\nhouse up at Yarmouth to his great harm, and receiveth but chaffer and ware\r\nfor his corns and his wools, and then must abide a long day to make\r\nmoney.\"[11]\r\n\r\nRichard Calle has now grown into manhood. He is reputed to have received a\r\ngoodly inheritance from his father, which he has increased by provident\r\nenterprises in trade. When the Pastons wanted money, he was once always to\r\nbe applied to. But he has presumed to address his play-fellow Margery with\r\nthe language of affection; and though Sir John Paston had once said that,\r\nfor his part, Richard Calle might have his dowerless sister and welcome,\r\nfor he had always been a warm friend of the Pastons; his mother is\r\nindignant that a trader should think of marrying into a gentle family; and\r\nJohn of Gelston, the second son, in an hour when the fortunes of the house\r\nseemed in the ascendant, has vowed that Richard Calle \"should never have my\r\ngood-will for to make my sister to sell candles and mustard, at\r\nFramlingham.\"[12]\r\n\r\nMargery Paston sits in the Brown chamber, with her bright blue eyes dimmed\r\nwith tears. She is endeavouring to forget her own sorrows by reading a tale\r\nof imaginary griefs, which for four hundred years has never been read with\r\na tearless eye. She is at that passage of \"The Clerk's Tale\" of Chaucer,\r\nwhere Grisildis has her infant daughter taken from her, under pretence that\r\nit is to be put to death:----\r\n\r\n    \"But, at the last, to speaken she began,\r\n    And meekly she to the serjeant pray'd\r\n    (So as he was a worthy gentleman)\r\n    That she might kiss her child ere that it deid [died];\r\n    And in her barne [lap] this little child she laid\r\n    With full sad face, and 'gan the child to bliss,\r\n    And lulled it, and after 'gan it kiss.\"\r\n\r\nThe door of the chamber is hastily opened, and an old servant stands before\r\nMargery with a face of affright. All in that household love the gentle\r\nmaiden; and so the old man, seeing the tear in her eye, bids her be of good\r\ncheer, for though his worshipful mistress is now in a somewhat impatient\r\nhumor, and demands her instant attendance in the Oaken parlor, she is a\r\ngood lady at heart, and would soon forgive any slight cause of offence.\r\n\r\nDame Paston has called in two allies to constitute, with herself, the\r\ntribunal that is about to sit in judgment on Margery Paston. Dame Agnes\r\nPaston, the aged mother of the late heir of Caister, sits at the table with\r\nher daughter-in-law and the priest.\r\n\r\nMargery enters; and, in a moment, is kneeling at the feet of her mother,\r\nwith the accustomed reverence of child to parent. \"Oh, minion,\" says the\r\nmother, \"rise, I beseech you; it is not for such as you to kneel to a poor\r\nforlorn widow, left with few worldly goods. Mistress Calle has\r\nplenteousness all around her, and has nothing to ask of the world's gear.\r\nShe has her good house at Framlingham, and her full store at Norwich.\r\nMistress, know you the price of salted hams at this present? Are pickled\r\nherrings plenteous? We have some wool in loft, which we should not be\r\nunwilling to exchange for worsteds. How say you, Mistress Dry-goods; will\r\nyou deal, will you chaffer?\"\r\n\r\n\"My mother, what mean you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, minion, you know full well my meaning. You are an alien from your\r\nfamily. You are betrothed to a low trader, with no gentle blood in his\r\nveins.\"\r\n\r\n\"The good Sir William Paston, Knight, and whilom Judge of His Majesty's\r\nCourt of the Common Pleas, would rise from his grave to save a\r\ngranddaughter of his from inter-marrying with mustard and candle,\" quoth\r\nthe ancient lady. \"Faugh! a factor!\"\r\n\r\n\"And one whom I shrewdly suspect to be a heretic,\" says the priest, looking\r\nearnestly at Mistress Margaret Paston.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, my mother, why am I thus persecuted?\"\r\n\r\n\"Persecuted, foosooth!\" responds the elder dame; \"I took other rule with my\r\ndaughters; and well do I remember that when Elizabeth Clere, my niece,\r\ntried to intercede with me for her wilful cousin Mary, forasmuch as she had\r\nbeen 'beaten once in the week or twice, and sometimes twice in a day, and\r\nhad her head broken in several places,'[13] I told her that it was for\r\nwarning and ensample to all forward maidens who dared to think of love or\r\nmarriage without their parents' guidance. And with the help of my worthy\r\nlord, the good Sir William Paston, Knight, and Judge of His Majesty's Court\r\nof the Common Pleas--His Majesty Henry the Sixth gave him two robes and a\r\nhundred marks yearly; and may God him preserve upon his throne----\"\r\n\r\nThe priest and Mistress Margaret drown the good old lady's somewhat\r\ndisloyal gratitude (seeing that the House of York is in the ascendant) by\r\njudicious clearings of the voice, as they prepare to read the intercepted\r\nletter of Richard Calle, with sundry glosses.\r\n\r\n\"Minion,\" says the mother, \"know you this superscription?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a letter from my own Richard,\" cries the delighted girl; \"will you\r\ngive it me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Assuredly not. It convicts you of being a false liar,--or it lies itself.\r\nDid you not, with the fear of close custody, and bread and water, and maybe\r\nsome healing stripes, before your eyes, affirm that there was no contract\r\nbetween the dry-goodsman and yourself?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mother, I own my sin; I did affirm it, but I was wrong, and I am\r\npenitent.\"\r\n\r\n\"Vile brethel!\" exclaims the mother.\r\n\r\n\"She mentioned it not, even under the seal of confession,\" adds the priest.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, once in the week or twice, and sometimes twice a day, and she made an\r\nexcellent wife, by reason of the frequent beatings, and brought up her\r\nchildren accordant,\" soliloquises the old lady.\r\n\r\n\"Daughter, I conjure you to hear what this vile Richard Calle sayeth to\r\nyou. Tell me that it is false--tell me that he is a bold liar, when he\r\naffirmeth that you are contracted, and you shall at once have all freedom\r\nand reasonable pleasure; but if not----\"\r\n\r\n\"Mother, I listen.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hear, then, what this abominable bill imports. Sir James, please to read.\"\r\n\r\n\"'To Mistress Margery Paston:\r\n\r\n\"'Mine own lady and mistress, and before God very true wife, I, with heart\r\nfull, very sorrowfully recommend me unto you, as he that cannot be merry,\r\nnor nought shall be, till it be otherwise with us than it is yet; for this\r\nlife that we lead now is neither pleasure to God nor to the world,\r\nconsidering the great band of matrimony that is made betwixt us, and also\r\nthe great love that hath been, and as I trust yet is, betwixt us, and as on\r\nmy part never greater. Wherefore I beseech Almighty God comfort us as soon\r\nas it pleaseth Him; for us that ought of very right to be most together,\r\nare most asunder. Meseemeth it is a thousand years ago that I spake with\r\nyou----\"\r\n\r\nMargery here bursts into a passion of tears; and her mother, almost weeping\r\ntoo, ejaculates, \"My poor child!\" The priest looks at the lady somewhat\r\nspitefully, and proceeds:----\r\n\r\n\"'I had liever than all the good in the world I might be with you. Alas!\r\nalas! good lady full little remember they what they do that keep us thus\r\nasunder. Four times in the year are they accursed that let matrimony----'\"\r\n\r\n\"Accursed are they?\" exclaims the priest. \"Ban and anathema against us, my\r\nworshipful lady! But there are others, I wot, that the Church holds\r\naccursed; and this base mechanical be one of them, if I mistake not. Did I\r\nnot once hear him say--for the varlet ever had privilege to speak in this\r\nhouse, when his betters held their peace--did I not hear him once say that\r\nhis father had told him that he had seen the heretic priest, John Waddon,\r\nburnt at Framlingham, and that he (shame that such an unbeliever might\r\npresume to speak upon matters of the Church!) thought that the knowledge of\r\nthe truth was not advanced by such terrors, and that those who lit the\r\nfires for the Lollards had no sanction in the Gospel of Christ. For mine\r\nown part, I well believe that he has seduced our daughter from her\r\nobedience by his false and damnable opinions. Mistress Margery, did he\r\nnever open in your presence the book of that arch heretic, John Wiclif,\r\nwhich is called, 'The Book of the New Law'--the book which, in the\r\nConstitution of Archbishop Arundel, was forbidden to be read, under pain of\r\nthe greater excommunication?\"\r\n\r\nThe maiden answers not. The priest, looking earnestly at Mistress Margaret\r\nPaston, asks her if she did not think that there was a possibility of such\r\na devilish corruption having gone forward; and Mistress Margaret, her cheek\r\ncoloring a deep red, and then having an ashy paleness, speaks no more for\r\ngood or evil to her daughter, but quails before the priest. He has her\r\nsecret. There is a treasured volume in that house, which has been carefully\r\nlocked up for half a century, to be looked upon in the secret hour, when\r\nprying eyes are sleeping, and in the hour of tribulation, when careful eyes\r\nare waking. With Richard Calle, Mistress Margaret had often spoken of this\r\nbook; although even to possess it was to risk a charge of \"Lollardie,\" with\r\nall its penalties. The priest sees his triumph; and proceeds to make an end\r\nof as much of the letter as he chooses to read:----\r\n\r\n\"'I understand, lady, ye have had as much sorrow for me as any gentlewoman\r\nhath had in the world, as would God all that sorrow that ye have had had\r\nrested upon me, and that ye had been discharged of it; for I wis, lady, it\r\nis to me a death to hear that ye be entreated otherwise than ye ought to\r\nbe; this is a painful life that we lead. I cannot live thus without it be a\r\ngreat displeasure to God.'\"\r\n\r\n\"He thought not of God's displeasure when he presumed to speak of love to a\r\ndaughter of the Pastons,\" says the priest. \"A granddaughter of Sir William\r\nPaston, one of his Majesty's Justices,\" mutters the ancient lady. Sir James\r\ncontinues to read the missive:----\r\n\r\n\"'I suppose they deem we be not ensured together and if they do so I\r\nmarvel, for then they are not well advised, remembering the plainness that\r\nI brake to my mistress at the beginning, and I suppose by you, both; and ye\r\ndid as ye ought to do of very right; and if ye have done the contrary, as I\r\nhave been informed ye have done, ye did neither consciencely, nor to the\r\npleasure of God, without ye did it for fear, and for the time, to please\r\nsuch as were at that time about you; and if ye did it for this cause, it\r\nwas a reasonable cause, considering the great and importable calling upon\r\nye that ye had; and many an untrue tale was made to you of me, which, God\r\nknow it, I was never guilty of.\"[14]\r\n\r\n\"And now, pretty Mistress Margery,\" says Sir James, \"will you affirm that\r\nthis man sayeth untruly, when he sayeth that you are ensured together? You\r\nhave before said that you are not so ensured. Will you cast off your mother\r\nand your brothers to be the wife of a low factor, and a companion for idle\r\nqueans and the wives of fat burgesses, instead of wedding some noble\r\nknight, who will give you a castle to dwell in, with all worship and\r\nauthority? Deny the contract; there is guilt in affirming it even if it had\r\nbeen made in a moment of imprudence.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir James Gloys, and you, my honored mother,\" answers the maiden, \"Richard\r\nCalle says truly, that I did not consciencely, nor to the pleasure of God,\r\nwhen I concealed our contract for fear, and for the time. We are betrothed;\r\nand I rejoice at the handfasting. No pain, no fear, shall ever again lead\r\nme to deny it. He is my true husband, and may I ever be to him a reverent\r\nand loving wife. For who can I love as I have loved, and do love, Richard\r\nCalle,--the companion of my childhood, the instructor of my girlhood: a\r\ntrue man, as brave as if he were the sturdiest of belted knights--as wise\r\nas if he were the clerkliest of learned scholars. He has abundance; he is\r\ngenerous. When did a Paston ask Richard Calle for aid that his hand was not\r\nopen? We may not want his help just now; but if the time arrive, and\r\nassuredly it may be not far off, that hand would be again stretched out for\r\nsuccour. Come Richard Calle of gentle or simple, I heed not; he is my own\r\ntrue man, and to him is my faith plighted, for ever and aye.\"\r\n\r\n\"Twice in a day, and had her head broke in several places,\" grumbles the\r\nancient dame.\r\n\r\n\"Mistress Margery,\" responds the priest, \"you must take your own course.\r\nBut this is not now a matter for daughter and mother to settle between\r\nthem. It must before the Lord Bishop. In the name of Holy Church, I\r\nprohibit all intercourse by message or letter between Richard Calle and\r\nyourself. You must be in strict durance for a short season; and then a\r\nhigher than us shall decide, contract or no contract. Heaven forfend that\r\nI, or any servant of the altar, should let matrimony.\"\r\n\r\n\"My child, go to your chamber,\" whispers the subdued mother.\r\n\r\nWe see the shadow of Margery Paston, before she quits the Oaken parlor,\r\nkneeling for her mother's blessing.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Michaelmas of 1469 is nearly come. Margery Paston is still in durance\r\nat her mother's house. Every art has been tried to make her deny the\r\nbetrothal. The priest has worked upon the fears of the mother--the daughter\r\nhas been studiously kept from her presence. But this state of things cannot\r\nabide. Dame Margaret thus writes to Sir John Paston: \"I greet you well, and\r\nsend you God's blessing and mine; letting you weet that on Thursday last\r\nwas, my mother and I were with my Lord of Norwich, and desired him that he\r\nwould no more do in the matter touching your sister till that ye, and my\r\nbrother, and others, that were executors to your father, might be here\r\ntogether, for they had the rule of her as well as I; and he said plainly\r\nthat he had been required so often to examine her, that he might not, nor\r\nwould, no longer delay it: and charged me, in pain of cursing, that she\r\nshould not be deferred, but that she should appear before him the next day.\r\nAnd I said plainly that I would neither bring her nor send her. And then he\r\nsaid that he would send for her himself, and charged that she should be at\r\nher liberty to come when he sent for her.\"\r\n\r\nOn the next day--it is a Friday--Margery Paston is brought into the\r\nBishop's Court. There, surrounded with the panoply of the Church, sits old\r\nWalter Lyhart--he that built the roof of the nave, and the screen, of\r\nNorwich Cathedral. The maiden trembles, but her spirit remains unbroken.\r\nThe bishop puts her in remembrance how she was born,--what kin and friends\r\nshe has--\"And ye shall have more, young lady, if ye will be ruled and\r\nguided after them. But if ye will not, what rebuke, and loss, and shame\r\nwill be yours? They will evermore forsake you, for any good, or help, or\r\ncomfort that ye shall have of them. Be well advised. I have heard say that\r\nye love one that your friends are not well pleased that ye should love. Be\r\nadvised--be right well advised.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am the betrothed wife of Richard Calle. I must cleave to him for better\r\nfor worse.\"\r\n\r\n\"Rehearse to me what you said to him. Let me understand if it makes\r\nmatrimony?\"\r\n\r\n\"We have plighted our troth--we are handfasted. How can I repeat the words?\r\nRichard said----Oh, my lord! spare me, I am bound in my conscience,\r\nwhatsoever the words were. If the very words make not sure, make it, I\r\nbeseech you, surer ere I go hence.\"\r\n\r\nAnd then the bishop dismisses the maiden with many frowns.\r\n\r\nRichard Calle is summoned. He briefly tells the time and place where the\r\nvows were exchanged. The bishop is bewildered. He scarcely dare hesitate to\r\nconfirm the marriage. But the subtle priest is at his side, and he whispers\r\nthe fearful word of \"Lollardie.\" Then the bishop hastily breaks up the\r\ncourt, and says, \"That he supposed there should be found other things\r\nagainst him that might cause the letting the marriage; and therefore he\r\nwould not be too hasty to give sentence.\"\r\n\r\nMargery Paston stands again upon her mother's threshold. The aged servant\r\nis weeping as he opens the door: \"Oh, my dear young mistress! I am\r\ncommanded to shut this gate against you.\" The figure of Sir James Gloys\r\nlooms darkly in the hall. \"Begone, mistress!\" he exclaims. \"I will go to my\r\ngrandmother,\" sobs out the poor girl. \"Your grandmother banishes you for\r\never from her presence,\" retorts the churlish priest.\r\n\r\nIt is night. The pride and the purity of the unhappy Margery forbid her to\r\nseek the protection of her Richard. She has been watched. Exhausted and\r\nheart-broken, she gladly accepts the shelter which Roger Best offers her.\r\nThat shelter becomes her prison.\r\n\r\nHere closes the record. But what a succession of Shadows is called up by\r\nthe endorsement of the letter which tells of these sorrows: \"_They were\r\nafter married together._\" The contract could not be dissolved.\r\n\r\nAt one time we see the shadows of Richard and Margery Calle sitting\r\ncheerily together in their peaceful home at Framlingham. The intrigues that\r\nare carrying on in the Duke of Norfolk's castle, under whose walls they\r\nabide, touch them not. They are not called upon to declare either for York\r\nor Lancaster.\r\n\r\nAt another time we fancy John of Gelston, Margery's younger brother, a\r\nwandering fugitive after the battle of Barnet, throwing himself upon the\r\ndespised Factor for refuge and succor. The fortunes of the Pastons are now\r\nat the lowest ebb. Norfolk holds Caister. Edward the Fourth has pardoned\r\ntheir revolt--but he will not trust them, or employ them. At length Norfolk\r\ndies. Caister is restored to the Pastons--but they are penniless.\r\n\r\nWe see the shadow of a great feast within those half-ruinous walls. The\r\nFactor has procured the means from his friends the Lombards. He now sits\r\nupon the dais. Sir John Paston calls him brother. Dame Paston greets him as\r\nson. John of Gelston says, \"I would that my sister should not sell mustard\r\nand candles at Framlingham--and assuredly she shall not. Richard Calle has\r\nmanaged his substance better than we; he can win broad lands enow. Kiss me,\r\nsister.\"\r\n\r\nThere is one shadow of Margery which rests upon our mind. She sits with her\r\nmother in the Oaken parlor at Norwich, reading from a volume, now opened\r\nwithout fear, \"Blessed are the peace-makers.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[11] \"Paston Letters;\" edited by A. Ramsay.\r\n\r\n[12] \"Paston Letters.\"\r\n\r\n[13] \"Paston Letters.\"\r\n\r\n[14] This and the preceding passages are given literally from Calle's\r\nletter in the Paston Collection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the London Times.\r\n\r\nCLEOPATRA'S NEEDLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut a few years ago, the imperishable records of the Assyrian empire were\r\ndiscovered amidst the sands of the Euphrates by the intelligence and\r\nenterprise of a single English traveller. What is the value of the ruins of\r\nPompeii by the side of these awful records of the genius and power of a\r\nmighty nation, which had passed from the earth apparently as a wave passes\r\naway on the surface of the sea? The official persons charged with the\r\ndirection of such matters would, of course, satisfy themselves in the first\r\ninstance that there was no trickery, no spice of adventure or imposition,\r\nabout the project of removing the Assyrian marbles to England. When this\r\nwas done, was it not natural to suppose that they would have clutched at\r\nthe opportunity of adding yet another trophy to the relics of the\r\nParthenon? The history of Mr. Layard is there to show how weak is the\r\ncharacter of that enthusiasm which must work out its effects at a\r\ndistance--in what driblets any assistance from the public purse is\r\nvouchsafed to an enterprise which is not recommended to notice by the\r\nuntiring zeal of a projector! Consider the money fooled away on the basin\r\nat Keyham on the one hand, and the inefficient aid afforded to Mr. Layard\r\nfor the removal of the Assyrian marbles on the other, and our meaning will\r\nbe at once evident. We desire to-day to call attention to another public\r\nshortcoming of the like nature.\r\n\r\nEnglishmen who travel from their native country to the British Indian\r\nempire, as they pass through Alexandria, take occasion to visit two tall\r\nobelisks of red Thebaic granite on the south side of the Great Harbour.\r\nThese relics of the remotest periods of Egyptian history are covered with\r\ninscriptions which possess great interest for the antiquarian,\r\nindependently of the value which attaches to the shafts or pillars\r\nthemselves. In our columns yesterday will be found a long and particular\r\naccount of the traditions which must ennoble these mute interpreters of the\r\npast in the eyes of the latest posterity; we do not, therefore, deem it\r\nnecessary to repeat the tale in this place. One of the two obelisks remains\r\nerect in its original site; the other lies prostrate on the sand, with\r\nwhich it is partly covered. A portion of its pedestal has been built into\r\nthe wall which at that spot constitutes the fortification of the town. The\r\none which yet remains upright on the spot where once stood the temple of\r\nthe Caesars is the property of the Egyptian Government; the other, which\r\nlies neglected on the earth, belongs to the English nation. It is ours by\r\nconquest--it is ours by gift. It is a trophy won by our arms when the\r\ngallant Abercromby fell at the head of his victorious troops. As though\r\nthis title were not sufficient, in 1820 Mehemet Ali, then Pasha of Egypt\r\nset at rest any doubt which might have existed as to our title to this\r\ntrophy by its long abandonment on the field of battle. He solemnly\r\npresented it to George IV. Nor has a shadow of doubt ever been cast upon\r\nour right to this memorial of past times and of our own military glory,\r\nsave by a modest inuendo of the French consul in 1830, when the French were\r\nbusy removing the obelisk of Luxor. That worthy and intelligent functionary\r\nsuggested that, \"as the English had so long neglected the Pasha's present,\r\nthey might be considered to have relinquished it, and therefore it might as\r\nwell be taken away in the French vessel which had come for the other\r\nobelisk.\" To this modest proposition the English government demurred, and\r\naccordingly Cleopatra's Needle has been left upon the sand in the harbour\r\nof Alexandria, until it may suit the English to take some efficient steps\r\nfor its removal. All authoritative reports from the spot inform us that the\r\ninscription is partly defaced upon one side, but in no other respect. The\r\nsand from the desert has in great measure preserved the monument which has\r\nbeen so long abandoned to its fate. Truth, however, compels us to call\r\nattention to the language of our report, which adds, that if the obelisk\r\n\"be not removed at once, it will doubtless, ere long, become utterly ruined\r\nand worthless.\" This result will not be attributable to the ravages of\r\ntime, but to the injuries inflicted by idle or mischievous persons on this\r\nvaluable record and monument of by-gone days.\r\n\r\nA correspondent furnishes the _Times_ with the following interesting\r\nhistorical notices of this celebrated monument:\r\n\r\n     \"Travellers who visit Alexandria cannot fail to observe, on\r\n     the south side of the great harbor, now called the New Port,\r\n     a beautiful obelisk of red Thebaic granite, or Syenite,\r\n     covered with hieroglyphics, standing erect where was once\r\n     the Caesarium, or Temple of Caesar, while near it another\r\n     similar monument lies prostrate, and partly covered by the\r\n     sand. To these relics of a remote antiquity the Arabs give\r\n     the name of Mesellet Faraun, or _Pharaoh's Packing Needle_,\r\n     a term which is, indeed, applied by them to all obelisks.\r\n     The traditions of the later periods of the Roman Empire, and\r\n     of a subsequent time, seem to have attributed many objects\r\n     at Alexandria to Cleopatra, and the obelisks in question are\r\n     accordingly best known to Europeans as _Cleopatra's\r\n     Needles_, a trivial designation, possessing as little\r\n     historical value as that of \"Queen Elizabeth's Pocket\r\n     Pistol,\" which is given to the great gun at Dover. The\r\n     classical term _obelisk_ is, in its origin, not less\r\n     trivial, if it be true that it is derived from the Latin\r\n     _obeliscus_, a diminutive of the Greek word [Greek: obelos],\r\n     which means, literally, a spit, as indicative of the\r\n     peculiar form of this species of monument.\r\n\r\n     \"As far as the true history of these obelisks is concerned,\r\n     which is principally to be deduced from the monarchs' names\r\n     sculptured on them, they appear to have been originally cut\r\n     at the granite quarries of Syene, at the first cataract in\r\n     Upper Egypt, 750 miles from their present site, by\r\n     Thothmosis III. This monarch was one of the most celebrated\r\n     rulers of that remarkable country. We find remains of him in\r\n     Nubia, at Samneh, at Premmis, and at Amada, proving that his\r\n     sway extended even beyond the third cataract. He added also\r\n     largely to the great temple of Karnak; and on the sculptures\r\n     in one of its rooms he is represented as presenting\r\n     offerings to his ancestors or predecessors of eight several\r\n     dynasties, namely: the kings of Thebes, of Abydos, of\r\n     Memphis, of Ethiopia, and of four other divisions of Egypt.\r\n     In one of the tombs near Thebes is a painting of a grand\r\n     procession of men of the several nations bordering on the\r\n     Nile, who are bringing their costly gifts in token of homage\r\n     to this king. Under Thothmosis III., who held Upper and\r\n     Lower Egypt and Ethiopia, the kingdom of Thebes had reached\r\n     its full size. Several later kings may have been more\r\n     wealthy, and more powerful, and their conquests may have\r\n     extended further, but those conquests were only temporary;\r\n     and the glories of those later kings never threw the reign\r\n     of Thothmosis III. into the shade.\r\n\r\n     \"The central inscriptions on the four faces of these\r\n     obelisks were sculptured by the monarch whom we have just\r\n     described. The lateral inscriptions were added by a king who\r\n     was, if possible, even more celebrated, namely, Amunmai\r\n     Rameses II., commonly known by the name of Sesostris, the\r\n     monarch under whom Upper Egypt rose to its greatest height\r\n     in arms, in art, and in wealth. It is unnecessary to do more\r\n     than allude to the fabled history of this monarch; but\r\n     confining ourselves to the particulars recorded on\r\n     imperishable monuments of stone, we find that he finished\r\n     the palace of the Memnonium or Mamunei at Abydos, and also\r\n     the temple of Osiris, in the same city; and on one of the\r\n     walls of the latter he carved that list of his forefathers\r\n     now in the British Museum, which is known by the name of the\r\n     Tablet of Abydos. At Thebes, besides adding to the buildings\r\n     of his predecessors, he erected a new palace, which, like\r\n     that at Abydos, was by the Greeks called the Memnonium. In\r\n     the first courtyard was a colossal statue of himself, larger\r\n     than any other in Egypt, and in the second yard were two\r\n     smaller ones, from one of which was taken the colossal head\r\n     now in the British Museum.\r\n\r\n     \"The two obelisks of Alexandria likewise have the names and\r\n     titles of some Pharaoh of later times, by whom they may\r\n     probably have been removed to Memphis; but subsequently the\r\n     Ptolemies, to embellish their Greco-Egyptian capital,\r\n     transferred them to Alexandria. In the reign of the Emperor\r\n     Tiberius, when the Alexandrians completed the beautiful\r\n     temple to his honor named the Sebaste, or Caesar's Temple,\r\n     which stood by the side of the harbor, and was surrounded by\r\n     a sacred grove, ornamented with porticoes, and fitted up\r\n     with libraries, paintings, and statues,--it being the most\r\n     lofty building in the city,--they set up in front of this\r\n     temple the two obelisks of Thothmosis and Rameses, which,\r\n     like the other monuments of the Theban kings, have outlived\r\n     all the temples and palaces of their Greek and Roman\r\n     successors.\r\n\r\n     \"These beautiful memorials of two of the most powerful and\r\n     celebrated rulers of Egypt appear not to have suffered any\r\n     material injury from the vicissitudes to which the dominions\r\n     of those kings have during so many ages been subjected.[15]\r\n     From a very early period one of them has been thrown down\r\n     from the pedestal on which it stood; but this seeming\r\n     calamity has probably preserved its sculptures better than\r\n     if it had remained on its pedestal, for its still erect\r\n     companion, though well preserved on the sides exposed to the\r\n     sea, has suffered a good deal from the beating against it of\r\n     the land-wind, which blows with violence and is charged with\r\n     sand. With the exception of the four corners of the base,\r\n     where, like the obelisk in the Hippodrome at Constantinople,\r\n     it would seem to have formerly been held to its pedestal by\r\n     four cubes of bronze, the fallen obelisk is perfect, and its\r\n     sculptures are in comparatively good preservation. Its\r\n     length is 64 feet, and at its base it is about 8 feet\r\n     square; its weight being estimated at about 240 tons.[16]\r\n     The obelisk is of great value from its antiquity, its\r\n     proportions, and, moreover, as an imperishable memorial of\r\n     British valor.\r\n\r\n     \"After the English were in possession of Alexandria (as we\r\n     find it recorded by Dr. Clarke in his _Travels_) a\r\n     subscription was opened among the officers of the army and\r\n     navy for the purpose of removing the prostrate obelisk to\r\n     Great Britain. With the money thus raised they purchased one\r\n     of the vessels that Menou had sunk in the old port of\r\n     Alexandria. This they raised, and prepared for its\r\n     reception. The work went on rapidly, the obelisk was turned,\r\n     and its lower surface was found to be in a high state of\r\n     preservation. It was then moved, by means of machinery\r\n     constructed for the purpose, towards the vessel prepared to\r\n     receive it. Lord Cavan presided at this undertaking. A naval\r\n     officer, who was present upon the occasion, brought over to\r\n     England the plans projected for conveying this splendid\r\n     trophy of the success of our arms to the metropolis of this\r\n     country; and there is every reason to believe the design\r\n     would have been accomplished. Its interruption took place in\r\n     consequence of an order preventing the sailors from\r\n     assisting at the work. An eye-witness, who is still living,\r\n     states that about 5,000L. were subscribed by the army, that\r\n     300 Sepoys worked for three or four months in constructing a\r\n     jetty, whence the obelisk was to have been embarked; but\r\n     that the General who then commanded at Malta wrote to the\r\n     military authorities in Egypt, objecting to the employment\r\n     of the troops in such a work, and ordering them to suspend\r\n     their operations. This was accordingly done, and the money\r\n     unexpended was returned to the subscribers.\r\n\r\n     \"Though the obelisk was thus left behind when the British\r\n     forces quitted Egypt, the idea of bringing it to England was\r\n     never abandoned; and whatever doubts might have existed as\r\n     to our right to the possession of a trophy which had been\r\n     taken, but afterwards (as it were) abandoned on the field of\r\n     battle, were set at rest by the gift of it made in the year\r\n     1820 by the late Mehemet Ali Pasha to King George IV.\r\n\r\n     \"Notwithstanding this gift, the obelisk still remained\r\n     without any definitive steps being taken for its removal to\r\n     England.[17] In 1830, when the French sent a vessel to\r\n     Alexandria to transport to France the obelisk of Luxor,\r\n     which is now standing in the Place de la Concorde at Paris,\r\n     and also, as it was talked of at the time, the one of\r\n     'Cleopatra's needles' which is yet standing, the French\r\n     Consul in Egypt is said to have made the modest suggestion\r\n     that, 'as the English had so long neglected the Pasha's\r\n     present, they might be considered to have relinquished it,\r\n     and therefore it might as well be taken away in the French\r\n     vessel which had come for the other obelisk.'\r\n\r\n     \"This, however, was not allowed to take place. Neither have\r\n     the English taken any steps to acquire possession of a\r\n     monument which is the indisputable property of the British\r\n     nation, and which, if not removed, will doubtless ere long\r\n     become utterly ruined and worthless. The stones of the\r\n     pedestal on which it stood have been carried away for\r\n     building purposes; the obelisk itself has been exposed to\r\n     many marks inflicted by the curious and idlers of\r\n     Alexandria, and as a last indignity one end of it has\r\n     actually been built into the wall surrounding the port,\r\n     forming part of the new fortifications of the city.\r\n\r\n     \"The subject of the removal of this obelisk has often been\r\n     before Parliament. On the 2d of June last, in the House of\r\n     Peers, the Marquis of Westmeath, at the request of several\r\n     military and naval officers, inquired what steps had been\r\n     taken for obtaining possession of or for removing it. He\r\n     stated that the opinion of the late Sir R. Peel, expressed\r\n     to himself, was, that it was a monument which ought to be\r\n     brought to London and erected as a memorial of Sir Ralph\r\n     Abercromby and others who had fought and died in Egypt. The\r\n     late Sir George Murray had also stated that he joined with\r\n     all his military and naval friends, who desired that the\r\n     obelisk should be brought to this country. In reply to Lord\r\n     Westmeath's inquiry the Earl of Carlisle admitted the\r\n     importance which attached to the obelisk, not merely as a\r\n     memorial of the ancient art of Egypt, but also as a monument\r\n     of British heroism; but said that he apprehended there were\r\n     some mechanical difficulties. This, however, can hardly be\r\n     the case, inasmuch as the obelisk would unquestionably have\r\n     been removed in 1801, had it not been for the reasons\r\n     already stated.\r\n\r\n     \"As a relic of ancient art, as a memorial of two of the most\r\n     renowned monarchs of Egypt, and as a trophy of British\r\n     valor, this obelisk is without price. If allowed to remain\r\n     in its present state, it will inevitably be destroyed, and\r\n     there cannot exist the slightest doubt that it was the\r\n     bounden duty of the British nation to see to its\r\n     preservation, which can only be secured by carrying out the\r\n     intention of our valiant troops half-a-century ago--namely,\r\n     by transplanting it to England. The appropriate site for it\r\n     might either be the courtyard of the British Museum, where\r\n     it would form a noble addition to the peerless collection of\r\n     Egyptian monuments, of which the famed 'Rosetta Stone,' that\r\n     other trophy of our occupation of Egypt, forms a part; or it\r\n     might, perhaps, be more appropriately set up in St. James's\r\n     Park, at the back of the Horse Guards. The expense of its\r\n     removal could not be great; but, whatever might be its\r\n     amount, it is certain, when even Mr. Hume has expressed an\r\n     interest in the subject, that the nation would cheerfully\r\n     incur it. An offer has indeed been made to Government to\r\n     bring it to England by contract for a comparatively trifling\r\n     sum.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[15] Mr. Gould, in the \"Builder\" of August 2, says, from certain\r\nauthorities, it would appear that both were standing at the close of the\r\n12th century.\r\n\r\n[16] On the 15th of April, 1832, when a proposition for its removal was\r\nmade in the House of commons, it was stated that it weighed 284 tons.\r\nCaptain Smyth, R.N., supposes it to be 230 tons.\r\n\r\n[17] In 1822 Captain Smyth, R.N., was prepared, with the consent of Mehemet\r\nAli, to attempt its removal, but could not procure the authority of our\r\nGovernment. The Pasha offered to build a pier for the embarkation of the\r\nobelisk, and to render Captain Smyth every assistance for its removal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the London Times\r\n\r\nHISTORY AND CONDITION OF THE CHEAP POSTAGE SYSTEM.\r\n\r\n\r\nA traveller sauntering through the Lake districts of England, some years\r\nago, arrived at a small public-house just as the postman stopped to deliver\r\na letter. A young girl came out to receive it. She took it in her hand,\r\nturned it over and over, and asked the charge. It was a large sum--no less\r\nthan a shilling. Sighing heavily she observed that it came from her\r\nbrother, but that she was too poor to take it in, and she returned it to\r\nthe postman accordingly. The traveller was a man of kindness as well as of\r\nobservation; he offered to pay the postage himself, and in spite of more\r\nreluctance on the girl's part than he could well understand he did pay it,\r\nand gave her the letter. No sooner, however, was the postman's back turned\r\nthan she confessed that the proceeding had been concerted between her\r\nbrother and herself, that the letter was empty, that certain signs on the\r\ndirection conveyed all that she wanted to know, and that as neither of them\r\ncould afford to pay postage they had devised this method of franking the\r\nintelligence desired. The traveller pursued his journey, and as he plodded\r\nover the Cumberland fells he mused upon the badness of a system which drove\r\npeople to such straits for means of correspondence, and defeated its own\r\nobjects all the time. With most men such musings would have ended before\r\nthe hour, but this man's name was Rowland Hill, and it was from this\r\nincident and these reflections that the whole scheme of penny postage was\r\nderived.\r\n\r\nThe value of this reform is felt in every household throughout the kingdom,\r\nbut its extent will be well shown by the extraction of some figures from a\r\nreturn which has just been made to the House of Commons. The first general\r\nreduction of postage took place on the 5th of December, 1839--a fourpenny\r\nrate being interposed for a short time before the universal charge of a\r\npenny. At this time the number of letters delivered annually in the united\r\nkingdom was about 75 millions, the actual estimate for 1839 being\r\n75,907,572. The gross amount of the tax levied upon this delivery was no\r\nless than 2,339,737_l._, of which, as the cost of management was only\r\n687,000_l._, there was 1,652,424_l._ carried to the account of profit. Last\r\nyear the number of letters delivered in the united kingdom was estimated at\r\nupwards of _three hundred and forty-seven millions_, while the penny tax\r\nupon the same amounted to no more than 2,264,684_l._, so that while our\r\npayments to the Exchequer have been actually lessened, the service rendered\r\nto the public has been multiplied fivefold--in other words, we pay less for\r\nfive letters than we formerly paid for one.\r\n\r\nIt is worth remark that the correspondence in the three kingdoms has\r\nincreased almost equally. In 1839 the deliveries were 59,982,520;\r\n8,301,904; and 7,623,148, in England, Ireland, and Scotland, respectively;\r\nwhile last year they were 276,252,642; 35,388,895; and 35,427,534. The rate\r\nof increase has been continuous, though not quite constant, ever since the\r\nreduction. The first effect of the reform was to double the deliveries at\r\nonce, and turn the 75 millions into upwards of 160 millions. From that time\r\nto this the increase has proceeded at the rate of 10 or 20 millions a year,\r\nthe smallest augmentation being in the famous year of 1848, when the\r\ndelivery exceeded only by 6 millions that of 1847; and the largest in the\r\nequally famous times of 1845, when railway speculations added 28 millions\r\nof epistles to correspondence of the year preceding. The return before us\r\nincludes, we hardly know with what view, a weekly account taken once a\r\nmonth for 1850, and from this curious table it would seem that during the\r\nmonth in which ladies talk least they write most; at any rate the largest\r\nnumber of letters yet counted was for the week ending February the 21st.\r\n\r\nThe cost of management has, of course, been swelled considerably under the\r\nnew system, though by no means in proportion to the increased service, for\r\nwhereas the deliveries, as we have said, are multiplied fivefold, the\r\nexpenses are only multiplied about twice and a half, being 1,460,785_l._ in\r\n1850, against 686,768_l._ in 1839. The return does not comprise the items\r\nout of which this sum is made up, though it specifies the amounts paid in\r\neach year for the conveyance of mails by railway. These amounts fluctuate\r\nrather curiously from 12,623_l._ in 1839, to 206,357_l._ in this present\r\nyear of 1851--not increasing gradually or even constantly, but rising or\r\nfalling occasionally, though with an ultimate tendency to rise. We should\r\nhave rather liked to see the expenses of management and conveyance stated\r\nseparately, and some means of comparison given between the cost of railway\r\ncarriage and that of the old mail coaches. About 10,000_l._ per annum of\r\nthe total disbursements is devoted, we are told, to pensions, and must\r\ntherefore be distinguished from the direct expenses of the Post-office\r\nservice. All things considered, perhaps, this \"non-effective\" charge is not\r\nheavy; in fact, we believe that Post-office servants are by no means\r\nextravagantly paid either for their work or at their retirement.\r\n\r\nThe Money Order office forms a distinct establishment of itself, and a\r\ncurious institution it is. The amount of orders issued in 1840, the first\r\nyear of the system, was 240,063_l_. for England and Wales, 47,295_l._ for\r\nIreland, and 25,765_l._ for Scotland. In the year 1850 these amounts had\r\nincreased in England to no less a sum than 7,173,622_l._, in Ireland to\r\n623,732_l._, and in Scotland to 697,143_l._ The total sum was\r\n8,494,498_l._, and the number of orders of which it was composed 4,439,713,\r\nshowing an average of some shillings less than 2_l._ per order. The\r\nproportion between the number and the amount of the orders does not vary\r\ngreatly in the three kingdoms, though the average amount of each order is\r\nsomewhat larger in Scotland than Ireland, and in England than Scotland.\r\n\r\nThe Scotch transactions fell off considerably in the year 1849, but the\r\nEnglish and Irish offices have steadily increased their business, nor is\r\nany effect perceptible in the latter country, either from the famine or the\r\nrebellion. The return of \"money orders issued\" is distinguished from that\r\nof \"money orders paid,\" and the difference between these gross amounts is\r\nno less than 11,000_l._ in favor of the Post-office for the year ending the\r\n31st of last December. Some of these orders will no doubt have come in for\r\npayment during the current year, but we suspect that ignorance, negligence,\r\nor accident must be leaving an appreciable balance to accumulate on the\r\nside of the office. Country bankers, we believe, used to reckon upon a gain\r\nof 5l. per cent. on the score of notes lost, mislaid, hoarded, destroyed,\r\nor otherwise not presented for payment. Money orders are doubtless more\r\nrigorously exchanged for cash, but there must still, we imagine, be a\r\nprofit from this source, especially as the Post-office circumscribes the\r\nterm of its liability, which bankers did not. The total expenses of the\r\nMoney Order offices, both in London and the country, are returned at\r\n70,577_l._ and the total amount of commission received at 73,813_l._--a\r\nfair balance of charge and service.\r\n\r\nThe actual benefits, however, of this prodigious reform extend far beyond\r\nthose immediately represented in the figures we have given. It is not the\r\nmere saving of 4d. or 5d. on a letter by which the country has so\r\nenormously gained. The facilitation of business, the diffusion of\r\ninformation, the correspondence of friends, and the maintenance of family\r\nconnexions, which in old days were severed for ever, are the real and\r\ninestimable advantages of Mr. ROWLAND HILL'S invention. Like most\r\nreformers, he had to contend with violent and not always sincere\r\nopposition. The system, indeed, was long deprived of a fair trial by the\r\nobstinate resistance of those who should have aided him, and it is mainly\r\nowing to this concerted hostility that the results are not as favorable to\r\nthe revenue as they are to the welfare of the country. But the principle is\r\nnow established, and of all the reductions which a Chancellor of the\r\nExchequer has ever made there has been none attended with such universal\r\nrelief, convenience, and benefit as this sacrifice of 800,000_l._ for the\r\nsake of the letter writers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOCTOBER.\r\n\r\nBY MISS ALICE CAREY.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Not the light of the long blue summer,\r\n      Nor the flowery huntress, Spring,\r\n    Nor the chilly and moaning Winter,\r\n      Doth peace to my bosom bring,\r\n\r\n    Like the hazy and red October,\r\n      When the woods stand bare and brown,\r\n    And into the lap of the south land,\r\n      The flowers are blowing down;\r\n\r\n    When all night long, in the moonlight,\r\n      The boughs of the roof tree chafe,\r\n    And the wind, like a wandering poet,\r\n      Is singing a mournful waif;\r\n\r\n    And all day through the cloud-armies,\r\n      The sunbeams coquettishly rove--\r\n    For then in my path first unfolded\r\n      The sweet passion-flower of love.\r\n\r\n    With bosom as pale as the sea-shell,\r\n      And soft as the flax unspun,\r\n    And locks like the nut-brown shadows\r\n      In the light of the sunken sun,\r\n\r\n    Came the maiden whose wonderful beauty\r\n      Enchanted my soul from pain,\r\n    And gladdened my heart, that can never,\r\n      No, never be happy again.\r\n\r\n    Far away from life's pain and passion,\r\n      And our Eden of love, she went,\r\n    Like a pale star fading softly\r\n      From the morning's golden tent.\r\n\r\n    But oft, when the bosom of Autumn\r\n      Is warm with the summer beams,\r\n    We meet in the pallid shadows\r\n      That border the land of dreams,\r\n\r\n    For seeing my woe through the splendor\r\n      That hovers about her above,\r\n    She puts from her forehead the glory,\r\n      And listens again to my love.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMY NOVEL:\r\n\r\nOR, VARIETIES IN ENGLISH LIFE.[18]\r\n\r\nBY PISISTRATUS CAXTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK VII.--INITIAL CHAPTER.\r\n\r\n\"What is courage?\" said my uncle Roland, rousing himself from a reverie\r\ninto which he had fallen after the Sixth Book in this history had been read\r\nto our family circle.\r\n\r\n\"What is courage?\" he repeated more earnestly. \"Is it insensibility to\r\nfear? _That_ may be the mere accident of constitution; and, if so, there is\r\nno more merit in being courageous than in being this table.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am very glad to hear you speak thus,\" observed Mr. Caxton, \"for I should\r\nnot like to consider myself a coward; yet I am very sensible to fear in all\r\ndangers, bodily and moral.\"\r\n\r\n\"La, Austin, how can you say so?\" cried my mother, firing up; \"was it not\r\nonly last week that you faced the great bull that was rushing after Blanche\r\nand the children?\"\r\n\r\nBlanche at that recollection stole to my father's chair, and hanging over\r\nhis shoulder, kissed his forehead.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Caxton_, (sublimely unmoved by these flatteries.)--\"I don't deny that\r\nI faced the bull, but I assert that I was horribly frightened.\"\r\n\r\n_Roland._--\"The sense of honor which conquers fear is the true courage of\r\nchivalry: you could not run away when others were looking on--no gentleman\r\ncould.\"\r\n\r\n_Mr. Caxton._--\"Fiddledee! It was not on my gentility that I stood,\r\nCaptain, I should have run fast enough, if it had done any good. I stood\r\nupon my understanding. As the bull could run faster than I could, the only\r\nchance of escape was to make the brute as frightened as myself.\"\r\n\r\n_Blanche._--\"Ah, you did not think of that, your only thought was to save\r\nme and the children.\"\r\n\r\n_Mr. Caxton._--\"Possibly, my dear--very possibly I might have been afraid\r\nfor you too--but I was very much afraid for myself. However, luckily, I had\r\nthe umbrella, and I sprang it up and spread it forth in the animal's stupid\r\neyes, hurling at him simultaneously the biggest lines I could think of in\r\nthe First Chorus of the 'Seven against Thebes.' I began with ELEDEMNAS\r\nPEDIOPLOKTUPOS; and when I came to the grand howl of [Greek: Io, io, io,\r\nio],--the beast stood appalled as at the roar of a lion. I shall never\r\nforget his amazed snort at the Greek. Then he kicked up his hind legs, and\r\nwent bolt through the gap in the hedge. Thus, armed with AEschylus and the\r\numbrella, I remained master of the field; but (continued Mr. Caxton,\r\ningenuously) I should not like to go through that half minute again.\"\r\n\r\n\"No man would,\" said the Captain kindly. \"I should be very sorry to face a\r\nbull myself, even with a bigger umbrella than yours, and even though I had\r\nAEschylus, and Homer to boot, at my fingers' ends.\"\r\n\r\n_Mr. Caxton._--\"You would not have minded if it had been a Frenchman with a\r\nsword in his hand?\"\r\n\r\n_Captain._--\"Of course not. Rather liked it than otherwise,\" he added\r\ngrimly.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Caxton._--\"Yet many a Spanish matador, who doesn't care a button for a\r\nbull, would take to his heels at the first lunge en carte from a Frenchman.\r\nTherefore, in fact, if courage be a matter of constitution, it is also a\r\nmatter of custom. We face calmly the dangers we are habituated to, and\r\nrecoil from those of which we have no familiar experience. I doubt if\r\nMarshal Turenne himself would have been quite at his ease on the\r\ntight-rope; and a rope-dancer, who seems disposed to scale the heavens with\r\nTitanic temerity, might possibly object to charge on a cannon.\"\r\n\r\n_Captain Roland._--\"Still, either this is not the courage I mean, or there\r\nis another kind of it. I mean by courage that which is the especial force\r\nand dignity of the human character, without which there is no reliance on\r\nprinciple, no constancy in virtue--a something,\" continued my uncle,\r\ngallantly, and with a half bow towards my mother, \"which your sex shares\r\nwith our own. When the lover, for instance, clasps the hand of his\r\nbetrothed, and says, 'Wilt thou be true to me, in spite of absence and\r\ntime, in spite of hazard and fortune, though my foes malign me, though thy\r\nfriends may dissuade thee, and our lot in life may be rough and rude?' and\r\nwhen the betrothed answers, 'I will be true,' does not the lover trust to\r\nher courage as well as her love?\"\r\n\r\n\"Admirably put, Roland,\" said my father. \"But _apropos_ of what do you\r\npuzzle us with these queries on courage?\"\r\n\r\n_Captain Roland_, (with a slight blush.)--\"I was led to the inquiry\r\n(though, perhaps, it may be frivolous to take so much thought of what, no\r\ndoubt, costs Pisistratus so little) by the last chapters in my nephew's\r\nstory. I see this poor boy, Leonard, alone with his fallen hopes, (though\r\nvery irrational they were,) and his sense of shame. And I read his heart, I\r\ndare say, better than Pisistratus does, for I could feel like that boy if I\r\nhad been in the same position; and, conjecturing what he and thousands like\r\nhim must go through, I asked myself, 'What can save him and them?' I\r\nanswered, as a soldier would answer, 'Courage!' Very well. But pray,\r\nAustin, what is courage?\"\r\n\r\n_Mr. Caxton._ (prudently backing out of a reply.)--\"_Papoe!_ Brother,\r\nsince you have just complimented the ladies on that quality, you had better\r\naddress your question to them.\"\r\n\r\nBlanche here leant both hands on my father's chair, and said, looking down\r\nat first bashfully, but afterwards warming with the subject, \"Do you not\r\nthink, sir, that little Helen has already suggested, if not what is\r\ncourage, what at least is the real essence of all courage that endures and\r\nconquers, that ennobles, and hallows, and redeems? Is it not Patience,\r\nfather?--and that is why we women have a courage of our own. Patience does\r\nnot affect to be superior to fear, but at least it never admits despair.\"\r\n\r\n_Pisistratus._--\"Kiss me, my Blanche, for you have come near to the truth\r\nwhich perplexed the soldier and puzzled the sage.\"\r\n\r\n_Mr. Caxton_, (tartly.)--\"If you mean me by the sage, I was not puzzled at\r\nall. Heaven knows you do right to inculcate patience--it is a virtue very\r\nmuch required in your readers. Nevertheless,\" added my father, softening\r\nwith the enjoyment of his joke--\"nevertheless, Blanche and Helen are quite\r\nright. Patience is the courage of the conqueror; it is the virtue, _par\r\nexcellence_, of Man against Destiny--of the One against the World, and of\r\nthe Soul against Matter. Therefore this is the courage of the Gospel; and\r\nits importance, in a social view--its importance to races and\r\ninstitutions--cannot be too earnestly inculcated. What is it that\r\ndistinguishes the Anglo-Saxon from all other branches of the human family,\r\npeoples deserts with his children, and consigns to them the heritage of\r\nrising worlds? What but his faculty to brave, to suffer, to endure--the\r\npatience that resists firmly, and innovates slowly? Compare him with the\r\nFrenchman. The Frenchman has plenty of valor--that there is no denying; but\r\nas for fortitude, he has not enough to cover the point of a pin. He is\r\nready to rush out of the world if he is bit by a flea.\"\r\n\r\n_Captain Roland._--\"There was a case in the papers the other day, Austin,\r\nof a Frenchman who actually did destroy himself because he was so teased by\r\nthe little creatures you speak of. He left a paper on his table, saying\r\nthat 'life was not worth having at the price of such torments.'\"[19]\r\n\r\n_Mr. Caxton_, (solemnly.)--\"Sir, their whole political history, since the\r\ngreat meeting of the Tiers Etat, has been the history of men who would\r\nrather go to the devil than be bit by a flea. It is the record of human\r\nimpatience, that seeks to force time, and expects to grow forests from the\r\nspawn of a mushroom. Wherefore, running through all extremes of\r\nconstitutional experiment, when they are nearest to democracy they are next\r\ndoor to a despot; and all they have really done is to destroy whatever\r\nconstitutes the foundation of every tolerable government. A constitutional\r\nmonarchy cannot exist without aristocracy, nor a healthful republic endure\r\nwith corruption of manners. The cry of equality is incompatible with\r\nCivilization, which, of necessity, contrasts poverty with wealth--and, in\r\nshort, whether it be an emperor or a mob that is to rule, Force is the sole\r\nhope of order, and the government is but an army.\r\n\r\n\"Impress, O Pisistratus! impress the value of patience as regards man and\r\nmen. You touch there on the kernel of the social system--the secret that\r\nfortifies the individual and disciplines the million. I care not, for my\r\npart, if you are tedious so long as you are earnest. Be minute and\r\ndetailed. Let the real human life, in its war with Circumstance, stand out.\r\nNever mind if one can read you but slowly--better chance of being less\r\nquickly forgotten. Patience, patience! By the soul of Epictetus, your\r\nreaders shall set you an example!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nLeonard had written twice to Mrs. Fairfield, twice to Riccabocca, and once\r\nto Mr. Dale; and the poor, proud boy could not bear to betray his\r\nhumiliation. He wrote as with cheerful spirits--as if perfectly satisfied\r\nwith his prospects. He said that he was well employed, in the midst of\r\nbooks, and that he had found kind friends. Then he turned from himself to\r\nwrite about those whom he addressed, and the affairs and interests of the\r\nquiet world wherein they lived. He did not give his own address, nor that\r\nof Mr. Prickett. He dated his letters from a small coffee-house near the\r\nbookseller, to which he occasionally went for his simple meals. He had a\r\nmotive in this. He did not desire to be found out. Mr. Dale replied for\r\nhimself and for Mrs. Fairfield, to the epistles addressed to these two.\r\nRiccabocca wrote also. Nothing could be more kind than the replies of both.\r\nThey came to Leonard in a very dark period in his life, and they\r\nstrengthened him in the noiseless battle with despair.\r\n\r\nIf there be a good in the world that we do without knowing it, without\r\nconjecturing the effect it may have upon a human soul, it is when we show\r\nkindness to the young in the first barren foot-path up the mountain of\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nLeonard's face resumed its serenity in his intercourse with his employer;\r\nbut he did not recover his boyish ingenuous frankness. The under-currents\r\nflowed again pure from the turbid soil, and the splintered fragments uptorn\r\nfrom the deep; but they were still too strong and too rapid to allow\r\ntransparency to the surface. And now he stood in the sublime world of\r\nbooks, still and earnest as a seer who invokes the dead. And thus, face to\r\nface with knowledge, hourly he discovered how little he knew. Mr. Prickett\r\nlent him such works as he selected and asked to take home with him. He\r\nspent whole nights in reading; and no longer desultorily. He read no more\r\npoetry, no more Lives of Poets. He read what poets must read if they desire\r\nto be--_Sapere principium et fons_--strict reasonings on the human mind;\r\nthe relations between motive and conduct, thought and action; the grave and\r\nsolemn truths of the past world; antiquities, history, philosophy. He was\r\ntaken out of himself. He was carried along the ocean of the universe. In\r\nthat ocean, O seeker, study the law of the tides; and seeing Chance\r\nnowhere--thought presiding over all--Fate, that dread phantom, shall vanish\r\nfrom creation, and Providence alone be visible in heaven and on earth!\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nThere was to be a considerable book-sale at a country-house one day's\r\njourney from London. Mr. Prickett meant to have attended it on his own\r\nbehalf, and that of several gentlemen who had given him commissions for\r\npurchase; but, on the morning fixed for his departure, he was seized with a\r\nsevere return of his old foe, the rheumatism. He requested Leonard to\r\nattend instead of himself. Leonard went, and was absent for the three days\r\nduring which the sale lasted. He returned late in the evening, and went at\r\nonce to Mr. Prickett's house. The shop was closed; he knocked at the\r\nprivate entrance; a strange person opened the door to him, and in reply to\r\nhis question if Mr. Prickett was at home, said with a long and funereal\r\nface, \"Young man, Mr. Prickett, senior, has gone to his long home, but Mr.\r\nRichard Prickett will see you.\"\r\n\r\nAt this moment a very grave-looking man, with lank hair, looked forth from\r\nthe side-door communicating between the shop and the passage, and then\r\nstepped forward--\"Come in, sir; you are my late uncle's assistant, Mr.\r\nFairfield, I suppose?\"\r\n\r\n\"Your late uncle! Heavens, sir, do I understand aright--can Mr. Prickett be\r\ndead since I left London?\"\r\n\r\n\"Died, sir, suddenly, last night. It was an affection of the heart; the\r\nDoctor thinks the rheumatism attacked that organ. He had small time to\r\nprovide for his departure, and his account books seem in sad disorder: I am\r\nhis nephew and executor.\"\r\n\r\nLeonard had now followed the nephew into the shop. There, still burned the\r\ngas lamp. The place seemed more dingy and cavernous than before. Death\r\nalways makes its presence felt in the house it visits.\r\n\r\nLeonard was greatly affected--and yet more, perhaps, by the utter want of\r\nfeeling which the nephew exhibited. In fact, the deceased had not been on\r\nfriendly terms with this person, his nearest relative and heir-at-law, who\r\nwas also a bookseller.\r\n\r\n\"You were engaged but by the week, I find, young man, on reference to my\r\nlate uncle's papers. He gave you L1 a week--a monstrous sum! I shall not\r\nrequire your services any further. I shall move these books to my own\r\nhouse. You will be good enough to send me a list of those you bought at the\r\nsale, and your account of travelling expenses, &c. What may be due to you\r\nshall be sent to your address. Good evening.\"\r\n\r\nLeonard went home, shocked and saddened at the sudden death of his kind\r\nemployer. He did not think much of himself that night; but, when he rose\r\nthe next day, he suddenly felt that the world of London lay before him,\r\nwithout a friend, without a calling, without an occupation for bread.\r\n\r\nThis time it was no fancied sorrow, no poetic dream disappointed. Before\r\nhim, gaunt and palpable, stood Famine.\r\n\r\nEscape!--yes. Back to the village; his mother's cottage; the exile's\r\ngarden; the radishes and the fount. Why could he not escape? Ask why\r\ncivilization cannot escape its ills, and fly back to the wild and the\r\nwigwam.\r\n\r\nLeonard could not have returned to the cottage, even if the Famine that\r\nfaced had already seized him with her skeleton hand. London releases not so\r\nreadily her fatal step-sons.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nOne day three persons were standing before an old book-stall in a passage\r\nleading from Oxford Street into Tottenham Court Road. Two were gentlemen;\r\nthe third, of the class and appearance of those who more habitually halt at\r\nold book-stalls.\r\n\r\n\"Look,\" said one of the gentlemen to the other, \"I have discovered here\r\nwhat I have searched for in vain the last ten years--the Horace of 1580,\r\nthe Horace of the Forty Commentators--a perfect treasury of learning, and\r\nmarked only fourteen shillings!\"\r\n\r\n\"Hush, Norreys,\" said the other, \"and observe what is yet more worth your\r\nstudy;\" and he pointed to the third bystander, whose face, sharp and\r\nattenuated, was bent with an absorbed, and as it were with a hungering\r\nattention over an old worm-eaten volume.\r\n\r\n\"What is the book, my Lord?\" whispered Mr. Norreys.\r\n\r\nHis companion smiled, and replied by another question, \"What is the man who\r\nreads the book?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Norreys moved a few paces, and looked over the student's shoulder.\r\n\"Preston's translation of BOETHIUS, _The Consolations of Philosophy_,\" he\r\nsaid, coming back to his friend.\r\n\r\n\"He looks as if he wanted all the consolations Philosophy can give him,\r\npoor boy.\"\r\n\r\nAt this moment a fourth passenger paused at the book-stall, and,\r\nrecognizing the pale student, placed his hand on his shoulder and said,\r\n\"Aha, young sir, we meet again. So poor Prickett is dead. But you are still\r\nhaunted by associations. Books--books--magnets to which all iron minds move\r\ninsensibly. What is this? BOETHIUS! Ah, a book written in prison, but a\r\nlittle time before the advent of the only philosopher who solves to the\r\nsimplest understanding every mystery of life----\"\r\n\r\n\"And that philosopher----\"\r\n\r\n\"Is Death!\" said Mr. Burley. \"How can you be dull enough to ask? Poor\r\nBoethius, rich, nobly born, a consul, his sons consuls--the world one smile\r\nto the Last Philosopher of Rome. Then suddenly, against this type of the\r\nold world's departing WISDOM, stands frowning the new world's grim genius,\r\nFORCE--Theodoric the Ostrogoth condemning Boethius the Schoolman; and\r\nBoethius, in his Pavian dungeon, holding a dialogue with the shade of\r\nAthenian Philosophy. It is the finest picture upon which lingers the\r\nglimmering of the Western golden day, before night rushes over time.\"\r\n\r\n\"And,\" said Mr. Norreys abruptly, \"Boethius comes back to us with the faint\r\ngleam of returning light, translated by Alfred the Great. And, again, as\r\nthe sun of knowledge bursts forth in all its splendor, by Queen Elizabeth.\r\nBoethius influences us as we stand in this passage; and that is the best of\r\nall the Consolations of Philosophy--eh, Mr. Burley?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Burley turned and bowed.\r\n\r\nThe two men looked at each other; you could not see a greater contrast. Mr.\r\nBurley, his gay green dress already shabby and soiled, with a rent in the\r\nskirts, and his face speaking of habitual night-cups. Mr. Norreys, neat and\r\nsomewhat precise in dress, with firm lean figure, and quiet, collected,\r\nvigorous energy in his eyes and aspect.\r\n\r\n\"If,\" replied Mr. Burley, \"a poor devil like me may argue with a gentleman\r\nwho may command his own price with the booksellers, I should say it is no\r\nconsolation at all, Mr. Norreys. And I should like to see any man of sense\r\naccept the condition of Boethius in his prison, with some strangler or\r\nheadsman waiting behind the door, upon the promised proviso that he should\r\nbe translated, centuries afterwards, by Kings and by Queens, and help\r\nindirectly to influence the minds of Northern barbarians, babbling about\r\nhim in an alley, jostled by passers-by who never heard the name of\r\nBoethius, and who don't care a fig for philosophy. Your servant,\r\nsir,--young man, come and talk.\"\r\n\r\nBurley hooked his arm within Leonard's, and led the boy passively away.\r\n\r\n\"That is a clever young man,\" said Harley L'Estrange. \"But I am sorry to\r\nsee yon young student, with his bright earnest eyes, and his lip that has\r\nthe quiver of passion and enthusiasm, leaning on the arm of a guide who\r\nseems disenchanted of all that gives purpose to learning and links\r\nphilosophy with use to the world. Who, and what is this clever man whom you\r\ncall Burley?\"\r\n\r\n\"A man who might have been famous, if he had condescended to be\r\nrespectable! The boy listening to us both so attentively interested _me_\r\ntoo--I should like to have the making of him. But I must buy this Horace.\"\r\n\r\nThe shopman, lurking within his hole like a spider for flies, was now\r\ncalled out. And when Mr. Norreys had bought the Horace, and given an\r\naddress where to send it, Harley asked the shopman if he knew the young man\r\nwho had been reading Boethius.\r\n\r\n\"Only by sight. He has come here every day the last week, and spends hours\r\nat the stall. When once he fastens on a book, he reads it through.\"\r\n\r\n\"And never buys?\" said Mr. Norreys.\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\" said the shopman, with a good-natured smile, \"they who buy seldom\r\nread. The poor boy pays me twopence a-day to read as long as he pleases. I\r\nwould not take it, but he is proud.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have known men amass great learning in that way,\" said Mr. Norreys.\r\n\"Yes, I should like to have that boy in my hands. And now, my lord, I am at\r\nyour service, and we shall go to the studio of your artist.\"\r\n\r\nThe two gentlemen walked on towards one of the streets out of Fitzroy\r\nSquare.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes more Harley L'Estrange was in his element, seated\r\ncarelessly on a deal table, smoking his cigar, and discussing art with the\r\ngusto of a man who honestly loved, and the taste of a man who thoroughly\r\nunderstood it. The young artist, in his dressing robe, adding slow touch\r\nupon touch, paused often to listen the better. And Henry Norreys, enjoying\r\nthe brief respite from a life of great labor, was gladly reminded of idle\r\nhours under rosy skies; for these three men had formed their friendship in\r\nItaly, where the bands of friendship are woven by the hands of the Graces.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nLeonard and Mr. Burley walked on into the suburbs round the north road from\r\nLondon, and Mr. Burley offered to find literary employment for Leonard--an\r\noffer eagerly accepted.\r\n\r\nThen they went into a public house by the wayside. Burley demanded a\r\nprivate room, called for pen, ink, and paper; and placing these implements\r\nbefore Leonard, said, \"Write what you please, in prose, five sheets of\r\nletter paper, twenty-two lines to a page--neither more nor less.\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot write so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tut, 'tis for bread.\"\r\n\r\nThe boy's face crimsoned.\r\n\r\n\"I must forget that,\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"There is an arbor in the garden under a weeping ash,\" returned Burley. \"Go\r\nthere, and fancy yourself in Arcadia.\"\r\n\r\nLeonard was too pleased to obey. He found out the little arbor at one end\r\nof a deserted bowling-green. All was still--the hedgerow shut out the sight\r\nof the inn. The sun lay warm on the grass, and glinted pleasantly through\r\nthe leaves of the ash. And Leonard there wrote the first essay from his\r\nhand as Author by profession. What was it that he wrote? His dreamy\r\nimpressions of London? an anathema on the streets, and its hearts of stone?\r\nmurmurs against poverty? dark elegies on fate?\r\n\r\nOh, no! little knowest thou true genius, if thou askest such questions, or\r\nthinkest that there, under the weeping ash, the task-work for bread was\r\nremembered; or that the sunbeam glinted but over the practical world,\r\nwhich, vulgar, and sordid, lay around. Leonard wrote a fairy tale--one of\r\nthe loveliest you can conceive, with a delicate touch of playful humor--in\r\na style all flowered over with happy fancies. He smiled as he wrote the\r\nlast word--he was happy. In rather more than an hour Mr. Burley came to\r\nhim, and found him with that smile on his lips.\r\n\r\nMr. Burley had a glass of brandy and water in his hand; it was his third.\r\nHe too smiled--he too looked happy. He read the paper aloud, and well. He\r\nwas very complimentary. \"You will do!\" said he, clapping Leonard on the\r\nback. \"Perhaps some day you will catch my one-eyed perch.\" Then he folded\r\nup the MS., scribbled off a note, put the whole in one envelope--and they\r\nreturned to London.\r\n\r\nMr. Burley disappeared within a dingy office near Fleet Street, on which\r\nwas inscribed--\"Office of the _Beehive_,\" and soon came forth with a golden\r\nsovereign in his hand--Leonard's first-fruits. Leonard thought Peru lay\r\nbefore him. He accompanied Mr. Burley to that gentleman's lodging in Maida\r\nHill. The walk had been very long; Leonard was not fatigued. He listened\r\nwith a livelier attention than before to Burley's talk. And when they\r\nreached the apartments of the latter, and Mr. Burley sent to the cookshop,\r\nand their joint supper was taken out of the golden sovereign, Leonard felt\r\nproud, and for the first time for weeks he laughed the heart's laugh. The\r\ntwo writers grew more and more intimate and cordial. And there was a vast\r\ndeal in Burley by which any young man might be made the wiser. There was no\r\napparent evidence of poverty in the apartment--clean, new, well furnished;\r\nbut all things in the most horrible litter--all speaking of the huge\r\nliterary sloven.\r\n\r\nFor several days Leonard almost lived in those rooms. He wrote\r\ncontinuously--save when Burley's conversation fascinated him into idleness.\r\nNay, it was not idleness--his knowledge grew larger as he listened; but the\r\ncynicism of the talker began slowly to work its way. That cynicism in which\r\nthere was no faith, no hope, no vivifying breath from Glory--from Religion.\r\nThe cynicism of the Epicurean, more degraded in his style than ever was\r\nDiogenes in his tub; and yet presented with such ease and such\r\neloquence--with such art and such mirth--so adorned with illustration and\r\nanecdote, so unconscious of debasement.\r\n\r\nStrange and dread philosophy--that made it a maxim to squander the gifts of\r\nmind on the mere care for matter, and fit the soul to live but as from day\r\nto day, with its scornful cry, \"A fig for immortality and laurels!\" An\r\nauthor for bread! Oh, miserable calling! was there something grand and\r\nholy, after all, even in Chatterton's despair!\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nThe villanous _Beehive_! Bread was worked out of it, certainly; but fame,\r\nbut hope for the future--certainly not. Milton's _Paradise Lost_ would have\r\nperished without a sound, had it appeared in the _Beehive_.\r\n\r\nFine things were there in a fragmentary crude state, composed by Burley\r\nhimself. At the end of a week they were dead and forgotten--never read by\r\none man of education and taste; taken simultaneously and indifferently with\r\nshallow politics and wretched essays, yet selling, perhaps, twenty or\r\nthirty thousand copies--an immense sale; and nothing got out of them but\r\nbread and brandy!\r\n\r\n\"What more would you have?\" cried John Burley. \"Did not stern old Sam\r\nJohnson say he could never write but from want?\"\r\n\r\n\"He might say it,\" answered Leonard; \"but he never meant posterity to\r\nbelieve him. And he would have died of want, I suspect, rather than have\r\nwritten _Rasselas_ for the _Beehive_! Want is a grand thing,\" continued the\r\nboy, thoughtfully. \"A parent of grand things. Necessity is strong, and\r\nshould give us its own strength; but Want should shatter asunder, with its\r\nvery writhings, the walls of our prison-house, and not sit contented with\r\nthe allowance the jail gives us in exchange for our work.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is no prison-house to a man who calls upon Bacchus--stay--I will\r\ntranslate to you Schiller's Dithyramb. 'Then see I Bacchus--then up come\r\nCupid and Phoebus, and all the Celestials are filling my dwelling.'\"\r\n\r\nBreaking into impromptu careless rhymes, Burley threw off a rude but\r\nspirited translation of that divine lyric.\r\n\r\n\"O materialist!\" cried the boy, with his bright eyes suffused. \"Schiller\r\ncalls on the gods to take him to their heaven with him; and ye would debase\r\nthe Gods to a gin palace.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ho, ho!\" cried Burley with his giant laugh. \"Drink, and you will\r\nunderstand the Dithyramb.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nSuddenly one morning, as Leonard sat with Burley, a fashionable cabriolet,\r\nwith a very handsome horse, stopped at the door--a loud knock--a quick step\r\non the stairs, and Randal Leslie entered. Leonard recognized him and\r\nstarted. Randal glanced at him in surprise, and then, with a tact that\r\nshowed he had already learned to profit by London life, after shaking hands\r\nwith Burley, approached, and said with some successful attempt at ease,\r\n\"Unless I am not mistaken, sir, we have met before. If you remember me, I\r\nhope all boyish quarrels are forgotten?\"\r\n\r\nLeonard bowed, and his heart was still good enough to be softened.\r\n\r\n\"Where could you two ever have met?\" asked Burley.\r\n\r\n\"In a village green, and in single combat,\" answered Randal, smiling; and\r\nhe told the story of the Battle of the Stocks with a well-bred jest on\r\nhimself. Burley laughed at the story. \"But,\" said he, when this laugh was\r\nover, \"my young friend had better have remained guardian of the village\r\nstocks, than come to London in search of such fortune as lies at the bottom\r\nof an inkhorn.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah,\" said Randal, with the secret contempt which men elaborately\r\ncultivated are apt to feel for those who seek to educate themselves--\"ah,\r\nyou make literature your calling, sir? At what school did you conceive a\r\ntaste for letters?--not very common at our great public schools.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am at school now for the first time,\" answered Leonard, dryly.\r\n\r\n\"Experience is the best school-mistress,\" said Burley; \"and that was the\r\nmaxim of Goethe, who had book-learning enough, in all conscience.\"\r\n\r\nRandal slightly shrugged his shoulders, and, without wasting another\r\nthought on Leonard, peasant-born and self-taught, took his seat, and began\r\nto talk to Burley upon a political question, which made then the war-cry\r\nbetween the two great Parliamentary parties. It was a subject in which\r\nBurley showed much general knowledge; and Randal, seeming to differ from\r\nhim, drew forth alike his information and his argumentative powers. The\r\nconversation lasted more than an hour.\r\n\r\n\"I can't quite agree with you,\" said Randal, taking his leave; \"but you\r\nmust allow me to call again--will the same hour to-morrow suit you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Burley.\r\n\r\nAway went the young man in his cabriolet. Leonard watched him from the\r\nwindow.\r\n\r\nFor five days, consecutively, did Randal call and discuss the question in\r\nall its bearings; and Burley, after the second day got interested in the\r\nmatter, looked up his authorities--refreshed his memory and even spent an\r\nhour or two in the Library of the British Museum.\r\n\r\nBy the fifth day, Burley had really exhausted all that could well be said\r\non his side of the question.\r\n\r\nLeonard, during these colloquies, had sat apart, seemingly absorbed in\r\nreading, and secretly stung by Randal's disregard of his presence. For\r\nindeed that young man, in his superb self-esteem, and in the absorption of\r\nhis ambitious projects, scarce felt even curiosity as to Leonard's rise\r\nabove his earlier station, and looked on him as a mere journeyman of\r\nBurley's. But the self-taught are keen and quick observers. And Leonard had\r\nremarked that Randal seemed more as one playing a part for some private\r\npurpose, than arguing in earnest; and that when he rose and said, \"Mr.\r\nBurley, you have convinced me,\" it was not with the modesty of a sincere\r\nreasoner, but the triumph of one who has gained his end. But so struck,\r\nmeanwhile, was our unheeded and silent listener, with Burley's power of\r\ngeneralization, and the wide surface over which his information extended,\r\nthat when Randal left the room the boy looked at the slovenly purposeless\r\nman, and said aloud--\"True; knowledge is _not_ power.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly not,\" said Burley, dryly--\"the weakest thing in the world.\"\r\n\r\n\"Knowledge is power,\" muttered Randal Leslie, as, with a smile on his lip,\r\nhe drove from the door.\r\n\r\nNot many days after this last interview there appeared a short pamphlet;\r\nanonymous, but one which made a great impression on the town. It was on the\r\nsubject discussed between Randal and Burley. It was quoted at great length\r\nin the newspapers. And Burley started to his feet one morning, and\r\nexclaimed, \"My own thoughts! my very words! Who the devil is this\r\npamphleteer?\" Leonard took the newspaper from Burley's hand. The most\r\nflattering encomiums preceded the extracts, and the extracts were as\r\nstereotypes of Burley's talk.\r\n\r\n\"Can you doubt the author?\" cried Leonard, in deep disgust and ingenuous\r\nscorn. \"The young man who came to steal your brains, and turn your\r\nknowledge----\"\r\n\r\n\"Into power,\" interrupted Burley, with a laugh, but it was a laugh of pain.\r\n\"Well, this was very mean; I shall tell him so when he comes.\"\r\n\r\n\"He will come no more,\" said Leonard. Nor did Randal come again. But he\r\nsent Mr. Burley a copy of the pamphlet with a polite note, saying, with\r\ncandid but careless acknowledgment, that \"he had profited much by Mr.\r\nBurley's hints and remarks.\"\r\n\r\nAnd now it was in all the papers, that the pamphlet which had made so great\r\na noise was by a very young man, Mr. Audley Egerton's relation, and high\r\nhopes were expressed of the future career of Mr. Randal Leslie.\r\n\r\nBurley still attempted to laugh, and still his pain was visible. Leonard\r\nmost cordially despised and hated Randal Leslie, and his heart moved to\r\nBurley with noble but perilous compassion. In his desire to soothe and\r\ncomfort the man whom he deemed cheated out of fame, he forgot the caution\r\nhe had hitherto imposed on himself, and yielded more and more to the charm\r\nof that wasted intellect. He accompanied Burley now where he went to spend\r\nhis evenings, and more and more--though gradually, and with many a recoil\r\nand self-rebuke--there crept over him the cynic's contempt for glory, amid\r\nmiserable philosophy of debased content.\r\n\r\nRandal had risen into grave repute upon the strength of Burley's knowledge.\r\nBut, had Burley written the pamphlet, would the same repute have attended\r\n_him_? Certainly not. Randal Leslie brought to that knowledge qualities all\r\nhis own--a style simple, strong, and logical; a certain tone of good\r\nsociety, and allusions to men and to parties that showed his connection\r\nwith a cabinet minister, and proved that he had profited no less by\r\nEgerton's talk than Burley's.\r\n\r\nHad Burley written the pamphlet, it would have showed more genius, it would\r\nhave had humor and wit, but have been so full of whims and quips, sins\r\nagainst taste, and defects in earnestness, that it would have failed to\r\ncreate any serious sensation. Here, then, there was something else besides\r\nknowledge, by which knowledge became power. Knowledge must not smell of the\r\nbrandy bottle.\r\n\r\nRandal Leslie might be mean in his plagiarism, but he turned the useless\r\ninto use. And so far he was original.\r\n\r\nBut one's admiration, after all, rests where Leonard's rested--with the\r\npoor, shabby, riotous, lawless, big, fallen man.\r\n\r\nBurley took himself off to the Brent, and fished again for the one-eyed\r\nperch. Leonard accompanied him. His feelings were indeed different from\r\nwhat they had been when he had reclined under the old tree, and talked with\r\nHelen of the future. But it was almost pathetic to see how Burley's nature\r\nseemed to alter, as he strayed along the banks of the rivulet, and talked\r\nof his own boyhood. The man then seemed restored to something of the\r\ninnocence of the child. He cared, in truth, little for the perch, which\r\ncontinued intractable, but he enjoyed the air and the sky, the rustling\r\ngrass and the murmuring waters. These excursions to the haunts of youth\r\nseemed to rebaptize him, and then his eloquence took a pastoral character,\r\nand Isaac Walton himself would have loved to hear him. But as he got back\r\ninto the smoke of the metropolis, and the gas lamps made him forget the\r\nruddy sunset, and the soft evening star, the gross habits reassumed their\r\nsway; and on he went with his swaggering, reckless step to the orgies in\r\nwhich his abused intellect flamed forth, and then sank into the socket\r\nquenched and rayless.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nHelen was seized with profound and anxious sadness. Leonard had been three\r\nor four times to see her, and each time she saw a change in him that\r\nexcited all her fears. He seemed, it is true, more shrewd, more\r\nworldly-wise, more fitted, it might be, for coarse, daily life; but, on the\r\nother hand, the freshness and glory of his youth were waning slowly. His\r\naspirings drooped earthward. He had not mastered the Practical, and moulded\r\nits uses with the strong hand of the Spiritual Architect, of the Ideal\r\nBuilder: the Practical was overpowering himself. She grew pale when he\r\ntalked of Burley, and shuddered, poor little Helen! when she found he was\r\ndaily and almost nightly in a companionship which, with her native, honest\r\nprudence, she saw so unsuited to strengthen him in his struggles, and aid\r\nhim against temptation. She almost groaned when, pressing him as to his\r\npecuniary means, she found his old terror of death seemed fading away, and\r\nthe solid, healthful principles he had taken from his village were\r\nloosening fast. Under all, it is true, there was what a wiser and older\r\nperson than Helen would have hailed as the redeeming promise. But that\r\nsomething was _grief_--a sublime grief In his own sense of falling--in his\r\nown impotence against the Fate he had provoked and coveted. The sublimity\r\nof that grief Helen could not detect: she saw only that it _was_ grief, and\r\nshe grieved with it, letting it excuse every fault--making her more anxious\r\nto comfort, in order that she might save. Even from the first, when Leonard\r\nhad exclaimed, \"Ah, Helen, why did you ever leave me?\" she had revolved the\r\nidea of return to him; and when in the boy's last visit he told her that\r\nBurley, persecuted by duns, was about to fly from his present lodgings, and\r\ntake his abode with Leonard in the room she had left vacant, all doubt was\r\nover. She resolved to sacrifice the safety and shelter of the home assured\r\nher. She resolved to come back and share Leonard's penury and struggles,\r\nand save the old room, wherein she had prayed for him, from the tempter's\r\ndangerous presence. Should she burden him? No; she had assisted her father\r\nby many little female arts in needle and fancy work. She had improved\r\nherself in these during her sojourn with Miss Starke. She could bring her\r\nshare to the common stock. Possessed with this idea, she determined to\r\nrealize it before the day on which Leonard had told her Burley was to move\r\nhis quarters. Accordingly she rose very early one morning; she wrote a\r\npretty and grateful note to Miss Starke, who was fast asleep, left it on\r\nthe table, and before any one was astir, stole from the house, her little\r\nbundle on her arm. She lingered an instant at the garden-gate, with a\r\nremorseful sentiment--a feeling that she had ill-repaid the cold and prim\r\nprotection that Miss Starke had shown her. But sisterly love carried all\r\nbefore it. She closed the gate with a sigh, and went on.\r\n\r\nShe arrived at the lodging-house before Leonard was up, took possession of\r\nher old chamber, and, presenting herself to Leonard as he was about to go\r\nforth, said, (story-teller that she was,)--\"I am sent away, brother, and I\r\nhave to come to you to take care of me. Do not let us part again. But you\r\nmust be very cheerful and very happy, or I shall think that I am sadly in\r\nyour way.\"\r\n\r\nLeonard at first did look cheerful, and even happy; but then he thought of\r\nBurley, and then of his own means of supporting her, and was embarrassed,\r\nand began questioning Helen as to the possibility of a reconciliation with\r\nMiss Starke. And Helen said gravely, \"Impossible--do not ask it, and do not\r\ngo near her.\"\r\n\r\nThen Leonard thought she had been humbled and insulted, and remembered that\r\nshe was a gentleman's child, and felt for her wounded pride--he was so\r\nproud himself. Yet still he was embarrassed.\r\n\r\n\"Shall I keep the purse again, Leonard?\" said Helen coaxingly.\r\n\r\n\"Alas!\" replied Leonard, \"the purse is empty.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is very naughty in the purse,\" said Helen, \"since you put so much\r\ninto it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I!\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you not say you made, at least, a guinea a-week?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; but Burley takes the money; and then, poor fellow! as I owe all to\r\nhim, I have not the heart to prevent his spending it as he likes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Please, I wish you could settle the month's rent,\" said the landlady,\r\nsuddenly showing herself. She said it civilly, but with firmness.\r\n\r\nLeonard colored. \"It shall be paid to-day.\"\r\n\r\nThen he pressed his hat on his head, and putting Helen gently aside, went\r\nforth.\r\n\r\n\"Speak to _me_ in future, kind Mrs. Smedley,\" said Helen, with the air of a\r\nhousewife. \"_He_ is always in study, and must not be disturbed.\"\r\n\r\nThe landlady--a good woman, though she liked her rent--smiled benignly. She\r\nwas fond of Helen, whom she had known of old.\r\n\r\n\"I am so glad you are come back; and perhaps now the young man will not\r\nkeep such late hours. I meant to give him warning, but----\"\r\n\r\n\"But he will be a great man one of these days, and you must bear with him\r\nnow.\" And Helen kissed Mrs. Smedley, and sent her away half inclined to\r\ncry.\r\n\r\nThen Helen busied herself in the rooms. She found her father's box, which\r\nhad been duly forwarded. She re-examined its contents, and wept as she\r\ntouched each humble and pious relic. But her father's memory itself thus\r\nseemed to give this home a sanction which the former had not; and she rose\r\nquietly and began mechanically to put things in order, sighing as she saw\r\nall so neglected, till she came to the rose-tree, and that alone showed\r\nheed and care. \"Dear Leonard!\" she murmured, and the smile resettled on her\r\nlips.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nNothing, perhaps, could have severed Leonard from Burley but Helen's return\r\nto his care. It was impossible for him, even had there been another room in\r\nthe house vacant, (which there was not,) to install this noisy, riotous son\r\nof the Muse by Bacchus, talking at random, and smelling of spirits, in the\r\nsame dwelling with an innocent, delicate, timid, female child. And Leonard\r\ncould not leave her alone all the twenty-four hours. She restored a home to\r\nhim, and imposed its duties. He, therefore, told Mr. Burley that in future\r\nhe should write and study in his own room, and hinted with many a blush,\r\nand as delicately as he could, that it seemed to him that whatever he\r\nobtained from his pen ought to be halved with Burley, to whose interest he\r\nowed the employment, and from whose books or whose knowledge he took what\r\nhelped to maintain it; but that the other half, if his, he could no longer\r\nafford to spend upon feasts or libations. He had another to provide for.\r\n\r\nBurley pooh-poohed the notion of taking half his coadjutor's earning, with\r\nmuch grandeur, but spoke very fretfully of Leonard's sober appropriation of\r\nthe other half; and, though a good-natured, warm-hearted man, felt\r\nextremely indignant against the sudden interposition of poor Helen.\r\nHowever, Leonard was firm; and then Burley grew sullen, and so they parted.\r\nBut the rent was still to be paid. How? Leonard for the first time thought\r\nof the pawn-broker. He had clothes to spare, and Riccabocca's watch. No;\r\nthat last he shrank from applying to such base uses.\r\n\r\nHe went home at noon and met Helen at the street door. She too had been\r\nout, and her soft cheek was rosy red with unwonted exercise and the sense\r\nof joy. She had still preserved the few gold pieces which Leonard had taken\r\nback to her on his first visit to Miss Starke's. She had now gone out and\r\nbought wools and implements for work; and meanwhile she had paid the rent.\r\n\r\nLeonard did not object to the work, but he blushed deeply when he knew\r\nabout the rent, and was very angry. He payed back to her that night what\r\nshe had advanced; and Helen wept silently at his pride, and wept more when\r\nshe saw the next day a woeful hiatus in his wardrobe.\r\n\r\nBut Leonard now worked at home, and worked resolutely; and Helen sat by his\r\nside, working too; so that next day, and the next, slipped peacefully away,\r\nand in the evening of the second be asked her to walk out in the fields.\r\nShe sprang up joyously at the invitation, when bang went the door, and in\r\nreeled John Burley--drunk;--And so drunk!\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nAnd with Burley there reeled in another man--a friend of his--a man who had\r\nbeen a wealthy trader and once well to do, but who, unluckily, had literary\r\ntastes, and was fond of hearing Burley talk. So, since he had known the\r\nwit, his business had fallen from him, and he had passed through the\r\nBankrupt Court. A very shabby-looking dog he was, indeed, and his nose was\r\nredder than Burley's.\r\n\r\nJohn made a drunken dash at poor Helen. \"So you are the Pentheus in\r\npetticoats who defies Bacchus,\" cried he; and therewith he roared out a\r\nverse from Euripides. Helen ran away, and Leonard interposed.\r\n\r\n\"For shame, Burley!\"\r\n\r\n\"He's drunk,\" said Mr. Douce the bankrupt trader--\"very drunk--don't\r\nmind--him. I say, sir, I hope we don't intrude. Sit still, Burley, sit\r\nstill and talk, do--that's a good man. You should hear him ta--ta--talk,\r\nsir.\"\r\n\r\nLeonard meanwhile had got Helen out of the room, into her own, and begged\r\nher not to be alarmed, and keep the door locked. He then returned to\r\nBurley, who had seated himself on the bed, trying wondrous hard to keep\r\nhimself upright; while Mr. Douce was striving to light a short pipe that he\r\ncarried in his buttonhole--without having filled it--and, naturally failing\r\nin that attempt, was now beginning to weep.\r\n\r\nLeonard was deeply shocked and revolted for Helen's sake: but it was\r\nhopeless to make Burley listen to reason. And how could the boy turn out of\r\nhis room the man to whom he was under obligations?\r\n\r\nMeanwhile there smote upon Helen's shrinking ears loud jarring talk and\r\nmaudlin laughter, and cracked attempts at jovial songs. Then she heard Mrs.\r\nSmedley in Leonard's room, remonstrating, and Burley's laugh was louder\r\nthan before, and Mrs. Smedley, who was a meek woman, evidently got\r\nfrightened, and was heard in precipitate retreat. Long and loud talk\r\nrecommenced. Burley's great voice predominant, Mr. Douce chiming in with\r\nhiccupy broken treble. Hour after hour thus lasted, for want of the drink\r\nthat would have brought it to a premature close. And Burley gradually began\r\nto talk himself somewhat sober. Then Mr. Douce was heard descending the\r\nstairs, and silence followed. At dawn, Leonard knocked at Helen's door. She\r\nopened it at once, for she had not gone to bed.\r\n\r\n\"Helen,\" said he very sadly, \"you cannot continue here, I must find out\r\nsome proper home for you. This man has served me when all London was\r\nfriendless, and he tells me that he has nowhere else to go--that the\r\nbailiffs are after him. He has now fallen asleep. I will go and find you\r\nsome lodging close at hand--for I cannot expel him who has protected me;\r\nand yet you cannot be under the same roof with him. My own good angel, I\r\nmust lose you.\"\r\n\r\nHe did not wait for her answer, but hurried down the stairs.\r\n\r\nThe morning looked through the shutterless panes in Leonard's garret, and\r\nthe birds began to chirp from the elm-tree, when Burley rose, and shook\r\nhimself, and stared round. He could not quite make out where he was. He got\r\nhold of the water-jug, which he emptied at three draughts, and felt greatly\r\nrefreshed. He then began to reconnoitre the chamber--looked at Leonard's\r\nMSS.--peeped into the drawers--wondered where the devil Leonard himself had\r\ngone to--and finally amused himself by throwing down the fire-irons,\r\nringing the bell, and making all the noise he could, in the hopes of\r\nattracting the attention of somebody or other, and procuring himself his\r\nmorning dram.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this _charivari_ the door opened softly, but as if with a\r\nresolute hand, and the small quiet form of Helen stood before the\r\nthreshold. Burley turned round, and the two looked at each other for some\r\nmoments with silent scrutiny.\r\n\r\n_Burley_, (composing his features into their most friendly\r\nexpression.)--\"Come hither, my dear. So you are the little girl whom I saw\r\nwith Leonard on the banks of the Brent, and you have come back to live with\r\nhim--and I have come to live with him too. You shall be our little\r\nhousekeeper, and I will tell you the story of Prince Prettyman, and a\r\ngreat, many others not to be found in _Mother Goose_. Meanwhile, my dear\r\nlittle girl, here is sixpence--just run out and change this for its worth\r\nin rum.\"\r\n\r\n_Helen_, (coming slowly up to Mr. Burley, and still gazing earnestly into\r\nhis face.)--\"Ah, sir, Leonard says you have a kind heart, and that you have\r\nserved him--he cannot ask you to leave the house; and so I, who have never\r\nserved him, am to go hence and live alone.\"\r\n\r\n_Burley_, (moved.)--\"You go, my little lady?--and why? Can we not all live\r\ntogether?\"\r\n\r\n_Helen._--\"No sir. I left every thing to come to Leonard, for we had met\r\nfirst at my father's grave. But you rob me of him, and I have no other\r\nfriend on earth.\"\r\n\r\n_Burley_, (discomposed.)--\"Explain, yourself. Why must you leave him\r\nbecause I come?\"\r\n\r\nHelen looks at Mr. Burley again, long and wistfully, but makes no answer.\r\n\r\n_Burley_, (with a gulp.)--\"Is it because he thinks I am not fit company for\r\nyou?\"\r\n\r\nHelen bowed her head.\r\n\r\nBurley winced, and after a moment's pause said,--\"He is right.\"\r\n\r\n_Helen_, (obeying the impulse of her heart, springs forward and takes\r\nBurley's hand.)--\"Ah, sir,\" she cried, \"before he knew you he was so\r\ndifferent--then he was cheerful--then, even when his first disappointment\r\ncame, I grieved and wept; but I felt he would conquer still--for his heart\r\nwas so good and pure. Oh, sir, don't think I reproach you; but what is to\r\nbecome of him if--if--No, it is not for myself I speak. I know that if I\r\nwas here, that if he had me to care for, he would come home early and--work\r\npatiently--and--and--that I might save him. But now when I am gone, and you\r\nwith him--you to whom he is grateful, you whom he would follow against his\r\nown conscience, (you must see that, sir,)--what is to become of him?\"\r\n\r\nHelen's voice died in sobs.\r\n\r\nBurley took three or four long strides through the room--he was greatly\r\nagitated. \"I am a demon,\" he murmured. \"I never saw it before--but it is\r\ntrue--I should be this boy's ruin.\" Tears stood in his eyes, he paused\r\nabruptly, made a clutch at his hat, and turned to the door.\r\n\r\nHelen stopped the way, and taking him gently by the arm, said,--\"Oh, sir,\r\nforgive me--I have pained you;\" and looked up at him with a compassionate\r\nexpression, that indeed made the child's sweet face as that of an angel.\r\n\r\nBurley bent down as if to kiss her, and then drew back--perhaps with a\r\nsentiment that his lips were not worthy to touch that innocent brow.\r\n\r\n\"If I had had a sister--a child like you, little one,\" he muttered,\r\n\"perhaps I too might have been saved in time. Now----\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, now you may stay, sir; I don't fear you any more.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no; you would fear me again ere night time, and I might not be always\r\nin the right mood to listen to a voice like yours, child. Your Leonard has\r\na noble heart and rare gifts. He should rise yet, and he shall, I will not\r\ndrag him into the mire. Good-bye--you will see me no more.\" He broke from\r\nHelen, cleared the stairs with a bound, and was out of the house.\r\n\r\nWhen Leonard returned he was surprised to hear his unwelcome guest was\r\ngone--but Helen did not venture to tell him of her interposition. She knew\r\ninstinctively how such officiousness would mortify and offend the pride of\r\nman; but she never again spoke harshly of poor Burley. Leonard supposed\r\nthat he should either see or hear of the humorist in the course of the\r\nday. Finding he did not, he went in search of him at his old haunts; but no\r\ntrace. He inquired at the _Beehive_ if they knew there of his new address,\r\nbut no tidings of Burley could be obtained.\r\n\r\nAs he came home disappointed and anxious, for he felt uneasy as to the\r\ndisappearance of his wild friend, Mrs. Smedley met him at the door.\r\n\r\n\"Please, sir, suit yourself with another lodging,\" said she. \"I can have no\r\nsuch singings and shoutings going on at night in my house. And that poor\r\nlittle girl too! you should be ashamed of yourself.\"\r\n\r\nLeonard frowned and passed by.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, on leaving Helen, Burley strode on; and, as if by some better\r\ninstinct, for he was unconscious of his own steps, he took the way towards\r\nthe still green haunts of his youth. When he paused at length, he was\r\nalready before the door of a rural cottage, standing alone in the midst of\r\nfields, with a little farm-yard at the back; and far through the trees in\r\nfront was caught a glimpse of the winding Brent.\r\n\r\nWith this cottage Burley was familiar; it was inhabited by a good old\r\ncouple who had known him from a boy. There he habitually left his rods and\r\nfishing-tackle; there, for intervals in his turbid, riotous life, he had\r\nsojourned for two or three days together--fancying, the first day that the\r\ncountry was a heaven, and convinced before the third that it was a\r\npurgatory.\r\n\r\nAn old woman of neat and tidy exterior came forth to greet him.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, Master John,\" said she, clasping his nerveless hand--\"well, the fields\r\nbe pleasant now--I hope you are come to stay a bit? Do; it will freshen\r\nyou; you lose all the fine color you had once, in Lunnon town.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will stay with you, my kind friend,\" said Burley, with unusual\r\nmeekness--\"I can have the old room, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes, come and look at it. I never let it now to any one but you--never\r\nhave let it since the dear beautiful lady with the angel's face went away.\r\nPoor thing, what could have become of her?\"\r\n\r\nThus speaking, while Burley listened not, the old woman drew him within the\r\ncottage, and led him up the stairs into a room that might have well become\r\na better house, for it was furnished with taste, and even elegance. A small\r\ncabinet pianoforte stood opposite the fire-place, and the window looked\r\nupon pleasant meads and tangled hedgerows, and the narrow windings of the\r\nblue rivulet. Burley sank down exhausted, and gazed wistfully from the\r\ncasement.\r\n\r\n\"You have not breakfasted?\" said the hostess anxiously.\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, the eggs are fresh laid, and you would like a rasher of bacon,\r\nMaster John? And if you _will_ have brandy in your tea, I have some that\r\nyou left long ago in your own bottle.\"\r\n\r\nBurley shook his head. \"No brandy, Mrs. Goodyer; only fresh milk. I will\r\nsee whether I can yet coax Nature.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Goodyer did not know what was meant by coaxing Nature, but she said,\r\n\"Pray do, Master John,\" and vanished.\r\n\r\nThat day Burley went out with his rod, and he fished hard for the one-eyed\r\nperch; but in vain. Then he roved along the stream with his hands in his\r\npockets, whistling. He returned to the cottage at sunset, partook of the\r\nfare provided for him, abstained from the brandy, and felt dreadfully low.\r\nHe called for pen, ink, and paper, and sought to write, but he could not\r\nachieve two lines. He summoned Mrs. Goodyer, \"Tell your husband to come and\r\nsit and talk.\"\r\n\r\nUp came old Jacob Goodyer, and the great wit bade him tell him all the news\r\nof the village. Jacob obeyed willingly, and Burley at last fell asleep. The\r\nnext day it was much the same, only at dinner he had up the brandy bottle,\r\nand finished it; and he did _not_ have up Jacob, but he contrived to write.\r\n\r\nThe third day it rained incessantly.\r\n\r\n\"Have you no books, Mrs. Goodyer?\" asked poor John Burley.\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes; some that the dear lady left behind her; and perhaps you would\r\nlike to look at some papers in her own writing?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, not the papers--all women scribble, and all scribble the same things.\r\nGet me the books.\"\r\n\r\nThe books were brought up--poetry and essays--John knew them by heart. He\r\nlooked out on the rain, and at evening the rain had ceased. He rushed to\r\nhis hat and fled.\r\n\r\n\"Nature, Nature!\" he exclaimed when he was out in the air, and hurrying by\r\nthe dripping hedgerows, \"you are not to be coaxed by me! I have jilted you\r\nshamefully, I own it; you are a female and unforgiving. I don't complain.\r\nYou may be very pretty, but you are the stupidest and most tiresome\r\ncompanion that ever I met with. Thank heaven, I am not married to you!\"\r\n\r\nThus John Burley made his way into town, and paused at the first\r\npublic-house. Out of that house he came with a jovial air, and on he strode\r\ntowards the heart of London. Now he is in Leicester Square, and he gazes on\r\nthe foreigners who stalk that region, and hums a tune; and now from yonder\r\nalley two forms emerge, and dog his careless footsteps; now through the\r\nmaze of passages towards St. Martin's he threads his path, and,\r\nanticipating an orgy as he nears his favorite haunts, jingles the silver in\r\nhis pockets; and now the two forms are at his heels.\r\n\r\n\"Hail to thee, O Freedom!\" muttered John Burley; \"thy dwelling is in\r\ncities, and thy palace is the tavern.\"\r\n\r\n\"In the king's name,\" quoth a gruff voice; and John Burley feels the horrid\r\nand familiar tap on the shoulder.\r\n\r\nThe two bailiffs who dogged have seized their prey.\r\n\r\n\"At whose suit?\" asked John Burley, falteringly.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Cox, the wine-merchant.\"\r\n\r\n\"Cox! A man to whom I gave a cheque on my bankers not three months ago!\"\r\n\r\n\"But it war'nt cashed.\"\r\n\r\n\"What does that signify?--the intention was the same. A good heart takes\r\nthe will for the deed. Cox is a monster of ingratitude; and I withdraw my\r\ncustom.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sarve him right. Would your honor like a jarvey?\"\r\n\r\n\"I would rather spend the money on something else,\" said John Burley. \"Give\r\nme your arm, I am not proud. After all, thank heaven, I shall not sleep in\r\nthe country.\"\r\n\r\nAnd John Burley made a night of it in the Fleet.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nMiss Starke was one of those ladies who pass their lives in the direst of\r\nall civil strife--war with their servants. She looked upon the members of\r\nthat class as the unrelenting and sleepless enemies of the unfortunate\r\nhouseholders condemned to employ them. She thought they ate and drank to\r\ntheir villanous utmost, in order to ruin their benefactors--that they lived\r\nin one constant conspiracy with one another and the tradesmen, the object\r\nof which was to cheat and pilfer. Miss Starke was a miserable woman. As she\r\nhad no relations or friends who cared enough for her to share her solitary\r\nstruggle against her domestic foes; and her income, though easy, was an\r\nannuity that died with herself, thereby reducing various nephews, nieces,\r\nor cousins, to the strict bounds of a natural affection--that did not\r\nexist; and as she felt the want of some friendly face amidst this world of\r\ndistrust and hate, so she had tried the resource of venal companions. But\r\nthe venal companions had never staid long--either they disliked Miss\r\nStarke, or Miss Starke disliked them. Therefore the poor woman had resolved\r\nupon bringing up some little girl whose heart, as she said to herself;\r\nwould be fresh and uncorrupted, and from whom she might expect gratitude.\r\nShe had been contented, on the whole, with Helen, and had meant to keep\r\nthat child in her house as long as she (Miss Starke) remained upon the\r\nearth--perhaps some thirty years longer; and then, having carefully\r\nsecluded her from marriage, and other friendship, to leave her nothing but\r\nthe regret of having lost so kind a benefactress. Agreeably with this\r\nnotion, and in order to secure the affections of the child, Miss Starke had\r\nrelaxed the frigid austerity natural to her manner and mode of thought, and\r\nbeen kind to Helen in an iron way. She had neither slapped nor pinched her,\r\nneither had she starved. She had allowed her to see Leonard, according to\r\nthe agreement made with Dr. Morgan, and had laid out tenpence on cakes,\r\nbesides contributing fruit from her garden for the first interview--a\r\nhospitality she did not think it fit to renew on subsequent occasions. In\r\nreturn for this, she conceived she had purchased the right to Helen bodily\r\nand spiritually, and nothing could exceed her indignation when she rose one\r\nmorning and found the child had gone. As it never had occurred to her to\r\nask Leonard's address, though she suspected Helen had gone to him, she was\r\nat a loss what to do, and remained for twenty-four hours in a state of\r\ninane depression. But then she began to miss the child so much that her\r\nenergies woke, and she persuaded herself that she was actuated by the\r\npurest benevolence in trying to reclaim this poor creature from the world,\r\ninto which Helen had thus rashly plunged.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, she put an advertisement into the _Times_, to the following\r\neffect, liberally imitated from one by which, in former years, she had\r\nrecovered a favorite Blenheim:\r\n\r\n     TWO GUINEAS REWARD.\r\n\r\n     Strayed, from Ivy Cottage, Highgate, a Little Girl, answers\r\n     to the name of Helen; with blue eyes and brown hair; white\r\n     muslin frock, and straw hat with blue ribbons. Whoever will\r\n     bring the same to Ivy Cottage, shall receive the above\r\n     Reward.\r\n\r\n     _N. B._--Nothing more will be offered.\r\n\r\nNow, it so happened that Mrs. Smedley had put an advertisement in the\r\n_Times_ on her own account, relative to a niece of hers who was coming from\r\nthe country, and for whom she desired to find a situation. So, contrary to\r\nher usual habit, she sent for the newspaper, and, close by her own\r\nadvertisement she saw Miss Starke's.\r\n\r\nIt was impossible that she could mistake the description of Helen; and, as\r\nthis advertisement caught her eye the very day after the whole house had\r\nbeen disturbed and scandalized by Burley's noisy visit, and on which she\r\nhad resolved to get rid of a lodger who received such visitors, the\r\ngood-hearted woman was delighted to think that she could restore Helen to\r\nsome safe home. While thus thinking, Helen herself entered the kitchen\r\nwhere Mrs. Smedley sat, and the landlady had the imprudence to point out\r\nthe advertisement, and talk, as she called it, \"seriously\" to the little\r\ngirl.\r\n\r\nHelen in vain and with tears entreated her to take no step in reply to the\r\nadvertisement. Mrs. Smedley felt it was an affair of duty, and was\r\nobdurate, and shortly afterwards put on her bonnet and left the house.\r\nHelen conjectured that she was on her way to Miss Starke's, and her whole\r\nsoul was bent on flight. Leonard had gone to the office of the _Beehive_\r\nwith his MSS.; but she packed up all their joint effects, and, just as she\r\nhad done so, he returned. She communicated the news of the advertisement,\r\nand said she should be so miserable if compelled to go back to Miss\r\nStarke's, and implored him so pathetically to save her from such sorrow\r\nthat he at once assented to her proposal of flight. Luckily, little was\r\nowing to the landlady--that little was left with the maid-servant; and,\r\nprofiting by Mrs. Smedley's absence, they escaped without scene or\r\nconflict. Their effects were taken by Leonard to a stand of hackney\r\nvehicles, and then left at a coach-office, while they went in search of\r\nlodgings. It was wise to choose an entirely new and remote district; and\r\nbefore night they were settled in an attic in Lambeth.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nAs the reader will expect, no trace of Burley could Leonard find; the\r\nhumorist had ceased to communicate with the _Beehive_. But Leonard grieved\r\nfor Burley's sake; and, indeed, he missed the intercourse of the large\r\nwrong mind. But he settled down by degrees to the simple loving society of\r\nhis child companion, and in that presence grew more tranquil. The hours in\r\nthe daytime that he did not pass at work he spent as before, picking up\r\nknowledge at book-stalls; and at dusk he and Helen would stroll\r\nout--sometimes striving to escape from the long suburb into fresh rural\r\nair; more often wandering to and fro the bridge that led to glorious\r\nWestminster--London's classic land--and watching the vague lamps reflected\r\non the river. This haunt suited the musing melancholy boy. He would stand\r\nlong and with wistful silence by the balustrade--seating Helen thereon,\r\nthat she too might look along the dark mournful waters which, dark though\r\nthey be, still have their charm of mysterious repose.\r\n\r\nAs the river flowed between the world of roofs and the roar of human\r\npassions on either side, so in those two hearts flowed Thought--and all\r\nthey knew of London was its shadow.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nThere appeared in the _Beehive_ certain very truculent political\r\npapers--papers very like the tracts in the Tinker's bag. Leonard did not\r\nheed them much, but they made far more sensation in the public that read\r\nthe _Beehive_ than Leonard's papers, full of rare promise though the last\r\nwere. They greatly increased the sale of the periodical in the\r\nmanufacturing towns, and began to awake the drowsy vigilance of the Home\r\nOffice. Suddenly a descent was made upon the _Beehive_, and all its papers\r\nand plans. The editor saw himself threatened with a criminal prosecution,\r\nand the certainty of two years' imprisonment: he did not like the prospect,\r\nand disappeared. One evening, when Leonard, unconscious of these\r\nmischances, arrived at the door of the office, he found it closed. An\r\nagitated mob was before it, and a voice that was not new to his ear, was\r\nharanguing the bystanders, with many imprecations against \"tyrans.\" He\r\nlooked, and, to his amaze, recognized in the orator Mr. Sprott the Tinker.\r\n\r\nThe police came in numbers to disperse the crowd, and Mr. Sprott prudently\r\nvanished, Leonard learned then what had befallen, and again saw himself\r\nwithout employment and the means of bread.\r\n\r\nSlowly he walked back. \"O, knowledge, knowledge!--powerless indeed!\" he\r\nmurmured.\r\n\r\nAs he thus spoke, a handbill in large capitals met his eyes on a dead\r\nwall--\"Wanted, a few smart young men for India.\"\r\n\r\nA crimp accosted him--\"You would make a fine soldier, my man. You have\r\nstout limbs of your own.\" Leonard moved on.\r\n\r\n\"It has come back, then, to this. Brute physical force after all. O Mind,\r\ndespair! O Peasant, be a machine again.\"\r\n\r\nHe entered his attic noiselessly, and gazed upon Helen as she sat at her\r\nwork, straining her eyes by the open window--with tender and deep\r\ncompassion. She had not heard him enter, nor was she aware of his presence.\r\nPatient and still she sat, and the small fingers plied busily. He gazed,\r\nand saw that her cheek was pale and hollow, and the hands looked so thin!\r\nHis heart was deeply touched, and at that moment he had not one memory of\r\nthe baffled Poet, one thought that proclaimed the Egotist.\r\n\r\nHe approached her gently, laid his hand on her shoulder--\"Helen, put on\r\nyour shawl and bonnet, and walk out--I have much to say.\"\r\n\r\nIn a few moments she was ready, and they took their way to their favorite\r\nhaunt upon the bridge. Pausing in one of the recesses or nooks, Leonard\r\nthen began,--\"Helen, we must part.\"\r\n\r\n\"Part?--Oh, brother!\"\r\n\r\n\"Listen. All work that depends on mind is over for me; nothing remains but\r\nthe labor of thews and sinews. I cannot go back to my village and say to\r\nall, 'My hopes were self-conceit and my intellect a delusion!' I cannot.\r\nNeither in this sordid city can I turn menial or porter. I might be born to\r\nthat drudgery, but, my mind has, it may be unhappily, raised me above my\r\nbirth. What, then, shall I do? I know not yet--serve as a soldier, or push\r\nmy way to some wilderness afar, as an emigrant, perhaps. But whatever my\r\nchoice, I must henceforth be alone; I have a home no more. But there is a\r\nhome for you, Helen, a very humble one, (for you, too, so well born,) but\r\nvery safe--the roof of--of--my peasant mother. She will love you for my\r\nsake, and--and----\"\r\n\r\nHelen clung to him trembling, and sobbed out. \"Any thing, any thing you\r\nwill. But I can work; I can make money, Leonard. I do, indeed, make\r\nmoney--you do not know how much--but enough for us both till better times\r\ncome to you. Do not let us part.\r\n\r\n\"And I--a man, and born to labor, to be maintained by the work of an\r\ninfant! No, Helen, do not so degrade me.\"\r\n\r\nShe drew back as she looked on his flushed brow, bowed her head\r\nsubmissively, and murmured, \"Pardon.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah,\" said Helen, after a pause; \"if now we could but find my poor father's\r\nfriend! I never so much cared for it before.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, he would surely provide for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"For _me_!\" repeated Helen, in a tone of soft deep reproach, and she turned\r\naway her head to conceal her tears.\r\n\r\n\"You are sure you would remember him, if we met him by chance?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes. He was so different from all we see in this terrible city, and\r\nhis eyes were like yonder stars, so clear and so bright; yet the light\r\nseemed to come from afar off, as the light does in yours, when your\r\nthoughts are away from all things round you. And then, too, his dog whom he\r\ncalled Nero--I could not forget that.\"\r\n\r\n\"But his dog may not be always with him.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the bright clear eyes are! Ah, now you look up to heaven, and yours\r\nseems to dream like his.\"\r\n\r\nLeonard did not answer, for his thoughts were indeed less on earth than\r\nstruggling to pierce into that remote and mysterious heaven.\r\n\r\nBoth were silent long; the crowd passed them by unheedingly. Night deepened\r\nover the river, but the reflection of the lamplights on its waves was more\r\nvisible than that of the stars. The beams showed the darkness of the strong\r\ncurrent, and the craft that lay eastward on the tide, with sail-less\r\nspectral masts and black dismal hulks, looked deathlike in their stillness.\r\n\r\nLeonard looked down, and the thought of Chatterton's grim suicide came back\r\nto his soul, and a pale, scornful face with luminous haunting eyes seemed\r\nto look up from the stream, and murmur from livid lips,--\"Struggle no more\r\nagainst the tides on the surface--all is calm and rest within the deep.\"\r\n\r\nStarting in terror from the gloom of his reverie, the boy began to talk\r\nfast to Helen, and tried to soothe her with descriptions of the lowly home\r\nwhich he had offered.\r\n\r\nHe spoke of the light cares which she would participate with his\r\nmother--for by that name he still called the widow--and dwelt, with an\r\neloquence that the contrast round him made sincere and strong, on the happy\r\nrural life, the shadowy woodlands, the rippling cornfields, the solemn lone\r\nchurchspire soaring from the tranquil landscape. Flatteringly he painted\r\nthe flowery terraces of the Italian exile, and the playful fountain that,\r\neven as he spoke, was flinging up its spray to the stars, through serene\r\nair untroubled by the smoke of cities, and untainted by the sinful sighs of\r\nmen. He promised her the love and protection of natures akin to the happy\r\nscene: the simple affectionate mother--the gentle pastor--the exile, wise\r\nand kind--Violante, with dark eyes full of the mystic thoughts that\r\nsolitude calls from childhood,--Violante should be her companion.\r\n\r\n\"And oh!\" cried Helen, \"if life be thus happy there, return with me,\r\nreturn--return!\"\r\n\r\n\"Alas!\" murmured the boy, \"if the hammer once strike the spark from the\r\nanvil, the spark must fly upward; it cannot fall back to earth until light\r\nhas left it. Upward still, Helen--let me go upward still!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nThe next morning Helen was very ill--so ill that, shortly after rising, she\r\nwas forced to creep back to bed. Her frame shivered--her eyes were\r\nheavy--her hand burned like fire. Fever had set in. Perhaps she might have\r\ncaught cold on the bridge--perhaps her emotions had proved too much for her\r\nframe. Leonard, in great alarm, called on the nearest apothecary. The\r\napothecary looked grave, and said there was danger. And danger soon\r\ndeclared itself--Helen became delirious. For several days she lay in this\r\nstate, between life and death. Leonard then felt that all the sorrows of\r\nearth are light, compared with the fear of losing what we love. How\r\nvalueless the envied laurel seemed beside the dying rose.\r\n\r\nThanks, perhaps, more to his heed and tending than to medical skill, she\r\nrecovered sense at last--immediate peril was over. But she was very weak\r\nand reduced--her ultimate recovery doubtful--convalescence, at best, likely\r\nto be very slow.\r\n\r\nBut when she learned how long she had been thus ill, she looked anxiously\r\nat Leonard's face as he bent over her, and faltered forth--\"Give me my\r\nwork! I am strong enough for that now--it would amuse me.\"\r\n\r\nLeonard burst into tears.\r\n\r\nAlas! he had no work himself; all their joint money had melted away; the\r\napothecary was not like good Dr. Morgan; the medicines were to be paid for,\r\nand the rent. Two days before, Leonard had pawned Riccabocca's watch; and\r\nwhen the last shilling thus raised was gone, how should he support Helen?\r\nNevertheless he conquered his tears, and assured her that he had\r\nemployment; and that so earnestly that she believed him, and sank into soft\r\nsleep. He listened to her breathing, kissed her forehead, and left the\r\nroom. He turned into his own neighboring garret, and, leaning his face on\r\nhis hands, collected all his thoughts.\r\n\r\nHe must be a beggar at last. He must write to Mr. Dale for money--Mr. Dale,\r\ntoo, who knew the secret of his birth. He would rather have begged of a\r\nstranger--it served to add a new dishonor to his mother's memory for the\r\nchild to beg of one who was acquainted with her shame. Had he himself been\r\nthe only one to want and to starve, he would have sunk inch by inch into\r\nthe grave of famine, before he would have so subdued his pride. But Helen,\r\nthere on that bed--Helen needing, for weeks perhaps, all support, and\r\nillness making luxuries themselves like necessaries! Beg he must. And when\r\nhe so resolved, had you but seen the proud bitter soul he conquered, you\r\nwould have said--\"This which he thinks is degradation--this is heroism. Oh,\r\nstrange human heart!--no epic ever written achieves the Sublime and the\r\nBeautiful which are graven, unread by human eye, in thy secret leaves,\" Of\r\nwhom else should he beg? His mother had nothing, Riccabocca was poor, and\r\nthe stately Violante, who had exclaimed, \"Would that I were a man!\"--he\r\ncould not endure the thought that she should pity him, and despise. The\r\nAvenels! No--thrice No. He drew towards him hastily ink and paper, and\r\nwrote rapid lines that were wrung from him as from the bleeding strings of\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nBut the hour for the post had passed--the letter must wait till the next\r\nday; and three days at least would elapse before he could receive an\r\nanswer. He left the letter on the table, and, stifling as for air, went\r\nforth. He crossed the bridge--he passed on mechanically--and was borne\r\nalong by a crowd pressing towards the doors of Parliament. A debate that\r\nexcited popular interest was fixed for that evening, and many bystanders\r\ncollected in the street to see the members pass to and fro, or hear what\r\nspeakers had yet risen to take part in the debate, or try to get orders for\r\nthe gallery.\r\n\r\nHe halted amidst these loiterers, with no interest, indeed, in common with\r\nthem, but looking over their heads abstractedly towards the tall Funeral\r\nAbbey--Imperial Golgotha of Poets, and Chiefs, and Kings.\r\n\r\nSuddenly his attention was diverted to those around by the sound of a\r\nname--displeasingly known to him. \"How are you, Randal Leslie? Coming to\r\nhear the debate?\" said a member who was passing through the street.\r\n\r\n\"Yes; Mr. Egerton promised to get me under the gallery. He is to speak\r\nhimself to-night, and I have never heard him. As you are going into the\r\nHouse, will you remind him?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't now, for he is speaking already, and well too. I hurried from the\r\nAthenaeum, where I was dining, on purpose to be in time, as I heard that his\r\nspeech was making a great effect.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is very unlucky,\" said Randal, \"I had no idea he would speak so\r\nearly.\"\r\n\r\n\"M---- brought him up by a direct personal attack. But follow me; perhaps I\r\ncan get you into the House; and a man like you, Leslie, of whom we expect\r\ngreat things some day, I can tell you, should not miss any such opportunity\r\nof knowing what this House of ours is on a field night. Come on!\"\r\n\r\nThe member hurried towards the door; and as Randal followed him, a\r\nbystander cried--\"That's the young man who wrote the famous\r\npamphlet--Egerton's relation.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, indeed!\" said another. \"Clever man, Egerton--I am waiting for him.\"\r\n\r\n\"So am I.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, you are not a constituent, as I am.\"\r\n\r\n\"No; but he has been very kind to my nephew, and I must thank him. You are\r\na constituent--he is an honor to your town.\"\r\n\r\n\"So he is; enlightened man!\"\r\n\r\n\"And so generous!\"\r\n\r\n\"Brings forward really good measures,\" quoth the politician.\r\n\r\n\"And clever young men,\" said the uncle.\r\n\r\nTherewith one or two others joined in the praise of Audley Egerton, and\r\nmany anecdotes of his liberality were told.\r\n\r\nLeonard listened at first listlessly, at last with thoughtful attention. He\r\nhad heard Burley, too, speak highly of this generous statesman, who,\r\nwithout pretending to genius himself, appreciated it in others. He suddenly\r\nremembered, too, that Egerton was half-brother to the Squire. Vague notions\r\nof some appeal to this eminent person, not for charity, but employ to his\r\nmind, gleamed across him--inexperienced boy that he yet was! And while thus\r\nmeditating, the door of the House opened, and out came Audley Egerton\r\nhimself. A partial cheering, followed by a general murmur, apprised Leonard\r\nof the presence of the popular statesman. Egerton was caught hold of by\r\nsome five or six persons in succession; a shake of the hand, a nod, a brief\r\nwhispered word or two, sufficed the practised member for graceful escape;\r\nand soon, free from the crowd, his tall erect figure passed on, and turned\r\ntowards the bridge. He paused at the angle and took out his watch, looking\r\nat it by the lamp-light.\r\n\r\n\"Harley will be here soon,\" he muttered--\"he is always punctual; and now\r\nthat I have spoken, I can give him an hour or so. That is well.\"\r\n\r\nAs he replaced his watch in his pocket, and re-buttoned his coat over his\r\nfirm broad chest, he lifted his eyes, and saw a young man standing before\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"Do you want me?\" asked the statesman, with the direct brevity of his\r\npractical character.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Egerton,\" said the young man, with a voice that slightly trembled, and\r\nyet was manly amidst emotion, \"you have a great name, and great power--I\r\nstand here in these streets of London without a friend, and without employ.\r\nI believe that I have it in me to do some nobler work than that of bodily\r\nlabor, had I but one friend--one opening for my thoughts. And now I have\r\nsaid this, I scarcely know how, or why, but from despair, and the sudden\r\nimpulse which that despair took from the praise that follows your success,\r\nI have nothing more to add.\"\r\n\r\nAudley Egerton was silent for a moment, struck by the tone and address of\r\nthe stranger; but the consummate and wary man of the world, accustomed to\r\nall manner of strange applications, and all varieties of imposture, quickly\r\nrecovered from a passing and slight effect.\r\n\r\n\"Are you a native of ----?\" (naming the town he represented as member.)\r\n\r\n\"No, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, young man, I am very sorry for you; but the good sense you must\r\npossess (for I judge of that by the education you have evidently received)\r\nmust tell you that a public man, whatever be his patronage, has it too\r\nfully absorbed by claimants who have a right to demand it, to be able to\r\nlisten to strangers.\"\r\n\r\nHe paused a moment, and, as Leonard stood silent, added, with more kindness\r\nthan most public men so accosted would have showed--\"You say you are\r\nfriendless--poor fellow. In early life that happens to many of us, who find\r\nfriends enough before the close. Be honest, and well-conducted; lean on\r\nyourself, not on strangers; work with the body if you can't with the mind;\r\nand, believe me, that advice is all I can give you, unless this\r\ntrifle,\"--and the minister held out a crown piece.\r\n\r\nLeonard bowed, shook his head sadly, and walked away. Egerton looked after\r\nhim with a slight pang.\r\n\r\n\"Pooh!\" said he to himself, \"there must be thousands in the same state in\r\nthese streets of London. I cannot redress the necessities of civilization.\r\nWell educated! It is not from ignorance henceforth that society will\r\nsuffer--it is from over-educating the hungry thousands who, thus unfitted\r\nfor manual toil, and with no career for mental, will some day or other\r\nstand like that boy in our streets, and puzzle wiser ministers than I am.\"\r\n\r\nAs Egerton thus mused, and passed on to the bridge, a bugle-horn rang\r\nmerrily from the box of a gay four-in-hand. A drag-coach with superb\r\nblood-horses rattled over the causeway, and in the driver Egerton\r\nrecognised his nephew--Frank Hazeldean.\r\n\r\nThe young Guardsman was returning, with a lively party of men, from dining\r\nat Greenwich; and the careless laughter of these children of pleasure\r\nfloated far over the still river.\r\n\r\nIt vexed the ear of the careworn statesman--sad, perhaps, with all his\r\ngreatness, lonely amidst all his crowd of friends. It reminded him,\r\nperhaps, of his own youth, when such parties and companionships were\r\nfamiliar to him, though through them all he bore an ambitious aspiring\r\nsoul--\"_Le jeu vaut-il la chandelle?_\" said he, shrugging his shoulders.\r\n\r\nThe coach rolled rapidly past Leonard, as he stood leaning against the\r\ncorner of the bridge, and the mire of the kennel splashed over him from the\r\nhoofs of the fiery horses. The laughter smote on his ear more discordantly\r\nthan on the minister's, but it begot no envy.\r\n\r\n\"Life is a dark riddle,\" said he, smiting his breast.\r\n\r\nAnd he walked slowly on, gained the recess where he had stood several\r\nnights before with Helen; and dizzy with want of food, and worn out for\r\nwant of sleep, he sank down into the dark corner; while the river that\r\nrolled under the arch of stone muttered dirge-like in his ear;--as under\r\nthe social key-stone wails and rolls on for ever the mystery of Human\r\nDiscontent. Take comfort, O Thinker by the stream! 'Tis the river that\r\nfounded and gave pomp to the city; and without the discontent, where were\r\nprogress--what were Man? Take comfort, O Thinker! wherever the stream over\r\nwhich thou bendest, or beside which thou sinkest, weary and desolate, frets\r\nthe arch that supports thee;--never dream that, by destroying the bridge,\r\nthou canst silence the moan of the wave!\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[18] Continued from page 259.\r\n\r\n[19] Fact. In a work by M. GIBERT, a celebrated French physician, on\r\ndiseases of the skin, he states that that minute troublesome kind of rash,\r\nknown by the name of _prurigo_, though not dangerous in itself, has often\r\ndriven the individual afflicted by it to--suicide. I believe that our more\r\nvarying climate, and our more heating drinks and ailments, render the skin\r\ncomplaint more common in England than in France, yet I doubt if any English\r\nphysician could state that it had ever driven one of his _English_ patients\r\nto suicide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the London Art-Journal.\r\n\r\nINTERNATIONAL COPYRIGHT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe recent judgment of Lord Campbell in Boosey _v._ Jeffreys, which has\r\nsettled finally the much litigated question of the right of a foreigner to\r\ncopyright in this country, whether of books, pictures, or music, has been\r\nalleged as an excuse for a public meeting of authors and publishers, to\r\nappeal against the concession of such a right, and to procure a reversal of\r\nthe decision, should his lordship be disposed to overrule his own judgment\r\nin the House of Lords. The direct impulse to the present agitation,\r\nhowever, appears to have been certain proceedings commenced against Mr.\r\nBohn and others, by Mr. Murray, for their alleged invasion of his\r\ncopyrights in the works of Washington Irving; of which cheap editions have\r\nbeen issued, on the faith of a recent opinion of Lord Cranworth, wholly at\r\nvariance with that which has lately been pronounced by the Court of Error,\r\nby no fewer than four publishers. The defendants in these cases are of\r\ncourse the leading instigators of this movement, and appear to have\r\nprevailed upon Sir Edward Bulwer Lytton to take the chair at a public\r\nmeeting of Authors and Publishers, at the Hanover Square Rooms, for the\r\npurpose of discussing the question in all its bearings. Although the\r\nauthors and publishers of England were but slenderly represented on the\r\noccasion, and even those who were present were far from unanimous, several\r\ningenious and even brilliant speeches were delivered, and resolutions were\r\ncarried, tending to support the Chairman's view of the subject; viz., to\r\nprocure a revision of the law which declares foreign authors resident\r\nabroad, to be entitled to copyright in this country; to form a society to\r\nconsider the steps necessary to obtain the proposed readjustment of the\r\nlaw; and lastly, to collect subscriptions to indemnify the gentlemen now\r\nacting on the defensive, in the various actions for the alleged invasion of\r\ncopyright, in the expensive process of appealing against Lord Campbell's\r\ndecision to the House of Lords. We confess that we have not been convinced\r\nby any of the arguments adduced on this occasion, able and plausible as\r\nmany of them were, that we should violate that great principle of justice,\r\nwhich forbids that we should do evil that good may come; and that because\r\nforeign nations cannot be brought to a sense of the dishonesty of their\r\nhabitual invasions of British Copyright, we should make reprisals upon\r\ntheir authors, and deny them that protection which they so dishonestly\r\nwithhold to us. Still less can we affirm a proposition which would go back\r\nfrom twenty five to thirty years, and deprive English booksellers of\r\ncopyrights for which, on the faith of the law as it then stood, they have\r\npaid very considerable sums of money. The impression, that if we deprive\r\nAmerican authors of the copyright they have hitherto enjoyed in England, we\r\nshall force them and their readers to agree to an international\r\narrangement, we believe to be entirely fallacious. There are very few\r\nAmerican authors whose copyrights have proved of any material value to\r\nEnglish publishers; and even of that few, the majority have retired for\r\nsome years past, almost wholly from the field of literature. Washington\r\nIrving, Cooper, and Prescott, are almost the only authors who have a\r\nmarketable value in this country; and two out of the three have written\r\nlittle that is worthy of their genius for many years. Besides, the American\r\nbuccaneer knows full well that the chief weight of the sacrifice, if\r\nAmerican copyrights were to be declared null and void in this country,\r\nwould fall upon neither Mr. Irving, Mr. Cooper, nor Mr. Prescott, but upon\r\nMessrs. Murray and Bentley, the British possessors of their copyrights. If,\r\ntherefore, the question be mooted at all, it should not be with a view to a\r\nretrospective operation. But we more than doubt, if America, uninfluenced\r\nby worthier motives, will ever be driven to a recognition of the rights of\r\nBritish authors, for the sake of protecting the interests of the very few\r\nof its native writers who look to England for the chief reward of their\r\nliterary labor. America, in her rage for cheap editions, has almost\r\nannihilated her own literature, and her unwarrantable piracy of our best\r\nauthors, does but react on those of her own. If unable to understand the\r\nimpolicy of her present course, will mulcting Mr. Murray and Mr. Bentley\r\ninduce her to abandon her wholesale appropriations of English literary\r\nproperty? or, will our becoming robbers ourselves diminish the wholesale\r\npiracy of our neighbors? We think not. The arguments of Sir Edward Bulwer\r\nLytton, which apply to the conduct of America in refusing to entertain the\r\nquestion of international copyright, are unanswerable; but if she prefers\r\nthe selfish demands of the million to the interests of her own writers, she\r\nis not likely to be deterred from continuing the work of spoliation because\r\nwe, at length, determine to follow her example. It cannot be doubted, for\r\none moment, that it was the _intention_ of the act at present in force, to\r\nrecognize the copyright of foreigners whose works were first published in\r\nthis country, and it is equally clear that the law for the protection of\r\nthe patents of foreigners in England, was conceived in the same spirit. Why\r\nshould we refuse protection to the writings of a foreign author, and\r\nconcede it to his scientific discoveries? If we are to interpret the law as\r\nSir E. Bulwer Lytton and Mr. Bohn would have us do, why should we grant to\r\nany foreign inventor the patent by which his property is secured in this\r\ncountry? More than twenty years ago the late Mr. Murray paid Washington\r\nIrving 1500_l._ for his Tales of a Traveller; 3000_l._ for his Columbus;\r\n1000_l._, for his Granada; and 1000_l._ for his Bracebridge Hall. Is it to\r\nbe endured, that because American booksellers are engaged in an\r\nunauthorized republication of every English book which they consider worth\r\nreprinting, we should, after so long a forbearance, become pirates in our\r\nturn; and thus despoil, not the foreign aggressor, but our own respectable\r\npublishers, of a right in which so large an amount of capital and\r\nenterprise has been embarked.\r\n\r\nWhatever difference of opinion, therefore, there may be as to the measures\r\nwhich are most likely to force upon our neighbors a fair recognition of the\r\nrights of our authors, by a system of reprisal which we could never be\r\nbrought to admire, and which we consider beneath the dignity of our\r\nnational character, there can be none as to the absurdity of attempting so\r\nto do, by a retrospective operation which has neither justice nor common\r\nhonesty to recommend it. We are far from desiring to attach any moral blame\r\nto the gentlemen whose reprints, in this country, of the works of Irving\r\nand others, have given occasion for the present controversy. The state of\r\nthe law, as interpreted by Lord Cranworth, and other of our eminent\r\njurists, appears to have warranted their belief that they were perfectly\r\nauthorized in so doing. There are, however, considerations of courtesy\r\nwhich ought always to be observed by persons of the same profession towards\r\neach other, which should prevent them from doing all that even the law\r\nentitles them to do, where, by such a course, they are prejudicing the\r\ninterests of their respectable brother tradesmen, on occasions on which\r\nthey had good ground to believe that they have done every thing they could\r\nto secure the rights to which they lay claim. Neither is the position of\r\nthe author to be wholly overlooked. So far back as 1813 or 1814, Washington\r\nIrving was a resident in this country, engaged in mercantile pursuits, as a\r\npartner in a British firm, and was as much an Englishman as either Mr.\r\nLeslie or Mr. Stuart Newton. He was, indeed, a resident in England at the\r\ndate of the publication of several of his works. But the principle, if\r\ncarried out fairly, would compromise the interests of painters and\r\nprint-publishers, as well as of litterateurs and booksellers. If the\r\narguments employed at the late meeting, are at all tenable, the valuable\r\ncopyrights of Messrs. Moon, Graves & Co., Colnaghi, or Hogarth, and other\r\nprintsellers, in the engravings executed from the works of Leslie, Newton,\r\nOhalon, and others, are completely at the mercy of any one who may think it\r\nworth his while to reproduce them. The sort of retaliation, therefore,\r\nwhich is now suggested, would be equivalent to that of cutting off the nose\r\nfor the purpose of being revenged upon the face.\r\n\r\nIt is quite true that in 1845, in Chappell _v._ Purday, the Court of\r\nExchequer was of opinion that a foreign author residing abroad, who\r\ncomposed a work there, could have no copyright in this country; a decision\r\nwhich was subsequently confirmed in the same Court in Boosey v. Purday.\r\nThese judgments have, however, been entirely overruled by Lord Campbell,\r\nwho on a late occasion pronounced an opinion in the teeth of these\r\ndecisions, and whose impressions on this question are said to be shared by\r\na large majority of the Judges of the Court of Queen's Bench. The point may\r\ntherefore be considered as settled; and as further litigation in the Court\r\nof Chancery can only be productive of ruinous expense and vexation, it is\r\nmuch to be desired that an amicable arrangement of the differences of the\r\nrespective publishers may be entered into, which, whilst it recognizes the\r\nproper principle, will avert the necessity of further contests on the\r\nsubject. Mr. Colburn was, it appears, in favor of the anti-foreign\r\ncopyright disputants, and has, therefore, clearly invited the invasion of\r\nhis own copyrights of the works of American authors. As, however, he is\r\nunderstood to have virtually, if not ostensibly, retired from the\r\npublishing trade, he has for the future, at least, but little interest in\r\nthe matter.\r\n\r\nThe speeches of Sir Edward Bulwer Lytton and of Mr. Bohn, at the late\r\nmeeting, contain many facts and illustrations, which will be found of\r\nservice in considering the question of international copyright. Mr. Bohn\r\nhas already done much by the publication of cheap editions of standard\r\nauthors, at a very moderate price, to render good books accessible to the\r\npublic, and is placed by his position as a bookseller, beyond the suspicion\r\nof having been actuated by mercenary or unworthy motives in the matter. We\r\nquestion however if the general interests of authors and publishers have\r\nnot suffered materially from his reprints. When Mr. Colburn attributed to\r\nAmerican piracy the discouraging fact that for books for which he could\r\nonce afford to pay 1000_l._, he cannot now give more than from 100_l._ to\r\n150_l._, he appears to have overlooked the prevalence of cheap literature\r\ngenerally in this country; and the ruinous competition which is now going\r\non among rival booksellers. Who is likely to purchase his guinea and a half\r\neditions of Cooper's novels, when he can obtain from Mr. Bohn the works of\r\nWashington Irving (large and handsomely printed volumes) at two shillings\r\neach? Besides, the same system of piracy was at work when he purchased Mr.\r\nCooper's copyrights, as is in operation now. He recommends British\r\npublishers not to purchase another copyright from an American author until\r\nhis government have consented to enter into some international arrangement;\r\nand so far we agree with him in his suggestion. It is a remarkable fact,\r\nhowever, that whilst British authors are protesting in their speeches and\r\nwritings against foreign appropriations of their copyrights, they are often\r\nvery much flattered by their adoption. The audacious single-volume piracies\r\nof Galignani and Baudry of Paris, of the poetry of Byron, Scott, Southey,\r\nMoore, Coleridge, Shelley and others, were often looked upon by the parties\r\nwho might be expected to consider themselves most aggrieved, as conferring\r\na distinction upon their writings calculated to increase their reputation\r\nin this country. In several instances within our knowledge, the materials\r\nfor the biographical notices which prefaced the respective volumes were\r\nsupplied by the authors themselves! Lord Byron, so far from expressing any\r\nindignation at the liberty which Messrs. Galignani had taken with his\r\nwritings, assisted them in identifying them, and wrote interesting\r\nautograph letters to aid in their illustration.\r\n\r\nSouthey, as we gather from one of his letters, was rather flattered than\r\notherwise at the republication of his poetry in Paris, and if rumor may be\r\ncredited, Moore corrected the proofs, and furnished materials for the\r\nbiography of one or more of the foreign editions of his works. Mr. Bowles\r\nand several other poets whose writings were included in this series, not\r\nonly furnished notes for the Biographical Prefaces, but indicated to the\r\neditor the publications from which their fugitive writings should be\r\ncollected. Mrs. Hemans furnished several notes and suggestions for one of\r\nthe American editions of her works, and sent copies to her friends as\r\nevidence of her translantic popularity. In fact we have rarely met with an\r\nauthor whose writings have been deemed worthy of being reprinted abroad,\r\nwho has not considered himself flattered by the preference. We do not of\r\ncourse profess to believe that their publishers were equally complimented\r\nby this unceremonious invasion of their property. So long as the sale of\r\nsuch piracies were limited to the continent, we doubt if they were the\r\nmeans of abstracting a great deal from the pockets of either the author or\r\npublisher; but for very many years they were allowed to be imported in\r\nsingle copies, during which period they were introduced into this country\r\nin large quantities. They were, however, purchased rather from their\r\ncompactness than for their cheapness, and the instant Mr. Murray published\r\na handsomely printed single volume edition of the Poetry of Lord Byron at a\r\nmoderate price, the trade in French and Belgian piracies of British\r\ncopyrights was almost destroyed. Why should we not print cheap editions for\r\nexportation? The drawback on the paper, and the superiority of our printing\r\nand binding would be sufficiently obvious to enable us to obtain a better\r\nprice than would be given for such coarse reprints as are usually hurried\r\ninto circulation in America. We cannot but believe that such an enterprise\r\nmight be carried out successfully. There is scarcely an edition, at a\r\nmoderate price, of any American author, that is worthy of the library; and\r\nlooking at the quality of the paper and print, we doubt if the American\r\nbooksellers could afford a volume of similar quality at the price charged\r\nby Mr. Bohn for his reprints.\r\n\r\nAny plan is, however, better than that suggested at the late meeting, of\r\nbecoming pirates ourselves to cure our neighbors of their buccaneering\r\npropensities. The comparatively small number of works of mark which are now\r\nproduced in America (there have been no prose writers of any very great\r\neminence since the heyday of the literary lives of Irving, Cooper, and\r\nChanning, if we except Mr. Prescott) goes far to show that national\r\nliterature is all but annihilated in that country, and that the evil must\r\neventually, in a great measure, correct itself. In a recent American\r\nnewspaper it is stated that protection is not refused in that country to\r\nany British author who will go through the necessary forms by which he\r\nbecomes qualified for the privilege. Our readers will smile to hear that\r\none of these conditions consists of an oath, by which the candidate for\r\ncopyright in America is required to \"renounce for ever all allegiance and\r\nfidelity to any foreign prince, potentate, state or sovereign, whatever,\r\nand particularly _to the Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and\r\nIreland!\"_ The late Captain Marryat declined to comply with these terms,\r\nalthough another English author, of undeniable reputation, has, it is\r\naffirmed, not scrupled to bolt this denationalizing pill. We have not heard\r\nif he has turned his privilege to any account.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Fraser's Magazine.\r\n\r\nA COUNTRY GENTLEMAN AT HOME.\r\n\r\nBY C. ASTOR BRISTED.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a lovely October day; the temperature perfectly Elysian--not half a\r\ndegree too hot or too cold--and the air moister than is usual in the dry\r\nclimate of the Northern States, altogether reminding one of Florence in\r\nearly autumn, only less enervating. Ashburner and the Harry Bensons were\r\ngliding up the Hudson in a 'floating palace,' which is American\r\npenny-a-liner for a northriver steamboat. Gerard Ludlow was on board,\r\nhandsome and _distingue_ as ever, but a little thinned and worn by\r\nnumberless polkas. He had got rid of his wife by a mighty effort, and was\r\ngoing to play _le Mari a la Campagne_--not at Ravenswood, however, but with\r\nsome of the Van Hornes who lived higher up the river. While the young\r\nexquisite was rattling on in a sort of Macaronic French to Mrs. Benson\r\nabout the mountains of Switzerland and the pictures of Italy, the ascent of\r\nthe Nile and \"that glorious _Clos-Vougeot Blanc Mousseux_ at the\r\n_Anglais_\"--every topic, in short, that had not the least connection with\r\nAmerica--Ashburner was witnessing for the third time, with unabated\r\nadmiration, the magnificent scenery of the classic American river--for\r\nclassic it is to a New-Yorker since Washington Irving has immortalized its\r\nlegends.\r\n\r\n\"I am glad to see you are not ashamed to show a little enthusiasm,\" said\r\nBenson, as he marked his friend leaning over the forward railing, absorbed\r\nin the view before him. \"Some people don't care much for this sort of\r\nthing. There's my cousin Ludlow, how supremely indifferent he is to it all!\r\nHe is talking to my wife about the last comic opera he saw in Paris, which\r\nrepresents Shakespeare and Queen Bess getting very jolly together.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly one would hardly be able to tell what countryman Ludlow was,\r\nwithout previous knowledge. He seems, like many of your fashionables, very\r\nmuch out of place here.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's true enough; and the man most out of place among them all is my\r\nbrother Carl, whom we are just going to visit.\"\r\n\r\nAshburner's recollection and knowledge of Carl Benson were pretty much\r\ncomprised in a certain luncheon at Ravenswood, which he had found very much\r\nin place, and a very good place for. Henry went on to explain himself.\r\n\r\n\"He prides himself on a regard for two things--sincerity and equity--two\r\nvery estimable virtues, no doubt, but capable of being ridden to death like\r\nall hobbies.\"\r\n\r\nBenson further proceeded to state that he was afraid they would find his\r\nbrother in no very genial mood--that, in fact, he had two special reasons\r\nat that time for being in bad humor. The anti-rent epidemic had broken out\r\nin the vicinity, and his place was threatened with perforation by a\r\nrailroad. The former, however perilous to some of his acquaintance, was no\r\nvery terrible danger to Carl himself, he having as many tenants in the\r\ncountry as his brother had in town--to wit, just one. The latter was\r\nconsiderably more serious in itself, and rendered particularly aggravating\r\nby attendant circumstances. An equally convenient and much safer inland\r\nroute for the railway had been originally proposed; but Mr. Jobson, the\r\nchief engineer, started the project of a new one close along the shore,\r\nrunning through the beautiful private grounds that lined the whole east\r\nbank of the river for a hundred and fifty miles. The true motive for this\r\nchange was, that the company would thus have to pay less for right of way,\r\nsince the inland route would have passed through the cornfields and\r\nvegetable-grounds of farmers, to whom they must have made full compensation\r\nat the market value of the land, whereas by cutting through a private lawn\r\nthey could take the ground at a merely nominal rate, the damage caused to a\r\ngentleman by the destruction of his place for all the purposes of a\r\ncountry-seat being a \"fancy value,\" which jurors and commissioners chosen\r\nfrom the mass of the people, and regarding the aristocratic landholder with\r\nan envious eye, would never pay the least attention to. But either from a\r\nlingering regard for outward decency, or from some other motive, this, the\r\nreal reason, met with only a passing allusion in Mr. Jobson's report. He\r\ncame out boldly, and recommended the river route as calculated to improve\r\nthe appearance of the shore, by filling up bays and cutting off sharp\r\npoints.[20] What made it worse was, that the majority of these very\r\ngentlemen proprietors had been induced to subscribe largely to the road\r\nunder the solemn assurance from leading members of the company (which took\r\ncare not to make itself officially and corporately responsible) that the\r\ninland route would be adopted, which assurance was thrown to the winds as\r\nsoon as the books were filled up. Carl was not to be taken in so; he had\r\nrefused to subscribe to the road, and opposed it to the extent of his small\r\ninfluence from the first; he might be the victim of such people, but he\r\nwould not be their dupe. This was one consolation to him. Another was, that\r\nthe railway, when it did come upon him, which would not be for two years\r\nyet, would not absolutely ruin his place. It would not go through his\r\nhouse, or across the lawn in front of it, or break down his terrace, for\r\nwhich Nature was to be thanked, and not Mr. Jobson. Ravenswood was partly\r\nwithin one of the to-be-improved bays, and, consequently, the rails would\r\ncut it close along the water under the terraced bank. It merely stopped his\r\naccess to the river, which, as he did not yacht, and had room for the\r\nlittle boating he wanted in the adjoining bay, was no great deprivation. At\r\nany rate, the danger anticipated by Harry turned out all moonshine. When\r\nthey stopped at Van Burenopolis (the landing nearest Ravenswood), Carl's\r\nrockaway was on the ground, and in ten minutes their host received them at\r\nhis front door, both his hands out-stretched, and his face lighted up with\r\nunfeigned pleasure.\r\n\r\nCarl Benson was an unflattered likeness of his brother, with a larger nose,\r\nlarge feet, that got into every one's way, coarser hair, and narrower\r\nchest; altogether a rougher and inferior type of form; but he had a fresh\r\nand ruddy complexion, and though he was Henry's senior by six years, there\r\ndid not seem to be more than a twelve-month between them. In dress he was\r\nas quiet as Harry was gay; never cared how old his clothes were, so long as\r\nhe had plenty of clean linen; was often two years behind the fashion;\r\naffected black coats and gray trousers; eschewed enamelled chains, jewelled\r\nwaistcoat-buttons, and other similar fopperies of Young New-York; preferred\r\nshoes (not of patent leather) to boots, and usually tied his cravat in the\r\nsmallest possible bow. Nor was the contrast in manner between the two\r\nbrothers less marked; the elder was shy and retiring before strangers, and\r\nwould have been called a very awkward man anywhere but in England. You\r\nmight easily guess from his way of behaving himself on a first\r\nintroduction, the uncertain style of his movements, and his \"butter-finger\"\r\nfashion of taking hold of things, that he had none of that dexterity in the\r\nlittle every-day occasions of life which distinguished Harry; who, for\r\ninstance, could harness a horse about as soon as his groom, while Carl\r\nwould have been half the day about it, and not have done it well after all;\r\nHarry could carry out a complicated affair of business at one interview,\r\nwithout coming off worst; but his elder brother would have pottered about\r\nit three days, and probably been cheated in the end. This inaptitude for\r\nsmall business, this want of promptitude and dexterity, of presence of mind\r\nand body, so to speak, is not very detrimental in Europe, where a gentleman\r\nwith a tolerably well-filled purse can have so much done for him; but in\r\nAmerica, where the richest man has to do so much for himself, it is a\r\nconstantly recurring inconvenience, and it struck the Englishman almost\r\nimmediately that this, though not especially alluded to by Henry, was one\r\nof the things that made Carl out of place in his own fatherland.\r\n\r\nThe mansion at Ravenswood, which had braved the storms of eighty-five\r\nwinters (a venerable age for an American house), was pitched on a hill\r\ncommanding a view of the Hudson for forty miles. Without, it was built of\r\nrough stone, with an ample wooden _stoop_ running all round it, and a great\r\nvariety of vines and creepers running round all the pillars of the\r\nstoop;--within, it branched off into large halls and spacious rooms, filled\r\nwith antediluvian furniture, and guiltless of the ambitious upholstery\r\nattempts of Young New-York, which in such matters goes ahead of Paris\r\nitself. The library alone, in which Carl lived,--that is to say, he did\r\neverything but dining and sleeping there,--was fitted up in modern style,\r\nfurnished with luxurious arm-chairs and sofas, the walls and ceiling neatly\r\npainted in oak, and the principal window composed of one oval pane of glass\r\nset in a frame, to which the external landscape supplied an exquisite\r\npicture. The hill swept down to the water's edge almost, where it\r\nterminated abruptly in a lofty terrace, ninety feet above the level of the\r\nshore. The woodlands all about--on Benson's place, on the places adjoining,\r\non the opposite bank--would have been beautiful at any time of the year;\r\nnow, when the foliage was changing color, in anticipation of the coming\r\nfrost, they were surpassingly so. As the trees change not all at once, but\r\ndifferent ones assume different tints successively, the natural\r\nkaleidoscope is varied from day to day. The sumach leaf is one of the first\r\nto alter; it becomes a vivid scarlet; then the maple assumes a brilliant\r\nred and gold; then others put on a rich sienna, and others a warm olive.\r\nHere and there were interspersed patches of evergreens, pines looking\r\nalmost blue, and cedars looking quite black from the contrast of the\r\ngorgeous and fiery coloring that surrounded them. The river water was deep\r\nblue; in the little bay north of Ravenswood it shaded off into a soft olive\r\nfrom the reflection of the foliage and grass about it; while beyond the\r\nfurther bank of the Hudson rose the Kaatskill[21] chain, richly wooded to\r\ntheir summits, and painted with the myriad dyes of autumn,--a fitting\r\nbackground to the landscape. Of course the finest part of this view was\r\nbeyond the limits of Ravenswood, but so much of it as belonged to Carl (and\r\nhis grounds covered some two hundred acres) was cleverly disposed with the\r\nhelp of an ingenious landscape-gardener; the trees were cut into\r\npicturesque clumps and vistas, opened at the desirable points. Henry, who\r\nbragged for all the family as well as for himself, took care to inform\r\nAshburner how, when the place came into Carl's possession (or rather into\r\nhis wife's, for by the laws of New-York, the wife's property is absolutely\r\nhers, and out of her husband's control) by the demise of his father-in-law,\r\nthere was hardly a carriage-road on it, and how he had devoted all his\r\nspare income to it for seven years, \"and made it what you see it.\"\r\n\r\nAs the Englishman had nothing to do for some days but to ramble about\r\nRavenswood, and talk to the owner of it, he had full opportunity of\r\nascertaining how far his brother's estimate of him was correct, and also\r\nhow far the difference between the two, particularly in their practical\r\naptitude for business, was attributable to the fact, that one of them had\r\nfinished his education in England, and the other in America, which, for a\r\nNew-Yorker, means in Paris, in Germany, half over the continent of Europe,\r\nin short. His conclusion was, that some of the qualities which made his\r\nhost so \"out of place\" were natural, and that others had been superinduced\r\nupon these by his English education.\r\n\r\nHarry Benson had truly stated, that his brother's prominent trait of\r\ncharacter was sincerity. He used to say of himself, that the fairy had\r\nbestowed on him true Thomas's gift, \"the tongue that ne'er could lie,\" and\r\nthat the consequent incapacities predicted by the Scottish minstrel had\r\nfallen upon him; he could neither buy nor sell, nor pay court to prince or\r\npeer, (that is, in America, to the sovereign people,) nor win favor of fair\r\nlady. Certainly this is a dangerous quality in any country, unless tempered\r\nwith an exquisite tact, which was not among Carl's possessions; but it is\r\npeculiarly dangerous in America, for there is no public (not excepting the\r\nFrench or Irish) that feeds so greedily on pure humbug as the American.\r\n_Populus vult decipi_ there with a vengeance; and when the general current\r\nof feeling has set towards any show or phantasm, moral, political,\r\nliterary, or social, woe to the individual who plants himself in its way!\r\n\r\nEqually correct was the assertion that equity was a leading idea of his\r\nmind. \"Give the devil his due,\" was one of his favorite proverbs; and when\r\nhe said that a thing \"was not fair,\" it seemed to him a conclusive argument\r\nagainst it. His conception of the virtues was the genuine Aristotelian\r\none--a medium between two extremes. Not that he was a lukewarm partisan on\r\nall subjects; but of the people he most disliked--and he was a really \"good\r\nhater\" of some classes, Romanists, for instance, and Frenchmen, and\r\nSouthern slaveholders--he could not bring himself to take any unfair\r\nadvantage. Now it is no news to any one who knows anything of the\r\nAmericans, that they are a nation of violent extremes; the different\r\npolitical parties, theological sects, geographical divisions--the literati\r\nof different cities, even--vituperate and assail one another fearfully,\r\nhardly respecting the laws of the land, much less the principles of natural\r\njustice. Add to all this, that Carl had a naturally elegant and fastidious\r\ntaste, certain to make him aristocratic in sentiment, however democratic he\r\nmight be in principle, and it will be seen that he had a tolerable stock of\r\nincompatibilities to start with before having anything to do with England.\r\n\r\nBut, as if to settle his business completely, and prevent him from ever\r\nbecoming a contented and contenting citizen of his own country, it chanced\r\nthat just at the period of his youth, when, according to the wont of Young\r\nAmerica, dress and billiards formed the main topic of his conversation, and\r\nhe was aspiring to the possession of a fast trotter, accident took him to\r\nEngland, and a series of accidents kept him there, and caused him to make\r\nit his home for several years, and his standpoint for all his continental\r\nexcursions. He grew up to mature manhood among and along with a generation\r\nof Englishmen. He acquired a taste for classical studies, and for that\r\nliterary society, and those habits of literary and ethical criticism which\r\nare nowhere else found in such perfection. His life had always been\r\nstrictly, even prudishly moral; and while casting off the frivolities and\r\nfopperies of his boyhood, he also parted with much of the impulsive and\r\nimperfectly understood religion of his younger days, and replaced it by a\r\nmore sedate and permanent feeling, which never rose to ecstasy of emotion,\r\nbut was always present to him as a daily habit, and was deeply earnest,\r\nwith little outward show.\r\n\r\nSuch a man's tendencies were visibly towards the church; and had Carl been\r\nan Englishman, or continued his sojourn in England, he would have taken\r\norders naturally and inevitably, and might have made a tolerable parson.\r\nBut at home he soon found it impossible to assimilate himself to that\r\nEvangelical party which constitutes the great bulk of the American\r\nreligious community.\r\n\r\nThe three leading tendencies of his character already alluded to, fostered\r\nas they were by his residence abroad, had ended by making him very eclectic\r\nand very unconventional. He took what seemed good to him from every\r\nquarter, without reference to antecedents; and the fact that all the world\r\nabout him were going one way, was just the reason to make him go the other.\r\nThe Puritan denunciations of all who differed from them on points of\r\ntranscendental theology, or of social institutions, seemed to him illiberal\r\nand uncharitable. His religion acted upon him somewhat like the Socratic\r\nDaemon; it restrained him from actions, rather than prompted him to them. He\r\nabhorred all parade of godliness, and shrunk from disclosing his religious\r\nexperiences, as he would have done from disclosing his loves to a mixed\r\nassemblage. There were many things about these people besides their\r\nabhorrence of the fine arts, that shocked his aesthetic sensibility, and\r\ntheir inquisitive censoriousness he deemed ungentlemanly in point of\r\nmanners, and little short of persecution in point of principle. What most\r\nof all repelled him was their unmitigated \"seriousness.\" A certain\r\nnotorious personage, whom it is no scandal to call the greatest of living\r\ncharlatans, is reported to have taken for his motto, \"Praise God, and be\r\nmerry.\" Now this was exactly what Carl wanted to do, to praise God, and be\r\nmerry; and he did not think the latter clause of the device implied any\r\nnecessary incompatibility with the former. He held strongly to the \"_neque\r\nsemper arcum_,\" and thought that a man was all the better man, and better\r\nChristian, for an occasional season of healthy enjoyment. He did not think\r\n\"teetotalism\" necessary to prevent gentlemen from becoming drunkards, and\r\nhe took his regular exercise on Sunday as well as on other days. His\r\nsincere nature revolted equally from the idea of dissembling a merriment\r\nwhich he felt, and from that of simulating a religious enthusiasm which he\r\ndid not feel. With all personal respect for such men, and all reverence for\r\nthe service they had done to the cause of vital religion, and civil, no\r\nless than religious liberty, he very soon found that he could not\r\namalgamate with them, and gave up all intention of going into the church.\r\nThus it came to pass, that letting himself slide into the place which his\r\nfortune and connections had marked out for him, he became a man of society,\r\nand a gentleman of the world. It proved that he was not entirely free from\r\nthe national error of quitting one extreme for another: it could only be\r\nsaid in his defence, that his new _role_ rather came to, than was sought\r\nfor by him. Perhaps his fastidiousness partly led him into it; but this\r\ntrait of his mind showed itself more in intellectual criticism than in\r\nmaterial Sybaritism, and more in the choice of companions than either.\r\nCertainly he had no great qualifications for the part, especially in\r\nNew-York, and very wild work he made of it with his peculiar ideas, some of\r\nwhich were rather English, and all of which were considerably the reverse\r\nof American.\r\n\r\nThe first offence that Carl gave was by getting married in church as\r\nquietly as anything can be done in New-York, and going out of the way\r\nimmediately afterwards, instead of standing his bride up for eight hundred\r\npeople to look at. He was shamefully negligent of his duties to society in\r\nnot having given \"a reception.\" Carl said that he married for the present\r\nhappiness and future comfort of himself and his wife, not for the amusement\r\nof society; and that was all the explanation he deigned to give his\r\nfashionable acquaintances.\r\n\r\nHis next eccentricity was refusing to read _The Sewer_, to let it enter his\r\nhouse, or to talk about it. He said, that in Europe, scandalous newspapers\r\nwere not taken in by respectable families, that even young men read them at\r\ntheir clubs and by stealth, and never mentioned them before ladies; that\r\npeople making pretensions to superior morality and decency ought not to\r\npatronize an immoral and blasphemous print--and more to the same effect.\r\nMen and women who referred to France as the standard of half the things\r\nthey did, taunted him with referring to England. Benson did not think it\r\nworth while to discuss the merits of that case, but answered by a quotation\r\nfrom Aristophanes, how \"clever folks learn many things from their\r\nenemies,\"--which he had to translate before his auditors understood\r\nit,--and by another of like purport from a Latin bard, which they were less\r\nslow to comprehend, as it has become part of the stock in trade of our\r\npublic speakers, and even the editors know what it means. Then one man\r\nliked _The Sewer_ because it had the best reports of trotting matches; and\r\nanother, because it published the news from Washington half-an-hour sooner\r\nthan any of its contemporaries; and they all said, that all the papers were\r\nso bad, it was merely a question of degree, and not of kind. Nobody agreed\r\nwith Carl, not even the people who were abused by _The Sewer_, and he made\r\nno converts out of his own family--his wife, brother, and sister.\r\n\r\nBut his great crime was blaspheming the polka, for which I believe Young\r\nNew-York thought him absolutely insane, and would gladly have put him into\r\na straight-jacket. He thought that a _matinee_ which lasted from noon to\r\nmidnight was an absurd and wicked waste of time; that even six hours a day\r\nwas too much for a reasonable being to devote to the Redowa; that at a ball\r\nor party there should be some place for people who like to converse, and a\r\nnon-dancing man should not be stuck into a corner all the evening on pain\r\nof being knocked over by the waltzers; that the tipsy excesses of the young\r\ngentlemen who lorded it in the ball-room rendered their society not the\r\nmost edifying for ladies; and as whatever he thought he gave utterance to\r\nin pretty plain language, he made himself prodigiously unpopular, and was a\r\ngreat nuisance to the exclusives.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, he found things enough to annoy him. He had no\r\nlike-minded, and it seemed no _like-bodied_ men to associate with; no\r\ngentlemen to converse with on classical subjects, no acquaintances to join\r\nhim in his long walks and drives. He was not over-fond of the French. \"They\r\nmake the best coffee and gloves in the world,\" he used to say, \"but coffee\r\nand gloves, after all, are a very small part of life.\" Therefore it was\r\nirksome to him to hear the French always appealed to as the standard of\r\ndress, furniture, and manners. Above all, it worried him to find their\r\nlanguage the recognized one of the _salon_ and the opera. That two or three\r\npersons, whose native tongue was English, should go on talking imperfect\r\nFrench, (for the knowledge acquired by a two years' residence in Paris must\r\nbe comparatively imperfect,) though no foreigners were present, struck him\r\nas a mischievous absurdity, and directly calculated to hinder mental\r\ngrowth. But all these were petty troubles compared to the misery he endured\r\nfrom the gossiping and scandalous propensities of his fashionable\r\nacquaintance. He now found his error in supposing that there is any\r\npeculiar illiberality and uncharitableness in a religious community, as\r\ndistinguished from a worldly one; and discovered, that in avoiding the\r\nEvangelical connection, he had not escaped the spirit of inquisitive\r\ncensoriousness. A common error of young men is this: they fancy, that\r\nbecause people of the world talk of their liberality, and parade it\r\nostentatiously, they must possess an extra share of it. And doubtless they\r\nare more charitable towards their favorite propensities; the \"jolly good\r\nfellow\" will judge leniently of his bottle companion's trippings, and so on\r\nthrough the calender of vices: though even this proposition is not to be\r\nreceived absolutely. Catiline will sometimes be found complaining of\r\nsedition; most offenders have some lingering sense remaining of original\r\nright and wrong; not enough to keep them straight, but enough to blame\r\nothers for the self-same obliquities. But to try the question correctly, we\r\nshould examine the worldly, not in their judgments of one another, but in\r\ntheir judgments of the religious, and see how much liberality they show\r\nthem. We should watch the hatred of virtue and purity, and the envy of fair\r\nfame, developing themselves in every form of slander and detraction, from\r\nthe sly innuendo to the open falsehood. All merely fashionable society has\r\na necessary tendency to be scandalous; fashionable people must talk a great\r\ndeal without any definite purpose, and personal topics are always the\r\nreadiest at hand for small talk, in a momentary dearth of others--this\r\none's dress and appearance--that one's style of living--who is attentive to\r\nwhom--and so on; so that besides the gossip which springs from deliberate\r\nwickedness, there is a great deal that is the result of mere\r\nthoughtlessness and vacuity. And New-York fashionable society is probably\r\nmore scandalous than any other, because there are fewer public amusements\r\nfor persons of leisure than in the continental cities of Europe, while the\r\nmen have not that vent in political life, or the women in outdoor exercise,\r\nwhich Londoners find.\r\n\r\nNow Carl was imbued with the idea (I believe it was one of his acquired\r\nEnglish ones), that the first duty of a gentleman is to mind his own\r\nbusiness. He had a horror of interfering with any one's private affairs,\r\nand an equal horror of any one interfering with his. It sickened him,\r\ntherefore, to be among people who were always speaking ill of one another,\r\nand fetching and carrying stories. He grew tired of every one in the not\r\nvery large circle of his acquaintance, which his fastidiousness, before\r\nadverted to, had always kept small; for he hated immoral people, and had a\r\nvery imperfect sympathy for vulgar ones; and the man who begins by\r\nexcluding these two classes, will make a large hole in his visiting list.\r\nHe was in danger of becoming morbid and misanthropic. The natural and\r\nproper resource for a person so situated, is to take up some active and\r\nsteady occupation--ride some hobby, if he can do nothing better,--at any\r\nrate, give himself enough to do. Carl was not a man of hobbies, and all the\r\navailable ones were ridden to death already. The first resort of a young\r\nEnglishman, with good fortune and connections, is politics; it is the very\r\nlast resort of a New-Yorker similarly situated. He usually has enough of it\r\nat college; is a violent politician at sixteen, and by nineteen gives up\r\nall thoughts of shining in that way. _Why_ this is so, I will not stop to\r\nexplain at present, as I have no intention of writing a treatise _a la De\r\nTocqueville_ on the working of democratic institutions in America. I only\r\nmention the fact; perhaps you will find some further light thrown on it\r\nbefore we get to the end of this paper.\r\n\r\nTwo refuges lay open before him--business and literature.\r\n\"Business\"--banking, or commerce of some sort, is the shortest way for a\r\nNew-Yorker to dispose of himself; but Carl had neither taste nor ability\r\nfor trading or finance, and was too frank and unsuspecting to make his way\r\nprofitably in a very sharp mercantile community. To literature his ideas\r\nnaturally turned; and in some countries a productive literary life might\r\nhave been his happy destiny. He was not necessitated to write for a\r\nlivelihood, and was just the sort of man to write for reputation. It was\r\nthe occupation for which his tastes and his education fitted him.\r\n\r\nBut he had been too well educated for an American _litterateur_. His\r\nstandard of excellence was pitched too high. The popular models provoked\r\nhis criticism, not his emulation. The exaggerated flattery of newspaper\r\npuffs, and the Little-Peddlingtonism of sectional cliques disgusted him. He\r\nwould not toady others, and disliked being toadied himself. He had too\r\ncorrect an appreciation of newspaper editors, and too much candor to\r\ndisguise this appreciation. His accurate taste was shocked by little\r\nmechanical deficiencies--the carelessness of compositors and\r\nproofreaders--the impossibility of getting a Greek quotation set up\r\ncorrectly. He wrote for elegantly and thoroughly educated men, such as had\r\nbeen the associates of his youth, and found few of his countrymen to read,\r\nand fewer to understand him; consequently, after a brief experience, he\r\ngave up all writing for publication except one species of authorship, which\r\nhad only a semblance of doing others any good, and which did himself a\r\ngreat deal of harm.\r\n\r\nThis was the controversial and satirical, to which he was prompted by an\r\nhonest abhorrence of shams, and in which he was encouraged by the morbid\r\npublic appetite for any thing savoring of personality or approaching to a\r\n\"row\" upon paper. Carl had a knack of saying disagreeable things in a\r\ndisagreeable way, with some point and smartness--was clever in prose\r\nparody, in the _reductio ad absurdum_, in quoting a man against\r\nhimself,--in short, up to all the \"dodges\" of belligerent criticism, and\r\nhad a lively sense and keen perception of the ridiculous; but not priding\r\nhimself as a gentleman and a Christian on these accomplishments, he did his\r\nbest to keep them down, just as he did to keep down any tendency to say\r\nill-natured things in social intercourse, and only gave them play when\r\nprovoked by any flagrant exhibition of imposture. But having once found by\r\nexperiment how this sort of writing took, how an hour's ebullition of\r\nsarcasm would command attention, when two months of research and polish\r\nwere unheeded, and having no lack of material to tempt him, he was seduced\r\ninto it again and again. If a sciolist undertook to put forth a new theory\r\nof the Platonic philosophy without having mastered his Greek grammar, Carl\r\nBenson was at hand to turn him inside out, and show up his pretensions. If\r\na demagogue took up the formulas and watchwords of other times and\r\ncountries, to malign his betters, and stir up one class against another,\r\nCarl was the first to dissent from the popular voice of panegyric, and\r\ndemonstrate in plain terms what mischievous nonsense the lecturer had been\r\nuttering. If a Radical magazine blazoned out the discovery of some\r\nprodigious mare's nest--some awful conspiracy of England against American\r\nliberty or letters, who was so ready as Carl to point out that the editor\r\ncould not spell the most ordinary foreign name straight, and did not\r\nexactly know the difference between _Fraser_ and the _Edinburgh!_\r\nBooksellers and periodicals were glad enough to publish these squibs, and\r\nthe reading public read them fast enough, with considerable amusement, and\r\nno profit or intention of profiting by them; it was _parvis componere\r\nmagna_, like Aristophanes and Cleon; the bystanders cheered the exposer,\r\nand followed the exposed as fast as ever. Carl began to set up for a\r\nprofessed satirist,--one of the worst things that can befall a man, for the\r\nbenefit he confers on others is very problematical, and the evil he\r\ninflicts on himself positive and inevitable.\r\n\r\nHe who had been the merriest of young men found himself growing ill-natured\r\nand morbid when he should have been in the prime of life. It was hard to\r\nsay which he disliked most, the exclusives or the democracy, and he uttered\r\nhis mind about both pretty freely. He was sick of the newspapers, with\r\ntheir bad print and worse principles--of the endless debates about the same\r\nold questions in Congress--of literary pretenders and the thousand and one\r\n\"most remarkable men among us,\"--of all the continuously succeeding popular\r\ndelusions--of the gossiping young men in illimitable cravats, and all the\r\npersonal intelligence about Mr. Brown and Miss Jones. Still he clung to old\r\nGotham for a reason that influenced few people in it. He had strong\r\nconservative feelings and local attachments; his childhood (unlike his\r\nbrother's) had been spent in the city, and the scenes of his childhood were\r\ndear to him, however little interest he might feel in the new characters\r\nthat peopled them. But when in the rapid march of \"up town\" progress, the\r\nhouse which his father built, where his parents had died, and he and his\r\nbrother and sister played as children, became so surrounded by shops, and\r\nstores, and manufactories, that he was fairly driven out of it, then he\r\nwithdrew from the city altogether, and established himself for all the year\r\nround at his--that is to say, at his wife's--place on the Hudson. His\r\ncontemporaries speedily forgot him, or if they ever thought of him, it was\r\nonly as an unhappy recluse, Bellerophon-like, eating his own heart, and\r\nshunning the ways of men.\r\n\r\nHe was nothing of the sort. In quitting the town, he quitted most of his\r\nsources of discontent. He had great capacity of self-amusement when fairly\r\nleft to himself, and could always find interesting occupation in his\r\nlibrary. He now reaped the fruit of his early studies, though not exactly\r\nin the way he had once hoped and anticipated. His place, too, amused him\r\ngreatly, and, not keeping up two establishments, he had money in abundance\r\nto spend on it. He revelled in out-of-door exercise; it was a constant\r\npleasure to him to gallop his blood mare (a taste for horses ran in the\r\nfamily) over fresh grass, where there were no omnibuses or fast trotters in\r\nhis way. Nor was he without society; those who are unpopular with the\r\nmajority can generally boast a few of the warmest personal friends, and it\r\nwas so in his case. They came to visit him by intervals and relays,--real\r\nworthies of literature, who had been his father's friends before they were\r\nhis,--quiet men of general tastes and accomplishments, like Philip Van\r\nHorne; now and then a like-minded stranger, such as Ashburner, or his\r\nsister and her husband, a good-natured, gentlemanly, ornamental\r\nPhiladelphian; or his brother Harry. But most of all was he happy in his\r\nfamily circle: a man of the warmest domestic affections, he rejoiced in the\r\nsociety of his children and the cheering presence of his wife. We owe this\r\nlady an apology for not bringing her forward sooner: it would have been\r\nmore in accordance with the grammar of gallantry to \"put the more worthy\r\nperson first.\" And yet, reader, may it not be better to keep the good wine\r\ntill the last, and after telling you a great deal about a man whom you may\r\nnot like, then to tell you something about a woman whom you must, or, at\r\nleast, you ought to like? So let me present you to Mrs. Carl Benson.\r\n\r\nHenry Benson used to say that Carl had carried out his eclectic principles\r\nin the choice of his wife, for she was something between a blonde and a\r\nbrunette, and had dark eyes and light hair. She was a tall woman (according\r\nto the American standard of female height--I am not sure that she would\r\nhave been considered so in England), and her figure rose up straight and\r\nspringy as a reed. Altogether, she was in beautiful preservation, which is\r\nmore than can be said for every American woman who has mounted into \"the\r\nthirties,\" and is the mother of three children. Her shoulders were\r\nmagnificent, her bust good, her arms and hands exquisitely moulded, her\r\nfeet and ankles neatly turned, her features regular, yet not wanting in\r\nexpression, and her complexion almost perfect. Still, with all these\r\nelements of beauty, and though of good family (she was one of the Van\r\nHornes) and sufficient worldly prospects, she had never been a great belle,\r\nand this was an additional charm in her husband's eyes, who would never\r\nhave deeply loved a woman that all the world ran after. Indeed, she had not\r\nbelle accomplishments or tastes, preferred singing English ballads to\r\nItalian arias, and galloping over the county all the morning to dancing at\r\na ball all night. And she was so insensible to the advantage of a cavalier\r\n_per se_, that she would rather talk to an amusing woman than to a stupid\r\nman, however handsome and fashionable. Of toilet mysteries she knew enough\r\nto keep her from dressing badly, but not enough to make her dress well and\r\neffectively. Her talents were not of the showy order, and did not fit her\r\nfor shining in a _salon_. She had good (not extraordinary) natural\r\nabilities, and had been beautifully \"coached,\" first by her father, and\r\nafterwards by her husband, so that without any pedantry or _bas-bleu_-ism,\r\nshe displayed an extensive acquaintance with literary topics, but she was\r\nnot brilliant in small talk, in playful raillery, or cut-and-thrust\r\nrepartee. When she was in Paris (as Miss Louisa Van Horne), the French\r\ncould make nothing of her; they thought her a handsome bit of marble, cold,\r\nunimpassioned, and uninteresting. And when more lately Vincent Le Roi came,\r\nas Henry's _umbra_, to pass a few days at Ravenswood, the Vicomte went away\r\nsaying that Madame Carl Benson was undoubtedly an angel, but, for his part,\r\nhe didn't like angels; they were very misty and insipid; he much preferred\r\n_les filles d'Eve_. And all who knew Le Roi agreed that he would not know\r\nwell what to do with an angel. On the other hand, it must be set off\r\nagainst the deficiencies above mentioned, that she was a true and loving\r\nwife, a fond mother, a benevolent lady, and a sincere Christian.\r\n\r\nSuch was--no, such was not the mistress of Ravenswood. I feel the attempted\r\nportrait is inadequate. A passing description cannot do justice to the\r\nwoman any more than a passing interview. Her superficial blemishes--want of\r\nease in her conversation, or of crinoline in her dress,--were obvious to\r\nthe casual observer; but the sterling qualities of her character, her truth\r\nand honesty, her constancy of affection, her unworldly disposition, her\r\nloftiness of soul--all these, as they could only be properly appreciated by\r\nthose who had known her for years, so can they only be generally and\r\nvaguely hinted at in a brief sketch like this. The great mystery was, how\r\nshe came to marry Carl. Every one said she was too good for him, and he\r\nwould have been the last man to deny it. Perhaps she was pleased with his\r\nsimple integrity, and foresaw that he would make a most affectionate\r\nhusband, though it was not in his nature to be a passionate lover. Perhaps\r\nshe pardoned his awkwardness in regard for his honesty.\r\n\r\nAfter all, I would not claim that she was morally perfect; very few of us\r\nare. I am afraid she was rather censorious, and judged harshly of sinners;\r\nthat in her own comfortable position she did not always weigh accurately\r\nthe temptations of others. It is a common practice of very good and moral\r\npeople to indemnify themselves for their virtue by depreciation of others;\r\n'tis an error that lurks at the heels of Christian duty; for are we not\r\n_commanded_ to hate sin? and the transition from the abstract to the\r\nconcrete is so easy.\r\n\r\nI fancy, too, she did not harmonize altogether with Mrs. Henry Benson.\r\nIndeed, the two sisters-in law made little secret of their mutual\r\nincompatibility. Clara said that Louisa was very proper and very stupid,\r\nregular as a machine, and with no fun or frolic in her--that the only man\r\nshe ever had about her, her cousin Philip, was as dull as herself,--that\r\nshe dressed badly, and talked bad French,--that she went to church in the\r\nmorning, and gossiped in the afternoon, and was more charitable to the\r\nbodies of her inferiors than to the souls of her equals. Louisa looked down\r\nupon Clara as a worldly and frivolous little creature, who fostered her\r\nbeauty to attract admirers and worried her husband to death by her\r\ncaprices, who wasted her time in dancing and flirting, and her money in\r\nParisian nick-nacks, or in giving parties to people who did not care for\r\nher. In short, the two ladies said many hard things of each other when\r\nseparate, and were painfully amiable when together.\r\n\r\nBut these bickerings did not greatly impair the happiness of our party at\r\nRavenswood. The brothers loved each other as much as if they had _not_ been\r\nbrothers, and had not had to divide a large family estate between them.\r\nEven their wives' quarrels could not make them quarrel.\r\n\r\nMany a jolly turn had they and their guest, lounging with their cigars\r\nafter breakfast on the vine-trellised stoop, or under the spreading\r\nhorse-chesnuts at one corner of the house, watching the white sails that\r\nglided by on the sunny water, and the fantastic cloudlets that floated in\r\nthe clear sky; strolling through the winding walks, or across the terrace\r\nat evening, when the setting sun had piled red clouds like a huge volcano\r\nover the Hudson, and the Kaatskills looked like great blocks of lapis\r\nlazuli, their summits half veiled in fiery mist; riding through the\r\nadjacent country in bright moonlight nights, now threading their way among\r\nthe uncertain bridle-paths of a dense wood, and anon startling a village\r\nwith their clattering hoofs and boisterous merriment as they swept by it at\r\nfull gallop; driving four-in-hand a livelong day to visit friends who lived\r\nnorth or south of them on the rivers, by roads that rose up over the hills\r\nand showed all the glorious panorama of the Hudson, and then dipped down\r\ninland among picturesque glens and water-courses and mill-streams. Capital\r\ngame breakfast they had, which the women were not too sentimental to help\r\nthem in doing justice to; and excellent plain dinners, with oceans of iced\r\nchampagne; and when the cloth was drawn, Carl would chirp over his claret\r\nwith as comfortable a melancholy as ever any \"ruined\" Protectionist\r\ngentleman in Old England gave utterance to.\r\n\r\nAt a very early period of their acquaintance, Henry Benson had put\r\nAshburner up to the way of getting at the dark side of things in America.\r\n\"Never assail anything,\" he said; \"if you do, the people will tackle you,\r\nfrom the highest to the lowest. _Let an American gentleman talk_; give him\r\nhis head, and he will soon lead you on the track you want.\" Acting on this\r\nhint, the Englishman let his host talk; what little he said himself would\r\ncome in the form of a query or suggestion. \"You lead a very nice life\r\nhere,\" he would say, \"but it is rather quiet. I should think an active man\r\nlike yourself would choose some more stirring form of existence.\" Then Carl\r\nblazed out.\r\n\r\n\"Go into politics, I suppose! A nice business that for an honest man and a\r\ngentleman! Why, Ashburner, the democracy of our State, who are always in\r\nfear of being reduced to vassalage by a few thousand easy and unambitious\r\nrich men, have lost their liberties without perceiving it to hundreds of\r\nthousands of alien settlers with their foreign priests. A successful\r\npolitician here is either a hack lawyer of thirty years' standing, who has\r\nhad opportunity enough of getting used to the devil's work in his first\r\nbusiness, or an upstart demagogue, who has made his way by dint of sheer\r\nbrass; either a blind partisan, who knows nothing outside of \"the regular\r\nticket,\" or a \"non-committal\" man, who says everything to everybody, and\r\nnever gave an intelligible, manly, straightforward opinion in his life. One\r\nparty would sell us body and soul to the Slaveholders, and the other to the\r\nAnti-renters, and both to the Irish. If I could bring myself to enter the\r\nlists with such people, I should have to start with the dead weight of\r\nbeing a \"millionaire\" (as they call every man here who has two or three\r\nhundred thousand dollars) and an \"aristocrat\" (as they call every man who\r\nhas the habits and education of a gentleman). There is not a voter in this\r\ncounty has less influence than I have;--to be sure, I don't try for any,\r\nbecause I well know that by doing so, I should only make myself more\r\nunpopular, without becoming any more influential. Or be a leader of\r\nfashion, perhaps--one of those people who talk scandal about one another\r\nall day long when they are not dancing, who try to pursue pleasure in a\r\nplace where every one else is at work, and are so destitute of resources,\r\nthat they quarrel for pure want of something to do. See what they have made\r\nof my brother, who is a clever fellow and a well-educated man, though I say\r\nit. He is becoming a third-rate dancer--one of Tom Edwards's _corps_; is\r\ngrowing frivolous and scandalous, and getting his earnest honesty knocked\r\nout of him every day. Or profess literature, possibly--Henry does a little\r\nof that too; you may see him in the magazines sandwiched between the last\r\nlearned cobbler and the newest Laura Matilda of the West. No, I don't want\r\nto belong to any \"Mutual Admiration\" Society, and if I did, it's too late\r\nnow. My mind has been spoken so often and so freely, that were I to write\r\na book as good as one of Fenimore Cooper's, (if you can imagine the\r\npossibility of such a thing even in hypothesis) no editor would notice it,\r\nand no one read it--unless it contained something personal. Here I shall\r\nstay and amuse myself in what one of our ex-great men used to call\r\n\"dignified retiracy;\" and if this railroad drives me out, why, then,\r\n_ingens iterabimus aequor_--to England, were I a bachelor, but my wife\r\ncouldn't live there; no American woman can, after the attention she has\r\nbeen used to at home, except the ambassador's wife--so it will probably be\r\nto Italy, or perhaps to Paris, for a man can find occupation there,\r\nwhatever be his peculiar bent, and fill up his time well in the place\r\nwithout knowing or liking the people.\"\r\n\r\n\"It does surprise me,\" said Ashburner, \"that the terminus of a refined\r\nAmerican's dream should always be Paris,--that whenever a man has means and\r\nleisure, he runs off thither, and stays as long as he can: and if not\r\nthere, in some other place--anywhere but at home.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come now,\" broke in Henry Benson; he had retired with the ladies after\r\ndinner, and now rejoined the men to have some more claret,--\"don't you\r\nEnglish run over to Paris perpetually, and all around the continent? Don't\r\nwe meet you everywhere in the four quarters of the globe? You don't like to\r\nstay at home any more than we do; only we are franker than you, and avow\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"We _go_ away from home, but we don't like to _stay_ away,\" replied the\r\nEnglishman.\r\n\r\n\"Exactly; and if we had a _pied-a-terre_ close to the continent as you\r\nhave, we should not like to stay away from home either--more than half the\r\nyear. Here has Carl been making his moan to you about our unappreciated\r\ncondition; it's always his way over the decanters--one of his amusements\r\nmerely. (Carl, old fellow, pass the Laffitte this way.) Well, I think,\" and\r\nhe paused to fill a brimming glass, \"that we are very jolly victims; and\r\nfor my part, I am quite disposed to play, regardless of my doom. Look at\r\nour wives and children, our houses and horses, our whole style of living.\r\nPonder well on this _Bourdeaux;_ ruminate on those woodcocks we have been\r\ndiscussing. What miserable misused fellows we are! We _do_ live in a great\r\ncountry--we have such civil and religious liberty as is enjoyed in only one\r\nother country in the world; and if we don't have the management of the\r\ngovernment, why no one here or abroad holds us responsible for what the\r\ngovernment does, and that is just the condition Plato thought a philosopher\r\nshould pray for. Fill up again, brother mine, and thank your stars that you\r\nhave your time to yourself, and are not a parliament man, as Ashburner is\r\ngoing to be, and are not set to work twelve hours a day among blue books\r\nand red tape.\"\r\n\r\nAnd now, reader, these papers, which have been running on for a year or\r\nmore, are wound up. I did not begin them intending to give you anything\r\nmarvellous, or new, or profound about the aspect, prospects, and destiny,\r\npolitical, religious, or literary, of the great people among whom I am a\r\nsmall unit. I only intended to present you with some phases of outward life\r\nand manners--such things as would strike or interest a stranger in our\r\nbeloved Gotham, and in the places to which regular Gothamites--American\r\ncockneys, so to speak--are wont to repair. For I am but a cockney in my own\r\ncountry; I have never travelled far in it,--good reason why, when they are\r\napt to hang up a man at one end of the Union for what is a sort of religion\r\nat the other. They did not aspire to be \"Sketches of American Society\"\r\n(that was an honorary prefix of yours, Mr. Editor), nor even Sketches of\r\nNew-York Society, but only of a very small class of persons in New-York;\r\nand therefore I had originally headed them \"The Upper Ten Thousand,\" in\r\naccordance with a phrase established by Mr. Willis, though even that is an\r\nexaggeration, for the people so designated are hardly as many hundred. In\r\ntruth, I began the series chiefly to amuse some Cantab friends of mine, who\r\nwere curious to know how the gentlemen that were their contemporaries and\r\nrepresentatives in our Atlantic cities, lived, and eat, and dressed, and\r\namused themselves; what their habits and pursuits and propensities were.\r\nThe last thing that I expected was that any of them should be read, much\r\nless republished, on my side the water. To a New-Yorker, many things which\r\nthey contain must necessarily appear stale, stupid, and commonplace. For\r\ninstance, in one number half a page is taken up with the description of a\r\ntrotting-wagon; to an American I should as soon think of describing a pair\r\nof boots; the one is as familiar an object to him as the other. But at the\r\nvery first number, some clever folks took it into their heads that they\r\nwere to be very personal,--that every character described or even alluded\r\nto in them was to represent a real living prototype; that was enough to\r\nmake them sought after. And it really did happen that in that first number\r\nI had described a sleigh which actually existed in real wood and iron\r\nsomewhere about the city; and the inference above detailed was obvious. It\r\nis not every story in Gotham that has so much foundation; in fact, they get\r\nthem up frequently without any foundation to speak of, only unfortunately\r\nthe narratives don't fall to the ground as readily as the houses do. It is\r\nhardly worth while contradicting such idle rumors, but to my American\r\nreaders (since I have some, much to my own amazement) I wish to say one\r\nthing once for all--that Harry Benson is not meant to represent any living\r\nindividual whatsoever, and that his wife, house, horses, and other\r\naccessaries, are not designed after the corresponding appurtenances of any\r\nreal person. And the same remark applies with equal force to all the\r\nappendages of Carl Benson, as delineated in this very sketch.\r\n\r\nStill, I suppose I ought to be obliged to the members of \"our set\" who got\r\nup this idea; for the factitious interest thus communicated to these papers\r\nhas caused them to be reprinted (in the cheap and multitudinous style of\r\nAmerican reprints), and thus to become known to the outsiders both of our\r\nown city and of other parts of the country, who could perhaps judge them\r\nmore fairly on their own merits, from having no knowledge of, or interest\r\nin, the local celebrities supposed to be portrayed in them. Some have been\r\ndisposed to accept them as what they were really meant for--light sketches\r\nof life and manners in a certain circle; some have had the bad taste to wax\r\nfurious at them. I understand that a few southern editors have departed\r\nfrom their usual stoical calmness and dignified reserve on the subject, to\r\nassail me for my occasional allusions to \"the peculiar institution;\" and am\r\ntold (life is too short, and time too precious, to read such things\r\noneself, but there are always good-natured friends to put you up to them)\r\nthat a correspondent of the _Ochloratic Review and No Government Advocate_,\r\nwho probably never wore a decent coat in his life, and regards every man in\r\na clean shirt as an oppressor of the people, has seriously taken me to ask\r\nfor representing some of my characters as elegantly dressed! If this\r\nindividual could find nothing worse to say of my papers, _after nine months\r\nexamination of them_, methinks he might have continued to hold his tongue;\r\nbut I suppose any trash will do for the _Ochlocratic_.\r\n\r\nWhether the abuse of these persons, or the praise of others, or my own\r\ninclination, may tempt me hereafter to essay something more definite and\r\nconnected, I will not say at present. Of the things that \"lie on the knees\r\nof the Gods,\" it becomes no man to speak prematurely. Meanwhile, make a\r\nlong arm across the Atlantic--So--shake hands, and good-bye!\r\n\r\n                                              FRANK MANHATTAN.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[20] A literal fact. Washington Irving's residence was among those\r\ndisfigured by this operation, which made havoc of all the oldest and most\r\nbeautiful properties in the State.\r\n\r\n[21] Commonly written _Catskill_; but I believe the above is the genuine\r\nDutch orthography.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Dickens's Household Words.\r\n\r\nTHE FLYING ARTIST.\r\n\r\n\r\nKarl Herwitz is a German. He is about fifty years of age, and one of the\r\nmost original of characters. Since I have know [known] him, I have passed\r\nwhole nights in listening to his adventures, which are in general as\r\ninstructive as they are amusing. Married at a very early age, he left the\r\nmilitary career for that of inventions. He had a most marvellous talent for\r\nconceiving novel machines, often of practical utility; but his soul was set\r\nupon perfecting a flying machine. To this he had devoted nearly his whole\r\nlife. He made models, he tried experiments, he brought to bear all his\r\nprodigious knowledge of mathematics on the subject of travelling in air,\r\nwith an enthusiasm, a childish earnestness, which is not uncharacteristic\r\nof genius. He studied every natural law which was likely to advance him\r\ntowards the consummation of all his hopes and desires--namely, the ability\r\nto fly. At one time his little garden was turned into an aviary. He filled\r\nit with birds of various kinds, to study the mechanism of their powers of\r\nflight. There was the eagle and the dove, the vulture and the sparrow, all\r\nof which were made subservient to his darling object. He has often\r\nexplained all this to me. \"The Golden Eagle,\" he once said, \"can cleave the\r\nair at the rate of forty miles an hour. Now, if I can succeed in imitating\r\nthe mechanism by which he travels in space, exactly and efficiently, of\r\ncourse, my machine will move in the air at the same pace.\" What could I\r\nsay? No argument, no warning, availed. Still he went on, hoping and\r\nworking, and buying expensive tools and materials. He completed aerial\r\nships one after another; and although none of them answered, he was never\r\ndiscouraged.\r\n\r\nAt one time, however, he thought he had succeeded. His contrivance was a\r\ncurious affair, shot out of a bomb; but it was about as buoyant as a shot,\r\nfell, and failed, disheartening everybody but the persevering projector.\r\nStill he did not wholly neglect useful productions, and several times made\r\nimprovements in mechanism, and sold them for very good prices. But the\r\nmoney went as fast as it came. His winged Pegasus was a merciless Ogre,\r\nwhich swallowed up all the money the old German earned.\r\n\r\nLast Christmas-eve, in Paris, five of us were collected, after dinner,\r\nround a roaring fire, half wood, half charcoal. For some time the\r\nconversation was general enough. We spoke of England and of an English\r\nChristmas. The magic spell of the fireside was felt, and the word \"home\"\r\nhung on the trembling lip of all; for we were in a foreign land; we were\r\nall English, save one. There was a lawyer, the most unlawyer-like man I\r\never knew, a noble-hearted fellow, whom to know is to like; there was a\r\npoet, of an eccentric order of merit, whose love of invective, bitter\r\nsatire, and intense propensity to hate--whose fantastic and Germanic cast\r\nof philosophy will ever prevent his succeeding among rational beings; then\r\nthere was an artist, a young man well known in the world, not half so much\r\nas he deserves, if kindness of soul could ever make a man famous; there was\r\nCitizen Karl Herwitz, as he loved to be called; lastly myself. I had been\r\nspeaking of some far-off land, relating some personal adventure; and, with\r\ncommendable modesty, feeling that I had held possession of the chair quite\r\nlong enough, paused for a reply.\r\n\r\n\"Tell us your adventures at the Court of Konningen,\" said the poet,\r\nstanding up to see that his hair hung tastefully around his shoulders,\r\naddressing at the same time Karl, and mentioning the name of one of the\r\nsmaller German states. \"I have heard it before, but it will be new to the\r\nrest, and I promise them a rich treat.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" sighed the German, with a huge puff at his long pipe; \"that _was_ an\r\nadventure--or rather a whole string of adventures. I have told it several\r\ntimes; but, if you like, I will tell it again.\"\r\n\r\nAll warmly called on the German to keep his promise. After freshly loading\r\nhis pipe, and taking a drain at his glass, he drew his arm-chair closer to\r\nthe fire, settled his feet on the _chenets_, and began his narrative in a\r\nquaint and strange English, which I shall not seek to copy:--\r\n\r\n\"I had spent all my money. I had sold all my property. There remained\r\nnothing but a little furniture in my house, which was in a quiet retired\r\nquarter of the town; but then I had completed a machine, and sent it for\r\nthe approval of the Minister of the Interior, who promised to purchase it\r\nfor the government. I now looked forward with delight to a long career of\r\nsuccess, and saw the completion of my flying machine in prospect. On this I\r\ndepended, and still depend, for fame, reputation, and fortune.\r\n\r\n\"I had then a good wife and four children; she is dead now.\" The German\r\npaused, puffed away vigorously at his pipe, and tried to hide his emotion\r\nfrom our view by enveloping himself in smoke.\r\n\r\n\"I was naturally impatient for some result,\" he continued, when his face\r\nbecame once more visible.--\"I used to go every day to the Minister, and\r\nwait in the antechamber, with other suitors, for my turn. Weeks passed, and\r\nthen months, and yet it never came. But we must all eat, and six mouths are\r\nnot fed for nothing. We had no resources, save our clothes and our\r\nfurniture. My clothes were needed to go out with, so the furniture went\r\nfirst. One article was sold, and the produce applied by my careful wife to\r\nthe wants of the family. We had come to that point when food is the only\r\nthing which must be looked on as a necessity. We lived hardly indeed.\r\nBread, and a little soup, was all we ever attempted to indulge in.\"\r\n\r\nSix months passed without any change for the better. I went to the\r\nMinister's every day; sometimes I saw him, and sometimes I did not. He was\r\nalways very polite, bowed to me affably, said my machine was under\r\nconsideration, should be reported on immediately, and passed on his way. It\r\nwas the dead of winter. Every article of furniture was now gone, my wife\r\nand children having not gone out for two months for want of clothes. We\r\nhuddled together, for warmth, on two straw mattresses, in the corner of an\r\nempty room, without table, without chairs, without fire. Catherine had\r\nnothing to wear but an old cotton gown and one under-garment. We had not\r\neaten food for a day and a night, when I rose in the morning to go to the\r\nMinister's. I felt savage, irate, furious. I thought of my starving and\r\nperishing family, of the long delay which had taken place in the\r\nconsideration of my machine. I compared the luxurious ease of the Minister\r\nwith my own position, and was inclined to do some desperate act. I think I\r\ncould have turned conspirator, and have overthrown the Government. I was\r\nalready half a misanthrope.\r\n\r\nWhen I entered the Minister's antechamber, I placed myself, as usual, near\r\nthe stove. I kept away from the well-dressed mob as much as possible. They\r\nwere solicitors, it is true, and humble enough, some of them; but then they\r\nhad good coats on, smart uniforms, polite boots, and came, perhaps, in\r\ncarriages. I came on foot, clad in a long frock reaching almost to my\r\nheels, patched in several places; with trousers so darned about the calves\r\nas to be almost falling to pieces; with boots which were absolutely only\r\nworn for look, for they had no soles to them. My hat, too, was a\r\ndreadful-looking thing. This day, being faint with hunger, and pinched by\r\nthe cold, the heat of the room overcame me, and I grew dizzy. I am sure I\r\nknew nothing of what passed around. I saw my wife and children, through a\r\nmisty haze, starving with hunger and cold. A basket full of logs of wood\r\nlay beside my knee. Reckless, wild, not caring who saw me, I took a thick\r\nlog, huddled it under my frock, and went away. I passed the porter's lodge\r\nunseen; I was in the open air; I was proud, I was happy. _I had stolen a\r\nlog of wood_; but my children would have fire for one day.\r\n\r\nWhen I got home I went to bed. I was feverish and ill; wild shapes floated\r\nround me; I saw the officers of justice after me; I beheld a furious mob\r\nchasing me along interminable fields; and on every hedge, and every tree,\r\nand every house, and every post, I read, in large letters, the word\r\n\"thief.\" It was evening when I awoke. I looked around for some minutes\r\nwithout moving or speaking; a delicious fragrance seemed to fill the air, a\r\nfire blazed on the hearth, and round it huddled my wife and children,\r\nsitting on logs of wood. I rubbed my eyes. The presence of these logs of\r\nwood seemed to convince me that I still dreamed. But there was an odor of\r\nmutton broth, which was too real to be mistaken.\r\n\r\n\"Catherine,\" said I, \"why, you seem to have some food.\"\r\n\r\nAll came rushing to my bedside, mother and children. They scarcely spoke;\r\nbut one brought a basin of broth, another a hunch of bread, another a plate\r\nof meat and potatoes, which had been kept hot before the fire. I was too\r\nfaint and sick to talk. I took my broth slowly. Never did food prove a\r\ngreater blessing. Life, reason, courage, hope, all seemed to return, as\r\nmouthful by mouthful I swallowed the nourishing liquid. It spread warmth\r\nand comfort through every fibre of my frame. When I had taken this, I ate\r\nthe meat, and vegetables, and bread, without fear. While I did so, my\r\nwife, sending the children back to the fire-place, told me, in a whisper,\r\nhow she had procured such unexpected subsistence. It seems that scarcely\r\nhad I got home, and, after flinging my log on the ground, rushed to bed,\r\nwhen a knock came to the door. Catherine went to answer it. A man of middle\r\nage entered. He gave a hurried glance around, seemed to shudder at its\r\nemptiness, looked at the next room through the open door, saw that it was\r\nas bare as the other, turned his eyes away from the crouching form of my\r\nhalf-dressed wife, and spoke:--\r\n\r\n\"Have you any children?\"\r\n\r\n\"Four,\" said Catherine, tremblingly; but, still, answering at once, so\r\nperemptory was the tone of the stranger.\r\n\r\n\"How long have you been in this state?\"\r\n\r\n\"Six months.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your husband is Karl Herwitz, the mechanist?\"\r\n\r\n\"He is, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, madam, please to tell him that I recognized him as he came out of\r\nthe Minister's of the Interior, and, noticing what he clutched with such\r\nwild energy, followed him here. Tell him, I am not rich, but I can pay my\r\ndebts; I owe him the sum contained in this purse. I am happy to pay it.\"\r\n\r\n\"And did he owe it you?\" said I, anxiously.\r\n\r\nNo, replied Karl; he had never seen me or heard of me before. Generous\r\nEnglishman! I shall never forget him. I found out afterwards that he was a\r\ncommercial traveller, with a large family and a moderate income. On what he\r\nleft we lived a month, by exercising strict economy. I did not go to the\r\nMinister's for several days. I feared some one might have seen me, and I\r\nwas bowed by shame. But, at last, I mustered courage, and presented myself\r\nat the audience. I was, as usual, totally unnoticed, and I resumed my\r\nwretched dangling in the antechamber, as usual. The result was always the\r\nsame. Generally I caught a glimpse of the Minister; but, when I did, it was\r\neternally the same words. Meanwhile time swept rapidly by, and soon my\r\nmisery was as great as ever. My children, who during the past month had\r\nrecovered a little their health and looks, looked pale and wan again. I was\r\nmore shabby, more dirty, more haggard and starved-looking than ever. Once\r\nagain I went out, after our all being without food for some twenty-four\r\nhours. I knew not what to do. I walked along the street turning over every\r\npossible expedient in my mind.\r\n\r\nSuddenly I saw, on the opposite side of the way, a lieutenant belonging to\r\nthe regiment I had quitted. He had been my intimate friend, but so shabby\r\nwas I, that I sought to avoid him. He saw me, however, and, to my surprise,\r\nhurried across and shook me heartily by the hand. I could scarcely restrain\r\ntears; so sure was I, in my present state, to be cut by even old friends.\r\nBut, in my worst troubles, something has always turned up to make me love\r\nand cherish the human heart.\r\n\r\n\"My poor Karl,\" said he, \"the world uses you badly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very;\" said I: and in a few words I told my story.\r\n\r\n\"My dear Karl!\" he exclaimed, when I had concluded, \"I was going to ask you\r\nto dine with me on what I have left. I am come up to claim a year's arrears\r\nof pay, and have been sent back with a free passage and promises. But I\r\nhave a little silver; and, as I said, meant to ask you to devour it. But\r\nafter what you have told me, will you share my purse with me for your wife\r\nand children's sake?\" And he pulled out a purse containing about the value\r\nof five shillings English, forced me to take half, shook me heartily by the\r\nhand, and hurried away to escape my thanks.\r\n\r\nHome I rushed with mad eagerness, a loaf in one hand, the rest of the money\r\nin the other. My poor wife once more could give food to her little ones. On\r\nthe morning of the third day after I had obtained this little help, I lay\r\nin bed, ruminating. I was turning over in my mind every possible expedient\r\nby which to raise enough money to go on with, a brief time, until my\r\nmachine was really decided on by the Government. Suddenly I sat up in my\r\nbed and addressed my wife:\r\n\r\n\"How much money have you got left, Catherine?\"\r\n\r\nShe had threepence of your money.\r\n\r\n\"Can you manage with the loaf of bread then, and three-halfpence for\r\nto-day?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have often managed on less,\" said she.\r\n\r\n\"Then give me three-halfpence to take out with me.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what are you going to do? We may have nothing to-morrow, and then the\r\nthree-halfpence will be missed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Give!\" said I, rather sternly, reflecting as I was on my scheme; \"be\r\nassured, it is for our good.\"\r\n\r\nMy poor wife gave me the money with a very ill grace, but without another\r\nword; and, rising, I went out. When in the street, I directed my footsteps\r\ntowards the outskirts. They were soon reached. I halted before a tavern\r\nfrequented wholly by workmen, and going into the public room, called for a\r\n_choppe_ of beer. I had purposely chosen my position. Before me was a\r\nhandsome, neatly-dressed young workman, who, like all his companions, was\r\nsmoking and drinking beer. Quietly, without saying a word, I drew out a\r\nsmall note-book and a drawing-pencil. I was then considered a very good\r\nartist; but had only used my pencil to sketch models. But I now sketched\r\nthe human face with care and anxiety. Presently, as my pencil was laid\r\ndown, a man sitting next to me peeped over my shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"Why!\" he cried, \"that's Alexis, to the life.\"\r\n\r\n\"How so?\" said the man I had been sketching, holding out his hand, into\r\nwhich I put my note-book.\r\n\r\n\"Good!\" cried he, while a smile of satisfaction covered his face. \"Will you\r\nsell this? I should like to keep it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will sell it if you like,\" replied I, as quietly as I could, though my\r\nheart was nigh bursting with excitement.\r\n\r\n\"How much?\"\r\n\r\nI knew my man, and asked but six sous, threepence, which the workman gladly\r\npaid, while five others followed his example, at the same price. I went\r\nhome a proud and happy man with my thirty-six pence of copper. Would you\r\nbelieve it? that was the commencement of a long and prosperous career,\r\nwhich lasted until the Revolution of 1848 threw me back again. Six months\r\nafter, I received a thousand florins for a portrait in oil of the Grand\r\nDuchess of B----; and about the end of the same year I drove up to the\r\nHotel of the Minister of the Interior in a splendid carriage, a gentleman\r\nby my side; it was the English commercial traveller.\r\n\r\nWe had a letter of audience, and were admitted at once. The Minister rose,\r\nand after a very warm greeting, requested us to be seated. We took chairs.\r\n\r\n\"My dear Herwitz,\" said the Minister, a little, bowing, smirking man, \"what\r\ncan I do for you? Glad to see you doing so well. The Grand Duchess says\r\nwonders of you. I will have the committee on your machine.\"\r\n\r\n\"I beg your pardon,\" said I, \"but I have come to request your written order\r\nfor its removal. I have sold it to the English house represented by this\r\ngentleman.\"\r\n\r\n\"Its removal!\" cried the astonished Minister; \"impossible! so excellent an\r\ninvention should not pass into the hands of foreigners.\"\r\n\r\n\"So I thought,\" replied I, coldly, \"when for nine months I waited daily in\r\nyour antechamber, with my family starving at home. But it is now sold. My\r\nword is my bond.\"\r\n\r\nThe Minister bit his lip, but made no reply. He took up a sheet of paper,\r\nand wrote the order for removal. I took it, bowed stiffly, and came away.\r\n\r\nWe all heartily thanked the old German for his narrative. Since the\r\nRevolution, and the consequent impossibility of selling his machines in\r\nGermany, he has come to Paris, and taken to portrait-painting once more.\r\nHis perseverance and endurance are untiring. His wife died long since, and\r\nhe is like a mother to his four girls;--all of whom are most industrious\r\nand devoted. He still believes in his flying machine; but, for the sake of\r\nhis parental love, his hard-working head and fingers--for the sake of his\r\ngoodness of soul, his eccentricities, he must be forgiven for this\r\ninvincible credulity.\r\n\r\nNone can fail to admire the original dreamer when he is also a practical\r\nworker; while few will be willing to patronize the mere visionary, who is\r\nalways thinking and never doing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Ainsworth's Magazine.\r\n\r\nART EXPRESSION.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"What is the highest degree of expression that art can delineate?\" said\r\nPiombino. \"Sleep,\" replied the master, to the surprise of all present, not\r\nexcepting Leonardo. \"I will explain,\" resumed Michael Angelo, \"lest you\r\nshould have misapprehended me. When I say that sleep is the highest\r\nexpression that artist can put into form, I mean that it is the last and\r\ncrowning effort of art; that it is the figure surmounting the pyramid on\r\nwhose sides are prefigured life's many phases--all passion, emotion,\r\nthought. And to elevate the idea to its highest limit, it is necessary to\r\ndepict it in youth--witness the Venus asleep--in order that man may feel\r\nhow turbulent a sea of life is calmed under its spell.\" \"But would not\r\ndeath itself express as much--a peace to the same passions, a peace more\r\nlasting?\" said Piombino. \"No,\" said Michael Angelo, \"the passions live in\r\nsleep; are growing; in death they are at an end; hence in sleep the eye is\r\nclosed to hide the naked forms of passion that lie within; in death the eye\r\nis open and sightless, a circumstance so effectually related in marble--a\r\nmaterial in which the open eye has a look of death united to\r\nimmortality.\"...\r\n\r\n\"But you have not told us,\" said Leonardo da Vinci, on observing that\r\nPiombino was satisfied, \"in what consists this long debated notion which we\r\ncall the fine ideal?\" \"By the fine ideal,\" said Michael Angelo. \"I presume\r\nwe both understand not the work of art itself, but the conception out of\r\nwhich it springs. Art is the exercise of an imitative faculty upon visible\r\nthings; but fine art is the transcendental idea entertained after the study\r\nof nature, and transferred from the mind itself to the canvas or marble.\"\r\n\"How is that idea acquired?\" asked Leonardo. \"The study of unsophisticated\r\nnature yields the ideal, or similitude of things seen; and this study,\r\nimpressing the recollection, affords in due time a conception of abstract\r\nbeauty itself to curious and sensitive minds.\" \"By what process can such\r\nconception be achieved?\" \"Alas! to make real progress in this enterprise\r\ndemands, on setting out, the possession of the finest faculties; powers so\r\ntranscendental as few are able to value. Such is, however, the prospect of\r\nall who deserve success in the highest departments of knowledge.\" \"Let us\r\nsuppose one to be thus endowed; what then?\" \"Well, let him go forth in a\r\ngenial mood and make himself master of the real; this done, he will have\r\nobserved the groupings of inanimate forms, and have learned nature's\r\nfailures and successes in giving features to the world. He will then ask\r\nwhat each feature would express, whether it be not something spiritual\r\nwhich lies deeper than the outer shape. Does the human face alone give\r\nutterance through its lineaments to thought and feeling? are not those of\r\nthe landscape also pregnant with meaning?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the Paris Journal des Debats.\r\n\r\nTHE MEETING OF THE VEGETARIANS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Vegetarians lately held a meeting in London, under the presidency of\r\nMr. Brotherton, M.P. There were about 400 persons present; as many women as\r\nmen; a great many children, and a great many Quakers; and as in that\r\ncountry people dine _a propos_ of everything, even when they only live on\r\nvegetables, there was a banquet of Vegetarians. We have no need to say that\r\nthe flesh of all kinds of animals was rigorously excluded; the bill of fare\r\nconsequently could be neither so brilliant nor so full of variety as those\r\nof Guildhall or the Hotel de Ville. These was only little pies of\r\nmushrooms, toasted bread and parsley, rice cakes, _blanc mange_, cheese\r\ntarts, and all sorts of pastry. The desert was composed of raspberries,\r\ncherries, and preserves; the whole washed down with tea, milk, coffee, and\r\niced water. After dinner there naturally came speeches. It is probable,\r\nfrom the bill of fare, that the speakers were in full possession of their\r\n_sang froid_; they have then no excuse for making, and it is not permitted\r\nfor any one to make, after such dinners, such speeches as they delivered.\r\nIf a speech be inevitable in an English banquet, there is also something\r\ninevitable in the speech, a quotation from the Bible. The Bible (we ask\r\npardon for the expression on account of the circumstance) is served up with\r\nall sorts of sauce. The President of the Vegetarians, then, relied on the\r\nverse in Genesis, in which it is said: \"And God said--Behold, I have given\r\nyou every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and\r\nevery tree in which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed: to you it shall\r\nbe for meat.\" That is very good, but something else is to be found in the\r\nBible; and if the Vegetarians quote to us the 29th verse of the first\r\nchapter of Genesis, we may answer them with the 28th, in which God, after\r\nhaving created man and woman, said: \"Be fruitful and multiply, and\r\nreplenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the\r\nsea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth\r\nupon the earth!\" So much for the theological part of the question; but\r\nthere remains the political part, that of economy and health. In a\r\npolitical point of view, the Vegetarians place their panacea above all\r\nothers; according to them, society will not be regenerated until all men\r\nshall live on parsley and tapioca: \"Passing in review,\" says the report,\r\n\"all the plans of social reform, the Peace Congress, popular education,\r\n&c.,\" the chairman expressed the opinion that none of these plans attack\r\nthe root of the evil, and that a reform in eating and drinking should\r\nprecede all others, \"For,\" said he, \"a man who, from conscientious motives,\r\nshall abstain from the slaughter of animals, will not be guilty of murder\r\nof his fellow creatures.\" As to the economic part of the question, the\r\nVegetarians are decided free-traders, decided partisans of direct exchange.\r\n\"It has been proved,\" said the chairman, \"that the nutritious quality of\r\nanimals is derived from vegetables, and, consequently, men take their good\r\nsecond-hand.\" The Vegetarians declare then for the abolition of\r\nintermediaries and for direct consumption. As for health, the advantages of\r\nthe vegetable system are presented to us under the most encouraging colors.\r\nThus, the East Indians, the porters of Cairo and Constantinople, and in\r\ngeneral a great part of the Orientals, never eat meat, and yet they are the\r\nfinest types of the human race. The Russians eat black wheat, the Scotch\r\noats, and they are very industrious laborers. To this it may be answered,\r\nthat if the Orientals eat little or no flesh, it is probably for them an\r\naffair of temperature as well as of temperament; that the conditions of\r\nhealth are not the same in all countries; that if the peasants of the North\r\ndo not eat meat, it is probably because they cannot get it; if the English\r\narmy were fed on rice, oats, and milk, instead of roast beef and beer, we\r\nshould be curious to know the results of the _regime_. But that does not\r\nprevent men from being in good health by indulging in an enormous\r\nconsumption of parsley; that herb is only fatal to parrots. The chairman of\r\nthe Vegetarians, Mr. Brotherton, is a living proof of it. For forty two\r\nyears he has followed the vegetable _regime_, and he affirms that it suits\r\nhim. There was also in the meeting an American, who came expressly all the\r\nway from Philadelphia, and who had belonged to the fraternity for forty\r\nyears. He declared that he enjoyed the best health, that he had five\r\nchildren, all well, that his children had married vegetarians, that he had\r\ntwenty-one grandchildren, who could never be made to taste meat. There is\r\nin the society _one_ member of parliament, and, we may perceive sometimes,\r\nthat the others do not live on raspberries and cream; there is a\r\nmagistrate, before whom there will be no necessity of appealing to Philip\r\nSober; there is an alderman, and we hope that he was not the other day at\r\nthe Hotel de Ville; there are 21 medical men, but they are there for the\r\nsake of experiment; there are ten members of the clergy, but that is not\r\nmany; there are ten literary men--alas! it is, perhaps, not their fault!\r\nAnd there are 50 lawyers, 26 merchants, 11 fundholders, 871 workmen--in all\r\n718, of whom 513 are men, and 205 female. We remember having seen at Paris\r\nan Englishman who made a very large fortune by selling pills entirely\r\ncomposed of extracts of vegetables. A caricature once represented his\r\npatients in full flower, that is covered with carrots, turnips, and\r\npotatoes, proving the success of the medicine. Perhaps we shall see it\r\nproved that it is forbidden to men to eat animals, and we do not despair of\r\nseeing it proved that it is permitted to animals to eat men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Authors and Books._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe magazine literature of Germany is quite different from ours, a fact\r\nwhich generally speaking is not to its discredit. Indeed there are several\r\nperiodicals in Germany which may be compared with the best English\r\nmagazines for their varied excellence, while their cost is comparatively\r\ntrifling. Among these are the _Deutsche Monatschrift_, a republican\r\nmonthly, edited by ADOLF KOLATSCHECK, and published at Stuttgart; and the\r\n_Grenzboten_, a weekly, of conservative and constitutional opinions, edited\r\nby GUSTAV FREYTAG, and JULIAN SCHMIDT, and published at Leipzig. The\r\nAmerican reader of these two periodicals, will have an excellent\r\napprehension of the general scope and tendencies of current thought in\r\nGermany, as well as some knowledge of the new books as they make their\r\nappearance. Those who wish a convenient and cheap mode of becoming\r\nacquainted with the productions of German novelists, may find it in the\r\n_Illustrirtes Familienbuch_, (Illustrated Family Book), published monthly\r\nat Treves. This is mainly made up of romances by the best writers of the\r\nday; there is also a department for artistic criticism, but it is not very\r\ngood. The engravings are tolerable.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGerman Poets are prolific just now. Mr. HOPPL has brought out a volume at\r\nStuttgart, full of suppressed tears and melancholy miseries. He is unloved\r\nand unappreciated, and must, therefore, have a bad time in this dreary and\r\nwoeful world. Of a similar strain is the second edition of CARL AUGUST\r\nLEBRET'S _Gedichte_, likewise published at Stuttgart; if anything he is\r\nmore pitiable and stupid than Hoppl. ADOLPH GLASSBRENNER, of Berlin, serves\r\nup poems of another sort, in his freshly printed third edition. He is known\r\nto every reader of current German literature as a comic writer of no small\r\nability, and these poems prove his talent. They are mostly political in\r\ntheir tendency, and are good of their kind. _Dunkles Laub_ (Dark Leaves) is\r\na youthful poem of Mr. _Frederik Ruperti_, published at Bremen. It recounts\r\nthe awful experiences, and spiritual and other struggles of the author's\r\nyouth. He suffers especially from an unhappy passion, and is apparently\r\nconvinced that the man never lived who endured so much. Still, he shows\r\ngreat poetic ability, and now that his youth is disposed of something may\r\nbe hoped from him.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFREILIGRATH, the German poet, is the subject of a searching, yet mildly\r\nexpressed criticism, in that excellent periodical, the _Grenzboten_, of\r\nLeipzig. The writer finds that he is superficial in feeling, without a\r\ngenuine sense of poetic melody, and not remarkable for mental power.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA tenth edition of BROCKHAUS'S _Conversations-Lexicon_ is now passing\r\nthrough the press. The first edition was published in 1796. Of the fifth\r\nedition, which appeared in 1818, 32,000 copies were sold; of the seventh\r\n(1826) 27,000; of the eighth (1832) 31,000; of the ninth (1843) 30,000. The\r\nsupplementary works issued between the editions, and devoted to current\r\nmatters, have also had a large sale. Of _the Conversations-Lexicon der\r\nNeuesten Zeit und Literatur_, (4 vols. 1832-34) 27,000 copies were sold; of\r\nthe _Conversations-Lexicon der Gegenwart_ (4 vols. 1838-1841) 18,000; and\r\nthe _Gegenwart_ which is now appearing is also sold largely. The new\r\nedition promises to be written in the same spirit of moderation and\r\nliberalism as its predecessors, but if the articles of the _Gegenwart_\r\nafford an indication, it will be more \"progressive\" and radical, and less\r\ncareful to satisfy all parties.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAn excellent German critic says of the preface to LAMARTINE'S _History of\r\nthe Restoration_, that it is as coquettish as everything in the historic\r\nway that has come from Lamartine's pen of late years. He coquets with the\r\nconflict of his own understanding and sentiments. His heart still beats for\r\nthe ancient dynasty; his mind decides for the republic--a very serious\r\nstate of things, not only for a statesman, who is called to share in the\r\nimmediate development of affairs, and who can never arrive at unity of\r\naction, as long as feeling and reflection impel him to different courses,\r\nbut also for the historian. Lamartine, says the writer, is a remarkable\r\nexample of that mixture which is often found among the French, of fantastic\r\nsentimentality, and frivolous, superficial reflection. He is especially\r\nremarkable, because he has converted this mixture, of which in most cases,\r\nthe person is unconscious, into a sort of system, and justifies it\r\naccordingly. The understanding says Yes, the heart says No, but both speak\r\nvivaciously and clearly, showing that he has them both in a high degree.\r\nThis consoles him for the want of harmony between the two; he never thinks\r\nthat in such harmony the reality of both consists.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nROBERT PRUTZ, the well-known German historian, has just made his appearance\r\nas a novelist with a romance in three parts, called _Das Engelchen_ (The\r\nLittle Angel). A large portion of it has been previously published in the\r\n_Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung_, where it has excited a profound interest.\r\nFrom the author's previous achievements as a lyric and dramatic poet, his\r\nsuccess in this new sphere is only what was to be expected. The Little\r\nAngel is a novel of modern society.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Zwrei Monate in Paris_ (Two Months in Paris), by ADOLPHE STAHR, is\r\npublished by Schulze in Oldenburg. Lest our readers should infer from the\r\nname of the author that this is a political work of solid character, we\r\nsubjoin the following remark by a German reviewer, \"Written in a light,\r\neasy, careless vein, this work helps to augment the already colossal pile\r\nof books relating to Paris, but is by no means such as we should have\r\nexpected from the representative of the Prussian revolution. Nay, it has\r\nbeen already surpassed by two recent and similar productions--the one by a\r\nlady, a little art-criticism, a little literature, a few theatrical items,\r\na _bal mabille_, a visit to Heine, and the sketch of a meeting of workmen,\r\nwith their songs, all written in that tolerably piquant, lively style, with\r\nwhich we have however of late been surfeited, form a book, agreeable\r\nenough, it is true, but not such as we should, in these earnest, serious\r\ntimes, have expected from such a writer.\" The American reader may however\r\ndraw a very different conclusion from that of this \"earnest and serious\r\nreviewer.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe last lesson usually taken by the student of ancient art is that in\r\ngems--cameos, intaglios, and the like--a fact the more surprising since\r\nnine-tenths of the spirit of classic life and beauty is thus extant in\r\nminiature. The Venus di Medicis and the Apollo Belvidere, the Parthenon and\r\nthe Temple of the Winds--every variety of mosaic, and half-obliterated\r\nscrap of fresco are familiar to the dilettante, ere he reflects over the\r\nincredible grace, beauty, and spirit displayed in the exquisite design of\r\nnearly every classic gem. Those, however, who have learned to appreciate\r\nthis department of ancient art, will welcome the appearance of KOHLER'S\r\n_Gesammelte Schriften_, (and the collected essays of H. K. E. KOHLER),\r\nforming the best work known on this subject. In it we find, treated in a\r\nmasterly manner, all the intricate methods of judging of ancient gems with\r\nmodern inscriptions, gems of an uncertain era, and modern imitations of\r\nancient cutting. The \"darker side\" of the work consists of violent and\r\nunmerited attacks on rival writers. Published by Leopold Vossin, Leipzig.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmong the cheapest and most attractive books for children which we have met\r\nwith are the recently published _Munich Bilderbuecher_, or picture-books,\r\nconsisting of thin folios of all manner of neatly-designed fancies, many of\r\nthem by eminent artists. They contain fairy tales, humorous sketches,\r\nhistorical illustrations, and a vast number of pictures in the well-known\r\n_Slovenly Peter_ style, but far more attractive. Many are colored, and the\r\npublisher has judiciously printed a number on thick, parchment-like paper,\r\nwell adapted to withstand the wear and tear of the nursery.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBooks are no longer written in Latin. For literature and learning that good\r\nold language has finally given way, in almost every country, during the\r\npresent century. In the United States there have been produced some fifty\r\nvolumes in Latin since the Revolution, nearly all of which are by\r\nforeigners. The Life of Washington, by Francis Glass, a western\r\nschoolmaster, is the most considerable contribution to Latin literature by\r\na native American. In Europe only a few pedantic churchmen continue to\r\nwrite to dead nations, and it is perhaps well enough that they should do\r\nso, since scarce any of them have fit thoughts for the living age, or for\r\ntongues that have been used by free and thinking men. We find an exception\r\nto the prevailing law in _De Caroli Timothei Zumptii Vita et Studiis\r\nNarratio August. Wilh. Zumptii_. Every body is familiar with the name of\r\nZumpt as that of one of the most learned Latinists of the last half\r\ncentury, and it is appropriate that his life should be written in a\r\nlanguage to the study and illustration of which it was almost entirely\r\ndevoted. The Lives of Hemsterhuys by Ruhnken, of Ruhnken by Wyttenbach, and\r\nof Wyttenbach by Mahne, have long been the delight of scholars, and have\r\nfurnished some of the best specimens of modern Latinity. Zumpt will not\r\ntake rank among philologers with these great lights of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, but he rendered services to learning which will deserve a\r\nmemorial, and in moral qualities he was not inferior to any of them. He\r\nbecame in succession a teacher in other Gymnasia in Berlin, and ultimately\r\nProfessor of History in the Military College, and of Latin Eloquence in the\r\nUniversity. He published the first edition of his celebrated _Grammar_ in\r\n1818, and it soon became known throughout the civilized world. Of his other\r\npublications the most considerate is his edition of the _Verrine Orations\r\nof Cicero_; his _Dissertations on the Population of the Ancient World, De\r\nLegibus Judiciisque Repetundarum_, and several others, show that he was\r\nwell versed in antiquities, but grammar, criticism, and style were his\r\nproper field. Wolf pronounced himself and Zumpt the only men in Berlin who\r\ncould write Latin. His incessant labors undermined his constitution, and\r\nbrought on a premature decay; and for some time before his death he had\r\nbecome entirely blind. He died at Carlsbad in 1849.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA third edition of THIBAUT'S well-known work, _Uber Reinheit der Tonkunst_,\r\nwith a preface by the Minister R. Bahr, and a portrait of Palestrina, has\r\njust made its appearance, from the establishment of the well-known\r\npublisher Mohr, of Heidelberg.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA new course of _Proces Celebres_ is to be published by Brockhaus, of\r\nLeipsic.

Enturckelung der Wirbelthiere_, Berlin,\r\n1851. All who are interested in theories of the development of organic life\r\nwill welcome the appearance of this work, which has been received with\r\ncordial approbation by the most eminent German physiologists. This second\r\nvolume is devoted to the development of \"the chicken in the egg,\" and is\r\nillustrated with seven admirable copper-plates. Notwithstanding the\r\nresearches of Everard Horne, Ratke, and others into this department, this\r\nwork of Remak's is distinguished by an even more accurate and detailed\r\nexamination of phenomena, and it may confidently be classed among the first\r\nof the age. This is the opinion of _The Centralblatt_. The engravings are\r\nby Haase. This Robert Remak is the brother of Gustav Remak, an eminent\r\nGerman lawyer in Philadelphia.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the _Archives for the Study of Modern Languages and Literature_ we\r\nobserve a paper by one G. JAP, entitled, _Why does the English Language, in\r\nits acquisition and combination of new words, rather incline to the classic\r\ntongues than the copious and flexible German element?_ To which we may\r\nanswer, \"Alas, _why_, indeed?\" Why is not the study of the Saxon Testament\r\ngenerally introduced? and why are not school-boys familiarized with the\r\nolder forms of our own language--as they are in Germany made to study the\r\nNeibelungen Lied, and Wackernagel's Reader? We can imagine no argument in\r\nfavor of a study of Greek which might not be with equal force applied to\r\nSaxon and good _old_ English.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA work has recently appeared in Breslan bearing the title, _The Higher\r\nClasses, as they are, and as they should be_, by Count ARNIM BLUMBERG:\r\n_written in the month of February, 1851_. That the aristocracy of Germany\r\nat the present day are far from being the practical philanthropists which\r\nthey should be is beyond a doubt, but that they will become such by\r\ninspiring them with piety, in the unfortunate, melancholy sense in which\r\nthat word is generally taken at the present day on the continent, is still\r\nmore doubtful. _Not slothful in business, fervent in spirit, serving the\r\nLord_, is piety in America--something contrasting remarkably with the\r\nmystical and world-renouncing _pietismus_ of modern Germany.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA second \"completely renewed and greatly increased\" edition of BERTHOLD\r\nAUERBACH'S _Deutsche Abende_, or German Evenings, has been published by\r\nBassorman, of Mannheim. Auerbach is in this country rapidly attaining the\r\npopularity which was held a few years since by Zschokke. Apropos of the\r\nlatter, we remark a neat and very cheap edition of all his works, now\r\npublishing by Sauerlaender, of Aarau.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne of the most important architectural works which has ever made its\r\nappearance is now being published by Meissner, of Hamburg, bearing the\r\ntitle _Denkmaler der Bankunst aller Zeiten und Lander_ (Monuments of the\r\nArchitecture of every Era and Country), by JULES GAILHABAND, and published\r\nfor Germany under care and contribution of Dr. Franz Kugler. The literary\r\nand artistic excellence of the original work is too well known to render\r\ndescription necessary, and its improvement is guaranteed from its being\r\nunder the care of Kugler, who is perhaps better qualified, aesthetically,\r\nfor such a task, than any German, or indeed any one living. The 197 and 198\r\n_livraisons_ which now appear, contain engravings of the Chateau Chambord\r\nin France, the Mosque of Hassan in Cairo, the Temple of Gerschen in Nubia,\r\nthe Baths of Caracalla, sketches of bridges of the middle ages, the Palace\r\nof Strozzi, and many others. In connection with this we may mention the\r\n_Entwurfez Land-und. Stadt Gebauden_, or Sketches for Domestic Architecture\r\nby F. W. HOLZ, a work which may be commended as _suggestive_ rather than\r\npractical, but still on that very account to be commended to young\r\narchitects desirous of developing their creative powers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWithout wishing to render aught save honor to all who diligently pursue the\r\nminutest departments of science, we are still at times reminded, by\r\noccasional works, of the professor who was honored as one inspired by \"a\r\nfull German blood and a Fatherland's spirit,\" for a book--the result of\r\nthirty years' unwearied application--on bigamy and polygamy among\r\ngrasshoppers. We are irresistibly reminded of this anecdote by a\r\n\"preliminary notice\" of some thirty odd years' observations of \"certain\r\nvarieties of thrushes,\" which are shortly to appear in an ornithological\r\nmagazine at Stuttgart.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmong a mass of Lutheran Church literature recently published in Germany,\r\nwe observe VOGEL ERNST GUST'S _Bibliotheca Biographica Lutherana, Ubersicht\r\nder zedruckten Dr. Martin Luther betreffenden biograph. Schriften, id est_,\r\n(Gustavus Ernst Vogel's Biographical Lutheran Library: a notice of all the\r\nprinted works extant referring to the life of Dr. Martin Luther.) This work\r\nwill be found extremely interesting to all readers of the History of the\r\nReformation, since it embraces notices of many important works which might\r\notherwise escape attention.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA work interesting to those who like to follow out the different political\r\ntrains of thought developed in these \"working\" times, has recently been\r\npublished by Rumpfer of Hanover, bearing the title. _The Excellence of a\r\nConstitutional Monarchy for England, and its inapplicability to the other\r\ncountries of Europe_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe German critics notice an increased interest in what relates to Art and\r\nLiterature in the Middle Ages. Among other singular but interesting works,\r\nwe observe the commencement of a series of \"Manufacturing or Trade\r\nChronicles\" of that time, containing \"researches into the mediaeval sources\r\nand archives of many German cities, and consisting of items never before\r\nprinted,\" published at St. Gall, in Switzerland, by Scheitlin and\r\nZollikoffer. As Switzerland is eminently the country wherein the ancient\r\n_guilds_, or business associations of the Middle Ages, have longest\r\ncontinued in their original form, we may remark a peculiar appropriateness\r\nin the fact that such a work should there make its first appearance. This\r\nvolume consists of _The Chronicles of the honorable Association of\r\nButchers_. Also, the publication of a manuscript, _Thetmari magistri, iter\r\nad Terram Sanctum_, 1217, (Thetmar's Journey to the Holy Land, in 1217,) by\r\nHuber & Co., of St. Gall: edited by T. TOBLER. With which we would cite\r\n_Koninc Ermenrikes Duet_. The death of King Ermenrich, an old Flemish Song\r\nand Legend of Theodoric, discovered with notes, by Jac. Grimm, Hanover:\r\npub. by Ehlerman, price 15s. groschen. This work, which we have as yet not\r\nseen, has, however, been spoken of in terms of high praise, as \"although in\r\nmany places wanting, still excellent, as giving yet another glance into the\r\nrich vein of German Legendary, and Lyrical Life.\" Fault is, however, found\r\nwith the publisher for a want of precision and accuracy. CONRAD SCHWENCK\r\npublishes through SAUNERLANDER, a \"_Mythology of the Ancient German_\" while\r\nthe \"_Origin of the three oldest cities on the Rhine_,\" namely, Mayence,\r\nBonn, and Cologne, by Franz Ritter, is not without claims to interest.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne of the most exquisite artistic literary productions which has for years\r\nappeared in Germany, is that which has lately been published by RUDOLPH\r\nBESSER, of Hamburg, bearing the title, _Dr. Martin Luther, der Deutsche\r\nReformator: In bildlichen Darstellunzen von Gustav Koenig; in\r\ngeschichtlichen Umrissen von Heinrich Gelzer_. (Dr. Martin Luther, the\r\nGerman reformer: artistically illustrated by Gustavus Koenig, with\r\nhistorical sketches, by Henry Gelzer.) This is one of the works of which\r\nProtestant Germany may well feel proud, inasmuch as it has in every line\r\nthe impress and spirit of national art. The entire work sets forth the\r\nartistic feeling which characterized the Nuremberg artists of the sixteenth\r\ncentury, and we are continually and irresistibly reminded, in turning over\r\nthese exquisite engravings, of Albert Duerer, Cranach Wohlgemuth and Hans\r\nSebald Beham. The work consists in a great part of short sketches and\r\nscenes from the life of Luther, illustrated, as the title implies, by the\r\neminent artist Koenig, who, though an artist of Munich, is by birth a\r\nCoburger. From Munich he has, however, drawn all the learning and\r\ninspiration of the middle age and high Catholic art, the which knowledge he\r\nhas however admirably and consistently applied to an eminently Protestant\r\nsubject. Peculiarly in the modernised Duerer style, is one of the first\r\nengravings representing Luther as a boy singing for bread, (as is even yet\r\nthe custom in some parts of Germany,) before the door of a house. Luther\r\ngives himself a naive account of this: \"They say, (quoth Luther,) and\r\ntruly, that the Pope himself hath been in his time a wandering student,\r\ntherefore let us not despise the lads who beg before the doors '_panem\r\npropter Deum_', and sing for bread. Such an one have I also been, and\r\nreceived bread before the doors of houses, particularly at Eisenach, in\r\nmine own dear town.\" Very animated and expressive is also the scene\r\nrepresenting Luther as accidentally coming upon a copy of the Bible for the\r\nfirst time in the University Library. In his left hand he holds a massy\r\nfolio Aristotle, and near him lie tomes of scholastic philosophy and\r\ntheology, while his eye with the rapid glance of intelligence and\r\nconviction peruses the history of _Anna_. This is in short a work which\r\nevery patron of art will certainly obtain, nor will it prove less\r\nacceptable to the scholar and theologian from the graphic and excellent\r\ncharacter of the literary matter.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Deutsches Volkskalender auf das Jahr_, 1852. _Herausg, von Gustav.\r\nNientz._ There are two works, which, generally speaking, are found in every\r\nChristian family--the Bible and--the almanac. The Almanac has in fact the\r\ngreater antiquity of the twain, for in the remote East, as in Norway, it\r\nwas universally published \"for the million,\" on blocks of wood or stone, or\r\non walking-canes, even in the days of paganism. And since it _is_ so\r\ngenerally distributed, would it not be well for some of our higher literati\r\nto take the matter in hand, and make it a medium for something better than\r\ncriminal trials, quack advertisements, and similar subjects? This of\r\nNieritz is well gotten up, and contains excellent contributions from Jer.\r\nGotthelf, Karl Barth, A. Wildenhahn, Karl Simrock, and A. Grube. The best\r\nin the collection appears to be _The Broom-maker of Rychiswyl_, by\r\nGotthelf. All of the engravings are admirable, and the work is published\r\nfor \"next to nothing.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAn _Austrian Biographical Dictionary_ is now publishing, by Moritz Bermann,\r\nat Vienna; useful to students of history and politics.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn SWEDEN, is the title of two volumes of _Sketches of Travel_, by HANS\r\nCHRISTIAN ANDERSEN, just published at Leipzic. They are replete with all\r\nthe poetic charm and genial humor which his pen imparts to every subject it\r\ntouches.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHENRICH ZEISE is a Danish novelist with whose works we have in this country\r\nno acquaintance, but who has just been introduced to the Germans by a\r\ntranslation into their language of his _Novels of Christian Winther_, which\r\nare praised by the critics as not only well written, but as affording an\r\nexcellent idea of Danish social life. Zeise is the son of a country parson\r\nof Lolland; was born in 1796; and first distinguished himself by his\r\nfugitive poems, which in 1820 were collected in a volume. He travelled in\r\nGermany, Switzerland, and Italy, and in 1832 published a collection of\r\ntranslations from the German poets and other writers. In 1835, he brought\r\nout a second series of his own poems, in which he abandoned to a great\r\ndegree his previous popular style, and put on the manners of fashionable\r\nsociety. This was not a successful experiment. His novels are more recent;\r\nthe best, _Osterie_, was published in 1843. In 1849 he translated _Reinecke\r\nFuchs_ into Danish, preserving the original metre. He now has a pension\r\nfrom government, and lives at Copenhagen.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTEGNER, the great Swedish poet, is known to American and English readers\r\nthrough _Frithiof's Saga_ and Longfellow's translations of his _Children of\r\nthe Lord's Supper_. A German version of his more recent writings is now\r\nmaking its appearance at Leipzic. The first number contains _Gerda_, a\r\nfragment of an unfinished heroic poem which is spoken of as very admirable,\r\nand a few little comic poems which are said to be charming. Adam and Eve\r\nfigure in one of these.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHEINRICH VON ORTENBURG has published a second edition of his poetical tale,\r\nentitled _Nachtbluthen_--Night-blooms, or Night-flowers--and JOHN G. SEIDE,\r\nthe Viennese, an increased edition of _The Songs of the Night_. The two\r\nwill serve to bind up with _Voices of the Night_--though perhaps there\r\n_are_ German or Sclavonic poems that would better serve this purpose.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Bomische Rosen, Czechische Volkslieder_ (Bohemian Roses, or National\r\nSongs), by IDA VON DURINGSFELD, and published by Kern, of Breslau, will\r\nundoubtedly attract the attention of the rapidly increasing circle of\r\nfriends of Sclavonic literature. Also Sketches of Travel, by the same\r\nauthoress, published by Schlodtmann, of Bremen.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAn edition of _Hoffman von Fallersleben's Heimatklange_, or Regrets for\r\nHome, a collection of songs, has just made its appearance. Apropos of\r\nultra-liberal political bards, we see that FRELIGRATH publishes the second\r\nvolume of _Neuere Polit und Sociale Gedichte_, or Recent Political and\r\nSocial Poems, by Schaub, of Duesseldorf. Freligrath's reputation as a poet\r\nappears to have much advantage from his persecution as a patriot.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Italians were surprised lately by the announcement that the ex-minister\r\nGUERRAZZI, who is in prison awaiting trial for high treason, was about to\r\npublish _An Apology for his Political Life_, and that sheets of this\r\nApology are from time to time forwarded to Signor Lami, Minister of Greece\r\nand Justice, who revises them, when they are returned to Guerrazzi for\r\nfinal correction. It seems incredible--altogether inconsistent with Italian\r\npolicy--that a state prisoner should thus be suffered to pre-occupy the\r\npublic mind with his defence. But the ministerial paper of the 8th of\r\nAugust indiscreetly solved the mystery with the following notice:\r\n\r\n     \"The publisher, Lemonnier, at Florence, is now printing, and\r\n     will shortly publish a thick volume, containing 'The Apology\r\n     for the Political Life of Guerrazzi,' written by himself.\r\n     The announcement of this publication, is of a nature to\r\n     excite great curiosity; it will at the same time be a\r\n     thunderbolt to the Neo-Moderati, and the most conclusive\r\n     condemnation of their acts during the period Guerrazzi was\r\n     in power. Guerrazzi therein unpitifully and ably scourges\r\n     their political weaknesses, and their _portefeuille_\r\n     rivalries, which obliged the Grand Duke in the end to throw\r\n     himself into the arms of the democratic party. This book of\r\n     Guerrazzi's will be a peremptory reply to the\r\n     proudly-compiled apology of the Italian Constitutional\r\n     party, published by Messrs. Gualterio and Farini, and\r\n     especially to the base and calumnious imputations, directed\r\n     by the latter against our excellent and loyal Grand Duke, in\r\n     the recently published third volume of his work. Not only\r\n     will the Constitutionalists be denounced in the book of\r\n     Guerrazzi, but the intrigues of the Piedmontese Government\r\n     with regard to Tuscany will be exposed, as likewise those of\r\n     Sir G. Hamilton, British ambassador at Florence.\"\r\n\r\nThis certifies the publication to be a bargain between Guerrazzi and the\r\nTuscan Ministry to give vent to their hatred of the Constitutional party\r\nand of Piedmont. Guerrazzi writes in prison, from prison sends to the\r\nprinters, and the Minister acts as reviser. It is really an odd thing--but\r\ncharacteristic of Italian affairs, perhaps,--for a disgraced and impeached\r\nminister to buy his life by turning \"States' Evidence.\" In better days such\r\nresults were for rascals of a lower grade.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nF. A. GUALTERIO brings out an account of the late Italian\r\nrevolution--_Gliultimi Rivolgimenti Italiani, Memorie Storiche, con\r\nDocumenti inediti_--the first part of which, in three large octavo volumes,\r\nonly comes down to the accession of Pius IX. to the Pontificate. The work\r\nis published in Florence, and has made considerable sensation, especially\r\nin Tuscany and Piedmont. The publications on the subject that appear in\r\nItaly are of course all on one side. The other side is represented by a\r\nparty, or by several parties, who are in exile, and the number of books\r\npublished on Italy and Italian affairs, in London and in Paris, is very\r\ngreat: more than a hundred during the last year.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn Berlin we observe that Sigismund Wiese, the author of two pious plays,\r\nentitled respectively _Moses_ and _Jesus of Nazareth_, has put forth\r\nanother pair of similar dramatic productions, bearing the names of the\r\n_Apostle Peter_, and _The Apostle Paul_. Whether this be a retrograde\r\nmovement toward the ancient Bible mysteries of the middle ages, or whether\r\nthe theatre in Berlin (as we should infer from certain recent curious works\r\nand movements) is actually undergoing a spiritual renovation, we have not\r\nas yet ascertained.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA work called _Essai de Socialisme Rationnel_, by M. COLINS, has appeared\r\nat Paris, where it is exciting some attention. It is dedicated to Emile de\r\nGirardin, though in the dedication the author declares his complete dissent\r\nfrom the doctrines of that eminent journalist. M. Anatole Leroy is\r\nreviewing it in a series of articles in _La Presse_. The motto of M. Colins\r\nis this: \"What I understand by socialism is the abolition of all pauperism,\r\nwhether moral relating to knowledge, or material relating to riches. I\r\naffirm that this socialism has become necessary to order, and that it can\r\nbe established without disorder.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPleasant reading is there in the _Memoires Pittoresques d'un Officier de\r\nMarine_, just published at Paris in two handsome octavos, with the name of\r\nCaptain F. LACONTE as their author. The French in general are not great\r\ntravellers, but the best narrators in the world. Our Captain adds to the\r\nreputation of his people in both respects. He tells the story of his\r\nadventures and experiences in out-of-the-way parts of the world with a\r\ngayety and _laissez-aller_ which charm the reader. For the rest, what he\r\nsaw in the South Sea, in Russia, in Turkey, at Madagascar, was well worth\r\nthe telling in such a style. When he prints another book we hope to hear of\r\nit.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA book which our students of belles-lettres should have is M. de la\r\nVILLEMARQUE'S _Poemes des Bardes Bretons du VIe Siecle_. It is an\r\nexcellent proof of the thorough study now devoted to the early popular\r\nliterature of France, whose richness, by the way, is not much suspected by\r\nthe elegant scholars of other countries. M. de la Villemarque has treated\r\nhis subject with equal conscientiousness and affection. He gives abundant\r\nspecimens of the songs of the bards in the form of translations from the\r\noriginal Celtic into French. The work is concluded by some philological\r\ndisquisitions of value to whoever wishes to study the Celtic tongue.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nM. PERRYMOND, one of the most intelligent and learned staticians of France,\r\nhas published a reply to Thiers's Report on Paupers and Public Charity: the\r\ntitle of PERRYMOND'S work is _Le Pain du Proletaire, ou le Commerce des\r\nPeuples_. It is socialistic.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe political and social theory of Mazzini, and especially his doctrine\r\nthat the idea of duty, with the utter subjection of the individual to the\r\ngeneral interest, is the sole base for society and government, is the\r\nsubject of some vigorous and unmerciful essays in the _Journal des Debats_,\r\nby Alexandre Thomas.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA late number of the _Revue des Deux Mondes_, has an article by M.\r\nTAILLANDIER, on the Swiss popular poets, in which they are duly praised,\r\nand considerable extracts given from their writings. M. Taillandier thinks,\r\nhowever, that Switzerland is in serious danger of moral and mental\r\ncorruption from the inroads of the Hegelian philosophy.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThose who wish in the briefest space to get an idea of the philosophical\r\nsystem of AUGUSTE COMTE, will find a valuable aid in some articles by M.\r\nROMAIN CORNUT, now published in _La Presse_. M. Cornut proposes to give a\r\nsuccinct yet complete summary of all the teachings of the great Positivist.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA work has just begun to appear at Paris, which must excite the attention\r\nof every student of history, and claim a place in every library that\r\npretends to any degree of completeness. It is a collection of the speeches\r\nand parliamentary reports of the principal French orators from 1789 to the\r\npresent day. The first volume is published containing the speeches of\r\nMIRABEAU, with a biography and a great variety of critical notices of the\r\ngreat revolutionist and his career. The speeches of Robespierre will appear\r\npromptly, as well as those of Bussot, Vergniaud, Danton, Maury, Cazalles,\r\n&c. The price is seven francs the volume.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe have mentioned with the praise which we believe it deserved, the\r\n_History of the Protestants of France_, by G. S. FELICE, lately published\r\nby Mr. Walker. This work was simultaneously translated, by the author of\r\nMr. Walker's version, and by a very accomplished woman whose labors that\r\nversion made profitless. On the same subject we have from Lea & Blanchard,\r\nof Philadelphia, in two volumes, a _History of the Protestant Reformation\r\nin France_, by Mrs. MARSH, the authoress of \"Emily Wyndham,\" &c. This work\r\nwill be popular. Several years ago we read a _History of the Reformed\r\nReligion in France_, by Mr. SMEDLEY, published by the Harpers, who still,\r\nwe believe, have it on their trade lists. It is quite as eloquently\r\nwritten, as dramatic, and in all respects as able as either of the others;\r\nand any of the three may be commended as not less engrossing than the last\r\nnew novel.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe library of the poet Gray, which had been kept together in the family of\r\nWilliam Penn, was at length scattered by a sale at auction, in London, on\r\nthe 26th of August.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen M. GUIZOT, many years ago, published his \"Collection of Memoirs\r\nrelating to the History of the Revolution in England,\" in twenty-seven\r\nvolumes, he added to that great work biographical sketches of the various\r\nauthors whose works he had translated. Those biographical studies,\r\ncarefully revised and corrected, with some that he had contributed to\r\ndictionaries, and others entirely new, are now collected into a volume of\r\n_Bohn's Library_ (New-York, Bangs & Brother), and, with the memoirs of\r\nGeneral Monk, constitute a sort of gallery of portraits, in which\r\npersonages of the most different characters appear in contrast--chiefs or\r\nchampions of sects or parties, Parliamentarians, Cavaliers, Republicans,\r\nand Levellers, who, either at the termination of the political conflicts in\r\nwhich they were engaged, or when in retirement towards the close of their\r\nlives, described themselves, their own times, and the parts they played\r\ntherein. M. Guizot has written the History of the English Revolution in\r\nthese lives of the Revolutionists; for _all_ parties were revolutionary in\r\nthose days--the Cavaliers by their denial of right no less than the\r\nParliamentarians by their assertion of it. The studies are of Denzil\r\nHollis, Edmund Ludlow, Thomas May, Sir P. Warwick, John Lilburne, Fairfax,\r\nMr. Hutchinson, Sir Thomas Herbert, John Price, Lord Clarendon, Burnet, the\r\nDuke of Buckingham, Sir John Reresby, with notices of the _Eikon Basilike_,\r\n&c, and Memoirs of James II.--a sufficient variety to enable the author to\r\nexhibit all the facettes of the diamond.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt the distribution of prizes awarded to pupils in the various colleges of\r\nParis, three or four weeks ago, the new Superior Council of Public\r\nInstruction, including MM. Thenard, Giraud, Daniel-Poinsot, and Ortila,\r\nattended officially at the Sorbornne: they were placed behind the Minister\r\nof Public Instruction, beside whom were M. Portalis, President of the Court\r\nof Cassation, and M. Saint-Marc Girardin, Secretary of the Council. The\r\nother members of the Council who assisted the Minister were M. Dupin,\r\nPresident of the National Assembly; M. Laplagne-Barras, wearing the\r\nmagnificent dress of the superior officers of the Court of Cassation;\r\nCardinal Gousset, seated, wearing the scarlet robe and hat of his office,\r\n&c. But the real hero of the solemnity was GUIZOT, who, on his entrance\r\ninto the hall to resume his ancient place among the professors, was greeted\r\nwith loud acclamations and the most respectful salutations, which were\r\nrepeated still more warmly when the name of his son, William Guizot, was\r\npronounced as of one of the prizemen.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA new novel, in two volumes, by EUGENE SUE, with the title of _Miss Mary;_\r\na tale by HENRI MURGER, called _Claude et Marianne_; and volumes iv. and v.\r\nof _Ange Pitou_, by ALEXANDER DUMAS, have just appeared in Paris.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe witty feuilletoniste, JULES JANIN, has published in a volume the\r\nletters he wrote from London during the Great Exhibition to the _Journal\r\ndes Debats_. J. J., as everybody knows, is the most delightful journalist\r\nof art and society in the world, and all Paris anticipates the articles\r\nunder his signature as a principal part of each day's satisfaction. Apropos\r\nof this new book of his, the London _Morning Chronicle_ says, \"From the\r\nfirst line to the last, he has rioted in his own peculiar style--laughed,\r\ncried, sung, danced, in the same, and almost in every breath--jumped about\r\nin one page like a kitten catching its tail--and struck himself into an\r\nawful attitude of moral meditation, with an aspect as wise as Aristotle's,\r\nin the next--accomplishing all these literary feats by a most miraculous\r\noutpouring of words--capital words, fanciful, witty, fantastic, scholarly\r\nwords--and jumbled, tossed, piled up on each others' backs--jerked this way\r\nand that--sharpened one against the other, glittering and gleaming, one by\r\nthe aid of another--a perfect firework of words, Roman-candle sentences,\r\nand Catherine-wheel periods--rockets of epithets, and girandoles of\r\nantitheses!\" But yet Janin's self-respect would not allow him to say that,\r\nin some instances, he has \"sacrificed thought and sense, pith and\r\nshrewdness, to build up a barley-sugar temple of verbal prettiness, and to\r\ndeck and wreath it with artificial flowers of rhetoric and of phraseology,\r\nwhich for a moment may seem to have smell, and sap, and savor, but which,\r\nupon closer inspection, too often reveal themselves in their true, and dry,\r\nand dreary substance of wire, and gauze, and calico.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne M. LEON DE MONTBEILLARD has published a work on SPINOZA. If that\r\nPhilosopher has one characteristic more eminent than another, it is\r\ncommonly supposed to be the precision and exactness of his logic. To say\r\nthat Spinoza was a rigorous logician is a platitude, a truism. M.\r\nMontbeillard declines to walk in such a beaten path. He denies that Spinoza\r\nhas any skill whatever in the science of reason, that he is a mere\r\nrhapsodist!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nM.

We\r\ncopy from them a few paragraphs:\r\n\r\n     I had two hours delightful conversation with Mr. de Quincy,\r\n     at Lasswade, and was as deeply impressed with his\r\n     intellectual power in talking, as I was with his writing\r\n     when, in my boyhood, I read his \"Confessions of an English\r\n     Opium Eater.\"\r\n\r\n     On my return from visiting Kirk Alloway, and the cottage of\r\n     Burns, I called on his remaining sister, Mrs. Begg, a highly\r\n     intelligent woman of eighty, who gave me some information of\r\n     an important character, as I deem it to be. Her daughter,\r\n     Isabella, was present while I had the short conversation\r\n     with her. I told her that I entertained strong doubts of the\r\n     truth of many things which were said about her illustrious\r\n     brother, and I wished to have the benefit of her own\r\n     personal knowledge respecting him. She replied that she\r\n     would have pleasure in giving me all the information in her\r\n     power. I told her that a person in Glasgow had declared to\r\n     me, the other day, that he believed all the accounts of her\r\n     brother's irregular life; for a friend of his had called on\r\n     Mrs. Begg lately, and _she_ had said that she had often seen\r\n     her brother sit at the table in a morning, after a night's\r\n     debauch, shading his face with his hand, while the big tears\r\n     of remorse were dropping on the board before him. Mrs. Begg\r\n     seemed moved painfully. \"Nothing is more false,\" she\r\n     replied; \"I never had such a conversation; and never could\r\n     say so, for I never saw my brother either drunk, or showing\r\n     any such feeling; nor did I ever know him to be drunk. It is\r\n     true, I saw but little of him in the latter part of his\r\n     life; but his son, who was with him almost constantly, told\r\n     me that he never saw his father the worse for liquor but\r\n     once; and then he was sick, but yet perfectly conscious. His\r\n     son also said, that though his father would come home late\r\n     during the latter part of his life, when they lived in\r\n     Dumfries; yet he was always able to examine bolts and bars,\r\n     went to observe that the children were right in bed and\r\n     always acted like a sober man. Besides,\" added the\r\n     intelligent old lady, \"how was it possible that my brother\r\n     could be a drunkard, when he had so small an income, and\r\n     yet, a few weeks before his death, owed nobody a shilling?\r\n     That speaks for itself.\" Mrs. Begg furthermore confirmed\r\n     what I also learned in Glasgow from persons conversant with\r\n     those who had known every circumstance of the close of\r\n     Burns's life, that Allan Cunningham has sorely misstated\r\n     many matters. Burns did _not_ die in the dramatic style\r\n     which Allan tells of. Allan was never in Ayrshire in his\r\n     life; but had his materials from some old fellow who went\r\n     about poking into every corner and raking out every false\r\n     story about Burns. A writer in Glasgow, in whose company I\r\n     sat for a short time in the evening after I had delivered my\r\n     oration there on Burns, contradicted Allan Cunningham's\r\n     account of Burns's death, from personal knowledge--just at\r\n     the time when Allan's _Life of Burns_ appeared; but Allan\r\n     never took any notice of the pamphlet, and never corrected\r\n     the misstatement. Mrs. Begg said that she had seen the two\r\n     volumes of the new life of her brother, by Robert Chambers,\r\n     and the account was fairer than any she had seen before.\r\n\r\nThe name of the \"Baroness VON BECK\" has been familiar through the English\r\nreviews, during the last year or two, as the authoress of a book on the\r\nlate Hungarian war. This woman turns out to have been no baroness, not even\r\na \"friend\" of Kossuth, but a paid spy in the service of the National\r\nHungarian Government, and lately a paid spy in the \"recently established\r\nforeign branch of the English police force.\" She was on the thirtieth of\r\nAugust apprehended at Birmingham for obtaining money under false pretences,\r\nand died in the anteroom of the court, from a sudden affection of the\r\nheart, induced by the emotion caused by her detection. She had played a\r\nremarkable part. Her Memoirs were published by Bentley, and had a large\r\nsale, but they appear to have been written by another person. At the time\r\nof her arrest she was procuring subscriptions for a new volume descriptive\r\nof her pretended Adventures.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. THACKERAY is writing a novel in three volumes, to be published in the\r\nwinter. The scene is in England early in the eighteenth century, and among\r\nthe characters will be Bolingbroke, Swift, and Pope; and Steele will play a\r\nprominent part. Mr. Thackeray has concluded to publish no more \"serials,\"\r\nand we hope his new scenes and persons will suggest to him a little respect\r\nfor human nature, which hitherto he appears to have regarded as a mere\r\ntrick and imposture.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA pension of 200_l._ a year on the civil list has been conferred on Mr.\r\nSilk Buckingham. A pension of 200_l._ a year has also been given to Colonel\r\nTorrens, the author of several works on political economy. Mr. Buckingham\r\nhad just obtained 400_l._ a year, as we have before mentioned, from the\r\nEast India Company. It seems to us that these pensions can have but little\r\nto do with the \"encouragement of literature.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe venerable poet JAMES MONTGOMERY will be eighty years of age on the\r\nfifth of November, and the people of Sheffield are preparing suitable\r\nhonors for the occasion.

W. RIX, of Beccles, author\r\nof the Fauconberge Memorial.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJOHN STUART MILL, we are advised by letters from England, is hereafter to\r\nbe editor of the _Westminster Review_, which is now the grand organ of the\r\nsocialists and disorganizers of society.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe have from Mr. Hart, of Philadelphia, in two beautiful volumes, _Memoirs\r\nof the Life of Mary Queen of Scots_, by Miss BENGER. They are written with\r\nneatness, and could not fail of a dramatic interest. Indeed, we know of no\r\nmemoir of Mary Stuart, in the two or three dozen we have read with more or\r\nless attention, that is in all respects as attractive as Miss Benger's. But\r\nit seemed an unfortunate time to publish this, when the _History of Mary\r\nQueen of Scots_ by M. MIGNET, Perpetual Secretary of the Academy of Moral\r\nand Political Sciences, was advertised, and it was known that its character\r\nwould be such as necessarily to give it precedence of all other works on\r\nthe subject. We noticed the design of M. Mignet two or three months ago,\r\nand we have now before us a translation, published by Bentley, of London,\r\nof his first volume. It fully realizes our expectations, in evident candor,\r\nresearch, and ability. It owes its existence to Prince Labanoff's\r\ncollection of the queen's letters, and is the substance of a series of\r\npapers on that extraordinary work in the _Journal des Savants_. But M.\r\nMignet had obtained access to original documents (chiefly the dispatches of\r\nthe Spanish embassies in England, France, and Rome) which even Prince\r\nLabanoff had not explored, and has thus been able to give an original\r\ncharacter to his narrative. It is an excellent specimen of condensed yet\r\nclear historical writing. Leading incidents stand out boldly, and no\r\nessential facts are omitted, yet there is not an excess of details. Motives\r\nare discriminated, and doubtful questions cleared, while we are spared the\r\nfatigue of elaborate disquisition. The book is little more than a\r\nsketch--but it is a most valuable one. With more materials before him than\r\nany previous biographer, the author has had to contend with fewer\r\nprejudices of his own. He is neither the apologist, nor the traducer of his\r\nheroine. Neither as Catholic nor as Protestant, as Scotchman nor as\r\nEnglishman, does he sit in judgment on her history; he views the scenes of\r\nher career with an impartiality as far removed from harshness as from\r\nindulgence and may perhaps be pronounced her first unbiassed biographer. It\r\nis right at the same time to add that his historic coldness of temperament\r\ndoes not always enable him to judge quite fairly the difficulties under\r\nwhich both parties (but especially the Protestant party) labored at\r\nparticular times; and perhaps it stops short, now and then, of the\r\ncompassionate considerations which would best explain some points of Mary's\r\nconduct.\r\n\r\nUpon the whole, it will be seen from M. Mignet's judicial and masterly\r\nexhibition of the case, that there is very little ground upon which to base\r\na belief of the poor queen's innocence of the great crimes of which she is\r\naccused. For her wit, beauty, and misfortunes, notwithstanding her\r\nwickedness, the world clings to her memory, and until human nature is\r\nchanged men will receive proofs of her guilt as they would such proofs\r\nagainst a sister. M. Mignet presents these proofs so that they cannot be\r\nrejected.\r\n\r\nAmong the recent French Lives of Mary Stuart, is one by M. Duguard--a\r\nsentimental romance that acquired a temporary rage, and was aided by George\r\nSand in an elaborate letter of compliment addressed to the author. Miss\r\nAgnes Strickland will devote to the same heroine one entire volume of her\r\n_Lives of the Queens of Scotland._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmong the recently established publishing houses of this country no one\r\nappears to be conducted with more judgment--so far at least as the\r\nselection and execution of books is concerned--than that of W. M. Moore &\r\nCo. of Cincinnati. Among their original publications we have _Service\r\nAfloat and Ashore During the Mexican War_, by Lieut. SEMMES, (a second\r\nedition is just issued,) which by the common consent of reviewers is in\r\nattractiveness and absolute value inferior to none among the very large\r\nnumber of works that treat of the Mexican campaigns; and the list of their\r\nrepublications includes _The Course of Creation_, by the Rev. Dr. ANDERSON,\r\nof Scotland, in which, with unusual ability, candor, and eloquence, the\r\nrelations of natural science and the divine revelation are discussed; _The\r\nFootprints of the Creator_, the most able, and, in a scientific point of\r\nview, the most interesting of the works of HUGH MILLER; and _Scenes and\r\nLegends of the North of Scotland_, by the same author--a singularly\r\nentertaining performance. They have in press a volume on _Aesthetiks_, by\r\nProfessor MOFFAT, of Miami University, said to be written with singular\r\nability, and designed chiefly for purposes of education.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmong the most attractive books in recent religious literature is _The\r\nAncient and Modern History of the Rivers of the Bible_, lately published in\r\nLondon and just reprinted in New-York by Stringer & Townsend, with an\r\nintroduction by the Rev. Dr. George B. Cheever. The Euphrates, the Hiddekel\r\nor Tigris, the Chebar, the Ulai, the Jordan, the Jarmuk, the Jahbok, the\r\nArnon, the Kishon, and the Nile, the brooks Zered, Cherith, Kedron, Elah,\r\nEshcol, and Besor, and the pool of Siloam, are treated with a degree of\r\nknowledge and a pleasing simplicity of style somewhat rare in works of this\r\ndescription. The author has given particular attention to the discoveries\r\nof Rich, Layard, and others, by the Euphrates and the Tigris, and we have\r\nnowhere else a better exhibition in brief of the appearance of the\r\nclassical and sacred lands through which these rivers have flowed, half the\r\ntime since the creation was witness of the most remarkable events in human\r\nhistory. The volume is illustrated by excellent wood-engravings of natural\r\nscenery, antiquities, and existing cities.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmong the passengers from this port to Europe, in the steamer of the 10th\r\nSeptember, was the Abbe BRASSEUR DE BOURBOURG, for three years past an\r\nactive archaeological student in Mexico--that land of monuments and\r\ntraditions, whose ancient history is second only to that of Egypt in its\r\nfeatures of gloom and mystery. Some of the results of the Abbe's researches\r\nhave been indicated in his recently published _Cartas_, addressed to the\r\nDuc de Valmy, which are only the introduction to an elaborate work, within\r\nwhich it is the author's design to bring all that is known of the ancient\r\nand modern history of Mexico. Among the various materials for the\r\nillustration of that part of this work relating to the aborigines, the Abbe\r\nhas succeeded in obtaining from the neglected and not yet half explored\r\nlibraries of Mexico, the following original and valuable materials.\r\n\r\n1. Part 1. of a manuscript, by a priest of Chiapas, named Ordones,\r\nentitled, \"Historia del Cielo y de la Tierra,\" etc. etc., being a\r\ntranslation of an ancient Tzendal hieroglyphical MS. containing the Indian\r\naccount of the first settlement of Southern Mexico, the founding of _Na\r\nChan_, or Palenque, etc. Also, portions of Part II. of the same MS. 2.\r\nAnother manuscript of Ordones, without title, being a sort of memoir upon\r\nthe ruins of Palenque, and on Antonio Del Rio's expedition. 3. A few\r\nchapters of a MS. of Santa Clara, taken from an inedited history of Peru,\r\nbut relative to Mexico. 4. The original MS. of Cabrera upon Palenque. 5.\r\nPrinciples of a Grammar of the Tzotzil language. 6. Principles of a\r\nGrammar, Doctrinarium, and part of a Vocabulary of the Tzoque language\r\n(Chiapas). 7. A complete Vocabulary of the Maya and Spanish, with a great\r\nmany etymological explanations. 8. A Vocabulary of the Spanish and Maya,\r\nless complete, 9. Codex Chimalpopoca, being the manuscript of the\r\ncollection of Boturini, catalogued under the name of \"Historia de los Reyes\r\nde Culhuacan,\" in the Aztec or Nahua language. 10. Codex Gondra, being the\r\nsame known in the collection of Boturini, under the name of \"Historia\r\nTultaca,\" often cited by Gama; Spanish and Mexican. 11. \"Fuente de los\r\nVerbos y Substantives Mexicanos,\" a host of Spanish and Mexican\r\nvocabularies. 12. Relacion que le envia su Magestad por D. Juan Baptista de\r\nPomar, en 9 dias de Marz de 1582. This is a relation concerning Tezcuco.\r\n13. A MS. in Mexican hieroglyphics, being a title of property in the\r\nKingdom of the Tezcucan Prince Nezahualpilli, with a portrait of this\r\nprince, all on _Papel Maguey_. 14. Several prayer books in Mexican (MS.).\r\n15. A few prayers in Maya, MS. 16. The original MS. explanation of the\r\nCodex Borgia, composed by the Father Fabrega, for Cardinal Borgia, of which\r\nspeaks Baron Humboldt in his \"Vues de Cordilleres,\" etc. in Italian. 17. A\r\nshort vocabulary of the Huabi language spoken near Tehuantepec. The Abbe\r\nhas also four or five Mexican Grammars printed in Mexico, and other rare\r\nbooks not included in the catalogue of Ternaux Compans. The collection is,\r\ntherefore, more complete than any other made by any individual, and in the\r\nhands of an indefatigable student like the Abbe Bourbourg, will not fail to\r\nthrow a flood of light on the ancient history of Mexico.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA few weeks ago Mr. SCHOOLCRAFT published a complaint that his _Indian in\r\nhis Wigwam_ had been published without his knowledge by G. H. Derby & Co,\r\nof Buffalo, under the title of \"The American Indians, their History,\r\nCondition and Prospects.\" Messrs. Derby & Co. have replied in the _Literary\r\nWorld_, that they came honestly by the stereotype plates of the book, and\r\nthat as to the title, they \"_had an undoubted right to alter it_.\" We beg\r\nthese gentlemen and all others in like circumstances to reflect a little\r\nupon this doctrine, before endorsing it too positively. _However\r\nindisputable the title of Derby & Co. to the copyright of the book in\r\nquestion, they had no more right to change its name than they had to steal\r\nMr. Schoolcraft's money._ He is a very silly person who maintains the\r\ncontrary. Only the _author_ of a book has the right to change even the\r\nplace of a comma in it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. SIMMS has just published _Norman Maurice, or the Man of the People, an\r\nAmerican Drama, in Five Acts_. The scene is partly in Philadelphia, partly\r\nin St. Louis, and the plot involves the election of a senator from\r\nMissouri--as various passages disclose, in the present time. This is one of\r\nthe chief faults of the piece, as the history of Missouri politics is so\r\nfamiliar that no illusion in the case is possible. Aside from this, it is\r\nin many respects an admirable play--bold, simple, and yet striking in\r\nconception, and wrought out with a general fitness and force of incident\r\nand style that should secure it, in our opinion, immediate and very eminent\r\nsuccess on the stage. There has never been acted an _American_ play of\r\nequal merit. It was originally printed in the Southern Literary Messenger.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe are gratified to learn that the Rev. Dr. ALBRO, of Cambridge,\r\nMassachusetts, has in preparation a complete edition of the works of the\r\n\"learned and renowned Mr. Thomas Shepherd,\" who was the first minister in\r\nthat town. These works will fill several octavo volumes, and we regard them\r\nas among the most valuable relics of the Puritan age in New-England. We\r\nhave had for several years the very rare but incomplete collection of them\r\npublished by Prince, in 1747. Dr. Albro will have some advantages in\r\nwriting Shepherd's biography, which have not been enjoyed by others who\r\nhave recently essayed that service.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA new edition of _The Works of Henry Fielding_ will be published in a few\r\nweeks by Stringer & Townsend. Monsieur de Marivaux in France, says Bishop\r\nWarburton, and Henry Fielding, in England, stand the foremost among those\r\nwho have given a faithful and chaste copy of life and manners, and by\r\nenriching their romance with the best part of the comic art, may be said to\r\nhave brought it to perfection. Without attempting a defence of the\r\nimpurities which may be found in the novels and descriptions of Fielding,\r\nit should not be forgotten that the language used, and the manners depicted\r\nwere those of the age in which he lived, and for which he wrote without\r\nfurther regard to posterity than as his would serve as records and\r\nillustrations of past times. In our admiration of a new school of comic\r\nwriters, many may have forgotten this \"prose Homer of human nature,\" and it\r\nwill not be an unpleasing or profitless task for any to review and compare\r\nFielding and Smollet with Dickens, Lever, Thackeray and others now living,\r\nwho have attempted in the same manner to add to the general happiness.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe _Theory of Human Progression, and Natural Probability of a Reign of\r\nJustice_, a work which has received much attention in England, has just\r\nbeen republished by B. B. Mussey & Co., of Boston. The author says, \"The\r\ntruth I endeavor to inculcate is--That _Credence rules the world_--that\r\ncredence determines the condition and fixes the destiny of nations--that\r\n_true_ credence must ever entail with it a correct and beneficial system of\r\nsociety, while false credence must ever be accompanied by despotism,\r\nanarchy, and wrong--that before a nation can change its _condition_, it\r\nmust change its credence; that change of credence will of necessity be\r\naccompanied sooner or later by change of condition: and consequently, that\r\ntrue credence, or in other words _knowledge_, is the only means by which\r\nman can work out his well being and ameliorate his condition on the globe.\"\r\nThe author, who appears to be familiar in some way with the writings of\r\nComte, is unquestionably a man of abilities, and the work is in some\r\nrespects eminently suggestive; but it has not escaped severe criticism in\r\nsome of the theological and philosophical journals.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. BARTLETT'S _Nile Boat, or Glimpses of the Land of Egypt_, has been\r\nrepublished in a beautiful large octavo by the Harpers. The well-known\r\nauthor aims at affording a few distinct and lively impressions, by pencil\r\nand pen, of the more interesting objects on the banks of the Nile, with\r\nsuch historical and archaeological explanation as may satisfy the reader\r\nwithout confusing him with redundant details. Exaggeration has been\r\nstudiously avoided, and accuracy studied, and the illustrations have been\r\ncopied from original sketches taken on the spot.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDr. KITTO'S very valuable _Daily Bible Illustrations_ have been published\r\nby Messrs. Carter in four small octavo volumes. The entire work is to\r\nconsist of eight volumes, and will comprise a series of original readings\r\non selected passages of Scripture, illustrative of the history, biography,\r\ngeography, antiquities, and theology of the Bible. The subjects are\r\narranged so as to extend over two years' daily reading. While specially\r\ndesigned for the family circle, to the youthful members of which the\r\nillustrations will render the Scripture histories particularly agreeable,\r\nthe work is characterized by a degree of scholarship and ability that will\r\nmake it eminently entertaining and instructive to even the best informed\r\ngeneral reader.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe _Early Life and First Campaigns of Napoleon_, with a History of the\r\nBonaparte Family, and a Review of French Politics, to the year 1796, by B.\r\nP. POORE, has been published by Ticknor & Co. of Boston, and will be\r\ncontinued in several parts, completing the life of the Emperor. Mr. Poore\r\nwhile residing in Europe as the Historical Agent of Massachusetts,\r\ncollected many important documents illustrating his subject, and he will\r\nundoubtedly succeed in producing not only a very interesting biography, but\r\na comparatively original one.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. GEORGE TAYLOR, a young lawyer who has distinguished himself in his\r\nprofession, is the author of a clever book, entitled _Indications of the\r\nCreator, or the Natural Evidences of a Final Cause_. (Charles Scribner.)\r\nMr. Taylor takes the side of the Christian Religion, and of the real\r\nagainst the sham student of nature, in a reviewal of the general subject,\r\nin astronomy, geology, comparative physiology, and natural geography.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe _History of Pontiac_, which, while in press, several weeks ago, we\r\nnoticed at considerable length in this magazine, has since been published\r\nby Little & Brown of Boston, and Bentley of London, and by the common\r\nconsent of the reviewers it places Mr. PARKMAN among our most able and\r\npleasing historians. Certainly no subject of its kind has hitherto been\r\ntreated with as much felicity.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe beautiful edition of the _Works of Thomas De Quincey_, which Ticknor &\r\nCo. have for some time been publishing in Boston, will soon be completed,\r\nand the eight or ten duodecimos which it will comprise will be added to as\r\nmany libraries as are owned by persons of a genuine appreciation in\r\nliterature.

We have scarcely ever seen so melancholy an\r\nillustration of incompetence for a task voluntarily assumed. It appears\r\nthat to every woman whose name he had ever seen in print Dr. John S. Hart\r\nsent nearly a year ago a circular from which the following paragraphs are\r\nextracts:\r\n\r\n     Authors _interested in having their merits placed on a\r\n     proper footing before the public_, will contribute important\r\n     facilities to the accomplishment of this end by furnishing\r\n     me with information in regard to the following particulars:\r\n\r\n     1.

Date of birth, _where there is no objection_.\r\n\r\n     6. Extracts.--_Indicate any passages_, amounting in all to\r\n     five or six octavo pages, that, in the opinion of the author\r\n     or her friends, may be taken as fair specimens of her style.\r\n     The passages should be such as are complete in themselves,\r\n     and contain something of general interest.\r\n\r\n     8. Critiques and commendatory notices.--Well-written\r\n     critiques upon the author's style or writings, whether\r\n     published or unpublished, will be acceptable. In almost\r\n     every case, probably, articles of this kind have been\r\n     published, or _exist in manuscript_, or _may be written for\r\n     the occasion_ by those _entirely acquainted with the\r\n     subject_, and if forwarded would furnish the present editor\r\n     the most reliable means of doing full justice in each\r\n     particular case.\r\n\r\nThe sort of \"criticism\" which the volume contains may easily be inferred,\r\nas may be the class of literary women who would take any notice of an\r\napplication conceived in a spirit so offensive to delicacy and common\r\nself-respect. Accounts of the writings of Miss Sedgwick, Mrs. Kirkland,\r\nMrs. Oakes Smith, Mrs. Sigourney, Miss McIntosh, Margaret Fuller, and a few\r\nmore, were to be found in a well-known book published in the same city, and\r\nof course therefore are included, but to show how ignorant the author is of\r\nthe field he attempts to survey, let us place in one column some of the\r\nnames he has altogether omitted, and in another an equal number from among\r\nthose he has inserted.\r\n\r\n_Names omitted._                _Dr. Hart's Female Prose Writers._\r\nMRS. ROBINSON, [Talvi.]               Sarah Hall,\r\nMRS. RICHARD K. HAIGHT,               Sarah H. Browne,\r\nMRS. WM. C. RIVES,                    Maria J.B. Browne,\r\nMRS. T.J. CONANT,                     Elizabeth Larcombe,\r\nEMMA WILLARD,                         Clara Moore,\r\nF. WRIGHT D'ARUSMONT,                 Ann E. Porter,\r\nCATHERINE E. BEECHER,                 Ann T. Wilbur,\r\nANNA CORA MOWATT,                     Eliza L. Sproat,\r\nELIZA BUCKMINSTER LEE,                E. W. Barnes,\r\nELIZABETH P. PEABODY,                 Caroline Orne,\r\nELIZA L. FOLLEN,                      Caroline May,\r\nMARIA BROOKS,                         Julia C.R. Dorr,\r\nSARAH HELEN WHITMAN,                  Mary E. Morange,\r\nMISS H. LEE,                          Mary Elizabeth Lee,\r\nMRS. PUTNAM,                          Elizabeth Bogart,\r\nMRS. SOUTHWORTH,                      Mary J. Windle,\r\nMISS A. E. DUPUY,                     Frances B. M. Brotherson,\r\nMISS ALICE CAREY, &c. &c.,            &c. &c.\r\n\r\nOf the persons named in the second column we believe _not one_ has the\r\nslightest claim to be mentioned in a survey of the compositions of the\r\nFemale Prose Writers of America. It is not unlikely that some of them have\r\ncapacities for literature, but if so the public has no sufficient proof of\r\nit. On the other hand, see whose places they occupy.\r\n\r\nMrs. Robinson and Madame d'Arusmont were born in Europe, but this fact\r\ncould not have influenced Dr. Hart, who has given a conspicuous place to\r\nMiss Caroline May, an Englishwoman, who has been in this country less than\r\na quarter as long as either of these distinguished persons. Mrs. Robinson\r\nis the wife of our great orientalist, and is herself one of the most\r\nlearned women in the world; she has distinguished herself in American\r\nhistory, in romance, and in criticism, beyond almost any writer of her sex.\r\nThe authoress of \"A Few Days in Athens,\" must certainly be regarded as one\r\nof the most able literary women of this age, whatever may be thought of\r\nsome of her principles. Mrs. Haight is well known by two of the most\r\nbrilliant volumes of travels ever published by the Harpers. Mrs. Rives\r\n(wife of our minister to France), in her \"Tales and Souvenirs of a\r\nResidence in Europe\" (published by Lea and Blanchard), and in other\r\nwritings, displays abilities that make her right to recognition in such a\r\nwork unquestionable. Mrs. Conant (wife of the eminent Hebrew professor) is\r\na woman of great and varied erudition, and ranks, generally, with Mrs.\r\nRobinson. Mrs. Willard is universally known by her valuable writings on\r\neducation, in history, and in science, and by her interesting \"Journal of a\r\nResidence in Europe.\" Catherine E. Beecher, the authoress of \"Letters on\r\nthe Difficulties of Religion,\" we believe is regarded as one of the ablest\r\nof the celebrated family to which she belongs, and as having the most\r\nprofound and masculine intelligence exhibited in contributions made by her\r\ncountrywomen to literature. Mrs. Mowatt is entitled to a high rank among\r\nour female novelists. Mrs. Lee, by her lives of Jean Paul and the\r\nBuckminsters and the Old Painters, her novel of \"Naomi or Boston Two\r\nHundred Years Ago,\" and other works, is omitted with about as much reason\r\nas the Prince of Denmark might be from Hamlet. Another lady of this name,\r\nthe authoress of \"The Huguenots,\" \"The Three Experiments of Living,\" \"The\r\nLife and Times of Luther,\" &c., we believe has done more good by her\r\nwritings than any other woman in America, and for literary abilities she is\r\nentitled to distinguished praise. Miss Peabody is too well known by her\r\nessays in AEsthetics to need characterization. Mrs. Follen is one of the\r\nbest known, and most esteemed female writers of the time. Mrs. Brooks's\r\n\"Idomen, a Tale of the Vale of Yumuri,\" is an exquisite production, which\r\nalone would preserve the name of _Maria del Occidente_ in the lists of\r\nillustrious women. Mrs. Whitman is a writer of remarkable acuteness and\r\nrichness, as is shown by her essays on the Transcendental Philosophy. Mrs.\r\nPutnam (a sister of James Russell Lowell), is distinguished not more for\r\nthat masterly controversy which she carried on last summer with the _North\r\nAmerican Review_, respecting the Revolutions in Northern Europe, than for\r\nthat extensive and varied learning, among the fruits of which were the\r\nfirst American translations of Swedish and Danish literature, including\r\nsome of the novels of Miss Bremer. Mrs. Southworth, by her \"Deserted Wife,\"\r\n\"Mother-in-law,\" &c., appears to have acquired a larger share of popularity\r\nthan is enjoyed by any of her female American contemporaries. Miss A. E.\r\nDupuy, authoress of \"The Conspirator\" (lately published by the Appletons),\r\nhas won praise from eminent critics in the same department. Miss Alice\r\nCarey, by her \"Ill-starred,\" and other novelettes, has evinced the\r\npossession of such genius as entitles her to a place in the very highest\r\nrank of our literary women. And who that knows any thing of American\r\nliterature forgets Mrs. Sedgwick, who wrote \"Allen Prescott;\" or Mrs.\r\nLouisa J. Hall, who wrote \"Joanna of Naples?\"\r\n\r\nWe think we have shown that Dr. John S. Hart knows nothing about \"The\r\nFemale Prose Writers of America.\" Our readers certainly can judge for\r\nthemselves; but to us the selection of the persons who are named in the\r\nsecond of the above columns, to the exclusion of those whose names are in\r\nthe first column, would seem to be an elaborate quiz, if the manner of the\r\nthing did not evince a genuine earnestness of purpose. We might have\r\ndismissed the book with half a dozen lines, but when we have occasion to\r\ncondemn any performance thus decidedly, we think it but fair to prove the\r\njustice of our judgment.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA second edition of MRS. LEE'S _Memoirs of the Rev. Joseph Buckminster,\r\nD.D., and of his Son, the Rev. Joseph Stevens Buckminster_, has just been\r\nissued by Ticknor, Reed & Fields, of Boston. In the religious and literary\r\nhistory of this country there have been few more interesting characters\r\nthan the Buckminsters, and this volume of their memoirs is very judiciously\r\nand tastefully written. Mrs. Lee began her task in an attempt to furnish\r\nsome materials respecting her father, and brother, for the Rev. Dr.\r\nSprague, of Albany, who has been several years engaged on a work to be\r\nentitled \"Annals of the American Pulpit, or Biographical Notices of Eminent\r\nAmerican Clergymen, of various Denominations.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA very elegant edition of the Moral Reflections, Sentences and Maxims, of\r\nROCHEFOUCAULD, has been published by the well-known bibliopole, Mr. Gowan,\r\nof Fulton-street. The wise French worldling maintains still a precedence of\r\nall the writers of his class, and such an impression of his master-work\r\nwill increase his audience.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmong the new works announced by Mr. Hart of Philadelphia is the\r\n_Principles of Organic Chemistry_, by Dr. CARL LOEWIG, professor of\r\nChemistry in the University of Zurich, translated by David Breed, M.D., of\r\nNew-York.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn a brief and hastily written paragraph in the last _International_, we\r\nreferred to a novel by DR. HUNTINGTON, as _Alice, or the Mysteries_,\r\ninstead of _Alice, or the New Una_,--a mistake which any reader of ordinary\r\nintelligence, who had ever seen the work in question, might easily have\r\ncorrected. The character of the literary performances of Dr. Huntington is\r\nsuch as to justify some curiosity respecting his personal history, and in\r\ntoo carelessly attempting to give it, we fell into some errors, which he\r\n\"corrects\" in a letter to the _Courier and Enquirer_, saying--\r\n\r\n     \"The novel of _Alice, or the Mysteries, I did not write_,\r\n     although I am forced to admit that it 'displayed a great\r\n     deal of talent as well as a very peculiar morality;' (indeed\r\n     its morality I never did quite approve)--_I never was a\r\n     village doctor--I never was a Congregational minister--and I\r\n     am not now a Catholic priest._\"\r\n\r\nWe may amend our statement thus: Dr. Huntington is the author of a work\r\nentitled, _Alice, or the New Una_, which was very commonly regarded as the\r\nmost licentious publication of its season; we understand that in his youth\r\nhe was somewhat remarkable for the grimness of his Calvinism; that while a\r\nCongregationalist he became a doctor in medicine; that he afterwards took\r\norders in the Episcopal church; that he left that church to enter a society\r\nof Roman Catholics; and that it was rumored soon after that he had become a\r\npriest, but, it is now understood, was prevented by disqualifying domestic\r\nrelations. We admit that our paragraph had some little inaccuracies, but\r\ncertainly they are more easy of explanation than Dr. Huntington's\r\nintimation in his letter of July to the London _Morning Chronicle_ that the\r\nauthor of _Alban_ and _Alice_ is a clergyman of the Protestant Episcopal\r\nChurch!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHARPER & BROTHERS have just published _Forest Life and Forest Trees_, by G.\r\nS. Springer, of Boston; Judge Haliburton's recent work on America which we\r\nnoticed last month; and Lamartine's _Restoration of the Monarchy in\r\nFrance_, the most brilliant, superficial and false production of a writer\r\nnever remarkable for depth or conscience. They have in press a new volume\r\nof Mr. Hildreth's capital _History of the United States_; Mr. G. P. R.\r\nJames's _Lectures on Civilization_, delivered in various parts of the\r\ncountry last winter; _Sixteen Months in the Gold Diggings_, by Daniel B.\r\nWoods; _Wesley and Methodism_, by Isaac Taylor; _The Fifteen Decisive\r\nBattles of the World_, by Professor Creasy; new volumes of _Memoirs of Dr.\r\nChalmers_ and Miss Strickland's _Lives of the Queens of Scotland_; and\r\nseveral new English and American novels.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA very interesting handbook of London, somewhat different from any work of\r\nthe kind yet published, is soon to appear in this city under the title of\r\n_Memories of the Great Metropolis_, profusely illustrated with wood\r\nengravings, and with a higher literary finish than is common in such\r\nperformances.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Dr. HENRY A. BOARDMAN, of Philadelphia, one of the wise, learned\r\nand faithful divines by whom is preserved the best reputation of the best\r\nvocation, has just published (Lippincott, Grambo, & Co.) a volume of\r\ndiscourses entitled, _The Bible in the Family, or Hints on Domestic\r\nHappiness_. It is quite aside, and evidently was intended to be, from the\r\nusual routine, though not beyond the legitimate domain of the pulpit. We\r\nhave treatises on the relative duties, but no book, we believe, of this\r\nsort--not a treatise,--which is adapted to American society. Dr. Boardman's\r\nwork is attractive for its original and striking observation and scholarly\r\nfinish as a piece of literature, while calculated to be eminently useful\r\nfor its illustrations of practical religion.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmong the novelties about to be issued from the press of Mr. Redfield, of\r\nClinton Hall, is a series of Portraits or Biographies by ARSENE HOUSSAYE,\r\nof the men and women of the eighteenth century, comprising the\r\nphilosophers, poets, artists--indeed all who lent a grace to or stamped\r\ntheir impress on the long and desolate reign of Louis Quinze. They are\r\nexecuted with a firm hand and possess the brilliant coloring of fiction,\r\nwithout deviating from historic truth. It is the only work that gives a\r\njust idea of the gay, witty and dissipated society that existed in France\r\nprevious to the Revolution, and was one of the causes of that event. Mr.\r\nRedfield also announces _The Ladies of the Covenant_, a series of\r\ninteresting biographical illustrations of the religious history of\r\nScotland, by the Rev. JAMES ANDERSON; _Sorcery and Magic_, by THOMAS\r\nWRIGHT, of the Shakspeare and Percy societies; and a volume of _Tales and\r\nSketches_, by Miss CAROLINE CHESEBRO.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere is in the possession of descendants of JONATHAN EDWARDS a MS. volume\r\nof Discourses on Christian Love, in his own handwriting. The paper looks\r\ndingy, but the writing is regular and clear. It is now being transcribed,\r\nand will be published during the autumn by Robert Carter & Brothers. The\r\nsame house have in the press _Lectures on the Evidences of Christianity,\r\ndelivered at the University of Virginia, during the Session of 1850-51_,\r\namong the contributors to which are the Rev. Drs. Alexander, Breckenridge,\r\nPlumer, McGill, Rice, Sampson, Ruffner, &c.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe _Knickerbocker_ has recently contained several chapters under the title\r\nof _The Sketch Book of Me, Meister Karl_, which have the best quality of\r\nRabelais and Sterne. We have heard them attributed to Mr. CHARLES G.\r\nLELAND, of Philadelphia--one of the youngest of our authors, and one of the\r\nfinest scholars and rarest humorists of this time, We believe Pennsylvania\r\nhas no other son or citizen who gives fairer promise of distinction in\r\nletters.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nISAAC TAYLOR'S _Elements of Thought, a concise Explanation of the Principal\r\nTerms employed in the several branches of Intellectual Philosophy_, has\r\nbeen published by W. Gowans, from the ninth London edition.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. CARLYLE'S _Life of John Stirling_ is in the press of Phillips & Sampson\r\nof Boston, and will soon be issued. From the same house we are to have\r\n_Memoirs of Sarah Margaret Fuller, Marchesa d' Ossoli_, edited by Ralph\r\nWaldo Emerson and William H. Channing; and a new and very beautiful edition\r\nof Robinson Crusoe, with new illustrations.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe American annuals for the present season are not very numerous. Mr.\r\nWalker, of Fulton-street, has published _The Odd Fellow's Offering_, which\r\ncontains excellent contributions by Mr. Simms, Mr. Saunders, Mrs. Hewitt,\r\nMrs. Kirkland, Mrs. Kimball, Mrs. Oakes Smith, and other writers; and\r\nLippencott, Grambo & Co., of Philadelphia, have published the handsomest\r\nbook of its class for the year, in _The Iris_, with unique and beautiful\r\nillustrations from drawings by Captain Eastman, U.S.A., whose wife writes a\r\nlarge portion of the contents.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Vagamundo, or the Attache in Spain_, by JOHN E. WARREN, is a very\r\ndelightful book illustrative of society, scenery, &c., in \"old, renowned,\r\nromantic Spain,\" where the author was attached to the American legation. As\r\nMr. Warren while abroad was a correspondent of _The International_, it may\r\nbe suspected that we have some prejudice in his favor--which indeed is very\r\ntrue--and therefore we inform our readers that of the English edition of\r\nthis work, and of the American edition, all the critics have given such\r\nopinions as delight an author and bring money to his publisher. Mr. Warren\r\nis the author of _Para, or Scenes and Adventures on the Banks of the\r\nAmazon_, lately published by Putnam. It is his vocation to travel and make\r\nbooks, as these two performances very plainly show. (Charles Scribner.)\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. CHARLES ASTOR BRISTED, whose very clever sketches of American Society\r\nwe have copied from month to month from _Fraser's Magazine_, has in the\r\npress of Putnam a work entitled _Five Years in an English University_. Mr.\r\nPutnam has in press also _The Shield_, by Miss FENIMORE COOPER, and _The\r\nMonuments of Central and Western America_, by Dr. HAWKS, besides several\r\nbeautiful souvenir volumes, for the coming holidays, which embrace\r\ncontributions by the best authors and artists of the country.\r\n\r\nMr. SIMMS, has just published (by A. Hart), a new novel under the title of\r\n_Catherine Walton_, which is equal to his best productions. The scene is in\r\nSouth Carolina, during the Revolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Fine Arts._\r\n\r\n\r\nPAUL DELAROCHE'S picture of _Marie Antoinette_ is to be engraved on a large\r\nscale. Delaroche has represented the unfortunate _Autrichienne_ descending\r\nthe stairs from the terrible tribunal which pronounced her death-sentence.\r\nShe is attired in black, with a white scarf round her shoulders. A singular\r\nbut striking effect, which the painter has rendered with habitual felicity,\r\nis the altered color of her hair, which is said to have turned white. The\r\nartist has shown the alteration, by a few stray auburn locks, blanched at\r\nthe root. In the background is represented the mob which greeted with\r\nexecrations the \"widow Capet\" on the morning of the 15th October, 1793.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Print of the London Art-Union for the current year is from one of Mr.\r\nFrith's pictures, _An English Merry-making in the Olden Time_, engraved by\r\nHolt, so carefully as to bring out every detail and shade of character in\r\nthe original with the greatest fidelity and spirit. The merry-making\r\nconsists mainly in the performance, beneath some noble trees, of the old\r\ncountry-dance of Sir Roger de Coverley, by a party of rustics. A couple of\r\nlovers are seated in the foreground, and close by them is a group of merry\r\ndamsels hauling a jolly old farmer to the dance, while the dame encourages\r\ntheir attack.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA few friends of the poet Motherwell, of Glasgow, have just erected a\r\nbeautiful monument to him in that city. It is the work of Mr. Fillans, a\r\nfriend of the deceased, and is in the form of a small Gothic temple,\r\nconsisting of a quadrangular pediment of solid masonry, supporting a light\r\ndome on four pillars; the dome being decorated with carvings of shields and\r\n_fleurs de lis_. In the space between the pillars is a sarcophagus, on\r\nwhich is placed a termini bust of the poet.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe German Painter WINTERHALTER, whose pencil is mainly dedicated to\r\ncourtly chronicles and countenances, has just completed another of his\r\nnumerous royal family groups. It represents the Duke of Wellington in the\r\nact of offering an affectionate _souvenir_ to his little godson Prince\r\nArthur, on the occasion of his first birth-day anniversary.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Count de THUN, a distinguished Austrian painter, and M. Ruben, director\r\nof the Royal Academy of the Fine Arts in Prague, have been commissioned by\r\nthe Austrian government to examine into the several organizations of the\r\nschools of the arts of design in England, France, and Germany, with a view\r\nto propose such ameliorations as the examination may suggest in the various\r\nschools of Austria.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the closing weeks of the Great Exhibition in London, several\r\n_chef-d'oeuvres_ of art have been received, and among them one by the\r\ncelebrated Dutch sculptor, Van der Ven, representing the Temptation of Eve.\r\nIt attracts a great deal of attention. The treatment of the subject is bold\r\nand original, the form of the first woman being developed with freedom,\r\ngrace, and life-like effect. One of its chief excellencies is, that in its\r\ncomposition there is no trace of that disposition to borrow from the\r\nclassic styles of antiquity, instead of relying upon nature, which so often\r\ndetracts from the merit of modern sculpture. Mr. Spense, an English artist\r\nat Rome, has also lately contributed a statue of Burns's Highland Mary,\r\nwhich is much admired.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMR. RUSKIN has published a new pamphlet entitled _Pre-Raphaelitism_, in\r\nwhich nature, and not the critical writers, the applauded models of the\r\nday, or tradition, is declared the only true guide to excellence in art;\r\nand all modern art is held to be depraved in taste, as it were, an arid\r\ndesert, in which he endeavors to set up two landmarks, John Everett,\r\nMillais, and Joseph Mallord Turner. Between these two poles stand William\r\nHunt, who paints still life; Samuel Prout, of street architecture renown;\r\nJohn Lewis, the harem-scene delineator; and finally, Mulready and Landseer.\r\nThe essay is keenly reviewed in the _Athenaeum_, _Times_, &c., but is\r\nadmitted by all to be characteristically eloquent.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe _American Art-Union_ opened its galleries on Monday evening, September\r\n22. The collection of pictures we understand is unusually good. The\r\noccasion was one of much good feeling and enjoyment. Speeches were made by\r\nthe President of the Art-Union, by Mr. Conrad, Secretary of War, by Rev.\r\nDr. Osgood, Parke Godwin, C. A. Dana, Mr. Thompson of the Southern Literary\r\nMessenger, Judge Campbell, General Wetmore, and several other gentlemen.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPOWERS'S celebrated statue of EVE, which was lost off Cape Palos in May,\r\n1850, arrived in New-York a few days ago, in the British schooner Volo,\r\nfrom Carthagena, not having sustained any material injury. A letter from\r\nMr. Powers respecting this statue was printed in the last number of _The\r\nInternational_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMR. LEUTZE, after a long absence from this country, has returned, bringing\r\nwith him his greatest work, _Washington Crossing the Delaware_, which will\r\nsoon be exhibited at the Stuyvesant Institute. Mr. Leutze was received with\r\ngreat applause at the late meeting of the Art-Union.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Historical Review of the Month._\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the UNITED STATES, since our last publication, no events have occupied\r\nmore attention than the great _Agricultural State Fair_ which was held\r\nrecently at Rochester, and of which we shall give a particular account,\r\nillustrated with numerous engravings, in our next number; and the _Railroad\r\nFestival_ at Boston, which was held at the same time. At the latter were\r\npresent the President of the United States, the Secretary of State, and\r\nother members of the Cabinet, the Governor-General of Canada, his Aids and\r\nCabinet, the principal members of the Canadian Parliament, and the leading\r\nmerchants in the Canadian cities, the Governors of New England states, the\r\nPresidents of the railways in New England, the Mayors of the cities of New\r\nEngland and many other influential persons interested in railways and steam\r\nnavigation. Speeches were made by the President of the United States, by\r\nLord Elgin, Daniel Webster, Edward Everett, and many others, and the\r\noccasion was altogether one of the most brilliant and satisfactory of its\r\nkind ever known in this country.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th of September Mr. Gorsuch, a citizen of Maryland, accompanied by\r\nseveral officers and other persons, proceeded from Philadelphia to\r\nChristiana, near Lancaster, for the purpose of arresting two negroes\r\nclaimed under a law of the United States as fugitive slaves. In order to\r\nresist the execution of the law the negroes of the vicinity rallied to the\r\nnumber of seventy or eighty, armed themselves with guns, and fired on the\r\nparty of whites, killing Mr. Gorsuch, and mortally wounding his son. The\r\nnegroes were also considerably injured by a discharge from revolvers by the\r\nparty with the officers. It appears from a statement published by the Rev.\r\nMr. Gorsuch, a son of the claimant of the negroes, that a conspiracy was\r\nplanned beforehand, to resist the officers of the law in the execution of\r\ntheir duty; and that it was not confined to the negroes, but was apparently\r\nunder the guidance and control of whites. Mr. Gorsuch says that while the\r\nofficers were awaiting the decision of the blacks, a white man rode up;\r\nthat his presence seemed to inspire the negroes with renewed hostility;\r\nthat he refused, when summoned, to aid the officers, and threatened them\r\nwith bloodshed if they persisted in executing the law. It is further\r\nalleged that it was after receiving some communication from this person\r\nthat the negroes rushed on the officers and killed Mr. Gorsuch. Since then\r\na correspondence on the subject has been held between the national\r\nexecutive and the executives of the states of Maryland and Pennsylvania.\r\nThe slaves have not been recovered, but many arrests have been made of\r\npersons charged with conspiracy to prevent the execution of the laws, and\r\nwith treason.\r\n\r\nThe Free Soil party of Massachusetts, at a State Convention, held Sept. 16,\r\nnominated for Governor, John G. Palfrey, and for Lieutenant-Governor, Amasa\r\nWalker. The nomination for Governor was first tendered to Stephen C.\r\nPhillips, of Salem, who declined. The democrats held their State Convention\r\non the 26th of August. They passed resolutions decidedly in favor of the\r\nUnion, and against all anti-national and anti-sectional agitation. George\r\nS. Boutwell was nominated for Governor, and Henry W. Cushman for\r\nLieutenant-Governor, and Charles G. Greene, Henry H. Childs, and Isaac\r\nDavis, were appointed delegates to the National Democratic Convention,\r\nwhich was recommended to be holden at Baltimore in May, 1852. The Whig\r\nState Convention was held at Springfield on the 10th of September and, on\r\nthe first ballot, Robert C. Winthrop was nominated as their candidate for\r\nGovernor, and George Grinnell as their candidate for Lieutenant-Governor.\r\nThe proceedings were very harmonious, and the address of the chairman, and\r\nthe resolutions passed by the convention, were of a strong national and\r\nUnion character. Edward Everett, George Ashmun, and Seth Sprague, were\r\nchosen delegates from the State at large to the National Whig Convention.\r\n\r\nIn New-York the Whig State Convention assembled at Syracuse on the 11th of\r\nSeptember. George W. Patterson, was nominated for Controller; James M.\r\nCook, for Treasurer; Samuel A. Foote, for Judge of the Court of Appeals;\r\nJames C. Forsyth, for Secretary of State; Daniel Ullmann, Jr., for\r\nAttorney-General; Henry Fitzhugh, for Canal Commissioner; and A. H. Wells,\r\nfor State Prison Inspector. Resolutions were adopted, declaring that the\r\nproceeding of the two Whig State Committees at Albany, for the union and\r\nco-operation of the party, was \"the result of honorable and patriotic\r\ndevotion to the Constitution, and for the best interests of the whole\r\npeople, and that it is adopted and approved by this Convention;\" and\r\npledging the whigs to the most liberal conduct in the matter of internal\r\nimprovements. The Democratic Convention met at the same place on the tenth.\r\nResolutions were adopted reaffirming the principles avowed in the\r\nresolutions adopted by the State Convention held at the same place last\r\nyear. The following persons were nominated for the several state offices:\r\nJohn C. Wright, for Controller; Henry S. Randall, for Secretary of State;\r\nLevi S. Chatfield, for Attorney-General; Benjamin Welch, Jr., for\r\nTreasurer; Horace Wheaton, for Canal Commissioner; W. J. M'Alpine, for\r\nState Engineer; General Storms, for Inspector of State Prisons; and A. S.\r\nJohnson, for Judge of the Court of Appeals.\r\n\r\nThe Maryland Whig State Convention at Baltimore, September 17th, nominated,\r\nwith great unanimity, the following State ticket: For Controller of the\r\nTreasury, George C. Morgan; Lottery Commissioner, O. H. Hicks; Commissioner\r\nof the Land Office, George C. Brewer. The Democrats, at their State\r\nConvention held at Baltimore, on the 12th, nominated Philip Francis Thomas,\r\nof Baltimore City, for Controller; James Murray, of Annapolis, for\r\nCommissioner of the Land Office; Thomas R. Stewart, of Caroline, for\r\nLottery Commissioner.\r\n\r\nIn Virginia, an election for members of Congress, under the old system and\r\napportionment, takes place on the fourth Thursday in the present month. The\r\nquestion of the ratification of the new constitution is to be decided under\r\nthe universal suffrage system, on the same day. Members of the Legislature\r\nare also to be elected, according to the old apportionment; but if the new\r\nconstitution is ratified, the legislative election is to be superseded by a\r\nnew election, under the new apportionment, in December next. At the same\r\ntime, a Governor and Lieutenant-Governor &c., are to be elected; and next\r\nspring, the county officers will be chosen in another election; after which\r\nthe State elections will occur regularly from time to time.\r\n\r\nIn South Carolina a large meeting was held at Charleston, on the 28th of\r\nAugust, in favor of co-operation between the slaveholding states, and\r\nopposed to separate State Action for the purpose of resistance to the\r\nNational Government. John Rutledge presided, and in the list of other\r\nofficers we find the names of many of the most distinguished citizens of\r\nthe State. Our advices from California, to the 14th of August, are of a\r\nfavorable character. In San Francisco business is active in spite of the\r\neffects of the recent conflagration, and the administration of justice is\r\nplaced on a more substantial basis. Great activity prevails in the mining\r\ndistricts, and the work of constructing canals on various gold-bearing\r\nstreams is vigorously advancing. Accounts from Utah represent the new\r\nterritory in a prosperous condition, with the exception of some slight\r\nIndian difficulties. The crops are unusually fine. The emigrants for Salt\r\nLake and Oregon are progressing prosperously. The Mormons have extended\r\ntheir settlements along the base of the mountains, northward, and facing\r\nthe Great Salt Lake, ninety miles, nearly to Bear River ferry. They are\r\nfast taking up all the good land in the Valley, and are engaged in building\r\na railroad to the mountain, some seven or eight miles, on which to\r\ntransport the materials for their great temple. Dr. John M. Bernhisel has\r\nbeen chosen Territorial Delegate to Congress.\r\n\r\nIt has been stated that the Survey of the Mexican Boundary Commission was\r\nprogressing rapidly westward. The astronomers and surveyors of the American\r\nand Mexican Commissioners had joined forces, and their advanced parties had\r\nreached a point thirty miles west of Rio Mienlies. The line was to run\r\neight or ten miles south of Cooks Spring, thus giving the United States the\r\nwhole of the road to the Copper Mines, and the only route which can be\r\ntraversed by wagons. We have later intelligence, that in consequence of a\r\ndisagreement between the Commissioners and the Surveyor, the operations of\r\nthe Commission are almost suspended.\r\n\r\nDr. Gardner, of fraudulent Mexican claim notoriety, has returned to\r\nWashington, surrendered himself into the hands of the United States\r\nauthorities, and given bail in the sum of $40,000 to appear for trial at\r\nthe December term. Senator Chase, of Ohio, has issued a manifesto in which\r\nhe announces his intention to adhere to the platform and support the ticket\r\nof the Ohio Democratic Convention. But the ground of this determination is,\r\nthat he considers the action of that Convention, besides being acceptable\r\non other topics, as in effect indorsing the Free Soil doctrines. John\r\nMcPherson Berrien has declared his intention of acting with the Union\r\nparty. Gen. Quitman, before the late election, withdrew from the contest,\r\nas the secession candidate for Governor of Mississippi. The Special\r\nConvention of the Protestant Episcopal Church for the election of an\r\nAssistant Bishop fur the Diocese of Illinois, was held at Pekin, Sept. 8,\r\nand resulted in the election of Dr. Whitehouse, of New-York. The annual\r\nmeeting of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions was\r\nheld at Portland, on the 9th day of September. The President, Theodore\r\nFrelinghuysen, presided, and the affairs of the society and its prospects,\r\nwere presented in several very interesting reports.\r\n\r\nIn the last number of this magazine, we stated the failure of some\r\nineffectual risings in CUBA, and supposed that the peace of that island was\r\nreestablished, at least for a considerable period. But, about the end of\r\nAugust, the country became exceedingly interested respecting the fate of\r\nthe steamer Pampero, which, it had become known, had left New Orleans with\r\nseveral hundred men, under the command of General Narciso Lopez, with the\r\nintention of landing at some point on the Cuban coast. It afterwards was\r\ndisclosed that the party, which consisted of 480 men, designed to go to the\r\nRiver St. John, and effect a junction with an artillery force which was\r\nwaiting there, and then land at some point in the central department; but\r\non touching at Key West for stores, they were informed of a revolt of the\r\nVuelta de Abajo, and Lopez resolved to land in that district. The party\r\ndisembarked at the small town of Morillos, at two o'clock, on the morning\r\nof the 12th of August; and, soon after, General Lopez sent a pronunciamento\r\nto Los Pazos, in which he informed the inhabitants he was about to march on\r\nthem, and would give no quarter to any who did not join him. Being without\r\nmeans of transportation, he ordered Colonel Crittenden to remain and\r\nprotect the baggage, together with 1000 musket cartridges, 3000 muskets,\r\nand 700 pounds of powder in kegs. He told Crittenden that he would send for\r\nhim at Los Pazos, and took with him 323 men, leaving 130 with Crittenden,\r\nwho, at 11 o'clock that night, started to rejoin him. Their advance was\r\nslow, and on the morning of the 13th, while eating breakfast, they were\r\nsurprised by a report of musketry, and the whistling of bullets, from a\r\nbody of the enemy, who were repulsed with a loss of nine killed. A short\r\ntime after they repeated the attack. Crittenden charged, and forced them to\r\nretreat to a chaparral, from which, as the invaders advanced, they opened a\r\ndestructive fire. Finding he could not maintain his position, Crittenden\r\nordered a return, and the enemy again advanced. At this time, he wished a\r\nsmall party to attain a position at the right flank of the enemy, to charge\r\nfrom that side at the same moment he charged on the front. Lieutenants Van\r\nVechten and Crafts, with twenty men, volunteered, and attained the\r\nposition. After remaining about half an hour, and hearing nothing of\r\nCrittenden, they were compelled to retreat, leaving their baggage and\r\nstores. The next morning this party succeeded in joining Lopez at Los\r\nPazos, half an hour before he marched from that place. Gen. Enna, commander\r\nof the Spanish troops, immediately attacked Lopez with 800 men. After a\r\nhard fight, the enemy retreated, leaving a large number (among whom were\r\nseveral of their highest officers) dead and wounded. Lopez lost in killed\r\nand wounded, thirty men, among whom were Col. Dowzeman, Lieut. Laviseau,\r\nkilled; Gen. Pragay, Capts. Brigham and Gonti, mortally wounded. On the\r\nmorning of the 14th, Lopez marched into the mountains, and on that day he\r\nwas attacked by 900 men. The action lasted three hours, and the Spaniards\r\nretreated with a large loss. At the moment that the Spaniards retreated in\r\none direction, Lopez issued an order to retreat in an opposite one, and\r\nmade a forced march of 18 miles in 5 hours, over a mountain road. On the\r\n19th, being still in the mountains, two leagues from Bahia, he was\r\novertaken by a heavy rain storm, which destroyed the greater part of his\r\nammunition, and rendered the firearms entirely useless. On the morning of\r\nthe 20th, the sentry was surprised and shot, and Lopez was completely\r\nrouted, flying to the mountains. Lopez escaped on horseback, with nothing\r\nbut what he wore. He encamped on one of the mountains, exposed to the\r\nviolence of a terrific storm. On the evening of the 21st, having been\r\nforty-eight hours without food, a horse was killed and divided among 125\r\nmen, who were all that remained with him. They wandered about until mid-day\r\nof the 24th, when a halt was ordered, and on examination it was found that\r\nthey had only 60 serviceable muskets, and about 40 dry cartridges. They\r\ncommenced a retreat, when a force of 900 charged on the party. They\r\ndispersed, threw away their arms, and fled to the mountains; seven men only\r\nremaining with Lopez, and a large number being overtaken and killed. Lopez\r\nwas taken with six of his men in the _Pinos de Rangel_; his captors were\r\nJose Antonio Castaneda, guide of a pursuing force, and fifteen peasants of\r\nthe country. The capture took place on the 29th, just seventeen days from\r\nhis landing. The news of it spread at once through the country, and people\r\nbegan to flock into the camp to see the prisoners; to avoid inconvenience,\r\nCol. Ramon de Lago, who commanded the column, conveyed them to Havana by a\r\nnight march.\r\n\r\nThe second day after being separated from Lopez, the party under Colonel\r\nCrittenden was captured by a detachment of Spanish soldiers and carried\r\ninto Havana, where, on the sixteenth of August they were shot, by order of\r\nthe Captain General. Very much exaggerated accounts of the circumstances\r\nattending their execution were circulated in the United States; and by\r\nforged letters respecting successes by the invaders, adhesions to them by\r\nthe people of the island, indignities to Americans, &c., it was sought to\r\nexcite the public indignation so that further expeditions should be set on\r\nfoot that would be altogether irresistible. The party whose managements\r\nconsisted of such systematic and persevering falsehood lost all its energy\r\nwhen news came of the capture of Lopez and the remnants of his army. At\r\nseven o'clock on the morning of the first of September, Lopez was\r\n_garroted_--that being the Spanish punishment for treason--in the presence\r\nof from eight to ten thousand troops. Brought from the prison he ascended\r\nthe platform with a firm and steady step. Facing the multitude he made a\r\nshort speech, and his last words were, \"I die for my beloved Cuba.\" He then\r\ntook his seat--the machine was adjusted; at the first twist of the screw\r\nhis head dropped forward--and he was dead. He was a brave man, but of\r\nfeeble capacities, and the leading members of the Cuban junta in the United\r\nStates had no confidence in any movements subject to his direction. A few\r\nof the prisoners taken about the time of the capture of Lopez have been set\r\nat liberty, and others have been transported to Spain. The result of the\r\nwhole business shows that the bodies of the prisoners shot at Havana with\r\nCrittenden and Kerr, were not mutilated nor anywise maltreated, as had been\r\nstated, but that the story that they had been was fabricated to excite\r\nindignation and procure reinforcements in this country; that the invaders\r\nachieved no important success at any time, beyond the killing of General\r\nEnna and the consequent repulse of the detachment led by him; that they\r\nkilled not more than two hundred of the Spaniards; that they at no time\r\nwere able to act on the offensive, but fought for their lives from the\r\nfirst, and were at length surprised and utterly routed; that, though they\r\nwere landed in the very quarter of Cuba where Lopez was most likely to\r\nobtain aid, yet they received none of any kind, and were not joined by a\r\nsingle corporal's guard from the hour of their setting foot on the soil of\r\nCuba; that the Creoles, or natives of Cuba, so far from affording them such\r\naid as even cowards friendly to them might safely have done, evinced the\r\nmost active and deadly hostility throughout to the invaders and their\r\ncause. We cannot doubt that they furnished the information which led to the\r\nsurprise and route of Lopez; we know that they finally deceived, betrayed,\r\nbound and delivered him to Concha.\r\n\r\nThe CANADIAN PARLIAMENT was prorogued by the Governor-General on Saturday,\r\nthe 30th of August, to the 8th of October. The royal speech represents the\r\nrevenue as in a satisfactory state, and refers to the grants for improving\r\nthe navigation of the St. Lawrence, and to the reduction of the emigrant\r\ntax. Six bills were reserved for the approval of the Queen, three of which\r\nrelate to churches and rectories, two to the reduction of salaries, and one\r\nto the incorporation of the Fort Erie and Buffalo Suspension Bridge\r\nCompany. The reciprocity question was left unsettled. The paraphernalia of\r\nthe Canadian Government has since been removed from Toronto to Quebec. The\r\ngeneral election in the Province of Nova-Scotia for members of Parliament,\r\nhas resulted in a majority for the existing Government. The Provincial\r\nSecretary, the Attorney-General, the Financial Secretary, leading members\r\nof the Cabinet, have been reelected. The construction of the railway from\r\nHalifax to Portland, and through New-Brunswick to Quebec, may be considered\r\nas secured. The question has been one of the prominent points in the\r\nelection--the Liberals being in favor of, and the Conservatives opposed to\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe Mexican Congress have passed a bill for the formation of an alliance,\r\noffensive and defensive, between all the Spanish American republics. With a\r\nforeign debt beyond her ability to pay; with a deficit accruing every year;\r\nwith a whig government, threatened by insurrection at home, and blockade\r\nfrom a foreign power, Mexico may well look around her for some method of\r\nprolonging her existence. Opposition continues to the Tehuantepec treaty;\r\nand it is stated that two vessels sent from New-Orleans to commence the\r\ncanal were seized by the Mexican authorities.\r\n\r\nIn SOUTH AMERICA there has been more than the usual amount of revolution.\r\nThe President of Ecuador, General Nueva, left Querto on the seventeenth of\r\nJuly, to visit his family at Guayaquil. On approaching the city he was met\r\nby a military cavalcade, apparently for the purpose of escorting him in:\r\nbut was seized by them, and hurried off to sea in a vessel lying in the\r\nriver; the destination of the vessel, and the fate of the prisoner were\r\nunknown. General Urbina immediately entered upon the administration of\r\naffairs. In Chili, Don Manuel Montt has been elected President by a large\r\nmajority. Advices from Montevideo to July thirtieth, state that Urguiza and\r\nGarzon passed the Uraguay on the twentieth with seven thousand five hundred\r\nmen, and that General Servando Gomez at once went over to them from the\r\narmy of Oribe with two thousand cavalry, some staff officers and one\r\nthousand extra horses. It is expected that all of Oribe's forces will\r\ndesert him in the same manner. Garzon, who formerly served with Oribe, is\r\nvery popular among his forces. A Brazilian army of twelve thousand men is\r\nmarching to join Urguiza and Garzon. The war will now be carried into the\r\nterritories of Buenos Ayres. It will doubtless be a most ferocious contest;\r\nwith Rosas it is a matter of life and death; the power he has built up with\r\nsuch bloodshed and tyranny will either be destroyed utterly or confirmed by\r\nthe result. In Peru, the best understanding is said to exist between the\r\nLegislative and Executive bodies in the Government. Movements are being\r\nmade for the greater extension of freedom of trade, and for prohibiting the\r\ncirculation of Bolivian money within the Republic.\r\n\r\nA revolution has broken out in the provinces of Antiochia and Popayan, in\r\nNew-Grenada, which at the last advices (July twenty-fourth), was rapidly\r\nspreading over the country. The rising is headed by General Borrero, who\r\ntook up arms with one thousand men, and has since received large accessions\r\nto his forces. General Borrero has the reputation of being an accomplished\r\nsoldier and a sincere patriot. The city of Carthagena was thrown into great\r\nconfusion by the reception of the intelligence, the militia being called\r\nout and the people supplied with arms.\r\n\r\nIn Nicaragua a revolution has displaced the government, and M. Montenegro,\r\nwho was elected successor of the deposed President, died in a few days\r\nafter, and the chief of the opposite faction, General Munos, is probably\r\nnow in authority.\r\n\r\nFrom GREAT BRITAIN the news is various but generally of small importance.\r\nThe Queen and Royal Family have been making a tour in Scotland, which gave\r\noccasion to the usual rejoicings and demonstrations of loyalty. The most\r\ngrave questions discussed in the journals are connected with the Roman\r\nCatholic Disabilities subject. On the 19th August a great gathering of the\r\nRoman Catholic clergy and laity took place at the Rotunda in Dublin. The\r\nobject in view was the organization of a party and the commencement of an\r\nagitation to bring about the repeal of the obnoxious act of Parliament. So\r\nstrongly was public feeling excited on the occasion, that the military and\r\npolice forces were held in readiness for action. Fortunately the peace was\r\nnot disturbed; although the spiritual leaders themselves boldly set the law\r\nat defiance by the use, in one of their resolutions, of the very titles\r\nprohibited by the recent enactment. Among the notices of motion that have\r\nbeen placed on the books of the House of Commons for \"next session,\" is one\r\nby Mr. Hume to move that \"after a day to be fixed by Parliament, no person,\r\nmale or female, shall be admitted to the service of the public, in any\r\npermanent civil office or department, unless they shall pass an examination\r\nby competent persons appointed for that purpose, and shall be found capable\r\nof fluently reading and writing the English language\". In England the\r\nRailway Companies have held their annual meetings. The increase of travel\r\nhas not kept pace with the increase of railways; the average profit is 3\r\nper cent. The _Times_ has had some forcible articles recently on the\r\npossibility of running a railroad straight from London to Constantinople,\r\nand thence through Ask Minor to India, so as to make Calcutta accessible in\r\nseven days. This the _Times_ describes not only as practicable, but even of\r\nprobable accomplishment, in a given number of years.\r\n\r\nThe harvest in England, Scotland, and Ireland has been of the most\r\ngratifying description. The weather was generally favorable, and a large\r\nquantity of grain was secured in excellent condition. As the harvest\r\nproceeded the reports from the agricultural districts improved, and\r\nprevious estimates of crops, both as to quantity and quality, under rather\r\nthan over what is realised. The aggregate produce of the kingdom is\r\nexpected to be fully equal to that of good average seasons. Accounts of the\r\npotato blight have been greatly exaggerated. The disease has no doubt\r\nreappeared, but in much less degree than at the corresponding time in any\r\nprevious year since its first appearance. But notwithstanding the prospect\r\nof a good harvest, the tide of emigration continues to roll on as\r\nunceasingly as in the spring months. Day after day the journals chronicle\r\nthe departure of hundreds of emigrants, the major portion of whom are\r\nrepresented as possessing sufficient capital to enable them to purchase\r\nland on their arrival in America. The Monaghan Standard remarks that the\r\ngreater proportion of emigrants now are of a very different description\r\nfrom the hordes of unhappy creatures, poverty stricken and debilitated with\r\ndisease, who formerly struggled across the Atlantic. The greater number of\r\nthose who now crowd our emigrant ships are men who, with a capital varying\r\nfrom L100 to L300, have been in the habit of conducting, with the aid of\r\ntheir sons and daughters, the cultivation of their land. An honorable trait\r\nof the character of the Irish in America is shown in a fact stated in the\r\n_Ballinesloe Star_, that in six weeks upwards of L20,000 were received from\r\nrelations in America, in sums varying from L5 to L30, by persons in\r\nIreland, the great majority of whom had been receiving relief in the\r\nwork-houses up to the time of the money reaching them. In many cases the\r\npoor people have kept the matter secret, through a mistaken fear that if it\r\nwere known to the poor law officials, a portion of the money would be\r\nimpounded to pay for their maintainance while in the work-house. The money\r\nis consigned to some third party--some shopkeeper, or person who could be\r\ndepended upon, to have it safely conveyed to its intended destination,\r\nwithout the knowledge of the work-house officers.\r\n\r\nMuch excitement has been created in England by a match between the yacht\r\nAmerica, owned by Mr. John C. Stevens, of New-York, and the yacht Titania,\r\nand by other matches between the America and the most celebrated yachts in\r\nEngland, in all of which the America was successful.\r\n\r\nThe America arrived out early in July. Hitherto the dozen or more yacht\r\nclubs in the United Kingdom had never dreamed of foreign competition. It\r\nwas just known that there was an Imperial Yacht Club of St. Petersburg,\r\nmaintained to encourage a nautical spirit among the nobility; and that\r\nowners of yachts at Rotterdam had enrolled themselves as the \"Royal\r\nNetherlands Yacht Club;\" but, till the America appeared, the few who were\r\naware of the fact that there was a flourishing club at New York did not\r\nregard it as of the slightest consequence, or as at all likely to interfere\r\nwith their monopoly of the most useful of sports. The few trial runs the\r\nAmerica made after her arrival proved she was possessed of great speed, and\r\nthat the owners were not so little justified as at first they had been\r\nthought in offering to back an untried vessel against any yacht in the\r\nEnglish waters for the large sum of L10,000. As the day of the Royal\r\nSquadron's grand match drew near, the entries became numerous. In the\r\nmemory of man Cowes never presented such an appearance as on the 22d of\r\nAugust. A large portion of the peerage and gentry of the United Kingdom had\r\nleft their residences, and forsaken the sports of the moors, to witness the\r\nstruggle. There must have been a hundred yachts lying at anchor in the\r\nroads; the beach was crowded, from Egypt to the piers; the esplanade in\r\nfront of the Club thronged with ladies and gentlemen, and with the people\r\ninland, who came over in shoals, with wives, sons, and daughters, for the\r\nday. Eighteen yachts entered as competitors; the largest of which was a\r\nthree-mast schooner, the Brilliant, 392 tons; and the smallest a cutter,\r\nVolante, 48 tons. Nine of the yachts were of above 100 tons, and nine were\r\nof less than 100 tons. The America's burden is 170 tons. The umpire in the\r\ncase was Earl Wilton, and the triumph of the America complete. The \"Cup of\r\nAll Nations\" was presented to Commodore Stephens and his brother, the\r\nowners of the America, after a dinner in the club-house that night. Mr.\r\nAbbot Lawrence was present, and acknowledged the compliments paid to this\r\ncountry. The yacht has since been sold to an English gentleman,--to be a\r\nmodel for British naval architects.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE YACHT \"AMERICA\"]\r\n\r\nIn the American section of the Great Exhibition, Mr. Hobbs has been the\r\ngreat centre of attraction, and his colloquial powers have been severely\r\ntested by the thousand and one explanations he is obliged to give of the\r\nmode in which his late achievements were effected. He contents himself\r\nwith asserting the vulnerability of all British locks and the\r\nimpregnability of his own. He looks on the picking of Chubb's locks as the\r\nsmallest of his feats; and it appears that the Directors of the Bank of\r\nEngland (no bad judges in such matters), have given in their adhesion, by\r\nordering several of Mr. Hobbs's patent locks.\r\n\r\n\"Every practical success of the season,\" says the _Times_, \"belongs to the\r\nAmericans.\" Their reaping machines, their revolvers, their yachts, are\r\ngreat \"facts,\" and every one in England seems willing to admire the skill\r\nand enterprise that produced them. Narrow-minded critics, who are too wise\r\nto learn, find out that the reasons for the \"America's\" success were\r\nexceedingly trifling; it was only a difference in her build, and in the\r\nconstruction of the sails, &c. Precisely so, and it was only a stroke with\r\na knife that enabled the egg of Columbus (which it is true must be stale by\r\nthis time) to stand perpendicular. Every one can do it _now_, just as with\r\nthe aid of fire and coals, and some water, they can rush from continent to\r\ncontinent, and baffle the wind or the waves. Every discovery that is useful\r\nis simple. In the works of nature, there is no perplexing machinery.\r\n\r\nThe war at the Cape of Good Hope, still threatens to be expensive and\r\nprotracted. The British troops have shown great gallantry in action, and\r\nthe greatest endurance and even cheerfulness under the severe fatigue\r\ninseparable from the nature of the country, and the wide range embraced by\r\nthe operations. But they are few in number; the policy of the insurgents is\r\nto avoid as much as possible a general engagement; the frontier is too\r\nextended to be effectually protected by stationary posts; the troops,\r\ntherefore, are necessarily harrassed by constant patrol duty, and with no\r\nmore decisive result than an occasional skirmish, in which four, five, or\r\nsix Caffres are put _hors de combat_.\r\n\r\nThe directors of the Manchester Commercial Association, and of the Chamber\r\nof Commerce, continue to prosecute their endeavors to encourage the\r\ncultivation of cotton in India. In the early part of this year, letters\r\nwere received by the association that fresh New-Orleans cotton seed was\r\nscarce in the districts of Tinnivelly and Coimbetore, and other parts of\r\nthe Madras territory; and fearing that the India Board, if appealed to,\r\nmight not be sufficiently prompt in supplying that deficiency. Mr. John\r\nPeal, one of the members of the association, has imported at his own risk\r\nthirty tons of this seed, and placed it at the disposal of the Court of\r\nDirectors.\r\n\r\nA California has been discovered in an interior county of New South Wales.\r\nThe _Sydney Morning Herald_ of May 20, quotes from the _Bathurst Free\r\nPress_ of a few days previous, an article which describes \"a tremendous\r\nexcitement\" in the town of Bathurst and the surrounding district of the\r\ncounties Bathurst, Roxburg, and Westmoreland, on the discovery that \"the\r\ncountry from the mountain ranges to an indefinite extent in the interior is\r\none immense gold field.\"\r\n\r\nIn India the British government has derided to take and keep possession of\r\ncertain parts of the Nizam's dominions unless he repays at once the monies\r\ndue to the Government of India, amounting to upwards of eighty lacs of\r\nrupees, with interest at six per cent. The districts of country about to be\r\nabsorbed are, it is said, all those on the other side of the Kishna river,\r\nBachore, and Neildroog, besides Berar. But it is considered in Bombay that\r\nthe Nizam \"has the means to pay,\" and that at the eleventh hour he will pay\r\nand save his territory.\r\n\r\nTraces appear to have been discovered of the movements of Sir John\r\nFranklin, in the earlier part of his voyage, but throwing little light, as\r\nwe apprehend, on the painful question of his subsequent fate--of little\r\nmore importance, in fact, than would be the vestiges he may have left\r\nbehind him in Scotland. Yet we doubt whether it would be justifiable to\r\nabandon the pursuit, until their fate has been demonstrated by actual\r\nobservation. This melancholy satisfaction, at least, is due to science, to\r\nhumanity, and to surviving relatives. The Americans are foremost in this\r\nwork of philanthropy. They have furnished the latest and most valuable\r\ninformation on the subject. Captain de Haven, Mr. Penny, and Dr. Kane, of\r\nthe United States expedition, are especially entitled, with the officers\r\nand crews of their ships, to general admiration.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st August, a large party of the Corporation of London, and of the\r\nRoyal Commissioners of the Great Exhibition, repaired to Paris, by\r\ninvitation of the Prefect of the Seine. They were entertained on the way,\r\nand on August 2, a magnificent banquet was given at the Hotel de Ville in\r\nParis, followed by a comedy and a concert. The total number of persons\r\npresent was 4,000. The next day, Sunday, the wonders of Versailles and the\r\n_grandes eaux_ were exhibited, and it is supposed that 100,000 persons were\r\npresent. On Monday, the Lord Mayor and his suite, with the other\r\ndistinguished visitors, inspected some of the most remarkable prisons in\r\nParis, and in the afternoon left for St. Cloud, where they were received by\r\nthe President, who expressed the extreme happiness he derived from the\r\nvisit of the chief magistrate of the city of London, and his warm sense of\r\nthe kind feeling towards France; manifested by the English nation. On\r\nTuesday, a splende _dejeuner_ was given at the English Embassy, in honor of\r\nthe English visitors; and in the evening a grand ball took place at the\r\nHotel de Ville, which was attended by 6000 persons. On Wednesday a mimic\r\nfight took place in the Champ de Mars; and in the evening, at the Grand\r\nOpera, an operatic entertainment was produced called _Les Nations_, written\r\nexpressly in honor of Great Britain, by M. Adolpbe Adam. It was a tasteful\r\nand well-imagined trifle, of two scenes, the principal being one of the\r\nCrystal Palace.\r\n\r\nFrom FRANCE the political news is of little moment, or at least is without\r\nany distinguishing event. The project for a revision of the constitution\r\nhaving failed, all parties are preparing for the important event of\r\nelecting a new President. The Prince Joinville may be considered to be in\r\nthe field as the representative of the Bourbon dynasty; and it is probable\r\nthat the real conflict will be fought between the adherents of Napoleon and\r\nthose of the exiled monarchy. A majority of the Councils of\r\nArrondissement--according to some, a majority of no less than two\r\nthirds--have decided against any revision of the Constitution. At Lyons a\r\nconspiracy against the state was discovered, its leaders arrested, and\r\ntheir trial has excited much attention. Their object it is said was to give\r\nthe south-eastern departments of France a secret organization,\r\nsufficiently strong and complete to enable them to break out in\r\nsimultaneous insurrection on a given signal; to secure the frontier of\r\nSwitzerland and of Savoy as a means of assistance or retreat; to support\r\nthe French movement by the advance of the refugees collected at Geneva; to\r\ntake possession, if possible, of the ports of Toulon and Marseilles, and\r\nthus to command Algiers and the fleet; to inflame by this insurrection the\r\nsouth-eastern provinces pledged to the movement, and subsequently the\r\neastern departments supposed to be favorable to it; and thus to lead to a\r\ngeneral republican rising throughout the country, especially where the\r\ngarrisons--were weakest. The prisoners were tried by a council of war, and\r\ntheir council in the course of the trial threw up their briefs in despair\r\nof obtaining a fair inquisition. Three of the prisoners, M. Gent, their\r\nleader, who had been conspicuous in affairs during the provisional\r\ngovernment, and Longomazino, and Ode--were condemned to deportation;\r\nthirteen to detention for terms from three to fifteen years as felons, with\r\npolice surveillance for life; nine to imprisonment for short terms; eleven\r\nwere acquitted, besides ten who were condemned, and two acquitted by\r\ndefault. The punishment of deportation is the highest penalty for political\r\noffences now known to the French law, and has been expressly substituted by\r\na recent enactment for the punishment of death. It consists in\r\ntransportation to Nonkahiva or Vuitkan, in the Marquesas, the most desolate\r\nislands in the Pacific Ocean, one day to be peopled, as an enterprising\r\npublic writer has observed, with the chiefs and leaders of political\r\nparties in France. At Paris, on the 31st of August, 125 persous were\r\narrested, charged with a conspiracy against the State. Among the number was\r\nan advocate, named Maillard, formerly Secretary to Ledru Rollin. Rollin is\r\nsaid to be implicated in the conspiracy. A general Socialist Revolution was\r\nthe object of the conspiracy. There was less excitement upon the subject in\r\nParis than might have been anticipated. It is reported that an expedition\r\nwill be sent to the Sea of Japan, under the orders of a rear-admiral, who\r\nhas long navigated in the Pacific Ocean and the Chinese seas. The\r\nexpedition will, it is added, be at once military, commercial and\r\nscientific, and has for its object the opening to European commerce of\r\nports which have been closed against it since the sixteenth century.\r\n\r\nWe learn from Paris, that the Cabinet had held two councils, at which the\r\nPresident of the Republic presided, to discuss the Cuban affairs, and it\r\nwas unanimously resolved to take, if necessary, efficient measures, with or\r\nwithout the concurrence of England, to protect the rights of Spain.\r\n\r\nLetters from Toulon state that the Mediterranean squadron has received\r\norders to proceed forthwith to the coast of Italy. The disturbed state of\r\nthe Peninsula, and especially of Naples, is said to be the cause of this\r\nmovement on the part of the French. Naples, and indeed all Italy, is\r\nbecoming daily more and more uneasy.\r\n\r\nIn ITALY there is little of importance, except constant atrocities by the\r\ngovernment, irritating more and more the people of the several states, and\r\ndriving them toward such excitements as will make revolution unavoidable.\r\nAn \"Italian League of Princes\" is talked of, at the head of which is to be\r\nAustria; and a visit of the Cardinal Prince Altieri to Lombardy is said to\r\nbe for the purpose of coming to an understanding with that Court on the\r\nsubject. The Pope would be nominal president of the league, the object of\r\nwhich is to preserve the peace of Italy, and unite in suppressing every\r\nrevolutionary movement at home, and aggression from abroad. A profound\r\nsensation has been created throughout Europe by the publication of two\r\nletters by Mr. Gladstone, a member of the British Parliament, exposing the\r\ndespotism of the government of Naples. Mr. Gladstone, a scholar, a man of\r\nacademic reputation, an eminent member of the conservative party of English\r\npoliticians, and distinguished among members of that party for his calm and\r\nlogical mind, and for his profound views of the nature and functions of a\r\nchurch--this man went to Italy in the winter of 1850-51, and spent three\r\nmonths in Naples, where, against his will, he was convinced that the\r\nconduct of the government was more cruel and unjust than had ever before\r\nbeen tolerated in a civilized country. He returned to England to arraign\r\nthe despot Ferdinand at the bar of public opinion. Of his disclosures we\r\ncan merely state, that twenty thousand of the most intelligent and virtuous\r\nmen in that kingdom are now suffering both moral and physical torture as\r\nprisoners of state. Besides this, a catechism is used in the schools\r\ninculcating the most absolute doctrines of despotic government. What is\r\nthus proved of Naples is equally true of Modena. In fact, it pervades\r\nItaly. The organs of the Neapolitan Government give the lie to Mr.\r\nGladstone's statements, and hirelings have been employed in London and\r\nParis to answer them, but the result has been a triumphant vindication of\r\nhis letters.\r\n\r\nThe correspondent of the _Daily News_, at Naples, states that more than one\r\nof the hangers-on of the Neapolitan Court have offered to reply to Mr.\r\nGladstone's Setters, and n notorious spy has sent a manuscript to his\r\nMajesty: but \"the King, I am assured, prefers availing himself of such\r\njournals in England or France as are open to an offer.\" Material has been\r\nsent off to the _Univers_, the organ of the Jesuits in France; and \"an\r\nEnglishman, well known for certain transactions in Italy, is to do all the\r\npen fighting work for Ferdinand in London. Really,\" says the _Daily News_,\r\n\"the princes of this epoch have much to redeem. Almost every crowned, or\r\nwould-be crowned, head, as he appears on the scene, does so as a mean\r\nintriguer, a lying varlet, a wearer of false colors. None have the courage\r\nto avow the nature of their policy or claims; all pretending to be all\r\nthings, and all as unscrupulous as the most reckless of adventurers in\r\nprivate life.\"\r\n\r\nThe Voss Gazette of Berlin, publishes a letter from Vienna of the 7th,\r\nwhich states that an extensive conspiracy has been discovered in Italy, and\r\nit was on that account the rigors of the state of siege in the Austrian\r\nprovinces have been increased. It is added that on the fourth of July a\r\ngentleman at Venice died suddenly of apoplexy, and that on placing seals on\r\nhis papers the scheme of a conspiracy, signed by more than 400 persons, was\r\ndiscovered. The object of it was, it is said, to kill the Emperor in the\r\nevent of his going to Italy, and to kill all Austrian officers on the same\r\nnight. Only one conspirator resided at Venice; thirty-seven were at\r\nBrescia, and the rest at Bologna. All have, it is said, been arrested.\r\n\r\nThere is considerable activity among the military in ITALY. The Austrian\r\ngarrison and stations are strengthened along the whole line of frontier,\r\nespecially towards Piedmont. Radetzky is understood to have applied for\r\nreinforcements from Germany. Connected with these movements--perhaps\r\narising out of them--are numerous but rather vague reports of plots and\r\ncontemplated insurrections. The Court of Saxony, long notorious for its\r\nzeal in propagating the Roman Catholic faith, has offered to mediate\r\nbetween the King of Sardinia and the Pope. The intimate family relations\r\nwhich connect the Courts of Saxony and Turin have prompted this step: it\r\nappears to be contemplated not without alarm by the Italian Liberals.\r\n\r\nGreat excitement has been created throughout Europe, by the promulgation of\r\nthe two decrees of the Emperor of AUSTRIA, in which he declares that his\r\nministers are henceforth to be responsible to no other political authority\r\nthan the throne. The very terms of the Constitutional Government are\r\nabolished. The Emperor has violently suppressed the \"Free Congregations,\"\r\nestablished by Ronge, and that once popular reformer has published some\r\nmasterly letters on the subject, calling on the people of England to give\r\nthe aid of their sympathy to the liberal thinkers of Germany. The Austrian\r\nGovernment has summarily expelled from its dominions Mr. Warrens, late\r\nConsul-General of the United States at Vienna, and for the last few years\r\nthe proprietor of the widely-known newspaper, _The Lloyds_. The cause\r\nassigned is the publication of some unpalatable political remarks. This\r\ncircumstance, coupled with the late bad treatment of Mr. Brace, will\r\nembitter our diplomatic relations with Austria.\r\n\r\nFrom RUSSIA information as to the war in its Caucasian departments is\r\nindefinite and uncertain. There had been several conflicts but none\r\ndecisive or very important.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor of Russia has declared himself hostile to the incorporation of\r\nthe non-German territories of Austria into the Germanic Confederation. This\r\nwould seem to indicate that the Autocrat still clings to his project of a\r\nPanaslavonic union.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of July, several prisoners, detained in the citadel at\r\nWarsaw, were condemned by Court Martial, and had their sentences\r\ncommunicated to them. The families of these unfortunates expected to obtain\r\ntheir pardon from the Emperor during his stay in Warsaw, or at all events\r\nduring the celebration at Moscow on the 25th anniversary of his coronation,\r\nbut they had hoped in vain. On the 20th of July, four of the convicted were\r\npublicly flogged. One received 2,000 lashes, two 1,500 each, and the fourth\r\n2,000. This last fell dead after having received 1,000 lashes, and they\r\nplaced the body of the dying man on a stretcher, where they administered\r\nthe remaining thousand to his corpse. Thirty others, of whom the greater\r\npart were entitled to the amnesty granted to refugees, were sent to\r\nSiberia.\r\n\r\nThe census for Hungary, recently published in Austria, gives the following\r\nstatistics: The collective mass of the native population is given at\r\n7,659,151 souls. Of these there are 3,782,627 males, 3,876,624 females.\r\nThese again are divided into 2,090,459 unmarried males, 1,943,946 unmarried\r\nfemales; 1,580,465 married males, 1,588,772 married females. One of the\r\nconsequences of the civil war is to be found in the fact, that there are\r\n134,113 more widows than bereaved males! The following is an estimate of\r\nthe polyglott population--Magyars, 3,749,652--Sclavonians or Sclaves,\r\n8,656,311--Germans, 834,350--Romanis, 538,373--Ruthenians, 347,734--Jews,\r\n23,564--Croats, 82,003--Wends, 49,116--Gipsies, 47,609--Serfs, 20,994.\r\nOther nationalities, made up of Illyrians, Moravians, Bohemians, Italians,\r\nArmenians, Poles, 81 French, 25 English, 12 Swiss, and 2 Belgian, in all,\r\n9,435. These classified according to religion, show of--Roman Catholics,\r\n4,122,738--Greek Catholics, 676,398--Protestants of both confessions,\r\n2,139,520--Greek not united, 396,931.\r\n\r\nRevolution appears to be making the tour of the globe. Even the supposed\r\nunchangeable China is visited by the spirit of mutability. According to the\r\nlatest intelligence, it is highly probable that the malcontents, who have\r\nbeen variously represented as brigands and rebels, are masters of all the\r\nprovinces south of the Yellow River, and have seized upon the great\r\nentrepot of Canton. This would be a revolution; for Pekin, which derives\r\nits supplies of provisions by the great canal from those Southern\r\nprovinces, would be starved into submission; and the principal seat of\r\nforeign commerce would fall into the hands of a party more bigotedly\r\nhostile to intercourse with foreigners than even the Celestial Government.\r\nNor is such a revolution either impossible or improbable. Our knowledge of\r\nChinese history is dim and obscure; yet enough appears to show that the\r\nMantchoo authority has never been so firmly established to the South as to\r\nthe North of the Yellow River--that the purely Chinese element of society\r\nhas always preponderated in the Southern provinces. The pretended Emperor,\r\nat the last dates, was reported to be stopping at Sinchau, a departmental\r\ncity of Kwang-si, having a water communication with Canton, whence it is\r\ndistant about 200 miles. In a letter from one of his followers, it is\r\nstated that Teen-teh is himself at the head of the rebel forces, whom he\r\nled to victory \"in the middle term of the third month of the present year\"\r\n(early in June), \"when 10,000 of the Government troops were destroyed,\r\nbeing hemmed in in a narrow pathway through a wood in a mountain pass.\"\r\nHaving been duly proclaimed Emperor, Teen-teh dates the commencement of his\r\nreign from the month of September of last year, and has published an\r\nalmanac, which his emissaries are busy distributing in various parts of the\r\nempire.\r\n\r\nIn SIAM two changes of policy appear to be impending. The King, who refused\r\nto treat with Sir James Brooke, died on the 3d of April, and his throne is\r\nnow occupied by two of his brothers; the eldest being first, and the other\r\nsecond king. This division of authority is not without precedent in Siam,\r\nand has taken place in the present instance in accordance with a legal\r\nnomination, made by the late King. There is little doubt but that for the\r\nfuture a different and more enlightened course of policy will be pursued\r\ntowards foreigners. The new ruler-in-chief is a man of more than usual\r\neducation, speaking English, and being somewhat acquainted with literature\r\nand science, and he has stated that if the English and American ambassadors\r\nreturn, they will be kindly received, and liberal treaties negotiated with\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Scientific Discoveries and Proceedings of Learned Societies._\r\n\r\n\r\nAt a recent meeting of the _Royal Society of Literature_, Colonel Rawlinson\r\nread a most interesting paper, containing the announcement of a discovery\r\nof great historical importance. In looking over the large collection of new\r\ncuneiform inscriptions recently brought by Mr. Layard from Assyria, he has\r\nmet with one recording the annals of the \"Koyunjik King.\" Under the head of\r\nthe third year occurs a notice which determinately proves the king in\r\nquestion to be the biblical Senacherib, and contains some other remarkable\r\nverifications of Scripture. The record, after giving an account of the\r\nking's war against the king of Sidon, and describing the battle between the\r\nAssyrians and Egyptians, in conformity with the statements of Josephus and\r\nHerodotus, presents a distinct notice of the proceedings of Senacherib\r\nagainst Hezekiah, king of Judea. The names in the inscription are\r\n_Khazakiyah_, _Ursalimma_, _Jehuda_; and the tribute which the Jewish king\r\npays, in order to free himself from his enemy, is stated almost in the very\r\nwords of Scripture. The annals of Senacherib in this inscription extend\r\nover seven years, and a cylinder has been met with which gives the events\r\nof two years more. Other points of identity between these annals and the\r\nGreek and the biblical notices of Senacherib likewise occur; but the chief\r\npoint of interest is the establishment of the identity of the king who\r\nbuilt the great palace of Koyunjik with that sovereign. A secure\r\nstarting-place is now obtained for historical research, and it rapid\r\nprogress will be made in fixing the Assyrian chronology. Colonel\r\nRawlinson's paper was read at one of the four evening meetings which the\r\nSociety has held this season for the reception of its foreign members and\r\nfriends. The Earl of Carlisle was in the chair.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAttempts to discover a PERPETUAL MOTION are still made in almost every\r\ncountry. In the United States a successful result is attained, according to\r\nthe newspapers, about twice a year, and in Europe the inventive genius of\r\nthe people is nearly as well rewarded. We read in the French paper\r\nappearing in Constantinople, that a Polish refugee of the name of Rudinski\r\nhas discovered a sort of _perpetuum mobile_, at least an engine which\r\nsomewhat approaches perpetual motion, for when once put in motion it can\r\npreserve it for twenty years. The power of this engine is said to be\r\ngreater than that of any other yet known. The article in the same paper\r\nsays that the inventor has made as a model a small carriage, 22 inches\r\nlong, 11 inches wide and 14 inches high; that it carries a burden of one\r\nton; and that its speed is a mile in a minute. The inventor is now occupied\r\nin building a mill after his method for the Turkish Government. The last\r\nAmerican effort in this line is a \"Static Pressure Rotary Engine,\"\r\nadvertised by a Mr. Sawyer, and vindicated by Mr. Andrews, in a series of\r\nletters in the Tribune. Professor Loomis, of the New-York University, has\r\ntaken the trouble to show that there is no discovery in the case. Mr.\r\nSawyer's machine consist a of a covered cylindrical basin, 26 inches in\r\ndiameter and two inches deep, to which is attached a vertical tube four\r\ninches in diameter and of any required length. A spiral groove runs the\r\nwhole length of the tube, and this, together with the basin, is supposed to\r\nbe filled with quicksilver. The whole is to be rapidly revolved about a\r\nvertical axis, when the centrifugal force of the mercury in the basin\r\ndrives the mercury out through a valve on the edge of the basin, and leaves\r\na vacuum behind. The mercury, as it escapes from the basin, falls into a\r\nreservoir communicating with the bottom of the spiral groove, through which\r\nit is forced by the pressure of the atmosphere with such velocity that the\r\nreaction of the sides of the groove causes the tube and the attached basin\r\nto revolve with great momentum, evolving new centrifugal force by which the\r\nvacuum is perpetuated. Mr. Sawyer supposes that the centrifugal force of\r\nthe revolving mercury is sufficient to maintain its own revolution\r\nunimpaired, and leave a large surplus capable of being applied to any\r\nuseful purpose. This conclusion is founded upon the computations of\r\nProfessor Bull. Professor Bull has computed that a wheel 16 inches in\r\ndiameter, and weighing 531 pounds, revolving 25 times in 10 seconds, will\r\nhave a centrifugal force of 2,716 pounds; and that this velocity may be\r\nproduced by a power of 166 pounds applied 1-1/2 inches from the centre, or\r\na power of 452 pounds acting on the spiral groove already mentioned. Hence,\r\nsays Mr. Sawyer, we have \"a clear surplus of 2,264 pounds more than is\r\nrequired to turn the wheel.\" If this were so, it would constitute the most\r\nbeautiful perpetual motion ever dreamed of by the visionary. Professor\r\nLoomis discusses the subject at length, and his chief objection may be\r\nsummed up as follows: According to Sawyer &, Co.'s own data, _the\r\ncentrifugal force of a revolving wheel exceeds the power required to\r\nproduce the rotation only at exceedingly high velocities--and in order to\r\navail themselves of the full extent of this centrifugal force, they must\r\nemploy air of such density that no vessel could possibly resist its\r\npressure_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the archives of Venice an interesting discovery has been made, from\r\nwhich it would appear that a Frenchman of the name of Gautier, professor of\r\nmathematics at Nancy, and member of the Royal Society at Paris, was the\r\nfirst to invent navigation by steam. In the year 1756 he submitted his plan\r\nto the society, of which he was a member, and it met with no countenance\r\nfrom that body. He then published a treatise on the subject, which\r\nattracted the attention of the Venetian Republic, and procured for him an\r\ninvitation to the shores of the Adriatic; he went, but death soon put an\r\nend to his labors. A year or two afterwards the theory of Gautier was\r\npractically exemplified on the Seine, amidst the acclamations of the\r\nParisians. The treatise by Gautier on \"Navigation by Fire\" the discovery\r\nalluded to above.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA paper was read before the British Association entitled \"A Comparison of\r\nAthletic Men of Great Britain with Greek Statues,\" by Mr. J. B. Brent. Mr.\r\nBrent, in order to obtain those of the athletic, measured and weighed\r\ncelebrated boxers, cricketers, wrestlers, rowers, pedestrians, and others.\r\nThese he compared to the heights and weights of soldiers and policemen,\r\nand thence with certain celebrated Greek statues. And from such a\r\ncomparison it appears that the wrestlers of Cornwall, Devon, and the north\r\nof England, are not inferior to those statues.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA letter from St. Petersburg says that the _Geographical Society_ of that\r\ncity is displaying great activity. \"Scarcely has the expedition which is\r\nsent to seek out the sources of the Nile returned when the society is\r\npreparing a new expedition having for its object to explore the peninsula\r\nof Kamskatka. The Count de Czapski is to have the direction of this new\r\nattempt, and he has subscribed 20,000f. a year towards the expense.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA recent traveller in Abyssinia has discovered a tribe of Jews in that\r\ncountry. They are called Falasha. Their chief priest, the Rabbi Yshaq\r\n(Isaac), told the traveller that they first entered the country in the time\r\nof King Solomon, and that they have uninterrupted traditions, though no\r\nwritten history, of the principal events that have occurred to them since\r\nthat remote period. Their religious rites and belief are the same in\r\nsubstance as those of the European Jews, but some of their doctrines are\r\nquasi-Christian. Indeed, they say that it was from them that the early\r\nChristians took some of their customs and points of belief. They have a\r\ntradition of St. Paul having been in communication with them, and they hold\r\nhim in great respect. They never, it seems, quitted their own country, and\r\nwere shocked at the idea of going to sea in ships. \"How at sea,\" they\r\nasked, \"can the Sabbath be respected?\" They know little or nothing of\r\nEurope; but on being told that vast numbers of their fellow believers\r\nresided in it, expressed pleasure and sent them their fraternal good\r\nwishes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA French gentleman, M. Mariette, has made some important discoveries in the\r\nruins of Memphis, and the _Academy of Moral and Political Sciences_ has\r\ncalled on the government to afford him the pecuniary means of continuing\r\nhis researches. The National Assembly, on the demand of the government,\r\nvoted 20,000 francs ($6,000) for this purpose. M. Mariette has brought to\r\nlight a number of basso-relievos, some statues, and about five hundred\r\nbronze figures. But his greatest discovery is the Temple of Serapis, and it\r\nis to free it from the soil which has covered it for ages that the money\r\nhas been specially granted. One of the most magnificent temples which this\r\ndeity possessed, or, indeed, which existed in the world, was that at\r\nMemphis; and it enjoys the peculiarity of containing ornaments in the\r\nGrecian as well as the Egyptian style, it having been in its highest glory\r\nabout the time at which some of the Grecian idolatry was introduced into\r\nthe ancient worship of Egypt. It is known to contain twelve statues of\r\ndeities mounted on symbolical animals, all of more gigantic size than any\r\nhitherto found, also two splendid figures of the Sphinx, and two enormous\r\nlions in the Egyptian style: but the Sanctuary of the Temple, which has not\r\nyet been explored, will, it is expected, bring to light things far more\r\ncurious, and of the highest historical importance. Altogether, it is\r\nexpected that M. Mariette's excavations at Memphis will rival those of Dr.\r\nLayard at Nineveh.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that an island, about 120 feet high and 2,000 feet in\r\ncircumference, suddenly sprang up in 1831 between Sicily and La\r\nPantellaria. It disappeared about a month after, and at a later period even\r\nthe sounding lead could give no indications of its existence; but vessels\r\npassing over the place it had formerly occupied would sometimes feel a sort\r\nof shock, which showed that it was of volcanic origin. In March last,\r\nhowever, the French vessel Eole, which was taking soundings in the\r\nvicinity, discovered some traces of its existence; and we now learn from\r\nNaples that in the course of the last month Her Majesty's ship Scourge,\r\nCaptain Kerr, verified the truth of the preceding observation, and further\r\ndiscovered that the island, which had been christened \"Isola Giulia,\" was\r\nonly nine feet under water. Captain Kerr had a pole with a streamer and an\r\ninscription set up on the spot.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe experiments for the production of PHOTOGRAPHS in NATURAL COLORS appears\r\nto have been carried on simultaneously by Mr. Hill in this country and by\r\nseveral persons abroad. The _Athenaeum_ says that in some experiments made\r\nby Sir John Herschel a colored impression of the prismatic spectrum was\r\nobtained on paper stained with a vegetable juice. Mr. Robert Hunt published\r\nsome accounts of the indications of color in their natural order obtained\r\non sensitive photographic surfaces. These were, however, exceedingly faint,\r\nand M. Biot and others regarded the prospect of producing photographs in\r\ncolors visionary,--not likely, from the dissimilar action of the solar\r\nrays, ever to become a reality. M. Becquerel has a process by which, on\r\nplates of metal, many of the more intense colors have been produced; but it\r\nappears to have been reserved for the nephew of the earliest student in\r\nphotography, Niepce, to produce on the same plate, by _one_ impression of\r\nthe solar rays, all the colors of the chromatic scale. Of this process,\r\ncalled by the discoverer, _Heliochromy_--sun-coloring--we have had the\r\nopportunity of seeing specimens. They are three copies of colored\r\nengravings,--a female dancer and two male figures in fancy costumes; and\r\nevery color of the original pictures is faithfully impressed on the\r\nprepared silver tablet. The preparation of the plates remains a secret with\r\nthe inventor, but the plate when prepared presents a dark brown, nearly a\r\nblack surface, and the image is _eaten out_ in colors. We have endeavored\r\nby close examination to ascertain something of the laws producing this\r\nremarkable effect; but it is not easy at present to perceive the relations\r\nbetween the colorific action of light and the associated chemical\r\ninfluence. The female figure has a red silk dress, with purple trimming and\r\nwhite lace. The flesh tints, the red, the purple, and the white are well\r\npreserved in the copy. One of the male figures s remarkable for the\r\ndelicacy of its delineation:--here, blue, red, white and pink are perfectly\r\nimpressed. The third picture is injured in some parts:-but it is, from the\r\nnumber of colors which contains, the most remarkable of all. Red, blue,\r\nyellow, green, and white are distinctly marked,--and the intensity of the\r\nyellow is very striking. Such are the facts as they have been examined by\r\nthe _Athenaeum_, and these results superior to those which were given to the\r\nworld when photography was first announced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Recent Deaths._\r\n\r\n\r\nJAMES FENIMORE COOPER, the first American who gave to American literature a\r\nname in other nations, and the most illustrious of the authors of his\r\ncountry, died at Otsego Hall, his residence in Cooperstown, on Sunday, the\r\nfourteenth of September, aged sixty-two years. Of his literary life and\r\ncharacter we have recently written at large in these pages; of his noble\r\npersonal qualities, which entitled him to no less eminence in society, we\r\nshall have occasion to speak hereafter.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nREV. THOMAS H. GALLAUDET, LL, D., the pioneer of Deaf-Mute Instruction in\r\nthis country, died in Hartford, Connecticut, the 10th of September, at the\r\nage of sixty-four. At an early period of his life, Mr. Gallaudet became\r\ninterested in the Deaf and Dumb. In the autumn of 1807, a child of Dr.\r\nMason F. Cogswell, of Hartford, through a malignant fever, lost her hearing\r\nand soon after her speech. Mr. Gallaudet interested himself in the case of\r\nthis child, and attempted to converse with and instruct her. His efforts\r\nwas rewarded with partial success; and through the exertions of Dr.\r\nCogswell, he was commissioned to visit Europe for the purpose of becoming a\r\nteacher of the Deaf and Dumb in this country. Seven gentlemen of Hartford\r\nsubscribed sufficient funds to defray his expenses, and he departed on the\r\n25th of May, 1815. Meanwhile, the friends of the project employed the\r\ninterval in procuring an incorporation from the Legislature, in May, 1816.\r\nIn May, 1819, the name of \"the American Asylum at Hartford for the\r\nEducation and Instruction of the Deaf and Dumb,\" was bestowed on the first\r\nInstitution for Deaf-Mutes established in this country. After spending\r\nseveral months in assiduous prosecution of his studies, under the Abbe\r\nSicard and others, Mr. Gallaudet returned in August, 1816, accompanied by\r\nMr. Laurent Clerc, a deaf and dumb professor of the Institution at Paris,\r\nwell known in Europe as a most intelligent pupil of Sicard. Mr. Clerc is\r\nnow living in a vigorous old age and is still a teacher at Hartford. The\r\nAsylum was opened on the 15th of April, 1817, and during the first week of\r\nits existence received seven pupils; it now averages 220 annually. Mr.\r\nGallaudet became the Principal at its commencement, and held the office\r\nuntil April, 1830, when he resigned, and he has since officiated as\r\nChaplain of the Retreat for the Insane at Hartford. His interest in the\r\ncause of the Deaf-Mute Education has continued unabated, and his memory\r\nwill be warmly cherished by that unfortunate class, as well as by a large\r\nclass of devoted friends. His last act in connection with the great cause\r\nto which all his best energies had been devoted, was the dictation of the\r\nfollowing letter to his son, Mr. Gallaudet of the New-York Institute, who\r\npresented it to the recent Convention at Hartford:\r\n\r\n                                         HARTFORD, Aug. 29, 1851.\r\n\r\n_To the President, Officers and Members of the Convention of those\r\ninterested in the Cause of Instruction of Deaf-Mutes, vote in session in\r\nthis City--_\r\n\r\n     GENTLEMEN: With deep regret I perceive that the state of my\r\n     health is such as to prevent my enjoying the pleasures and\r\n     the privileges of participating with you in the objects of\r\n     the Convention. Look to God for His wisdom and peace, and\r\n     may it be richly imparted to you. Accept the assurances of\r\n     my personal regard and best wishes for your success in your\r\n     various operations.\r\n\r\n                           Yours sincerely,      T. H. GALLAUDET.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nM. BEVERLEY TUCKER, the half-brother of John Randolph, died on the 26th of\r\nAugust, of a chronic affection, at Winchester, in Virginia. He was one of\r\nthe last of a generation and family, every member of which was remarkable\r\nfor high and peculiar endowment. The subject of our notice was not inferior\r\nto the kinsman whose fame was so peculiar, in all the essentials of a high\r\ncharacter and an exquisite genius. His writings, like the speeches of John\r\nRandolph, were distinguished by freedom, grace, wonderful raciness and\r\nspirit, and remarkable eloquence and point. He was the author of a series\r\nof lectures on Government--that of the United States in particular. He was\r\na politician of the States Rights School, unbending and unyielding in his\r\nfaith and tenacious of its minutest points. These lectures cannot be too\r\ncarefully studied, especially by the young men of the north, as they embody\r\nthe doctrines of Virginia and the South generally, and exhibit the extent\r\nof the political requisition of that great section of our country. They are\r\nbeautifully written--are, in short, among the best specimens of political\r\nwriting which we possess. Judge Tucker (he was sometime on the Bench in\r\nMissouri) was the author of many other works which deserve to be better\r\nknown. His province was fiction as well as politics, and he wrote poetry\r\nwith singular vigor. He was the translator of Goethe's Iphigenia, which was\r\npublished in the Southern Literary Messenger, and has left among other\r\nmanuscripts, an original drama, entitled \"Viola,\" written in blank verse.\r\nHis novel of \"George Balcombe,\" will be remembered by many readers, as a\r\nprose fiction at once highly interesting and well written. His \"Partisan\r\nLeader,\" another prose fiction in two volumes, is a political romance,\r\nembodying the Southern hostility to Mr. Van Buren's administration, and\r\n\"illustrating the tendencies of his party to a general usurpation of all\r\nthe attributes of sovereign power.\" His latest production, we believe, is a\r\nscattering criticism in the July issue of the Southern Quarterly Review, of\r\nGarland's life of John Randolph, a work which he bitterly denounced. Like\r\nhis half-brother, the orator of Roanoke, Judge Tucker, was a person of\r\nintense feelings and great excitability, an eager impulse, and a keen power\r\nof sarcasm. He wrote with all the eloquence with which the latter spoke.\r\nHis style is marked by great ease and freedom, by felicities of expression\r\nwhich give an epigrammatic point to his sentences, and by a sweetness and\r\nharmony of arrangement, which bestow music upon the ear without falling\r\ninto monotony. His thought was equally free and melodious. He thought\r\ndeeply and earnestly, and was never satisfied with the shallows of thought.\r\nIn diving, he was no less clear than deep; he brought up pearls where the\r\nawkward diver brings up mud only. Judge Tucker was a fine man; of warm\r\npassions, but noble nature; of powers of satire, but of benevolent heart.\r\nHe was probably sixty-eight years old when he died. He has left a wife and\r\nseveral children. We must not omit to mention that at the time of his death\r\nhe held the chair of Law in the College of William and Mary, at\r\nWilliamsburg, Va. Judge Tucker's last appearance in affairs was as a member\r\nof the Nashville Convention.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLEVI WOODBURY was born in 1790, at Francestown, a good farming village in\r\nthe interior of New Hampshire, where he received his early education,\r\nattending the district school during the winter months, and working on his\r\nfather's farm in the summer. From his boyhood he showed a decided taste for\r\nlearning, and on attaining the proper age, was sent to an academy, in order\r\nto prepare for college. He entered Dartmouth college in 1805, and after\r\npassing through the usual course, received his first degree, with a high\r\nreputation among his teachers and classmates for industry, talent, and\r\nuncommon perseverance. He at once selected the law as his future\r\nprofession, and having studied for the requisite term of three years at\r\nLitchfield, Boston, and Exeter, as well as his native place, was admitted\r\nto the bar in 1812. At that time party spirit was raging with intense\r\nfervor in every portion of New England. Mr. Woodbury took a decided stand\r\nin favor of Madison's administration and the war with Great Britain. He was\r\nsoon acknowledged as a shrewd and powerful leader of the party, which was\r\nthen in the minority in his native state. Devoted with youthful zeal to the\r\ncause which he had espoused, he exerted no small influence in changing the\r\npolitical character of the state, and aiding the Democratic party in\r\ngaining the ascendency, which they secured in 1816. On the first meeting of\r\nthe legislature, after his friends came into power, Mr. Woodbury was chosen\r\nSecretary of the Senate, and at the commencement of the following year was\r\nappointed a Judge of the Superior Court He was then but twenty-seven years\r\nof age, the youngest Judge, so far as we remember, that was ever elevated\r\nto a seat on the bench. The appointment caused great surprise to men of all\r\nparties, on account of the comparative youth of the incumbent, and his\r\nlimited experience of practice at the bar. He acquitted himself, however,\r\nof the duties of his arduous station with great credit. His name became\r\nstill more widely known, and in 1823 he was elected Governor of New\r\nHampshire by a large majority. Failing to be chosen, for a second term, he\r\nresumed the practice of his profession in Portsmouth, to which place he had\r\nremoved in 1819, and where he continued to have his permanent residence\r\nuntil the time of his decease. He immediately entered upon an extensive\r\npractice of his profession, and was surrounded with clients from all\r\nquarters. In 1825 he was chosen to the state legislature from the town of\r\nPortsmouth, and at the commencement of the session was elected Speaker of\r\nthe House, although it was the first time that he had been a member of any\r\nlegislative assembly. During this session he was chosen to fill a vacancy\r\nwhich had occurred in the Senate of the United States, and upon taking his\r\nseat in that body, he ably sustained the position of a leader of his party.\r\nHis term of service in the Senate expired in March, 1831. He had previously\r\ndeclined a re-election. On the reorganization of President Jackson's\r\ncabinet, in the month of April following, he was invited to take the office\r\nof Secretary of the Navy. He accepted the appointment, and discharged the\r\nduties of the office until 1834, when he became Secretary of the Treasury,\r\nin place of Mr. Taney, whose nomination had been rejected by the Senate. He\r\ncontinued in that post till the close of Mr. Van Buren's presidency, when\r\nhe resumed his seat in the Senate, to which he had been elected for six\r\nyears from the 4th of March, 1841. Mean time, on the decease of Judge\r\nStory, during the administration of Mr. Polk, he was appointed to fill the\r\nplace of that eminent jurist, and became a Judge of the Supreme Court of\r\nthe United States in 1846. From that time the deceased withdrew from active\r\nparticipation in political life, and devoted himself to the duties of his\r\nhigh station, which he discharged with assiduity and success. He died at\r\nPortsmouth, New Hampshire, September 3d, at the age of 61.\r\n\r\nWithout possessing the highest order of intellect, remarks the Tribune,\r\nJudge Woodbury had a large share of native shrewdness and unfailing\r\nquickness of political forecast, a very retentive memory, and a more than\r\ncommon power of logical reasoning. He was an effective speaker in debate,\r\nand understood the art of bringing men over to his views, even if they\r\nfailed to comprehend his arguments. His style of writing was turgid and\r\nobscure, doing little justice to his acknowledged clearness of intellect.\r\nHe made little use of common artifices for obtaining personal popularity,\r\nand though respected for his intelligence and solidity of character, was\r\nnever a great public favorite. In the private relations of life his\r\ncharacter was unblemished.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGEN. MCCLURE, of Elgin, Illinois, died at that place on the 15th of August,\r\nat the age of eighty years. Gen. McClure was a native of Londonderry,\r\nIreland, and emigrated to this country and settled at Bath, in the county\r\nof Steuben, prior to the year 1800. He removed from Bath to his late\r\nresidence in Illinois, in 1835. During his residence in that state he held\r\nmany offices of distinction, such as Surrogate, Judge, Sheriff, and member\r\nof the legislature. In 1813 he was in command of the American forces on the\r\nBuffalo frontier. He was severely censured for the burning of Newark (now\r\nNiagara), which took place whilst he was in command, but a subsequent\r\ndiscussion of that matter resulted in a very general conviction that the\r\nSecretary of War, General Armstrong, was mainly responsible for the act.\r\nWhatever of error he may have committed during a protracted life spent\r\nmostly in the service of the public, he will be remembered by the early\r\nsettlers of Western New York as an active and enterprising man, possessed\r\nof a sound head and an honest heart.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLORENZ OKEN, who was in his seventy-third year, died early in August The\r\n_Leader_ says, \"He will be known to many readers as the originator of that\r\ntheory of cranial homologies which has effected so great a revolution in\r\nanatomical science. His discovery of the skull as a continuation of the\r\nvertebral column--of its being, in fact, nothing but a congeries of four\r\nvertebrae, as the brain itself is but a congeries of nervous ganglia --will\r\nimmortalize his name; but if any unwary man of science opens the _Lehrbuch\r\nder Natur Philosophie_ with the expectation of studying a work of positive\r\nscience, he will be considerably astonished at finding Nature subjected to\r\nthe forms of Schelling's metaphysics; nor will he be reconciled to its\r\nstartling formulas by Oken's assuring him, that where God is called Fire or\r\nWater, these expressions are only to be understood symbolically--_nur\r\nsymbolisch zunehmen seyn_. The British reader is the last to learn with\r\npatience that \"Nothing exists but the Nothing:\" _es existirt nichts als das\r\nNichts_. Nor can you pacify him by the assurance that _Nichts_ does not\r\nmean _no existence_, but means _no special phenomenon_, the only true\r\nexistence being _The Absolute._ He very properly discards such \"metaphysic\r\nwit:\" and when Oken teaches that, \"God is the self-conscious Nothing;\r\nCreation is but God's act of self-consciousness; and that God came first to\r\nhis self-consciousness through the spoken word ([Greek: logos]) _the\r\nworld_. If God did not think, there would be no world; nay, he himself\r\nwould not be\"--when we say Oken teaches him in all seriousness such \"high\r\narguments\" as these, the British reader is apt to ask, \"My dear sir, _how\r\ndo you know all this?_\" A translation of Oken was published by Mr. Tulk\r\namong the works of the Ray Society, and excited both astonishment and\r\nmerriment in England. But, as we said, Oken's name is indelibly associated\r\nwith a great advance in science; to his labors we owe the admirable\r\nresearches of Professor Owen, and no amount of German metaphysics can quite\r\nobscure his renown.\"\r\n\r\nThe incidents of Oken's life are not many. In 1816, he began a journal\r\ncalled _Isis_, to which he intended to give an encyclopaedic character. As\r\nthe government of Saxe-Weimar then allowed the press greater freedom than\r\nother German states, many complainants selected this journal as their\r\norgan. Oken, whose views were liberal, printed such complaints whenever\r\nthey were of general interest. The consequence was, that the government of\r\nSaxe-Weimar was compelled, by the great powers of the German confederacy,\r\nto make him discontinue the _Isis_, or discharge him from the\r\nprofessorship. Oken chose to give up the latter, and continued to live in\r\nJena, with few interruptions. In 1827, he was made professor in the new\r\nuniversity of Munich, where he has continued to lecture ever since. His\r\nactivity is apparent from the list of his works: Outlines of the Philosophy\r\nof Nature, of the Theory of the Senses, and the Classification of Animals\r\nfounded thereon, 1802; Generation, 1805; Biology, a text-book for his\r\nLectures, 1805; Oken's and Kieser's Contributions to Comparative Anatomy\r\nand Physiology, 1806; On the Signification of the Bones of the Cranium,\r\n1807; On the Universe, a Continuation of the System of the Senses, 1808;\r\nFirst Ideas towards a Theory of Light, Darkness, Colors, and Heat, 1808;\r\nSketch of the Natural System of Metals, 1809; On the Value of Natural\r\nHistory, 1809; Origin and Cure of Hernia Umbilicalis, 1810; Manual of the\r\nPhilosophy of Nature, 1808, 1810, and 1811; Manual of Natural History,\r\n1813, 1815, and 1816; New Armament, New France, New Germany, 1813; Natural\r\nHistory for Schools, 1821. In 1833 he became professor at Zurich, and it\r\nwas there he wrote his General Views of Natural History, for all Classes,\r\nfrom 1833 to 1846.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOUNT VON KIELMANSEGGE, the Hanoverian general, died lately at Linden, aged\r\neighty-three. He was born at Ratzebourg, in the Duchy of Lauenburg, in the\r\nyear 1768, entered the army in 1793, and served against the French at\r\nNieuport in Holland, at Hamburg, at Quatre Bras, and Waterloo, where he\r\ncommanded a brigade.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nH. E. G. PAULUS, Doctor of Theology, of Philosophy, and of Laws, a man who,\r\nfor more than half a century, has been celebrated as one of the most able\r\nand active among the theological and philosophical writers of Germany, died\r\nat Heidelberg, on the 10th of August. Dr. Paulus was born at Lemberg, near\r\nStuttgard, in 1760. He studied chiefly at Tubingen, but visited several\r\nother universities in Germany, Holland, and England. While at Oxford, in\r\nthe year 1784, he was appointed Professor of Oriental Languages at Jena,\r\nchiefly through the recommendations of Griesbach. In 1793, he succeeded to\r\nthe theological chair, and gave lectures on theology above forty years at\r\nJena, Wurtzberg, and Heidleberg, till advancing age and its infirmities\r\ncompelled him to retire from his public duties. He published upwards of\r\nthirty different works, and gave us the best edition of Spinoza. He was a\r\nman of truly German erudition; and with Eichorn, Planck, and Lessing, one\r\nof the leaders of Rationalism, which has ended in Strass and Bruno\r\nBauer--unless we are to carry the influence further, and leave it in the\r\nhands of Feierbach and Max Steiner, avowed Atheists. His profound learning,\r\npenetrating judgment, unshrinking courage, and unwearied assiduity,\r\nobtained for his writings, which were very numerous, a wide circulation,\r\nand his researches, historical and critical, as well as the inferences he\r\ndeduced from them, produced, without doubt, considerable effect on the\r\npublic mind. In private life he was singularly amiable, easy of access,\r\ncourteous to strangers, bestowing kind and unostentatious attention on all\r\nwho sought his assistance, and ever actively employed up to his ninetieth\r\nyear in endeavoring to promote freedom, order, and peace, piety, virtue,\r\nand humanity. Paulus had the degree of Doctor of Laws from Frieberg, in\r\nconsequence of his critique of the famous process of Fonk. We have referred\r\nto the number of his works (those on oriental literature are enumerated by\r\n_Meusel_), but allusion should be made to his periodicals: his\r\n_Sophronizon_, established in 1819, devoted to church and state, and\r\nreceived with great favor by both Protestants and Catholics. In 1825 he\r\nbegan _Der Denkglaubige_, (the Thinking Believer), and in 1827,\r\n_Kirchenbeleuchtungen_, in which he aimed to show the true state of\r\nRomanism and Protestantism.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJOSEPH RUSIECKI, one of the oldest and the most distinguished of the Polish\r\nemigrants in France, died early in August, in the hospital at Vierzon. He\r\nwas born in 1770, and commenced his military career in 1787. He fought\r\nagainst the Russians in 1794, under the command of the immortal Koscinsko.\r\nAfter the partition of Poland he entered the service of the French\r\nRepublic, fondly hoping, like many others who were equally deceived, that\r\nhis country's independence would be restored through French influence. He\r\nmade the campaigns of Italy with the First Consul, and formed part of the\r\nexpedition to St. Domingo under Rochambeau. He served subsequently in the\r\ncuirassiers, commanded by General Hautpoul, who died in his arms on the\r\nsanguinary field of Eylau. On the cuirassiers, who were cut to pieces in\r\nthat battle, being reorganized, it was observed to Napoleon that Lieutenant\r\nRusiecki was not the height for a cuirassier. The Emperor commanded him to\r\nalight, and placing himself back to back with him, he remarked to his\r\naid-de-camp, \"You are mistaken, sir, he is not a dwarf, he is my size,\" and\r\nat the same time he promoted him to the rank of captain in that corps. He\r\nwas named Major in the year 1812, during the campaign of Russia. He\r\ncommanded the 22d regiment of the line during the war of Independence, in\r\nthe year 1831. His remains were accompanied to the grave by the principal\r\ninhabitants of Vierzon, and by the National Guard.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJOHN GOTTFRIED GRUBER, Professor of Philosophy at Halle, was born at\r\nNaumburg on the 29th November, 1774, and educated at the University of\r\nLeipsic, where he was distinguished for attainments in philosophy,\r\nphilology, mathematics, and natural science generally. In addition to\r\nnumerous learned works on history, archaeology, mythology, etc., he was the\r\nprincipal editor of the celebrated Universal Encyclopaedia, in 109 volumes.\r\nHe died at Halle about the middle of August.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJOHN HOBART, second Earl of Clare, was born in Queens, 1792, and graduated\r\nat Christchurch, Oxford, where in 1812, he was second in classics. He,\r\nthroughout life, cultivated his taste for literature, and for the society\r\nof literary men. He was a college associate and intimate friend of Lord\r\nByron. He was a Knight of St Patrick, G.C.H., a Privy Councillor, Vice\r\nPresident of the Royal Society, and far many years was Governor of Bombay.\r\nHe died at Brighton on the 18th of August.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSIR HENRY JARDINE, a son of Rev. Dr. Jardine, who projected the first\r\nEdinburgh Review, in 1755, was born in Edinburgh on the 30th of January,\r\n1766, and after a successful career in the law, retired from public\r\nemployment in 1837, with a yearly pension of L1400. He was knighted by King\r\nGeorge IV., on the 29th of April, 1825. He was a member of the Royal\r\nSociety of Edinburgh, of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, and of\r\nmost of the literary, scientific, and charitable institutions of Edinburgh.\r\nThe Society of Antiquaries, in particular, profited largely by the interest\r\nwhich he took in its affairs for many years. He was a contributor to the\r\nBannatyne Club, of the pleasing and characteristic \"Diary of James\r\nMelville, minister of Kilrenny.\" In private life, Sir Henry Jardine had\r\nmany friends, among whom were Sir Walter Scott, and other distinguished men\r\nof his time.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLADY LOUISA STUART died in London on the 4th of August, aged nearly 94. She\r\nwas the youngest daughter of the Earl of Bute, the celebrated minister\r\nduring our revolution, and was granddaughter of Lady Mary Wortley Montague,\r\nto whose works she wrote the charming introductory anecdotes prefixed in\r\nLord Wharncliffe's edition. She remembered to have seen her grandmother,\r\nLady Mary, when at old Wortley's death that celebrated woman returned to\r\nLondon after her long and still unexplained exile from England. Lady Louisa\r\nherself was a charming letter-writer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ladies' Late Summer Fashions._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe season being now far advanced, no change of fashions can be looked for\r\nuntil autumn shall have fairly set in; but a great variety in costume is\r\nobtained by the different combinations of the articles already introduced.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n_White Muslin Mantelets_ are much worn. The selection for our illustration\r\nis of the shawl form, much rounded at the back. The ends in front are also\r\nslightly rounded. The mantelet is made of thin, soft, white muslin, and is\r\ntrimmed with worked volants from six to seven inches broad, and set on\r\nrather full. The back and front are edged with two volants; and a third,\r\npassing over the armhole, forms a sort of sleeve. The dress worn with this\r\nmantelet is of white muslin, ornamented with needlework; but the mantelet\r\nis intended to be worn in outdoor costume with a dress of silk or barege.\r\nThe pattern of the needlework consists of a deep scallop, with a notched or\r\ndentated edge. Within each large scallop there is a sprig, the leaves of\r\nwhich are formed in open work.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nSeveral _Evening Dresses_, worn at the most recent parties, are of a style\r\nwhich would not be inappropriate for winter soirees; for instance, some of\r\nthe new silk dresses intended for evening wear are trimmed with black lace\r\nflounces, the corsage ornamented and edged with narrow black velvet. Many\r\ndresses of printed organdy have been prepared for evening costume; one has\r\nthe design printed in pink, the pattern being small bouquets; another,\r\nwith the pattern in blue, is made with seven flounces, and each flounce is\r\nedged with narrow gauze ribbon, the corsage also ornamented with gauze\r\nribbons. This style of trimming renders the dress very elegant.\r\n\r\nThe _Headdresses_ worn at evening parties present no novelty. Natural\r\nflowers may be worn in the hair with greater advantage at this season than\r\nat any other, as they fade less rapidly, than the summer flowers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe newest style of _Full Dress for Little Girls_ comprises some very\r\npretty white muslin dresses, ornamented with tabliers of needlework. Bows\r\nof ribbon ornament the sleeves, and one is fixed at the waist behind. A\r\nwhite muslin dress, worn over a pink or blue slip is a fashionable style\r\nfor little girls. With these dresses should be worn a sash with flowing\r\nends. Some of these dresses are made with basques, notwithstanding that the\r\ncorsage is low and the sleeves short. The skirt is always short, and\r\ntrousers are indispensable.\r\n\r\nFor _Little Boys_ who have not yet attained the age for wearing the jacket,\r\nthe tunic or blouse is adopted. The Russian blouse is made all in one\r\npiece, but opening on the left side; or the blouse may be made in a style\r\ncalled the Scottish blouse, namely, with a plain corsage, having basques or\r\ntails, the skirt very full, and cut bias way. Either of the above forms are\r\nfashionable, and they are made of almost every kind of material, but those\r\nof chequered silk, especially for very little boys, are the most distingue.\r\nShort trousers and socks complete the costume.\r\n\r\nThe dress in the first of the above figures is of a plaided barege, of a\r\ndelicate pink. The second is of a light silk dress of salmon-colored silk,\r\nvan-dyked; bonnet of white chip. In all the recent patterns the advance\r\ntoward autumn modes is too slight to need specification.",
