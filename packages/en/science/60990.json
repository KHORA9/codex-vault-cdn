G. F. H. S. WANDSWORTH COMMON, S.W.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has been my endeavour to provide in this book a concise, yet\r\nsufficiently complete, account of the physical characters of the\r\nmineral species which find service in jewellery, and of the methods\r\navailable for determining their principal physical constants to enable\r\na reader, even if previously unacquainted with the subject, to have\r\nat hand all the information requisite for the sure identification of\r\nany cut stone which may be met with. For several reasons I have dealt\r\nsomewhat more fully with the branches of science closely connected with\r\nthe properties of crystallized matter than has been customary hitherto\r\nin even the most comprehensive books on precious stones. Recent years\r\nhave witnessed many changes in the jewellery world. Gem-stones are no\r\nlonger entirely drawn from a few well-marked mineral species, which\r\nare, on the whole, easily distinguishable from one another, and it\r\nbecomes increasingly difficult for even the most experienced eye to\r\nrecognize a cut stone with unerring certainty. So long as the only\r\nconfusion lay between precious stones and paste imitations an ordinary\r\nfile was the solitary piece of apparatus required by the jeweller, but\r\nnow recourse must be had to more discriminative tests, such as the\r\nrefractive index or the specific gravity, the determination of which\r\ncalls for a little knowledge and skill. Concurrently, a keener interest\r\nis being taken in the scientific aspect of gem-stones by the public at\r\nlarge, who are attracted to them mainly by æsthetic considerations.\r\n\r\nWhile the treatment has been kept as simple as possible, technical\r\nexpressions, where necessary, have not been avoided, but their meanings\r\nhave been explained, and it is hoped that their use will not prove\r\nstumbling-blocks to the novice. Unfamiliar words of this kind often\r\ngive a forbidding air to a new subject, but they are used merely to\r\navoid circumlocution, and not, like the incantations of a wizard, to\r\nveil the difficulties in still deeper gloom. For actual practical work\r\nthe pages on the refractometer and its use and the method of heavy\r\nliquids for the determination of specific gravities, and the tables of\r\nphysical constants at the end of the book, with occasional reference,\r\nin case of doubt, to the descriptions of the several species alone\r\nare required; other methods—such as the prismatic mode of measuring\r\nrefractive indices, or the hydrostatic way of finding specific\r\ngravities—which find a place in the ordinary curriculum of a physics\r\ncourse are described in their special application to gem-stones, but\r\nthey are not so suitable for workshop practice. Since the scope of the\r\nbook is confined mainly to the stones as they appear on the market,\r\nlittle has been said about their geological occurrence; the case of\r\ndiamond, however, is of exceptional interest and has been more fully\r\ntreated. The weights stated for the historical diamonds are those\r\nusually published, and are probably in many instances far from correct,\r\nbut they serve to give an idea of the sizes of the stones; the English\r\ncarat is the unit used, and the numbers must be increased by about 2½\r\nper cent. if the weights be expressed in metric carats. The prices\r\nquoted for the various species must only be regarded as approximate,\r\nsince they may change from year to year, or even day to day, according\r\nto the state of trade and the whim of fashion.\r\n\r\nThe diagram on Plate II and most of the crystal drawings were made\r\nby me. The remaining drawings are the work of Mr. H. H. Penton. He\r\nlikewise prepared the coloured drawings of cut stones which appear\r\non the three coloured plates, his models, with two exceptions, being\r\nselected from the cut specimens in the Mineral Collection of the\r\nBritish Museum by permission of the Trustees. Unfortunately, the\r\ndifficulties that still beset the reproduction of pictures in colour\r\nhave prevented full justice being done to the faithfulness of his\r\nbrush. I highly appreciate the interest he took in the work, and the\r\ncare and skill with which it was executed. My thanks are due to the\r\nDe Beers Consolidated Mines Co. Ltd., and to Sir Henry A. Miers,\r\nF.R.S., Principal of the University of London, for the illustrations\r\nof the Kimberley and Wesselton diamond mines, and of the methods and\r\napparatus employed in breaking up and concentrating the blue ground;\r\nto Messrs. I. J. Asscher & Co. for the use of the photograph of the\r\nCullinan diamond; to Mr. J. H. Steward for the loan of the block of the\r\nrefractometer; and to Mr. H. W. Atkinson for the illustration of the\r\ndiamond-sorting machine. My colleague, Mr. W. Campbell Smith, B.A., has\r\nmost kindly read the proof-sheets, and has been of great assistance in\r\nmany ways. I hope that, thanks to his invaluable help, the errors in\r\nthe book which may have escaped notice will prove few in number and\r\nunimportant in character. To Mr. Edward Hopkins I owe an especial debt\r\nof gratitude for his cheerful readiness to assist me in any way in\r\nhis power. He read both the manuscript and the proof-sheets, and the\r\ninformation with regard to the commercial and practical side of the\r\nsubject was very largely supplied by him. He also placed at my service\r\na large number of photographs, some of which—for instance, those\r\nillustrating the cutting of stones—he had specially taken for me, and\r\nhe procured for me the jewellery designs shown on Plates IV and V.\r\n\r\nIf this book be found by those engaged in the jewellery trade helpful\r\nin their everyday work, and if it wakens in readers generally an\r\nappreciation of the variety of beautiful minerals suitable for gems,\r\nand an interest in the wondrous qualities of crystallized substances, I\r\nshall be more than satisfied.\r\n                                                          G.

Stones lacking any of them cannot aspire to\r\na high place in the ranks of precious stones, although it does not\r\nnecessarily follow that they are of no use for ornamental purposes. The\r\ncase of pearl, which, though not properly included among gem-stones,\r\nbeing directly produced by living agency, yet holds an honoured place\r\nin jewellery, constitutes to some extent an exception, since its\r\nincontestable beauty atones for its comparative want of durability.\r\n\r\nThat a gem-stone should be a delight to the eye is a truism that need\r\nnot be laboured; for such is its whole _raison d’être_. The members\r\nof the Mineral Kingdom that find service in jewellery may be divided\r\ninto three groups, according as they are transparent, translucent,\r\nor opaque. Of these the first, which is by far the largest and the\r\nmost important, may itself be further sub-divided into two sections:\r\nstones which are devoid of colour, and stones which are tinted. Among\r\nthe former, diamond reigns supreme, since it alone possesses that\r\nmarvellous ‘fire,’ oscillating with every movement from heavenly blue\r\nto glowing red, which is so highly esteemed and so much besought.\r\nOther stones, such as ‘fired’ zircon, white sapphire, white topaz, and\r\nrock-crystal, may dazzle with brilliancy of light reflected from the\r\nsurface or emitted from the interior, but none of them, like diamond,\r\nglow with mysterious gleams. No hint of colour, save perhaps a trace\r\nof the blue of steel, can be tolerated in stones of this category;\r\nabove all is a touch of the jaundice hue of yellow abhorred. It taxes\r\nall the skill of the lapidary to assure that the disposition of the\r\nfacets be such as to reveal the full splendour of the stone. A coloured\r\nstone, on the other hand, depends for its attractiveness more upon its\r\nintrinsic hue than upon the manner of its cutting. The tint must not be\r\ntoo light or too dark in shade: a stone that has barely any colour has\r\nlittle interest, and one which is too dark appears almost opaque and\r\nblack. The lapidary can to some extent remedy these defects by cutting\r\nthe former deep and the latter shallow. In certain curious stones—for\r\ninstance tourmaline—the transparency, and in others—such as ruby,\r\nsapphire, and one of the recent additions to the gem world, kunzite—the\r\ncolour, varies considerably in different directions. The colours that\r\nare most admired—the fiery red of ruby, the royal blue of sapphire,\r\nthe verdant green of emerald, and the golden yellow of topaz—are pure\r\ntints, and the absorption spectra corresponding to them are on the\r\nwhole continuous and often restricted. They therefore retain the purity\r\nof their colour even in artificial light, though certain sapphires\r\ntransmit a relatively larger amount of red, and consequently turn\r\npurple at night. Of the small group of translucent stones which pass\r\nlight, but are not clear enough to be seen through, the most important\r\nis opal. It and certain others of the group owe their merit to the\r\nsame optical effect as that characterizing soap-bubbles, tarnished\r\nsteel, and so forth, and not to any intrinsic coloration. Another\r\nset of stones—moonstone and the star-stones—reflect light from the\r\ninterior more or less regularly, but not in such a way as to produce\r\na play of colour. The last group, which comprises opaque stones, has\r\na single representative among ordinary gem-stones, namely, turquoise.\r\nIn this case light is scattered and reflected from layers immediately\r\ncontiguous to the surface, and the colour is due to the resulting\r\nabsorption. The apparent darkness of a deep-coloured stone follows from\r\na different cause: the light passing into the stone is wholly absorbed\r\nwithin it, and, since none is emitted, the stone appears black. The\r\nclaims of turquoise are maintained by the blue variety; there is little\r\ndemand for stones of a greenish tinge.\r\n\r\nIt is evidently desirable that any stones used in jewellery should be\r\nable to resist the mechanical and chemical actions of everyday life. No\r\none is anxious to replace jewels every few years, and the most valuable\r\nstones are expected to endure for all time. The mechanical abrasion\r\nis caused by the minute grains of sand that are contained in ordinary\r\ndust, and gem-stones should be at least as hard as they—a condition\r\nfulfilled by all the principal species with the exception of opal,\r\nturquoise, peridot, and demantoid. Since the beauty of the first named\r\ndoes not depend on the brilliancy of its polish, scratches on the\r\nsurface are not of much importance; further, all four are only slightly\r\nsofter than sand. It may be noted that the softness of paste stones,\r\napart from any objections that may be felt to the use of imitations,\r\nrenders them unsuitable for jewellery purposes. The only stones that\r\nare likely to be chemically affected in the course of wear are those\r\nwhich are in the slightest degree porous. It is hazardous to immerse\r\nturquoises in liquids, even in water, lest the bluish green colour be\r\noxidized to the despised yellowish hue. The risk of damage to opals,\r\nmoonstones, and star-stones by the penetration of dirt or grease into\r\nthe interior of the stones is less, but is not wholly negligible.\r\nSimilar remarks apply with even greater force to pearls. Their charm,\r\nwhich is due to a peculiar surface-play of light, might be destroyed by\r\ncontamination with grease, ink, or similar matter; they are, moreover,\r\nsoft. For both reasons their use in rings is much to be deprecated.\r\nNothing can be more unsightly than the dingy appearance of a pearl ring\r\nafter a few years’ wear.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be gainsaid that mankind prefers the rare to the beautiful,\r\nand what is within reach of all is lightly esteemed. It is for this\r\nreason that garnet and moonstone lie under a cloud. Purchasers can\r\nreadily be found for a ‘Cape-ruby’ or an ‘olivine,’ but not for a\r\ngarnet; garnets are so common, is the usual remark. Nevertheless,\r\nthe stones mentioned are really garnets. If science succeeded in\r\nmanufacturing diamonds at the cost of shillings instead of the pounds\r\nthat are now asked for Nature’s products—not that such a prospect is at\r\nall probable or even feasible—we might expect them to vanish entirely\r\nfrom fashionable jewellery.\r\n\r\nA careful study of the showcases of the most extensive jewellery\r\nestablishment brings to light the fact that, despite the apparent\r\nprofusion, the number of different species represented is restricted.\r\nDiamond, ruby, emerald, sapphire, pearl, opal, turquoise, topaz,\r\namethyst are all that are ordinarily asked for. Yet, as later pages\r\nwill show, there are many others worthy of consideration; two among\r\nthem—peridot and tourmaline—are, indeed, slowly becoming known. For\r\nthe first five of the stones mentioned above, the demand is relatively\r\nsteady, and varies absolutely only with the purchasing power of the\r\nworld; but a lesser known stone may suddenly spring into prominence\r\nowing to the caprice of fashion or the preference of some great lady\r\nor leader of fashion. Not many years ago, for instance, violet was the\r\nfavourite colour for ladies’ dresses, and consequently amethysts were\r\nmuch worn to match, but with the change of fashion they speedily sank\r\nto their former obscurity. Another stone may perhaps figure at some\r\nroyal wedding; for a brief while it becomes the vogue, and afterwards\r\nis seldom seen.\r\n\r\nExcept that diamond, ruby, emerald, and sapphire, and, we should add,\r\npearl, may indisputably be considered to occupy the first rank, it is\r\nimpossible to form the gem-stones in any strict order. Every generation\r\nsees some change. The value of a stone is after all merely what it will\r\nfetch in the open market, and its artistic merits may be a matter of\r\nopinion. The familiar aphorism, _de gustibus non est disputandum_, is a\r\nwarning not to enlarge upon this point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           PART I—SECTION A\r\n\r\n                     THE CHARACTERS OF GEM-STONES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II\r\n\r\n                           CRYSTALLINE FORM\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the single exception of opal, the whole of the principal mineral\r\nspecies used in jewellery are distinguished from glass and similar\r\nsubstances by one fundamental difference: they are crystallized matter,\r\nand the atoms composing them are regularly arranged throughout the\r\nstructure.\r\n\r\nThe words crystal and glass are employed in science in senses differing\r\nconsiderably from those in popular use. The former of them is derived\r\nfrom the Greek word κρύος, meaning ice, and was at one time used in\r\nthat sense. For instance, the old fourteenth-century reading of Psalm\r\ncxlvii. 17, which appears in the authorized version as “He giveth his\r\nice like morsels,” ran “He sendis his kristall as morcels.” It was\r\nalso applied to the beautiful, lustrous quartz found among the eternal\r\nsnows of the Alps, since, on account of their limpidity, these stones\r\nwere supposed, as Pliny tells us, to consist of water congealed by the\r\nextreme cold of those regions; such at the present day is the ordinary\r\nmeaning of the word. But, when early investigators discovered that a\r\nsalt solution on evaporation left behind groups of slender glistening\r\nprisms, each very similar to the rest, they naturally—though, as we\r\nnow know, wrongly—regarded them as representing yet another form\r\nof congealed water, and applied the same word to such substances.\r\nSubsequent research has shown that these salts, as well as mineral\r\nsubstances occurring with natural faces in nature, have in common the\r\nfundamental property of regularity of arrangement of the constituent\r\natoms, and science therefore defines by the word crystal a substance in\r\nwhich the structure is uniform throughout, and all the similar atoms\r\ncomposing it are arranged with regard to the structure in a similar way.\r\n\r\nThe other word is yet more familiar; it denotes the transparent,\r\nlustrous, hard, and brittle substance produced by the fusion of sand\r\nwith soda or potash or both which fills our windows and serves a\r\nvariety of useful purposes. Research has shown that glass, though\r\napparently so uniform in character, has in reality no regularity of\r\nmolecular arrangement. It is, in fact, a kind of mosaic of atoms,\r\nhuddled together anyhow, but so irregular is its irregularity that\r\nit simulates perfect regularity. Science uses the word glass in this\r\nwidened meaning. Two substances may, as a matter of fact, have the\r\nsame chemical composition, and one be a crystal and the other a glass.\r\nFor example, quartz, if heated to a high temperature, may be fused and\r\nconverted into a glass. The difference in the two types of structure\r\nmay be illustrated by a comparison between a regiment of soldiers\r\ndrawn up on parade and an ordinary crowd of people.\r\n\r\nThe crystalline form is a visible sign of the molecular arrangement,\r\nand is intimately associated with the directional physical properties,\r\nsuch as the optical characters, cleavage, etc. A study of it is not\r\nonly of interest in itself, but also of great importance to the\r\nlapidary who wishes to cut a stone to the best advantage, and it is,\r\nmoreover, of service in distinguishing stones when in the rough state.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.—Cubo-Octahedra.]\r\n\r\nThe development of natural faces on a crystal is far from being\r\nhaphazard, but is governed by the condition that the angles between\r\nsimilar faces, whether on the same crystal or on different crystals,\r\nare equal, however varying may be the shapes and the relative sizes\r\nof the faces (Fig. 1), and by the tendency of the faces bounding\r\nthe crystal to fall into series with parallel edges, such series\r\nbeing termed zones. Each species has a characteristic type of\r\ncrystallization, which may be referred to one of the following six\r\nsystems:—\r\n\r\n1. _Cubic._—Crystals in this system can be referred to three edges,\r\nwhich are mutually at right angles, and in which the directional\r\ncharacters are identical in value. These principal edges are known\r\nas axes. Some typical forms are the cube (Fig. 2), characteristic\r\nof fluor; the octahedron (Fig. 3), characteristic of diamond and\r\nspinel; the dodecahedron (Fig. 4), characteristic of garnet; and the\r\ntriakisoctahedron, or three-faced octahedron (Fig. 5).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.—Cube.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.—Octahedron.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.—Dodecahedron.]\r\n\r\nAll crystals belonging to this system are singly refractive.\r\n\r\n2. _Tetragonal._—Such crystals can be referred to three axes, which are\r\nmutually at right angles, but in only two of them are the directional\r\ncharacters identical. A typical form is a four-sided prism, _mm_, of\r\nsquare section, terminated by four triangular faces, _p_ (Fig. 6), the\r\nusual shape of crystals of zircon and idocrase.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.—Triakisoctahedron, or Three-faced Octahedron.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.—Tetragonal Crystal.]\r\n\r\nCrystals belonging to this system are doubly refractive and uniaxial,\r\n_i.e._ they have one direction of single refraction (cf. p. 45), which\r\nis parallel to the unequal edge of the three mentioned above.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.—Two alternative sets of Axes in the Hexagonal\r\nSystem.]\r\n\r\n3. _Hexagonal._—Such crystals can be referred alternatively either\r\nto a set of three axes, _X_, _Y_, _Z_ (Fig. 7), which lie in a plane\r\nperpendicular to a fourth, _H_, and are mutually inclined at angles of\r\n60°, or to a set of three, _a_, _b_, _c_, which are not at right angles\r\nas in the cubic system, but in which the directional characters are\r\nidentical. The fourth axis in the first arrangement is equally inclined\r\nto each in the second set of axes. Many important species crystallize\r\nin this system—corundum (sapphire, ruby), beryl (emerald, aquamarine),\r\ntourmaline, quartz, and phenakite. The crystals usually display a\r\nsix-sided prism, terminated by a single face, _c_, perpendicular to the\r\nedge of the prism _m_ (Fig. 8), _e.g._ emerald, or by six or twelve\r\ninclined faces, _p_ (Fig. 9), _e.g._ quartz, crystals of which are so\r\nconstant in form as to be the most familiar in the Mineral Kingdom.\r\nTourmaline crystals (Fig. 10) are peculiar because of the fact that\r\noften one end is obviously to the eye flatter than the other.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGS. 8-10.—Hexagonal Crystals.]\r\n\r\nCrystals belonging to this system are also doubly refractive and\r\nuniaxial, the direction of single refraction being parallel to the\r\nfourth axis mentioned above, and therefore also parallel to the prism\r\nedge. Hence deeply coloured tourmaline, which strongly absorbs the\r\nordinary ray, must be cut with the table-facet parallel to the edge of\r\nthe prism.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.—Relation of the two directions of single\r\nRefraction to the Axes in an Orthorhombic Crystal.]\r\n\r\n4. _Orthorhombic._—Such crystals can be referred to three axes, which\r\nare mutually at right angles, but in which each of the directional\r\ncharacters are different. The crystals are usually prismatic in shape,\r\none of the axes being parallel to the prism edge. Topaz, peridot, and\r\nchrysoberyl are the most important species crystallizing in this system.\r\n\r\nCrystals belonging to this system are doubly refractive and biaxial,\r\n_i.e._ they have two directions of single refraction (cf. p. 45). The\r\nthree axes _a_, _b_, _c_ (Fig. 11) are parallel respectively to the two\r\nbisectrices of the directions of single refraction, and the direction\r\nperpendicular to the plane containing those directions.\r\n\r\n5. _Monoclinic._—Such crystals can be referred to three axes, one\r\nof which is at right angles to the other two, which are, however,\r\nthemselves not at right angles. Spodumene (kunzite) and some moonstone\r\ncrystallize in this system.\r\n\r\nCrystals belonging to this system are doubly refractive and biaxial,\r\nbut in this case the first axis alone is parallel to one of the\r\nprincipal optical directions.\r\n\r\n6. _Triclinic._—Such crystals have no edges at right angles, and the\r\noptical characters are not immediately related to the crystalline form.\r\nSome moonstone crystallizes in this system.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12.—Twinned Octahedron.]\r\n\r\nCrystals are often not single separate individuals. For instance,\r\ndiamond and spinel are found in flat triangular crystals with their\r\ngirdles cleft at the corners (Fig. 12). Each of such crystals is\r\nreally composed of portions of two similar octahedra, which are placed\r\ntogether in such a way that each is a reflection of the other. Such\r\ncomposite crystals are called twins or macles. Sometimes the twinning\r\nis repeated, and the individuals may be so minute as to call for a\r\nmicroscope for their perception.\r\n\r\nA composite structure may also result from the conjunction of\r\nnumberless minute individuals without any definite orientation, as in\r\nthe case of chalcedony and agate. So by supposing the individuals to\r\nbecome infinitesimally small, we pass to a glass-like substance.\r\n\r\nIt is often a peculiarity of crystals of a species to display a typical\r\ncombination of natural faces. Such a combination is known as the habit\r\nof the species, and is often of service for the purpose of identifying\r\nstones before they are cut. Thus, a habit of diamond and spinel is\r\nan octahedron, often twinned, of garnet a dodecahedron, of emerald a\r\nflat-ended hexagonal prism, and so on.\r\n\r\nIt is one of the most interesting and remarkable features connected\r\nwith crystallization that the composition and the physical\r\ncharacters—for instance, the refractive indices and specific\r\ngravity—may, without any serious disturbance of the molecular\r\narrangement, vary considerably owing to the more or less complete\r\nreplacement of one element by another closely allied to it. That is\r\nthe cause of the range of the physical characters which has been\r\nobserved in such species as tourmaline, peridot, spinel, etc. The\r\nprincipal replacements in the case of the gem-stones are ferric oxide,\r\nFe_{2}O_{3}, by alumina, Al_{2}O_{3}, and ferrous oxide, FeO, by\r\nmagnesia, MgO.\r\n\r\nA list of the principal gem-stones, arranged by their chemical\r\ncomposition, is given in Table I at the end of the book.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III\r\n\r\n                REFLECTION, REFRACTION, AND DISPERSION\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that, since a stone suitable for ornamental use must\r\nappeal to the eye, its most important characters are those which depend\r\nupon light; indeed, the whole art of the lapidary consists in shaping\r\nit in such a way as to show these qualities to the best advantage. To\r\nunderstand why certain forms are given to a cut stone, it is essential\r\nfor us to ascertain what becomes of the light which falls upon the\r\nsurface of the stone; further, we shall find that the action of a\r\nstone upon light is of very great help in distinguishing the different\r\nspecies of gem-stones. The phenomena displayed by light which impinges\r\nupon the surface separating two media[1] are very similar in character,\r\nwhatever be the nature of the media.\r\n\r\nOrdinary experience with a plane mirror tells us that, when light is\r\nreturned, or reflected, as it is usually termed, from a plane or flat\r\nsurface, there is no alteration in the size of objects viewed in this\r\nway, but that the right and the left hands are interchanged: our right\r\nhand becomes the left hand in our reflection in the mirror. We notice,\r\nfurther, that our reflection is apparently just as far distant from the\r\nmirror on the farther side as we are on this side. In Fig. 13 _MM´_\r\nis a section of the mirror, and _O´_ is the image of the hand _O_ as\r\nseen in the mirror. Light from _O_ reaches the eye _E_ by way of _m_,\r\nbut it appears to come from _O´_. Since _OO´_ is perpendicular to the\r\nmirror, and _O_ and _O´_ lie at equal distances from it, it follows\r\nfrom elementary geometry that the angle _i´_, which the reflected ray\r\nmakes with _mn_, the normal to the mirror, is equal to _i_, the angle\r\nwhich the incident ray makes with the same direction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13.—Reflection at a Plane Mirror.]\r\n\r\nAgain, everyday experience tells us that the case is less simple when\r\nlight actually crosses the bounding surface and passes into the other\r\nmedium. Thus, if we look down into a bath filled with water, the\r\nbottom of the bath appears to have been raised up, and a stick plunged\r\ninto the water seems to be bent just at the surface, except in the\r\nparticular case when it is perfectly upright. Since the stick itself\r\nhas not been bent, light evidently suffers some change in direction as\r\nit passes into the water or emerges therefrom. The passage of light\r\nfrom one medium to another was studied by Snell in the seventeenth\r\ncentury, and he enunciated the following laws:—\r\n\r\n1. The refracted ray lies in the plane containing the incident ray and\r\nthe normal to the plane surface separating the two media.\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that the reflected ray obeys this law also.\r\n\r\n2. The angle _r_, which the refracted ray makes with the normal, is\r\nrelated to the angle _i_, which the incident ray makes with the same\r\ndirection, by the equation\r\n\r\n                _n_ sin _i_ = _n´_ sin _r_,        (_a_)\r\n\r\nwhere _n_ and _n´_ are constants for the two media which are known as\r\nthe indices of refraction, or the refractive indices.\r\n\r\nThis simple trigonometrical relation may be expressed in geometrical\r\nlanguage. Suppose we cut a plane section through the two media at right\r\nangles to the bounding plane, which then appears as a straight line,\r\n_SOS´_ (Fig. 14), and suppose that _IO_ represents the direction of\r\nthe incident ray; then Snell’s first law tells us that the refracted\r\nray _OR_ will also lie in this plane. Draw the normal _NON´_, and with\r\ncentre _O_ and any radius describe a circle intersecting the incident\r\nand refracted rays in the points _a_ and _b_ respectively; let drop\r\nperpendiculars _ac_ and _bd_ on to the normal _NON´_. Then we have\r\n_n.ac = n´.bd_, whence we see that if _n_ be greater than _n´_, _ac_\r\nis less than _bd_, and therefore when light passes from one medium\r\ninto another which is less optically dense, in its passage across the\r\nboundary it is bent, or refracted, away from the normal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14.—Refraction across a Plane Surface.]\r\n\r\nWe see, then, that when light falls on the boundary of two different\r\nmedia, some is reflected in the first and some is refracted into the\r\nsecond medium. The relative amounts of light reflected and refracted\r\ndepend on the angle of incidence and the refractive indices of the\r\nmedia. We shall return to this point when we come to consider the\r\nlustre of stones.\r\n\r\nWe will proceed to consider the course of rays at different angles of\r\nincidence when light passes out from a medium into one less dense—for\r\ninstance, from water into air. Corresponding to light with a small\r\nangle of incidence such as _I_{1}O_ (Fig. 15), some of it is reflected\r\nin the direction _OI´_{1}_ and the remainder is refracted out in the\r\ndirection _OR_{1}_. Similarly, for the ray _I_{2}O_ some is reflected\r\nalong _OI´_{2}_ and some refracted along _OR_{2}_. Since, in the case\r\nwe have taken, the angle of refraction is greater than the angle of\r\nincidence, the refracted ray corresponding to some incident, ray\r\n_I_{c}O_ will graze the bounding surface, and corresponding to a\r\nray beyond it, such as _I_{3}O_, which has a still greater angle of\r\nincidence, there is no refracted ray, and all the light is wholly\r\nor totally reflected within the dense medium. The critical angle\r\n_I_{c}ON_, which is called the angle of total-reflection, is very\r\nsimply related to the refractive indices of the two media; for, since\r\n_r_ is now a right angle, sin _r_ = 1, and equation (_a_) becomes\r\n\r\n                         _n_ sin _i_ = _n´_        (_b_)\r\n\r\nHence, if the angle of total-reflection is measured and one of the\r\nindices is known, the other can easily be calculated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15.—Total-Reflection.]\r\n\r\nThe phenomenon of total-reflection may be appreciated if we hold a\r\nglass of water above our head, and view the light of a lamp on a table\r\nreflected from the under surface of the water. This reflection is\r\nincomparably more brilliant than that given by the upper surface.\r\n\r\nThe refractive index of air is taken as unity; strictly, it is that of\r\na vacuum, but the difference is too small to be appreciated even in\r\nvery delicate work. Every substance has different indices for light\r\nof different colour, and it is customary to take as the standard the\r\nyellow light of a sodium flame. This happens to be the colour to\r\nwhich our eyes are most sensitive, and a flame of this kind is easily\r\nprepared by volatilizing a little bicarbonate of soda in the flame of\r\na bunsen burner. A survey of Table III at the end of the book shows\r\nclearly how valuable a measurement of the refractive index is for\r\ndetermining the species to which a cut stone belongs. The values found\r\nfor different specimens of the species do in cases vary considerably\r\nowing to the great latitude possible in the chemical constitution\r\ndue to the isomorphous replacement of one element by another. Some\r\nvariation in the index may even occur in different directions within\r\nthe same stone; it results from the remarkable property of splitting up\r\na beam of light into two beams, which is possessed by many crystallized\r\nsubstances. This forms the subject of a later chapter.\r\n\r\nUpon the fact that the refractive index of a substance varies for\r\nlight of different colours depends such familiar phenomena as the\r\nsplendour of the rainbow and the ‘fire’ of the diamond. When white\r\nlight is refracted into a stone it no longer remains white, but is\r\nsplit up into a spectrum. Except in certain anomalous substances the\r\nrefractive index increases progressively as the wave-length of the\r\nlight decreases, and consequently a normal spectrum is violet at one\r\nend and passes through green and yellow to red at the other end. The\r\nwidth of the spectrum, which may be measured by the difference between\r\nthe refractive indices for the extreme red and violet rays, also\r\nvaries, though on the whole it increases with the refractive index. It\r\nis the dispersion, as this difference is termed, that determines the\r\n‘fire’—a character of the utmost importance in colourless transparent\r\nstones, which, but for it, would be lacking in interest. Diamond excels\r\nall colourless stones in this respect, although it is closely followed\r\nby zircon, the colour of which has been driven off by heating; it is,\r\nhowever, surpassed by two coloured species: sphene, which is seldom\r\nseen in jewellery, and demantoid, the green garnet from the Urals,\r\nwhich often passes under the misnomer ‘olivine.’ The dispersion of the\r\nmore prominent species for the _B_ and _G_ lines of the solar spectrum\r\nis given in Table IV at the end of the book.\r\n\r\nWe will now proceed to discuss methods that may be used for the\r\nmeasurement of the refractive indices of cut stones.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n                   MEASUREMENT OF REFRACTIVE INDICES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe methods available for the measurement of refractive indices are of\r\ntwo kinds, and make use of two different principles. The first, which\r\nis based upon the very simple relation found in the last chapter to\r\nsubsist at total-reflection, can be used with ease and celerity, and is\r\nbest suited for discriminative purposes; but it is restricted in its\r\napplication. The second, which depends on the measurement of the angle\r\nbetween two facets and the minimum deviation experienced by a ray of\r\nlight when traversing a prism formed by them, is more involved, entails\r\nthe use of more elaborate apparatus, and takes considerable time, but\r\nit is less restricted in its application.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  (1) THE METHOD OF TOTAL-REFLECTION\r\n\r\nWe see from equation _b_ (p. 18), connecting the angle of\r\ntotal-reflection with the refractive indices of the adjacent media,\r\nthat, if the denser medium be constant, the indices of all less dense\r\nmedia may be easily determined from a measurement of the corresponding\r\ncritical angle. In all refractometers the constant medium is a glass\r\nwith a high refractive index. Some instruments have rotatory parts, by\r\nmeans of which this angle is actually measured. Such instruments give\r\nvery good results, but suffer from the disadvantages of being neither\r\nportable nor convenient to handle, and of not giving a result without\r\nsome computation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16.—Refractometer (actual size).]\r\n\r\nFor use in the identification of cut stones, a refractometer with a\r\nfixed scale, such as that (Fig. 16) devised by the author, is far\r\nmore convenient. In order to facilitate the observations, a totally\r\nreflecting prism has been inserted between the two lenses of the\r\neyepiece. The eyepiece may be adjusted to suit the individual eyesight;\r\nbut for observers with exceptionally long sight an adapter is provided,\r\nwhich permits the eyepiece being drawn out to the requisite extent.\r\nThe refractometer must be held in the manner illustrated in Fig.\r\n17, so that the light from a window or other source of illumination\r\nenters the instrument by the lenticular opening underneath. Good,\r\neven illumination of the field may also very simply be secured by\r\nreflecting light into the instrument from a sheet of white paper laid\r\non a table. On looking down the eyepiece we see a scale (Fig. 18), the\r\neyepiece being, if necessary, focused until the divisions of the scale\r\nare clearly and distinctly seen. Suppose, for experiment, we smear a\r\nlittle vaseline or similar fatty substance on the plane surface of the\r\ndense glass, which just projects beyond the level of the brass plate\r\nembracing it. The field of view is now no longer uniformly illuminated,\r\nbut is divided into two parts (Fig. 19): a dark portion above, which\r\nterminates in a curved edge, apparently green in colour, and a bright\r\nportion underneath, which is composed of totally reflected light. If\r\nwe tilt the instrument downwards so that light enters the instrument\r\nfrom above through the vaseline we find that the portions of the field\r\nare reversed, the dark portion being underneath and terminated by\r\na red edge. It is possible so to arrange the illumination that the\r\ntwo portions are evenly lighted, and the common edge becomes almost\r\ninvisible. It is therefore essential for obtaining satisfactory results\r\nthat the plate and the dense glass be shielded from the light by the\r\ndisengaged hand. The shadow-edge is curved, and is, indeed, an arc of a\r\ncircle, because spherical surfaces are used in the optical arrangements\r\nof the refractometer; by the substitution of cylindrical surfaces it\r\nbecomes straight, but sufficient advantage is not secured thereby to\r\ncompensate for the greatly increased complexity of the construction.\r\nThe shadow-edge is coloured, because the relative dispersion,\r\n _n{v}_ − _n{r}_\r\n ——————————————— (_n{v}_ and _n{r}_ being the refractive indices for\r\n        _n_\r\nthe extreme violet and red rays respectively), of the vaseline differs\r\nfrom that of the dense glass. The dispersion of the glass is very\r\nhigh, and exceeds that of any stone for which it can be used. Certain\r\noils have, however, nearly the same relative dispersion, and the edges\r\ncorresponding to them are consequently almost colourless. A careful eye\r\nwill perceive that the coloured shadow-edge is in reality a spectrum,\r\nof which the violet end lies in the dark portion of the field and the\r\nred edge merges into the bright portion. The yellow colour of a sodium\r\nflame, which, as has already been stated, is selected as the standard\r\nfor the measurement of refractive indices, lies between the green and\r\nthe red, and the part of the spectrum to be noted is at the bottom of\r\nthe green, and practically, therefore, at the bottom of the shadow,\r\nbecause the yellow and red are almost lost in the brightness of the\r\nlower portion of the field. If a sodium flame be used as the source of\r\nillumination, the shadow-edge becomes a sharply defined line. The scale\r\nis so graduated and arranged that the reading where this line crosses\r\nthe scale gives the corresponding refractive index, the reading, since\r\nthe line is curved, being taken in the middle of the field on the\r\nright-hand side of the scale. The refractometer therefore gives at\r\nonce, without any intermediate calculation, a value of the refractive\r\nindex to the second place of decimals, and a skilled observer\r\nmay, by estimating the tenths of the intervals between successive\r\ndivisions, arrive at the third place; to facilitate this estimation\r\nthe semi-divisions beyond 1·650 have been inserted. The range extends\r\nnearly to 1·800; for any substance with a higher refractive index the\r\nfield is dark as far as the limit at the bottom.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17.—Method of Using the Refractometer.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18.—Scale of the Refractometer.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19.—Shadow-edge given by a singly refractive\r\nSubstance.]\r\n\r\nA fat, or a liquid, wets the glass, _i.e._ comes into intimate contact\r\nwith it, but if a solid substance be tested in the same way, a film of\r\nair would intervene and entirely prevent an observation. To displace\r\nit, a drop of some liquid which is more highly refractive than the\r\nsubstance under test must first be applied to the plane surface\r\nof the dense glass. The most convenient liquid for the purpose is\r\nmethylene iodide, CH_{2}I_{2}, which, when pure, has at ordinary room\r\ntemperatures a refractive index of 1·742. It is almost colourless when\r\nfresh, but turns reddish brown on exposure to light. If desired, it\r\nmay be cleared in the manner described below (p. 66), but the film\r\nof liquid actually used is so thin that this precaution is scarcely\r\nnecessary. If we test a piece of ordinary glass—one of the slips used\r\nby microscopists for covering thin sections is very convenient for\r\nthe purpose—first applying a drop of methylene iodide to the plane\r\nsurface of the dense glass of the refractometer (Fig. 20), we notice a\r\ncoloured shadow-edge corresponding to the glass-slip at about 1·530 and\r\nanother, almost colourless, at 1·742, which corresponds to the liquid.\r\nIf the solid substance which is tested is more highly refractive than\r\nmethylene iodide, only the latter of the shadow-edges is visible, and\r\nwe must utilize some more refractive liquid. We can, however, raise\r\nthe refractive index of methylene iodide by dissolving sulphur[2] in\r\nit; the refractive index of the saturated liquid lies well beyond\r\n1·800 and the shadow-edge corresponding to it, therefore, does not\r\ncome within the range of the refractometer. The pure and the saturated\r\nliquids can be procured with the instrument, the bottles containing\r\nthem being japanned on the outside to exclude light and fitted with\r\ndipping-stoppers, by means of which a drop of the liquid required is\r\neasily transferred to the surface of the glass of the instrument.\r\nSo long as the liquid is more highly refractive than the stone, or\r\nwhatever may be the substance under examination, its precise refractive\r\nindex is of no consequence. The facet used in the test must be flat,\r\nand must be pressed firmly on the instrument, so that it is truly\r\nparallel to the plane surface of the dense glass; for good results,\r\nmoreover, it must be bright.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20.—Faceted Stone in Position on the Refractometer.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 21.—Shadow-edges given by a doubly refractive\r\nsubstance.]\r\n\r\nWe have so far assumed that the substance which we are testing is\r\nsimple and gives a single shadow-edge; but, as may be seen from Table\r\nV, many of the gem-stones are doubly refractive, and such will,\r\nin general, show in the field of the refractometer two distinct\r\nshadow-edges more or less widely separated. Suppose, for example, we\r\nstudy the effect produced by a peridot, which displays the phenomenon\r\nto a marked degree. If we revolve the stone so that the facet under\r\nobservation remains parallel to the plane surface of the dense glass\r\nof the refractometer and in contact with it, we notice that both the\r\nshadow-edges in general move up or down the scale. In particular cases,\r\ndepending upon the relation of the position of the facet selected to\r\nthe crystalline symmetry, one or both of them may remain fixed, or\r\none may even move across the other. But whatever facet of the stone\r\nbe used for the test, and however variable be the movements of the\r\nshadow-edges, the highest and lowest readings obtainable remain the\r\nsame; they are the principal indices of refraction, such as are stated\r\nin Table III at the end of the book, and their difference measures\r\nthe maximum amount of double refraction possessed by the stone. The\r\nprocedure is therefore simplicity itself; we have merely to revolve\r\nthe stone on the instrument, usually through not more than a right\r\nangle, and note the greatest and least readings. It will be noticed\r\nthat the shadow-edges cross the scale symmetrically in the critical and\r\nskewwise in intermediate positions. Fig. 21 represents the effect when\r\nthe facet is such as to give simultaneously the two readings required.\r\nThe shadow-edges _a_ and _b_, which are coloured in white light,\r\ncorrespond to the least and greatest respectively of the principal\r\nrefractive indices, while the third shadow-edge, which is very faint,\r\ncorresponds to the liquid used—methylene iodide. It is possible, as we\r\nshall see in a later chapter, to learn from the motion, if any, of the\r\nshadow-edges something as to the character of the double refraction.\r\nSince, however, each shadow-edge is spectral in white light, they will\r\nnot be distinctly separate unless the double refraction exceeds the\r\nrelative dispersion. Topaz, for instance, appears in white light to\r\nyield only a single shadow-edge, and may thus easily be distinguished\r\nfrom tourmaline, in which the double refraction is large enough for\r\nthe separation of the two shadow-edges to be clearly discerned. In\r\nsodium light, however, no difficulty is experienced in distinguishing\r\nboth the shadow-edges given by substances with small amount of double\r\nrefraction, such as chrysoberyl, quartz, and topaz, and a skilled\r\nobserver may detect the separation in the extreme instances of apatite,\r\nidocrase, and beryl. The shadow-edge corresponding to the greater\r\nrefractive index is always less distinct, because it lies in the bright\r\nportion of the field. If the stone or its facet be small, it must\r\nbe moved on the plane surface of the dense glass until the greatest\r\npossible distinctness is imparted to the edge or edges. If it be moved\r\ntowards the observer from the further end, a misty shadow appears to\r\nmove down the scale until the correct position is reached, when the\r\nedges spring into view.\r\n\r\nAny facet of a stone may be utilized so long as it is flat, but the\r\ntable-facet is the most convenient, because it is usually the largest,\r\nand it is available even when the stone is mounted. That the stone need\r\nnot be removed from its setting is one of the great advantages of this\r\nmethod. The smaller the stone the more difficult it is to manipulate;\r\ncaution especially must be exercised that it be not tilted, not only\r\nbecause the shadow-edge would be shifted from its true position and an\r\nerroneous value of the refractive index obtained, but also because a\r\ncorner or edge of the stone would inevitably scratch the glass of the\r\ninstrument, which is far softer than the hard gem-stones. Methylene\r\niodide will in time attack and stain the glass, and must therefore be\r\nwiped off the instrument immediately after use.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  (2) THE METHOD OF MINIMUM DEVIATION\r\n\r\nIf the stone be too highly refractive for a measurement of its\r\nrefractive index to be possible with the refractometer just described,\r\nand it is desired to determine this constant, recourse must be had\r\nto the prismatic method, for which purpose an instrument known as\r\na goniometer[3] is required. Two angles must be measured; one the\r\ninterior angle included between a suitable pair of facets, and the\r\nother the minimum amount of the deviation produced by the pair upon a\r\nbeam of light traversing them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 22.—Path at Minimum Deviation of a Ray traversing a\r\nPrism formed of two Facets of a Cut Stone.]\r\n\r\nFig. 22 represents a section of a step-cut stone perpendicular to a\r\nseries of facets with parallel edges; _t_ is the table, and _a, b, c_,\r\nare facets on the culet side. The path of light traversing the prism\r\nformed by the pair of facets, _t_ and _b_, is indicated. Suppose that\r\n_A_ is the interior angle of the prism, _i_ the angle of incidence of\r\nlight at the first facet and _i´_ the angle of emergence at the second\r\nfacet, and _r_ and _r´_ the angles inside the stone at the two facets\r\nrespectively. Then at the first facet light has been bent through an\r\nangle _i - r_, and again at the second facet through an angle _i´ -\r\nr´_; the angle of deviation, _D_, is therefore given by\r\n\r\n                       _D = i + i´ - (r + r´)_.\r\n\r\nWe have further that\r\n\r\n                             _r + r´ = A_,\r\n\r\nwhence it follows that\r\n\r\n                           _A + D = i + i´._\r\n\r\nIf the stone be mounted on the goniometer and adjusted so that the\r\nedge of the prism is parallel to the axis of rotation of the instrument\r\nand if light from the collimator fall upon the table-facet and the\r\ntelescope be turned to the proper position to receive the emergent\r\nbeam, a spectral image of the object-slit, or in the case of a doubly\r\nrefractive stone in general, two spectral images, will be seen in\r\nwhite light; in the light of a sodium flame the images will be sharp\r\nand distinct. Suppose that we rotate the stone in the direction of\r\ndiminishing deviation and simultaneously the telescope so as to retain\r\nan image in the field of view, we find that the image moves up to and\r\nthen away from a certain position, at which, therefore, the deviation\r\nis a minimum. The image moves in the same direction from this position\r\nwhichever way the stone be rotated. The question then arises what are\r\nthe angles of incidence and refraction under these special conditions.\r\nIt is clear that a path of light is reversible; that is to say, if a\r\nbeam of light traverses the prism from the facet _t_ to the facet _b_\r\nit can take precisely the same path from the facet _b_ to the facet\r\n_t_. Hence we should be led to expect that, since experiment teaches us\r\nthat there is only one position of minimum deviation corresponding to\r\nthe same pair of facets, the angles at the two facets must be equal,\r\n_i.e._ _i = i´_, and _r = r´_. It is, indeed, not difficult to prove by\r\neither geometrical or analytical methods that such is the case.\r\n\r\n                                     _A_           _A_ + _D_\r\nTherefore at minimum deviation _r_ = ——— and _i_ = —————————, and,\r\n                                      2                2\r\nsince sin _i_ = _n_ sin _r_, where _n_ is the refractive index of\r\nthe stone, we have the simple relation—\r\n                              _A_ + _D_\r\n                          sin —————————\r\n                                  2\r\n                    _n_ = —————————————\r\n                                 _A_\r\n                             sin ———\r\n                                  2\r\n\r\nThis relation is strictly true only when the direction of minimum\r\ndeviation is one of crystalline symmetry in the stone, and holds\r\ntherefore in general for all singly refractive stones, and for the\r\nordinary ray of a uniaxial stone; but the values thus obtained even in\r\nthe case of biaxial stones are approximate enough for discriminative\r\npurposes. If then the stone be singly refractive, the result is the\r\nindex required; if it be uniaxial, one value is the ordinary index\r\nand the other image gives a value lying between the ordinary and the\r\nextraordinary indices; if it be biaxial, the values given by the two\r\nimages may lie anywhere between the greatest and the least refractive\r\nindices. The angle _A_ must not be too large; otherwise the light will\r\nnot emerge at the second facet, but will be totally reflected inside\r\nthe stone: on the other hand, it must not be too small, because any\r\nerror in its determination would then seriously affect the accuracy of\r\nthe value derived for the refractive index. Although the monochromatic\r\nlight of a sodium flame is essential for precise work, a sufficiently\r\napproximate value for discriminative purposes is obtained by noting the\r\nposition of the yellow portion of the spectral image given in white\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nIn the case of a stone such as that depicted in Fig. 22 images are\r\ngiven by other pairs of facets, for instance _ta_ and _tc_, unless the\r\nangle included by the former is too large. There might therefore be\r\nsome doubt, to which pair some particular image corresponded; but no\r\nconfusion can arise if the following procedure be adopted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 23.—Course of Observations in the Method of Minimum\r\nDeviation.]\r\n\r\nThe table, or some easily recognizable facet, is selected as the facet\r\nat which light enters the stone. The telescope is first placed in the\r\nposition in which it is directly opposite the collimator (_T_{0}_ in\r\nFig. 23), and clamped. The scale is turned until it reads exactly\r\nzero, 0° or 360°, and clamped. The telescope is released and revolved\r\nin the direction of increasing readings of the scale to the position\r\nof minimum deviation, _T_. The reading of the scale gives at once the\r\nangle of minimum deviation, _D_. The holder carrying the stone is now\r\nclamped to the scale, and the telescope is turned to the position,\r\n_T_{1}_,in which the image given by reflection from the table facet is\r\nin the centre of the field of view; the reading of the scale is taken.\r\nThe telescope is clamped, and the scale is released and rotated until\r\nit reads the angle already found for _D_. If no mistake has been made,\r\nthe reflected image from the second facet is now in the field of view.\r\nIt will probably not be quite central, as theoretically it should be,\r\nbecause the stone may not have been originally quite in the position\r\nof minimum deviation, a comparatively large rotation of the stone\r\nproducing no apparent change in the position of the refracted image at\r\nminimum deviation, and further, because, as has already been stated,\r\nthe method is not strictly true for biaxial stones. The difference in\r\nreadings, however, should not exceed 2°. The reading, _S_, of the scale\r\nis now taken, and it together with 180° subtracted from the reading for\r\nthe first facet, and the value of _A_, the interior angle between the\r\ntwo facets, obtained.\r\n\r\nLet us take an example.\r\n\r\n         Reading _T_ (= _D_) 40° 41´  Reading T_{1}  261° 35´\r\n                                          less 180°  180   0\r\n                                                     ———————\r\n                                                      81  35\r\n                                      Reading _S_     41  30\r\n                                                     ———————\r\n                       ½_D_  20  20½          _A_     40   5\r\n                       ½_A_  20   2½         ½_A_     20   2½\r\n                             ———————\r\n                ½(_A_ + _D_) 40  23\r\n\r\n                      Log sin 40° 23´   9.81151\r\n                      Log sin 20   2½   9.53492\r\n                                        ———————\r\n                        Log _n_         0.27659\r\n\r\n                             _n_ = 1.8906.\r\n\r\nThe readings _S_ and _T_ are very nearly the same, and therefore we may\r\nbe sure that no mistake has been made in the selection of the facets.\r\n\r\nIn place of logarithm-tables we may make use of the diagram on Plate\r\nII. The radial lines correspond to the angles of minimum deviation and\r\nthe skew lines to the prism angles, and the distance along the radial\r\nlines gives the refractive index. We run our eye along the line for the\r\nobserved angle of minimum deviation and note where it meets the curve\r\nfor the observed prism angle; the refractive index corresponding to the\r\npoint of intersection is at once read off.\r\n\r\nThis method has several obvious disadvantages: it requires the use\r\nof an expensive and elaborate instrument, an observation takes\r\nconsiderable time, and the values of the principal refractive indices\r\ncannot in general be immediately determined.\r\n\r\nTable III at the end of the book gives the refractive indices of the\r\ngem-stones.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PLATE II_\r\n\r\nREFRACTIVE INDEX DIAGRAM]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V\r\n\r\n                           LUSTRE AND SHEEN\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has been already stated that whenever light in one medium falls\r\nupon the surface separating it from another medium some of the light\r\nis reflected within the first, while the remainder passes out into\r\nthe second medium, except when the first is of lower refractivity\r\nthan the second and light falls at an angle greater than that of\r\ntotal-reflection. Similarly, when light impinges upon a cut stone\r\nsome of it is reflected and the remainder passes into the stone. What\r\nis the relative amount of reflected light depends upon the nature of\r\nthe stone—its refractivity and hardness—and determines its lustre;\r\nthe greater the amount the more lustrous will the stone appear. There\r\nare different kinds of lustre, and the intensity of each depends on\r\nthe polish of the surface. From a dull, _i.e._ an uneven, surface the\r\nreflected light is scattered, and there are no brilliant reflections.\r\nAll gem-stones take a good polish, and have therefore, so long as the\r\nsurface retains its polish, considerable brilliancy; turquoise, on\r\naccount of its softness, is always comparatively dull.\r\n\r\nThe different kinds of lustre are—\r\n\r\n  (1) Adamantine, characteristic of diamond.\r\n  (2) Vitreous, as seen on the surface of fractured glass.\r\n  (3) Resinous, as shown by resins.\r\n\r\nZircon and demantoid, the green garnet called by jewellers “olivine,”\r\nalone among gem-stones have a lustre approaching that of diamond. The\r\nremainder all have a vitreous lustre, though varying in degree, the\r\nharder and the more refractive species being on the whole the more\r\nlustrous.\r\n\r\nSome stones—for instance, a cinnamon garnet—appear to have a certain\r\ngreasiness in the lustre, which is caused by stray reflections from\r\ninclusions or other breaks in the homogeneity of the interior. A pearly\r\nlustre, which arises from cleavage cracks and is typically displayed\r\nby the cleavage face of topaz, would be seen in a cut stone only when\r\nflawed.\r\n\r\nCertain corundums when viewed in the direction of the\r\ncrystallographical axis display six narrow lines of light radiating at\r\nangles of 60° from a centre in a manner suggestive of the conventional\r\nrepresentations of stars. Such stones are consequently known as\r\nasterias, or more usually star-stones—star-rubies or star-sapphires, as\r\nthe case may be, and the phenomenon is called asterism. These stones\r\nhave not a homogeneous structure, but contain tube-like cavities\r\nregularly arranged at angles of 60° in planes at right angles to the\r\ncrystallographical axis. The effect is best produced when the stones\r\nare cut _en cabochon_ perpendicular to that axis.\r\n\r\nChatoyancy is a somewhat similar phenomenon, but in this case the\r\nfibres or cavities are parallel to a single direction, and a single\r\nbroadish band is displayed at right angles to it. Cat’s-eyes, as these\r\nstones are termed, are cut _en cabochon_ parallel to the fibres. The\r\ntrue cat’s-eye (Plate XXIX, Fig. 1) is a variety of chrysoberyl, but\r\nthe term is also often applied to quartz showing a similar appearance.\r\nThe latter is really a fibrous mineral, such as asbestos, which has\r\nbecome converted into silica. The beautiful tiger’s-eye from South\r\nAfrica is a silicified crocidolite, the original blue colour of which\r\nhas been altered by oxidation to golden brown. Recently tourmalines\r\nhave been discovered which are sufficiently fibrous in structure to\r\ndisplay an effective chatoyancy.\r\n\r\nThe milky sheen of moonstone (Plate XXIX, Fig. 4) owes its effect to\r\nreflections from twin lamellæ. The wonderful iridescence which is\r\nthe glory of opal, and is therefore termed opalescence, arises from\r\na structure which is peculiar to that species. Opal is a solidified\r\njelly; on cooling it has become riddled with extremely thin cracks,\r\nwhich were subsequently filled with similar material of slightly\r\ndifferent refractivity, and thus it consists of a series of films. At\r\nthe surface of each film interference of light takes place just as\r\nat the surface of a soap-bubble, and the more evenly the films are\r\nspaced apart the more uniform is the colour displayed, the actual tint\r\ndepending upon the thickness of the films traversed by the light giving\r\nrise to the phenomenon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n                           DOUBLE REFRACTION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe optical phenomenon presented by many gem-stones is complicated\r\nby their property of splitting up a beam of light into two with, in\r\ngeneral, differing characters. In this chapter we shall discuss the\r\nnature of double refraction, as it is termed, and methods for its\r\ndetection. The phenomenon is not one that comes within the purview of\r\neveryday experience.\r\n\r\nSo long ago as 1669 a Danish physician, by name Bartholinus, noticed\r\nthat a plate of the transparent mineral which at that time had\r\nrecently been brought over from Iceland, and was therefore called\r\n“Iceland-spar,” possessed the remarkable property of giving a double\r\nimage of objects close to it when viewed through it. Subsequent\r\ninvestigation has shown that much crystallized matter is doubly\r\nrefractive, but in calcite—to use the scientific name for the species\r\nwhich includes Iceland-spar—alone among common minerals is the\r\nphenomenon so conspicuous as to be obvious to the unaided eye. The\r\napparent separation of the pair of images given by a plate cut or\r\ncleaved in any direction depends upon its thickness. The large mass,\r\nupwards of two feet (60 cm.) in thickness, which is exhibited at\r\nthe far end of the Mineral Gallery of the British Museum (Natural\r\nHistory), displays the separation to a degree that is probably unique.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 24.—Apparent doubling of the Edges of a Peridot\r\nwhen viewed through the Table-Facet.]\r\n\r\nAlthough none of the gem-stones can emulate calcite in this character,\r\nyet the double refraction of certain of them is large enough to be\r\ndetected without much difficulty. In the case of faceted stones the\r\nopposite edges should be viewed through the table-facet, and any signs\r\nof doubling noted. The double refraction of sphene is so large, viz.\r\n0·08, that the doubling of the edges is evident to the unaided eye.\r\nIn peridot (Fig. 24), zircon (b), and epidote the apparent separation\r\nof the edges is easily discerned with the assistance of an ordinary\r\nlens. A keen eye can detect the phenomenon even in the case of such\r\nsubstances as quartz with small double refraction. It must, however, be\r\nremembered that in all such stones the refraction is single in certain\r\ndirections, and the amount of double refraction varies therefore\r\nwith the direction from nil to the maximum possessed by the stone.\r\nExperiment with a plate of Iceland-spar shows that the rays transmitted\r\nby it have properties differing from those of ordinary light. On\r\nsuperposing a second plate we notice that there are now two pairs of\r\nimages, which are in general no longer of equal brightness, as was the\r\ncase before. If the second plate be rotated with respect to the first,\r\ntwo images, one of each pair, disappear, and then the other two, the\r\nplate having turned through a right angle between the two positions of\r\nextinction; midway between these positions the images are all equally\r\nbright. This variation of intensity implies that each of the rays\r\nemerging from the first plate has acquired a one-sided character, or,\r\nas it is usually expressed, has become plane-polarized, or, shortly,\r\npolarized.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 25.—Wave-Motion.]\r\n\r\nBefore the discovery of the phenomenon of double refraction the\r\nfoundation of the modern theory of light had been laid by the genius of\r\nHuygens. According to this theory light is the result of a wave-motion\r\n(Fig. 25) in the ether, a medium that pervades the whole of space\r\nwhether occupied by matter or not, and transmits the wave-motion at a\r\nrate varying with the matter with which it happens to coincide. Such\r\na medium has been assumed because it explains satisfactorily all the\r\nphenomena of light, but it by no means follows that it has a concrete\r\nexistence. Indeed, if it has, it is so tenuous as to be imperceptible\r\nto the most delicate experiments. The wave-motion is similar to that\r\nobserved on the surface of still water when disturbed by a stone flung\r\ninto it. The waves spread out from the source of disturbance; but,\r\nalthough the waves seem to advance, the actual particles of water\r\nmerely move up and down, and have no motion at all in the direction\r\nin which the waves are moving. If we imagine similar motion to take\r\nplace in any plane and not only the horizontal, we form some idea\r\nof the nature of ordinary light. But after passing through a plate\r\nof Iceland-spar, light no longer vibrates in all directions, but in\r\neach beam the vibrations are parallel to a particular plane, the two\r\nplanes being at right angles. The exact relation of the direction of\r\nthe vibrations to the plane of polarization is uncertain, although it\r\nundoubtedly lies in the plane containing the direction of the ray of\r\nlight and the perpendicular to the plane of polarization. The waves for\r\ndifferent colours differ in their length, _i.e._ in the distance, 2\r\n_bb_ (Fig. 25), from crest to crest, while the velocity, which remains\r\nthe same for the same medium, is proportional to the wave-length. The\r\nintensity of the light varies as the square of the amplitude of the\r\nwave, _i.e._ the height, _ab_, of the crest from the mean level.\r\n\r\nVarious methods have been proposed for obtaining polarized light. Thus\r\nSeebeck found in 1813 that a plate of brown tourmaline cut parallel\r\nto the crystallographic axis and of sufficient thickness (cf. p. 11)\r\ntransmits only one ray, the other being entirely absorbed within the\r\nplate. Another method was to employ a glass plate to reflect light at a\r\ncertain critical angle. The most efficient method, and that in general\r\nuse at the present day, is due to the invention of Nicol. A rhomb of\r\nIceland-spar (Fig. 26), of suitable length, is sliced along the longer\r\ndiagonal, _dd_, and the halves are cemented together by means of canada\r\nbalsam. One ray, _ioo_, is totally reflected at the surface separating\r\nthe mineral and the cement, and does not penetrate into the other half;\r\nwhile the other ray, _iee_, is transmitted with almost undiminished\r\nintensity. Such a rhomb is called a Nicol’s prism after its inventor,\r\nor briefly, a nicol.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 26.—Nicol’s Prism.]\r\n\r\nIf one nicol be placed above another and their corresponding principal\r\nplanes be at right angles no light is transmitted through the pair.\r\nIn the polarizing microscope one such nicol, called the polarizer, is\r\nplaced below the stage, and the other, called the analyser, is either\r\ninserted in the body of the microscope or placed above the eyepiece,\r\nand the pair are usually set in the crossed position so that the field\r\nof the microscope is dark. If a piece of glass or a fragment of some\r\nsingly refractive substance be placed on the stage the field still\r\nremains dark; but in case of a doubly refractive stone the field is\r\nno longer dark except in certain positions of the stone. On rotation\r\nof the plate, or, if possible, of the nicols together, the field\r\npasses from darkness to maximum brightness four times in a complete\r\nrevolution, the relative angular intervals between these positions\r\nbeing right angles. These positions of darkness are known as the\r\npositions of extinction, and the plate is said to extinguish in them.\r\nThis test is exceedingly delicate and reveals the double refraction\r\neven when the greatest difference in the refractive indices is too\r\nsmall to be measured directly.\r\n\r\nDoubly refractive substances are of two kinds: uniaxial, in which\r\nthere is one direction of single refraction, and biaxial, in which\r\nthere are two such directions. In the case of the former the direction\r\nof one, the ordinary ray, is precisely the same as if the refraction\r\nwere single, but the refractive index of the other ray varies from\r\nthat of the ordinary ray to a second limiting value, the extraordinary\r\nrefractive index, which may be either greater or less. If the\r\nextraordinary is greater than the ordinary refractive index the double\r\nrefraction is said to be positive; if less, to be negative. A biaxial\r\nsubstance is more complex. It possesses three principal directions,\r\nviz., the bisectrices of the directions of single refraction and the\r\nperpendicular to the plane containing them. The first two correspond\r\nto the greatest and least, and the last to the mean of the principal\r\nindices of refraction. If the acute bisectrix corresponds to the\r\nleast refractive index, the double refraction is said to be positive,\r\nand if to the greatest, negative. The relation of the directions of\r\nsingle refraction, _s_, to the three principal directions, _a, b, c_,\r\nis illustrated in Fig. 27 for the case of topaz, a positive mineral.\r\nThe refractive indices of the rays traversing one of the principal\r\ndirections have the values corresponding to the other two. In the\r\ndirection _a_ we should measure the greatest and the mean of the\r\nprincipal refractive indices, in the direction _b_ the greatest and the\r\nleast, and in the direction _c_ the mean and the least. The maximum\r\namount of double refraction is therefore in the direction _b_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 27.—Relation of the two Directions of single\r\nRefraction to the principal Optical Directions in a Biaxial Crystal.]\r\n\r\nIn the examination of a faceted stone, of the most usual shape, the\r\nsimplest method is to lay the large facet, called the table, on a glass\r\nslip and view the stone through the small parallel facet, the culet.\r\nShould the latter not exist, it may frequently happen that owing to\r\ninternal reflection no light emerges through the steeply inclined\r\nfacets. This difficulty is easily overcome by immersing the stone in\r\nsome highly refracting oil. A glass plate held by hand over the stone\r\nwith a drop of the oil between it and the plate serves the purpose, and\r\nis perhaps a more convenient method. A stone which does not possess a\r\npair of parallel facets should be viewed through any pair which are\r\nnearly parallel.\r\n\r\nWe have stated that a plate of glass has no effect on the field.\r\nSuppose, however, it were viewed when placed between the jaws of a\r\ntightened vice and thus thrown into a state of strain, it would then\r\nshow double refraction, the amount of which would depend on the strain.\r\nNatural singly refractive substances frequently show phenomena of a\r\nsimilar kind. Thus diamond sometimes contains a drop of liquid carbonic\r\nacid, and the strain is revealed by the coloured rings surrounding\r\nthe cavity which are seen when the stone is viewed between crossed\r\nnicols. Double refraction is also common in diamond even when there is\r\nno included matter to explain it, and is caused by the state of strain\r\ninto which the mineral is thrown on release from the enormous pressure\r\nunder which it was formed. Other minerals which display these so-called\r\noptical anomalies, such as fluor and garnet, are not really quite\r\nsingly refractive at ordinary temperatures; each crystal is composed\r\nof several double refractive individuals. But all such phenomena\r\ncannot be confused with the characters of minerals which extinguish\r\nin the ordinary way, since the stone will extinguish in small patches\r\nand these will not be dark all at the same time; further, the double\r\nrefraction is small, and on revolving the stone between crossed nicols\r\nthe extinction is not sharp. Paste stones are sometimes in a state of\r\nstrain, and display slight, but general, double refraction. Hence the\r\nexistence of double refraction does not necessarily prove that the\r\nstone is real and not an imitation. Stones may be composed of two or\r\nmore individuals which are related to each other by twinning, in which\r\ncase each individual would in general extinguish separately. Such\r\nindividuals would be larger and would extinguish more sharply than the\r\npatches of an anomalous stone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 28.—Interference of Light.]\r\n\r\nAn examination in convergent light is sometimes of service. An\r\nauxiliary lens is placed over the condenser so as to converge the light\r\non to the stone. Light now traverses the stone in different directions;\r\nthe more oblique the direction the greater the distance traversed in\r\nthe stone. If it be doubly refractive, in any given direction there\r\nwill be in general two rays with differing refractive indices and the\r\nresulting effect is akin to the well-known phenomenon of Newton’s\r\nrings, and is an instance of what is termed interference. It may be\r\nmentioned that the interference of light (Fig. 28) explains such common\r\nphenomena as the colours of a soap-bubble, the hues of tarnished steel,\r\nthe tints of a layer of oil floating on water, and so on. Light, after\r\ndiverging from the stone, comes to focus a little beneath the plane\r\nin which the image of the stone is formed. An auxiliary lens must,\r\ntherefore, be inserted to bring the focal planes together, so that the\r\ninterference picture may be viewed by means of the same eyepiece.\r\n\r\nIf a uniaxial crystal be examined along the crystallographic axis in\r\nconvergent light an interference picture will be seen of the kind\r\nillustrated on Plate III. The arms of a black cross meet in the centre\r\nof the field, which is surrounded by a series of circular rings,\r\ncoloured in white light. Rotation of the stone about the axis\r\nproduces no change in the picture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PLATE III_\r\n\r\n1. UNIAXIAL\r\n\r\n2. UNIAXIAL (_Circular Polarization_)\r\n\r\n3. BIAXIAL (_Crossed Brushes_)\r\n\r\n4. BIAXIAL (_Hyperbolic Brushes_)\r\n\r\nINTERFERENCE FIGURES]\r\n\r\nA biaxial substance possesses two directions (_the optic axes_) along\r\nwhich a single beam is transmitted. If such a stone be examined along\r\nthe line bisecting the acute angle between the optic axes (_the acute\r\nbisectrix_) an interference picture[4] will be seen which in particular\r\npositions of the stone with respect to the crossed nicols takes the\r\nforms illustrated on Plate III. As before, there is a series of rings\r\nwhich are coloured in white light; they, however, are no longer circles\r\nbut consist of curves known as lemniscates, of which the figure of 8\r\nis a special form. Instead of an unchangeable cross there are a pair\r\nof black “brushes” which in one position of the stone are hyperbolæ,\r\nand in that at right angles become a cross. On rotating the stone we\r\nfind that the rings move with it and are unaltered in form, whereas the\r\nbrushes revolve about two points, called the “eyes,” where the optic\r\naxes emerge. If the observation were made along the obtuse bisectrix\r\nthe angle between the optic axes would probably be too large for the\r\nbrushes to come into the field, and the rings might not be visible in\r\nwhite light, though they would appear in monochromatic light. In the\r\ncase of a substance like sphene the figure is not so simple, because\r\nthe positions of the optic axes vary greatly for the different colours\r\nand the result is exceedingly complex; in monochromatic light, however,\r\nthe usual figure is visible.\r\n\r\nIt would probably not be possible in the case of a faceted stone\r\nto find a pair of faces perpendicular to the required direction.\r\nNevertheless, so long as a portion of the figures described is in the\r\nfield of view, the character of the double refraction, whether uniaxial\r\nor biaxial, may readily be determined.\r\n\r\nThere is yet another remarkable phenomenon which must not be passed\r\nover. Certain substances, of which quartz is a conspicuous example and\r\nin this respect unique among the gem-stones, possess the remarkable\r\nproperty of rotating the plane of polarization of a ray of light which\r\nis transmitted parallel to the optic axis. If a plate of quartz be\r\ncut at right angles to the axis and placed between crossed nicols in\r\nwhite light, the field will be coloured, the hue changing on rotation\r\nof one nicol with respect to the other. Examination in monochromatic\r\nlight shows that the field will become dark after a certain rotation of\r\nthe one nicol with respect to the other, the amount of which depends\r\non the thickness of the plate. If the plate be viewed in convergent\r\nlight, an interference picture is seen as illustrated on Plate III,\r\nwhich is similar to, and yet differs in some important particulars\r\nfrom the ordinary interference picture of a uniaxial stone. The cross\r\ndoes not penetrate beyond the innermost ring and the centre of the\r\nfield is coloured in white light. If a stone shows such a picture, it\r\nmay be safely assumed to be quartz. It is interesting to note that\r\nminerals which possess this property have a spiral arrangement of the\r\nconstituent atoms.\r\n\r\nIt has already been remarked (p. 28) that if a faceted doubly\r\nrefractive stone be rotated with one facet always in contact with the\r\ndense glass of the refractometer the pair of shadow-edges that are\r\nvisible in the field move up or down the scale in general from or\r\nto maximum and minimum positions. The manner in which this movement\r\ntakes place depends upon the character of the double refraction and\r\nthe position of the facet under observation with regard to the optical\r\nsymmetry of the stone. In the case of a uniaxial stone, if the facet\r\nbe perpendicular to the crystallographic axis, i.e. the direction\r\nof single refraction, neither of the shadow-edges will move. If the\r\nfacet be parallel to that direction, one shadow-edge will move up and\r\ncoincide with the other, which remains invariable in position, and\r\naway from it to a second critical position; the latter gives the value\r\nof the extraordinary refractive index, and the invariable shadow-edge\r\ncorresponds to the ordinary refractive index. This phenomenon is\r\ndisplayed by the table-facet of most tourmalines, because for\r\nreasons given above (p. 11) they are as a rule cut parallel to the\r\ncrystallographic axis. In the case of facets in intermediate positions,\r\nthe shadow-edge corresponding to the extraordinary refractive index\r\nmoves, but not to coincidence with the invariable shadow-edge. The case\r\nof a biaxial stone is more complex. If the facet be perpendicular to\r\none of the principal directions one shadow-edge remains invariable in\r\nposition, corresponding to one of the principal refractive indices,\r\nwhilst the other moves between the critical values corresponding\r\nto the remaining two of the principal refractive indices. In the\r\ninteresting case in which the facet is parallel to the two directions\r\nof single refraction, the second shadow-edge moves across the one which\r\nis invariable in position. In intermediate positions of the facet\r\nboth shadow-edges move, and give therefore critical values. Of the\r\nintermediate pair, _i.e._ the lower maximum and the higher minimum,\r\none corresponds to the mean principal refractive index, and the other\r\ndepends upon the relation of the facet to the optical symmetry. If it\r\nis desired to distinguish between them, observations must be made on\r\na second facet; but for discriminative purposes such exactitude is\r\nunnecessary, since the least and the greatest refractive indices are\r\nall that are required.\r\n\r\nThe character of the refraction of gem-stones is given in Table V at\r\nthe end of the book.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n              ABSORPTION EFFECTS: COLOUR, DICHROISM, ETC.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen white light passes through a cut stone, colour effects result\r\nwhich arise from a variety of causes. The most obvious is the\r\nfundamental colour of the stone, which is due to its selective\r\nabsorption of the light passing through it, and would characterize\r\nit before it was cut. Intermingled with the colour in a transparent\r\nstone is the dispersive effect known as ‘fire,’ which has already\r\nbeen discussed (p. 20). In many instances the want of homogeneity is\r\nresponsible for some peculiar effects such as opalescence, chatoyancy,\r\nand asterism. These phenomena will now be considered in fuller detail.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                COLOUR\r\n\r\nAll substances absorb light to some extent. If the action is slight and\r\naffects equally the whole of the visible spectrum, the stone appears\r\nwhite or colourless. Usually some portion is more strongly absorbed\r\nthan the rest, and the stone seems to be coloured. What is the precise\r\ntint depends not only upon the portions transmitted through the stone,\r\nbut also upon their relative intensities. The eye, unlike the ear, has\r\nnot the power of analysis and it cannot of itself determine how a\r\ncomposite colour has been made up. Indeed, so far as it is concerned,\r\nany colour may be exactly matched by compounding in certain proportions\r\nthree simple primary colours—red, yellow, and violet. Alexandrite, a\r\nvariety of chrysoberyl, is a curious and instructive case. The balance\r\nin the spectrum of light transmitted through it is such that, whereas\r\nin daylight such stones appear green, in artificial light, especially\r\nin gas-light, they are a pronounced raspberry-red (Plate XXVII,\r\nFigs. 11, 13). The phenomenon is intensified by the strong dichroism\r\ncharacteristic of this species.\r\n\r\nThe colour is the least reliable character that may be employed for the\r\nidentification of a stone, since it varies considerably in the same\r\nspecies, and often results from the admixture of some metallic oxide,\r\nwhich has no essential part in the chemical composition and is present\r\nin such minute quantities as to be almost imperceptible by analysis.\r\nWho would, for instance, imagine from their appearance that stones so\r\nmarkedly diverse in hue as ruby and sapphire were really varieties of\r\nthe same species, corundum? Again, quartz, in spite of the simplicity\r\nof its composition, displays extreme differences of tint. Nevertheless,\r\ncertain varieties do possess a distinctive colour, emerald being\r\nthe most striking example, and in other cases the trained eye can\r\nappreciate certain characteristic subtleties of shade. At any rate, the\r\ncolour is the most obvious of the physical characters, and serves to\r\nprovide a rough division of the species, and accordingly in Table II at\r\nthe end of the book the gem-stones are arranged by their usual tints.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               DICHROISM\r\n\r\nThe two rays into which a doubly refractive stone splits up a ray of\r\nlight are often differently absorbed by it, and in consequence appear\r\non emergence differently coloured; such stones are said to be dichroic.\r\nThe most striking instance is a deep-brown tourmaline, which, except\r\nin very thin sections, is quite opaque to the ordinary ray. The light\r\ntransmitted by a plate cut parallel to the crystallographic axis is\r\ntherefore plane-polarized; before the invention by Nicol of the prism\r\nof Iceland-spar known by his name this was the ordinary method of\r\nobtaining light of this character (cf. p. 43). Again, in the case of\r\nkunzite and cordierite the difference in colour is so marked as to be\r\nobvious to the unaided eye; but where the contrast is less pronounced\r\nwe require the use of an instrument called a dichroscope, which enables\r\nthe twin colours to be seen side by side.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 29.—Dichroscope (actual size).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 30.—Field of the Dichroscope.]\r\n\r\nFig. 29 illustrates in section the construction of a dichroscope. The\r\ninstrument consists essentially of a rhomb of Iceland-spar, _S_, of\r\nsuch a length as to give two contiguous images (Fig. 30) of a square\r\nhole, _H_, in one end of the tube containing it. In some instruments\r\nthe terminal faces of the rhomb are ground at right angles to its\r\nlength, but usually, as in that depicted, prisms of glass, _G_, are\r\ncemented on to the two ends. A cap _C_, with a slightly larger hole,\r\nwhich is circular in shape, fits on the end of the tube, and can be\r\nmoved up and down it and revolved round it, as desired. The stone, _R_,\r\nto be tested may be directly attached to it by means of some kind of\r\nwax or cement in such a way that light which has traversed it passes\r\ninto the window, _H_, of the instrument; the cap at the same time\r\npermits of the rotation of the stone about the axis of the main tube of\r\nthe instrument. The dichroscope shown in the figure has a still more\r\nconvenient arrangement: it is provided with an additional attachment,\r\n_A_, by means of which the stone can be turned about an axis at right\r\nangles to the length of the tube, and thus examined in different\r\ndirections. At the other end of the main tube is placed a lens, _L_, of\r\nlow power for viewing the twin images: the short tube containing it can\r\nbe pushed in and out for focusing purposes. Many makers now place the\r\nrhomb close to the lens, _L_, and thereby require a much smaller piece\r\nof spar; material suitable for optical purposes is fast growing scarce.\r\n\r\nSuppose that a plate of tourmaline cut parallel to its crystallographic\r\naxis is fastened to the cap and the latter rotated. We should notice,\r\non looking through the instrument, that in the course of a complete\r\nrevolution there are two positions, orientated at right angles to\r\none another, in which the tints of the two images are identical, the\r\npositions of greatest contrast of tint being midway between. If we\r\nexamine a uniaxial stone in a direction at right angles to its optic\r\naxis we obtain the colours corresponding to the ordinary and the\r\nextraordinary rays. In any direction less inclined to the axis we\r\nstill have the colour for the ordinary ray, but the other colour is\r\nintermediate in tint between it and that for the extraordinary ray.\r\nThe phenomenon presented by a biaxial stone is more complex. There\r\nare three principal colours which are visible in differing pairs in\r\nthe three principal optical directions; in other directions the tints\r\nseen are intermediate between the principal colours. Since biaxial\r\nstones have three principal colours, they are sometimes said to be\r\ntrichroic or pleochroic, but in any single direction they have two\r\ntwin colours and show dichroism. No difference at all will be shown in\r\ndirections in which a stone is singly refractive, and it is therefore\r\nalways advisable to examine a stone in more than one direction lest\r\nthe first happens to be one of single refraction. For determinative\r\npurposes it is not necessary to note the exact shades of tint of the\r\ntwin colours, because they vary with the inherent colour of the stone,\r\nand are therefore not constant for the same species; we need only\r\nobserve, when the stone is tested with the dichroscope, whether there\r\nis any variation of colour, and, if so, its strength. Dichroism is a\r\nresult of double refraction, and cannot exist in a singly refractive\r\nstone. The converse, however, is not true and it by no means follows\r\nthat, because no dichroism can be detected in a stone, it is singly\r\nrefractive. A colourless stone, for instance, cannot possibly be\r\ndichroic, and many coloured, doubly refractive stones—for example,\r\nzircon—exhibit no dichroism, or so little that it is imperceptible.\r\nThe character is always the better displayed, the deeper the inherent\r\ncolour of the stone. The deep-green alexandrite, for instance, is far\r\nmore dichroic than the lighter coloured varieties of chrysoberyl.\r\n\r\nIf the stone is attached to the cap of the instrument, the table should\r\nbe turned towards it so as to assure that the light passing into the\r\ninstrument has actually traversed the stone. If little light enters\r\nthrough the opposite coign, a drop of oil placed thereon will overcome\r\nthe difficulty (cf. p. 46). It is also necessary, for reasons mentioned\r\nabove, to examine the stone in directions as far as possible across\r\nthe girdle also. A convenient, though not strictly accurate, method\r\nis to lay the stone with the table facet on a table and examine the\r\nlight which has entered the stone and been reflected at that facet. The\r\nstone may easily be rotated on the table, and observations thus made\r\nin different directions in the stone. Care must be exercised in the\r\ncase of a faceted stone not to mistake the alteration in colour due to\r\ndispersion for a dichroic effect, and the stone must be placed close to\r\nthe instrument during an observation, because otherwise the twin rays\r\ntraversing the instrument may have taken sensibly different directions\r\nin the stone.\r\n\r\nDichroism is an effective test in the case of ruby; its twin\r\ncolours—purplish and yellowish red—are in marked contrast, and readily\r\ndistinguish it from other red stones. Again, one of the twin colours\r\nof sapphire is distinctly more yellowish than the other; the blue\r\nspinel, of which a good many have been manufactured during recent\r\nyears, is singly refractive, and, of course, shows no difference of\r\ntint in the dichroscope.\r\n\r\nTable VI at the end of the book gives the strength of the dichroism of\r\nthe gem-stones.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          ABSORPTION SPECTRA\r\n\r\nA study of the chromatic character of the light transmitted by a\r\ncoloured stone is of no little interest. As was stated above, the eye\r\nhas not the power of analysing light, and to resolve the transmitted\r\nrays into their component parts an instrument known as a spectroscope\r\nis needed. The small ‘direct-vision’ type has ample dispersion for this\r\npurpose. It is advantageous to employ by preference the diffraction\r\nrather than the prism form, because in the former the intervals in the\r\nresulting spectrum corresponding to equal differences of wave-length\r\nare the same, whereas in the latter they diminish as the wave-length\r\nincreases and accordingly the red end of the spectrum is relatively\r\ncramped.\r\n\r\nThe absorptive properties of all doubly refractive coloured substances\r\nvary more or less with the direction in which light traverses them\r\naccording to the amount of dichroism that they possess, but the\r\nvariation is not very noticeable unless the stone is highly dichroic.\r\nIf the light transmitted by a deep-coloured ruby be examined with a\r\nspectroscope it will be found that the whole of the green portion of\r\nthe spectrum is obliterated (Fig. 31), while in the case of a sapphire\r\nonly a small portion of the red end of the spectrum is absorbed.\r\nAlexandrite affords especial interest. In the spectrum of the light\r\ntransmitted by it, the violet and the yellow are more or less strongly\r\nabsorbed, depending upon the direction in which the rays have passed\r\nthrough the stone (Fig. 31), and the transmitted light is mainly\r\ncomposed of two portions—red and green. The apparent colour of the\r\nstone depends, therefore, upon which of the two predominates. In\r\ndaylight the resultant colour is green flecked with red and orange,\r\nthe three principal absorptive tints (cf. p. 235), but in artificial\r\nlight, which is relatively stronger in the red portion of the spectrum,\r\nthe resultant colour is a raspberry-red, and there is less apparent\r\ndifference in the absorptive tints (cf. Plate XXVII, Figs. 11, 13).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 31.—Absorption Spectra.]\r\n\r\nIn all the spectra just considered, and in all like them, the portions\r\nthat are absorbed are wide, the passage from blackness to colour is\r\ngradual, and the edges deliminating them are blurred. In the spectra of\r\ncertain zircons and in almandine garnet the absorbed portions, or bands\r\nas they are called, are narrow, and, moreover, the transition from\r\nblackness to colour is sharp and abrupt; such stones are therefore said\r\nto display absorption-bands. Church in 1866 was the first to notice\r\nthe bands shown by zircon (Fig. 31). Sorby thought they portended the\r\nexistence of a new element, to which he gave the name jargonium, but\r\nsubsequently discovered that they were caused by the presence of a\r\nminute trace of uranium. A yellowish-green zircon shows the phenomenon\r\nbest, and it has all the bands shown in the figure. The spectrum varies\r\nslightly but almost imperceptibly with the direction in the stone.\r\nOthers show the bands in the yellow and green, while others show only\r\nthose in the red, and some only one of them. The bands are not confined\r\nto stones of any particular colour, or amount of double refraction.\r\nAgain, many zircons show no bands at all, so that their absence by no\r\nmeans precludes the stone from being a zircon.\r\n\r\nAlmandine is characterized by a different spectrum (Fig. 31). The band\r\nin the yellow is the most conspicuous, and is no doubt responsible for\r\nthe purple hue of a typical almandine. The spectrum varies in strength\r\nin different stones. Rhodolite (p. 214), a garnet lying between\r\nalmandine and pyrope, displays the same bands, and indications of them\r\nmay be detected in the spectra of pyropes of high refraction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PLATE IV_\r\n\r\nJEWELLERY DESIGNS]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n                           SPECIFIC GRAVITY\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is one of our earliest experiences that different substances of\r\nthe same size have often markedly different weights; thus, there is\r\na great difference between wood and iron, and still greater between\r\nwood and lead. It is usual to say that iron is heavier than wood,\r\nbut the statement is misleading, because it would be possible by\r\nselecting a large enough piece of wood to find one at least as heavy\r\nas a particular piece of iron. We have, in fact, to compare equal\r\nvolumes of the two substances, and all ambiguity is removed if we\r\nspeak of relative density or specific gravity—the former term being\r\nusually applied to liquids and the latter to solids—instead of weight\r\nor heaviness. The density of water at 4° C. is taken as unity, that\r\nbeing the temperature at which it is highest; at other temperatures it\r\nis somewhat lower, as will be seen from Table IX given at the end of\r\nthe book. The direct determination of the volume of an irregular solid\r\npresents almost insuperable difficulty; but, fortunately, for finding\r\nthe specific gravity it is quite unnecessary to know the volume, as\r\nwill be shown when we proceed to consider the methods in use.\r\n\r\nThe specific gravity of a stone is a character which is within narrow\r\nlimits constant for each species, and is therefore very useful for\r\ndiscriminative purposes. It can be determined whatever be the shape\r\nof the stone, and it is immaterial whether it be transparent or not;\r\nbut, on the other hand, the stone must be unmounted and free from the\r\nsetting.\r\n\r\nThe methods for the determination of the specific gravity are of two\r\nkinds: in the first a liquid is found of the same, or nearly the same,\r\ndensity as the stone, and in the second weighings are made and the use\r\nof an accurate balance is required.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           (1) HEAVY LIQUIDS\r\n\r\nExperiment tells us that a solid substance floats in a liquid denser\r\nthan itself, sinks in one less dense, and remains suspended at any\r\nlevel in one of precisely the same density. If the stone be only\r\nslightly less dense than the liquid, it will rise to the surface; if\r\nit be just as slightly denser, it will as surely sink to the bottom,\r\na physical fact which has added so much to the difficulty and danger\r\nof submarine manœuvring. If then we can find a liquid denser than the\r\nstone to be tested, and place the latter in it, the stone will float on\r\nthe surface. If we take a liquid which is less dense than the stone and\r\ncapable of mixing with the heavier liquid, and add it to the latter,\r\ndrop by drop, gently stirring so as to assure that the density of\r\nthe combination is uniformly the same throughout, a stage is finally\r\nreached when the stone begins to move downwards. It has now very nearly\r\nthe density of the liquid, and, if we find by some means this density,\r\nwe know simultaneously the specific gravity of the stone.\r\n\r\nVarious devices and methods are available for ascertaining the density\r\nof liquids—for instance, Westphal’s balance; but, apart from the\r\ninconvenience attending such a determination, the density of all\r\nliquids is somewhat seriously affected by changes in the temperature,\r\nand it is therefore better to make direct comparison with fragments\r\nof substances of known specific gravity, which are termed indicators.\r\nIf of two fragments differing slightly in specific gravity one floats\r\non the surface of a uniform column of liquid and the other lies at\r\nthe bottom of the tube containing the liquid, we may be certain that\r\nthe density of the liquid is intermediate between the two specific\r\ngravities. Such a precaution is necessary because, if the liquid be a\r\nmixture of two distinct liquids, the density would tend to increase\r\nowing to the greater volatility of the lighter of them, and in any case\r\nthe density is affected by change of temperature. The specific gravity\r\nof stones is not much altered by variation in the temperature.\r\n\r\nA more convenient variation of this method is to form a diffusion\r\ncolumn, so that the density increases progressively with the depth.\r\nIf the stone under test floats at a certain level in such a column\r\nintermediate between two fragments of known specific gravity, its\r\nspecific gravity may be found by elementary interpolation. To form a\r\ncolumn of this kind the lighter liquid should be poured on to the top\r\nof the heavier. Natural diffusion gives the most perfect column, but,\r\nbeing a lengthy process, it may conveniently be quickened by gently\r\nshaking the tube, and the column thus formed gives results sufficiently\r\naccurate for discriminative purposes.\r\n\r\nBy far the most convenient liquid for ordinary use is methylene\r\niodide, which has already been recommended for its high refraction.\r\nIt has, when pure, a density at ordinary room-temperatures of 3·324,\r\nand it is miscible in all proportions with benzol, whose density is\r\nO·88, or toluol, another hydrocarbon which is somewhat less volatile\r\nthan benzol, and whose density is about the same, namely, 0·86. When\r\nfresh, methylene iodide has only a slight tinge of yellow, but it\r\nrapidly darkens on exposure to light owing to the liberation of iodine\r\nwhich is in a colloidal form and cannot be removed by filtration.\r\nThe liquid may, however, be easily cleared by shaking it up with any\r\nsubstance with which the iodine combines to form an iodide removable\r\nby filtration. Copper filings answer the purpose well, though rather\r\nslow in action; mercury may also be used, but is not very satisfactory,\r\nbecause a small amount may be dissolved and afterwards be precipitated\r\non to the stone under test, carrying it down to the bottom of the tube.\r\nCaustic potash (potassium hydroxide) is also recommended; in this case\r\nthe operation should preferably be carried out in a special apparatus\r\nwhich permits the clear liquid to be drawn off underneath, because\r\nwater separates out and floats on the surface. In Fig. 32 three cut\r\nstones, a quartz (_a_), a beryl (_b_), and a tourmaline (_c_) are shown\r\nfloating in a diffusion column of methylene iodide and benzol. Although\r\nthe beryl is only slightly denser than the quartz, it floats at a\r\nperceptibly lower level. These three species are occasionally found as\r\nyellow stones of very similar tint.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 32.—Stones of different Specific Gravities floating\r\nin a Diffusion Column of heavy Liquid.]\r\n\r\nVarious other liquids have been used or proposed for the same\r\npurpose, of which two may be mentioned. The first of them is a\r\nsaturated solution of potassium iodide and mercuric iodide in water,\r\nwhich is known after the discoverer as Sonstadt’s solution. It is a\r\nclear mobile liquid with an amber colour, having at 12° C. a density\r\nof 3·085; it may be mixed with water to any extent, and is easily\r\nconcentrated by heating; moreover, it is durable and not subject to\r\nalteration of any kind; on the other hand, it is highly poisonous and\r\ncauterizes the skin, not being checked by albumen; it also destroys\r\nbrass-ware by amalgamating the metal. The second is Klein’s solution,\r\na clear yellow liquid which has at 15° C. a density of 3·28. It\r\nconsists of the boro-tungstate of cadmium, of which the formula is\r\n9WO_{3}.B_{2}O_{3}.2CdO.2H_{2}O + 16Aq, dissolved in water, with which\r\nit may be diluted. If the salt be heated, it fuses at 75° C. in its\r\nown water of crystallization to a yellow liquid, very mobile, with a\r\ndensity of 3·55. Klein’s solution is harmless, but it cannot compare\r\nfor convenience of manipulation with methylene iodide.\r\n\r\nThe most convenient procedure is to have at hand three glass tubes,\r\nfitted with stoppers or corks, to contain liquids of different\r\ndensities—\r\n\r\n(_a_) Methylene iodide reduced to 2·7; using as indicators orthoclase\r\n2·55, quartz 2·66, and beryl 2·74.\r\n\r\n(_b_) Methylene iodide reduced to 3·1; indicators, beryl 2·74 and\r\ntourmaline 3·10.\r\n\r\n(_c_) Methylene iodide, undiluted, 3·32.\r\n\r\nThe pure liquid in the last tube should on no account be diluted; but\r\nthe density of the other two liquids may be varied slightly, either\r\nby adding benzol in order to lower it, or by allowing benzol, which\r\nhas far greater volatility than methylene iodide, to evaporate, or by\r\nadding methylene iodide, in order to increase it. The density of the\r\nliquids may be ascertained approximately from the indicators.\r\n\r\nA glance at the table of specific gravities shows that as regards the\r\ngem-stones methylene iodide is restricted in its application, since\r\nit can be used to test only moonstone, quartz, beryl, tourmaline, and\r\nspodumene; opal and turquoise, being amorphous and more or less porous,\r\nshould not be immersed in liquids, lest the appearance of the stone be\r\nirretrievably injured. Methylene iodide readily serves to distinguish\r\nthe yellow quartz from the true topaz, with which jewellers often\r\nconfuse it, the latter stone sinking in the liquid; again aquamarine\r\nfloats, but the blue topaz, which is often very similar to it, sinks in\r\nmethylene iodide.\r\n\r\nBy saturating methylene iodide with iodine and iodoform, we have a\r\nliquid (_d_) of density 3·6; a fragment of topaz, 3·55, may be used to\r\nindicate whether the liquid has the requisite density. Unfortunately\r\nthis saturated solution is so dark as to be almost opaque, and is,\r\nmoreover, very viscous. Its principal use is to distinguish diamond,\r\n3·535, from the brilliant colourless zircon, with which, apart from\r\na test for hardness, it may easily be confused. It is easy to see\r\nwhether the stone floats, as it would do if a diamond. To recover a\r\nstone which has sunk, the only course is to pour off the liquid into\r\nanother tube, because it is far too dark for the position of the stone\r\nto be seen.\r\n\r\nIt is possible to employ a similar method for still denser stones by\r\nhaving recourse to Retgers’s salt, silver-thallium nitrate. This double\r\nsalt is solid at ordinary room-temperatures, but has the remarkable\r\nproperty of melting at a temperature, 75° C., which is well below the\r\npoint of fusion of either of its constituents, to a clear, mobile\r\nyellow liquid, which is miscible in any proportion with water, and\r\nhas, when pure, a density of 4·6. The salt may be purchased, or it may\r\nbe prepared by mixing 100 grams of thallium nitrate and 64 grams of\r\nsilver nitrate, or similar proportions, in a little water, and heating\r\nthe whole over a water-bath, keeping it constantly stirred with a\r\nglass rod until it is liquefied. The two salts must be mixed in the\r\ncorrect proportions, because otherwise the mixture might form other\r\ndouble salts, which do not melt at so low a temperature. A glance at\r\nthe table of specific gravities shows that Retgers’s salt may be used\r\nfor all the gem-stones with the single exception of zircon (b). There\r\nare, however, some objections to its use. It is expensive, and, unless\r\nkept constantly melted, it is not immediately available. It darkens on\r\nexposure to strong sunlight like all silver salts, stains the skin a\r\npeculiar shade of purple which is with difficulty removed, and in fact\r\nonly by abrasion of the skin, and, like all thallium compounds, is\r\nhighly poisonous.\r\n\r\nIt is convenient to have three tubes, fitted as before with stoppers\r\nor corks, to contain the following liquids, when heated:—\r\n\r\n(_e_) Silver-thallium nitrate, reduced to 3·5; using as indicators,\r\nperidot or idocrase 3·40 and topaz 3·53.\r\n\r\n(_f_) Silver-thallium nitrate, reduced to 4·0; indicators, topaz 3·53\r\nand sapphire 4·03.\r\n\r\n(_g_) Silver-thallium nitrate, undiluted, 4·6.\r\n\r\nThe tubes must be heated in some form of water-bath; an ordinary glass\r\nbeaker serves the purpose satisfactorily. The pure salt should never be\r\ndiluted; but the density of the contents of tubes (_e_) and (_f_) may\r\nbe varied at will, water being added in order to lower the density, and\r\nconcentration by means of evaporation or addition of the nitrate being\r\nemployed in order to increase it. To avoid the discoloration of the\r\nskin, rubber finger-stalls may be used, and the stones should not be\r\nhandled until after they have been washed in warm water. The staining\r\nmay be minimized if the hands be well washed in hot water before being\r\nexposed to sunlight. It is advisable to warm the stone to be tested\r\nin a tube containing water beforehand lest the sudden heating develop\r\ncracks. A piece of platinum, or, failing that, copper wire is of\r\nservice for removing stones from the tubes; a glass rod, spoon-shaped\r\nat one end, does equally well. It must be noted that although Retgers’s\r\nsalt is absolutely harmless to the ordinary gem-stones—with the\r\nexception of opal and turquoise, which, as has already been stated,\r\nbeing to some extent porous, should not be immersed in liquids—it\r\nattacks certain substances, for instance, sulphides and cannot be\r\napplied indiscriminately to minerals.\r\n\r\nThe procedure described above is intended only as a suggestion;\r\nthe method may be varied to any extent at will, depending upon the\r\nparticular requirements. If such tests are made only occasionally, a\r\nsmaller number of tubes may be used. Thus one tube may be substituted\r\nfor the two marked _a_ and _b_, the liquid contained in it being\r\ndiluted as required, and a series of indicators may be kept apart in\r\nsmall glass tubes. On the other hand, any one having constantly to test\r\nstones might increase the number of tubes with advantage, and might\r\nfind it useful to have at hand fragments of all the principal species\r\nin order to make direct comparison.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          (2) DIRECT WEIGHING\r\n\r\nThe balance which is necessary in both the methods described under this\r\nhead should be capable of giving results accurate to milligrams, _i.e._\r\nthe thousandth part of a gram, and consistent with that restriction\r\nthe beam may be as short as possible so as to give rapid swings and\r\nthus shorten the time taken in the observations. A good assay balance\r\nanswers the purpose admirably. Of course, it is never necessary to wait\r\ntill the balance has come to rest. The mean of the extreme readings of\r\nthe pointer attached to the beam will give the position in which it\r\nwould ultimately come to rest. Thus, if the pointer just touches the\r\neighth division on the right-hand side and the second on the other,\r\nthe mean position is the third division on the right-hand side (½(8 −\r\n2) = 3). Instead of the ordinary form of chemical balance, Westphal’s\r\nform or Joly’s spring-balance may be employed. Weighings are made more\r\nquickly, but are not so accurate.\r\n\r\nIn refined physical work the practice known as double-weighing is\r\nemployed to obviate any slight error there may be in the suspension\r\nof the balance. A counterpoise which is heavier than anything to be\r\nweighed is placed in one pan, and weighed. The counterpoise is retained\r\nin its pan throughout the whole course of the weighings. Any substance\r\nwhose weight is to be found is placed in the other pan, and weights\r\nadded till the balance swings truly again. The difference between\r\nthe two sets of weights evidently gives the weight of the substance.\r\nBalances, however, are so accurately constructed that for testing\r\npurposes such refined precautions are not really necessary.\r\n\r\nIt is immaterial in what notation the weighings are made, so long as\r\nthe same is used throughout, but the metric system of weights, which\r\nis in universal use in scientific work, should preferably be employed.\r\nJewellers, however, use carat weights, and a subdivision to the base\r\n2 instead of decimals, the fractions being ½, ¼, ⅛, 1/16, 1/32, 1/64.\r\nIf these weights be employed, it will be necessary to convert these\r\nfractions into decimals, and write ½ = ·500, ¼ ·250, ⅛ = ·125, 1/16 =\r\n·062, 1/32 = ·031, 1/64 = ·016.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      (a) _Hydrostatic Weighing_\r\n\r\nThe principle of this method is very simple. The stone, the specific\r\ngravity of which is required, is first weighed in air and then when\r\nimmersed in water. If _W_ and _W´_ be these weights respectively, then\r\n_W_ − _W´_ is evidently the weight of the water displaced by the stone\r\nand having therefore the same volume as it, and the specific gravity is\r\n                      _W_\r\ntherefore equal to ———————————.\r\n                   _W_ − _W^r_\r\n\r\nIf the method of double-weighing had been adopted, the formula would\r\nbe slightly altered. Thus, suppose that _c_ corresponds to the\r\ncounterpoise, _w_ and _w´_ to the stone weighed in air and water\r\nrespectively; then we have _W_ = _c_ − _w_ and _W´_ = _c_ − _w´_, and\r\n                                           _c_ − _w_\r\ntherefore the specific gravity is equal to ——————————.\r\n                                           _w´_ − _w_\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 33.—Hydrostatic Balance.]\r\n\r\nSome precautions are necessary in practice to assure an accurate\r\nresult. A balance intended for specific gravity work is provided with\r\nan auxiliary pan (Fig. 33), which hangs high enough up to permit of\r\nthe stone being suspended underneath. The weight of anything used for\r\nthe suspension must, of course, be determined and subtracted from the\r\nweight found for the stone, both when in air and when in water. A piece\r\nof fine silk is generally used for suspending the stone in water,\r\nbut it should be avoided, because the water tends to creep up it and\r\nthe error thus introduced affects the first place of decimals in the\r\ncase of a one-carat stone, the value being too high. A piece of brass\r\nwire shaped into a cage is much to be preferred. If the same cage be\r\nhabitually used, its weight in air and when immersed in water to the\r\ncustomary extent in such determinations should be found once for all.\r\n\r\nCare must also be taken to remove all air-bubbles which cling to the\r\nstone or the cage; their presence would tend to make the value too low.\r\nThe surface tension of water which makes it cling to the wire prevents\r\nthe balance swinging freely, and renders it difficult to obtain a\r\nweighing correct to a milligram when the wire dips into water. This\r\ndifficulty may be overcome by substituting a liquid such as toluol,\r\nwhich has a much smaller surface tension.\r\n\r\nAs has been stated above, the density of water at 4° C. is taken as\r\nunity, and it is therefore necessary to multiply the values obtained\r\nby the density of the liquid, whatever it be, at the temperature of\r\nthe observation. In Table IX, at the end of the book, are given the\r\ndensities of water and toluol at ordinary room-temperatures. It will be\r\nnoticed that a correct reading of the temperature is far more important\r\nin the case of toluol.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Example of a Hydrostatic Determination of Specific Gravity—_\r\n\r\n  Weight of stone in air   = 1·471 gram\r\n  Weight of stone in water = 1·067  „\r\n                                 1·471       1·471\r\n  Specific gravity         = ————————————— = —————\r\n                             1·471 − 1·067   0·404.\r\n\r\nAllowing for the density of water at the temperature of the room, which\r\nwas 16° C., the specific gravity is 3·637. Had no such allowance been\r\nmade, the result would have been four units too high in the third place\r\nof decimals. For discriminative purposes, however, such refinement is\r\nunnecessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n             (b) _Pycnometer, or Specific Gravity Bottle_\r\n\r\nThe specific gravity bottle is merely one with a fairly long neck on\r\nwhich a horizontal mark has been scratched, and which is closed by\r\na ground glass stopper. The pycnometer is a refined variety of the\r\nspecific gravity bottle. It has two openings: the larger is intended\r\nfor the insertion of the stone and the water, and is closed by a\r\nstopper through which a thermometer passes, while the other, which is\r\nexceedingly narrow, is closed by a stopper fitting on the outside, and\r\nis graduated to facilitate the determination of the height of the water\r\nin it.\r\n\r\nThe stone is weighed as in the previous method. The bottle is then\r\nweighed, and filled with water up to the mark and weighed again. The\r\nstone is now introduced into the bottle, and the surplus water removed\r\nwith blotting-paper or otherwise until it is at the same level as\r\nbefore, and the bottle with its contents is weighed. Let _W_ be the\r\nweight of the stone, _w_ the weight of the bottle, _W_´ the weight of\r\nthe bottle and the water contained in it, and _W_″ the weight of the\r\nbottle when containing the stone and the water. Then _W_´ − _w_ is the\r\nweight of the water filling the bottle up to the mark, and\r\n_W_″ − _w_ − _W_ is the reduced weight of water after the stone has\r\nbeen inserted; the difference, _W_ + _W_´ − _W_″, is the weight of the\r\n                                                         _W_\r\nwater displaced. The specific gravity is therefore ——————————————————.\r\n                                                   _W_ + _W_´ − _W_″\r\nAs in the previous method, this value must be multiplied by the density\r\nof the liquid at the temperature of the experiment. If the method of\r\ndouble-weighing be adopted, the formula will be slightly modified.\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n\r\nOf the above methods, that of heavy liquids, as it is usually termed,\r\nis by far the quickest and the most convenient for stones of ordinary\r\nsize, the specific gravity of which is less than the density of pure\r\nmethylene iodide, namely, 3·324, and by its aid a value may be obtained\r\nwhich is accurate to the second place of decimals, a result quite\r\nsufficient for a discriminative test. The method is applicable no\r\nmatter how small the stone may be, and, indeed, for very small stones\r\nit is the only trustworthy method; for large stones it is inconvenient,\r\nnot only because of the large quantity of liquid required, but also\r\non account of the difficulty in estimating with sufficient certainty\r\nthe position of the centre of gravity of the stone. A negative\r\ndetermination may be of value, especially if attention be paid to the\r\nrate at which the stone falls through the liquid; the denser the stone\r\nthe faster it will sink, but the rate depends also upon the shape of\r\nthe stone. Retgers’s salt is less convenient because of the delay\r\ninvolved in warming it and of the almost inevitable staining of the\r\nhands, but its use presents no difficulty whatever.\r\n\r\nHydrostatic weighing is always available, unless the stone be very\r\nsmall, but the necessary weighings occupy considerable time, and care\r\nmust be taken that no error creeps into the computation, simple though\r\nit be. Even if everything is at hand, a determination is scarcely\r\npossible under a quarter of an hour.\r\n\r\nThe third method, which takes even longer, is intended primarily for\r\npowdered substances, and is not recommended for cut stones, unless\r\nthere happen to be a number of tiny ones which are known to be exactly\r\nof the same kind.\r\n\r\nThe specific gravities of the gem-stones are given in Table VII at the\r\nend of the book.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n                       HARDNESS AND CLEAVABILITY\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery possessor of a diamond ring is aware that diamond easily\r\nscratches window-glass. If other stones were tried, it would be\r\nfound that they also scratched glass, but not so readily, and, if\r\nthe experiment were extended, it would be found that topaz scratches\r\nquartz, but is scratched by corundum, which in its turn yields to\r\nthe all-powerful diamond. There is therefore considerable variation\r\nin the capacity of precious stones to resist abrasion, or, as it is\r\nusually termed, in their hardness. To simplify the mode of expressing\r\nthis character the mineralogist Mohs about a century ago devised the\r\nfollowing arbitrary scale, which is still in general use.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       MOHS’S SCALE OF HARDNESS\r\n\r\n                           1. Talc\r\n                           2. Gypsum\r\n                           3. Calcite\r\n                           4. Fluor\r\n                           5. Apatite\r\n                           6. Orthoclase\r\n                           7. Quartz\r\n                           8. Topaz\r\n                           9. Corundum\r\n                          10. Diamond\r\n\r\nA finger-nail scratches gypsum and softer substances. Ordinary\r\nwindow-glass is slightly softer than orthoclase, and a steel knife is\r\nslightly harder; a hardened file approaches quartz in hardness, and\r\neasily scratches glass.\r\n\r\nBy saying that a stone has hardness 7 we merely mean that it will not\r\nscratch quartz, and quartz will not scratch it. The numbers indicate\r\nan order, and have no quantitative significance whatever. This is an\r\nimportant point about which mistakes are often made. We must not, for\r\ninstance, suppose that diamond has twice the hardness of apatite.\r\nAs a matter of fact, the interval between diamond and corundum is\r\nimmensely greater than that between the latter and talc, the softest\r\nof mineral substances. Intermediate degrees of hardness are expressed\r\nby fractions. The number 8½ for chrysoberyl means that it scratches\r\ntopaz as easily as it itself is scratched by corundum. Pyrope garnet is\r\nslightly harder than quartz, and its hardness is said therefore to be\r\n7¼.\r\n\r\nDelicate tests show that the structure of all crystallized substances\r\nis more or less grained, like that of wood, and the hardness for the\r\nsame stone varies in different directions. Kyanite is unique in this\r\nrespect, since its hardness ranges from 5 to 7; it can therefore\r\nbe scratched by a knife in some directions, but not in others. In\r\nmost substances, however, the range is so small as to be quite\r\nimperceptible. Slight variation is also apparent in the hardness of\r\ndifferent specimens of the same species. The diamonds from Borneo and\r\nNew South Wales are so distinctly harder than those from South Africa\r\nand other localities that, when first discovered, some difficulty was\r\nexperienced in cutting them. Again, lapidaries find that while Ceylon\r\nsapphires are harder than rubies, Kashmir sapphires are softer.\r\n\r\nHardness is a character of fundamental importance in a stone intended\r\nfor ornamental wear, since upon it depends the durability of the polish\r\nand brilliancy. Ordinary dust is largely composed of grains of sand,\r\nwhich is quartz in a minute form, and a gem-stone should therefore\r\nbe at least as hard as that. Paste imitations are little harder than\r\n5, and consequently, as experience shows, their polish does not\r\nsurvive a few weeks’ wear. Hardness is, however, of little use as a\r\ndiscriminative test except for distinguishing between topaz or harder\r\nstone and paste. Diamond is so much harder than other stones that it\r\nwill leave a cut in glass quite different from the scratch of even\r\ncorundum. Paste, being so soft, readily yields to the file, and is thus\r\neasily distinguished from genuine stones. In applying the test to a\r\ncut stone, it is best to remove it from its mount and try the effect\r\non the girdle, because any scratch would be concealed afterwards by\r\nthe setting. Any mark should be rubbed with the finger to assure that\r\nit is not due to powder from the scratching agent; confusion may often\r\nbe caused in this way when the two substances are of nearly the same\r\nhardness.\r\n\r\nThe degrees of hardness of the gem-stones are given in Table VIII at\r\nthe end of the book.\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n\r\nIt must not be overlooked that extreme hardness is compatible with\r\ncleavability in certain directions intimately connected with the\r\ncrystalline structure; the property, in fact, characterizes many\r\nmineral species of different degrees of hardness. Diamond can be split\r\nin four directions parallel to the faces of the regular octahedron,\r\na property utilized by the lapidary for shaping a stone previous to\r\ncutting it. Topaz cleaves with considerable ease at right angles to the\r\nprincipal crystallographic axis. Felspar has two directions of cleavage\r\nnearly at right angles to one another. The new gem-stone, kunzite,\r\nneeds cautious handling owing to the facility with which it splits in\r\ntwo directions mutually inclined at about 70°.\r\n\r\nAll stones are more or less brittle, and will be fractured by a\r\nsufficiently violent blow, but the irregular surface of a fracture\r\ncannot be mistaken for the brilliant flat surface given by a cleavage.\r\nThe cleavage is by no means induced with equal facility in the species\r\nmentioned above. A considerable effort is required to split diamond,\r\nbut in the case of topaz or kunzite incipient cleavage in the shape of\r\nflaws may be started if the stone be merely dropped on to a hard floor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER X\r\n\r\n                         ELECTRICAL CHARACTERS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe definite orientation of the molecular arrangement of crystallized\r\nsubstances leads in many cases to attributes which vary with the\r\ndirection and are revealed by the electrical properties. If a\r\ntourmaline crystal be heated in a gas or alcohol flame it becomes\r\ncharged with electricity, and, since it is at the same time a bad\r\nconductor, static charges of opposite sign appear at the two ends.\r\nTopaz shows similar characters, but in a lesser degree. Quartz, if\r\ntreated in the same way, shows charges of opposite sign on different\r\nsides, but the phenomenon may be masked by intimate twinning and\r\nconsequent overlapping of the contrary areas. The phenomenon may\r\nalso be seen when the stones are cut. The most convenient method for\r\ndetecting the existence of the electrical charges is that devised\r\nby Kundt. A powder consisting of a mixture of red lead and sulphur\r\nis placed in a bellows arrangement and blown through a sieve at one\r\nend on to the stone. Owing to the friction the particles become\r\nelectrified—red lead positively and sulphur negatively—and are\r\nattracted by the charges of opposing sign, which will therefore be\r\nbetrayed by the colour of the dust at the corresponding spot. The\r\npowder must be kept dry; otherwise a chemical reaction may occur\r\nleading to the formation of lead sulphide, recognizable by its black\r\ncolour. Bücker has suggested as an alternative the use of sulphur,\r\ncoloured red with carmine, the negative element, and yellow lycopodium,\r\nthe positive element.\r\n\r\nDiamond, topaz, and tourmaline are powerful enough, when electrified\r\nby friction with a cloth, to attract fragments of paper, the\r\nelectrification being positive. Amber develops considerable negative\r\nelectricity when treated in a similar manner.\r\n\r\nDiamond is translucent to the Röntgen (X) rays; glass, on the other\r\nhand, is opaque to them, and this test distinguishes brilliants from\r\npaste imitations. Diamond also, unlike glass, phosphoresces under the\r\ninfluence of radium, a property characterizing also kunzite.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the electrical characters, although of\r\nconsiderable interest to the student, are, on account of their\r\nlimited application and difficulty of test, of little service for the\r\ndiscrimination of gem-stones.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           PART I—SECTION B\r\n\r\n                     THE TECHNOLOGY OF GEM-STONES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n                            UNIT OF WEIGHT\r\n\r\n\r\nThe system in use for recording the weights of precious stones is\r\npeculiar to jewellery. The unit, which is known as the carat, bears no\r\nsimple relation to any unit that has existed among European nations,\r\nand indubitably has been introduced from the East. When man in early\r\ndays sought to record the weights of small objects, he made use of the\r\nmost convenient seeds or grains which were easily obtainable and were\r\nat the same time nearly uniform in size. In Europe the smallest unit of\r\nweight was the barley grain. Similarly in the East the seeds of some\r\nleguminous tree were selected. Those of the locust-tree, _Ceratonia\r\nsiliqua_, which is common in the countries bordering the Mediterranean,\r\non the average weigh so nearly a carat that they almost certainly\r\nformed the original unit. It is, indeed, from the Greek κεράτιον,\r\nlittle horn, which refers to the shape of the pods, that the word carat\r\nis derived.\r\n\r\nIt is one of the eccentricities of the jewellery trade that precision\r\nshould not have been given to the unit of weight. Not only does it\r\nvary at most of the trade centres in the world, but it is not even\r\nalways constant at each centre. The difference is negligible in the\r\ncase of single stones of ordinary size, but becomes a matter of serious\r\nimportance when large stones, or parcels of small stones, are bought\r\nand sold, particularly when the stones are very costly. Attempts have\r\nbeen made at various times to secure a uniform standard, but as yet\r\nwith only partial success. In 1871 the carat defined as the equivalent\r\nof 0·20500 gram was suggested at a meeting of the principal jewellers\r\nof Paris and London, and was eventually accepted in Paris, New York,\r\nLeipzig, and Borneo. It has, however, recently been recognized that\r\nin view of the gradual spread of the metric system of weights and\r\nmeasures the most satisfactory unit is the metric carat of one-fifth\r\n(0·2) gram. This has now been constituted the legal carat of France\r\nand Belgium, and no doubt other countries will follow their example.\r\nThe carat weight obtaining in London weighs about 0·20530 gram, and\r\nthe approximate equivalents in the gram at other centres are as\r\nfollows:—Florence 0·19720, Madrid 0·20539, Berlin 0·20544, Amsterdam\r\n0·20570, Lisbon 0·20575, Frankfort-on-Main 0·20577, Vienna 0·20613,\r\nVenice 0·20700, and Madras 0·20735. The gram itself is inconveniently\r\nlarge to serve as a unit for the generality of stones met with in\r\nordinary jewellery.\r\n\r\nThe notation for expressing the sub-multiples of the carat forms\r\nanother curious eccentricity. Fractions are used which are powers of\r\nthe half: thus the half, the half of that, _i.e._ the quarter, and so\r\non down to the sixty-fourth, and the weight of a stone is expressed\r\nby a series of fractions, _e.g._ 3½ ⅛ 1/64 carats. In the case of\r\ndiamond a single unreduced fraction to the base 64 is substituted in\r\nplace of the series of single fractions, and the weight of a stone is\r\nstated thus, 4-40/64 carats. With the introduction of the metric\r\ncarat the more convenient and rational decimal notation would, of\r\ncourse, be simultaneously adopted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figs. 34-39.—Exact Sizes of Brilliants of various\r\nWeights.]\r\n\r\nFigs. 34-39 illustrate the exact sizes of diamonds of certain weights,\r\nwhen cut as brilliants. The sizes of other stones depends upon their\r\nspecific gravity, the weight varying as the volume multiplied by the\r\nspecific gravity. Quartz, for instance, has a low specific gravity and\r\nwould be perceptibly larger, weight for weight; zircon, on the other\r\nhand, would be smaller.\r\n\r\nIt has been found more convenient to select a smaller unit in the case\r\nof pearls, namely, the pearl-grain, four of which go to the carat.\r\n\r\nStencil gauges are in use for measuring approximately the weight in\r\ncarats of diamond brilliants and of pearls, which in both instances\r\nmust be unmounted. A more accurate method for determining the weight\r\nof diamonds has been devised by Charles Moe, which is applicable to\r\neither unmounted or mounted stones. By means of callipers, which read\r\nto three-tenths of a millimetre, the diameter and the depth of the\r\nstone are measured, and by reference to a table the corresponding\r\nweight is found; allowance is made for the varying fineness of the\r\ngirdle, and, in the case of large stones, for the variation from a\r\nstrictly circular section.\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n\r\nSince this chapter was written the movement in favour of the metric\r\ncarat has made rapid progress, and this unit will soon have been\r\nadopted as the legal standard all over the world, even in countries,\r\nsuch as the British Isles and the United States, where the metric\r\nsystem is not in use. The advantage of an international unit is too\r\nobvious to need arguing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n                       FASHIONING OF GEM-STONES\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough many of the gem-stones have been endowed by nature with\r\nbrilliant lustrous faces and display scintillating reflections from\r\ntheir surfaces, yet their form is never such as to reveal to full\r\nperfection the optical qualities upon which their charm depends.\r\nMoreover, the natural faces are seldom perfect; as a rule the stones\r\nare broken either through some convulsion of the earth’s crust or in\r\ncourse of extraction from the matrix in which they have lain, or they\r\nare roughened by attrition against matter of greater hardness, or worn\r\nby the prolonged action of water, or etched by solvents. Beautiful\r\noctahedra of diamond or spinel have been mounted without further\r\nembellishment, but even their appearance might have been much improved\r\nat the lapidary’s hands.\r\n\r\nBy far the oldest of the existing styles of cutting is the rounded\r\nshape known as cabochon, a French word derived from the Latin _cabo_,\r\na head. In the days of the Roman Empire the softer stones were often\r\ntreated in this manner; such stones were supposed to be beneficial\r\nto those suffering from short-sightedness, the reason no doubt being\r\nthat transparent stones when cut as a double cabochon formed a convex\r\nlens. According to Pliny, Nero had an emerald thus cut, through\r\nwhich he was accustomed to view the gladiatorial shows. This style of\r\ncutting was long a favourite for coloured stones, such as emerald,\r\nruby, sapphire, and garnet, but has been abandoned in modern practice\r\nexcept for opaque, semi-opaque, and imperfect stones. The crimson\r\ngarnet, which was at one time known by the name carbuncle, was so\r\nsystematically thus cut that the word has come to signify a red garnet\r\nof this form. It was a popular brooch-stone with our grandmothers, but\r\nis no longer in vogue. The East still retains a taste for stones cut\r\nin the form of beads and drilled through the centre; the beads are\r\nthreaded together, and worn as necklaces. The native lapidaries often\r\nimprove the colour of pale emeralds by lining the hole with green paint.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PLATE V_\r\n\r\nJEWELLERY DESIGNS]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 40.—Double (Convex) Cabochon.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 41.—Simple Cabochon.]\r\n\r\nThe cabochon form may be of three different kinds. In the first, the\r\ndouble cabochon (Fig. 40), both the upper and the under sides of the\r\nstones are curved. The curvature, however, need not be the same in\r\neach case; indeed, it is usually markedly different. Moonstones and\r\nstarstones are generally cut very steep above and shallow underneath.\r\nOccasionally a ruby or a sapphire is, when cut in this way, set with\r\nthe shallow side above, because the light that has penetrated into the\r\nstone from above is more wholly reflected from a steep surface with\r\nconsequent increase in the glow of colour from the stone. Opals are\r\nalways cut higher on the exposed side, but the slope of the surface\r\nvaries considerably; they are generally cut steeply when required for\r\nmounting in rings. Chrysoberyl cat’s-eyes are invariably cut with\r\ncurved bases in order to preserve the weight as great as possible.\r\nThe double cabochon form with a shallow surface underneath merges\r\ninto the second kind (Fig. 41) in which the under side is plane, the\r\nform commonly employed for quartz cat’s-eyes, and occasionally also\r\nfor carbuncles. In this type the plane side is invariably mounted\r\ndownwards. In the third form (Fig. 42) the curvature of the under\r\nsurface is reversed, and the stone is hollowed out into a concave\r\nshape. This style is reserved for dark stones, such as carbuncles,\r\nwhich, if cut at all thick, would show very little colour. A piece of\r\nfoil is often placed in the hollow in order to increase the reflection\r\nof light, and thus to heighten the colour effect.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 42.—Double (Concavo-convex) Cabochon.]\r\n\r\nIn early days it was supposed that the extreme hardness of diamond\r\nprecluded the possibility of fashioning it, and up to the fifteenth\r\ncentury all that was done was to remove the gum-like skin which\r\ndisfigured the Indian stones and to polish the natural facets.\r\nThe first notable advance was made in 1475, when Louis de Berquem\r\ndiscovered, as it is said quite by accident, that two diamonds if\r\nrubbed together ground each other. With confident courage he essayed\r\nthe new art upon three large stones entrusted to him by Charles the\r\nBold, to the entire satisfaction of his patron. The use of wheels\r\nor discs charged with diamond dust soon followed, but at first the\r\nlapidaries evinced their victory over such stubborn material by\r\ngrinding diamond into divers fantastic shapes, and failed to realize\r\nhow much might be done to enhance the intrinsic beauty of the stones by\r\nthe means now at their disposal. The Indian lapidaries arrived at the\r\nsame discovery independently, and Tavernier found, when visiting the\r\ncountry in 1665, a large number of diamond cutters actively employed.\r\nIf the stone were perfectly clear, they contented themselves with\r\npolishing the natural facets; but if it contained flaws or specks, they\r\ncovered it with numerous small facets haphazardly placed. The stone was\r\ninvariably left in almost its original shape, and no effort was made to\r\nimprove the symmetry.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 43.—Table Cut (top view).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 44.—Table Cut (side view).]\r\n\r\nFor a long time little further progress was made, and even nearly a\r\ncentury after Berquem the only regular patterns known to Kentmann, who\r\nwrote in 1562, were the diamond-point and the diamond-table (Figs.\r\n43-44). The former consisted of the natural octahedron facets ground\r\nto regular shape, and was long employed for the minute stones which\r\nwere set in conjunction with large coloured stones in rings. The table\r\nrepresented considerably greater labour. One corner of the regular\r\noctahedron was ground down until the artificial facet thus produced was\r\nhalf the width of the stone, while the opposite corner was slightly\r\nground.\r\n\r\nStill another century elapsed before the introduction of the rose\r\npattern, which comprised twenty-four triangular facets and a flat base\r\n(Figs. 45-46), the stone being nearly hemispherical in shape. This\r\nstyle is said to have been the invention of Cardinal Mazarin, but\r\nprobably he was the first to have diamonds of any considerable size cut\r\nin this form. At the present day only tiny stones are cut as roses.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 45.—Rose Cut (top view).]\r\n\r\nA few more years passed away, and at length at the close of the\r\nseventeenth century diamond came by its own when Vincenzio Peruzzi, a\r\nVenetian, introduced the brilliant form of cutting, and revealed for\r\nthe first time its amazing ‘fire.’ Except for minor changes this form\r\nremains to this day the standard style for the shape of diamond, and\r\nthe word brilliant is commonly employed to denote diamond cut in this\r\nway. So obviously and markedly superior is the style to all others\r\nthat upon its discovery the owners of large roses had them re-cut as\r\nbrilliants despite the loss in weight necessitated by the change.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 46.—Rose Cut (side view).]\r\n\r\nThe brilliant form is derived from the old table by increasing the\r\nnumber of facets and slightly altering the angles pertaining to the\r\nnatural octahedron. In a perfect brilliant (Figs. 47-49) there are\r\naltogether 58 facets, 33 above and 25 below the girdle, as the edge\r\nseparating the upper and lower portions of the stone is termed, which\r\nare arranged in the following manner. Eight star-facets, triangular\r\nin shape, immediately surround the large table-facet. Next come four\r\nlarge templets or bezels, quadrilateral in form, arranged in pairs\r\non opposite sides of the table-facet, the four quoins or lozenges,\r\nsimilar in shape, coming intermediately between them; in modern\r\npractice, however, these two sets are identical in shape and size,\r\nand there are consequently eight facets of the same kind instead of\r\ntwo sets of four. The eight cross or skew facets and the eight skill\r\nfacets, in both sets the shape being triangular, form the boundary\r\nof the girdle; modern brilliants usually have instead sixteen facets\r\nof the same shape and size. The above 33 facets lie above the girdle\r\nand form the crown of the stone. Immediately opposite and parallel to\r\nthe table is the tiny culet. Next to the latter come the four large\r\npavilion facets with the four quoins intermediately between them,\r\nboth sets being five-sided but nearly quadrilateral in shape; these\r\nagain are usually combined into eight facets of the same size. Eight\r\ncross facets and eight skill facets, both sets, like those in the\r\ncrown, being triangular in shape, form the lower side of the girdle;\r\nthese also are generally united into a set of sixteen similar facets.\r\nThese 25 facets which lie below the girdle comprise the ‘pavilion,’\r\nor base of the stone. In a regular stone properly cut a templet is\r\nnearly parallel to a pavilion, and an upper to a lower cross facet. The\r\ncontour of the girdle is usually circular, but occasionally assumes\r\nless symmetrical shapes, as for instance in drop-stones or pendeloques,\r\nand the facets are at the same time distorted. The number of facets may\r\nwith advantage be increased in the case of large stones. An additional\r\nset of eight star facets is often placed round the culet, the total\r\nnumber then being 66. It may be mentioned that the largest stone cut\r\nfrom the Cullinan has the exceptional number of 74 facets.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 47.—Brilliant Cut (top view).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 48.—Brilliant Cut (base view).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 49.—Brilliant Cut (side view).]\r\n\r\nIn order to secure the finest optical effect certain proportions have\r\nbeen found necessary. The depth of the crown must be one-half that of\r\nthe base, and therefore one-third the total depth of the stone, and the\r\nwidth of the table must be slightly less than half that of the stone.\r\nThe culet should be quite small, not more in width than one-sixth of\r\nthe table; it is, in fact, not required at all except to avoid the\r\ndanger of the point splintering. The girdle should be as thin as is\r\ncompatible with strength sufficient to prevent chipping in the process\r\nof mounting the stone; if it were left thick, the rough edge would be\r\nvisible by reflection at the lower facets, and would, especially if at\r\nall dirty, seriously affect the quality of the stone. The shape of the\r\nstone is largely determined by the sizes of the templets in the crown\r\nand the pavilions in the base as compared with that of the table, or,\r\nwhat comes to the same thing, by the inclinations at which they are cut\r\nto that facet. If the table had actually half the width of the stone,\r\nthe angle[5] between it and a templet would be exactly half a right\r\nangle or 45°; it is, however, made somewhat smaller, namely, about 40°.\r\nA pavilion, being parallel to a templet, makes a similar angle with the\r\nculet. The cross facets are more steeply inclined, and make an angle\r\nof about 45° with the table or the culet, as the case may be. The star\r\nfacets, on the other hand, slant perceptibly less, and make an angle of\r\nonly about 26° with the table. A latitude of some 4° or 5° is possible\r\nwithout seriously affecting the ‘fire’ of the stone.\r\n\r\nThe object of the disposition of the facets on a brilliant is to assure\r\nthat all the light that enters the stone, principally by way of the\r\ntable, is wholly reflected from the base and emerges through the crown,\r\npreferably by way of the inclined facets. A brilliant-cut diamond, if\r\nviewed with the table between the observer and the light, appears quite\r\ndark except for the small amount of light escaping through the culet.\r\nLight should therefore fall on the lower facets at angles greater\r\nthan the critical angle of total-reflection, which for diamond is 24°\r\n26´. The pavilions should be inclined properly at double this angle,\r\nor 48° 52´, to the culet; but a ray that emerges at a pavilion in the\r\nactual arrangement entered the table at nearly grazing incidence, and\r\nthe amount of light entering this facet at such acute perspective is\r\nnegligible. On the other hand, after reflection at the base light must,\r\nin order to emerge, fall on the crown at less than the critical angle\r\nof total-reflection. In Fig. 50 are shown diagrammatically the paths\r\nof rays that entered the table in divers ways. The ray emerging again\r\nat the table suffers little or no dispersion and is almost white,\r\nbut those coming out through the inclined facets are split up into\r\nthe rainbow effect, known as ‘fire,’ for which diamond is so famous.\r\nIt is in order that so much of the light entering by the table may\r\nemerge through the inclined facets of the crown that the pavilions are\r\ninclined at not much more than 40° to the culet. It might be suggested\r\nthat instead of being faceted the stone should be conically shaped,\r\ntruncated above and nearly complete below. The result would no doubt\r\nbe steadier, but, on the other hand, far less pleasing. It is the\r\never-changing nuance that chiefly attracts the eye; now a brilliant\r\nflash of purest white, anon a gleam of cerulean blue, waxing to\r\nrichest orange and dying in a crimson glow, all intermingled with the\r\nmanifold glitter from the surface of the stone. Absolute cleanliness is\r\nessential if the full beauty of any stone is to be realized, but this\r\nis particularly true of diamond. If the back of the stone be clogged\r\nwith grease and dirt, as so often happens in claw-set rings, light is\r\nno longer wholly reflected from the base; much of it escapes, and the\r\namount of ‘fire’ is seriously diminished.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 50.—Course of the Rays of Light passing through a\r\nBrilliant.]\r\n\r\nNeedless to state, lapidaries make no careful angular measurements\r\nwhen cutting stones, but judge of the position of the facets entirely\r\nby eye. It sometimes therefore happens that the permissible limits\r\nare overstepped, in which event the stone is dead and may resist all\r\nefforts to vivify it short of the heroic course of re-cutting it, too\r\nexpensive a treatment in the case of small stones.\r\n\r\nThe factors that govern the properties of a brilliant-cut stone are\r\nlarge colour-dispersion, high refraction, and freedom from any trace of\r\nintrinsic colour. The only gem-stone that can vie with diamond in these\r\nrespects is zircon. Although it is rare to find a zircon naturally\r\nwithout colour, yet many kinds are easily deprived of their tint by\r\nthe application of heat. A brilliant-cut zircon is, indeed, far from\r\nreadily distinguished by eye from diamond, and has probably often\r\npassed as one, but it may easily be identified by its large double\r\nrefraction (cf. p. 41) and inferior hardness. The remaining colourless\r\nstones, such as white sapphire, topaz, and quartz (rock-crystal), have\r\ninsufficient refractivity to give total-reflection at the base, and,\r\nmoreover, they are comparatively deficient in ‘fire.’\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 51.—Step- or Trap-Cut (top view).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 52.—Step- or Trap-Cut (side view).]\r\n\r\nA popular style of cutting which is much in vogue for coloured stones\r\nis the step- or trap-cut, consisting of a table and a series of\r\nfacets with parallel horizontal edges (Figs. 51-52) above and below\r\nthe girdle; in recent jewellery, however, the top of the stone is\r\noften brilliant-cut. The contour may be oblong, square, lozenge, or\r\nheart-shaped, or have less regular forms. The table is sometimes\r\nslightly rounded. Since the object of this style is primarily to\r\ndisplay the intrinsic colour of the stone and not so much a brilliant\r\nplay of light from the interior, no attempt is made to secure\r\ntotal-reflection at the lower facets. The stone therefore varies in\r\ndepth according to its tint; if dark, it is cut shallow, lest light\r\nbe wholly absorbed within, and the stone appear practically opaque,\r\nbut if light, it is cut deep, in order to secure fullness of tint.\r\nMuch precision in shape and disposition of the facets is not demanded,\r\nand the stones are usually cut in such a way that, provided the\r\ndesired effect is obtained, the weight is kept as great as possible;\r\nwe may recall that stones are sold by weight. In considering what\r\nwill be the optical effect of any particular shape, regard must be\r\nhad to the effective colour of the transmitted light. For instance,\r\nalthough sapphire and ruby belong to the same species and have the\r\nsame refractive indices, yet, since the former transmits mainly blue\r\nand the latter red light, they have for practical purposes appreciably\r\ndifferent indices, and lapidaries find it therefore possible to cut\r\nthe base of ruby thicker than that of sapphire, and thus keep the\r\nweight greater. It is instructive too what can be done with the most\r\nunpromising material by the exercise of a little ingenuity. Thus Ceylon\r\nsapphires are often so irregularly coloured that considerable skill\r\nis called for in cutting them. A stone may, for instance, be almost\r\ncolourless except for a single spot of blue; yet, if the stone be\r\ncut steeply and the spot be brought to the base, the effect will be\r\nprecisely the same as if the stone were uniformly coloured, because all\r\nthe light emerging from the stone has passed through the spot at the\r\nbase and therefore been tinted blue.\r\n\r\nThe mechanism employed in the fashioning of gem-stones is simple in\r\ncharacter, and comprises merely metal plates or wheels for slitting,\r\nand discs or laps for grinding and polishing the stones, the former\r\nbeing set vertically and rotated about horizontal spindles, and the\r\nlatter set horizontally and rotated about vertical spindles. Mechanical\r\npower is occasionally used for driving both kinds of apparatus, but\r\ngenerally, especially in slitting and in delicate work, hand-power is\r\npreferred. In the East native lapidaries make use of vertical wheels\r\n(Plate XIII) also for grinding and polishing stones, which explains why\r\nnative-cut stones never have truly plane facets; it will be noticed\r\nfrom the picture that a long bow is used to drive the spindle.\r\n\r\nOwing to the unique hardness of diamond it can be fashioned only by\r\nthe aid of its own powder. The process differs therefore materially\r\nfrom the cutting of the remaining gem-stones, and will be described\r\nseparately. Indeed, so different are the two classes of work that firms\r\nseldom habitually undertake both.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of the excellent cleavage of diamond enormously reduced\r\nthe labour of cutting large stones. A stone containing a bad flaw may\r\nbe split to convenient shape in as many minutes as the days or even\r\nweeks required to grind it down. The improvement in the appliances and\r\nthe provision of ample mechanical power has further accelerated the\r\nprocess and reduced the cost. Two years were occupied in cutting the\r\ndiamond known as the Pitt or Regent, whereas in only six months the\r\ncolossal Cullinan was shaped into two large and over a hundred smaller\r\nstones with far less loss of material.\r\n\r\nAlthough the brilliant form was derived from the regular octahedron, it\r\nby no means follows that, because diamond can be cleaved to the latter\r\nform, such is the initial step in fashioning the rough mass. The aim of\r\nthe lapidary is to cut the largest possible stone from the given piece\r\nof rough, and the finished brilliant usually bears no relation whatever\r\nto the natural octahedron. The cleavage is utilized only to free the\r\nrough of an awkward and useless excrescence, or of flaws. Although the\r\noctahedron is one of the common forms in which diamond is found, it is\r\nrarely regular, and oftener than not one of the larger faces is made\r\nthe table.\r\n\r\nThe old method, which is still in use, for roughly fashioning diamonds\r\nis that known as bruting, from the French word, _brutage_, for the\r\nprocess, or as shaping. Two stones of about the same size are selected,\r\nand are firmly attached by means of a hard cement to the ends of\r\ntwo holders, which are held one in each hand, and rubbed hard, one\r\nagainst the other, until surfaces of the requisite size are developed\r\non each stone. During the process the stones are held over a small\r\nbox, which catches the precious powder. A fine sieve at the bottom\r\nof the box allows the powder to fall through into a tray underneath,\r\nbut holds back anything larger. By means of two vertical pins placed\r\none on each side of the box the holders are retained more easily in\r\nthe desired position, and the work is thrown mainly on the thumbs.\r\nThis work continued day after day has a very disfiguring effect upon\r\nthe hands despite the thick gloves that are worn to protect them; the\r\nskin of the thumbs grows hard and horny, and the first and second\r\nfingers become swollen and distorted. When the surfaces have thus been\r\nformed, the stone is handed to the polisher, who works them into the\r\ncorrect shape and afterwards polishes them, the stone passing backwards\r\nand forwards several times between the cutter and the polisher. The\r\ntable, four templets, culet and four pavilions are first formed and\r\npolished, so that the table has a square shape. Next the quoins are\r\ndeveloped and polished, and finally the small facets are polished on,\r\nnot being shaped first. In modern practice the process of bruting has\r\nbeen modified in some cases by the introduction of machinery, and the\r\nfacets are ground on, with considerable improvement in the regularity\r\nof their size and disposition, and reduction in the amount of polishing\r\nrequired. Moreover, to obviate the loss of material resulting from\r\ncontinued grinding, large stones are first sliced by means of\r\nrapidly-revolving copper wheels charged with diamond powder.\r\n\r\nThe laps used for polishing diamonds are made of a particular kind\r\nof soft iron, which is found to surpass any other metal in retaining\r\nthe diamond powder. They are rotated at a high rate of speed, which\r\nis about 2000 to 2500 revolutions a minute, and the heat developed by\r\nthe friction at this speed is too great for a cement to be used; a\r\nsolder or fusible alloy, composed of one part tin to three parts lead,\r\ntherefore takes its place. The solder is held in a hollow cup of brass\r\nwhich is from its shape called a ‘dop,’ an old Dutch word meaning\r\nshell. Its external diameter is ordinarily about 1½ in. (4 cm.), but\r\nlarger dops are, of course, used for large stones. A stout copper stalk\r\nis attached to the bottom of the dop; it is visible in the view of the\r\ndop shown at _e_ on Plate VI, and two slabs of solder are seen lying in\r\nfront of the dop. The dop containing the solder is placed in the midst\r\nof a non-luminous flame and heated until the solder softens, when it is\r\nremoved by means of the small tongs, _c_, and placed upright on a stand\r\nsuch as that shown at _a_. The long tongs, _d_, are used for shaping\r\nthe solder into a cone at the apex of which the diamond is placed. The\r\nsolder is worked well over the stone so that only the part to undergo\r\npolishing is exposed. A diamond in position is shown at _f_. The top of\r\nthe stand is saucer-shaped to catch the stone should it accidentally\r\nfall off the dop, and to prevent pieces of solder falling on the hand.\r\nWhile still hot, the dop with the diamond in position on the solder is\r\nplunged into cold water in order to cool it. The fact that the stone\r\nwithstands this drastic treatment is eloquent testimony to its good\r\nthermal conductivity; other gem-stones would promptly split into\r\nfragments. It may be remarked that so high is the temperature at which\r\ndiamond burns that it may be placed in the gas flame without any fear\r\nof untoward results. The dop is now ready for attachment to an arm\r\nsuch as that shown at _b_; the stalk of the dop is placed in a groove\r\nrunning across the split end of the arm, and is gripped tight by means\r\nof a screw worked by the nut which is visible in the picture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PLATE VI_\r\n\r\nAPPLIANCES USED FOR POLISHING DIAMONDS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PLATE VII_\r\n\r\nPOLISHING DIAMONDS]\r\n\r\nFour such arms, each with a dop, are used with the polishing lap (Plate\r\nVII), and each stands on two square legs on the bench. Pins, _p_, in\r\npairs are fixed to the bench to prevent the arms being carried round by\r\nthe friction; one near the lap holds the arm not far from the dop, and\r\nthe other engages in a strong metal tongue, which is best seen at the\r\nend of the arm _b_ on Plate VI. Though the arm, which is made of iron,\r\nis heavy, yet for polishing purposes it is insufficient, and additional\r\nlead weights are laid on the top of it, as in the case of the arm\r\nat the back on Plate VII. The copper stalk is strong, yet flexible,\r\nand can be bent to suit the position of the facet to be polished; on\r\nPlate VII the dops _a_ and _b_ are upright, but the other two are\r\ninclined. In addition to the powder resulting from bruting, boart,\r\n_i.e._ diamonds useless for cutting, are crushed up to supply polishing\r\nmaterial, and a little olive oil is used as a lubricant. Owing to the\r\nfriction so much heat is developed that even the solder would soften\r\nafter a time, and therefore, as a precaution, the dop is from time\r\nto time cooled by immersion in water. The stone has constantly to be\r\nre-set, about six being the maximum even of the tiny facets near the\r\ngirdle that can be dealt with by varying the inclination of the dop.\r\nAs the work approaches completion the stone is frequently inspected,\r\nlest the polishing be carried too far for the development of the proper\r\namount of ‘fire.’ When finished, the stones are boiled in sulphuric\r\nacid to remove all traces of oil and dirt.\r\n\r\nThe whole operation is evidently rough and ready in the extreme; but\r\nsuch amazing skill do the lapidaries acquire, that even the most\r\ncareful inspection by eye alone would scarce detect any want of proper\r\nsymmetry in a well-cut stone.\r\n\r\nThe fashioning of coloured stones, as all the gem-stones apart from\r\ndiamond are termed in the jewellery trade, is on account of their\r\ninferior hardness a far less tedious operation. They are easily\r\nslit, for which purpose a vertical wheel (Plate VIII) made of soft\r\niron is used; it is charged with diamond dust and lubricated with\r\noil, generally paraffin. When slit to the desired size, the stone is\r\nattached to a conveniently shaped holder by means of a cement, the\r\nconsistency of which varies with the hardness of the stone. It is\r\nset in the cement in such a way that the plane desired for the table\r\nfacet is at right angles to the length of the holder, and the whole of\r\nthe upper part or crown is finished before the stone is removed from\r\nthe cement. The lower half or base is treated in a similar manner.\r\nThus in the process of grinding and polishing the stone is only once\r\nre-set; as was stated above, diamond demands very different treatment.\r\nAgain, all coloured stones are ground down without any intermediate\r\noperation corresponding to bruting. The holder is merely held in the\r\nhand, but to maintain its position more exactly its other end,\r\nwhich is pointed, is inserted in one of the holes that are pierced at\r\nintervals in a vertical spindle placed at a convenient distance from\r\nthe lap (Plate VIII), which one depending upon the inclination of the\r\nfacet to be formed. For hard stones, such as ruby and sapphire, diamond\r\npowder is generally used as the abrasive agent, while for the softer\r\nstones emery, the impure corundum, is selected; in recent years the\r\nartificially prepared carborundum, silicide of carbon corresponding to\r\nthe formula CSi, which is harder than corundum, has come into vogue\r\nfor grinding purposes, but it is unfortunately useless for slitting,\r\nbecause it refuses to cling to the wheel. To efface the scratches left\r\nby the abrasive agent and to impart a brilliant polish to the facets,\r\nmaterial of less hardness, such as putty-powder, pumice, or rouge, is\r\nemployed; in all cases the lubricant is water. The grinding laps are\r\nmade of copper, gun-metal, or lead; and pewter or wooden laps, the\r\nlatter sometimes faced with cloth or leather, are used for polishing.\r\nAs a general rule, the harder the stone the greater the speed of the\r\nlap.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PLATE VIII_\r\n\r\nSLITTING COLOURED STONES\r\n\r\nPOLISHING COLOURED STONES]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PLATE IX_\r\n\r\nFACETING MACHINE]\r\n\r\nAs in the case of diamond, the lapidary judges of the position of the\r\nfacet entirely by eye and touch, but a skilled workman can develop\r\na facet very close to the theoretical position. During recent years\r\nvarious devices have been invented to enable him to do his work with\r\ngreater facility. A machine of this kind is illustrated on Plate IX.\r\nThe stone is attached by means of cement to the blunt end, _d_, of\r\nthe holder, _b_, which is of the customary kind, while the other end\r\nis inserted in a hole in a wooden piece, _a_, which is adjustable in\r\nheight by means of the screw above it. The azimuthal positions of the\r\nfacets are arranged by means of the octagonal collar, _c_, the sides\r\nof which are held successively in turn against the guide, _e_. The\r\nstand itself is clamped to the bench. The machine is, however, little\r\nused except for cheap stones, because it is too accurate and leads to\r\nwaste of material. Stones are sold by weight, and so long as the eye is\r\nsatisfied, no attempt is made to attain to absolute symmetry of shape.\r\n\r\nThe pictures on Plates X-XIII illustrate lapidaries’ workshops in\r\nvarious parts of the world. The first two show an office and a workshop\r\nsituated in Hatton Garden, London; in the former certain of the staff\r\nare selecting from the parcels stones suitable for cutting. The third\r\ndepicts a more primitive establishment at Ekaterinburg in the Urals.\r\nThe fourth shows a typical French family—_père_, _mère_, _et fils_—in\r\nthe Jura district, all busily engaged; on the table will be noticed a\r\nfaceting machine of the kind described above. In the fifth picture a\r\nnative lapidary in Calcutta is seen at work with the driving bow in his\r\nright, and the stone in his left, hand.\r\n\r\nA curious difference exists in the systems of charging for cutting\r\ndiamonds and coloured stones. The cost of cutting the latter is\r\nreckoned by the weight of the finished stone, the rate varying from\r\n1s. to 8s. a carat according to the character of the stone and the\r\ndifficulty of the work; while in the case of diamonds, on the other\r\nhand, the weight of the rough material determines the cost, the rate\r\nbeing about 10s. to 40s. a carat according to the size, which on the\r\naverage is equivalent to about 30s. to 120s. a carat calculated on\r\nthe weight of the finished stone. The reason of the distinction is\r\nobviously because the proper proportions in a brilliant-cut diamond\r\nmust be maintained, whatever be the loss in weight involved; in\r\ncoloured stones the shape is not of such primary importance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PLATE X_\r\n\r\nLAPIDARY’S WORKSHOP AND OFFICE IN ENGLAND]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PLATE XI_\r\n\r\nLAPIDARY’S WORKSHOP IN RUSSIA]\r\n\r\nWhen finished, the stone finds its way with others akin to it to the\r\nmanufacturing jeweller’s establishment, where it is handed to the\r\nsetter, who mounts it in a ring, necklace, brooch, or whatever article\r\nof jewellery it is intended for. The metal used in the groundwork of\r\nthe setting is generally gold, but platinum is also employed where an\r\nunobtrusive and untarnishable metal is demanded, and silver finds a\r\nplace in cheaper jewellery, although it is seriously handicapped by\r\nits susceptibility to the blackening influence of the sulphurous fumes\r\npresent in the smoke-laden atmosphere of towns. The stone may be either\r\nembedded in the metal or held by claws. The former is by far the safer,\r\nbut the latter the more elegant, and it has the advantage of exposing\r\nthe stone _à jour_, to use the French jewellers’ expression, so that\r\nits genuineness is more evidently testified. It is very important\r\nthat the claw setting be periodically examined, lest the owner one\r\nday experience the mortification of finding that a valuable stone has\r\ndropped out; gold, owing to its softness, wears away in course of time.\r\n\r\nUp to quite recent years modern jewellery was justly open to the\r\ncriticism that it was lacking in variety, that little attempt was made\r\nto secure harmonious association in either the colour or the lustre of\r\nthe gem-stones, and that the glitter of the gold mount was frequently\r\nfar too obtrusive. Gold consorts admirably with the rich glow of\r\nruby, but is quite unsuited to the gleaming fire of a brilliant. Where\r\nthe metal is present merely for the mechanical purpose of holding the\r\nstones in position, it should be made as little noticeable as possible.\r\nThe artistic treatment of jewellery is, however, receiving now adequate\r\nattention in the best Paris and London houses.

No ambiguity or confusion could arise if jewellers made use\r\nof the scientific names for the species, but most of them are unknown\r\nor at least unfamiliar to those unversed in mineralogy, and to banish\r\nold-established names is undesirable, even if the task were not\r\nhopeless. The name selected for a gem-stone may have a very important\r\nbearing on its fortunes. When the love-sick Juliet queried ‘What’s\r\nin a name?’ her mind was wandering far from jewels; for them a name\r\nis everything. The beautiful red stones that accompany the diamond\r\nin South Africa were almost a drug in the market under their proper\r\ntitle—garnet, but command a ready sale under the misnomer ‘Cape-ruby.’\r\nTo many minds there is a subtle satisfaction in the possession of a\r\nstone which is assumed to be a sort of ruby that would be destroyed by\r\nthe knowledge that the stone really belonged to the cinderella species\r\nof gem-stones—the despised garnet. For similar reasons it was deemed\r\nadvisable to offer the lustrous green garnet found some thirty and odd\r\nyears ago in the Ural Mountains as ‘olivine,’ not a happy choice since\r\ntheir colour is grass- rather than olive-green, apart from the fact\r\nthat the term is in general use in science for the species known in\r\njewellery as peridot.\r\n\r\nThe names employed in jewellery are largely based upon the colour, the\r\nleast reliable from a determinative point of view of all the physical\r\ncharacters of gem-stones. Qualifying terms are employed to distinguish\r\nstones of obviously different hardness. ‘Oriental’ distinguishes\r\nvarieties of corundum, but does not imply that they necessarily came\r\nfrom the East; the finest gem-stones originally reached Europe by that\r\nroad, and the hardest coloured stones consequently received that term\r\nof distinction.\r\n\r\nNearly all red stones are grouped under the name ruby, which is derived\r\nfrom a Latin word, _ruber_, meaning red, or under other names adapted\r\nfrom it, such as rubellite, rubicelle. It is properly applied to red\r\ncorundum; ‘balas’ ruby is spinel, which is associated with the true\r\nruby at the Burma mines and is similar in appearance to it when cut,\r\nand ‘Cape’ ruby, is, as has been stated above, a garnet from South\r\nAfrica. Rubellite is the lovely rose-pink tourmaline, fine examples of\r\nwhich have recently been discovered in California, and rubicelle is a\r\nless pronouncedly red spinel. Sapphire is by far the oldest and one\r\nof the most interesting of the words used in the language of jewels.\r\nIt occurs in Hebrew and Persian, ancient tongues, and means blue.\r\nIt was apparently employed for lapis lazuli or similar substance,\r\nbut was transferred to the blue corundum upon the discovery of this\r\nsplendid stone. Oblivious of the real meaning of the word, jewellers\r\napply it in a quasi-generic sense to all the varieties of corundum\r\nwith the exception of the red ruby, and give vent to such incongruous\r\nexpressions as ‘white sapphire,’ ‘yellow sapphire’; it is true such\r\nstones often contain traces of blue colour, but that is not the reason\r\nof the terms. ‘Brazilian’ sapphire is blue tourmaline, a somewhat rare\r\ntint for this species. The curious history of the word topaz will be\r\nfound below in the chapter dealing with the species of that name. It\r\nhas always denoted a yellow stone, and at the present day is applied\r\nby jewellers indiscriminately to the true topaz and citrine, the\r\nyellow quartz, the former, however, being sometimes distinguished by\r\nthe prefix ‘Brazilian.’ ‘Oriental’ topaz is corundum, and ‘occidental’\r\ntopaz is a term occasionally employed for the yellow quartz. Emerald,\r\nwhich means green, was first used for chrysocolla, an opaque greenish\r\nstone (p. 288), but was afterwards applied to the priceless green\r\nvariety of beryl, for which it is still retained. ‘Oriental’ emerald\r\nis corundum, ‘Brazilian’ emerald in the eighteenth century was a\r\ncommon term for the green tourmaline recently introduced to Europe,\r\nand ‘Uralian’ emerald has been tentatively suggested for the green\r\ngarnet more usually known as ‘olivine.’ Amethyst is properly the violet\r\nquartz, but with the prefix ‘oriental’ it is also applied to violet\r\ncorundum, though some jewellers use it for the brilliant quartz, with\r\npurple and white sectors, from Siberia. Almandine, which is derived\r\nfrom the name of an Eastern mart for precious stones, has come to\r\nsignify a stone of columbine-red hue, principally garnet, but with\r\nsuitable qualification corundum and spinel also.\r\n\r\nThe nomenclature of jewellery tends to suggest relations between the\r\ngem-stones for which there is no real foundation, and to obscure\r\nthe essential identity, except from the point of view of colour, of\r\nsapphire and ruby, emerald and aquamarine, cairngorm and amethyst.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n                          MANUFACTURED STONES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe initial step in the examination of a crystallized substance is\r\nto determine its physical characters and to resolve it by chemical\r\nanalysis into its component elements; the final, and by far the\r\nhardest, step is to build it up or synthetically prepare it from its\r\nconstituents. Unknown to the world at large, work of the latter kind\r\nhas long been going on within the walls of laboratories, and as the\r\nadvance in knowledge placed in the hands of experimenters weapons more\r\nand more comparable with those wielded by nature, their efforts have\r\nbeen increasingly successful. So stupendous, however, are the powers\r\nof nature that the possibility of reproducing, by human agency, the\r\ntreasured stones which are extracted from the earth in various parts\r\nof the globe at the cost of infinite toil and labour has always been\r\nderided by those ignorant of what had already been accomplished. Great,\r\ntherefore, was the consternation and the turmoil when concrete evidence\r\nthat could not be gainsaid showed that man’s restless efforts to\r\nbridle nature to his will were not in vain, and congresses of all the\r\nhigh-priests of jewellery were hastily convened to ban such unrighteous\r\nproducts, with what ultimate success remains to be seen.\r\n\r\nCrystallization may be caused in four different ways, of which the\r\nsecond alone has as yet yielded stones large enough to be cut—\r\n\r\n1. By the separation of the substance from a saturated solution. In\r\nnature the solvent may not be merely hot water, or water charged with\r\nan acid, but molten rock, and the temperature and the pressure may be\r\nexcessively high.\r\n\r\n2. By the solidification of the liquefied substance upon cooling. Ice\r\nis a familiar example of this type.\r\n\r\n3. By the sublimation of the vapour of the substance, which means the\r\ndirect passage from the vapour to the solid state without traversing\r\nthe usually intervening liquid state. It is usually the most difficult\r\nof attainment of the four methods; the most familiar instance is snow.\r\n\r\n4. By the precipitation of the substance from a solution when set free\r\nby chemical action.\r\n\r\nOther things being equal, the simpler the composition the greater is\r\nthe ease with which a substance may be expected to be formed; for,\r\ninstead of one complex substance, two or more different substances\r\nmay evolve, unless the conditions are nicely arranged. Attempts,\r\nfor instance, to produce beryl might result instead in a mixture of\r\nchrysoberyl, phenakite, and quartz.\r\n\r\nBy far the simplest in composition of all the precious stones is\r\ndiamond, which is pure crystallized carbon; but its manufacture is\r\nattended by well-nigh insuperable difficulties. If carbon be heated\r\nin air, it burns at a temperature well below its melting point;\r\nmoreover, unless an enormously high pressure is simultaneously applied,\r\nthe product is the other form of crystallized carbon, namely, the\r\ncomparatively worthless graphite. Moissan’s interesting course of\r\nexperiments were in some degree successful, but the tiny diamonds were\r\nworthless as jewels, and the expense involved in their manufacture was\r\nout of all proportion to any possible commercial value they might have.\r\n\r\nNext to diamond the simplest substances among precious stones are\r\nquartz (crystallized silica) and corundum (crystallized alumina). The\r\ncrystallization of silica has been effected in several ways, but the\r\nvalue in jewellery of quartz, even of the violet variety, amethyst, is\r\nnot such as to warrant its manufacture on a commercial scale. Corundum,\r\non the other hand, is held in high esteem; rubies and sapphires, of\r\ngood colour and free from flaws, have always commanded good prices. The\r\nquestion of their production by artificial means has therefore more\r\nthan academic interest.\r\n\r\nEver since the year 1837, when Gaudin produced a few tiny flakes,\r\nFrench experimenters have steadily prosecuted their researches in the\r\ncrystallization of corundum. Frémy and Feil, in 1877, were the first\r\nto meet with much success. A portion of one of their crucibles lined\r\nwith glistening ruby flakes is exhibited in the British Museum (Natural\r\nHistory).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 53.—Verneuil’s Inverted Blowpipe.]\r\n\r\nIn 1885 the jewellery market was completely taken by surprise by the\r\nappearance of red stones, emanating, so it is alleged, from Geneva;\r\nhaving the physical characters of genuine rubies, they were accepted\r\nas, and commanded the prices of, the natural stones. It was eventually\r\ndiscovered that they had resulted from the fusion of a number of\r\nfragments of natural rubies in the oxy-hydrogen flame. The original\r\ncolour was driven off at that high temperature, but was revived by the\r\nprevious addition of a little bichromate of potassium. Owing to the\r\ninequalities of growth, the cracks due to rapid cooling, the inclusion\r\nof air-bubbles, often so numerous as to cause a cloudy appearance,\r\nand, above all, the unnatural colour, these reconstructed stones, as\r\nthey are termed, were far from satisfactory, but yet they marked such\r\nan advance on anything that had been accomplished before that for some\r\ntime no suspicion was aroused as to their being other than natural\r\nstones.\r\n\r\nA notable advance in the synthesis of corundum, particularly of ruby,\r\nwas made in 1904, when Verneuil, who had served his apprenticeship\r\nto science under the guidance of Frémy, invented his ingenious\r\ninverted form of blowpipe (Fig. 53), which enabled him to overcome the\r\ndifficulties that had baffled earlier investigators, and to manufacture\r\nrubies vying in appearance after cutting with the best of nature’s\r\nproductions. The blowpipe consisted of two tubes, of which the upper,\r\n_E_, wide above, was constricted below, and passing down the centre of\r\nthe lower, _F_, terminated just above the orifice of the latter in\r\na fine nozzle. Oxygen was admitted at _C_ through the plate covering\r\nthe upper end of the tube, _E_. A rod, which passed through a rubber\r\ncollar in the same plate, supported inside the tube, _E_, a vessel,\r\n_D_, and at the upper end terminated in a small plate, on which was\r\nfixed a disc, _B_. The hammer, _A_, when lifted by the action of an\r\nelectromagnet and released, fell by gravity and struck the disc. The\r\nlatter could be turned about a horizontal axis placed eccentrically,\r\nso that the height through which the hammer fell and the consequent\r\nforce of the blow could be regulated. The rubber collar, which was\r\nperfectly gas-tight, held the rod securely, but allowed the shocks to\r\nbe transmitted to the vessel, _D_, an arrangement of guides maintaining\r\nthe slight motion of the vessel strictly vertical. This vessel, which\r\ncarried the alumina powder used in the manufacture of the stone, had as\r\nits base a cylindrical sieve of fine mesh. The succession of rapid taps\r\nof the hammer caused a regular feed of powder down the tube, the amount\r\nbeing regulated by varying the height through which the hammer fell.\r\nHydrogen or coal-gas was admitted at _G_ into the outer tube, _F_, and\r\nin the usual way met the oxygen just above the orifice, _L_. To exclude\r\nirregular draughts, the flame was surrounded by a screen, _M_, which\r\nwas provided with a mica window, and a water-jacket, _K_, protected the\r\nupper part of the apparatus from excessive heating.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 54.—‘Boule,’ or Pear-shaped Drop.]\r\n\r\nThe alumina was precipitated from a solution of pure ammonia—alum,\r\n(NH_{4})_{2}SO_{4}.Al_{2}(SO_{4})_{3}.24H_{2}O, in distilled water\r\nby the addition of pure ammonia, sufficient chrome-alum also being\r\ndissolved with the ammonia-alum to furnish about 2½ per cent. of\r\nchromic oxide in the resulting stone. The powder, carefully prepared\r\nand purified, was placed, as has been stated above, in the vessel,\r\n_D_, and on reaching the flame at the orifice it melted, and fell\r\nas a liquid drop, _N_, upon the pedestal, _P_, which was formed of\r\npreviously fused alumina. This pedestal was attached by a platinum\r\nsleeve to an iron rod, _Q_, which was provided with the necessary screw\r\nadjustments, _R_ and _S_, for centring and lowering it as the drop\r\ngrew in size. Great care was exercised to free the powder from any\r\ntrace of potassium, which, if present, imparted a brownish tinge to\r\nthe stone. The pressure of the oxygen, low initially both to prevent\r\nthe pedestal from melting, and to keep the area of the drop in contact\r\nwith the pedestal as small as possible, because otherwise flaws tended\r\nto start on cooling, was gradually increased until the flame reached\r\nthe critical temperature which kept the top of the drop melted, but\r\nnot boiling. The supply of powder was at the same time carefully\r\nproportioned to the pressure. The pedestal, _P_, was from time to time\r\nlowered, and the drop grew in the shape of a pear (Fig. 54), the apex\r\nof which was downwards and adhered to the pedestal by a narrow stalk.\r\nAs soon as the drop reached the maximum size possible with the size of\r\nthe flame, the gases were sharply and simultaneously cut off. After ten\r\nminutes or so the drop was lowered from the chamber, _M_, by the screw,\r\n_S_, and when quite cold was removed from the pedestal.\r\n\r\nVery few changes have been made in the method when adapted to\r\ncommercial use. Coal-gas has, however, entirely replaced the\r\ncostly hydrogen, and the hammer is operated by a cam instead of an\r\nelectromagnet, while, as may be seen from the view of a gem-stone\r\nfactory (Plate XIV), a number of blowpipes are placed in line so that\r\ntheir cams are worked by the same shaft, _a_. The fire-clay screen,\r\n_b_, surrounding the flame is for convenience of removal divided into\r\nhalves longitudinally, and a small hole is left in front for viewing\r\nthe stone during growth, a red glass screen, _c_, being provided in\r\nfront to protect the eyes from the intense glare. Half the fire-clay\r\nscreen of the blowpipe in the centre of the Plate has been removed to\r\nshow the arrangement of the interior. The centring and the raising\r\nand lowering apparatus, _d_, have been modified. The process is so\r\nsimple that one man can attend to a dozen or so of these machines, and\r\nit takes only one hour to grow a drop large enough to be cut into a\r\nten-carat stone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PLATE XIV_\r\n\r\nBLOWPIPE USED FOR THE MANUFACTURE OF RUBIES AND SAPPHIRES]\r\n\r\nThe drops, unless the finished stone is required to have a similar\r\npear shape, are divided longitudinally through the central core into\r\nhalves, which in both shape and orientation are admirably suited to the\r\npurposes of cutting; as a general rule, the drop splits during cooling\r\ninto the desired direction of its own accord.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 55.—Bubbles and Curved Striæ in Manufactured Ruby.]\r\n\r\nEach drop is a single crystalline individual, and not, as might have\r\nbeen anticipated, an alumina glass or an irregular aggregation of\r\ncrystalline fragments, and, if the drop has cooled properly, the\r\ncrystallographic axis is parallel to the core of the pear. The cut\r\nstone will therefore have not only the density and hardness, but also\r\nall the optical characters—refractivity, double refraction, dichroism,\r\netc.—pertaining to the natural species, and will obey precisely the\r\nsame tests with the refractometer and the dichroscope. Were it not for\r\ncertain imperfections it would be impossible to distinguish between the\r\nstones formed in Nature’s vast workshop and those produced within the\r\nconfines of a laboratory. The artificial stones, however, are rarely,\r\nif ever, free from minute air-bubbles (Fig. 55), which can easily be\r\nseen with an ordinary lens. Their spherical shape differentiates them\r\nfrom the plane-sided cavities not infrequently visible in a natural\r\nstone (Fig. 56). Moreover, the colouring matter varies slightly, but\r\nimperceptibly, in successive shells, and consequently in the finished\r\nstone a careful eye can discern the curved striations (Fig. 55)\r\ncorresponding in shape to the original shell. In a natural stone, on\r\nthe other hand, although zones of different colours or varying shades\r\nare not uncommon, the resulting striations are straight (Fig. 56),\r\ncorresponding to the plane faces of the original crystal form. By\r\nsacrificing material it might be possible to cut a small stone free\r\nfrom bubbles, but the curved striations would always be present to\r\nbetray its origin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 56.—Markings in Natural Ruby.]\r\n\r\nThe success that attended the manufacture of ruby encouraged efforts to\r\nimpart other tints to crystallized alumina. By reducing the percentage\r\namount of chromic oxide, pink stones were turned out, in colour not\r\nunlike those Brazilian topazes, the original hue of which has been\r\naltered by the application of heat. These artificial stones have\r\ntherefore been called ‘scientific topaz’; of course, quite wrongly,\r\nsince topaz, which is properly a fluo-silicate of aluminium, is quite a\r\ndifferent substance.\r\n\r\nEarly attempts made to obtain the exquisite blue tint of the true\r\nsapphire were frustrated by an unexpected difficulty. The colouring\r\nmatter, cobalt oxide, was not diffused evenly through the drop, but\r\nwas huddled together in splotches, and it was found necessary to add a\r\nconsiderable amount of magnesia as a flux before a uniform distribution\r\nof colour could be secured. It was then discovered that, despite the\r\ncolour, the stones had the physical characters, not of sapphire, but\r\nof the species closely allied to it, namely, spinel, aluminate of\r\nmagnesium. By an unsurpassable effort of nomenclature these blue stones\r\nwere given the extraordinary name of ‘Hope sapphire,’ from fanciful\r\nanalogy with the famous blue diamond which was once the pride of the\r\nHope collection. A blue spinel is occasionally found in nature, but the\r\nactual tint is somewhat different. These manufactured stones have the\r\ndisadvantage of turning purple in artificial light. By substituting\r\nlime for magnesia as a flux, Paris, a pupil of Verneuil’s, produced\r\nblue stones which were not affected to the same extent. The difficulty\r\nwas at length overcome at the close of 1909, when Verneuil, by\r\nemploying as tinctorial agents 0·5 per cent. of titanium oxide and 1·5\r\nper cent. of magnetic iron oxide, succeeded in producing blue corundum;\r\nit, however, had not quite the tint of sapphire. Stones subsequently\r\nmanufactured, which were better in colour, contained about 0·12 per\r\ncent. of titanium oxide, but no iron at all.\r\n\r\nBy the addition to the alumina of a little nickel oxide and vanadium\r\noxide respectively, yellow and yellowish green corundums have been\r\nobtained. The latter have in artificial light a distinctly reddish\r\nhue, and have therefore been termed ‘scientific alexandrite’; of\r\ncourse, quite incorrectly, since the true alexandrite is a variety of\r\nchrysoberyl, aluminate of beryllium, a very different substance.\r\n\r\nIf no colouring matter at all be added and the alum be free from\r\npotash, colourless stones or white sapphires are formed, which pass\r\nunder the name ‘scientific brilliant.’ It is scarcely necessary to\r\nremark that they are quite distinct from the true brilliant, diamond.\r\n\r\nThe high prices commanded by emeralds, and the comparative success that\r\nattended the reconstruction of ruby from fragments of natural stones,\r\nsuggested that equal success might follow from a similar process with\r\npowdered beryl, chromic oxide being used as the colouring agent. The\r\nresulting stones are, indeed, a fair imitation, being even provided\r\nwith flaws, but they are a beryl glass with lower specific gravity and\r\nrefractivity than the true beryl, and are wrongly termed ‘scientific\r\nemerald.’ Moreover, recently most of the stones so named on the market\r\nare merely green paste.\r\n\r\nIt is unfortunate that the real success which has been achieved in the\r\nmanufacture of ruby and sapphire should be obscured by the ill-founded\r\nclaims tacitly asserted in other cases.\r\n\r\nAt the time the manufactured ruby was a novelty it fetched as much as\r\n£6 a carat, but as soon as it was discovered that it could easily\r\nbe differentiated from the natural stone, a collapse took place, and\r\nthe price fell abruptly to 30s., and eventually to 5s. and even 1s.\r\na carat. The sapphires run slightly higher, from 2s. to 7s. a carat.\r\nThe prices of the natural stones, which at first had fallen, have now\r\nrisen to almost their former level. The extreme disparity at present\r\nobtaining between the prices of the artificial and the natural ruby\r\nrenders the fraudulent substitution of the one for the other a great\r\ntemptation, and it behoves purchasers to beware where and from whom\r\nthey buy, and to be suspicious of apparently remarkable bargains,\r\nespecially at places like Colombo and Singapore where tourists abound.\r\nIt is no secret that some thousands of carats of manufactured rubies\r\nare shipped annually to the East. _Caveat emptor._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XV\r\n\r\n                           IMITATION STONES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe beryl glass mentioned in the previous chapter marks the transition\r\nstage between manufactured stones which in all essential characters\r\nare identical with those found in nature, and artificial stones which\r\nresemble the corresponding natural stone in outward appearance only. In\r\na sense both sorts may be styled artificial, but it would be misleading\r\nto confound them under the same appellation.\r\n\r\nCommon paste,[6] which is met with in drapery goods and cheap ornaments\r\nin general—hat-pins, buckles, and so forth—is composed of ordinary\r\ncrown-glass or flint-glass, the refractive indices being about 1·53 and\r\n1·63 respectively. The finest quality, which is used for imitations of\r\nbrilliants, is called ‘strass.’ It is a dense lead flint-glass of high\r\nrefraction and strong colour-dispersion, consisting of 38·2 per cent.\r\nof silica, 53·3 red lead (oxide of lead), and 7·8 potassium carbonate,\r\nwith small quantities of soda, alumina, and other substances. How\r\nadmirable these imitations may be, a study of the windows of a shop\r\ndevoted to such things will show. Unfortunately the addition of\r\nlead, which is necessary for imparting the requisite refraction and\r\n‘fire’ to the strass, renders the stones exceedingly soft. All glass\r\nyields to the file, but strass stones are scratched even by ordinary\r\nwindow-glass. If worn in such a way that they are rubbed, they\r\nspeedily lose the brilliance of their polish, and, moreover, they are\r\nsusceptible to attack by the sulphurous fumes present in the smoky air\r\nof towns, and turn after a time a dirty brown in hue. When coloured\r\nstones are to be imitated, small quantities of a suitable metallic\r\noxide are fused with the glass; cobalt gives rise to a royal-blue tint,\r\nchromium a ruby red, and manganese a violet. Common paste is not highly\r\nrefractive enough to give satisfactory results when cut as a brilliant,\r\nand the bases are therefore often coated with quicksilver, or, in the\r\ncase of old jewellery, covered with foil in the setting, in order to\r\nsecure more complete reflection from the interior. The fashioning of\r\nthese imitation stones is easy and cheap. Being moulded, they do not\r\nrequire cutting, and the polishing of the facets thus formed is soon\r\ndone on account of the softness of the stones.\r\n\r\nA test with a file readily differentiates paste stones from the natural\r\nstones they pretend to be. Being necessarily singly refractive, they\r\nare, of course, lacking in dichroism, and their refractivity seldom\r\naccords even approximately with that of the corresponding natural stone.\r\n\r\nIn order to meet the test for hardness the doublet was devised. Such\r\na stone is composed of two parts—the crown consisting of colourless\r\nquartz or other inexpensive real and hard stone, and the base being\r\nmade up of coloured glass. When the imitation, say of a sapphire, is\r\nintended to be more exact, the crown is made of a real sapphire, but\r\none deficient in colour, the requisite tint being obtained from the\r\npaste forming the under part of the doublet. In case the base should\r\nalso be tested for hardness the triplet has been devised. In this the\r\nbase is made of a real stone also, and the coloured paste is confined\r\nto the girdle section, where it is hidden by the setting. Sapphires and\r\nemeralds of indifferent colour are sometimes slit across the girdle;\r\nthe interior surfaces are polished, and colouring matter is introduced\r\nwith the cement, generally Canada balsam, which is used to re-unite the\r\ntwo portions of the stone together. All such imitations may be detected\r\nby placing the stone in oil, when the surfaces separating the portions\r\nof the composite stone will be visible, or the binding cement may be\r\ndissolved by immersing the stone, if unmounted, in boiling water, or in\r\nalcohol or chloroform, when the stone will fall to pieces.\r\n\r\nThe glass imitations of pearls, which have become very common in recent\r\nyears, may, apart from their inferior iridescence, be detected by\r\ntheir greater hardness, or by the apparent doubling of, say, a spot of\r\nink placed on the surface, owing to reflection from the inner surface\r\nof the glass shell. They are made of small hollow spheres formed by\r\nblowing. Next to the glass comes a lining of parchment size, and next\r\nthe under lining, which is the most important part of the imitation,\r\nconsisting of a preparation of fish scales called _Essence d’Orient_,\r\nWhen the lining is dry, the globe is filled with hot wax to impart the\r\nnecessary solidity. In cheap imitations the glass balls are not lined\r\nat all, but merely heated with hydrochloric acid to give an iridescence\r\nto the surface; sometimes they are coated with wax, which can be\r\nscraped off with a knife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           PART II—SECTION A\r\n\r\n                            PRECIOUS STONES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\n                                DIAMOND\r\n\r\n\r\nDiamond has held pride of place as chief of precious stones ever\r\nsince the discovery of the form of cutting known as the ‘brilliant’\r\nrevealed to full perfection its amazing qualities; and justly so,\r\nsince it combines in itself extreme hardness, high refraction, large\r\ncolour-dispersion, and brilliant lustre. A rough diamond, especially\r\nfrom river gravels, has often a peculiar greasy appearance, and is\r\nno more attractive to the eye than a piece of washing-soda. It is\r\ntherefore easy to understand why the Persians in the thirteenth century\r\nplaced the pearl, ruby, emerald, and even peridot before it, and\r\nwriters in the Middle Ages frequently esteemed it below emerald and\r\nruby. The Indian lapidaries, who were the first to realize that diamond\r\ncould be ground with its own powder, discovered what a wonderful\r\ndifference the removal of the skin makes in the appearance of a stone.\r\nThey, however, made no attempt to shape a stone, but merely polished\r\nthe natural facets, and only added numerous small facets when they\r\nwished to conceal flaws or other imperfections; indeed, the famous\r\ntraveller, Tavernier, from whom most of our knowledge of early mining\r\nin India is obtained, invariably found that a stone covered with many\r\nfacets was badly flawed. The full radiant beauty of a diamond comes to\r\nlight only when it is cut in brilliant form.\r\n\r\nOf all precious stones diamond has the simplest composition; it is\r\nmerely crystallized carbon, another form of which is the humble and\r\nuseful graphite, commonly known as ‘black-lead.’ Surely nature has\r\nsurpassed all her marvellous efforts in producing from the same element\r\nsubstances with such divergent characters as the hard, brilliant, and\r\ntransparent diamond and the soft, dull, and opaque graphite. It is,\r\nhowever, impossible to draw any sharp dividing line between the two;\r\nsoft diamond passes insensibly into hard graphite, and vice versa.\r\nBoart, or bort, as it is sometimes written, is composed of minute\r\ncrystals of diamond arranged haphazardly; it possesses no cleavage,\r\nits hardness is greater than that of the crystals, and its colour is\r\ngreyish to blackish. Carbon, carbonado, or black diamond, which is\r\ncomposed of still more minute crystals, is black and opaque, and is\r\nperceptibly harder than the crystals. It passes into graphite, which\r\nvaries in hardness, and may have any density between 2·O and 3·O.\r\nJewellers apply the term boart to crystals or fragments which are of no\r\nservice as gems; such pieces are crushed to powder and used for cutting\r\nand polishing purposes.\r\n\r\nDiamonds, when absolutely limpid and free from flaws, are said to be\r\nof the ‘first water,’ and are most prized when devoid of any tinge of\r\ncolour except perhaps bluish (Plate I, Fig. 1). Stones with a slight\r\ntinge of yellow are termed ‘off-coloured,’ and are far less valuable.\r\nThose of a canary-yellow colour (Plate I, Fig. 3), however, belong to a\r\ndifferent category, and have a decided attractiveness. Greenish stones\r\nalso are common, though it is rare to come across one with a really\r\ngood shade of that colour. Brown stones, especially in South Africa,\r\nare not uncommon. Pink stones are less common, and ruby-red and blue\r\nstones are rare. Those of the last-named colour have usually what is\r\nknown as a ‘steely’ shade, _i.e._ they are tinged with green; stones of\r\na sapphire blue are very seldom met with, and such command high prices.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGS. 57—59.—Diamond Crystals.]\r\n\r\nDiamond crystallizes (Figs. 57—59 and Plate I, Fig. 2) in octahedra\r\nwith brilliant, smooth faces, and occasionally in cubes with rough\r\npitted faces; sometimes three or six faces take the place of each\r\noctahedron face, and the stone is almost spherical in shape. The\r\nsurfaces of the crystals are often marked with equilateral triangles,\r\nwhich are supposed to represent the effects of incipient combustion.\r\nTwinned crystals, in which the two individuals may be connected by a\r\nsingle plane or may be interpenetrating, a star shape often resulting\r\nin the latter case, are common; sometimes, if of the octahedron type,\r\nthey are beautifully symmetrical. The rounded crystals are frequently\r\ncovered with a peculiar gum-like skin which is somewhat less hard than\r\nthe crystal itself. A large South African stone, weighing 27 grams (130\r\ncarats) and octahedral in shape, which was the gift of John Ruskin,\r\nand named by him the ‘Colenso’ after the first bishop of Natal, is\r\nexhibited in the British Museum (Natural History); its appearance is,\r\nhowever, marred by its distinctly ‘off-coloured’ tint.\r\n\r\nThe refraction of diamond is single, but local double refraction is\r\ncommon, indicating a state of strain which can often be traced to an\r\nincluded drop of liquid carbonic acid; so great is the strain that many\r\na fine stone has burst to fragments on being removed from the ground\r\nin which it has lain. The refractive index for the yellow light of a\r\nsodium flame is 2·4175, and the slight variation from this mean value\r\nthat has been observed, amounting only to 0·0001, testifies to the\r\npurity of the composition. The colour-dispersion is large, being as\r\nmuch as 0·044, in which respect it surpasses all colourless stones,\r\nbut is exceeded by sphene and the green garnet from the Urals (cf. p.\r\n217). The lustre of diamond, when polished, is so characteristic as to\r\nbe termed adamantine, and is due to the combination of high refraction\r\nand extreme hardness. Diamond is translucent to the X (Röntgen) rays;\r\nit phosphoresces under the action of radium, and of a high-tension\r\nelectric current when placed in a vacuum tube, and sometimes even when\r\nexposed to strong sunlight. Some diamonds fluoresce in sunlight,\r\nturning milky, and a few even emit light when rubbed. Crookes found\r\nthat a diamond buried in radium bromide for a year had acquired a\r\nlovely blue tint, which was not affected even by heating to redness.\r\nThe specific gravity is likewise constant, being 3·521, with a possible\r\nvariation from that mean value of 0·005; but a greater range, as might\r\nbe expected, is found in the impure boart.\r\n\r\nDiamond is by far the hardest substance in nature, being marked 10 in\r\nMohs’s scale of hardness, but it varies in itself; stones from Borneo\r\nand New South Wales are so perceptibly harder than those usually in\r\nthe lapidaries’ hands, that they can be cut only with their own and\r\nnot ordinary diamond powder, and some difficulty was experienced in\r\ncutting them when they first came into the market. It is interesting\r\nto note that the metal tantalum, the isolation of which in commercial\r\namount constituted one of the triumphs of chemistry of recent years,\r\nhas about the same hardness as diamond. Despite its extreme hardness\r\ndiamond readily cleaves under a heavy blow in planes parallel to the\r\nfaces of the regular octahedron, a property utilized for shaping the\r\nstone previous to cutting it. The fallacious, but not unnatural,\r\nidea was prevalent up to quite modern times that a diamond would,\r\neven if placed on an anvil, resist a blow from a hammer: who knows\r\nhow many fine stones have succumbed to this illusory test? The fact\r\nthat diamond could be split was known to Indian lapidaries at the\r\ntime of Tavernier’s visit, and it would appear from De Boodt that in\r\nthe sixteenth century the cleavability of diamond was not unknown in\r\nEurope, but it was not credited at the time and was soon forgotten.\r\nEarly last century Wollaston, a famous chemist and mineralogist,\r\nrediscovered the property, and, so it is said, used his knowledge to\r\nsome profit by purchasing large stones, which because of their awkward\r\nshape or the presence of flaws in the interior were rejected by the\r\nlapidaries, and selling them back again after cleaving them to suitable\r\nforms.\r\n\r\nIt has already been remarked (p. 79) that the interval in hardness\r\nbetween diamond and corundum, which comes next to it in Mohs’s scale,\r\nis enormously greater than that between corundum and the softest of\r\nminerals. Diamond can therefore be cut only with the aid of its own\r\npowder, and the cutting of diamond is therefore differentiated from\r\nthat of other stones, the precious-stone trade being to a large extent\r\ndivided into two distinct groups, namely, dealers in diamonds, and\r\ndealers in all other gem-stones.\r\n\r\nThe name of the species is derived from the popular form, _adiamentem_,\r\nof the Latin _adamantem_, itself the alliterative form of the Greek\r\nἀδάμας, meaning the unconquerable, in allusion not merely to the\r\ngreat hardness but also to the mistaken idea already mentioned. Boart\r\nprobably comes from the Old-French _bord_ or _bort_, bastard.\r\n\r\nAt the present day diamonds are usually cut as brilliants, though\r\nthe contour of the girdle may be circular, oval, or drop-shaped to\r\nsuit the particular purpose for which the stone is required, or to\r\nkeep the weight as great as possible. Small stones for bordering a\r\nlarge coloured stone may also be cut as roses or points. A perfect\r\nbrilliant has 58 facets, but small stones may have not more than 44,\r\nand exceptionally large stones may with advantage have many more; for\r\ninstance, on the largest stone cut from the Cullinan diamond there are\r\nno fewer than 74 facets.\r\n\r\nThe description of the properties of diamond would not be complete\r\nwithout a reference to the other valuable, if utilitarian, purposes\r\nto which it is put. Without its aid much of modern engineering work\r\nand mining operations would be impossible except at the cost of almost\r\nprohibitive expenditure of time and money.\r\n\r\nBoring through solid rock has been greatly facilitated by the use of\r\nthe diamond drill. For this purpose carbonado or black diamond is more\r\nserviceable than single crystals, and the price of the former has\r\nconsequently advanced from a nominal figure up to £3 to £12 a carat.\r\nThe actual working part of the drill consists of a cast-steel ring.\r\nThe crown of it has a number of small depressions at regular intervals\r\ninto which the carbonados are embedded. On revolution of the drill an\r\nannular ring is cut, leaving a solid core which can be drawn to the\r\nsurface. For cooling the drill and for washing away the detritus water\r\nis pumped through to the working face. The duration of the carbonados\r\ndepends on the nature of the rock and the skill of the operator. The\r\nmost troublesome rock is a sandstone or one with sharp differences in\r\nhardness, because the carbonados are liable to be torn out of their\r\nsetting. An experienced operator can tell by the feel of the drill the\r\nnature of the rock at the working face, and by varying the pressure can\r\nmitigate the risk of damage to the drill.\r\n\r\nThe tenacity of diamond renders it most suitable for wire-drawing. The\r\ntungsten filaments used in many of the latest forms of incandescent\r\nelectric lamps are prepared in this manner.\r\n\r\nDiamond powder is used for cutting and turning the hardened steel\r\nemployed in modern armaments and for other more peaceful purposes.\r\n\r\nAlthough nearly all the gem-stones scratch glass, diamond alone can be\r\nsatisfactorily employed to cut it along a definite edge. Any flake at\r\nrandom will not be suitable, because it will tear the glass and form a\r\njagged edge. The best results are given by the junction of two edges\r\nwhich do not meet in too obtuse an angle; two edges of the rhombic\r\ndodecahedron meet the requirements admirably. The stones used by the\r\nglaziers are minute in size, being not much larger than a pin’s head,\r\nand thirty of them on an average go to the carat. They are set in\r\ncopper or brass. Some little skill is needed to obtain the best results.\r\n\r\nThe value of a diamond has always been determined largely by the size\r\nof the stone, the old rule being that the rate per carat should be\r\nmultiplied by the square of the weight in carats; thus, if the rate be\r\n£10, the cost of a two-carat stone is four times this sum, or £40, of\r\na three-carat stone £90, and so on. For a century, from 1750 to 1850,\r\nthe rate remained almost constant at £4 for rough, £6 for rose-cut,\r\nand £8 for brilliant-cut diamonds. Since the latter date, owing to\r\nthe increase in the supply of gold, the growth of the spending power\r\nof the world, and the gradual falling off in the productiveness of\r\nthe Brazilian fields, the rate steadily increased about 10 per cent.\r\neach year, until in 1865 the rate for brilliants was £18. The rise was\r\nchecked by the discovery of the South African mines; moreover. since\r\ncomparatively large stones are plentiful in these mines, the rule\r\nof the increase in the price of a stone by the square of its weight\r\nno longer holds. The rate for the most perfect stones still remains\r\nhigh, because such are not so common in the South African mines. The\r\nclassification[7] adopted by the syndicate of London diamond merchants\r\nwho place upon the market the output of the De Beers group of mines is\r\nas follows:—(_a_) Blue-white, (_b_) white, (_c_) silvery Cape, (_d_)\r\nfine Cape, (_e_) Cape, (_f_) fine bywater, (_g_) bywater, (_h_) fine\r\nlight brown, (_i_) light brown, (_j_) brown, (_k_) dark brown. Bywaters\r\nor byes are stones tinged with yellow.\r\n\r\nThe rate per carat for cut stones in the blue-white and the bywater\r\ngroups is:—\r\n\r\n                          BLUE-WHITE.        BYWATER.\r\n  5-carat stone             £40-60            £20-25\r\n  1      „                   30-40             10-15\r\n  ½      „                   20-25              8-12\r\n  ¼      „                   15-18              6-10\r\n  Mêlée                      12-15              5-8\r\n\r\nMêlée are stones smaller than a quarter of a carat. It will be noticed\r\nthat the prices depart largely from the old rule; thus taking the rate\r\nfor a carat blue-white stone, the price of a five-carat stone should\r\nbe from £150-200 a carat, and for a quarter-carat stone only £7, 10s.\r\nto £10 a carat. There happens to be at the time of writing very little\r\ndemand for five-carat stones. Of course, the prices given are subject\r\nto constant fluctuation depending upon the supply and demand, and the\r\nwhims of fashion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\n                         OCCURRENCE OF DIAMOND\r\n\r\n\r\nThe whole of the diamonds known in ancient times were obtained from\r\nthe so-called Golconda mines in India. Golconda itself, now a deserted\r\nfortress near Hyderabad, was merely the mart where the diamonds were\r\nbought and sold. The diamond-bearing district actually spread over a\r\nwide area on the eastern side of the Deccan, extending from the Pinner\r\nRiver in the Madras Presidency northwards to the Rivers Son and Khan,\r\ntributaries of the Ganges, in Bundelkhand. The richest mines, where\r\nthe large historical stones were found, are in the south, mostly\r\nnear the Kistna River. The diamonds were discovered in sandstone,\r\nor conglomerate, or the sands and gravels of river-beds. The mines\r\nwere visited in the middle of the seventeenth century by the French\r\ntraveller and jeweller, Tavernier, when travelling on a commission\r\nfor Louis XIV, and he afterwards published a careful description of\r\nthem and of the method of working them. The mines seem to have been\r\nexhausted in the seventeenth century; at any rate, the prospecting,\r\nwhich has been spasmodically carried on during the last two centuries,\r\nhas proved almost abortive. With the exception of the Koh-i-nor, all\r\nthe large Indian diamonds were probably discovered not long before\r\nTavernier’s visit. The diamonds known to Pliny, and in his time, were\r\nquite small, and it is doubtful if any stones of considerable size came\r\nto light before A.D. 1000.\r\n\r\nIndia enjoyed the monopoly of supplying the world’s demand for diamonds\r\nup to the discovery, in 1725, of the precious stone in Brazil. Small\r\nstones were detected by the miners in the gold washings at Tejuco,\r\nabout eighty miles (129 km.) from Rio de Janeiro, in the Serro do Frio\r\ndistrict of the State of Minas Geraes. The discovery naturally caused\r\ngreat excitement. So many diamonds were found that in 1727 something\r\nlike a slump took place in their value. In order to keep up prices, the\r\nDutch merchants, who mainly controlled the Indian output, asserted that\r\nthe diamonds had not been found in Brazil at all, but were inferior\r\nIndian stones shipped to Brazil from Goa. The tables were neatly turned\r\nwhen diamonds were actually shipped from Brazil to Goa, and exported\r\nthence to Europe as Indian stones. This course and the continuous\r\ndevelopment of the diamond district in Brazil rendered it impossible\r\nto hoodwink the world indefinitely. The drop in prices was, however,\r\nstayed by the action of the Portuguese government, who exacted such\r\nheavy duties and imposed such onerous conditions that finally no one\r\nwould undertake to work the mines. Accordingly, in 1772 diamond-mining\r\nwas declared a royal monopoly in Brazil, and such it remained until\r\nthe severance of Brazil from Portugal in 1834, when private mining was\r\npermitted by the new government subject to the payment of reasonable\r\nroyalties. The industry was enormously stimulated by the discovery, in\r\n1844, of the remarkably rich fields in the State of Bahia, especially\r\nat Serra da Cincorá, where carbonado, or black diamond, first came to\r\nlight, but after a few years, owing to the difficulties of supplying\r\nlabour, the unhealthiness of the climate, and the high cost of living,\r\nthe yield fell off and gradually declined, until the importance of the\r\nfields was finally eclipsed by the rise of the South African mines.\r\nThe Brazilian mines have proved very productive, but chiefly in small\r\ndiamonds, stones above a carat in weight being few in comparison. The\r\nlargest stone, to which the name, the Star of the South, was applied,\r\nweighed in the rough 254½ carats; it was discovered at the Bagagem\r\nmines in 1853. The quality of the diamonds is good, many of them having\r\nthe highly-prized bluish-white colour. The principal diamond-bearing\r\ndistricts of Brazil centre at Diamantina, as Tejuco was re-named\r\nafter the discovery of diamonds, Grão Magor, and Bagagem in the State\r\nof Minas Geraes, at Diamantina in the State of Bahia, and at Goyãz\r\nand Matto Grosso in the States of the same names. The diamonds occur\r\nchiefly in _cascalho_, a gravel, containing large masses of quartz\r\nand small particles of gold, which is supposed to be derived from a\r\nquartzose variety of micaceous slate known as itacolumite. The mines\r\nare now to some extent being worked by systematic dredging of the\r\nriver-beds.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1867 the children of a Boer farmer, Daniel Jacobs, who dwelt\r\nnear Hopetown on the banks of the Orange River, picked up in the course\r\nof play near the river a white pebble, which was destined not only to\r\nmark the commencement of a new epoch in the record of diamond mines,\r\nbut to change the whole course of the history of South Africa. This\r\npebble attracted the attention of a neighbour, Schalk van Niekerk, who\r\nsuspected that it might be of some value, and offered to buy it. Mrs.\r\nJacobs, however, gave it him, laughingly scouting the idea of accepting\r\nmoney for a mere pebble. Van Niekerk showed it to a travelling trader,\r\nby name John O’Reilly, who undertook to obtain what he could for it on\r\ncondition that they shared the proceeds. Every one he met laughed to\r\nscorn the idea that the stone had any value, and it was once thrown\r\naway and only recovered after some search in a yard, but at length he\r\nshowed it to Lorenzo Boyes, the Acting Civil Commissioner at Colesberg,\r\nwho, from its extreme hardness, thought it might be diamond and sent\r\nit to the mineralogist, W. Guybon Atherston, of Grahamstown, for\r\ndetermination. So uncertain was Boyes of its value that he did not even\r\nseal up the envelope containing it, much less register the package.\r\nAtherston found immediately that the long-scorned pebble was really\r\na fine diamond, weighing 21-3/16 carats, and with O’Reilly’s consent\r\nhe submitted it to Sir Philip Wodehouse, Governor at the Cape. The\r\nlatter purchased it at once for £500, and dispatched it to be shown\r\nat the Paris Exhibition of that year. It did not, however, attract\r\nmuch attention; chimerical tales of diamond finds in remote parts of\r\nthe world are not unknown. Indeed, for some time only a few small\r\nstones were picked up beside the Orange River, and no one believed in\r\nthe existence of any extensive diamond deposit. However, all doubt as\r\nto the advisibility of prospecting the district was settled by the\r\ndiscovery of the superb diamond, afterwards known as the ‘Star of\r\nSouth Africa,’ which was picked up in March 1869 by a shepherd boy\r\non the Zendfontein farm near the Orange River. Van Niekerk, on the\r\nalert for news of further discoveries, at once hurried to the spot and\r\npurchased the stone from the boy for five hundred sheep, ten oxen, and\r\na horse, which seemed to the boy untold wealth, but was not a tithe of\r\nthe £11,200 which Lilienfeld Bros., of Hopetown, gave Van Niekerk.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PLATE XV_\r\n\r\nKIMBERLEY MINE, 1871]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PLATE XVI_\r\n\r\nKIMBERLEY MINE, 1872]\r\n\r\nThis remarkable discovery attracted immediate attention to the\r\npotentialities of a country which produced diamonds of such a size, and\r\nprospectors began to swarm into the district, gradually spreading up\r\nthe Vaal River. For some little time not much success was experienced,\r\nbut at length, early in 1870, a rich find was made at Klipdrift,\r\nnow known as Barkly West, which was on the banks of the Vaal River\r\nimmediately opposite the Mission camp at Pniel. The number of miners\r\nsteadily increased until the population on the two sides of the river\r\nincluded altogether some four or five thousand people, and there was\r\nevery appearance of stability in the existing order of things. But a\r\nvast change came over the scene upon the discovery of still richer\r\nmines lying to the south-east and some distance from the river. The\r\nground was actually situated on the route traversed by parties hurrying\r\nto the Vaal River, but no one dreamed of the wealth that lay under\r\ntheir feet. The first discovery was made in August 1870 at the farm\r\nJagersfontein, near Fauresmith in Orange River Colony, by De Klerk,\r\nthe intelligent overseer, who noticed in the dry bed of a stream a\r\nnumber of garnets, and, knowing that they often accompanied diamond,\r\nhad the curiosity to investigate the point. He was immediately\r\nrewarded by finding a fine diamond weighing 50 carats. In the following\r\nmonth diamonds were discovered about twenty miles from Klipdrift\r\nat Dutoitspan on the Dorstfontein farm, and a little later also on\r\nthe contiguous farm of Bultfontein; a diamond was actually found in\r\nthe mortar used in the homestead of the latter farm. Early in May\r\n1871 diamonds were found about two miles away on De Beers’ farm,\r\nVooruitzigt, and two months later, in July, a far richer find was made\r\non the same farm at a spot which was first named Colesberg Kopje, the\r\ninitial band of prospectors having come from the town of that name\r\nnear the Orange River, but was subsequently known as Kimberley after\r\nthe Secretary of State for the Colonies at that time. Soon a large\r\nand prosperous town sprang up close to the mines; it rapidly grew\r\nin size and importance, and to this day remains the centre of the\r\ndiamond-mining industry. Subsequent prospecting proved almost blank\r\nuntil the discovery of the Premier or Wesselton mine on Wesselton\r\nfarm, about four miles from Kimberley, in September 1890; it received\r\nthe former name after Rhodes, who was Premier of Cape Colony at that\r\ndate. No further discovery of any importance was made until, in 1902,\r\ndiamonds were found about twenty miles north-west-north of Pretoria in\r\nthe Transvaal, at the new Premier mine, now famed as the producer of\r\nthe gigantic Cullinan diamond.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PLATE XVII_\r\n\r\nKIMBERLEY MINE, 1874]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PLATE XVIII_\r\n\r\nKIMBERLEY MINE, 1881]\r\n\r\nThe Kimberley mines were at first known as the ‘dry diggings’ on\r\naccount of their arid surroundings in contradistinction to the ‘river\r\ndiggings’ by the Vaal. The dearth of water was at first one of the\r\ngreat difficulties in the way of working the former mines, although\r\nsubsequently the accumulation of underground water at lower levels\r\nproved a great obstacle to the working of the mines. The ‘river\r\ndiggings’ were of a type similar to that met with in India and Brazil,\r\nthe diamonds occurring in a gravelly deposit of limited thickness\r\nbeneath which was barren rock, but the Kimberley mines presented a\r\nphenomenon hitherto without precedent in the whole history of diamond\r\nmining. The diamonds were found in a loose surface deposit, which was\r\neasily worked, and for some time the prospectors thought that the\r\nunderlying limestone corresponded to the bedrock of the river gravel,\r\nuntil at length one more curious than his fellows investigated the\r\nyellowish ground underneath, and found to his surprise that it was even\r\nricher than the surface layer. Immediately a rush was made back to the\r\ndeserted claims, and the mines were busier than ever. This ‘yellow\r\nground,’ as it is popularly called, was much decomposed and easy,\r\ntherefore, to work and sift. About fifty to sixty feet (15-18 m.) below\r\nthe surface, however, it passed into a far harder rock, which from its\r\ncolour is known as the ‘blue ground’; this also, to the unexpected\r\npleasure of the miners, turned out to contain diamonds. Difficulties\r\narose as each claim, 30 by 30 Dutch feet (about 31 English feet or\r\n9·45 metres square) in area, was worked downwards. In the Kimberley\r\nmine (Plate XVI) access to the various claims was secured by retaining\r\nparallel strips, 15 feet wide, each claim being, therefore, reduced\r\nin width to 22½ feet, to form roadways running from side to side of\r\nthe mine in one direction. These, however, soon gave way, not only\r\nbecause of the falling of the earth composing them, but because they\r\nwere undermined and undercut by the owners of the adjacent claims.\r\nBy the end of 1872 the last roadway had disappeared, and the mine\r\npresented the appearance of a vast pit. In order to obtain access to\r\nthe claims without intruding on those lying between, and to provide for\r\nthe hauling of the loads of earth to the surface, an ingenious system\r\nof wire cables in three tiers (Plate XVII) was erected, the lowest\r\ntier being connected to the outermost claims, the second to claims\r\nfarther from the edge, and the highest to claims in the centre of the\r\npit. The mine at that date presented a most remarkable spectacle,\r\nresembling an enormous radiating cobweb, which had a weird charm by\r\nnight as the moonlight softly illuminated it, and by day, owing to\r\nthe perpetual ring of the flanged wheels of the trucks on the running\r\nwires, twanged like some gigantic æolian harp. This system fulfilled\r\nits purpose admirably until, with increasing depth of the workings,\r\nother serious difficulties arose. Deprived of the support of the hard\r\nblue ground, the walls of the mine tended to collapse, and additional\r\ntrouble was caused by the underground water that percolated into the\r\nmine. By the end of 1883 the floor of the Kimberley mine was almost\r\nentirely covered by falls of ‘reef’ (Plate XVIII), as the surrounding\r\nrocks are termed, the depth then being about 400 feet (122 m.). In the\r\nDe Beers mine, in spite of the precaution taken to prevent falls of\r\nreef by cutting the walls of the mine back in terraces, falls occurred\r\ncontinuously in 1884, and by 1887, at a depth of 350 feet (107 m.),\r\nall attempts at open working had to be abandoned. In the Dutoitspan\r\nmine buttresses of blue ground were left, which held back the reef for\r\nsome years, but ultimately the mine became unsafe, and in March 1886 a\r\ndisastrous fall took place, in which eighteen miners—eight white men\r\nand ten Kafirs—lost their lives. The Bultfontein mine was worked to the\r\ngreat depth of 500 feet (152 m.), but falls occurred in 1889 and put\r\nan end to open working. In all cases, therefore, the ultimate end was\r\nthe same: the floor of the mine became covered with a mass of worthless\r\nreef, which rendered mining from above ground dangerous, and, indeed,\r\nimpossible except at prohibitive cost. It was then clearly necessary\r\nto effect access to the diamond-bearing ground by means of shafts sunk\r\nat a sufficient distance from the mine to remove any fear of falls of\r\nreef. For such schemes co-operative working was absolutely essential.\r\nPlate XIX illustrates the desolate character of the Kimberley mine\r\nabove ground and the vastness of the yawning pit, which is over 1000\r\nfeet (300 m.) in depth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PLATE XIX_\r\n\r\nKIMBERLEY MINE AT THE PRESENT DAY]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PLATE XX_\r\n\r\nWESSELTON (_open_) MINE]\r\n\r\nA certain amount of linking up of claims had already taken place, but,\r\nalthough many men must have seen that the complete amalgamation of the\r\ninterests in each mine was imperative, two men alone had the capacity\r\nto bring their ideas to fruition. C. J. Rhodes was the principal agent\r\nin the formation in April 1880 of the De Beers Mining Company, which\r\nrapidly absorbed the remaining claims in the mine, and was re-formed\r\nin 1887 as the De Beers Consolidated Mining Company. Meantime, Barnett\r\nIsaacs, better known by the cognomen Barnato, which had been adopted by\r\nhis\r\n\r\nbrother Henry when engaged in earning his livelihood in the diamond\r\nfields as an entertainer, had secured the major interests in the\r\nKimberley mine. Rhodes saw that, for effective working of the two\r\nmines by any system of underground working, they must be under one\r\nmanagement, but to all suggestions of amalgamation Barnato remained\r\ndeaf, and at last Rhodes determined to secure control of the Kimberley\r\nmine at all costs. The story of the titanic struggle between these\r\ntwo men forms one of the epics of finance. Eventually, when shares\r\nin the Kimberley mine had been boomed to an extraordinary height,\r\nand the price of diamonds had fallen as low as 18s. a carat, Barnato\r\ngave way, and in July 1889 the Kimberley mine was absorbed by the De\r\nBeers Company on payment of the enormous sum of £5,338,650. Shortly\r\nafterwards they undertook the working of the Dutoitspan and the\r\nBultfontein mines, and in January 1896 they acquired the Premier or\r\nWesselton mine. The interests in the Jagersfontein mine were in 1888\r\nunited in the New Jagersfontein Mining and Exploration Company, and\r\nthe mine is now worked also by the De Beers Company. Thus, until the\r\ndevelopment of the new Premier mine in the Transvaal, the De Beers\r\nCompany practically controlled the diamond market. The development\r\nof this last mine was begun so recently, and its size is so vast—the\r\nlongest diameter being half a mile—that open-cut working is likely to\r\ncontinue for some years.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PLATE XXI_\r\n\r\nLOADING THE BLUE GROUND ON THE FLOORS, AND PLOUGHING IT OVER]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PLATE XXII_\r\n\r\nWASHING-MACHINES FOR CONCENTRATING THE BLUE GROUND]\r\n\r\nThough varying slightly in details, the methods of working the mines\r\nare identical in principle. From the steeply inclined shaft horizontal\r\ngalleries are run diagonally right across the mine, the vertical\r\ninterval between successive galleries being 40 feet. From each\r\ngallery side galleries are run at right angles to it and parallel to\r\nthe working face. The blue ground is worked systematically backwards\r\nfrom the working face. The mass is stoped, _i.e._ drilled and broken\r\nfrom the bottom upwards, until only a thin roof is left. As soon as the\r\nsection is worked out and the material removed, the roof is allowed\r\nto fall in, and work is begun on the next section of the same level;\r\nat the same time the first section on the level next below is opened\r\nout. Thus work is simultaneously carried on in several levels, and a\r\nvertical plane would intersect the working faces in a straight line\r\nobliquely inclined to the vertical direction (Fig. 60). When freshly\r\nmined, the blue ground is hard and compact, but it soon disintegrates\r\nunder atmospheric influence. Indeed, the yellow ground itself was\r\nmerely decomposed blue ground. No immediate attempt is made, therefore,\r\nto retrieve the precious stones. The blue ground is spread on to\r\nthe ‘floors’ (Plate XXI), _i.e._ spaces of open veldt which have\r\nbeen cleared of bushes and inequalities, to the depth of a couple of\r\nfeet, and remains there for periods ranging from six months to two\r\nyears, depending on the quality of the blue ground and the amount of\r\nrainfall. To hasten the disintegration the blue ground is frequently\r\nploughed over and occasionally watered, a remarkable introduction of\r\nagricultural methods into mining operations. No elaborate patrolling\r\nor guarding is required, because the diamonds are so sparsely, though\r\nregularly, scattered through the mass that even of the actual workers\r\nin the mines but few have ever seen a stone in the blue ground. When\r\nsufficiently broken up, it is carted to the washing and concentrating\r\nmachines, by means of which the diamonds and the heavier constituents\r\nare separated from the lighter material.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 60.—Vertical Section of Diamond Pipe, showing\r\nTunnels and Stopes.]\r\n\r\nFormerly the diamonds were picked out from the concentrates by means\r\nof the keen eyes of skilled natives; but the process has been vastly\r\nsimplified and the risk of theft entirely eliminated by the remarkable\r\ndiscovery made in 1897 by F. Kirsten, of the De Beers Company, that\r\nof all the heavy constituents of the blue ground diamond alone, with\r\nthe exception of an occasional corundum and zircon, which are easily\r\nsorted out afterwards, adheres to grease more readily than to water.\r\nIn this ingenious machine, the ‘jigger’ or ‘greaser’ (Plate XXIII) as\r\nit is commonly termed, the concentrates are washed over a series of\r\ngalvanized-iron trays, which are covered with a thick coat of grease.\r\nThe trays are slightly inclined downwards, and are kept by machinery\r\nin constant sideways motion backwards and forwards. So accurate is the\r\nworking of this device that few diamonds succeed in getting beyond\r\nthe first tray, and none progress as far as the third, which is added\r\nas an additional precaution. The whole apparatus is securely covered\r\nin so that there is no risk of theft during the operation. The trays\r\nare periodically removed, and the grease is scraped off and boiled to\r\nrelease the diamonds, the grease itself being used over again on the\r\ntrays. This is the first time in the whole course of extraction from\r\nthe mines that the diamonds are actually handled. The stones are now\r\npassed on to the sorters, who separate them into parcels according to\r\ntheir size, shape, and quality.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PLATE XXIII_\r\n\r\nDIAMOND-SORTING MACHINES]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PLATE XXIV_\r\n\r\nKAFIRS PICKING OUT DIAMONDS]\r\n\r\nThe classification at the mines is first into groups by the shape:\r\n(1) close goods, (2) spotted stones, (3) rejection cleavage, (4)\r\nfine cleavage, (5) light brown cleavage, (6) ordinary and rejection\r\ncleavage, (7) flats, (8) macles, (9) rubbish, (10) boart. Close goods\r\nare whole crystals which contain no flaws and can be cut into single\r\nstones. Spotted stones, as their name suggests, contain spots which\r\nnecessitate removal, and cleavage includes stones which are so full of\r\nflaws that they have to be cleaved or split into two or more stones.\r\nFlats are distorted octahedra, and macles are twinned octahedra.\r\nRubbish is material which can be utilized only for grinding purposes,\r\nand boart consists of round dark stones which are invaluable for\r\nrock-drills. These groups are afterwards graded into the following\r\nsubdivisions, depending on increasing depth of yellowish tint: (_a_)\r\nblue-white, (_b_) first Cape, (_c_) second Cape, (_d_) first bye, (_e_)\r\nsecond bye, (_f_) off-colour, (_g_) light yellow, (_h_) yellow. It is,\r\nhowever, only the first group that is so minutely subdivided. After\r\nbeing purchased, the parcels are split up again somewhat differently\r\nfor the London market (cf. p. 136), and the dealers re-arrange the\r\nstones according to the purpose for which they are required. Formerly\r\na syndicate of London merchants took the whole of the produce of the\r\nKimberley mines at a previously arranged price per carat, but at\r\nthe present time the diamonds are sold by certain London firms on\r\ncommission.\r\n\r\nThe products of each mine show differences in either form or colour\r\nwhich enable an expert readily to recognize their origin. The old\r\ndiggings by the Vaal River yielded finer and more colourless stones\r\nthan those found in the dry diggings and the mines underlying them. The\r\nSouth African diamonds, taken as a whole, are always slightly yellowish\r\nor ‘off-coloured’; the mines are, indeed, remarkable for the number of\r\nfine and large, canary-yellow and brown, stones produced. The Kimberley\r\nmine yields a fair percentage of white, and a large number of twinned\r\nand yellow stones. The yield of the De Beers mine comprises mostly\r\ntinted stones—yellow and brown, occasionally silver capes, and very\r\nseldom stones free from colour. The Dutoitspan mine is noted for its\r\nharvest of large yellow diamonds; it also produces fine white cleavage\r\nand small white octahedra. The stones found in the Bultfontein mine are\r\nsmall and spotted, but, on the other hand, the yield has been unusually\r\nregular. The Premier or Wesselton mine yields a large proportion\r\nof flawless octahedra, but, above all, a large number of beautiful\r\ndeep-orange diamonds. Of all the South African mines the Jagersfontein\r\nin the Orange River Colony alone supplies stones of the highly-prized\r\nblue-white colour and steely lustre characteristic of the old Indian\r\nstones. The new Premier mine in the Transvaal is prolific, but mostly\r\nin off-coloured and low-grade stones, the Cullinan diamond being a\r\nremarkable exception.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate the amazing productiveness of the South African mines,\r\nit may be mentioned that, according to Gardner F. Williams, the\r\nKimberley group of mines in sixteen years yielded 36 million carats\r\nof diamonds, and the annual output of the Jagersfontein mine averages\r\nabout a quarter of a million carats, whereas the total output of the\r\nBrazil mines, for the whole of the long period during which they have\r\nbeen worked, barely exceeds 13 million carats. The average yield of the\r\nSouth African mines, however, perceptibly diminishes as the depth of\r\nthe mines increases.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting point connected with the South African diamond\r\nmines, viewed from the scientific standpoint, is the light that they\r\nhave thrown on the question of the origin of the diamond, which\r\npreviously was an incomprehensible and apparently insoluble problem.\r\nIn the older mines, just as at the river diggings by the Vaal, the\r\nstones are found in a gravelly deposit that has resulted from the\r\ndisintegration of the rocks through which the adjacent river has\r\npassed, and it is clear that the diamond cannot have been formed _in\r\nsitu_ here; it had been suspected, and now there is no doubt, that the\r\nitacolumite rock of Brazil has consolidated round the diamonds which\r\nare scattered through it, and that it cannot be the parent rock. The\r\noccurrence at Kimberley is very different. These mines are funnels\r\nwhich go downwards to unknown depths; they are more or less oval in\r\nsection, becoming narrower with increasing depth, and are evidently the\r\nresult of some eruptive agency. The Kimberley mine has been worked to\r\na depth of nearly 4000 feet (1200 m.), and no signs of a termination\r\nhave as yet appeared. The blue ground which fills these ‘pipes,’ as\r\nthey are termed, must have been forced up from below, since it is\r\nsharply differentiated from the surrounding country rocks. This blue\r\nground is a brecciated peridotite of peculiar constitution, to which\r\nthe well-known petrologist, Carvil Lewis, who made a careful study\r\nof it, gave the name kimberlite. The blue colour testifies to its\r\nrichness in iron, and it is to the oxidation of the iron constituent,\r\nthat the change of colour to yellow in the upper levels is due. Owing\r\nto the shafts that have been sunk for working the mines, the nature\r\nof the surrounding rocks is known to some depth. Immediately below\r\nthe surface is a decomposed ferriferous basalt, about 20 to 90 feet\r\n(6-27 m.) thick, next a black slaty shale, 200 to 250 feet (60-75 m.)\r\nthick, then 10 feet (3 m.) of conglomerate, next 400 feet (120 m.)\r\nof olivine diabase, then quartzite, about 400 feet (120 m.) thick,\r\nand lastly a quartz porphyry, which has not yet been penetrated. The\r\nstrata run nearly horizontal, and there are no signs of upward bending\r\nat the pipes. The whole of the country, including the mines, was\r\ncovered with a red sandy soil, and there was nothing to indicate the\r\nwealth that lay underneath. The action of water had in process of time\r\nremoved all signs of eruptive activity. The principal minerals which\r\nare associated with diamond in the blue ground are magnetite, ilmenite,\r\nchromic pyrope, which is put on the market as a gem under the misnomer\r\n‘Cape-ruby,’ ferriferous enstatite, which also is sometimes cut,\r\nolivine more or less decomposed, zircon, kyanite, and mica.\r\n\r\nThe evidence produced by an examination of the blue ground and the\r\nwalls of the pipes proves that the pipes cannot have been volcanoes\r\nsuch as Vesuvius. There is no indication whatever of the action of any\r\nexcessive temperature, while, on the other hand, there is every sign of\r\nthe operation of enormous pressure; the diamonds often contain liquid\r\ndrops of carbonic acid. Crookes puts forward the plausible theory that\r\nsteam has been the primary agency in propelling the diamond and its\r\nassociates up into the channel through which it has carved its way to\r\nfreedom, and holds that molten iron has been the solvent for carbon\r\nwhich has crystallized out as diamond under the enormous pressures\r\nobtaining in remote depths of the earth’s crust. It is pertinent to\r\nnote that, by dissolving carbon in molten iron, the eminent chemist,\r\nMoissan, was enabled to manufacture tiny diamond crystals. Water\r\ntrickling down from above would be immediately converted into steam at\r\nvery high pressure on coming into contact with the molten iron, and, in\r\nits efforts to escape, the steam would drive the iron and its precious\r\ncontents, together with the adjacent rocks, upwards to the surface. The\r\nferriferous nature of the blue ground and the yellow tinge so common\r\nto the diamonds lend confirmation to this theory. The process by which\r\nthe carbon was extracted from shales or other carboniferous rocks and\r\ndissolved in iron still awaits elucidation.\r\n\r\nDiamonds were found in New South Wales as long ago as 1851 on Turon\r\nRiver and at Reedy Creek, near Bathurst, about ninety miles (145 km.)\r\nfrom Sydney, but the find was of little commercial importance. A more\r\nextensive deposit came to light in 1867 farther north at Mudgee. In\r\n1872 diamonds were discovered in the extreme north of the State, at\r\nBingara near the Queensland border. Another discovery was made in 1884\r\nat Tingha, and still more recently in the tin gravels of Inverell in\r\nthe same region. In their freedom from colour and absence of twinning\r\nthe New South Wales diamonds resemble the Brazilian stones. The average\r\nsize is small, running about five to the carat when cut; the largest\r\nfound weighed nearly 6 carats when cut. They are remarkable for their\r\nexcessive hardness; they can be cut only with their own dust, ordinary\r\ndiamond dust making no impression.\r\n\r\nThe Borneo diamonds are likewise distinguished by their exceptional\r\nhardness. They mostly occur by the river Landak, near Pontianak on the\r\nwest coast of the island. They are found in a layer of rather coarse\r\ngravel, variable, but rarely exceeding a yard (1 m.), in depth, and are\r\nassociated with corundum and rutile, together with the precious metals\r\ngold and platinum. Indeed, it is no uncommon sight to see natives\r\nwearing waistcoats ornamented with gold buttons, in each of which a\r\ndiamond is set. The diamonds are well crystallized and generally of\r\npure water; yellowish and canary-yellow stones are also common, but\r\nrose-red, bluish, smoky, and black stones are rare. They seldom exceed\r\na carat in weight; but stones of 10 carats in weight are found, and\r\noccasionally they attain to 20 carats. In 1850 a diamond weighing 77\r\ncarats was discovered. The Rajah of Mattan is said to possess one of\r\nthe purest water weighing as much as 367 carats, but no one qualified\r\nto pronounce an opinion regarding its genuineness has ever seen it.\r\n\r\nIn Rhodesia small diamonds have been found in gravel beds resting on\r\ndecomposed granite near the Somabula forest, about 12 miles (19 km.)\r\nwest of Gwelo, in association with chrysoberyl in abundance, blue\r\ntopaz, kyanite, ruby, sapphire, tourmaline, and garnet.\r\n\r\nThe occurrence of diamond in German South-West Africa is very peculiar.\r\nLarge numbers of small stones are found close to the shore near\r\nLuderitz Bay in a gravelly surface layer, which is nowhere more than a\r\nfoot in depth. They are picked by hand by natives and washed in sieves.\r\nIn shape they are generally six-faced octahedra or twinned octahedra,\r\nsimple octahedra being rare, and in size they run about four or five\r\nto the carat, the largest stone as yet found being only 2 carats in\r\nweight. Their colour is usually yellowish.\r\n\r\nSeveral isolated finds of diamonds have been reported in California\r\nand other parts of the United States, but none have proved of any\r\nimportance. The largest stone found weighed 23¾ carats uncut; it was\r\ndiscovered at Manchester in Virginia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\n                          HISTORICAL DIAMONDS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe number of diamonds which exceed a hundred carats in weight when\r\ncut is very limited. Their extreme costliness renders them something\r\nmore than mere ornaments; in a condensed and portable form they\r\nrepresent great wealth and all the potentiality for good or ill thereby\r\nentailed, and have played no small, if sinister, rôle in the moulding\r\nof history. In bygone days when despotic government was universal, the\r\npossession of a splendid jewel in weak hands but too often precipitated\r\nthe aggression of a greedy and powerful neighbour, and plunged whole\r\ncountries into the horrors of a ruthless and bloody war. In more\r\ncivilized days a great diamond has often been pledged as security for\r\nmoney to replenish an empty treasury in times of stress. The ambitions\r\nof Napoleon might have received a set-back but for the funds raised\r\non the security of the famous Pitt diamond. The history of such\r\nstones—often one long romance—is full of interest, but space will not\r\npermit of more than a brief sketch here.\r\n\r\nIf we except the colossal Cullinan stone, the mines of Brazil and South\r\nAfrica cannot compare with the old mines of India as the birthplace of\r\nlarge and perfect diamonds of world-wide fame.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             (1) KOH-I-NOR\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 61.—Koh-i-nor (top view).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 62.—Koh-i-nor (side view).]\r\n\r\nThe history of the famous stone called the Koh-i-nor, meaning Mound of\r\nLight, is known as far back as the year 1304, when it fell into the\r\nhands of the Mogul emperors, and legend even traces it back some four\r\nthousand years previously. It remained at Delhi until the invasion of\r\nNorth-West India by Nadir Shah in 1739, when it passed together with an\r\nimmense amount of spoil into the hands of the conqueror. At his death\r\nthe empire which he had so strenuously founded fell to pieces, and\r\nthe great diamond after many vicissitudes came into the possession of\r\nRunjit Singh at Lahore. His successors kept it until upon the fall of\r\nthe Sikh power in 1850 it passed to the East India Company, in whose\r\nname it was presented by Lord Dalhousie to Queen Victoria. At this\r\ndate the stone still retained its original Indian form, but in 1862 it\r\nwas re-cut into the form of a shallow brilliant (Fig. 62), the weight\r\nthereby being reduced from 186-1/16 to 106-1/16 carats. The wisdom\r\nof this course has been severely criticized; the stone has not the\r\ncorrect shape of a brilliant and is deficient in ‘fire,’ and it has\r\nwith the change in shape lost much of its old historical interest.\r\nThe Koh-i-nor is the private property of the English Royal Family, the\r\nstone shown in the Tower being a model. It is valued at £100,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          (2) PITT OR REGENT\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 63.—Pitt or Regent (top view).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 64.—Pitt or Regent (side view).]\r\n\r\nThis splendid stone was discovered in 1701 at the famous diamond mines\r\nat Partial, on the Kistna, about 150 miles (240 km.) from Golconda,\r\nand weighed as much as 410 carats in the rough. By devious ways it\r\ncame into the hands of Jamchund, a Parsee merchant, from whom it was\r\npurchased by William Pitt, governor of Fort St. George, Madras, for\r\n£20,400. On his return to England Pitt had it cut into a perfect\r\nbrilliant (Fig. 63), weighing 163⅞ carats, the operation occupying\r\nthe space of two years and costing £5000; more than £7000 is said to\r\nhave been realized from the sale of the fragments left over. Pitt\r\nhad an uneasy time and lived in constant dread of theft of the stone\r\nuntil, in 1717, after lengthy negotiations, he parted with it to the\r\nDuc d’Orléans, Regent of France, for the immense sum of three and\r\nthree-quarter million francs, about £135,000. With the remainder of the\r\nFrench regalia it was stolen from the Garde-meuble on August 17, 1792,\r\nin the early days of the French Revolution, but was eventually restored\r\nby the thieves, doubtless because of the impossibility of disposing of\r\nsuch a stone, at least intact, and it is now exhibited in the Apollo\r\nGallery of the Louvre at Paris. It measures about 30 millimetres in\r\nlength, 25 in width, and 19 in depth, and is valued at £480,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              (3) ORLOFF\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 65.—Orloff (top view).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 66.—Orloff (side view).]\r\n\r\nOne of the finest diamonds existing, this large stone forms the top\r\nof the imperial sceptre of Russia. It is rose-cut (Fig. 65), the base\r\nbeing a cleavage face, and weighs 194¾ carats. It is said to have\r\nformed at one time one of the eyes of a statue of Brahma which stood\r\nin a temple on the island of Sheringham in the Cavery River, near\r\nTrichinopoli, in Mysore, and to have been stolen by a French soldier\r\nwho had somehow persuaded the priests to appoint him guardian of the\r\ntemple. He sold it for £2000 to the captain of an English ship, who\r\ndisposed of it to a Jewish dealer in London for £12,000. It changed\r\nhands to a Persian merchant, Raphael Khojeh, who eventually sold it to\r\nPrince Orloff for, so it is said, the immense sum of £90,000 and an\r\nannuity of £4000. It was presented by Prince Orloff to Catherine II of\r\nRussia.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            (4) GREAT MOGUL\r\n\r\nThis, the largest Indian diamond known, was found in the Kollur mines,\r\nabout the year 1650. Its original weight is said to have been 787½\r\ncarats, but it was so full of flaws that the Venetian, Hortensio\r\nBorgis, then in India, in cutting it to a rose form reduced its weight\r\nto 240 carats. It was seen by Tavernier at the time of his visit\r\nto India, but it has since been quite lost sight of. It has been\r\nidentified with both the Koh-i-nor and the Orloff, and it is even\r\nsuggested that both these stones were cut from it.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               (5) SANCY\r\n\r\nThe history of this diamond is very involved, and probably two or more\r\nstones have been confused. It may have been the one cut by Berquem for\r\nCharles the Bold, from whose body on the fatal day of Nancy, in 1477,\r\nit was snatched by a marauding soldier. It was acquired by Nicholas\r\nHarlai, Seigneur de Sancy, who sold it to Queen Elizabeth at the close\r\nof the sixteenth century. A hundred years later, in 1695, it was sold\r\nby James II to Louis XIV. The stone in the French regalia, according\r\nto the inventory taken in 1791, weighed 53¾ carats. It was never\r\nrecovered after the theft of the regalia in the following year, but\r\nmay be identical with the diamond which was in the possession of the\r\nDemidoff family and was sold by Prince Demidoff in 1865 to a London\r\nfirm who were said to have been acting for Sir Jamsetjee Jeejeebhoy, a\r\nwealthy Parsee of Bombay. It was shown at the Paris Exhibition of 1867.\r\nIt was almond-shaped, and covered all over with tiny facets by Indian\r\nlapidaries.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            (6) GREAT TABLE\r\n\r\nThis mysterious stone was seen by Tavernier at Golconda in 1642, but\r\nhas quite disappeared. It weighed 242-3/16 carats.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       (7) MOON OF THE MOUNTAINS\r\n\r\nThis diamond is often confused with the Orloff. It was captured by\r\nNadir Shah at Delhi, and after his murder was stolen by an Afghan\r\nsoldier who disposed of it to an Armenian, by name Shaffrass. It was\r\nfinally acquired by the Russian crown for an enormous sum.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               (8) NIZAM\r\n\r\nA large diamond, weighing 340 carats, belonged to the Nizam of\r\nHyderabad; it was fractured at the beginning of the Indian Mutiny.\r\nWhether the weight is that previous to fracture or not, there seems to\r\nbe no information.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            (9) DARYA-I-NOR\r\n\r\nThis fine diamond, rose-cut and 186 carats in weight, is of the purest\r\nwater and merits its title of ‘River of Light.’ It seems to have been\r\ncaptured by Nadir Shah at Delhi, and is now the largest diamond in the\r\nPersian collection.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               (10) SHAH\r\n\r\nThis fine stone, of the purest water, was presented to the Czar\r\nNicholas by the Persian prince Chosroes, younger son of Abbas Mirza, in\r\n1843. At that time it still retained three cleavage faces which were\r\nengraved with the names of three Persian sovereigns, and weighed 95\r\ncarats. It was, however, subsequently re-cut with the loss of 9 carats,\r\nand the engraving has disappeared in the process.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  (11) AKBAR SHAH, OR JEHAN GHIR SHAH\r\n\r\nOnce the property of the great Mogul, Akbar, this diamond was engraved\r\non two faces with Arabic inscriptions by the instructions of his\r\nsuccessor, Jehan. It disappeared, but turned up again in Turkey\r\nunder the name of ‘Shepherd’s Stone’; it still retained its original\r\ninscriptions and was thereby recognized. In 1866 it was re-cut, the\r\nweight being reduced from 116 to 71 carats, and the inscriptions\r\ndestroyed. The stone was sold to the Gaekwar of Baroda for 3½ lakhs of\r\nrupees (about £23,333).\r\n\r\n\r\n                            (12) POLAR STAR\r\n\r\nA beautiful, brilliant-cut stone, weighing 40 carats, which is known by\r\nthis name, is in the Russian regalia.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              (13) NASSAK\r\n\r\nThe Nassak diamond, which weighed 89¾ carats, formed part of the\r\nDeccan booty, and was put up to auction in London in July 1837. It\r\nwas purchased by Emanuel, a London jeweller, who for £7200 shortly\r\nafterwards sold it to the Duke of Westminster, in whose family it still\r\nremains. It was originally pear-shaped, but was re-cut to a triangular\r\nform with a reduction in weight to 78⅝ carats.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             (14) NAPOLEON\r\n\r\nThis diamond was purchased by Napoleon Buonaparte for £8000, and worn\r\nby him at his wedding with Josephine Beauharnais in 1796.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            (15) CUMBERLAND\r\n\r\nThis stone, which weighs 32 carats, was purchased by the city of London\r\nfor £10,000 and presented to the Duke of Cumberland after the battle of\r\nCulloden; it is now in the possession of the Duke of Brunswick.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              (16) PIGOTT\r\n\r\nA fine Indian stone, weighing 47½ carats, this diamond was brought\r\nto England by Lord Pigott in 1775 and sold for £30,000. It came into\r\nthe possession of Ali Pacha, Viceroy of Egypt, and was by his orders\r\ndestroyed at his death.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             (17) EUGÉNIE\r\n\r\nThis fine stone, weighing 51 carats, was given by the Czarina Catherine\r\nII of Russia to her favourite, Potemkin. It was purchased by Napoleon\r\nIII as a bridal gift for his bride, and on his downfall was bought by\r\nthe Gaekwar of Baroda.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           (18) WHITE SAXON\r\n\r\nSquare in contour, measuring 1-1/12 in. (28 mm.), and weighing 48¾\r\ncarats, this stone was purchased by Augustus the Strong for a million\r\nthalers (about £150,000).\r\n\r\n\r\n                          (19) PACHA OF EGYPT\r\n\r\nThis 40-carat brilliant was purchased by Ibrahim, Viceroy of Egypt, for\r\n£28,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           (20) STAR OF ESTE\r\n\r\nThough a comparatively small stone, in weight 25½ carats, it is noted\r\nfor its perfection of form and quality. It belongs to the Archduke\r\nFranz Ferdinand of Austrian-Este, eldest son of the Archduke Karl\r\nLudwig.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   (21) TUSCANY, OR AUSTRIAN YELLOW\r\n\r\nThe beauty of this large stone, 133¾ carats in weight, is marred by\r\nthe tinge of yellow, which is sufficiently pronounced to impair its\r\nbrilliancy; it is a double rose in form. At one time the property of\r\nthe Grand Dukes of Tuscany, it is now in the possession of the Emperor\r\nof Austria. King mentions a tale that it was bought at a curiosity\r\nstall in Florence for an insignificant sum, the stone being supposed to\r\nbe only yellow quartz.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        (22) STAR OF THE SOUTH\r\n\r\nThis, the largest of the Brazilian diamonds, was discovered at the\r\nmines of Bagagem in July 1853. Perfectly transparent and without tint,\r\nit was dodecahedral in shape and weighed 254½ carats, and was sold in\r\nthe rough for £40,000. It was cut as a perfect brilliant, being reduced\r\nin weight to 125½ carats.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         (23) ENGLISH DRESDEN\r\n\r\nThis beautiful stone, which weighed 119½ carats in the rough, was found\r\nat the Bagagem mines, in Brazil, in 1857, and came into the possession\r\nof Mr. E. Dresden. It was cut as a long, egg-shaped brilliant, weighing\r\n76½ carats.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       (24) STAR OF SOUTH AFRICA\r\n\r\nThe first considerable stone to be found in South Africa, it was\r\ndiscovered at the Vaal River diggings in 1869, and weighed 83½ carats\r\nin the rough. It was cut to a triangular brilliant of 46½ carats. It\r\nwas finally purchased by the Countess of Dudley for £25,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             (25) STEWART\r\n\r\nThis large diamond, weighing in the rough 288⅜ carats, was found at the\r\nVaal River diggings in 1872, and was first sold for £6000 and shortly\r\nafterwards for £9000; it was reduced on cutting to 120 carats. Like\r\nmany South African stones, it has a faint yellowish tinge.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          (26) PORTER-RHODES\r\n\r\nThis blue-white stone, which weighed 150 carats, was found in a claim\r\nbelonging to Mr. Porter-Rhodes in the Kimberley mine in February 1880.\r\n\r\n\r\n                (27) IMPERIAL, VICTORIA, OR GREAT WHITE\r\n\r\nThis large diamond weighed as much as 457 carats in the rough, and 180\r\nwhen cut; it is quite colourless. It was brought to Europe in 1884, and\r\nwas eventually sold to the Nizam of Hyderabad for £20,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             (28) DE BEERS\r\n\r\nA pale yellowish stone, weighing 428½ carats, was found in the De Beers\r\nmine in 1888. It was cut to a brilliant weighing 228½ carats, and\r\nwas sold to an Indian prince. A still larger stone of similar tinge,\r\nweighing 503¼ carats, was discovered in 1896, and among other large\r\nstones supplied by the same mine may be mentioned one of 302 carats\r\nfound in 1884, and another of 409 carats found in early years.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            (29) EXCELSIOR\r\n\r\nThis, which prior to the discovery of the ‘Cullinan,’ was by far the\r\nlargest South African stone, was found in the Jagersfontein mine on\r\nJune 30, 1893; bluish-white in tint, it weighed 969½ carats. From\r\nit were cut twenty-one brilliants, the larger stones weighing 67⅞,\r\n45-13/16, 45-11/16, 39-3/16, 34, 27⅞, 25⅝, 23-11/16, 16-11/32, 13½\r\ncarats respectively, and the total weight of the cut stones amounting\r\nto 364-3/32 carats.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             (30) JUBILEE\r\n\r\nAnother large stone was discovered in the Jagersfontein mine in\r\n1895. It weighed 634 carats in the rough, and from it was obtained a\r\nsplendid, faultless brilliant weighing 239 carats. It was shown at the\r\nParis Exhibition of 1900.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   (31) STAR OF AFRICA, OR CULLINAN\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 67.—Cullinan No. 1.]\r\n\r\nAll diamonds pale into insignificance when compared with the colossal\r\nstone that came to light at the Premier mine near Pretoria in the\r\nTransvaal on January 25, 1905. It was first called the ‘Cullinan’ after\r\nSir T. M. Cullinan, chairman of the Premier Diamond Mine (Transvaal)\r\nCompany, but has recently, by desire of King George V, received the\r\nname ‘Star of Africa.’ The rough stone weighed 621·2 grams or 3025¾\r\ncarats (about 1⅓ lb.); it displayed three natural faces (Plate XXV)\r\nand one large cleavage face, and its shape suggested that it was\r\na portion of an enormous stone more than double its size; it was\r\ntransparent, colourless, and had only one small flaw near the surface.\r\nThis magnificent diamond was purchased by the Transvaal Government for\r\n£150,000, and presented to King Edward VII on his birthday, November 9,\r\n1907.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PLATE XXV_\r\n\r\nCULLINAN DIAMOND\r\n\r\n(_Natural size_)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 68.—Cullinan No. 2.]\r\n\r\nThe Cullinan was entrusted to the famous firm, Messrs. I. J. Asscher\r\n& Co., of Amsterdam, for cutting on January 23, 1908, just three\r\nyears after its discovery. On February 10 it was cleaved into two\r\nparts, weighing respectively 1977½ and 1040½ carats, from which the\r\ntwo largest stones have been cut, one being a pendeloque or drop\r\nbrilliant in shape (Fig. 67) and weighing 516½ carats, and the other\r\na square brilliant (Fig. 68) weighing 309-3/16 carats. The first\r\nhas been placed in the sceptre, and the second in the crown of the\r\nregalia. Besides these there are a pendeloque weighing 92 carats, a\r\nsquare-shaped brilliant 62, a heart-shaped stone 18⅜, two marquises\r\n8-9/16 and 11¼, an oblong stone 6⅝, a pendeloque 4-9/32, and 96 small\r\nbrilliants weighing together 7⅜; the total weight of the cut stones\r\namounts to 1036-5/32 carats. The largest stone has 74 and the second 66\r\nfacets. The work was completed and the stones handed to King Edward in\r\nNovember 1908.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Premier mine has yielded no worthy compeer of the\r\nCullinan, it can, nevertheless, boast of a considerable number of\r\nlarge stones which but for comparison with that giant would be thought\r\nremarkable for their size, no fewer than seven of them having weights\r\nof over 300 carats, viz. 511, 487¼, 458¾, 391½, 373, 348, and 334\r\ncarats.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          (32) STAR OF MINAS\r\n\r\nThis large diamond, which was found in 1911 at the Bagagem mines, Minas\r\nGeraes, Brazil, had the shape of a dome with a flat base, and weighed\r\nin the rough 35·875 grams (174¾ carats).\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n\r\nThe large stone called the ‘Braganza,’ in the Portuguese regalia, which\r\nis supposed to be a diamond, is probably a white topaz; it weighs 1680\r\ncarats. The Mattan stone, pear-shaped and weighing 367 carats, which\r\nwas found in the Landak mines near the west coast of Borneo in 1787, is\r\nsuspected to be quartz.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           COLOURED DIAMONDS\r\n\r\n\r\n                               (1) HOPE\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 69.—Hope.]\r\n\r\nThe largest of coloured diamonds, the Hope, weighs 44⅛ carats, and has\r\na steely- or greenish-blue, and not the royal-blue colour of the glass\r\nmodels supposed to represent it. It is believed to be a portion of a\r\ndrop-form stone (_d’un beau violet_) which was said to have been found\r\nat the Kollur mines, and was secured by Tavernier in India in 1642 and\r\nsold by him to Louis XIV in 1668; it then weighed 67 carats. This stone\r\nwas stolen with the remainder of the French regalia in 1792 and never\r\nrecovered. In 1830 the present stone (Fig. 69) was offered for sale\r\nby Eliason, a London dealer, and was purchased for £18,000 by Thomas\r\nPhilip Hope, a wealthy banker and a keen collector of gems. Probably\r\nthe apex of the original stone had been cut off, reducing it to a\r\nnearly square stone. The slight want of symmetry of the present stone\r\nlends confirmation to this view, and two other blue stones are known,\r\nwhich, together with the Hope, make up the weight of the original\r\nstone. At the sale of the Hope collection at Christie’s in 1867 the\r\nblue diamond went to America. In 1908 the owner disposed of it to Habib\r\nBey for the enormous sum of £80,000. It was put up to auction in Paris\r\nin 1909, and bought by Rosenau, the Paris diamond merchant, for the\r\ncomparatively small sum of 400,000 francs (about £16,000), and was sold\r\nin January 1911 to Mr. Edward M’Lean for £60,000. The stone is supposed\r\nto bring ill-luck in its train, and its history has been liberally\r\nembellished with fable to establish the saying.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              (2) DRESDEN\r\n\r\nA beautiful apple-green diamond, faultless, and of the purest water, is\r\ncontained in the famous Green Vaults of Dresden. It weighs 40 carats,\r\nand was purchased by Augustus the Strong in 1743 for 60,000 thalers\r\n(about £9000).\r\n\r\n\r\n                              (3) PAUL I\r\n\r\nA fine ruby-red diamond, weighing 10 carats, is included among the\r\nRussian crown jewels.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              (4) TIFFANY\r\n\r\nThe lovely orange brilliant, weighing 125⅜ carats, which is in the\r\npossession of Messrs. Tiffany & Co., the well-known jewellers of New\r\nYork, was discovered in the Kimberley mine in 1878.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\n                               CORUNDUM\r\n\r\n                         (_Sapphire_, _Ruby_)\r\n\r\n\r\nRanking in hardness second to diamond alone, the species known to\r\nscience as corundum and widely familiar by the names of its varieties,\r\nsapphire and ruby, holds a pre-eminent position among coloured\r\ngem-stones. The barbaric splendour of ruby (Plate I, Fig. 13) and the\r\nglorious hue of sapphire (Plate I, Fig. 11) are unsurpassed, and it\r\nis remarkable that the same species should boast such different, but\r\nequally magnificent, tints. They, however, by no means exhaust the\r\nresources of this variegated species. Fine yellow stones (Plate I,\r\nFig. 12), which compare with topaz in colour and are its superior in\r\nhardness, and brilliant colourless stones, which are unfortunately\r\ndeficient in ‘fire’ and cannot therefore approach diamond, are to\r\nbe met with, besides others of less attractive hues, purple, and\r\nyellowish, bluish, and other shades of green. Want of homogeneity in\r\nthe coloration of corundum is a frequent phenomenon; thus, the purple\r\nstones on close examination are found to be composed of alternate blue\r\nand red layers, and stones showing patches of yellow and blue colour\r\nare common. Owing to the peculiarity of their interior arrangement\r\ncertain stones display when cut _en cabochon_ a vivid six-rayed star of\r\nlight (Plate I, Fig. 15). Sapphire and ruby share with diamond, pearl,\r\nand emerald the first rank in jewellery. They are popular stones,\r\nespecially in rings; their comparative rarity in large sizes, apart\r\nfrom the question of expense, prevents their use in the bigger articles\r\nof jewellery. The front of the stones is usually brilliant-cut and the\r\nback step-cut, but Indian lapidaries often prefer to cover the stone\r\nwith a large number of triangular facets, especially if the stone be\r\nflawed; star-stones are cut more or less steeply _en cabochon_.\r\n\r\nIn composition corundum is alumina, oxide of aluminium, corresponding\r\nto the formula Al_{2}O_{3}, but it usually contains in addition small\r\nquantities, rarely more than 1 per cent., of ferric oxide, chromic\r\noxide, and perhaps other metallic oxides. When pure, it is colourless;\r\nthe splendid tints which are its glory have their origin in the minute\r\ntraces of the other oxides present. No doubt chromic oxide is the\r\ncause of the ruddy hue of ruby, since it is possible, as explained\r\nabove (p. 117), closely to imitate the ruby tint by this means, but\r\nnothing approaching so large a percentage as 2½ has been detected in\r\na natural stone. The blue colour of sapphire may be due to titanic\r\noxide, and ferric oxide may be responsible for the yellow hue of\r\nthe ‘oriental topaz,’ as the yellow corundum is termed. Sapphires,\r\nwhen of considerable size, are rarely uniform in tint throughout the\r\nstone. Alternations of blue and red zones, giving rise to an apparent\r\npurple or violet tint, and the conjunction of patches of blue and\r\nyellow are common. Perfectly colourless stones are less common, a\r\nslight bluish tinge being usually noticeable, but they are not in much\r\ndemand because, on account of their lack of ‘fire,’ they are of little\r\ninterest when cut. The tint of the red stones varies considerably in\r\ndepth; jewellers term them, when pale, pink sapphires, but, of course,\r\nno sharp distinction can be drawn between them and rubies. The most\r\nhighly prized tint is the so-called pigeon’s blood, a shade of red\r\nslightly inclined to purple. The prices for ruby of good colour run\r\nfrom about 25s. a carat for small stones to between £60 and £80 a\r\ncarat for large stones, and still higher for exceptional rubies. The\r\ntaste in sapphires has changed of recent times. Formerly the deep blue\r\nwas most in demand, but now the lighter shade, that resembling the\r\ncolour of corn-flower, is preferred, because it retains a good colour\r\nin artificial light. Large sapphires are more plentiful than large\r\nrubies, and prices run lower; even for large perfect stones the rate\r\ndoes not exceed £30 a carat. Large and uniform ‘oriental topazes’ are\r\ncomparatively common, and realize moderate prices, about 2s. to 30s.\r\na carat according to quality and size. Green sapphires are abundant\r\nfrom Australia, but their tint, a kind of deep sage-green, is not very\r\npleasing. Brown stones with a silkiness of structure are also known.\r\n\r\nThe name of the species comes through the French _corindon_ from an\r\nold Hindu word, _korund_, of unknown significance, and arose from the\r\ncircumstance that the stones which first found their way to Europe came\r\nfrom India. At the present day the word corundum is applied in commerce\r\nto the opaque stones used for abrasive purposes, to distinguish the\r\npurer material from emery, which is corundum mixed with magnetite and\r\nother heavy stones of lower hardness. The origin of the word sapphire,\r\nwhich means blue, has been discussed in an earlier chapter (p. 110).\r\nJewellers use it in a general sense for all corundum except ruby. Ruby\r\ncomes from the Latin _ruber_, red. The prefix ‘oriental’ (p. 111)\r\nis often used to distinguish varieties of corundum, since it is the\r\nhardest of ordinary coloured stones and the finest gem-stones in early\r\ndays reached Europe by way of the East.\r\n\r\nCorundum crystallizes either in six-sided prisms terminated by flat\r\nfaces (Plate I, Fig. 10), which are often triangularly marked, or with\r\ntwelve inclined faces, six above and six below, meeting in a girdle\r\n(Plate I, Fig. 14). Ruby favours the former and the other varieties\r\nthe latter type. A fine crystal of ruby—the ‘Edwardes,’ so named by\r\nthe donor, John Ruskin, after Sir Herbert Edwardes—which weighs 33·5\r\ngrams (163 carats), is exhibited in the Mineral Gallery of the British\r\nMuseum (Natural History), and is tilted in such a way that the light\r\nfrom a neighbouring window falls on the large basal face, and reveals\r\nthe interesting markings that nature has engraved on it. From its type\r\nof symmetry corundum is doubly refractive with a direction of single\r\nrefraction running parallel to the edge of the prism. Owing to the\r\nrelative purity of the chemical composition the refractive indices\r\nare very constant; the ordinary index ranges from 1·766 to 1·774 and\r\nthe extraordinary index from 1·757 to 1·765, the double refraction\r\nremaining always the same, 0·009. The amount of colour-dispersion is\r\nsmall, and therefore colourless corundum displays very little ‘fire.’\r\nThe difference between the indices for red and blue light is, however,\r\nsufficiently great that the base of a ruby may be left relatively\r\nthicker than that of a sapphire to secure an equally satisfactory\r\neffect (cf. p. 98)—a point of some importance to the lapidary, since\r\nstones are sold by weight and it is his object to keep the weight as\r\ngreat as possible. When a corundum is tested on the refractometer in\r\nwhite light a wide spectrum deliminates the two portions of the field\r\nbecause of the smallness of the colour-dispersion (cf p. 25). The\r\ndichroism of both ruby and sapphire is marked, the twin colours given\r\nby the former being red and purplish-red, and by the latter blue and\r\nyellowish-blue, the second colour in each instance corresponding to\r\nthe extraordinary ray. Tests with the dichroscope easily separate ruby\r\nand sapphire from any other red or blue stone. This character has an\r\nimportant bearing on the proper mode of cutting the stones. The ugly\r\nyellowish tint given by the extraordinary ray of sapphire should be\r\navoided by cutting the stone with its table-facet at right angles to\r\nthe prism edge, which is the direction of single refraction. Whether\r\na ruby should be treated in the same way is a moot point. No doubt\r\nif the colour is deep, it is the best plan, because the amount of\r\nabsorption of light is thereby sensibly reduced, but otherwise the\r\ndelightful nuances distinguishing ruby are best secured by cutting\r\nthe table-facet parallel to the direction of single refraction.\r\nYellow corundum also shows distinct dichroism, but by a variation\r\nmore of the depth than of the tint of the colour; the phenomenon is\r\nfaint compared with the dichroic effect of a yellow chrysoberyl. The\r\nspecific gravity also is very constant, varying only from 3·95 to 4·10;\r\nsapphire is on the whole lighter than ruby. Corundum has the symbol 9\r\non Mohs’s scale, but though coming next to diamond it is a very poor\r\nsecond (cf. p. 79). As is usually the case, the application of heat\r\ntends to lighten the colour of the stones: those of a pale violet or\r\na yellow colour lose the tint entirely, and the deep violet stones\r\nturn a lovely rose colour. On the other hand the action of radium has,\r\nas was shown by Bordas, an intensifying action on the colour, and\r\neven develops it in a colourless stone. From the latter reaction it\r\nmay be inferred that often in an apparently colourless stone two or\r\nmore selective influences are at work which ordinarily neutralize one\r\nanother, but, being unequally stimulated by the action of radium, they\r\nthereupon give rise to colour. The stellate appearance of asterias\r\nor star-stones—star-ruby and star-sapphire—results from the regular\r\narrangement either of numerous small channels or of twin-lamellæ in the\r\nstone parallel to the six sides of the prisms; light is reflected from\r\nthe interior in the form of a six-rayed star (p. 38). Some stones from\r\nSiam possess a markedly fibrous or silky structure.\r\n\r\nThe synthetical manufacture of ruby, sapphire, and other varieties of\r\ncorundum has already been described (p. 116).\r\n\r\nBesides its use in jewellery corundum is on account of its hardness of\r\ngreat service for many other purposes. Small fragments are extensively\r\nemployed for the bearing parts of the movements of watches, and both\r\nthe opaque corundum and the impure kind known as emery are in general\r\nuse for grinding and polishing softer stones, and steel and other\r\nmetal-work.\r\n\r\nThe world’s supply of fine rubies is drawn almost entirely from the\r\nfamous ruby mines near Mogok, situated about 90 miles (145 km.) in\r\na north-easterly direction from Mandalay in Upper Burma and at an\r\nelevation of about 4000 ft. (1200 m.) above sea-level. It is from this\r\ndistrict that the stones of the coveted carmine-red, the so-called\r\n‘pigeon’s blood,’ colour are obtained. The ruby occurs in a granular\r\nlimestone or calcite in association with the spinel of nearly the\r\nsame appearance—the ‘balas-ruby,’ oriental topaz (yellow corundum),\r\ntourmaline, and occasionally sapphire. Some stones are found in\r\nthe limestone on the sides of the hills, but by far the largest\r\nquantity occur in the alluvial deposits, both gravel and clay, in the\r\nriver-beds; the ruby ground is locally known as ‘_byon_.’ The stones\r\nare as a rule quite small, averaging only about four to the carat.\r\nBefore the British annexation of the country in 1885 the mines were a\r\nmonopoly of the Burmese sovereigns and were worked solely under royal\r\nlicence. They are known to be of great antiquity, but otherwise their\r\nearly history is a mystery. It is said that an astute king secured the\r\npriceless territory in 1597 from the neighbouring Chinese Shans in\r\nexchange for a small and unimportant town on the Irrawaddy; if that\r\nbe so, he struck an excellent bargain. The mines were allotted to\r\nlicensed miners, _twin-tsas_ (eaters of the mine) as they were called\r\nin the language of the country, who not only paid for the privilege,\r\nbut were compelled to hand over to the king all stones above a certain\r\nweight. As might be anticipated this injunction caused considerable\r\ntrouble, and the royal monopolists constantly suspected the miners of\r\nevading the regulation by breaking up stones of exceptional size; from\r\nsubsequent experience, it is probable that large stones were in reality\r\nseldom found. Since 1887 the mines have been worked by arrangement with\r\nthe Government of India by the Ruby Mines, Ltd., an English company.\r\nIts career has been far from prosperous, but during recent years, in\r\nconsequence of the improved methods of working the mines and of the\r\nmore generous terms afterwards accorded by the Government, greater\r\nsuccess has been experienced; the future is, however, to some extent\r\nclouded by the advent of the synthetical stone, which has even made its\r\nway out to the East.\r\n\r\nLarge rubies are far from common, and such as were discovered in the\r\nold days were jealously hoarded by the Burmese sovereigns. According to\r\nStreeter the finest that ever came to Europe were a pair brought over\r\nin 1875, at a time when the Burmese king was pressed for money. One,\r\nrich in colour, was originally cushion-shaped and weighed 37 carats;\r\nthe other was a blunt drop in form and weighed 47 carats. Both were cut\r\nin London, the former being reduced to 32-5/16 carats and the latter\r\nto 38-9/16 carats, and were sold for £10,000 and £20,000 respectively.\r\nA colossal stone, weighing 400 carats, is reported to have been found\r\nin Burma; it was broken into three pieces, of which two were cut and\r\nresulted in stones weighing 70 and 45 carats respectively, and the\r\nthird was sold uncut in Calcutta for 7 lakhs of rupees (£46,667). The\r\nfinder of another large stone broke it into two parts, which after\r\ncutting weighed 98 and 74 carats respectively; he attempted in vain to\r\nevade the royal acquisitiveness, by giving up the larger stone to the\r\nking and concealing the other. A fine stone, known by the formidable\r\nappellation of ‘Gnaga Boh’ (Dragon Lord), weighed 44 carats in the\r\nrough and 20 carats after cutting. Since the mines were taken over\r\nby the Ruby Mines, Ltd., a few large stones have been discovered. A\r\nbeautiful ruby was found in the Tagoungnandaing Valley, and weighed\r\n18½ carats in the rough and 11 carats after cutting; perfectly clear\r\nand of splendid colour, it was sold for £7000, but is now valued at\r\n£10,000. Another, weighing 77 carats in the rough, was found in 1899,\r\nand was sold in India in 1904 for 4 lakhs of rupees (£26,667). A stone,\r\nweighing 49 carats, was discovered in 1887, and an enormous one,\r\nweighing as much as 304 carats, in 1890.\r\n\r\nThe ruby, as large as a pigeon’s egg, which is amongst the Russian\r\nregalia was presented in 1777 to the Czarina Catherine by Gustav III of\r\nSweden when on a visit to St. Petersburg. The large red stone in the\r\nEnglish regalia which was supposed to be a ruby is a spinel (cf p. 206).\r\n\r\nComparatively uncommon as sapphires are in the Burma mines a faultless\r\nstone, weighing as much as 79½ carats, has been discovered there.\r\n\r\nGood rubies, mostly darker in colour than the Burmese stones, are\r\nfound in considerable quantity near Bangkok in Siam, Chantabun\r\nbeing the centre of the trade, where, just as in Burma, they are\r\nintimately associated with the red spinel. Because of the difference\r\nin tint and the consequent difference in price, jewellers draw a\r\ndistinction between Burma and Siam rubies; but that, of course, does\r\nnot signify any specific difference between them. Siam is, however,\r\nmost distinguished as the original home of splendid sapphires. The\r\ndistrict of Bo Pie Rin in Battambang produces, indeed, more than\r\nhalf the world’s supply of sapphires. In the Hills of Precious\r\nStones, such being the meaning of the native name for the locality, a\r\nnumber of green corundums are found. Siam also produces brown stones\r\ncharacterized by a peculiar silkiness of structure. Rubies are found in\r\nAfghanistan at the Amir’s mines near Kabul and also to the north of the\r\nlapis lazuli mines in Badakshan.\r\n\r\nThe conditions in Ceylon are precisely the converse of those obtaining\r\nin Burma; sapphire is plentiful and ruby rare in the island. They are\r\nfound in different rocks, sapphire occurring with garnet in gneiss, and\r\nruby accompanying spinel in limestone, but they come together in the\r\nresulting gravels, the principal locality being the gem-district near\r\nRatnapura in the south of the island. The largest uncut ruby discovered\r\nin Ceylon weighed 42½ carats; it had, however, a decided tinge of\r\nblue in it. Ceylon is also noted for the magnificent yellow corundum,\r\n‘oriental topaz,’ or, as it is locally called, ‘king topaz,’ which it\r\nproduces.\r\n\r\nBeautiful sapphires occur in various parts of India, but particularly\r\nin the Zanskar range of the north-western Himalayas in the state of\r\nKashmir, where they are associated with brown tourmaline. Probably most\r\nof the large sapphires known have emanated from India. By far the most\r\ngigantic ever reported is one, weighing 951 carats, said to have been\r\nseen in 1827 in the treasury of the King of Ava. The collection at the\r\nJardin des Plantes contains two splendid rough specimens; one, known as\r\nthe ‘Rospoli,’ is quite flawless and weighs 132-1/16 carats, and the\r\nother is 2 inches in length and 1½ inches in thickness. The Duke of\r\nDevonshire possesses a fine cut stone, weighing 100 carats, which is\r\nbrilliant-cut above and step-cut below the girdle. An image of Buddha,\r\nwhich is cut out of a single sapphire, is exhibited, mounted on a gold\r\npin, in the Mineral Gallery of the British Museum (Natural History).\r\n\r\nFor some years past a large quantity of sapphires have come into the\r\nmarket from Montana, U.S.A., especially from the gem-district about\r\ntwelve miles west of Helena. The commonest colour is a bluish green,\r\ngenerally pale, but blue, green, yellow and occasionally red stones are\r\nalso found; they are characterized by their almost metallic lustre.\r\nWith them are associated gold, colourless topaz, kyanite, and a\r\nbeautiful red garnet which is found in grains and usually mistaken for\r\nruby. Rubies are also found in limestone at Cowee Creek, North Carolina.\r\n\r\nBlue and red corundum, of rather poor quality, has come from the\r\nSanarka River, near Troitsk, and from Miask, in the Government of\r\nOrenburg, Russia, and similar stones have been known at Campolongo, St.\r\nGothard, Switzerland.\r\n\r\nThe prolific gem-district near Anakie, Queensland, supplies examples of\r\nevery known variety of corundum except ruby; blue, green, yellow, and\r\nparti-coloured stones, and also star-stones, are plentiful. Leaf-green\r\ncorundum is known father south, in Victoria. The Australian sapphire is\r\ntoo dark to be of much value.\r\n\r\nSmall rubies and sapphires are found in the gem-gravels near the\r\nSomabula Forest, Rhodesia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XX\r\n\r\n                                 BERYL\r\n\r\n                (_Emerald_, _Aquamarine_, _Morganite_)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe species to be considered in this chapter includes the varieties\r\nemerald and aquamarine, as well as what jewellers understand by beryl.\r\nIt has many incontestable claims on the attention of all lovers of the\r\nbeautiful in precious stones. The peerless emerald (Plate I, Fig. 5),\r\nwhich in its verdant beauty recalls the exquisite lawns that grace the\r\ncourts and quadrangles of our older seats of learning, ranks to-day\r\nas the most costly of jewels. Its sister stone, the lovely aquamarine\r\n(Plate I, Fig. 4), which seems to have come direct from some mermaid’s\r\ntreasure-house in the depths of a summer sea, has charms not to be\r\ndenied. Pliny, speaking of this species, truly says, “There is not a\r\ncolour more pleasing to the eye”; yet he knew only the comparatively\r\ninferior stones from Egypt, and possibly from the Ural Mountains.\r\nEmeralds are favourite ring-stones, and would, no doubt, be equally\r\ncoveted for larger articles of jewellery did not the excessive cost\r\nforbid, and nothing could be more attractive for a central stone than\r\na choice aquamarine of deep blue-green hue. Emeralds are usually\r\nstep-cut, though Indian lapidaries often favour the _en cabochon_\r\nform; aquamarines, on the other hand, are brilliant-cut in front and\r\nstep-cut at the back.\r\n\r\nBeryl, to use the name by which the species is known to science, is\r\nessentially a silicate of aluminium and beryllium corresponding to the\r\nformula, Be_{3}Al_{2}(SiO_{3})_{6}. The beryllia is often partially\r\nreplaced by small amounts of the alkaline earths, caesia, potash, soda,\r\nand lithia, varying from about 1½ per cent. in beryl from Mesa Grande\r\nto nearly 5 in that from Pala and Madagascar, and over 6, of which 3·6\r\nis caesia, in beryl from Hebron, Maine; also, as usual, chromic and\r\nferric oxides take the place of a little alumina; from 1 to 2 per cent.\r\nof water has been found in emerald. The element beryllium was, as its\r\nname suggests, first discovered in a specimen of this species, the\r\ndiscovery being made in 1798 by the chemist Vauquelin; it is also known\r\nas glucinum in allusion to the sweet taste of its salts.\r\n\r\nWhen pure, beryl is colourless, but it is rarely, if ever, free\r\nfrom a tinge of blue or green. The colour is usually some shade of\r\ngreen—grass-green, of that characteristic tint which is in consequence\r\nknown as emerald-green, or blue-green, yellowish green (Plate I, Fig.\r\n6), and sometimes yellow, pink, and rose-red. The peculiar colour of\r\nemerald is supposed to be caused by chromic oxide, small quantities\r\nof which have been detected in it by chemical analysis; moreover,\r\nexperiment shows that glass containing the same percentage amount of\r\nchromic oxide assumes the same splendid hue. Emerald, on being heated,\r\nloses water, but retains its colour unimpaired, which cannot therefore\r\nbe due, as has been suggested, to organic matter. The term aquamarine\r\nis applied to the deep sea-green and blue-green stones, and jewellers\r\nrestrict the term beryl to paler shades and generally other colours,\r\nsuch as yellow, golden, and pink, but Kunz has recently proposed the\r\nname morganite to distinguish the beautiful rose beryl such as is\r\nfound in Madagascar. The varying shades of aquamarine are due to the\r\ninfluence of the alkaline earths modified by the presence of ferric\r\noxide or chromic oxide; the beautiful blushing hue of morganite is no\r\ndoubt caused by lithia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 70.—Emerald Crystal.]\r\n\r\nThe name of the species is derived from the Greek βήρυλλος, an ancient\r\nword, the meaning of which has been lost in the mists of time. The\r\nGreek word denoted the same species in part as that now understood\r\nby the name. Emerald is derived from a Persian word which appeared\r\nin Greek as σμάραγδος, and in Latin as _smaragdus_; it originally\r\ndenoted chrysocolla, or similar green stone, but was transferred upon\r\nthe introduction of the deep-green beryl from Upper Egypt. The name\r\naquamarine was suggested by Pliny’s exceedingly happy description of\r\nthe stones “which imitate the greenness of the clear sea,” although it\r\nwas not actually used by him. That emerald and beryl were one species\r\nwas suspected by Pliny, but the identity was not definitely established\r\ntill about a century ago. Morganite is named after John Pierpont Morgan.\r\n\r\nThe natural crystals have the form of a six-sided prism, and in the\r\ncase of emerald (Fig. 70, and Plate I, Fig. 8) invariably, if whole,\r\nend in a single face at right angles to the length of the prism;\r\naquamarines have in addition a number of small inclined faces, and\r\nstones from both Russia and Brazil often taper owing to the effects\r\nof corrosion. The sixfold character of the crystalline symmetry\r\nnecessarily entails that the double refraction, which is small in\r\namount, 0·006, is uniaxial in character, and, since the ordinary\r\nis greater than the extraordinary refractive index, it is negative\r\nin sign. The values of the indices range between 1·567 and 1·590,\r\nand 1·572 and 1·598 respectively, in the two cases, the pink beryl\r\npossessing the highest values. The dichroism is distinct in the South\r\nAmerican emerald, the twin colours being yellowish and bluish green,\r\nbut otherwise is rather faint. The specific gravity varies between\r\n2·69 and 2·79, and is therefore a little higher than that of quartz.\r\nIf, therefore, a beryl and a quartz be floating together in a tube\r\ncontaining a suitable heavy liquid, the former will always be at a\r\nsensibly lower level (cf. Fig. 32). The hardness varies from 7½ to\r\n8, emerald being a little softer than the other varieties. There is\r\nno cleavage, but like most gem-stones beryl is very brittle, and can\r\neasily be fractured. Stones rendered cloudy by fissures are termed\r\n‘mossy.’ When heated before the blowpipe beryl is fusible with\r\ndifficulty; it resists the attack of hydrofluoric acid as well as of\r\nordinary acids.\r\n\r\nIn all probability the whole of the emeralds known in ancient times\r\ncame from the so-called Cleopatra emerald mines in Upper Egypt. For\r\nsome reason they were abandoned, and their position was so completely\r\nlost that in the Middle Ages it was maintained that emeralds had never\r\nbeen found in Egypt at all, but had come from America by way of the\r\nEast. All doubts were set at rest by the re-discovery of the mines\r\nearly last century by Cailliaud, who had been sent by the Viceroy of\r\nEgypt to search for them. They were, however, not much worked, and\r\nafter a few years were closed again, and were re-opened only about ten\r\nyears ago. The principal mines are at Jebel Zabara and at Jebel Sikait\r\nin northern Etbai, about 10 miles (16 km.) apart and distant about 15\r\nmiles (24 km.) from the Red Sea, lying in the range of mountains that\r\nrun for a long distance parallel to the west coast of the Red Sea and\r\nrise to over 1800 feet (550 m.) above sea-level. There are numerous\r\nsigns of considerable, but primitive, workings at distinct periods.\r\nBoth emeralds and beryls are found in micaceous and talcose schists.\r\nThe emeralds are not of very good quality, being cloudy and rather\r\nlight in colour. Finer emeralds have been found in a dark mica-schist,\r\ntogether with other beryllium minerals, chrysoberyl and phenakite, and\r\nalso topaz and tourmaline on the Asiatic side of the Ural Mountains,\r\nnear the Takowaja River, which flows into the Bolshoi Reft River, one\r\nof the larger tributaries of the Pyschma River, about fifty miles (80\r\nkm.) east of Ekaterinburg, a town which is chiefly concerned with the\r\nmining and cutting of gem-stones. The mine was accidentally discovered\r\nby a peasant, who noticed a few green stones at the foot of an uprooted\r\ntree in 1830. Two years later the mine was regularly worked, and\r\nremained open for twenty years, when it was closed. It has recently\r\nbeen re-opened owing to the high rates obtaining for emeralds. Very\r\nlarge crystals have been produced here, but in colour they are much\r\ninferior to the South American stones; small Siberian emeralds, on the\r\nother hand, are of better colour than small South American emeralds,\r\nthe latter being not so deep in tint. Emeralds have been found in a\r\nsimilar kind of schist at Habachtal, in the Salzburg Alps. About thirty\r\nyears ago well-formed green stones were discovered with hiddenite at\r\nStony Point, Alexander County, in North Carolina, but not much gem\r\nmaterial has come to light.\r\n\r\nThe products of none of the mines that have just been mentioned can\r\non the whole compare with the beautiful stones which have come from\r\nSouth America. At the time when the Spaniards grimly conquered Peru\r\nand ruthlessly despoiled the country of the treasures which could be\r\ncarried away, immense numbers of emeralds—some of almost incredible\r\nsize—were literally poured into Spain, and eventually found their\r\nway to other parts of Europe. These stones were known as Spanish or\r\nPeruvian emeralds, but in all probability none of them were actually\r\nmined in Peru. Perhaps the most extraordinary were the five choice\r\nstones which Cortez presented to his bride, the niece of the Duke de\r\nBejar, thereby mortally offending the Queen, who had desired them for\r\nherself, and which were lost in 1529 when Cortez was shipwrecked on\r\nhis disastrous voyage to assist Charles V at the siege of Algiers.\r\nAll five stones had been worked to divers fantastic shapes. One was\r\ncut like a bell with a fine pearl for a tongue, and bore on the rim,\r\nin Spanish, “Blessed is he who created thee.” A second was shaped\r\nlike a rose, and a third like a horn. A fourth was fashioned like a\r\nfish, with eyes of gold. The fifth, which was the most valuable and\r\nthe most remarkable of all, was hollowed out into the form of a\r\ncup, and had a foot of gold; its rim, which was formed of the same\r\nprecious metal, was engraved with the words, “Inter natos mulierum non\r\nsurrexit major.” As soon as the Spaniards had seized nearly all the\r\nemeralds that the natives had amassed in their temples or for personal\r\nadornment, they devoted their attention to searching for the source\r\nof these marvels of nature, and eventually in 1558 they lighted by\r\naccident upon the mines in what is now the United States of Colombia,\r\nwhich have been worked almost continuously since that time. Since the\r\nnatives, who naturally resented the gross injustice with which they\r\nhad been treated, and penetrated the greed that prompted the actions\r\nof the Spaniards, hid all traces of the mines, and refused to give any\r\ninformation as to their position, it is possible that other emerald\r\nmines may yet be found. The present mines are situated near the\r\nvillage of Muzo, about 75 miles (120 km.) north-north-west of Bogota,\r\nthe capital of Colombia. The emeralds occur in calcite veins in a\r\nbituminous limestone of Cretaceous age. The Spaniards formerly worked\r\nthe mines by driving adits through the barren rock on the hillsides to\r\nthe gem-bearing veins, but at the present day the open cut method of\r\nworking is employed. A plentiful supply of water is available, which\r\nis accumulated in reservoirs and allowed at the proper time to sweep\r\nthe debris of barren rock away into the Rio Minero, leaving the rock\r\ncontaining the emeralds exposed. Stones, of good quality, which are\r\nsuited for cutting, are locally known as _canutillos_, inferior stones,\r\ncoarse or ill-shaped, being called _morallons_.\r\n\r\nEmerald, unlike some green stones, retains its purity of colour in\r\nartificial light; in fact, to quote the words of Pliny, “For neither\r\nsun nor shade, nor yet the light of candle, causeth to change and lose\r\ntheir lustre.” Many are the superstitions that have been attached to\r\nit. Thus it was supposed to be good for the eyes, and as Pliny says,\r\n“Besides, there is not a gem or precious stone that so fully possesseth\r\nthe eye, and yet never contenteth it with satiety. Nay, if the sight\r\nhath been wearied and dimmed by intentive poring upon anything else,\r\nthe beholding of this stone doth refresh and restore it again.” The\r\nidea that it was fatal to the eyesight of serpents appears in Moore’s\r\nlines—\r\n\r\n    “Blinded like serpents when they gaze\r\n     Upon the emerald’s virgin blaze.”\r\n\r\nThe crystals occur attached to the limestone, and are therefore never\r\nfound doubly terminated. The crystal form is very simple, merely a\r\nhexagonal prism with a flat face at the one end at right angles to it.\r\nThey are invariably flawed, so much so that a flawless emerald has\r\npassed into proverb as unattainable perfection. The largest single\r\ncrystal which is known to exist at the present day is in the possession\r\nof the Duke of Devonshire (Fig. 71). In section it is nearly a regular\r\nhexagon, about 2 inches (51 mm.) in diameter from side to side, and\r\nthe length is about the same; its weight is 276·79 grams (9¾ oz. Av.,\r\nor 1347 carats). It is of good colour, but badly flawed. It was given\r\nto the Duke of Devonshire by Dom Pedro of Brazil, and was exhibited\r\nat the Great Exhibition of 1851. A fine, though much smaller crystal,\r\nbut of even better colour, which weighs 32·2 grams (156½ carats), and\r\nmeasures 1⅛ inch (28 mm.) in its widest cross-diameter, and about the\r\nsame in length, was acquired with the Allan-Greg collection by the\r\nBritish Museum, and is exhibited in the Mineral Gallery of the British\r\nMuseum (Natural History). The finest cut emerald is said to be one\r\nweighing 30 carats, which belongs to the Czar of Russia. A small, but\r\nperfect and flawless, faceted emerald, which is set in a gold hoop, is\r\nalso in the British Museum (Natural History). It is shown, without the\r\nsetting, about actual size, on Plate I, Fig. 5.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 71.—Duke of Devonshire’s Emerald.\r\n\r\n(Natural size.)]\r\n\r\nThe ever great demand and the essentially restricted supply have forced\r\nthe cost of emeralds of good quality to a height that puts large stones\r\nbeyond the reach of all but a privileged few who have purses deep\r\nenough. The rate per carat may be anything from £15 upwards, depending\r\nupon the purity of the colour and the freedom from flaws, but it\r\nincreases very rapidly with the size, since flawless stones of more\r\nthan 4 carats or so in weight are among the rarest of jewels; a perfect\r\nemerald of 4 carats may easily fetch £1600 to £2000. It seems anomalous\r\nto say that it has never been easier to procure fine stones than during\r\nrecent years, but the reason is that the high prices prevailing have\r\ntempted owners of old jewellery to realize their emeralds. On the other\r\nhand, pale emeralds are worth only a nominal sum.\r\n\r\nThe other varieties of beryl are much less rare, and, since they\r\nusually attain to more considerable, and sometimes even colossal, size,\r\nfar larger stones are obtainable. An aquamarine, particularly of good\r\ndeep blue-green colour, is a stone of great beauty, and it possesses\r\nthe merit of preserving its purity of tint in artificial light. It is a\r\nfavourite stone for pendants, brooches, and bracelets, and all purposes\r\nfor which a large blue or green stone is desired. The varying tints are\r\nsaid to be due to the presence of iron in different percentages, and\r\npossibly in different states of oxidation. Unlike emerald, the other\r\nvarieties are by no means so easily recognized by their colour. Blue\r\naquamarines may easily be mistaken for topaz, or vice versa, and the\r\nyellow beryl closely resembles other yellow stones, such as quartz,\r\ntopaz, or tourmaline. Stones which are colourless or only slightly\r\ntinted command little more than the price of cutting, but the price of\r\nblue-green stones rapidly advances with increasing depth of tint up\r\nto £2 a carat. The enormous cut aquamarine which is exhibited in the\r\nMineral Gallery of the British Museum (Natural History), affords some\r\nidea of the great size such stones reach; a beautiful sea-green in\r\ncolour, it weighs 179·5 grams (875 carats), and is table-cut with an\r\noval contour.\r\n\r\nThe splendid six-sided columns which have been discovered in various\r\nparts of Siberia are among the most striking specimens in any large\r\nmineral collection. The neighbourhood of Ekaterinburg in the Urals\r\nis prolific in varieties of aquamarine; especially at Mursinka have\r\nfine stones been found, in association with topaz, amethyst, and\r\nschorl, the black tourmaline. Good stones also occur in conjunction\r\nwith topaz at Miask in the Government of Orenburg. It is found in the\r\ngold-washings of the Sanarka River, in the Southern Urals, but the\r\nstones are not fitted for service as gems. Magnificent blue-green and\r\nyellow aquamarines are associated with topaz and smoky quartz in the\r\ngranite of the Adun-Tschilon Mountains, near Nertschinsk, Transbaikal.\r\nStones have also been found at the Urulga River in Siberia. Most\r\nof the bluish-green aquamarines which come into the market at the\r\npresent time have originated in Brazil, particularly in Minas Novas,\r\nMinas Geraes, where clear, transparent stones, of pleasing colour, in\r\nvarious shades, are found in the utmost profusion; beautiful yellow\r\nstones also occur at the Bahia mines. Aquamarine was obtained in very\r\nearly times in Coimbatore District, Madras, India, and yellow beryl\r\ncomes from Ceylon. Fine blue crystals occur in the granite of the\r\nMourne Mountains, Ireland, but they are not clear enough for cutting\r\npurposes; similar stones are found also at Limoges, Haute Vienne,\r\nFrance. Aquamarines of various hues abound in several places in the\r\nUnited States, among the principal localities being Stoneham in Maine,\r\nHaddam in Connecticut, and Pala and Mesa Grande in San Diego County,\r\nCalifornia. The last-named state is remarkable for the numerous stones\r\nof varying depth of salmon-pink that have been found there. It is,\r\nhowever, surpassed by Madagascar, which has recently produced splendid\r\nstones of perfect rose-red tint and of the finest gem quality, some of\r\nthem being nearly 100 carats in weight. These stones, which have been\r\nassigned a special name, morganite (cf. _supra_), are associated with\r\ntourmaline and kunzite. Pink and yellow beryls and deep blue-green\r\naquamarines occur in the island in quantity. The pink beryls from\r\nCalifornia are generally pale or have a pronounced salmon tint, and\r\nseldom approach the real rose-red colour of morganite; one magnificent\r\nrose-red crystal, weighing nearly 9 lb. (4·05 kg.), has, however, been\r\nrecently discovered in San Diego County, California, and is now in the\r\nBritish Museum (Natural History). Blue-green beryl, varying in tint\r\nfrom almost colourless to an emerald-green, occurs with tin-stone and\r\ntopaz about 9 miles (14½ km.) north-east of Emmaville in New South\r\nWales, Australia.\r\n\r\nProbably the largest and finest aquamarine crystal ever seen was one\r\nfound by a miner on March 28, 1910, at a depth of 15 ft. (5 m.) in a\r\npegmatite vein at Marambaya, near Arassuahy, on the Jequitinhonha\r\nRiver, Minas Geraes, Brazil. It was greenish blue in colour, and a\r\nslightly irregular hexagonal prism, with a flat face at each end, in\r\nform; it measured 19 in. (48·5 cm.) in length and 16 in. (41 cm.) in\r\ndiameter, and weighed 243 lb. (110·5 kg.); and its transparency was so\r\nperfect that it could be seen through from end to end (Plate XXVI). The\r\ncrystal was transported to Bahia, and sold for $25,000 (£5133).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PLATE XXVI_\r\n\r\nLARGE AQUAMARINE CRYSTAL (_one-sixth natural size_), FOUND AT\r\nMARAMBAYA, MINAS GERAES, BRAZIL]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           PART II—SECTION B\r\n\r\n                         SEMI-PRECIOUS STONES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\n                                 TOPAZ\r\n\r\n\r\nTopaz is the most popular yellow stone in jewellery, and often\r\nforms the principal stone in brooches or pendants, especially in\r\nold-fashioned articles. It is a general idea that all yellow stones\r\nare topazes, and all topazes are yellow; but neither statement is\r\ncorrect. A very large number of yellow stones that masquerade as\r\ntopaz are really the yellow quartz known as citrine. The latter is,\r\nindeed, almost universally called by jewellers topaz, the qualification\r\n‘Brazilian’ being used by them to distinguish the true topaz. Many\r\nspecies besides those mentioned yield yellow stones. Thus corundum\r\nincludes the beautiful ‘oriental topaz’ or yellow sapphire, and yellow\r\ntourmalines are occasionally met with; the yellow chrysoberyl always\r\nhas a greenish tinge. Topaz is generally brilliant-cut in front and\r\nstep-cut at the back, and the table facet is sometimes rounded, but\r\nthe colourless stones are often cut as small brilliants; it takes an\r\nexcellent and dazzling polish.\r\n\r\nTopaz is a silicate of aluminium corresponding to the formula\r\n[Al(F,OH)]_{2}SiO_{4}, which was established in 1894 by Penfield and\r\nMinor as the result of careful research. Contrary to the general\r\nidea, topaz is usually colourless or very pale in tint. Yellow hues\r\nof different degrees, from pale to a rich sherry tint (Plate I, Fig.\r\n9), are common, and pure pale blue (Plate I, Fig. 7) and pale green\r\nstones, which often pass as aquamarine, are far from rare. Natural,\r\nred and pink, stones are very seldom to be met with. It is, however, a\r\npeculiarity of the brownish-yellow stones from Brazil that the colour\r\nis altered by heating to a lovely rose-pink. Curiously, the tint is not\r\napparent when the stone is hot, but develops as it cools to a normal\r\ntemperature; the colour seems to be permanent. Such stones are common\r\nin modern jewellery. Although the change in colour is accompanied by\r\nsome slight rearrangement of the constituent molecules, since such\r\nstones are invariably characterized by high refraction and pronounced\r\ndichroism, the crystalline symmetry, however, remaining unaltered,\r\nthe cause must be attributed to some change in the tinctorial agent,\r\nprobably oxidation. The yellow stones from Ceylon, if treated in a\r\nsimilar manner, lose their colour entirely. The pale yellow-brown\r\nstones from Russia fade on prolonged exposure to strong sunlight, for\r\nwhich reason the superb suite of crystals from the Urulga River, which\r\ncame with the Koksharov collection to the British Museum, are kept\r\nunder cover.\r\n\r\nThe name of the species is derived from _topazion_ (τοπάζειν, to\r\nseek), the name given to an island in the Red Sea, which in olden\r\ntimes was with difficulty located, but it was applied by Pliny and\r\nhis contemporaries to the yellowish peridot found there. The term\r\nwas applied in the Middle Ages loosely to any yellow stone, and was\r\ngradually applied more particularly to the stone that was then more\r\nprevalent, the topaz of modern science. As has already been pointed out\r\n(p. 111), the term is still employed in jewellery to signify any yellow\r\nstone. The true topaz was probably included by Pliny under the name\r\n_chrysolithus_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 72.—Topaz Crystal.]\r\n\r\nThe symmetry is orthorhombic, and the crystals are prismatic in shape\r\nand terminated by numerous inclined faces, and usually by a large\r\nface perpendicular to the prism edge (Fig. 72). Topaz cleaves with\r\ngreat readiness at right angles to the prism edge; owing to its facile\r\ncleavage, flaws are easily started, and caution must be exercised\r\nnot to damage a stone by knocking it against hard and unyielding\r\nsubstances. The dichroism of a yellow topaz is always perceptible,\r\none of the twin colours being distinctly more reddish than the other,\r\nand the phenomenon is very marked in the case of stones the colour of\r\nwhich has been artificially altered to pink. The values of the least\r\nand the greatest of the principal indices of refraction vary from 1·615\r\nto 1·629, and from 1·625 to 1·637, respectively, the double refraction\r\nbeing about 0·010 in amount, and positive in sign. The high values\r\ncorrespond to the altered stones. The specific gravity, the mean value\r\nof which is 3·55 with a variation of 0·05 on either side, is higher\r\nthan would be expected from the refractivity. A cleavage flake exhibits\r\nin convergent polarized light a wide-angled biaxial picture, the ‘eyes’\r\nlying outside the field of view. The relation of the principal optical\r\ndirections and the directions of single refraction to the crystal\r\nare shown in Fig. 27. The hardness is 8 on Mohs’s scale, and in this\r\ncharacter it is surpassed only by chrysoberyl, corundum, and diamond.\r\nTopaz is pyro-electric, in which respect tourmaline alone exceeds it,\r\nand it may be strongly electrified by friction.\r\n\r\nAlthough the range of refraction overlaps that of tourmaline, there\r\nis no risk of confusion, because the latter has nearly thrice the\r\namount of double refraction (cf. p. 29). Apart from the difference in\r\nrefraction, a yellow topaz ought never to be confused with a yellow\r\nquartz, because the former sinks, and the latter floats in methylene\r\niodide. The same test distinguishes topaz from beryl, and, indeed, from\r\ntourmaline also.\r\n\r\nJudged by the criterion of price, topaz is not in the first rank of\r\nprecious stones. Stones of good colour and free from flaws are now,\r\nhowever, scarce. Pale stones are worth very little, possibly less than\r\n4s. a carat, but the price rapidly advances with increase in colour,\r\nreaching 20s. for yellow, 80s. for pink and blue stones. Since topazes\r\nare procurable in all sizes customary in jewellery, the rates vary but\r\nslightly, if at all, with the size.\r\n\r\nTopaz occurs principally in pegmatite dykes and in cavities in granite,\r\nand is interesting to petrologists as a conspicuous instance of the\r\nresult of the action of hot acid vapours upon rocks rich in aluminium\r\nsilicates. Magnificent crystals have come from the extensive mining\r\ndistrict which stretches along the eastern flank of the Ural Mountains,\r\nand from the important mining region surrounding Nertschinsk, in the\r\nGovernment of Transbaikal, Siberia. Fine green and blue stones have\r\nbeen found at Alabashka, near Ekaterinburg, in the Government of Perm,\r\nand at Miask in the Ilmen Mountains, in the Government of Orenburg.\r\nTopazes of the rare reddish hue have been picked out from the gold\r\nwashings of the Sanarka River, Troitsk, also in the Government of\r\nOrenburg. Splendid pale-brown stones have issued from the Urulga River,\r\nnear Nertschinsk, and good crystals have come from the Adun-Tschilon\r\nMountains. Kamchatka has produced yellow, blue, and green stones. In\r\nthe British Isles, beautiful sky-blue, waterworn crystals have been\r\nfound at Cairngorm, Banffshire, in Scotland, and colourless stones in\r\nthe Mourne Mountains, Ireland, and at St. Michael’s Mount, Cornwall.\r\nMost of the topazes used in jewellery of the present day come from\r\neither Brazil or Ceylon. Ouro Preto, Villa Rica, and Minas Novas, in\r\nthe State of Minas Geraes, are the principal localities in Brazil.\r\nNumerous stones, often waterworn, brilliant and colourless or tinted\r\nlovely shades of blue and wine-yellow, occur there; reddish stones also\r\nhave been found at Ouro Preto. Ceylon furnishes a profusion of yellow,\r\nlight-green, and colourless, waterworn pebbles. The colourless stones\r\nfound there are incorrectly termed by the natives ‘water-sapphire,’ and\r\nthe light-green stones are sold with beryl as aquamarines; the stones\r\nlocally known as ‘king topaz’ are really yellow corundum (cf. p. 181).\r\nColourless crystals, sometimes with a faint tinge of colour, have\r\nbeen discovered in many parts of the world, such as Ramona, San Diego\r\nCounty, California, and Pike’s Peak, Colorado, in the United States,\r\nSan Luis Potosi in Mexico, and Omi and Otami-yama in Japan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\n                                SPINEL\r\n\r\n                      (_Balas-Ruby_, _Rubicelle_)\r\n\r\n\r\nSpinel labours under the serious disadvantage of being overshadowed at\r\nalmost all points by its opulent and more famous cousins, sapphire and\r\nruby, and is not so well known as it deserves to be. The only variety\r\nwhich is valued as a gem is the rose-tinted stone called balas-ruby\r\n(Plate XXVII, Fig. 3), which is very similar to the true ruby in\r\nappearance; they are probably often confused, especially since they\r\nare found in intimate association in nature. Spinels of other colours\r\nare not very attractive to the eye, and are not likely to be in much\r\ndemand. Blue spinel (Plate XXVII, Fig. 4) is far from common, but the\r\nshade is inclined to steely-blue, and is much inferior to the superb\r\ntint of the true sapphire. Spinel is very hard and eminently suitable\r\nfor a ring-stone, but is seldom large and transparent enough for larger\r\narticles of jewellery.\r\n\r\nSpinel is an aluminate of magnesium corresponding to the formula\r\nMgAl_{2}O_{4}, and therefore is closely akin to corundum, alumina, and\r\nchrysoberyl, aluminate of beryllium. The composition may, however,\r\nvary considerably owing to the isomorphous replacement of one element\r\nby another; in particular, ferrous oxide or manganese oxide often\r\ntakes the place of some magnesia, and ferric oxide or chromic oxide is\r\nfound instead of part of the alumina. When pure, spinel is devoid of\r\ncolour, but such stones are exceedingly rare. No doubt chromic oxide is\r\nresponsible for the rose-red hue of balas-ruby, and also, when tempered\r\nby ferric oxide, for the orange tint of rubicelle, and manganese is\r\nprobably the cause of the peculiar violet colour of almandine-spinel.\r\nIt is scarcely possible to define all the shades between blue and red\r\nthat may be assumed by spinel. Stones which are rich in iron are known\r\nas pleonaste or ceylonite; they are quite opaque, but are sometimes\r\nused for ornamental wear.\r\n\r\nThe name of the species comes from a diminutive form of σπῖνος, a\r\nspark, and refers to the fiery red colour of the most valued kind\r\nof spinel. It may be noted that the Latin equivalent of the word,\r\n_carbunculus_, has been applied to the crimson garnet when cut\r\n_en cabochon_. Balas is derived from _Balascia_, the old name for\r\nBadakshan, the district from which the finest stones were brought in\r\nmediæval times.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGS. 73, 74.—Spinel Crystals.]\r\n\r\nSpinel, like diamond, belongs to the cubic system of crystalline\r\nsymmetry, and occurs in beautiful octahedra, or in flat\r\ntriangular-shaped plates (Figs. 73, 74) the girdles of which are\r\ncleft at each corner, these plates being really twinned octahedra.\r\nThe refraction is, of course, single, and there is therefore no\r\ndouble refraction or dichroism; this test furnishes the simplest\r\nway of discriminating between the balas and the true ruby. Owing to\r\nisomorphous replacement the value of the refractive index may lie\r\nanywhere between 1·716 and 1·736. The lower values, about 1·720,\r\ncorrespond to the most transparent red and blue stones; the deep\r\nviolet stones have values above 1·730. Spinel possesses little\r\ncolour-dispersion, or ‘fire.’ In the same way the values of the\r\nspecific gravity, even of the transparent stones, vary between 3·5\r\nand 3·7, but the opaque ceylonite has values as high as 4·1. Spinel\r\nis slightly softer than sapphire and ruby, and has the symbol 8 on\r\nMohs’s scale, and it is scarcely inferior in lustre to these stones.\r\nSpinel is easily separated from garnet of similar colour by its lower\r\nrefractivity. Spinels run from 10s. to £5 a carat, depending on their\r\ncolour and quality, and exceptional stones command a higher rate.\r\n\r\nSpinel always occurs in close association with corundum. The balas\r\nand the true ruby are mixed together in the limestones of Burma and\r\nSiam. Curiously enough, the spinel despite its lower hardness is found\r\nin the river gravels in perfect crystals, whereas the rubies are\r\ngenerally waterworn. Fine violet and blue spinels occur in the prolific\r\ngem-gravels of Ceylon. A large waterworn octahedron and a rough mass,\r\nboth of a fine red colour, are exhibited in the Mineral Gallery of the\r\nBritish Museum (Natural History), and a beautiful faceted blue stone is\r\nshown close by.\r\n\r\nThe enormous red stone, oval in shape, which is set in front of the\r\nEnglish crown, is not a ruby, as it was formerly believed to be,\r\nbut a spinel. It was given to the gallant Black Prince by Pedro the\r\nCruel after the battle of Najera in 1367, and was subsequently worn\r\nby Henry V upon his helmet at the battle of Agincourt. As usual with\r\nIndian-fashioned stones it is pierced through the middle, but the hole\r\nis now hidden by a small stone of similar colour.\r\n\r\nThe British Regalia also contains the famous stone called the Timur\r\nRuby or Khiraj-i-Alam (Tribute of the World), which weighs just over\r\n352 carats, and is the largest spinel-ruby known. It is uncut, but\r\npolished. Its history goes back to 1398, when it was captured by the\r\nAmir Timur at Delhi. On the wane of the Tartar empire the stone became\r\nthe property of the Shahs of Persia, until it was given by Abbas I to\r\nhis friend and ally, the Mogul Emperor, Jehangir. It remained at Delhi\r\nuntil, on the sack of that city by Nadir Shah in 1739, it, together\r\nwith immense booty, including the Koh-i-nor, fell into the hands of\r\nthe conqueror. Like the great diamond, it eventually came into the\r\npossession of Runjit Singh at Lahore, and on the annexation of the\r\nPunjab in 1850 passed to the East India Company. It was shown at the\r\nGreat Exhibition of 1851, and afterwards presented to Queen Victoria.\r\n\r\nMention has been made above (p. 121) of the blue spinel which is\r\nmanufactured in imitation of the true sapphire. The artificial stone is\r\nquite different in tint from the blue spinel found in nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\n                                GARNET\r\n\r\n\r\nThe important group of minerals which are known under the general name\r\nof garnet provides an apt illustration of the fact that rarity is an\r\nessential condition if a stone is to be accounted precious. Owing to\r\nthe large quantity of Bohemian garnets, of a not very attractive shade\r\nof yellowish red, that have been literally poured upon the market\r\nduring the past half-century the species has become associated with\r\ncheap and often ineffective jewellery, and has acquired a stigma which\r\ncompletely prevents its attaining any popularity with those professing\r\na nice taste in gem-stones. It must not, however, be supposed that\r\ngarnet has entirely disappeared from high-class jewellery although the\r\nname may not readily be found in a jeweller’s catalogue. Those whose\r\nbusiness it is to sell gem-stones are fully alive to the importance of\r\na name, and, as has already been remarked (p. 109), they have been fain\r\nto meet the prejudices of their customers by offering garnets under\r\nsuch misleading guises as ‘Cape-ruby,’ ‘Uralian emerald,’ or ‘olivine.’\r\n\r\nGarnets may, moreover, figure under another name quite unintentionally.\r\nProbably many a fine stone masquerades as a true ruby; the\r\nimpossibility of distinguishing these two species in certain cases by\r\neye alone is perhaps not widely recognized. An instructive instance\r\ncame under the writer’s notice a few years ago. A lady one day had\r\nthe misfortune to fracture one of the stones in a ruby ring that had\r\nbeen in the possession of her family for upwards of a century, and\r\nwas originally purchased of a leading firm of jewellers in London.\r\nShe took the ring to her jeweller, and asked him to have the stone\r\nreplaced by another ruby. A day or two later he sent word that it was\r\nscarcely worth while to put a ruby in because the stones in the ring\r\nwere paste. Naturally distressed at such an opinion of a ring which had\r\nalways been held in great esteem by her family, the lady consulted a\r\nfriend, who suggested showing it to the writer. A glance was sufficient\r\nto prove that if the ring had been in use so long the stones could not\r\npossibly be paste on account of the excellent state of their polish,\r\nbut a test with the refractometer showed that the stones were really\r\nalmandine-garnets, which so often closely resemble the true ruby in\r\nappearance. Beautiful as the stones were, the ring was probably not\r\nworth one-tenth what the value would have been had the stones been\r\nrubies.\r\n\r\nTo the student of mineralogy garnet is for many reasons of peculiar\r\ninterest. It affords an excellent illustration of the facility which\r\ncertain elements possess for replacing one another without any great\r\ndisturbance of the crystalline form. Despite their apparent complexity\r\nin composition all garnets conform to the same type of formula: lime,\r\nmagnesia, and ferrous and manganese oxides, and again alumina and\r\nferric and chromic oxides may replace each other in any proportion,\r\niron being present in two states of oxidation, and it would be rare\r\nto find a stone which agrees in composition exactly with any of the\r\ndifferent varieties of garnet given below.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGS. 75, 76.—Garnet Crystals.]\r\n\r\nGarnet belongs to the cubic system of crystalline symmetry.\r\nIts crystals are commonly of two kinds, both of which are very\r\ncharacteristic, the regular dodecahedron, _i.e._ twelve-faced figure\r\n(Fig. 75), and the tetrakis-octahedron or three-faced octahedron (Fig.\r\n76); the latter crystals are, especially when weather- or water-worn,\r\nalmost spherical in shape. Closer and more refined observations have\r\nshown that garnet is seldom homogeneous, being usually composed of\r\nseveral distinct individuals of a lower order of symmetry. Although\r\nsingly refractive as far as can be determined with the refractometer or\r\nby deviation through a prism, yet when examined under the polarizing\r\nmicroscope, garnets display invariably a small amount of local double\r\nrefraction. The transition from light to darkness is, however, not\r\nsharp as in normal cases, but is prolonged into a kind of twilight.\r\nIn hardness, garnet is on the whole about the same as quartz, but\r\nvaries slightly; hessonite and andradite are a little softer, pyrope,\r\nspessartite, and almandine are a little harder, while uvarovite is\r\nalmost the same. All the varieties except uvarovite are fusible when\r\nheated before the blowpipe, and small fragments melt sufficiently on\r\nthe surface in the ordinary bunsen flame to adhere to the platinum\r\nwire holding them. This test is very useful for separating rough red\r\ngarnets, pyrope or almandine, from red spinels or zircons of very\r\nsimilar appearance. Far greater variation occurs in the other physical\r\ncharacters. The specific gravity may have any value between 3·55 and\r\n4·20, and the refractive index ranges between 1·740 and 1·890. Both the\r\nspecific gravity and the refractive index increase on the whole with\r\nthe percentage amount of iron.\r\n\r\nGarnet is a prominent constituent of many kinds of rocks, but the\r\nmaterial most suitable for gem purposes occurs chiefly in crystalline\r\nschists or metamorphic limestones. Pyrope and demantoid are furnished\r\nby peridotites and the serpentines resulting from them; almandine and\r\nspessartite come mostly from granites.\r\n\r\nThe name of the species is derived from the Latin _granatus_,\r\nseed-like, and is suggested by the appearance of the spherical crystals\r\nwhen embedded in their pudding-like matrix.\r\n\r\nThe varieties most adapted to jewellery are the fiery-red pyrope and\r\nthe crimson and columbine-red almandine; the closer they approach the\r\nruddy hue of ruby the better they are appreciated. Hessonite was at one\r\ntime in some demand, but it inclines too much to the yellowish shade\r\nof red and possesses too little perfection of transparency to accord\r\nwith the taste of the present day. Demantoid provides beautiful, pale\r\nand dark emerald-green stones, of brilliant lustre and high dispersion,\r\nwhich are admirably adapted for use in pendants or necklaces; on\r\naccount of their comparative softness it would be unwise to risk them\r\nin rings. In many stones the colour takes a yellowish shade, which\r\nis less in demand. Uvarovite also occurs in attractive emerald-green\r\nstones, but unfortunately none as yet have been found large enough for\r\ncutting. A few truly magnificent spessartites are known—one, a splendid\r\nexample, weighing 6¾ carats, being in the possession of Sir Arthur\r\nChurch; but the species is far too seldom transparent to come into\r\ngeneral use. The price varies per carat from 2s. for common garnet to\r\n10s. for stones most akin to ruby in colour, and exceptional demantoids\r\nmay realize even as much as £10 a carat. The old style of cutting was\r\nalmost invariably rounded or _en cabochon_, but at the present day the\r\nbrilliant-cut front and the step-cut back is most commonly adopted.\r\n\r\nThe several varieties will now be considered in detail.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            (_a_) HESSONITE\r\n\r\n        (_Grossular_, _Cinnamon-Stone_, _Hyacinth_, _Jacinth_)\r\n\r\nThis variety, strictly a calcium-aluminium garnet corresponding to\r\nthe formula Ca_{3}Al_{2}(SiO_{4})_{3}, but generally containing some\r\nferric oxide and therefore tending towards andradite, is called by\r\nseveral different names. In science it is usually termed grossular, a\r\nword derived from _grossularia_, the botanical name for gooseberry, in\r\nallusion to the colour and appearance of many crystals, or hessonite,\r\nand less correctly essonite, words derived from the Greek ἥσσων\r\nin reference to the inferior hardness of these stones as compared\r\nwith zircon of similar colour; in jewellery it is better known as\r\ncinnamon-stone, if a golden-yellow in colour, or hyacinth or jacinth.\r\nThe last word, which is indiscriminately used for hessonite and yellow\r\nzircon, but should more properly be applied to the latter, is derived\r\nfrom an old Indian word (cf. p. 229); jewellers, however, retain it for\r\nthe garnet.\r\n\r\nOnly the yellow and orange shades of hessonite (Plate XXIX, Fig. 5)\r\nare used for jewellery. Neither the brownish-green kind, to which the\r\nterm grossular may properly be applied, nor the rose-red is transparent\r\nenough to serve as a gem-stone. Hessonite may mostly be recognized,\r\neven when cut, by the curiously granular nature of its structure, just\r\nas if it were composed of tiny grains imperfectly fused together; this\r\nappearance, which is very characteristic, may readily be perceived if\r\nthe interior of the stone be viewed through a lens of moderate power.\r\n\r\nThe specific gravity varies from 3·55 to 3·66, and the refractive index\r\nfrom 1·742 to 1·748. The hardness is on the whole slightly below that\r\nof quartz. When heated before a blowpipe it easily fuses to a greenish\r\nglass.\r\n\r\nThe most suitable material is found in some profusion in the\r\ngem-gravels of Ceylon, in which it is mixed up with zircon of an almost\r\nidentical appearance; both are called hyacinth. Hessonites from other\r\nlocalities, although attractive as museum specimens, are not large and\r\nclear enough for cutting purposes. Switzerland at one time supplied\r\ngood stones, but the supply has long been exhausted.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             (_b_) PYROPE\r\n\r\n                            (‘_Cape-Ruby_’)\r\n\r\nOften quite ruby-red in colour (Plate XXIX, Fig. 6), this variety\r\nis probably the most popular of the garnets. It is strictly\r\na magnesium-aluminium garnet corresponding to the formula\r\nMg_{3}Al_{2}(SiO_{4})_{3}, but usually contains some ferrous oxide\r\nand thus approaches almandine. Both are included among the precious\r\ngarnets. Its name is derived from πυρωπός, fire-like, in obvious\r\nallusion to its characteristic colour.\r\n\r\nAlthough at its best pyrope closely resembles ruby, its appearance is\r\noften marred by a tinge of yellow which decidedly detracts from its\r\nvalue. Pyrope generally passes as a variety of ruby, and under such\r\nnames as ‘Cape-ruby,’ ‘Arizona-ruby,’ depending on the origin of the\r\nstones, commands a brisk sale. The specific gravity varies upwards\r\nfrom 3·70, depending upon the percentage amount of iron present, and\r\nsimilarly the refractive index varies upwards from 1·740; in the higher\r\nvalues pyrope merges into almandine. Its hardness is slightly greater\r\nthan that of quartz, and may be expressed on Mohs’s scale by the symbol\r\n7¼.\r\n\r\nAn enormous quantity of small red stones, mostly with a slight tinge of\r\nyellow, have been brought to light at Teplitz, Aussig, and other spots\r\nin the Bohemian Mittelgebirge, and a considerable industry in cutting\r\nand marting them has grown up at Bilin. Fine ruby-red stones accompany\r\ndiamond in the ‘blue ground’ of the mines at Kimberley and also at the\r\nPremier mine in the Transvaal. Similar stones are also found in Arizona\r\nand Colorado in the United States, and in Australia, Rhodesia, and\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\nAlthough commonly quite small in size, pyrope has occasionally attained\r\nto considerable size. According to De Boodt the Kaiser Rudolph II had\r\none in his possession valued at 45,000 thalers (about £6750). The\r\nImperial Treasury at Vienna contains a stone as large as a hen’s egg.\r\nAnother about the size of a pigeon’s egg is in the famous Green Vaults\r\nat Dresden, and the King of Saxony has one, weighing 468½ carats, set\r\nin an Order of the Golden Fleece.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            (_c_) RHODOLITE\r\n\r\nThis charming pale-violet variety was found at Cowee Creek and at\r\nMason’s Branch, Macon County, North Carolina, U.S.A., but in too\r\nlimited amount to assume the position in jewellery it might otherwise\r\nhave expected. In composition it lies between pyrope and almandine,\r\nand may be supposed to contain a proportion of two molecules of the\r\nformer to one of the latter. Its specific gravity is 3·84, refractive\r\nindex 1·760, and hardness 7¼. It exhibits in the spectroscope the\r\nabsorption-bands characteristic of almandine.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            (_d_) ALMANDINE\r\n\r\n                             (_Carbuncle_)\r\n\r\nThis variety is iron-aluminium garnet corresponding to the formula\r\nFe_{3}Al_{2}(SiO_{4})_{3}, but the composition is very variable. In\r\ncolour it is deep crimson and violet or columbine-red (Plate XXIX, Fig.\r\n8), but with increasing percentage amount of ferric oxide it becomes\r\nbrown and black, and opaque, and quite unsuitable for jewellery. The\r\nname of the variety is a corruption of Alabanda in Asia Minor, where\r\nin Pliny’s time the best red stones were cut. Almandine is sometimes\r\nknown as Syriam, or incorrectly Syrian garnet, because at Syriam, once\r\nthe capital of the ancient kingdom of Pegu, which now forms part of\r\nLower Burma, such stones were cut and sold. Crimson stones, cut in the\r\nfamiliar _en cabochon_ form and known as carbuncles, were extensively\r\nemployed for enriching metalwork, and a half-century or so ago were\r\nvery popular for ornamental wear, but their day has long since gone.\r\nSuch glowing stones are aptly described by their name, which is derived\r\nfrom the Latin _carbunculus_, a little spark. In Pliny’s time, however,\r\nthe term was used indiscriminately for all red stones. It has already\r\nbeen remarked that the word spinel has a similar significance.\r\n\r\nThe specific gravity varies from 3·90 for transparent stones to 4·20\r\nfor the densest black stones, and the refractive index may be as high\r\nas 1·810. Almandine is one of the hardest of the garnets, and is\r\nrepresented by the symbol 7½ on Mohs’s scale. The most interesting and\r\ncurious feature of almandine lies in the remarkable and characteristic\r\nabsorption-spectrum revealed when the transmitted light is examined\r\nwith a spectroscope (p. 61). The phenomenon is displayed most vividly\r\nby the violet stones, and is, indeed, the cause of their peculiar\r\ncolour.\r\n\r\nAlthough a common mineral, almandine of a quality fitted for jewellery\r\noccurs in comparatively few localities. It is found in Ceylon, but\r\nnot so plentifully as hessonite. Good stones are mined in various\r\nparts of India, and are nearly all cut at Delhi or Jaipur. Brazil\r\nsupplies good material, especially in the Minas Novas district of\r\nMinas Geraes, where it accompanies topaz, and Uruguay also furnishes\r\nserviceable stones. Almandine is found in Australia, and in many parts\r\nof the United States. Recently small stones of good colour have been\r\ndiscovered at Luisenfelde in German East Africa.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           (_e_) SPESSARTITE\r\n\r\nProperly a manganese-aluminium garnet corresponding to the formula\r\nMn_{3}Al_{2}(SiO_{4})_{3}, this variety generally contains iron in\r\nboth states of oxidation. If only transparent and large enough its\r\naurora-red colour would render it most acceptable in jewellery. Two\r\nsplendid stones have, indeed, been found in Ceylon (p. 211), and good\r\nstones rather resembling hessonites have been quarried at Amelia\r\nCourt House in Virginia, and others have come from Nevada; otherwise,\r\nspessartite is unknown as a gem-stone.\r\n\r\nThe specific gravity ranges from 4·0 to 4·3, and the refractive index\r\nis about 1·81, both characters being high; the hardness is slightly\r\ngreater than that of quartz.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            (_f_) ANDRADITE\r\n\r\n               (_Demantoid_, _Topazolite_, ‘_Olivine_’)\r\n\r\nAndradite is strictly a calcium-iron garnet corresponding to the\r\nformula Ca_{3}Fe_{2}(SiO_{4})_{3}, but as usual the composition varies\r\nconsiderably. It is named after d’Andrada, a Portuguese mineralogist,\r\nwho made a study of garnet more than a century ago.\r\n\r\nOnce contemptuously styled common garnet, andradite suddenly sprang\r\ninto the rank of precious stones upon the discovery some thirty\r\nyears ago of the brilliant, green stones (Plate XXIX, Fig. 7) in the\r\nserpentinous rock beside the Bobrovka stream, a tributary of the\r\nTschussowaja River, in the Sissersk district on the western side of\r\nthe Ural Mountains. The shade of green varies from olive through\r\npistachio to a pale emerald, and is probably due to chromic oxide. Its\r\nbrilliant lustre, almost challenging that of diamond, and its enormous\r\ncolour-dispersion, in which respect it actually transcends diamond,\r\nraise it to a unique position among coloured stones. Unfortunately\r\nits comparative softness limits it to such articles of jewellery as\r\npendants and necklaces, where it is not likely to be rubbed. When first\r\nfound it was supposed to be true emerald, which does actually occur\r\nnear Ekaterinburg, and was termed ‘Uralian emerald.’ When analysis\r\nrevealed its true nature, it received from science the slightly\r\ninharmonious name of demantoid in compliment to its adamantine lustre.\r\nJewellers, however, prefer to designate it ‘olivine,’ not very happily,\r\nbecause the stones usually cut are not olive-green and the name is\r\nalready in extensive use in science for a totally distinct species (p.\r\n225); they recognized the hopelessness of endeavouring to find a market\r\nfor them as garnets. The yellow kind of andradite known as topazolite\r\nwould be an excellent gem-stone if only it were found large and\r\ntransparent enough. Ordinary andradite is brown or black, and opaque;\r\nit has occasionally been used for mourning jewellery.\r\n\r\nThe specific gravity varies from 3·8 to 3·9, being about 3·85 for\r\ndemantoid, which has a high refractive index, varying from 1·880 to\r\n1·890, and may with advantage be cut in the brilliant form. It is the\r\nsoftest of the garnets, being only 6½ on Mohs’s scale.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            (_g_) UVAROVITE\r\n\r\nThis variety, which is altogether unknown in jewellery, is\r\na calcium-iron garnet corresponding mainly to the formula\r\nCa_{3}Cr_{2}(SiO_{4})_{3}, but with some alumina always present, and\r\nwas named after a Russian minister. It has an attractive green colour,\r\nand is, moreover, hard, being about on Mohs’s scale, but it has never\r\nyet come to light of a size suitable for cutting. The specific gravity\r\nis low, varying from 3·41 to 3·52. Unlike the kindred varieties it\r\ncannot be fused by heating before an ordinary blowpipe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\n                              TOURMALINE\r\n\r\n                             (_Rubellite_)\r\n\r\n\r\nTourmaline is unsurpassed even by corundum in variety of hue, and\r\nit has during recent years rapidly advanced in public favour,\r\nmainly owing to the prodigal profusion in which nature has formed\r\nit in that favoured State, California, the garden of the west. Its\r\ncomparative softness militates against its use in rings, but its\r\ngorgeous coloration renders it admirably fitted for service in any\r\narticle of jewellery, such as a brooch or a pendant, in which a large\r\ncentral stone is required. Like all coloured stones it is generally\r\nbrilliant-cut in front and step-cut at the back, but occasionally it is\r\nsufficiently fibrous in structure to display, when cut _en cabochon_,\r\npronounced chatoyancy.\r\n\r\nThe composition of this complex species has long been a vexed\r\nquestion among mineralogists, but considerable light was\r\nrecently thrown on the subject by Schaller, who showed that all\r\nvarieties of tourmaline may be referred to a formula of the type\r\n12SiO_{2}.3B_{2}O_{3}.(9-_x_)[(Al,Fe)_{2}O_{3}].3_x_[(Fe,Mn,Ca,\r\nMg,K_{2},Na_{2},Li_{2},H_{2})O].3H_{2}O. The ratios of boric oxide,\r\nsilica, and water are nearly constant in all analyses, but great\r\nvariation is possible in the proportions of the other constituents.\r\nHaving regard to this complexity, it is not surprising to find that\r\nthe range in colour is so great. Colourless stones, to which the name\r\nachroite is sometimes given, were at one time exceedingly rare, but\r\nthey are now found in greater number in California. Stones which are\r\nmost suited to jewellery purposes are comparatively free from iron, and\r\napparently owe their wonderful tints to the alkaline earths; lithia,\r\nfor instance, is responsible for the beautiful tint of the highly\r\nprized rubellite, and magnesia, no doubt, for the colour of the brown\r\nstones of various tints. Tourmaline rich in iron is black and almost\r\nopaque. It is a striking peculiarity of the species that the crystals\r\nare rarely uniform in colour throughout, the boundaries between the\r\ndifferently coloured portions being sharp and abrupt, and the tints\r\nremarkably in contrast. Sometimes the sections are separated by planes\r\nat right angles to the length of the crystal, and sometimes they are\r\nzonal, bounded by cylindrical surfaces running parallel to the same\r\nlength. In the latter case a section perpendicular to the length shows\r\nzones of at least three contrasting tints. In the Brazilian stones the\r\ncore is generally red, bounded by white, with green on the exterior,\r\nwhile the reverse is the case in the Californian stones, the core being\r\ngreen or yellow, bounded by white, with red on the exterior. Tourmaline\r\nmay, indeed, be found of almost every imaginable tint, except,\r\nperhaps, the emerald green and the royal sapphire-blue. The principal\r\nvarieties are rose-red and pink (rubellite) (Plate XXVII, Fig. 1),\r\ngreen (Brazilian emerald), indigo-blue (indicolite), blue (Brazilian\r\nsapphire), yellowish green (Brazilian peridot) (Plate XXVII, Fig. 2),\r\nhoney-yellow (Ceylonese peridot), violet-red (siberite), and brown\r\n(Plate XXVII, Fig. 8). The black, opaque stones are termed schorl.\r\n\r\nThe name of the species is derived from the Ceylonese word, _turamali_,\r\nand was first employed when a parcel of gem-stones was brought to\r\nAmsterdam from Ceylon in 1703; in Ceylon, however, the term is applied\r\nby native jewellers to the yellow zircon commonly found in the island.\r\nSchorl, the derivation of which is unknown, is the ancient name for the\r\nspecies, and is still used in that sense by miners, but it has been\r\nrestricted by science to the black variety. The ‘Brazilian emerald’\r\nwas introduced into Europe in the seventeenth century and was not\r\nfavourably received, possibly because the stones were too dark in\r\ncolour and were not properly cut; that they should have been confused\r\nwith the true emerald is eloquent testimony to the extreme ignorance\r\nof the characters of gem-stones prevalent in those dark ages. Achroite\r\ncomes from the Greek, ἄχροος, without colour.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 77.—Tourmaline Crystal.]\r\n\r\nTo the crystallographer tourmaline is one of the most interesting of\r\nminerals. If the crystals, which are usually prismatic in form, are\r\ndoubly terminated, the development is so obviously different at the\r\ntwo ends (Fig. 77) as to indicate that directional character in the\r\nmolecular arrangement, termed the polarity, which is borne out by other\r\nphysical properties. Tourmaline is remarkably dichroic, A brown stone,\r\nexcept in very thin sections, is practically opaque to the ordinary\r\nray, and consequently a section cut parallel to the crystallographic\r\naxis, _i.e._ to the length of a crystal prismatically developed,\r\ntransmits only the extraordinary ray. Such sections were in use for\r\nyielding plane-polarized light before Nicol devised the calcite prism\r\nknown by his name (cf. p. 44). It is evident that tourmaline, unless\r\nvery light in tint, must be cut with the table facet parallel to that\r\naxis, because otherwise the stone will appear dark and lifeless. The\r\nvalues of the extraordinary and ordinary refractive indices range\r\nbetween 1·614 and 1·638, and 1·633 and 1·669 respectively; the double\r\nrefraction, therefore, is fairly large, amounting to 0·025, and,\r\nsince the ordinary exceeds the extraordinary ray, its character is\r\nnegative. The specific gravity varies from 3·0 to 3·2. The lower values\r\nin both characters correspond to the lighter coloured stones used in\r\njewellery; the black stones, as might be expected from their relative\r\nrichness in iron, are the densest. The hardness is only about the same\r\nas that of quartz, or perhaps a little greater, varying from 7 to 7½.\r\nIt will be noticed that the range of refractivity overlaps that of\r\ntopaz (_q.v._) but the latter has a much smaller double refraction,\r\nand may thus be distinguished (p. 29). Unmounted stones are still more\r\neasily distinguished, because tourmaline floats in methylene iodide,\r\nwhile topaz sinks. The pyro-electric phenomenon (cf. p. 82) for which\r\ntourmaline is remarkable, although of little value as a test in the\r\ncase of a cut stone, is of great scientific interest, because it is\r\nstrong evidence of the peculiar crystalline symmetry pertaining to its\r\nmolecular arrangement. Tourmalines range in price from 5s. to 20s. a\r\ncarat according to their colour and quality, but exceptional stones may\r\ncommand a higher rate.\r\n\r\nTourmaline is usually found in the pegmatite dykes of granites, but\r\nit also occurs in schists and in crystalline limestones. Rubellite\r\nis generally associated with the lithia mica, lepidolite; the groups\r\nof delicate pink rubellite bespangling a background of greyish\r\nwhite lepidolite are among the most beautiful of museum specimens.\r\nMagnificent crystals of pink, blue, and green tourmaline have been\r\nfound in the neighbourhood of Ekaterinburg, principally at Mursinka, in\r\nthe Urals, Russia, and fine rubellite has come from the Urulga River,\r\nand other spots near Nertschinsk, Transbaikal, Asiatic Russia. Elba\r\nproduces pink, yellowish, and green stones, frequently particoloured;\r\nsometimes the crystals are blackened at the top, and are then known\r\nlocally as ‘nigger-heads.’ Ceylon supplies small yellow stones—the\r\noriginal tourmaline—which are confused with the zircon of a similar\r\ncolour, and rubellite accompanies the ruby at Ava, Burma. Beautiful\r\ncrystals, green and red, often diversely coloured, come from various\r\nparts, such as Minas Novas and Arassuahy, of the State of Minas Geraes,\r\nBrazil. Suitable gem material has been found in numerous parts of\r\nthe United States. Paris and Hebron in Maine have produced gorgeous\r\npink and green crystals, and Auburn in the same state has supplied\r\ndeep-blue, green, and lilac stones. Fine crystals, mostly green, but\r\nalso pink and particoloured, occur in an albite quarry near the Conn\r\nRiver at Haddam Neck, Connecticut. All former localities have, however,\r\nbeen surpassed by the extraordinary abundance of superb green, and\r\nespecially pink, crystals at Pala and Mesa Grande in San Diego County,\r\nCalifornia. As elsewhere, many-hued stones are common. The latter\r\nlocality supplies the more perfectly transparent crystals. Kunz states\r\nthat two remarkable rubellite crystals were found there, one being 45\r\nmm. in length and 42 mm. in diameter, and the other 56 mm. in length\r\nand 24 mm. in diameter. Madagascar, which has proved of recent years\r\nto be rich in gem-stones, supplies green, yellow, and red stones, both\r\nuniformly tinted and particoloured, which in beauty, though perhaps not\r\nin size, bear comparison with any found elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\n                                PERIDOT\r\n\r\n\r\nThe beautiful bottle-green stone, which from its delicate tint has\r\nearned from appreciative admirers the poetical _sobriquet_ of the\r\nevening emerald, and which has during recent years crept into popular\r\nfavour and now graces much of the more artistic jewellery, is named\r\nas a gem-stone peridot—a word long in use among French jewellers, the\r\norigin and meaning of which has been forgotten—but is known to science\r\neither as olivine, on account of the olive-green colour sometimes\r\ncharacterizing it, or as chrysolite. It is of interest to note that the\r\nlast word, derived from χρυσός, golden, and λίθος, stone, was in use at\r\nthe time of Pliny, but was employed for topaz and other yellow stones,\r\nwhile his topaz, curiously enough, designated the modern peridot (cf.\r\np. 199), an inversion that has occurred in other words. The true\r\nolivine must not be confused with the jewellers’ ‘olivine,’ which is a\r\ngreen garnet from the Ural Mountains (p. 217). Peridot is comparatively\r\nsoft, the hardness varying from 6½ to 7 on Mohs’s scale, and is\r\nsuitable only for articles which are not likely to be scratched; the\r\npolish of a peridot worn in a ring would soon deteriorate. The choicest\r\nstones are in colour a lovely bottle-green (Plate XXIX, Fig. 2) of\r\nvarious depths; the olive-green stones (Plate XXIX, Fig. 3) cannot\r\ncompare with their sisters in attractiveness. The step form of cutting\r\nis considered the best for peridot, but it is sometimes cut round or\r\noval in shape, with brilliant-cut fronts.\r\n\r\nPeridot is a silicate of magnesium and iron, corresponding to the\r\nformula (Mg,Fe)_{2}SiO_{4}, ferrous iron, therefore, replacing\r\nmagnesia. To the ferrous iron it is indebted for its colour, the\r\npure magnesium silicate being almost colourless, and the olive tint\r\narises from the oxidation of the iron. The latitude in the composition\r\nresulting from this replacement is evinced in the considerable range\r\nthat has been observed in the physical characters, but the crystalline\r\nsymmetry persists unaltered; the lower values correspond to the stones\r\nthat are usually met with as gems. Peridot belongs to the orthorhombic\r\nsystem of crystalline symmetry, and the crystals, which display a\r\nlarge number of faces, are prismatic in form and generally somewhat\r\nflattened. The stones, however, that come into the market for cutting\r\nas gems are rarely unbroken. The dichroism is rather faint, one of the\r\ntwin colours being slightly more yellowish than the other, but it is\r\nmore pronounced in the olive-tinted stones. The values of the least\r\nand greatest of the principal indices of refraction vary greatly,\r\nfrom 1·650 and 1·683 to 1·668 and 1·701, but the double refraction,\r\namounting to 0·033, remains unaffected. Peridot, though surpassed by\r\nsphene in extent of double refraction, easily excels all the ordinary\r\ngem-stones in this respect, and this character is readily recognizable\r\nin a cut stone by the apparent doubling of the opposite edges when\r\nviewed through the table facet (cf. p. 41). An equally large\r\nvariation occurs in the specific gravity, namely, from 3·3 to 3·5.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PLATE XXVII_\r\n\r\n   1. RUBELLITE\r\n   2. TOURMALINE\r\n   3. BALAS-RUBY\r\n   4.

The rate per carat\r\nmay be very much larger for stones of exceptional size and quality.\r\n\r\nOlivine, to use the ordinary mineralogical term, is a common and\r\nimportant constituent of certain kinds of igneous rocks, and it is\r\nalso found in those strange bodies, meteorites, which come to us\r\nfrom outer cosmical space. Except in basaltic lavas, it occurs in\r\ngrains and rarely in well-shaped crystals. Stones that are large and\r\ntransparent enough for cutting purposes come almost entirely from the\r\nisland Zebirget or St. John situated on the west coast of the Red Sea,\r\nopposite to the port of Berenice. This island belongs to the Khedive of\r\nEgypt, and is at present leased to a French syndicate. It is believed\r\nto be the same as the mysterious island which produced the ‘topaz’\r\nof Pliny’s time. Magnificent stones have been discovered here, rich\r\ngreen in colour, and 20 to 30, and occasionally as much as 80, carats\r\nin weight when cut; a rough mass attained to the large weight of 190\r\ncarats. Pretty, light-green stones are supplied by Queensland, and\r\nperidots of a less pleasing dark-yellowish shade of green, and without\r\nany sign of crystal form, have during recent years come from North\r\nAmerica. Stones rather similar to those from Queensland have latterly\r\nbeen found in the Bernardino Valley in Upper Burma, not far from the\r\nruby mines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\n                                ZIRCON\r\n\r\n                  (_Jargoon_, _Hyacinth_, _Jacinth_)\r\n\r\n\r\nZircon, which, if known at all in jewellery, is called by its variety\r\nnames, jargoon and hyacinth or jacinth, is a species that deserves\r\ngreater recognition than it receives. The colourless stones rival\r\neven diamond in splendour of brilliance and display of ‘fire’; the\r\nleaf-green stones (Plate XXIX, Fig. 13) possess a restful beauty\r\nthat commends itself; the deep-red stones (Plate XXIX, Fig. 14), if\r\nsomewhat sombre, have a certain grandeur; and no other species produces\r\nsuch magnificent stones of golden-yellow hue (Plate XXIX, Fig. 12).\r\nZircon is well known in Ceylon, which supplies the world with the\r\nfinest specimens, and is highly appreciated by the inhabitants of that\r\nsunny isle, but it scarcely finds a place in jewellery elsewhere. The\r\ncolourless stones are cut as brilliants, but brilliant-cut fronts with\r\nstep-cut backs is the usual style adopted for the coloured stones.\r\n\r\nZircon is a silicate of zirconium corresponding to the formula\r\nZrSiO_{4}, but uranium and the rare earths are generally present in\r\nsmall quantities. The aurora-red variety is known as hyacinth or\r\njacinth, and the term jargoon is applied to the other transparent\r\nvarieties, and especially to the yellow stones. The most attractive\r\ncolours shown by zircon are leaf-green, golden-yellow, and deep red.\r\nOther common colours are brown, greenish, and sky-blue. Colourless\r\nstones are not found in nature, but result from the application of heat\r\nto the yellow and brown stones.\r\n\r\nThe name of the species is ancient, and comes from the Arabic _zarqūn_,\r\nvermilion, or the Persian _zarqūn_, gold-coloured. From the same\r\nsource in all probability is derived the word jargoon through the\r\nFrench _jargon_ and the Italian _giacone_. Hyacinth (cf. p. 211) is\r\ntransliterated from the Greek ὑάκινθος, itself adapted from an old\r\nIndian word; it is in no way connected with the flower of the same\r\nname. The last word has seen some changes of meaning. In Pliny’s time\r\nyellow zircons were indiscriminately classified with other yellow\r\nstones as chrysolite. His hyacinth was used for the sapphire of the\r\npresent day, but was subsequently applied to any transparent corundum.\r\nUpon the introduction of the terms, sapphire and ruby, for the blue and\r\nthe red corundum hyacinth became restricted to the other varieties, of\r\nwhich the yellow was the commonest. In the darkness of the Middle Ages\r\nit was loosely employed for all yellow stones emanating from India,\r\nand was finally, with increasing discernment in the characters of\r\ngem-stones, assigned to the yellow zircon, since it was the commonest\r\nyellow stone from India.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 78.—Zircon Crystal.]\r\n\r\nConsidered from the scientific point of view, zircon is by far the most\r\ninteresting and the most remarkable of the gem-stones. The problem\r\npresented by its characters and constitution is one that still awaits\r\na satisfactory solution. Certain zircons, which are found as rolled\r\npebbles in Ceylon and never show any trace of crystalline faces, have\r\nvery nearly single refraction, and the values of the refractive index\r\nvary from 1·790 to 1·840, and the specific gravity is about 4·00 to\r\n4·14, and the hardness is slightly greater than that of quartz, being\r\nabout 7¼. On the other hand, such stones as the red zircons from\r\nExpailly have remarkably different properties. They show crystalline\r\nfaces with tetragonal symmetry, the faces present being four prismatic\r\nfaces mutually intersecting at right angles and four inclined faces at\r\neach end (Fig. 78). They have large double refraction, varying from\r\n0·044 to 0·062, which is readily discerned in a cut stone (cf. p.\r\n41), and the refractive indices are high, the ordinary index varying\r\nfrom 1·923 to 1·931 and the extraordinary from 1·967 to 1·993. Since\r\nthe ordinary is less than the extraordinary index the sign of the\r\ndouble refraction is positive. The specific gravity likewise is much\r\nhigher, varying from 4·67 to 4·71. The second type, therefore, sinks\r\nin molten silver-thallium nitrate, whereas the first type floats. The\r\nsecond type is also slightly harder, being about 7½ on Mohs’s scale.\r\nBy heating either of these types the physical characters are not much\r\naltered, except that the colour is weakened or entirely driven off and\r\nsome change takes place in the double refraction. But between these\r\ntwo types may be found zircons upon which the effect of heating is\r\nstriking. They seem to contract in size so that the specific gravity\r\nincreases as much as three units in the first place of decimals, and a\r\ncorresponding increase takes place in the refractive indices, and in\r\nthe amount of double refraction. The cause of these changes remains a\r\nmatter of speculation. Evidently a third type of zircon exists which\r\nis capable of most intimate association with either of the other\r\ntypes, and which is very susceptible to the effect of heat. It may be\r\nnoted that stones of the intermediate type are usually characterized\r\nby a banded or zonal structure suggesting a want of homogeneity. The\r\ntheory has been advanced that zircon contains an unknown element which\r\nhas not yet been separated from zirconium. Zircon of the first type\r\nfavours green, sky-blue, and golden-yellow colours; honey-yellow, light\r\ngreen, blue, and red colours characterize the second type; and the\r\nintermediate stones are mostly yellowish green, cloudy blue, and green.\r\n\r\nIt is another peculiarity of zircon that it sometimes shows in the\r\nspectroscope absorption bands (p. 61), which were observed in 1866 by\r\nChurch. Many zircons do not exhibit the bands at all, and others only\r\ndisplay the two prominent bands in the red end of the spectrum.\r\n\r\nOf all the gem-stones zircon alone approaches diamond in brilliance of\r\nlustre, and it also possesses considerable ‘fire’; it can, of course,\r\nbe readily distinguished by its inferior hardness, but a judgment based\r\nmerely on inspection by eye might easily be erroneous.\r\n\r\nAccording to Church, who has made a lifelong study of zircon, the green\r\nand yellowish stones of the first variety emit a brilliant orange light\r\nwhen being ground on a copper wheel charged with diamond dust, and\r\nthe golden stones of the intermediate type glow with a fine orange\r\nincandescence in the flame of a bunsen burner; the latter phenomenon is\r\nsupposed to be due to the presence of thoria.\r\n\r\nThe leaf-green stones almost invariably show a series of parallel bands\r\nin the interior.\r\n\r\nZircons vary from 5s. to 15s. a carat, but exceptional stones may be\r\nworth more.\r\n\r\nBy far the finest stones come from Ceylon. The colourless stones are\r\nthere known as ‘Matura diamonds,’ and the hyacinth includes garnet\r\n(hessonite) of similar colour, which is found with it in the same\r\ngravels. The stones are always water-worn. Small hyacinths and deep-red\r\nstones come from Expailly, Auvergne, France, and yellowish-red crystals\r\nare found in the Ilmen Mountains, Orenburg, Russia. Remarkably fine\r\nred stones have been discovered at Mudgee, New South Wales, and\r\nyellowish-brown stones accompany diamond at the Kimberley mines, South\r\nAfrica.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\n                              CHRYSOBERYL\r\n\r\n        (_Chrysolite_, _Cat’s-Eye_, _Cymophane_, _Alexandrite_)\r\n\r\n\r\nChrysoberyl has at times enjoyed fleeting popularity on account of the\r\nexcellent cat’s-eyes cut from the fibrous stones, and in the form of\r\nalexandrite it meets with a steadier, if still limited, demand. It is a\r\ngem-stone that is seldom met with in ordinary jewellery, although its\r\nconsiderable hardness befits it for all such purposes.\r\n\r\nChrysoberyl is in composition an aluminate of beryllium corresponding\r\nto the formula BeAl_{2}O_{4}, and is therefore closely akin to spinel.\r\nIt usually contains some ferric and chromic oxides in place of alumina,\r\nand ferrous oxide in place of beryllia, and it is to these accessory\r\nconstituents that its tints are due. Other gem-stones containing the\r\nuncommon element beryllium are phenakite and beryl. Pale yellowish\r\ngreen, the commonest colour, is supposed to be caused by ferrous\r\noxide; such stones are known to jewellers as chrysolite (Plate XXVII,\r\nFig. 12). Cat’s-eyes (Plate XXIX, Fig. 1) have often also a brownish\r\nshade of green. The bluish green and dark olive-green stones known\r\nas alexandrite (Plate XXVII, Figs. 11, 13) differ in appearance so\r\nmarkedly from their fairer sisters that their common parentage seems\r\nalmost incredible. The dull fires that glow within them, and the\r\ncurious change that comes over them at night, add a touch of mystery to\r\nthese dark stones. Chromic oxide is held responsible for their colour.\r\nThe cat’s-eyes are, of course, always cut _en cabochon_, but otherwise\r\nchrysoberyl is faceted.\r\n\r\nThe name of the species is composed of two Greek words, χρυσός, golden,\r\nand βήρυλλος, beryl, and etymologically more correctly defines the\r\nlighter-coloured stones, which were, indeed, at one time the only kind\r\nknown. Chrysolite from χρυσὁς, golden, and λίθος, stone, has much the\r\nsame significance. This name is preferred by jewellers, but in science\r\nit is applied to an entirely different species, which is known in\r\njewellery as peridot. Cymophane, from κῦμα, wave, and φαίνειν, appear,\r\nrefers to the peculiar opalescence characteristic of cat’s-eyes; it\r\nis sometimes used to designate these stones, but does not find a\r\nplace within the vocabulary of jewellery. Alexandrite is named after\r\nAlexander II, Czar of Russia, because it first came to light on his\r\nbirthday. That circumstance, coupled with its display of the national\r\ncolours, green and red, and its at one time restriction to the mining\r\ndistrict near Ekaterinburg, renders it dear to the heart of all loyal\r\nRussians.\r\n\r\nChrysoberyl crystallizes in the orthorhombic system, and occurs in\r\nrather dull, complex crystals, which are sometimes so remarkably\r\ntwinned, especially in the variety called alexandrite, as to simulate\r\nhexagonal crystals. In keeping with the crystalline symmetry it\r\nis doubly refractive and biaxial, having two directions of single\r\nrefraction. The least and the greatest of the principal indices of\r\nrefraction may have any values between 1·742 and 1·749, and 1·750 and\r\n1·757, respectively, the maximum amount of double refraction remaining\r\nalways the same, namely, 0·009. The mean principal refractive index\r\nis close to the least; the sign of the double refraction is therefore\r\npositive, and the shadow-edge corresponding to the lower index, as\r\nseen in the refractometer, has little, if any, perceptible motion\r\nwhen the stone is rotated. The converse is the case with corundum;\r\nthe sign is negative, and it is the shadow-edge corresponding to the\r\ngreater refractive index that remains unaltered in position on rotation\r\nof the stone. This test would suffice to separate chrysoberyl from\r\nyellow corundum, even if the refractive indices of the former were\r\nnot sensibly lower than those of the latter. Also, the dichroism of\r\nchrysolite is stronger than that of yellow sapphires. In alexandrite\r\nthis phenomenon is most prominent; the absorptive tints, columbine-red,\r\norange, and emerald-green, corresponding to the three principal\r\noptical directions, are in striking contrast, and the first differs\r\nso much from the intrinsic colour of the stone as to be obvious to\r\nthe unaided eye, and is the cause of the red tints visible in a cut\r\nstone. The curious change in colour of alexandrite, from leaf-green to\r\nraspberry-red, that takes place when the stone is seen by artificial\r\nlight, is due to a different cause, as has been pointed out above (p.\r\n54). The effect is illustrated by Figs. 11, 13 on Plate XXVII, which\r\nrepresent a fine Ceylon stone as seen by daylight and artificial light;\r\nthe influence of dichroism may be noticed in the former picture. The\r\nspecific gravity of chrysoberyl varies from 3·68 to 3·78. In hardness\r\nthis species ranks above spinel and comes next to corundum, being\r\ngiven the symbol 8½ on Mohs’s scale. Certain stones contain a multitude\r\nof microscopic channels arranged in parallel position. When the stones\r\nare cut with their rounded surface parallel to the channels, a broadish\r\nband of light is visible running across the stone at right angles\r\nto them, and suggests the pupil of a cat’s eye, whence the common\r\nname for the stones. The fact that the channels are hollow causes an\r\nopalescence, which is absent from the quartz cat’s-eye.\r\n\r\nThe most important locality for the yellowish chrysoberyl is the rich\r\ndistrict of Minas Novas, Minas Geraes, Brazil, where it occurs in the\r\nform of pebbles, and excellent material is also supplied by Ceylon,\r\nin both crystals and rounded pebbles. Other places for chrysolite are\r\nHaddam, Connecticut, and Greenfield, Saratoga County, New York, in\r\nthe United States, and recently in the gem-gravels near the Somabula\r\nForest, Rhodesia. Ceylon supplies some of the best cat’s-eyes.\r\nAlexandrite was first discovered, as already stated, at the emerald\r\nmines near Ekaterinburg, in the Urals; but the supply is now nearly\r\nexhausted. A poorer quality comes from Takowaja, also in the Urals.\r\nGood alexandrite has come to light in Ceylon, and most of the stones\r\nthat are placed on the market at the present day have emanated from\r\nthat island. The Ceylon stones reach a considerable size, often as much\r\nas from 10 to 20 carats in weight; the Russian stones have a better\r\ncolour and are more beautiful, but they are less transparent, and\r\nrarely exceed a carat in weight. Good chrysolite may be worth from 10s.\r\nto £2 a carat, and cat’s-eye runs from £1 to £4 a carat, depending\r\nupon the quality. Alexandrites meet with a steady demand in Russia, and\r\nfine stones are scarce; flawless stones about a carat in weight are\r\nworth as much as £30 a carat, and even quite ordinary stones fetch £4 a\r\ncarat.\r\n\r\nFrom Ceylon, that interesting home of gems, have originated some\r\nmagnificent chrysoberyls, including a superb chrysolite, 80¾ carats\r\nin weight, and another, a splendid brownish yellow in colour and\r\nvery even in tint, and two large alexandrites, green in daylight and\r\na rich red by night, weighing 63⅜ and 28-23/32 carats. The finest\r\ncut chrysolite existing is probably the one exhibited in the Mineral\r\nGallery of the British Museum (Natural History). Absolutely flawless\r\nand weighing 43¾ carats, it was formerly contained in the famous Hope\r\ncollection, and is described on page 56 and figured on Plate XXI of\r\nthe catalogue prepared by B. Hertz, which was published in 1839; the\r\nweight there given includes the brilliants and the ring in which it\r\nwas mounted. It is shown, about actual size, in Plate XXVII, Fig. 12.\r\nA magnificent cat’s-eye, 35·5 by 35 mm. in size, which also formed\r\npart of the Hope collection, was included in the crown jewels taken\r\nfrom the King of Kandy in 1815. The crystalline markings in the cut\r\nstone are so arranged that the lower half shows an altar overhung by a\r\ntorch. The stone has been famous in Ceylon for many ages. It was set\r\nin gold with rubies cut _en cabochon_. Two fine Ceylon alexandrites of\r\nexceptional merit, weighing 42 and 26¾ carats, are also exhibited in\r\nthe Mineral Gallery of the British Museum (Natural History). The former\r\nis illustrated in Plate XXVII, Figs. 11, 13, as seen in daylight and in\r\nartificial light.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\n                                QUARTZ\r\n\r\n   (_Rock-Crystal_, _Amethyst_, _Citrine_, _Cairngorm_, _Cat’s-Eye_,\r\n                            _Tiger’s-Eye_)\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough the commonest and, in its natural form, the most easily\r\nrecognizable of mineral substances, quartz nevertheless holds a not\r\ninconspicuous position among gem-stones, because, as amethyst (Plate\r\nXXVII, Fig. 7), it provides stones of the finest violet colour;\r\nmoreover, the yellow quartz (Plate XXVII, Fig. 5) so ably vies with the\r\ntrue topaz that it is universally known to jewellers by the name of the\r\nlatter species, and is too often confounded with it, and the lustrous,\r\nlimpid rock-crystal even aspires to the local title of ‘diamond.’\r\nFor all purposes where a violet or yellow stone is required, quartz\r\nis admirably suited; it is hard and durable, and it has the merit,\r\nor possibly to some minds the drawback, of being moderate in price.\r\nDespite its comparative lack of ‘fire,’ rock-crystal might replace\r\npaste in rings and buckles with considerable advantage from the point\r\nof view of durability. The chatoyant quartz, especially in the form\r\nknown as tiger’s-eye, will for beauty bear comparison with the true\r\ncat’s-eye, which is a variety of chrysoberyl. Except that cat’s-eye is\r\ncut _en cabochon_, quartz is step- or sometimes brilliant-cut.\r\n\r\nRanking with corundum next to diamond as the simplest in composition\r\nof the gem-stones, quartz is the crystallized form of silica, oxide\r\nof silicon, corresponding to the formula SiO_{2}. When pure, it\r\nis entirely devoid of the faintest trace of colour and absolutely\r\nwater-clear. Such stones are called rock-crystal, and it is easy to\r\nunderstand why in early days it was supposed to represent a form\r\nof petrified water. It is these brilliant, transparent stones that\r\nare, when small, known in many localities as ‘diamonds.’ Before\r\nthe manufacture of glass was discovered and brought to perfection,\r\nrock-crystal was in considerable use for fashioning into cups, vases,\r\nand so forth. The beautiful tints characterizing quartz are due to the\r\nusual metallic oxides. To manganese is given the credit of the superb\r\npurple or violet colour of amethyst, which varies considerably in\r\ndepth. Jewellers are inclined to distinguish the deep-coloured stones\r\nwith the prefix ‘oriental,’ but the practice is to be deprecated, since\r\nit might lead to confusion with the true oriental amethyst, which is\r\na purple sapphire, one of the rarest varieties of corundum. Quartz\r\nof a yellow hue is properly called citrine, but, as already stated,\r\njewellers habitually prefer the name ‘topaz’ for it, and distinguish\r\nthe true topaz by the prefix Brazilian—not a very happy term, since\r\nboth the yellow topaz and the yellow quartz occur plentifully in\r\nBrazil. Sometimes the yellow quartz is termed occidental, Spanish,\r\nor false topaz. Stones with a brownish or smoky tinge of yellow are\r\ncalled cairngorm, or Scotch topaz. The colour of the yellow stones\r\nis doubtless due to a trace of ferric oxide. Stones of a smoky brown\r\ncolour are known as smoky-quartz. Rose-quartz, which is rose-red or\r\npink in colour and hazy in texture, is comparatively rare; strange\r\nto say, it has never been found in distinct crystals. The tint,\r\nwhich may be due to titanium, is fugitive, and fades on exposure to\r\nstrong sunlight. In milky quartz, as the name suggests, the interior\r\nis so hazy as to impart to the stone a milky appearance. It has\r\nfrequently happened that quartz has crystallized after the formation\r\nof other minerals, with the result that the latter are found inside\r\nit. Prase, or mother-of-emerald, which at one time was supposed to\r\nbe the mother-rock of emerald, is a quartz coloured leek-green by\r\nactinolite fibres in the interior. Specimens containing hair-like\r\nfibres of rutile—the so-called _flêches d’amour_—are common in mineral\r\ncollections, and are sometimes to be seen worked. When enclosing a\r\nmassive, light-coloured, fibrous mineral, the stones have a chatoyant\r\neffect, and display, when suitably cut, a fine cat’s-eye effect; in\r\ntiger’s-eye the enclosed mineral is crocidolite, an asbestos, the\r\noriginal blue hue of which has been changed to a fine golden-brown\r\nby oxidation. Quartz which contains scales of mica, hematite, or\r\nother flaky mineral has a vivid spangled appearance, and is known\r\nas aventurine; it has occasionally been employed for brooches or\r\nsimilar articles of jewellery. Rainbow-quartz, or iris, is a quartz\r\nwhich contains cracks, the chromatic effect being the result of the\r\ninterference of light reflected from them; it has been artificially\r\nproduced by heating the stone and suddenly cooling it.\r\n\r\nThe name of the species is an old German mining term of unknown\r\nmeaning which has been in general use in all languages since the\r\nsixteenth century. Amethyst is derived from ἀμέθυστος, not drunken,\r\npossibly from a foolish notion that the wearer was exempt from the\r\nusual consequences of unrestrained libations. Pliny suggests as an\r\nalternative explanation that its colour approximates to, but does not\r\nquite reach, that of wine. Aventurine, from _aventura_, an accident,\r\nwas first applied to glass spangled with copper, the effect being\r\nsaid to have been accidentally discovered owing to a number of copper\r\nfilings falling into a pot of molten glass in a Venetian factory.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 79.—Quartz Crystal.]\r\n\r\nQuartz belongs to the hexagonal system of crystalline symmetry,\r\nand crystallizes in the familiar six-sided prisms terminated by\r\nsix inclined, often triangular, faces (Fig. 79); twins are common,\r\nthough they are not always obvious from the outward development. In\r\naccordance with the symmetry the refraction is double, and there is one\r\ndirection of single refraction, namely, that parallel to the edge of\r\nthe prism. The ordinary refractive index has the value 1·544, and the\r\nextraordinary 1·553, and since the latter is the greater, the sign of\r\nthe double refraction is positive. The double refraction is small in\r\namount, but is large enough to enable the apparent doubling of certain\r\nof the opposite edges of a faceted stone to be perceptible when viewed\r\nwith a lens through the table-facet. The dichroism of the deep-coloured\r\nstones is quite distinct. Quartz has only about the same amount of\r\ncolour dispersion as ordinary glass, and lacks, therefore, ‘fire.’\r\nThe application of strong heat tends, as usual, to weaken or drive\r\noff the colour. Thus the dense smoky-quartz found in Spain, Brazil,\r\nand elsewhere is converted into stones of a colour varying from light\r\nyellow to reddish brown according to the amount and duration of the\r\napplication. In the case of amethyst the colour is changed to a deep\r\norange, or entirely driven off if the temperature be high enough. Its\r\ndensity is very constant, varying only from 2·654 to 2·660; the purest\r\nstones are the lightest. To it has been assigned the symbol 7 on Mohs’s\r\nscale of hardness.\r\n\r\nTo physicists quartz is one of the most interesting of minerals because\r\nof its power of rotating, to an extent depending upon the thickness of\r\nthe section, the plane of polarization of a beam of light traversing it\r\nin a direction parallel to the prism edge. It appears, moreover, from\r\na study of the pyro-electric and general physical characters, that its\r\nmolecular structure has a helical arrangement, which, like all screws,\r\nmay have a right- or left-handed character. Amethyst is, in fact,\r\ninvariably composed of separate twin individuals, alternately right-\r\nand left-handed; in some remarkable crystals the section at right\r\nangles to the prism edge is composed of triangular sectors, alternately\r\nof different hands and of different tints—purple and white. To the\r\ntwinning is due the rippled fracture and the feathery inclusions so\r\ncharacteristic of amethyst.\r\n\r\nBesides its use for ornamental purposes, quartz finds a place as the\r\nmaterial for lenses intended for delicate photographic work, because\r\nits transparency to the ultra-violet light is so much greater than\r\nthat of glass. Spectacle lenses made of it are in demand, because they\r\nare not liable to scratches, and retain, therefore, their polish\r\nindefinitely. When fused in the oxyhydrogen flame, quartz becomes a\r\nsilica glass, of specific gravity 2·2 and hardness 5 on Mohs’s scale,\r\nwhich has proved of great service for laboratory ware, because it\r\nwithstands sudden and unequal heating without any danger of fracture;\r\nit has also in fine threads been invaluable for delicate torsion work,\r\nbecause it acquires not the smallest amount of permanent twist, in this\r\nrespect being superior to the finest silk threads.\r\n\r\nClear rock-crystal fetches little more than the cost of the cutting;\r\ncitrine and amethyst are worth from 1s. to 5s. a carat, depending\r\nupon the quality and size of the stone; smoky-quartz is practically\r\nvalueless; rose-quartz realizes less than 1s. a carat; and the value\r\nof cat’s-eye is also small—only 1s. to 2s. 6d. a carat. Tiger’s-eye at\r\none time commanded as much as 25s. a carat, but the supply exceeded the\r\ndemand, with the consequent collapse in the price.\r\n\r\nBeautiful, brilliant, and limpid rock-crystal is found in various parts\r\nof the world: in the Swiss Alps, at Bourg d’Oisans in the Dauphiné\r\nAlps, France, in the famous Carrara marble, in the Marmaros Comitat\r\nof Hungary, and in the United States, Brazil, Madagascar, and Japan.\r\nSmall lustrous stones, known in their localities as ‘Isle of Wight,’\r\n‘Cornish,’ or ‘Bristol diamonds,’ are found in our own country. Brazil\r\nsupplies stones out of which have been cut the clear balls used in\r\ncrystal-gazing. The finest amethysts come from Brazil—especially the\r\nState of Rio Grande do Sul—and from Uruguay, India, and the gem-gravels\r\nof Ceylon; good stones also occur at Ekaterinburg, in the Ural\r\nMountains. A splendid Brazilian amethyst, weighing 334 carats, and\r\ntwo Russian stones—one hexagonal in contour, weighing 88 carats, and\r\nthe other, a deep purple in colour with a circular table, weighing 73\r\ncarats—are exhibited in the British Museum (Natural History). Cairngorm\r\nis known from the place of that name in Banffshire, Scotland, whence\r\nfine specimens have emanated; it is a gem much valued in that country.\r\nFine cairngorm has also originated from Pike’s Peak, Colorado. Splendid\r\nyellow stones have had their birth in the States of Minas Geraes, São\r\nPaulo, and Goyãz, of Brazil—especially in the last. The fine Spanish\r\nsmoky-quartz, which, as already stated, turns yellow on heating, comes\r\nfrom Hinojosa, in the Province of Cordova. The delicate rose-quartz\r\nis known at Bodenmais in Bavaria, Paris in Maine, United States, and\r\nEkaterinburg in the Ural Mountains. The finest cat’s-eyes are found in\r\nIndia and Ceylon, and are high in favour with the natives. Greenish\r\nstones of an inferior quality are brought from the Fichtelgebirge in\r\nBavaria, and are sold as ‘Hungarian cat’s-eyes,’ despite the fact\r\nthat no such stone occurs in Hungary—another instance of jewellers’\r\ndisdain for accuracy. Tiger’s-eye occurs in considerable quantity in\r\nthe neighbourhood of Griquatown, Griqualand West, South Africa. A\r\nsilicified crocidolite, in which the blue colour is retained, comes\r\nalso from Salzburg, and is known as sapphire- or azure-quartz, or\r\nsiderite.\r\n\r\nCertain of the pebbles found on the seashore of our coasts, especially\r\noff the Isle of Wight and North Wales, cut into attractive, clear\r\nstones, more or less yellow in colour; but examples suitable for the\r\npurpose are not so numerous as might be supposed, and do not reward any\r\ncasual search. _Les affaires sont les affaires._ The local lapidary,\r\ninstead of explaining that the pebbles brought to him are not worth\r\ncutting, finds it more convenient and profitable to substitute for\r\nthem other, inferior and badly cut, stones, bought by the gross, or\r\neven paste stones; the customer, on the other hand, is contented with\r\na pretty bauble, and is not grateful for the information that it might\r\nhave been obtained for a fraction of the sum paid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\n                        CHALCEDONY, AGATE, ETC.\r\n\r\n\r\nChalcedony and agate, and their endless varieties, are composed\r\nmainly of silica, but the separate individual crystals are so small\r\nas to be invisible to the unaided eyesight, and occasionally are\r\nso extremely minute that the structure is almost amorphous. The\r\ncolour and appearance vary greatly, depending upon the impurities\r\ncontained in the stone, and, since both have been made a criterion for\r\ndifferentiation of types, a host of names have come into use, none of\r\nwhich are susceptible of strict definition. On the whole, these stones\r\nmay be divided into two groups: chalcedony, in which the structure is\r\nconcretionary and the colour comparatively uniform, and agate, in which\r\nthe arrangement takes the form of bands, varying greatly in tint and\r\ncolour.\r\n\r\nThe refraction, though double in the individual, is irregular over the\r\nstone as a whole, and the indices approximate to 1·550. The specific\r\ngravity ranges from 2·62 to 2·64, depending upon the impurities\r\npresent. The degree of hardness is about the same as that of quartz,\r\nnamely, 7 on Mohs’s scale. All kinds are more or less porous, and\r\nstones of a dull colour are therefore artificially tinted after being\r\nworked.\r\n\r\nThe term chalcedony, derived from χαλκηδών the name of a town in\r\nAsia Minor, is usually confined to stones of a greyish tinge. Stones\r\nartificially coloured an emerald green have been cut and put upon\r\nthe market as ‘emeraldine.’ Carnelian is a clear red chalcedony,\r\nand sard is somewhat similar, but brownish in tint. Chrysoprase is\r\napple-green in colour, nickel oxide being supposed to be the agent.\r\nPrase (cf. p. 240), which is a dull leek-green in hue, may also in\r\npart be referred here; the name comes from πράσμον, a leek. Plasma,\r\nwhich may have the same derivation, is a brighter leek-green. Jasper\r\nis a chalcedony coloured blood-red by iron oxide, while bloodstone is\r\na green chalcedony spotted with jasper; they are popular stones for\r\nsignet rings. Flint, an opaque chalcedony, breaks with a sharp cutting\r\nedge, and was much in request with early man as a tool or a weapon; its\r\nproperty of giving sparks when struck with steel rendered it invaluable\r\nbefore the invention of matches. Hornstone is somewhat similar, but\r\nmore brittle, while chert is a flinty rock.\r\n\r\nAgate, named after the river Achates in Sicily, where it was found at\r\nthe time of Theophrastus, has a peculiar banded structure, the bands\r\nbeing usually irregular in shape, following the configuration of the\r\ncavity in which it was formed. Moss-agate, or mocha-stone, contains\r\nmoss-like inclusions of some fibrous mineral. Onyx is an agate with\r\nregular bands, the layers having sharply different colours; when black\r\nand white, it has, in days gone by, been employed for cameos. Sardonyx\r\nis similar in structure, but red and white in colour. Agate is used in\r\ndelicate balances for supporting the steel knife-edges of the balance\r\nitself and of the panholders, and is largely employed—especially when\r\nartificially coloured—for umbrella handles and similar articles.\r\n\r\nChalcedony and agate are found the whole world over, but India, and\r\nparticularly Brazil, are noted for their fine carnelians and agates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\n                                 OPAL\r\n\r\n               (_White Opal_, _Black Opal_, _Fire-Opal_)\r\n\r\n\r\nThat opal in early times excited keen admiration is evident from\r\nPliny’s enthusiastic description of these stones: “For in them you\r\nshall see the burning fire of the carbuncle, the glorious purple of the\r\namethyst, the green sea of the emerald, all glittering together in an\r\nincredible mixture of light.” During much of last century, owing to the\r\nfoolish superstition that ill-luck dogs the footsteps of the wearer,\r\nthe species lay under a cloud, which has even now not quite dispersed,\r\nbut exercises a prejudicial effect upon the fortunes of the stone. It\r\nhas, however, recently attracted considerable attention owing to the\r\ndiscovery of the splendid black opals in Australia; at one moment black\r\nwith the darkness of night, at the next by a chance movement glowing\r\nwith vivid crimson flame, such stones may justly be considered the most\r\nremarkable in modern jewellery. At the present day opal is divided by\r\njewellers roughly into two main groups: ‘white’ (Plate XXVII, Fig. 6)\r\nand ‘black’ (Plate XXVII, Fig. 9), according as the tint is light or\r\ndark, fire-opal (Plate XXVII, Fig. 10) standing in a separate category.\r\n\r\nOpal differs from the rest of the principal gem-stones in being\r\nnot a crystalline body, but a solidified jelly, and it depends for\r\nits attractiveness upon the characteristic play of colour, known,\r\nin consequence, as opalescence (cf. p. 39), which arises from a\r\npeculiarity in the structure. Opal is mainly silica, SiO_{2}, in\r\ncomposition, but contains in addition an amount of water varying in\r\nprecious opal from 6 to 10 per cent. As the original jelly cooled, it\r\nbecame riddled throughout with cracks, which were afterwards generally\r\nfilled with opal matter, containing a different amount of water,\r\nand therefore differing slightly in refractivity from the original\r\nsubstance. The structure not being quite homogeneous, each crack has\r\nthe same action upon light as a soap-film, and gives rise to precisely\r\nsimilar phenomena; the thinner and more uniform the cracks, the greater\r\nthe splendour of the chromatic display, the particular tint depending\r\nupon the direction in which the stone is viewed. The cracks in certain\r\nopals were not filled up, and therefore contain air. Such stones appear\r\nopaque and devoid of opalescence until plunged into water; they are\r\nconsequently known as hydrophane, from ὕδωρ, water, and φαίνεσθαι, to\r\nmake appear. Owing to the effect of total-reflection, light was stopped\r\non the hither side of the cracks before they were filled with water,\r\nwhich is not far inferior to opal in refractivity; it is surprising how\r\nmuch water these stones will absorb.\r\n\r\nOpal is colourless when pure, but is nearly always more or less milky\r\nand opaque, or tinted various dull shades by ferric oxide, magnesia\r\nor, alumina. The so-called black opal is generally a dark grey or\r\nblue, and very rarely quite black. That the coloration is not due\r\nto ordinary absorption, but to the action of cracks in the stone,\r\nis shown by the fact that the transmitted light is complementary to\r\nthe reflected light; the blue opal is, for instance, a yellow when\r\nheld up so that light has passed through it. In many black opals the\r\nopalescent material occurs in far too tiny pieces to be cut separately,\r\nand the whole iron-stained matrix is cut and polished and sold under\r\nthe name ‘opal-matrix.’ The reddish and orange-coloured stones known\r\nas fire-opal have pronounced colour and only slight milkiness; they\r\ndisplay the customary opalescence in certain directions. These stones\r\nare often faceted, but otherwise opals are cut _en cabochon_, either\r\nflat or steep—generally the former in brooches and pendants, and the\r\nlatter in rings. Opal is somewhat soft, varying from 5 to 6½ on Mohs’s\r\nscale, and is therefore easily scratched. The specific gravity ranges\r\nfrom 2·10 to 2·20, and the refractive index from 1·444 to 1·464, the\r\nrefraction, of course, being always single. It is unwise to immerse\r\nopals in liquids on account of their porosity.\r\n\r\nThe name opal comes to us through the Latin _opallus_, which was used\r\nfor the same species as understood by the term at the present day, but\r\nthe word has a far older origin, which has not been traced. The Romans\r\nalso called the mineral _pæderos_, the Greek form of Cupid, a name\r\napplied to all rosy stones. The name cacholong, for the bluish-white\r\nporcelain variety, which is very porous and adheres to the tongue, is\r\nof Tartar origin; the stone is highly valued in the East.\r\n\r\nThe oldest mines, which up to quite a recent date were the only\r\nextensive deposit of opal known, were at Cserwenitsa, near Kashau,\r\nin Hungary. From them in all probability emanated the opals known to\r\nthe Romans. The opals from this locality were generally quite small,\r\nand large pieces were rare and commanded high prices. The Hungary\r\nmines, however, proved quite unable to compete with the rich fields\r\nat White Cliffs, New South Wales, in spite of the efforts that were\r\nmade to depreciate and exclude from the market the new stones, and at\r\nthe present time few of the opals on the market come from them. As so\r\noften happens, the White Cliffs deposit was discovered by accident.\r\nIn 1889 a hunter, when tracking a wounded kangaroo, chanced to pick\r\nup an attractively coloured opal. The district is so waterless and\r\nforbidding that, but for such a chance, the opals might have long lain\r\nhidden. They occur in seams in deposits of Cretaceous Age in a variety\r\nof ways, filling cavities in rocks or sandstones, or cracks in wood, or\r\nreplacing wood, saurian bones, and some spiky mineral, which may have\r\nbeen glauberite. In recent years, another rich deposit was discovered\r\nfarther north, on both sides of the boundary between Queensland and\r\nNew South Wales. The field is remarkable for the darkness of its\r\nopals, which are called ‘black opal’ in contradistinction to the\r\nlighter-coloured stones previously known. From Lightning Ridge in\r\nNew South Wales come stones stained deep black which quite merit the\r\ndesignation black opal. The sandstone in which they are found is\r\nrich in iron, and this is no doubt responsible for the deepness of\r\ntheir tint. Mexico is noted for the fire-opal, which is found at\r\nEsperanza, Queretaro, and Zimapan; but other kinds of opal also are\r\nfound at these places.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PLATE XXVIII_\r\n\r\nOPAL MINES, WHITE CLIFFS, NEW SOUTH WALES]\r\n\r\nThe price of opal varies greatly, according to the intrinsic colour\r\nand the uniformity and brilliance of the opalescence. Common opal can\r\nbe bought at as low a rate as 1s. a carat, while black opal ranges\r\nfrom 10s. to £8 a carat; but a good dark stone displaying a flaming\r\nopalescence commands a fancy figure, fine stones of this class being\r\nexceedingly rare. Fire-opal enjoys only a limited popularity now,\r\nthough a few years ago it was in some demand; the price runs from 2s.\r\nto 10s. a carat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXXI\r\n\r\n                                FELSPAR\r\n\r\n          (_Moonstone, Sunstone, Labradorite, Amazon-Stone_)\r\n\r\n\r\nThough second to none among minerals in scientific interest, whether\r\nregarded from the point of view of their crystalline characters or\r\nthe important part they play in the formation of rocks, the group\r\nincluded under the general name felspar occupies but a humble place\r\nin jewellery. It consists of three distinct species, orthoclase,\r\nalbite, and anorthite, which are silicates of aluminium, and potassium,\r\nsodium, or calcium, corresponding to the formulae KAlSi_{3}O_{8},\r\nNaAlSi_{3}O_{8}, and CaAl_{2}Si_{2}O_{8} respectively, and also of\r\nspecies intermediate in composition between albite and orthoclase, or\r\nalbite and anorthite. While differing in crystalline symmetry, all\r\nare characterized by two directions of cleavage which are nearly at\r\nright angles to one another. The double refraction, which is slight in\r\namount, is biaxial in character and variable in sign. The values of the\r\nleast and greatest of the indices of refraction range between 1·52 and\r\n1·53, and 1·53 and 1·55 respectively, the double refraction at the same\r\ntime varying from 0·007 to 0·012. The specific gravity lies between\r\n2·48 and 2·66, and the hardness ranges between the degrees 6 and 7 on\r\nMohs’s scale.\r\n\r\nMoonstone (Plate XXIX, Fig. 4), which is mainly pure orthoclase, alone\r\nis at all common in jewellery. It forms such an admirable contrasting\r\nframe for large coloured stones that it deserves greater popularity;\r\nno doubt the cheapness of the stones militates against their proper\r\nappreciation. The milky, bluish opalescence from which they take their\r\nname is caused by the reflection of light at the thin twin-lamellæ\r\nof which the structure is composed. They are always cut more or less\r\nsteeply _en cabochon_. The finest stones were at one time cut from\r\nthe felspar that came from the St. Gothard district in Switzerland\r\nand was in consequence known as adularia from the neighbouring Adular\r\nMountains, somewhat incorrectly, since none occurs at the latter\r\nlocality. At the present day practically all the moonstones on the\r\nmarket come from Ceylon. They run in price from £3 to £20 per oz. (28\r\ngrams).\r\n\r\nSunstone is a felspar containing flakes of hematite or goethite which\r\nimpart a spangled bronze appearance to the stones. Good material occurs\r\nin parts of Norway. The remarkable sheen of labradorite or blue felspar\r\nhas its origin in the interference of light at lamellar surfaces in\r\nthe interior; the uniformity of the colour over comparatively large\r\nareas testifies to the regularity of the lamellar arrangement. The\r\nfinest specimens were brought from the Isle of St. Paul off the coast\r\nof Labrador, where they were first discovered in 1770; large masses\r\nalso occur on the coast itself. Amazon-stone is an opaque green felspar\r\nwhich occurs in the Ilmen Mountains, Orenburg, Russia, and at Pike’s\r\nPeak, Colorado, United States. It obtains its name from the Amazon\r\nRiver, where, however, none has ever been found; there may have been\r\nsome confusion with a jade or similar stone.\r\n\r\nOccasionally clear colourless felspar has been faceted, and then\r\nclosely resembles rock-crystal. A careful determination of the\r\nrefractive indices and the specific gravity serves to discriminate\r\nbetween them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PLATE XXIX_\r\n\r\n   1. CAT’S EYE\r\n   2.

The colour varies from a sky-blue or a greenish blue to a\r\nyellowish green or apple-green. Only the former tints, which are at\r\nthe same time the rarer, are in general demand, and they possess the\r\ngreat advantage of harmonizing with the tint of the gold setting.\r\nThe blue colours are, especially in the case of the Siberian stones,\r\nby no means permanent, and fade in course of time. Turquoise is\r\namorphous and seldom crystalline, and is therefore somewhat porous; it\r\nshould consequently never be immersed in liquids or be contaminated\r\nwith greasy and dirty matter lest the dreaded change of colour be\r\nbrought about. The stones are translucent in thin sections, and a\r\ngood observation is possible with the refractometer if the back of\r\nthe stone is flat and polished, since only the section immediately\r\nadjacent to the instrument is concerned; the refractive index is about\r\n1·61. The specific gravity varies from 2·75 to 2·89. Turquoise has a\r\nhardness of slightly under 6 on Mohs’s scale, and takes a good polish,\r\nwhich is fairly durable, since on account of the comparative opacity\r\nof the stones scratches on the surface are not very noticeable.\r\nIn composition it is a complex phosphate of aluminium and copper,\r\ncorresponding to the formula CuOH.[6Al(OH)_{2}].H{5}.(PO_{4})_{4},\r\nwith ferric oxide replacing some alumina. The blue colour is due to\r\nthe copper constituent, and the predominance of iron may cause the\r\ngreenish shades; but the water contained in the stones plays no mean\r\npart, since they turn a dirty green when it is driven off. The faded\r\ncolour can sometimes be restored by immersion of the stone in ammonia\r\nand subsequent application of grease, but the effect is not lasting.\r\nAttempts are sometimes made to improve inferior stones by impregnating\r\nthem with Berlin blue, but with only qualified success. Turquoises are\r\nsaid to be affected by the perspiration from the skin.\r\n\r\nThe name of the species comes from a French word meaning Turkish, and\r\narises from the fact that the gem-stone first reached Europe by way of\r\nTurkey. Another, but less obvious, suggestion is that it is derived\r\nfrom the Persian name for the species, _piruzeh_. Our turquoise and\r\nother phosphates of similar appearance were probably known to Pliny\r\nunder the three names _callais_, _callaina_, and _callaica_.\r\n\r\nThe finest turquoise still comes from the famous mines near Nishapur in\r\nthe Persian province of Khorassan, where it was known in very ancient\r\ntimes; it is found with limonite filling the cracks and cavities\r\nin a brecciated porphyritic trachyte. Pieces of the turquoise and\r\nlimonite from here are sometimes cut without removal of the latter,\r\nand sold as ‘turquoise-matrix,’ when the precious stones are too tiny\r\nto be worth separate working. It also occurs at Serbâl in the Sinai\r\nPeninsula. Among the more recent localities may be mentioned Los\r\nCerillos Mountains, New Mexico; Sierra Nevada, Nevada, where pale blue\r\nand green stones are found; San Bernardino County, California, where\r\nagain the stones are rather pale; and Arizona, where it occurs in pale\r\ngreenish-blue stones.\r\n\r\nSome of the stones that have been seen are not the true turquoise but\r\nodontolite, or bone turquoise, which consists of the teeth and bones\r\nof mastodon or other extinct animals, phosphate of iron being the\r\ncolouring material. These stones may easily be recognized by their\r\norganic structure, which is clearly visible if viewed with a strong\r\nlens or under the microscope. Moreover, odontolite invariably contains\r\nsome calcium carbonate, and effervescence takes place if it be touched\r\nwith hydrochloric acid. Turquoise dissolves in hydrochloric acid, but\r\nwithout effervescence, and since it contains copper, a fine blue colour\r\nis imparted to the solution by the addition of ammonia. Odontolite has\r\na higher specific gravity, 3·0 to 3·5, but lower hardness, 5 on Mohs’s\r\nscale.\r\n\r\nVariscite, the hydrated phosphate of aluminium, corresponding to the\r\nformula AlPO_{4} + 2H_{2}O, is found in masses resembling a greenish\r\nturquoise, but it is much softer, being only 4 on Mohs’s scale. The\r\nspecific gravity is 2·55. Round nodular masses of variscite are found\r\nin Utah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER XXXIII\r\n\r\n                                 JADE\r\n\r\n\r\nThough not usually accounted precious among European nations or in\r\nWestern civilization in general, jade was held in extraordinary\r\nesteem by primitive man, and was fashioned by him into ornaments and\r\nutensils, often of considerable beauty, and even at the present day\r\nit ranks among the Chinese and Japanese peoples above all precious\r\nstones; indeed, the Chinese word _Yu_ and the Japanese words _Giyuku_\r\nor _Tama_ signify both jade and precious stones in general. According\r\nto the Chinese, jade is the prototype of all gems, and unites in\r\nitself the five cardinal virtues—_Jin_, charity; _Gi_, modesty; _Yu_,\r\ncourage; _Ketsu_, justice; and _Chi_, wisdom. When powdered and mixed\r\nwith water, it is supposed to be a powerful remedy for all kinds of\r\ninternal disorders, to strengthen the frame and prevent fatigue, to\r\nprolong life, and, if taken in sufficient quantity just before death,\r\nto prevent decomposition.\r\n\r\nJade is a general term that includes properly two distinct mineral\r\nspecies, nephrite or greenstone, and jadeite, which are very similar\r\nin appearance, both being fibrous and tough in texture, and more or\r\nless greenish in colour; but it is also applied to other species such\r\nas saussurite, californite, bowenite, and plasma, which have somewhat\r\nsimilar characters. The word jade is a corruption of the Spanish\r\n_pietra di hijada_, kidney-stone, in allusion to its supposed efficacy\r\nin diseases of that organ.\r\n\r\nNephrite or greenstone (Plate XXIX, Fig. 16) is the commoner of\r\nthe two jades. It is closely allied to the mineral hornblende, a\r\nsilicate of magnesium, iron, and calcium corresponding to the formula\r\nCa(Mg,Fe)_{3}(SiO_{3})_{4}, the magnesia being replaceable by ferrous\r\noxide. Microscopic examination shows that the structure consists of\r\ninnumerable independent fibres foliated or matted together, the former\r\ncharacter giving rise to a slaty and the latter to a horny appearance\r\nin the stone as seen by the unaided eye. The colour varies from grey\r\nto leaf- and dark-green, the tint deepening as the relative amount of\r\niron in the composition increases, and brown tints result from the\r\noxidation of the iron along cracks in the stone. The hardness is 6½ on\r\nMohs’s scale; nephrite is therefore about as hard as ordinary glass and\r\nsofter than quartz. When polished, it always acquires a greasy lustre.\r\nThe specific gravity ranges from 2·9 to 3·1. The least and greatest of\r\nthe principal refractive indices are 1·606 and 1·632 respectively, the\r\ndouble refraction being biaxial and negative; the coloured fibres also\r\ndisplay dichroism. All these differential effects are, however, masked\r\nin the stone because of the irregularity of the aggregation. Nephrite\r\nis fusible before the blowpipe, but only with difficulty. Its name is\r\nderived from the Greek word νεφρός, kidney, the allusion being the same\r\nas for jade.\r\n\r\nMany of the prehistoric implements found in Mexico and in the Swiss\r\nLake Habitations are composed of nephrite, but it is uncertain where\r\nthe mineral was obtained. Much of the material used by the Chinese\r\nat the present time comes from spots near the southern boundary of\r\nEastern Turkestan, especially in the valleys of the rivers Karakash and\r\nYarkand in the Kwen Lun range of mountains; it is also found farther\r\nnorth at the river Kashgar. It occurs in various provinces of China,\r\nnamely, Shensi, Kwei Chau, Kwang Tung, Yunnan, and Manchuria. Gigantic\r\nwaterworn boulders have been found in the Government of Irkutsk, near\r\nLake Baikal, in eastern Siberia, the first discovery being made in the\r\nbed of the Onot stream by the explorer and prospector J. P. Alibert,\r\nin 1850. A large boulder of this kind, weighing over half a ton (1156\r\nlb., or 524·5 kg.), is exhibited in the Mineral Gallery of the British\r\nMuseum (Natural History). An enormous mass, weighing over 2 tons (4718\r\nlb., or 2140 kg.), was discovered at Jordansmühl, Silesia, by Dr.\r\nG. F. Kunz, and is now in the magnificent collection of jade formed\r\nby Mr. Heber R. Bishop. Beautiful greenstone occurs in New Zealand,\r\nparticularly in the Middle Island. The Maoris have long used it for\r\nvarious useful and ornamental purposes, the most common being indicated\r\nby their general name for the species, _punamu_, axe-stone; _kawakawa_\r\nis the ordinary green variety, a fine section of which is shown on the\r\nwall of the Mineral Gallery of the British Museum (Natural History),\r\nwhile _inanga_, a grey variety, and _kahurangi_, a pale-green and\r\ntranslucent variety, are rare and highly prized.\r\n\r\nJadeite (Plate XXIX, Fig. 18) is by far the rarer of the two jades,\r\nand is the choicest gem with the Chinese. In composition it is a\r\nsilicate of sodium and aluminium with the formula NaAl(SiO_{3})_{2},\r\ncorresponding to the lithium mineral spodumene (p. 265). It has the\r\nsame toughness and greasy lustre as nephrite, but is harder, being\r\nrepresented by the symbol 7 on Mohs’s scale, and thus only slightly,\r\nif at all, softer than quartz. The other characters are also higher;\r\nthe specific gravity is about 3·34, and the least and greatest of the\r\nprincipal refractive indices are 1·66 and 1·68, the double refraction\r\nbeing biaxial and negative. The colour varies from white to almost\r\nan emerald green, the latter being especially prized, and often the\r\ngreen colour runs in streaks through the white. Jadeite fuses readily\r\nbefore the blowpipe to blebby glass, more easily than is the case with\r\nnephrite.\r\n\r\nThe finest jadeite comes from the Mogaung district in Upper Burma,\r\nwhere it is found in boulders and also with albite in dykes in a\r\ndark-green serpentine. The export trade to China, which absorbs\r\npractically the whole of the output, is exceedingly valuable, and\r\nrealizes nearly as much as the produce of the ruby mines. Jadeite is\r\nalso found in the Shensi and Yunnan provinces of China, and in Tibet.\r\n\r\n                   •       •       •       •       •\r\n\r\nA few words may be said about the other jade-like minerals. Saussurite,\r\nwhich is named after H. B. de Saussure, has resulted from the\r\ndecomposition of a felspar, and is nearly akin to the mineral zoisite.\r\nIt has the customary toughness of structure, and is greenish grey to\r\nwhite in colour. Its specific gravity is about 3·2, and hardness 6½ to\r\n7 on Mohs’s scale. It occurs near Lake Geneva. Bowenite is a green\r\nserpentine (p. 289) which is found at Smithfield, Rhode Island, U.S.A.,\r\nand in New Zealand and Afghanistan. Californite and plasma are compact\r\nvarieties of idocrase (p. 275) and chalcedony (p. 247) respectively.\r\nVerdite is a stone of rich green colour which is found in the form of\r\nlarge boulders in the North Kaap River, South Africa; it is composed of\r\ngreen mica (fuchsite) and some clayey matter.\r\n\r\nJade has of recent years been imitated in glass, but the latter is\r\nrecognizable by its vitreous lustre and inferior hardness, and sooner\r\nor later by its frangibility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXXIV\r\n\r\n                     SPODUMENE, IOLITE, BENITOITE\r\n\r\n\r\n                               SPODUMENE\r\n\r\n                       (_Kunzite_, _Hiddenite_)\r\n\r\nTill a few years ago scarcely known outside the ranks of mineralogists,\r\nspodumene suddenly leaped into notice in 1903 upon the discovery of the\r\nlovely lilac-coloured stones (Plate XXIX, Fig. 10) at Pala, San Diego\r\nCounty, California; they shortly afterwards received the name kunzite\r\nafter the well-known expert in gems, Dr. G. F. Kunz. The stones were\r\nfound here in a pegmatite dyke, and were of all shades, ranging from\r\npale pink to deep lilac, and at times as much as 150 carats in weight.\r\nPaler kunzite occurs with beryl and tourmaline at Coahuila Mountain\r\nin Riverside County, California, and colourless stones have recently\r\ncome to light in Madagascar. Kunzite is remarkable for its wonderful\r\ndichroism; the beautiful violet tint that springs out in one direction\r\ncomes with greater surprise because of the uninteresting yellowish\r\ntints in other directions. Unlike spodumene in general, kunzite is\r\nphosphorescent under the influence of radium.\r\n\r\nThe emerald-green variety (Plate XXIX, Fig. 11), named hiddenite after\r\nMr. W. E. Hidden, who discovered in 1881 the only known occurrence, in\r\nAlexander County, North Carolina, would no doubt have become popular\r\nhad the supply of material not been so very limited; few stones were\r\nfound, and the variety has never come to light elsewhere. The colour is\r\nsupposed to be due to chromic acid. Hiddenite being also dichroic, the\r\ntint varies with the direction.\r\n\r\nSpodumene is ordinarily rather a pale yellowish in hue, and, as its\r\nname (which is derived from σποδίος, ash-coloured) suggests, is not\r\nvery attractive. Clear, lemon-yellow stones (Plate XXIX, Fig. 9) are\r\nfound in Brazil and Madagascar.\r\n\r\nThe species is interesting scientifically because it contains the\r\nrare element lithium; it is a silicate of aluminium and lithium,\r\ncorresponding to the formula LiAl(SiO_{3})_{2}. The double refraction\r\nis biaxial in character and positive in sign, the least and greatest\r\nof the refractive indices being 1·660 and 1·675; the specific gravity\r\nis 3·185, and hardness 6½ to 7 on Mohs’s scale. Spodumene has an easy\r\ncleavage, and the cut stones call therefore for careful handling, lest\r\nthey be flawed or fractured. Two faceted stones, a beautiful kunzite\r\nand a fine hiddenite, weighing 60 and 2½ carats respectively, are\r\nexhibited in the British Museum (Natural History).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                IOLITE\r\n\r\nKnown also by various other names—cordierite, dichroite, and\r\nwater-sapphire (_saphire d’eau_)—this species owes its interest\r\nto the remarkable dichroism characterizing it, the principal\r\ncolours—smoky-blue and yellowish white—being in such contrast as to\r\nbe obvious to the unaided eye. The stones that are usually worked have\r\nintrinsically a smoky-blue colour, and are found in waterworn masses\r\nin the river-gravels of Ceylon, whence is the origin of the name\r\nwater-sapphire. Iolite, from ἴον, violet, and λίθος, stone, refers to\r\nthe colour; cordierite is named after Cordier, a French geologist, who\r\nfirst studied the crystallography of the species; and dichroite, of\r\ncourse, alludes to the most prominent character of the species.\r\n\r\nIolite is a silicate of aluminium and of magnesium and iron\r\ncorresponding to the formula H_{2}(Mg,Fe)_{4}Al_{8}Si_{10}O_{37}.\r\nThe double refraction is small in amount, biaxial in character, and\r\nnegative in sign, the least and greatest of the refractive indices\r\nbeing 1·543 and 1·551; the specific gravity is 2·63, and hardness 7 on\r\nMohs’s scale. Iolite, if used, is worked and polished; it is seldom\r\nfaceted. A large worked piece, weighing 177 grams, which was formerly\r\nin the Hawkins Collection, is exhibited in the British Museum (Natural\r\nHistory).\r\n\r\n\r\n                               BENITOITE\r\n\r\nThe babe among gem-stones, benitoite first saw the light of day a few\r\nyears ago, early in 1907. It occurs with the rare mineral neptunite,\r\nwhich was previously known only from Greenland, in narrow veins of\r\nnatrolite in Diablo Range near the head-waters of the San Benito River,\r\nSan Benito County, California. Despite careful search the species has\r\nnot been found except within the original restricted area. To science\r\nit is interesting both because of its composition, a silico-titanate\r\nof barium, corresponding to the formula BaTiSi_{3}O_{9}, and because\r\nits crystals belong to a class of crystalline symmetry which has\r\nhitherto not been represented among minerals. The double refraction\r\nis uniaxial, and since the ordinary index of refraction is 1·757 and\r\nthe extraordinary 1·804, it is positive in sign and large in amount,\r\nnamely, 0·047. The stones are characterized by strong dichroism, the\r\ncolour corresponding to the ordinary ray being white, and to the\r\nextraordinary greenish blue to indigo depending upon the tint of the\r\nstone. To obtain the best effect the stone must therefore be cut with\r\nthe table-facet parallel to the crystallographic axis. The specific\r\ngravity is 3·65, and hardness 6½ on Mohs’s scale. When first discovered\r\nthe species was supposed to be sapphire, and many stones were cut and\r\nsold as such. It is, however, much softer than sapphire, and is readily\r\ndistinguished by its optical characters, since it possesses greater\r\ndouble refraction and of differing sign, so that, when tested with the\r\nrefractometer, the shadow-edge corresponding to the lower index of\r\nrefraction remains fixed in the case of benitoite, whereas the contrary\r\nhappens with sapphire. Benitoite also, unlike sapphire, fuses easily\r\nto a transparent glass. Its blue colour, which is supposed to be due\r\nto a small amount of free titanic acid present, appears to be stable.\r\nSeveral stones as large as 1½ to 2 carats in weight have been found.\r\nThe largest of all, perfectly flawless, weighs just over 7 carats, and\r\nis remarkable because it is about three times the next largest in point\r\nof weight; it is the property of Mr. G. Eacret, of San Francisco.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXXV\r\n\r\n                    EUCLASE, PHENAKITE, BERYLLONITE\r\n\r\n\r\n                                EUCLASE\r\n\r\nThis species comes near beryl in chemical composition, being a\r\nsilicate of aluminium and beryllium corresponding to the formula\r\nBe(AlOH)SiO_{4}, and closely resembles aquamarine in colour and\r\nappearance when cut. Owing to the rarity of the mineral good specimens\r\ncommand high prices for museum collections, and it is seldom worth\r\nwhile cutting it for jewellery. It derives its name from its easy\r\ncleavage, εὖ easily, and κλάσις fracture. The double refraction is\r\nbiaxial in character and positive in sign, the least and greatest of\r\nthe refractive indices being 1·651 and 1·670 respectively; the specific\r\ngravity is 3·07, and the hardness 7½ on Mohs’s scale. The colour is\r\nusually a sea-green, but sometimes blue. Euclase occurs with topaz at\r\nthe rich mineral district of Minas Novas, Minas Geraes, Brazil, and has\r\nalso been found in the Ural district, Russia.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               PHENAKITE\r\n\r\nAnother beryllium mineral, phenakite owes its name to the frequency\r\nwith which it has been mistaken for quartz, being derived from φέναξ,\r\ndeceiver. The clear, colourless crystals, somewhat complex in form,\r\nhave at times been cut, but they lack ‘fire,’ and despite their\r\nbrilliant lustre meet with little demand. The composition is a silicate\r\nof beryllium corresponding to the formula Be_{2}SiO_{4}. The double\r\nrefraction is uniaxial, and since the ordinary, 1·652, is less than\r\nthe extraordinary index, 1·667, it is positive in sign; the specific\r\ngravity is 2·99, and the hardness is almost equal to that of topaz,\r\nbeing about 7½ to 8 on Mohs’s scale.\r\n\r\nFine stones have long been known near Ekaterinburg in the Ural\r\nMountains, and have recently been discovered in Brazil.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              BERYLLONITE\r\n\r\nAs its name suggests, this mineral also contains beryllium, being\r\na soda phosphate corresponding to the formula NaBePO_{4}. Clear,\r\ncolourless stones, which occur at Stoneham, Maine, U.S.A., have been\r\ncut, but the lack of ‘fire,’ the easy cleavage, and comparative\r\nsoftness, the symbol being 5½ on Mohs’s scale, unfit it for use in\r\njewellery. The double refraction is biaxial in character and negative\r\nin sign, the least and the greatest of the refractive indices being\r\n1·553 and 1·565 respectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXXVI\r\n\r\n     ENSTATITE, DIOPSIDE, KYANITE, ANDALUSITE, IDOCRASE, EPIDOTE,\r\n             SPHENE, AXINITE, PREHNITE, APATITE, DIOPTASE\r\n\r\n\r\n                               ENSTATITE\r\n\r\n                          (‘_Green Garnet_’)\r\n\r\nThe small green stones which accompany the diamond in South Africa have\r\nbeen cut and put on the market as ‘green garnet.’ They are, however,\r\nin no way connected with garnet, but belong to a mineral species\r\ncalled enstatite, which is a silicate of magnesium corresponding to\r\nthe formula MgSiO_{3}; the green colour is due to a small amount of\r\nferrous oxide which replaces magnesia. The double refraction is biaxial\r\nin character and positive in sign, the least and greatest of the\r\nrefractive indices being 1·665 and 1·674 respectively; the specific\r\ngravity ranges from 3·10 to 3·13, and the hardness is only about 5½\r\non Mohs’s scale. The dichroism is perceptible, the twin-colours being\r\nyellowish and green, and, as usual, is more pronounced the deeper the\r\ncolour of the stone. There is also a good cleavage in two different\r\ndirections.\r\n\r\nWith increasing percentage amount of iron enstatite passes into\r\nhypersthene. The colour becomes a dark brownish green, and an increase\r\ntakes place in the physical constants, the least and greatest of the\r\nrefractive indices attaining to 1·692 and 1·705 respectively, and\r\nthe specific gravity ranging from 3·4 to 3·5. Hypersthene is never\r\nsufficiently transparent for faceting, but when spangled with small\r\nscales of brookite it is sometimes cut _en cabochon_.\r\n\r\nThe name enstatite is derived from ἐνστάτης, an opponent, referring to\r\nthe infusibility of the mineral before the blowpipe, and hypersthene\r\ncomes from ὑπερσθένος, very tough.\r\n\r\nAn altered enstatite, leek-green in colour and with nearly the\r\ncomposition of serpentine (p. 289), has been cut _en cabochon_. It has\r\nmuch lower specific gravity, only 2·6, and lower hardness, 3½ to 4 on\r\nMohs’s scale. It is named bastite from Baste in the Harz Mountains,\r\nwhere it was first discovered.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               DIOPSIDE\r\n\r\nThis species, which is also known as malacolite and alalite, provides\r\nstones of a leaf-green colour which have occasionally been cut. It\r\nis a silicate of calcium and magnesium corresponding to the formula\r\nMgCa(SiO_{3})_{2}, but usually contains in place of magnesia some\r\nferrous oxide, to which it owes its colour; with increase in the\r\npercentage amount of iron the colour deepens and the physical constants\r\nchange. The double refraction is large in amount, 0·028, biaxial\r\nin character, and positive in sign. The least and greatest of the\r\nrefractive indices corresponding to the stones suitable for jewellery\r\nrange about 1·671 and 1·699 respectively, but they may be as high as\r\n1·732 and 1·750 in the two cases. The specific gravity varies from 3·20\r\nto 3·38, and the hardness from 5 to 6 on Mohs’s scale. Dichroism is\r\nnoticeable in deep-coloured stones, but is not very marked.\r\n\r\nThe name diopside comes from δίς, double, and ὄψις, appearance, in\r\nallusion to the effect resulting from the double refraction; malacolite\r\nis derived from μαλακός, soft, because the mineral is softer than the\r\nfelspar associated with it; and alalite is named after the principal\r\nlocality, Ala Valley, Piedmont, Italy.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                KYANITE\r\n\r\nKyanite, also known as disthene, is interesting for two reasons. Its\r\nstructure is so grained in character that the hardness varies in the\r\nsame stone from 5 to 7 on Mohs’s scale; it can therefore be scratched\r\nby a knife in some directions, but not in others (p. 79). It has the\r\nsame chemical composition as andalusite, both being silicates of\r\naluminium corresponding to the formula Al_{2}SiO_{5}, but possesses\r\nvery different physical characters, a fact which shows how large\r\na share the molecular grouping has in determining the aspect of\r\ncrystallized substances. It is biaxial with small negative double\r\nrefraction, the least and greatest of the refractive indices being\r\n1·72 and 1·73 respectively; the specific gravity is 3·61. It occurs in\r\nsky-blue prismatic crystals, whitish at the edges, in schist near St.\r\nGothard, Switzerland. It is seldom cut.\r\n\r\nKyanite is derived from its colour, κύανος blue, and disthene, from its\r\nvariable hardness, δίς, twice, and σθένος, strong.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              ANDALUSITE\r\n\r\nAndalusite bears no resemblance whatever to kyanite, although, as has\r\nbeen stated above, the composition of the two species is essentially\r\nthe same. It is usually light bottle-green in colour, and more rarely\r\nbrown and reddish. Its extreme dichroism is its most remarkable\r\ncharacter, the twin colours being olive-green and red. The reddish\r\ngleams that are reflected from the interior are in sharp contrast with\r\nthe general colour of the stone, and impart to it a weird effect (Plate\r\nXXIX, Fig. 15). Cut stones are often confused with tourmalines, and\r\ncan, indeed, only be distinguished from the latter with certainty by\r\nnoting on the refractometer the smaller amount of double refraction\r\nand the difference in its character. The least and greatest of the\r\nrefractive indices are 1·62 and 1·643 respectively, and the double\r\nrefraction, 0·011, about half that of tourmaline, is biaxial and\r\nnegative; the specific gravity is 3·18, and hardness 7½ on Mohs’s scale.\r\n\r\nGood stones are found at Minas Novas, Minas Geraes, Brazil, and in\r\nthe gem-gravels of Ceylon. It was first known from the province of\r\nAndalusia, Spain, whence is the origin of its name.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               IDOCRASE\r\n\r\n                    (_Vesuvianite_, _Californite_)\r\n\r\nIdocrase, also known as vesuvianite, is occasionally found in the\r\nform of transparent, leaf-green, and yellowish-brown stones which,\r\nwhen cut, may be mistaken for diopside and epidote respectively, but\r\nare distinguishable from both by the extreme smallness of their\r\ndouble refraction. Californite is a compact variety which has all the\r\nappearances of a jade; its colour is green, or nearly colourless with\r\ngreen streaks.\r\n\r\nIn composition idocrase is a silicate of aluminium and calcium, the\r\nprecise formula of which is uncertain, but may be—\r\n\r\n             (Ca,Mn,Mg,Fe)_{2}[(Al,Fe)(OH,F)]Si_{2}O_{7}.\r\n\r\nThe double refraction, which is uniaxial in character and negative in\r\nsign, may be less than 0·001, and never exceeds 0·006, so that it is\r\nnot easily detected with the refractometer, even in sodium light. The\r\nrefractive indices vary enormously in value, from 1·702 to 1·726 for\r\nthe ordinary, and from 1·706 to 1·732 for the extraordinary ray. The\r\nspecific gravity varies from 3·35 to 3·45, and the hardness is about 6½\r\non Mohs’s scale.\r\n\r\nThe name idocrase, from εἴδος, form, and κρᾶσις, mixture, was assigned\r\nto the species by Haüy, but his reasons have little meaning at the\r\npresent day. The other names are taken from the localities where the\r\nspecies and the variety were first discovered.\r\n\r\nBright, green crystals come from Russia, and also from Ala Valley,\r\nPiedmont, and Mount Vesuvius, Italy. Californite is found in large\r\nmasses in Siskiyon and Fresno Counties, California.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                EPIDOTE\r\n\r\n                             (_Pistacite_)\r\n\r\nEpidote often possesses a peculiar shade of yellowish green, similar\r\nto that of the pistachio-nut—hence the origin of its alternative\r\nname—which is unique among minerals, though scarcely pleasing enough\r\nto recommend it to general taste. Its ready cleavage renders it liable\r\nto flaws; nevertheless, it is occasionally faceted. The name epidote,\r\nfrom ἐπίδοσις, increase, was given to it by Haüy, but not on very\r\nprecise crystallographical grounds.\r\n\r\nIn composition this species is a silicate of calcium and aluminium,\r\nwith some ferric oxide in place of alumina, corresponding to the\r\ncomplex formula, Ca_{2}(Al,Fe)_{2}[(Al,Fe)OH](SiO_{4})_{3}. It\r\noccurs in monoclinic, prismatic crystals richly endowed with natural\r\nfaces. The colour deepens with increase in the percentage amount of\r\niron, and the stones become almost opaque. The double refraction is\r\nlarge in amount, 0·031, biaxial in character, and negative in sign.\r\nThe dichroism is conspicuous in transparent stones, the twin-tints\r\ncorresponding to the principal optical directions being green, brown,\r\nand yellow. The values of the least and greatest of the refractive\r\nindices given by transparent stones are 1·735 and 1·766 respectively;\r\nthe specific gravity varies from 3·25 to 3·50, and the hardness from 6\r\nto 7 on Mohs’s scale.\r\n\r\nTransparent crystals have come from Knappenwand, Untersulzbachtal,\r\nSalzburg, Austria; Traversella, Piedmont, Italy; and Arendal, Nedenäs,\r\nNorway. Magnificent, but very dark, crystals were discovered about ten\r\nyears ago on Prince of Wales Island, Alaska.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                SPHENE\r\n\r\n                             (_Titanite_)\r\n\r\nThe clear, green, yellow, or brownish stones provided by this species\r\nwould be welcomed in jewellery because of their brilliant and\r\nalmost adamantine lustre, but, unfortunately, they are too soft to\r\nwithstand much wear, the hardness being only 5½ on Mohs’s scale. In\r\ncomposition sphene is a silico-titanate of calcium corresponding to\r\nthe formula CaTiSiO_{5}, and in this respect comes near the recently\r\ndiscovered gem-stone, benitoite. The refractive indices lie outside\r\nthe range of the refractometer, the values of the least and the\r\ngreatest of the refractive indices varying from 1·888 and 1·917 to\r\n1·914 and 2·053 respectively. It is to this high refraction that it\r\nowes its brilliant lustre. The double refraction, which is biaxial in\r\ncharacter and positive in sign, is so large that the apparent doubling\r\nof the opposite edges of a cut stone when viewed through one of the\r\nfaces is obvious to the unaided eye (cf. p. 41). Cut stones have\r\nadditional interest on account of the vivid dichroism displayed, the\r\ntwin-tints, colourless, yellow, and reddish yellow, corresponding to\r\nthe three principal optical directions, being in strong contrast. The\r\nspecific gravity ranges from 3·35 to 3·45. The negative test with the\r\nrefractometer (cf p. 26), the softness, and the large amount of double\r\nrefraction suffice to distinguish this species from gem-stones of\r\nsimilar appearance.\r\n\r\nThe name sphene, from σφήν, wedge, alludes to the shape of the natural\r\ncrystals. The alternative name is obviously due to the fact that the\r\nspecies contains titanium.\r\n\r\nGood stones have come from the St. Gothard district, Switzerland.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                AXINITE\r\n\r\nCalled axinite from the shape of its crystals—ἀξίνη, axe—this species\r\nsupplies small, clear, clove-brown, honey-yellow, and violet stones\r\nwhich can be cut for those who care for a stone out of the ordinary.\r\nThe composition is a boro-silicate of aluminium and calcium, with\r\nvarying amounts of iron and manganese, corresponding to the formula\r\n(Ca,Fe)_{3}Al_{2}(B.OH)Si_{4}O_{15}. Axinite is interesting on\r\naccount of its strong dichroism, the twin-tints corresponding to the\r\nprincipal optical directions being violet, brown, and green. The double\r\nrefraction is biaxial in character and negative in sign, the least and\r\ngreatest of the refractive indices being 1·674 and 1·684; the specific\r\ngravity is 3·28, and hardness about 6½ to 7, or rather under that of\r\nquartz.\r\n\r\nThe best examples have been found at St. Cristophe, Bourg d’Oisans, in\r\nthe Dauphiné, France. Violet axinite is a novelty that has come within\r\nrecent years from Rosebery, Montagu County, Tasmania.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               PREHNITE\r\n\r\nThis species, which is named after its discoverer, Colonel Prehn, is\r\nfound in nodular, yellow and oil-green stones, of which the latter\r\nhave very occasionally been cut. It is a little soft, the hardness\r\nbeing only 6 on Mohs’s scale. The double refraction is large in amount,\r\n0·033, biaxial in character, and positive in sign, the least and the\r\ngreatest of the refractive indices being 1·616 and 1·649 respectively;\r\nthe specific gravity varies from 2·81 to 2·95. In composition prehnite\r\nis a silicate of aluminium and calcium corresponding to the formula\r\nH_{2}Ca_{2}Al_{2}(SiO_{4})_{3}.\r\n\r\nThe best material has been found at St. Cristophe, Bourg d’Oisans,\r\nDauphiné, France.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                APATITE\r\n\r\nThis interesting mineral is found occasionally in attractive green,\r\nblue, or violet stones, but is unfortunately too soft for extensive use\r\nin jewellery, the hardness being only 5 on Mohs’s scale. In composition\r\nit is a fluo-chloro-phosphate of calcium, corresponding to the formula\r\nCa_{4}[Ca(F,Cl)](PO_{4})_{3}. When pure, it is devoid of colour,\r\nthe tints being due to the presence of small amounts of tinctorial\r\nagents. The double refraction is uniaxial in character and negative in\r\nsign, the ordinary index being 1·642 and the extraordinary 1·646; the\r\nspecific gravity varies from 3·17 to 3·23. The dichroism is usually\r\nfeeble, but sometimes is strong; for instance, in the stones from the\r\nBurma ruby mines (yellow, blue-green). A cut stone might be mistaken\r\nfor tourmaline, but is distinguished by its softness, or, when tested\r\non the refractometer, by its inferior double refraction. It received\r\nits name from ἀπατάειν, deceive, because it was wrongly assigned to at\r\nleast half a dozen different species in early days. Moroxite is a name\r\nsometimes given to blue-green apatite.\r\n\r\nBeautiful violet stones are found at Ehrenfriedersdorf, Saxony;\r\nSchlaggenwald, Bohemia; and Mount Apatite, Auburn, Androscoggin County,\r\nMaine, U.S.A.; and blue stones come from Ceylon.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               DIOPTASE\r\n\r\nThough of a pretty, emerald-green colour, dioptase has never been\r\nfound in large enough crystals for gem purposes, and it is, moreover,\r\nrather soft, the hardness being only 5 on Mohs’s scale, and has an\r\neasy cleavage. In composition it is a hydrous silicate of copper\r\ncorresponding to the formula CuH_{2}SiO_{4}. The double refraction,\r\nwhich is large in amount, is uniaxial in character, and positive in\r\nsign, the ordinary refractive index being 1·667 and the extraordinary\r\n1·723. Its colour and softness distinguish it from peridot or diopside,\r\nwhich have about the same refractivity. The name was assigned to the\r\nspecies by Haüy, from διὰ, through, and ὄπτομαι, see, because the\r\ncleavage directions were distinguishable by looking through the stone.\r\n\r\nDioptase has been found near Altyn-Tübe in the Kirghese Steppes, at\r\nRezbánya in Hungary, and Copiapo in Chili, and at the mine Mindouli,\r\nnear Comba, in the French Congo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER XXXVII\r\n\r\n                CASSITERITE, ANATASE, PYRITES, HEMATITE\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CASSITERITE\r\n\r\nThough usually opaque, this oxide of tin, corresponding to the formula\r\nSnO_{2}, has occasionally, but very rarely, been found in small,\r\ntransparent, yellow and reddish stones suitable for cutting. The lustre\r\nis adamantine. The refraction is uniaxial in character and positive\r\nin sign, the ordinary index being 1·997 and extraordinary 2·093. The\r\nspecific gravity is high, ranging from 6·8 to 7·1. The hardness is on\r\nthe whole less than that of quartz, being about 6 to 7 on Mohs’s scale.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                ANATASE\r\n\r\nThis mineral, which is one of the three crystallized forms of titanium\r\noxide, TiO_{2}, occurs often in small, brown, transparent stones which\r\noccasionally find their way into the market. The lustre is adamantine.\r\nThe refraction is uniaxial in character and negative in sign, the\r\nextraordinary index being 2·493 and ordinary 2·554. The specific\r\ngravity varies from 3·82 to 3·95, and the hardness is about 5½ to 6 on\r\nMohs’s scale.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           PYRITES, HEMATITE\r\n\r\nThese two metallic minerals were employed in ancient jewellery. The\r\nformer, sulphide of iron, FeS_{2}, is brass-yellow in colour, and has\r\na specific gravity 5·2, and hardness 6½ on Mohs’s scale. It is found,\r\nwhen fresh, in brilliant cubes. The latter, oxide of iron, Fe_{2}O_{3},\r\nhas a black metallic lustre, but, when powdered, is red in colour—a\r\nmode of distinguishing it from other minerals of similar appearance.\r\nIts specific gravity is 5·3, and hardness 6½ on Mohs’s scale. In modern\r\ntimes it has been cut in spherical form to imitate black pearls, but\r\ncan easily be recognized by its greater density and hardness. Hematite\r\nis used for signet stones, often with an intaglio engraving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER XXXVIII\r\n\r\n                          OBSIDIAN, MOLDAVITE\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo forms of natural glass have been employed for ornamental purposes.\r\nObsidian results from the solidification without crystallization of\r\nlava, and corresponds in composition to a granite. The structure\r\nis seldom clear and transparent, and usually contains inclusions\r\nor streaks. The colour is in the mass jet-black, but smoky in thin\r\nfragments, and occasionally greenish. Its property of breaking with a\r\nkeen cutting edge, in the same way as ordinary glass, rendered it of\r\nextreme utility to primitive man, who was ignorant of the artificial\r\nsubstance. The refraction is, of course, single, and the refractive\r\nindex approximates to 1·50. The specific gravity varies from 2·3 to\r\n2·5. The hardness is 5 on Mohs’s scale, the same as ordinary glass.\r\n\r\nObsidian is obtained wherever there has been volcanic activity. Vast\r\nmines of great antiquity exist in the State of Hidalgo, Mexico.\r\n\r\nMoldavite, which differs in no respect from ordinary green\r\nbottle-glass, is of interest on account of its problematical origin.\r\nIts occurrence in various parts of Bohemia and Moravia cannot be\r\nexplained as the result of volcanic agency. It may possibly be the\r\nproduct of old and forgotten glass factories which at one time existed\r\non the site. Even meteorites have been suggested as the source. The\r\nphysical characters are the same as those of ordinary glass: refraction\r\nsingle, index 1·51; specific gravity 2·50 and hardness 5½ on Mohs’s\r\nscale. Moldavite also passes under the names of bottle-stone, or\r\nwater-chrysolite. A natural glass of the same character has been found\r\nin water-worn fragments in Ceylon, and has been sold as peridot, which\r\nit resembles in colour, but is readily distinguished from it by its\r\nvery different physical properties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           PART II—SECTION C\r\n\r\n                           ORNAMENTAL STONES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXXIX\r\n\r\n      FLUOR, LAPIS LAZULI, SODALITE, VIOLANE, RHODONITE, AZURITE,\r\n         MALACHITE, THULITE, MARBLE, APOPHYLLITE, CHRYSOCOLLA,\r\n             STEATITE OR SOAPSTONE, MEERSCHAUM, SERPENTINE\r\n\r\n\r\nSpace will not permit of more than a few words concerning the more\r\nprominent of the numerous mineral species which are employed for\r\nornamental purposes in articles of virtu or in architecture, but which\r\nfor various reasons cannot take rank as gem-stones.\r\n\r\nFluor, a beautiful mineral which is found in its greatest perfection in\r\nEngland, has enjoyed well-deserved popularity when worked into vases\r\nor other articles. The finest material, deep purple in colour, known\r\nas ‘Blue John,’ came from Derbyshire, but the supply is now exhausted.\r\nThe crystallized examples, from Durham, Devonshire, and Cornwall, form\r\nsome of the most attractive of museum specimens. The crystals take the\r\nshape of cubes, often twinned, and have an easy octahedral cleavage.\r\nThe refraction is single, the index being 1·433. Fluor is noted for its\r\nproperty of appearing of differing colour by reflected and transmitted\r\nlight, and the phenomenon is in consequence known as fluorescence. The\r\nspecific gravity is 3·18, and the hardness 4 on Mohs’s scale. Owing to\r\nits low refraction and softness, fluor is not suitable for jewellery.\r\nClear colourless material is in demand for particular lenses of\r\nmicroscope objectives.\r\n\r\nThe lovely blue stone known as lapis lazuli has since the earliest\r\ntimes been applied to all kinds of decorative purposes, for mosaic\r\nand inlaid work and as the material for vases, boxes, and so on, and\r\nwas the original sapphire of the ancients. When ground to powder it\r\nfurnishes a fine blue paint, but it has now been entirely superseded\r\nfor this purpose by an artificial product. Although to the eye so\r\nhomogeneous and uniform in structure, lapis lazuli has been shown\r\nby microscopic examination to be composed of calcite coloured by\r\nthree blue minerals in varying proportions. All three belong to the\r\ncubic class of symmetry, and are mainly soda aluminium silicates\r\nin composition; their hardness varies from 5 to 6 on Mohs’s scale.\r\nLazurite, Na_{4}(NaS_{3}.Al)Al_{2}Si_{3}O_{12}, has specific gravity\r\nvarying from 2·38 to 2·45, and hardness about 5 to 5½; haüynite,\r\n(Na_{2},Ca)_{2}(NaSO_{4},Al)Al_{2}Si_{3}O_{12}, is about the same in\r\nspecific gravity, 2·4 to 2·5, but slightly harder, 5½ to 6; while\r\nsodalite, Na_{4}(AlCl)Al_{2}Si_{3}O_{12}, is the lightest in density,\r\n2·14 to 2·30, with hardness 5½ to 6, and has a refractive index 1·483.\r\n\r\nBy far the oldest mines are in the Badakshan district of Afghanistan,\r\na few miles above Firgamu in the valley of the Kokcha, a branch of\r\nthe Oxus, where ruby and spinel are found. It is also found at the\r\nsouthern end of Lake Baikal, Siberia, and in the Chilian Andes.\r\n\r\nSodalite occurs in beautiful blue masses at Dungannon, Hastings County,\r\nOntario, Canada, and at Litchfield, Maine, U.S.A. They make excellent\r\npolished stones.\r\n\r\nViolane, a massive, dark violet-blue diopside from San Marcel,\r\nPiedmont, Italy, also makes a handsome polished stone.\r\n\r\nRhodonite, silicate of manganese, MnSiO_{3}, possesses a fine red\r\ncolour, and makes an attractive stone when cut and polished. It has\r\nvery slight biaxial double refraction, the refractivity being about\r\n1·73; the specific gravity is 3·6, and hardness 6. It is found in large\r\nmasses near Ekaterinburg in the Ural Mountains, and is quarried as an\r\nornamental stone.\r\n\r\nBoth the copper carbonates, azurite or chessylite, and malachite, make\r\neffective polished stones. The latter is also worked into various\r\nornamental objects; it occurs in fibrous masses, the grained character\r\nof which look well in the polished section. Its colour is a bright\r\ngreen, to which it owes its name, from μαλακή, mallows. Its composition\r\nis represented by the formula CuCO_{3}.Cu(OH)_{2}, and it is the more\r\nstable form, since azurite is frequently found altered to it. It\r\nhas biaxial double refraction, and the indices are about 1·88; the\r\nspecific gravity is 4·01, and hardness about 3½ to 4 on Mohs’s scale.\r\nIt is found in large masses at the copper mines of Nizhni Tagilsk in\r\nthe Ural Mountains, where it is mined as an ornamental stone; it also\r\naccompanies the copper ores in many parts of the world, for instance\r\nCuba, Chili, and Australia. Azurite, so called on account of its\r\nbeautiful blue colour, is rarer, but, unlike malachite, is generally in\r\nthe form of crystals. Beautiful specimens have come from Chessy, near\r\nLyons, France, and Bisbee, Arizona, U.S.A. The composition corresponds\r\nto the formula 2CuCO_{3}, Cu(OH)_{2}. The specific gravity is 3·80, and\r\nhardness about 3½ to 4.\r\n\r\nChrysocolla occurs in blue and bluish-green earthy masses, with\r\nan enamel-like texture, which in some instances can be worked and\r\npolished. Being the result of the decomposition of copper ores, it\r\nvaries considerably in hardness, ranging from 2 to 4 on Mohs’s scale.\r\nIts composition approaches to the formula CuSiO_{3}.2H_{2}O, but it\r\ninvariably contains impurities. It is very light, the density being\r\nonly about 2·2.\r\n\r\nSteatite, or soapstone, is a massive foliated silicate of magnesium\r\ncorresponding to the formula H_{2}Mg_{3}Si_{4}O_{12}, which is one of\r\nthe softest of mineral substances, representing the degree 1 on Mohs’s\r\nscale, but in massive pieces is harder owing to the intermixture of\r\nother substances with it. It has a peculiar greasy feeling to the\r\ntouch, due to its softness. The specific gravity is about 2·75. The\r\nChinese carve images out of the yellowish and brownish pieces.\r\n\r\nMeerschaum, a silicate of magnesium corresponding to the formula\r\nH_{4}Mg_{2}Si_{3}O_{10}, is familiar to every smoker as a material for\r\npipe-bowls. It is very light, the specific gravity being only 2·0, and\r\nsoft, the hardness being about 2 to 2½ on Mohs’s scale. When found,\r\nit is pure white in colour, and answers to its name, a German word\r\nsignifying sea-foam. It comes from Asia Minor.\r\n\r\nSerpentine has been largely used for decorative purposes, as well\r\nas for cameos and intaglios, and formed most of the famous ‘verde\r\nantique.’ Being the result of the decomposition of other silicates\r\nit varies enormously in appearance and characters, but the most\r\nattractive stones are a rich oil-green in colour and resemble jade. The\r\ncomposition approximates to the formula H_{4}Mg_{3}Si_{2}O_{9}, but it\r\ninvariably contains other elements. The hardness varies from 2½ to 4\r\non Mohs’s scale, according to the minerals contained in the stone; the\r\nspecific gravity is about 2·60 and the refractivity 1·570.\r\n\r\nThe beautiful rose-red stone, thulite, makes a handsome decorative\r\nstone. It has nearly the same composition as epidote (p. 275), and like\r\nit has strong dichroism, the principal colours being yellow, light\r\nrose, and deep rose. The colour is due to manganese. Its refractive\r\nindex is about 1·70, specific gravity 3·12, and hardness 6 to 6½ on\r\nMohs’s scale; it possesses an easy cleavage. Fine specimens come from\r\nTelemark, Norway, and it is therefore called after the old name for\r\nNorway, Thule.\r\n\r\nMarble is a massive calcite, carbonate of lime, with the formula\r\nCaCO_{3}. When pure it is white, but it is usually streaked with other\r\nsubstances which impart a pleasing variety to its appearance. It is\r\nalways readily recognized by the immediate effervescence set up when\r\ntouched with a drop of acid. Calcite is highly doubly refractive (cf.\r\np. 40), the extraordinary index being 1·486, and ordinary 1·658, a\r\ndifference of 0·172; the specific gravity is 2·71, and hardness 3 on\r\nMohs’s scale. Lumachelle, or fire-marble, is a limestone containing\r\nshells from which a brilliant, fire-like chatoyancy is emitted\r\nwhen light is reflected at the proper angle. It sometimes resembles\r\nopal-matrix, but is easily distinguished by its lower hardness and by\r\nits effervescent action with acid. Choice specimens come from Bleiberg\r\nin Carinthia, and from Astrakhan.\r\n\r\nApophyllite has not many characters to commend it, being at the best\r\nfaintly pinkish in colour, and always imperfectly transparent. It is\r\na hydrous silicate of potassium and calcium with the complex formula\r\n(H,K)_{2}Ca(SiO_{3})_{2}.H_{2}O. Its refractivity is about 1·535,\r\nspecific gravity 2·5, and hardness 4½ on Mohs’s scale; it possesses\r\nan easy cleavage. It occurs in the form of tetragonal crystals at\r\nAndreasberg in the Harz Mountains, and in the Syhadree Mountains,\r\nBombay, India.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           PART II—SECTION D\r\n\r\n                           ORGANIC PRODUCTS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XL\r\n\r\n                          PEARL, CORAL, AMBER\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough none of the substances considered in this chapter come within\r\nthe strict definition of a stone, since they are directly the result of\r\nliving agency, yet pearl at least cannot be denied the title of a gem.\r\nBoth pearl and coral contain calcium carbonate in one or other of its\r\ncrystallized forms, and both are gathered from the sea; but otherwise\r\nthey have nothing in common. Amber is of vegetable origin, and is a\r\nvery different substance.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 PEARL\r\n\r\nFrom that unrecorded day when some scantily clothed savage seeking for\r\nsucculent food opened an oyster and found to his astonishment within\r\nits shell a delicate silvery pellet that shimmered in the light of a\r\ntropical sun, down to the present day, without intermission, pearl has\r\nheld a place all its own in the rank of jewels. Though it be lacking in\r\ndurability, its beauty cannot be disputed, and large examples, perfect\r\nin form and lustre, are sufficiently rare to tax the deepest purse.\r\n\r\nThe substance composing the pearl is identical with the iridescent\r\nlining—mother-o’-pearl or nacre, as it is termed—of the shell.\r\nTortured by the intrusion of some living thing, a boring parasite,\r\na worm, or a small fish, or of a grain of sand or other inorganic\r\nsubstance, and without means to free itself, the mollusc perforce\r\nneutralizes the irritant matter by converting it into an object of\r\nbeauty that eventually finds its way into some jewellery cabinet. Built\r\nup in a haphazard manner and not confined by the inexorable laws of\r\nintermolecular action, a pearl may assume any and every variety of\r\nshape from the regular to the fantastic. It may be truly spherical,\r\negg- or pear-shaped—pear-drops or pear-eyes, as they are termed—or it\r\nmay be quite irregular—the so-called baroque or barrok pearls. The\r\nfirst is the most prized, but a well-shaped drop-pearl is in great\r\ndemand for pendants or ear-rings. The colour is ordinarily white, or\r\nfaintly tinged yellowish or bluish, and somewhat rarely, salmon-pink,\r\nreddish, or blackish grey. Perfect black pearls are valuable, but not\r\nas costly as the finest of the white. Though not transparent, pearl is\r\nto a varying extent translucent, and its characteristic lustre—‘orient’\r\nin the language of jewellery—is due to the same kind of interaction\r\nof light reflected from different layers that has been remarked upon\r\nin the case of opal and certain other stones. The translucency varies\r\nin degree, and some jewellers speak of the ‘water’ of pearls just as\r\nin the case of diamonds. If a pearl be sliced across the middle and\r\nthe section be examined under the microscope, it will be seen that\r\nthe structure consists of concentric shells and resembles that of an\r\nonion. These shells are alternately composed of calcium carbonate in\r\nits crystallized form, aragonite, and of a horny organic matter known\r\nas conchiolin, and they evidently represent the result of intermittent\r\ngrowth. Because of their composite character, pearls have a specific\r\ngravity ranging from 2·65 to 2·69-2·84-2·89 in the case of pink\r\npearls—which is appreciably less than that of aragonite, 2·94: the\r\nhardness is about the same, namely, 3½ to 4 on Mohs’s scale. That the\r\narrangement of the mineral layers is approximately parallel is evinced\r\nby the distinctness of the shadow-edges shown on examination with the\r\nrefractometer. Pearls require very careful handling, both because they\r\nare comparatively soft and therefore apt to be scratched, and because\r\nthey are chemically affected by acids, and even by the perspiration\r\nfrom the skin. Acids attack only the calcium carbonate, not the\r\norganic matter; the well-known story therefore of Cleopatra dissolving\r\na valuable pearl in vinegar, which is moreover, too weak an acid to\r\neffect the solution quickly, must not be accepted too literally.\r\nPearls are not cut like stones, and therefore as soon as the precious\r\nbloom has once gone, nothing can be done to revive it. Attempts are\r\nsometimes made in the case of valuable pearls to remove the dull skin\r\nand lay bare another iridescent layer underneath, but the operation is\r\nexceedingly delicate. Even with the best of care pearls must in process\r\nof time perish owing to the decay of the organic constituent. Pearls\r\nthat have been discovered in ancient tombs crumbled to dust at a touch,\r\nand those formerly in ancient rings have vanished or only remain as\r\na brown powder, while the garnets or other stones set with them are\r\nlittle the worse for the centuries that have passed by.\r\n\r\nThe largest known pearl was at one time in the famous collection\r\nbelonging to the banker, Henry Philip Hope. Cylindrical in form, with\r\na slight swelling at one end, it measures 50 mm. (2 inches) in length,\r\nand 115 mm. (4½ inches) in circumference about the thicker, and 83\r\nmm. (3¼ inches) about the thinner end, and weighs 454 carats. About\r\nthree-quarters of it is white in colour with a fine ‘orient,’ and the\r\nremainder is bronze in tint. It is valued at upwards of £12,000. A\r\nlarge pearl, 300 carats in weight, is in the imperial crown of the\r\nEmperor of Austria, and another, pear-shaped, is in the possession of\r\nthe Shah of Persia. A beautiful white India pearl, a perfect sphere in\r\nshape, and 28 carats in weight, is in the Museum of Zosima in Moscow;\r\nit is known as ‘La Pellegrina.’ The ‘Great Southern Cross,’ which\r\nconsists of nine large pearls naturally joined together in the shape of\r\na cross, was discovered in an oyster fished up in 1886 off the beds of\r\nWestern Australia. The collection of jewels in the famous Green Vaults\r\nat Dresden contains a number of pearls of curious shapes.\r\n\r\nLarge pearls are sold separately, while the small pearls known as\r\n‘seed’ pearls come into the market bored and strung on silk in\r\n‘bunches.’ The unit of weight is the pearl grain, which is a quarter\r\nof a carat, and the rate of price depends on the square of the weight\r\nin grains. The rate per unit or base varies from 6d. to 50s. according\r\nto the shape and quality of the pearl. Spherical pearls command the\r\nbest prices, next the pearl-drops, and lastly the buttons; but whatever\r\nthe shape, it is imperative that the pearl have ‘orient,’ without which\r\nit is valueless. The cheaper grades of pearls are sold by the carat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PLATE XXX_\r\n\r\nNATIVES DRILLING PEARLS]\r\n\r\nFor use in necklaces and pendants pearls are bored with a steel drill,\r\nand threaded with silk, an easy operation on account of their softness.\r\nThey harmonize well with diamonds. Small pearls are often set as a\r\nframe to large coloured stones, to which they form an admirable foil.\r\nPearls set in rings or anywhere where the upper half alone would show\r\nare generally sawn in halves; ‘button’ pearls find an extensive use in\r\nmodern rings.\r\n\r\nAny mollusc, whether of the bi-valve or the uni-valve type, which\r\npossesses a nacreous shell, has the power of producing pearls,\r\nbut only two, the pearl-oyster, _Meleagrina margaritifera_, and\r\nthe pearl-mussel, _Unio margarifer_, repay the cost of systematic\r\nfishing. The outside of the shell is formed of the horny matter called\r\nconchiolin; while the inside is composed of two coats, of which\r\nthe outer consists of alternate layers of conchiolin and calcium\r\ncarbonate in its crystallized form, calcite, and the inner of the same\r\norganic matter, but with calcium carbonate in its other crystallized\r\nform, aragonite. The latter coat forms the nacreous lining known as\r\nmother-o’-pearl, which is identical in consistency with pearl, but\r\nsomewhat more transparent. The iridescence of mother-o’-pearl is due\r\nnot only to the fact that it is composed of a succession of thin\r\ntranslucent layers, but also to the fact that these layers overlap\r\nlike slates on a house, and form a series of fine parallel lines on\r\nthe surface; diffraction therefore as well as interference of light\r\ntakes place, and a similar diffraction phenomenon is displayed even\r\nby a cast of the inside of the shell. The animal has the property of\r\nsecreting calcium carbonate, which it absorbs from the sea-water, in\r\nboth its crystallized conditions as well as conchiolin. At the outer\r\nrim it secretes conchiolin, further in calcite, and at the very inside\r\naragonite. The shape and appearance of a pearl therefore depend on\r\nthe position in which the intruding substance is situated within the\r\nshell. The most perfect pearl has been in intermittent motion in the\r\ninterior of the mollusc, and has received successive coats according\r\nto the position in which it happened to be. A parasite that bores\r\ninto the shell is walled up at the point of entrance, and a wart- or\r\nblister-pearl results. The thinner the successive coats the finer\r\nthe lustre. Pearls have even been discovered embedded in the animal\r\nitself. The number of pearls found in a shell depends on the number of\r\ntimes the living host was compelled to seal up some irritant object,\r\nand may vary from one up to the eighty-seven which are said to have\r\nbeen found in an Indian oyster. That an oyster thus distinguished has\r\nnot led a happy existence is testified by the distorted shape of its\r\nshell, a clue that guides the pearl-fishers in their search. Moreover,\r\npearl-oysters never have thick nacreous shells, and on the other hand\r\nmolluscs with fine mother-o’-pearl seldom contain pearls.\r\n\r\nBeautiful white and silvery pearls are found in a small oyster that\r\nlives at a depth of 6 to 13 fathoms (11-24 m.) in the Gulf of Manaar,\r\noff the coast of Ceylon. About seven-eighths, however, of the pearls\r\nthat come into the market are obtained from a larger oyster which\r\nhas its home on the Arabian coast of the Persian Gulf. These famous\r\nfisheries have been known since very early times. The pearls found\r\nhere are more yellowish than those from Ceylon, but are nevertheless\r\nof excellent quality. The pearl fisheries off the north-west coast of\r\nWestern Australia and off Venezuela are also not unimportant, and fine\r\nblack pearls have been supplied by molluscs from the Gulf of Mexico.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PLATE XXXI_\r\n\r\nMETAL FIGURES OF BUDDHA INSERTED IN A PEARL-OYSTER]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PLATE XXXII_\r\n\r\nFIG. 1\r\n\r\nFIG. 2\r\n\r\nSECTIONS OF CULTURE PEARL\r\n\r\nFIG. 1.

MOTHER-O’-PEARL BACK ADDED.]\r\n\r\nThe Chinese have long made a practice of introducing into the shell of\r\na pearl-oyster little tin images of Buddha in order that they may be\r\ncoated with the nacreous secretion. The Japanese have during recent\r\nyears made quite an industry of stimulating the efforts of the mollusc\r\nby cementing small pieces of mother-o’-pearl to the interior surface\r\nof the shell (Plate XXXII, Fig. 1); these ‘culture’ pearls, as they\r\nare termed, are recognizable by examination of the back. About a year\r\nhas to elapse before a coating of a tenth of a millimetre is formed,\r\nand another two years must pass before the thickness is doubled. After\r\nremoval the piece of mother-o’-pearl, which is now coated with several\r\nnacreous layers, is cemented to a piece of ordinary mother-o’-pearl,\r\nand the lower portion is ground to the usual symmetrical shape (Plate\r\nXXXII, Fig. 2). Blister pearls are often similarly treated. In both\r\ncases, however, the ‘orient’ is deficient in quality.\r\n\r\nThe finest mother-o’-pearl is supplied by a mollusc found in the sea\r\nnear the islands lying between Borneo and the Philippines, and fine\r\nmaterial is found at Shark Bay and off Thursday Island.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 CORAL\r\n\r\nCoral ranks far below pearl and meets with but limited appreciation.\r\nIt is common enough in warm seas, but the only kind which finds its\r\nway into jewellery is the rose or red-coloured coral—the noble coral,\r\n_Corallium nobile_ or _rubrum_. It consists of the axial skeleton of\r\nthe coral polyp, and is built up of hollow tubes fitting one within\r\nthe other. The composition is mainly calcium carbonate with a little\r\nmagnesium carbonate and a small amount of organic matter. The former\r\nof the mineral substances is in the form of calcite, and the crystals\r\nare arranged in fibrous form radiating at right angles to the axis of\r\nthe coral. The specific gravity varies from 2·6 to 2·7, being slightly\r\nunder that of calcite, and the hardness is somewhat greater, being\r\nabout 3¾ on Mohs’s scale.\r\n\r\nThe best red coral is found in the Mediterranean Sea off Algiers and\r\nTunis in Africa, and Sicily and the Calabrian Coast of Italy. The\r\nindustry of shaping and fashioning the coral is carried on almost\r\nentirely in Italy. Coral is usually cut into beads, either round or\r\negg-shaped, and used for necklaces, rosaries, and bracelets. The best\r\nquality fetches from 20s. to 30s. per carat.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 AMBER\r\n\r\nThis fossil resin, yellow and brownish-yellow in tint, finds an\r\nextensive use as the material for mouthpieces of pipes, cigar and\r\ncigarette-holders, umbrella-handles, and so on, and is even locally\r\ncut for jewellery, although its extreme softness, its hardness being\r\nonly 2½ on Mohs’s scale, quite unfits it for such a purpose. It is\r\nonly slightly denser than water, the specific gravity being about\r\n1·10. Since the structure is amorphous the refraction is single, the\r\nindex being about 1·540. Amber, being a very bad conductor of heat, is\r\nperceptibly warm to the touch. Its property of becoming electrified by\r\nfriction attracted early attention, and from the Greek name for it,\r\nἤλεκτρον, is derived our word electricity.\r\n\r\nAmber is washed up by the sea off the coasts of Sicily and Prussia,\r\nand of Norfolk and Suffolk in England. The finest examples, which are\r\npicked up off the shore of Catania in Sicily, are distinguished by a\r\nfine bluish fluorescence, resembling that seen in lubricating oil; such\r\npieces command good prices.\r\n\r\nA recent resin, pale yellow in colour, known as kauri-gum, is found in\r\nNew Zealand, where it is highly valued.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                TABLES\r\n\r\n\r\n
