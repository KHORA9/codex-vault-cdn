In view of the scope of\r\nthe present work, it has been, of course, impossible to incorporate all\r\nthat has been done; but several new sections have been inserted, notably\r\nthose on the study of basic salts; the interpretation of cooling curves,\r\nand the determination of the composition of solid phases without analysis;\r\nthe equilibria between iron, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide, which are\r\nof importance in connection with the processes occurring in the blast\r\nfurnace; and the Phase Rule study of the ammonia-soda process. I have also\r\nincorporated a short section on the reciprocal salt-pair barium\r\ncarbonate--potassium sulphate, which had been written for the German\r\nedition of this book by the late Professor W. Meyerhoffer. The section on\r\nthe iron-carbon alloys, which in the first edition was somewhat\r\nunsatisfactory, has been rewritten.\r\n\r\nA. F.\r\n\r\n_September, 1906._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{viii}\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\nAlthough we are indebted to the late Professor Willard Gibbs for the first\r\nenunciation of the Phase Rule, it was not till 1887 that its practical\r\napplicability to the study of Chemical Equilibria was made apparent. In\r\nthat year Roozeboom disclosed the great generalization, which for upwards\r\nof ten years had remained hidden and unknown save to a very few, by\r\nstripping from it the garb of abstract Mathematics in which it had been\r\nclothed by its first discoverer. The Phase Rule was thus made generally\r\naccessible; and its adoption by Roozeboom as the basis of classification of\r\nthe different cases of chemical equilibrium then known established its\r\nvalue, not only as a means of co-ordinating the large number of isolated\r\ncases of equilibrium and of giving a deeper insight into the relationships\r\nexisting between the different systems, but also as a guide in the\r\ninvestigation of unknown systems.\r\n\r\nWhile the revelation of the principle embedded in the Phase Rule is\r\nprimarily due to Roozeboom, it should not be forgotten that, some years\r\npreviously, van't Hoff, in ignorance of the work of Willard Gibbs, had\r\nenunciated his \"law of the incompatibility of condensed systems,\" which in\r\nsome respects coincides with the Phase Rule; and it is only owing to the\r\nmore general applicability of the latter that the very {ix} important\r\ngeneralization of van't Hoff has been somewhat lost sight of.\r\n\r\nThe exposition of the Phase Rule and its applications given in the\r\nfollowing pages has been made entirely non-mathematical, the desire having\r\nbeen to explain as clearly as possible the principles underlying the Phase\r\nRule, and to illustrate their application to the classification and\r\ninvestigation of equilibria, by means of a number of cases actually\r\nstudied. While it has been sought to make the treatment sufficiently\r\nelementary to be understood by the student just commencing the study of\r\nchemical equilibria, an attempt has been made to advance his knowledge to\r\nsuch a stage as to enable him to study with profit the larger works on the\r\nsubject, and to follow with intelligence the course of investigation in\r\nthis department of Physical Chemistry. It is also hoped that the volume may\r\nbe of use, not only to the student of Physical Chemistry, or of the other\r\nbranches of that science, but also to the student of Metallurgy and of\r\nGeology, for whom an acquaintance with at least the principles of the Phase\r\nRule is becoming increasingly important.\r\n\r\nIn writing the following account of the Phase Rule, it is scarcely\r\nnecessary to say that I have been greatly indebted to the larger works on\r\nChemical Equilibria by Ostwald (\"Lehrbuch\"), Roozeboom (\"Die Heterogenen\r\nGleichgewichte\"), and Bancroft (\"The Phase Rule\"); and in the case of the\r\nfirst-named, to the inspiration also of personal teaching. My indebtedness\r\nto these and other authors I have indicated in the following pages.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I would express my thanks to Sir William Ramsay, whose\r\nguidance and counsel have been constantly {x} at my disposal; and to my\r\ncolleagues, Dr. T. Slater Price and Dr. A. McKenzie, for their friendly\r\ncriticism and advice. To Messrs. J. N. Friend, M.Sc., and W. E. S. Turner,\r\nB.Sc., I am also indebted for their assistance in reading the proof-sheets.\r\n\r\nA.

Thus, when water is placed in the Torricellian vacuum of\r\nthe barometer, the mercury is depressed, and the amount of depression\r\nincreases as the temperature is raised. But, although the pressure of the\r\nvapour increases as the temperature rises, its value at any given\r\ntemperature is constant, no matter whether the amount of water present or\r\nthe volume of the vapour is great or small; if the pressure on the vapour\r\nis altered while the temperature is maintained constant, either the water\r\nor the vapour will ultimately disappear; the former by evaporation, the\r\nlatter by condensation. At any given temperature within certain limits,\r\ntherefore, water and vapour can exist permanently in contact with one\r\nanother--or, as it is said, be in equilibrium with one another--only when\r\nthe pressure has a certain definite value. The same law of constancy of\r\nvapour pressure at a given {2} temperature, quite irrespective of the\r\nvolumes of liquid and vapour,[1] holds good also in the case of alcohol,\r\nether, benzene, and other pure liquids. It is, therefore, not unnatural to\r\nask the question, Does it hold good for all liquids? Is it valid, for\r\nexample, in the case of solutions?\r\n\r\nWe can find the answer to these questions by studying the behaviour of a\r\nsolution--say, a solution of common salt in water--when placed in the\r\nTorricellian vacuum. In this case, also, it is observed that the pressure\r\nof the vapour increases as the temperature is raised, but the pressure is\r\nno longer independent of the volume; as the volume increases, the pressure\r\nslowly diminishes. If, however, solid salt is present in contact with the\r\nsolution, then the pressure again becomes constant at constant temperature,\r\neven when the volume of the vapour is altered. As we see, therefore,\r\nsolutions do not behave in the same way as pure liquids.\r\n\r\nMoreover, on lowering the temperature of water, a point is reached at which\r\nice begins to separate out; and if heat be now added to the system or\r\nwithdrawn from it, no change will take place in the temperature or vapour\r\npressure of the latter until either the ice or the water has\r\ndisappeared.[2] Ice, water, and vapour, therefore, can be in equilibrium\r\nwith one another only at one definite temperature and one definite\r\npressure.\r\n\r\nIn the case of a solution of common salt, however, we may have ice in\r\ncontact with the solution at different temperatures and pressures. Further,\r\nit is possible to have a solution in equilibrium not only with anhydrous\r\nsalt (NaCl), but also with the hydrated salt (NaCl, 2H_{2}O), as well as\r\nwith ice, and the question, therefore, arises: Is it possible to state in a\r\ngeneral manner the conditions under which such different systems can exist\r\nin equilibrium; or to obtain some insight {3} into the relations which\r\nexist between pure liquids and solutions? As we shall learn, the Phase Rule\r\nenables us to give an answer to this question.\r\n\r\nThe preceding examples belong to the class of so-called \"physical\"\r\nequilibria, or equilibria depending on changes in the physical state. More\r\nthan a hundred years ago, however, it was shown by Wenzel and Berthollet\r\nthat \"chemical\" equilibria can also exist; that chemical reactions do not\r\nalways take place completely in one direction as indicated by the usual\r\nchemical equation, but that before the reacting substances are all used up\r\nthe reaction ceases, and there is a condition of equilibrium between the\r\nreacting substances and the products of reaction. As an example of this,\r\nthere may be taken the process of lime-burning, which depends on the fact\r\nthat when calcium carbonate is heated, carbon dioxide is given off and\r\nquicklime is produced. If the carbonate is heated in a closed vessel it\r\nwill be found, however, not to undergo entire decomposition. When the\r\npressure of the carbon dioxide reaches a certain value (which is found to\r\ndepend on the temperature), decomposition ceases, and calcium carbonate\r\nexists side by side with calcium oxide and carbon dioxide. Moreover, at any\r\ngiven temperature the pressure is constant and independent of the amount of\r\ncarbonate or oxide present, or of the volume of the gas; _nor does the\r\naddition of either of the products of dissociation, carbon dioxide or\r\ncalcium oxide, cause any change in the equilibrium_. Here, then, we see\r\nthat, although there are three different substances present, and although\r\nthe equilibrium is no longer due to physical, but to chemical change, it\r\nnevertheless obeys the same law as the vapour pressure of a pure volatile\r\nliquid, such as water.\r\n\r\nIt might be supposed, now, that this behaviour would be shown by other\r\ndissociating substances, _e.g._ ammonium chloride. When this substance is\r\nheated it dissociates into ammonia and hydrogen chloride, and at any given\r\ntemperature the pressure of these gases is constant,[3] and is independent\r\nof the amounts of solid and gas present. So far, therefore, ammonium\r\nchloride behaves like calcium carbonate. If, however, one of the {4}\r\nproducts of dissociation be added to the system, it is found that the\r\npressure is no longer constant at a given temperature, but varies with the\r\namount of gas, ammonia or hydrogen chloride, which is added. In the case of\r\ncertain dissociating substances, therefore, addition of one of the products\r\nof dissociation alters the equilibrium, while in other cases it does not.\r\nWith the help of the Phase Rule, however, a general interpretation of this\r\ndifference of behaviour can be given--an interpretation which can be\r\napplied not only to the two cases cited, but to all cases of dissociation.\r\n\r\nAgain, it is well known that sulphur exists in two different crystalline\r\nforms, octahedral and prismatic, each of which melts at a different\r\ntemperature. The problem here is, therefore, more complicated than in the\r\ncase of ice, for there is now a possibility not only of one solid form, but\r\nof two different forms of the same substance existing in contact with\r\nliquid. What are the conditions under which these two forms can exist in\r\ncontact with liquid, either singly or together, and under what conditions\r\ncan the two solid forms exist together without the presence of liquid\r\nsulphur? To these questions an answer can also be given with the help of\r\nthe Phase Rule.\r\n\r\nThese cases are, however, comparatively simple; but when we come, for\r\ninstance, to study the conditions under which solutions are formed, and\r\nespecially when we inquire into the solubility relations of salts capable\r\nof forming, perhaps, a series of crystalline hydrates; and when we seek to\r\ndetermine the conditions under which these different forms can exist in\r\ncontact with the solution, the problem becomes more complicated, and the\r\nnecessity of some general guide to the elucidation of the behaviour of\r\nthese different systems becomes more urgent.\r\n\r\nIt is, now, to the study of such physical and chemical equilibria as those\r\nabove-mentioned that the Phase Rule finds application; to the study, also,\r\nof the conditions regulating, for example, the formation of alloys from\r\nmixtures of the fused metals, or of the various salts of the Stassfurt\r\ndeposits; the behaviour of iron and carbon in the formation of steel and\r\nthe {5} separation of different minerals from a fused rock-mass.[4] With\r\nthe help of the Phase Rule we can group together into classes the large\r\nnumber of different isolated cases of systems in equilibrium; with its aid\r\nwe are able to state, in a general manner at least, the conditions under\r\nwhich a system can be in equilibrium, and by its means we can gain some\r\ninsight into the relations existing between different kinds of systems.\r\n\r\nHomogeneous and Heterogeneous Equilibrium.--Before passing to the\r\nconsideration of this generalization, it will be well to first make mention\r\nof certain restrictions which must be placed on its treatment, and also of\r\nthe limitations to which it is subject. If a system is uniform throughout\r\nits whole extent, and possesses in every part identical physical properties\r\nand chemical composition, it is called _homogeneous_. Such is, for example,\r\na solution of sodium chloride in water. An equilibrium occurring in such a\r\nhomogeneous system (such as the equilibrium occurring in the formation of\r\nan ester in alcoholic solution) is called _homogeneous equilibrium_. If,\r\nhowever, the system consists of parts which have different physical\r\nproperties, perhaps also different chemical properties, and which are\r\nmarked off and separated from one another by bounding surfaces, the system\r\nis said to be _heterogeneous_. Such a system is formed by ice, water, and\r\nvapour, in which the three portions, each in itself homogeneous, can be\r\nmechanically separated from one another. When equilibrium exists between\r\ndifferent, physically distinct parts, it is known as _heterogeneous\r\nequilibrium_. It is, now, with heterogeneous equilibria, with the\r\nconditions under which a heterogeneous system can exist, that we shall deal\r\nhere.\r\n\r\nFurther, we shall not take into account changes of equilibrium due to the\r\naction of electrical, magnetic, or capillary forces, or of gravity; but\r\nshall discuss only those which are due to changes of pressure, temperature,\r\nand volume (or concentration).\r\n\r\nReal and Apparent Equilibrium.--In discussing equilibria, also, a\r\ndistinction must be drawn between real and {6} apparent equilibria. In the\r\nformer case there is a state of rest which undergoes continuous change with\r\nchange of the conditions (_e.g._ change of temperature or of pressure), and\r\nfor which the chief criterion is that _the same condition of equilibrium is\r\nreached from whichever side it is approached_. Thus in the case of a\r\nsolution, if the temperature is maintained constant, the same concentration\r\nwill be obtained, no matter whether we start with an unsaturated solution\r\nto which we add more solid, or with a supersaturated solution from which we\r\nallow solid to crystallize out; or, in the case of water in contact with\r\nvapour, the same vapour pressure will be obtained, no matter whether we\r\nheat the water up to the given temperature or cool it down from a higher\r\ntemperature. In this case, water and vapour are in _real_ equilibrium. On\r\nthe other hand, water in contact with hydrogen and oxygen at the ordinary\r\ntemperature is a case only of _apparent_ equilibrium; on changing the\r\npressure and temperature continuously within certain limits there is no\r\ncontinuous change observed in the relative amounts of the two gases. On\r\nheating beyond these limits there is a sudden and not a continuous change,\r\nand the system no longer regains its former condition on being cooled to\r\nthe ordinary temperature. In all such cases the system may be regarded as\r\nundergoing change and as tending towards a state of true or real\r\nequilibrium, but with such slowness that no change is observed.\r\n\r\nAlthough the case of water in contact with hydrogen and oxygen is an\r\nextreme one, it must be borne in mind that the condition of true\r\nequilibrium may not be reached instantaneously or even with measurable\r\nvelocity, and in all cases it is necessary to be on one's guard against\r\nmistaking apparent (or false) for real (or true) equilibrium. The\r\nimportance of this will be fully illustrated in the sequel.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{7}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE PHASE RULE\r\n\r\nAlthough the fact that chemical reactions do not take place completely in\r\none direction, but proceed only to a certain point and there make a halt,\r\nwas known in the last quarter of the eighteenth century (Wenzel, 1777;\r\nBerthollet, 1799); and although the opening and subsequent decades of the\r\nfollowing century brought many further examples of such equilibria to our\r\nknowledge, it was not until the last quarter of the nineteenth century that\r\na theorem, general in its application and with foundations weakened by no\r\nhypothetical assumptions as to the nature or constitution of matter, was\r\nput forward by Willard Gibbs;[5] a generalization which serves at once as a\r\ngolden rule by which the condition of equilibrium of a system can be\r\ntested, and as a guide to the similarities and dissimilarities existing in\r\ndifferent systems.\r\n\r\nBefore that time, certainly, attempts had been made to bring the different\r\nknown cases of equilibria--chemical and physical--under general laws. From\r\nthe very first, both Wenzel[6] and Berthollet[7] recognized the influence\r\nexercised by the _mass_ of the substances on the equilibrium of the system.\r\nIt was reserved, however, for Guldberg and Waage, by their more general\r\nstatement and mathematical treatment of the Law of Mass Action,[8] to\r\ninaugurate the period of quantitative study of equilibria. The law which\r\nthese investigators enunciated {8} served satisfactorily to summarize the\r\nconditions of equilibrium in many cases both of homogeneous and, with the\r\nhelp of certain assumptions and additions, of heterogeneous equilibrium. By\r\nreason, however, of the fact that it was developed on the basis of the\r\nkinetic and molecular theories, and involved, therefore, certain\r\nhypothetical assumptions as to the nature and condition of the substances\r\ntaking part in the equilibrium, the law of mass action failed, as it\r\nnecessarily must, when applied to those systems in which neither the number\r\nof different molecular aggregates nor the degree of their molecular\r\ncomplexity was known.\r\n\r\nTen years after the law of mass action was propounded by Guldberg and\r\nWaage, Willard Gibbs,[9] Professor of Physics in Yale University, showed\r\nhow, in a perfectly general manner, free from all hypothetical assumptions\r\nas to the molecular condition of the participating substances, all cases of\r\nequilibrium could be surveyed and grouped into classes, and how\r\nsimilarities in the behaviour of apparently different kinds of systems, and\r\ndifferences in apparently similar systems, could be explained.\r\n\r\nAs the basis of his theory of equilibria, Gibbs adopted the laws of\r\nthermodynamics,[10] a method of treatment which had first been employed by\r\nHorstmann.[11] In deducing the law of equilibrium, Gibbs regarded a system\r\nas possessing only three independently variable factors[12]--temperature,\r\npressure, and the concentration of the components of the system--and he\r\nenunciated the general theorem now usually known as the _Phase Rule_, by\r\nwhich he defined the conditions of equilibrium as a relationship between\r\nthe number of what are called the phases and the components of the system.\r\n\r\nPhases.--Before proceeding farther we shall first consider what exactly is\r\nmeant by the terms _phase_ and _component_. We have already seen (p. 5)\r\nthat a heterogeneous system is made {9} up of different portions, each in\r\nitself homogeneous, but marked off in space and separated from the other\r\nportions by bounding surfaces. These homogeneous, physically distinct and\r\nmechanically separable portions are called _phases_. Thus ice, water, and\r\nvapour, are three phases of the same chemical substance--water. A phase,\r\nhowever, whilst it must be physically and chemically homogeneous, need not\r\nnecessarily be chemically simple. Thus, a gaseous mixture or a solution may\r\nform a phase; but a heterogeneous mixture of solid substances constitutes\r\nas many phases as there are substances present. Thus when calcium carbonate\r\ndissociates under the influence of heat, calcium oxide and carbon dioxide\r\nare formed. There are then _two_ solid phases present, viz. calcium\r\ncarbonate and oxide, and one gas phase, carbon dioxide.\r\n\r\nThe _number of phases_ which can exist side by side may vary greatly in\r\ndifferent systems. In all cases, however, there can be but one gas or\r\nvapour phase on the account of the fact that all gases are miscible with\r\none another in all proportions. In the case of liquid and solid phases the\r\nnumber is indefinite, since the above property does not apply to them. The\r\nnumber of phases which can be formed by any given substance or group of\r\nsubstances also differs greatly, and in general increases with the number\r\nof participating substances. Even in the case of a single substance,\r\nhowever, the number may be considerable; in the case of sulphur, for\r\nexample, at least eight different solid phases are known (_v._ Chap. III.).\r\n\r\nIt is of importance to bear in mind that equilibrium is _independent of the\r\namounts_ of the phases present.[13] Thus it is a familiar fact that the\r\npressure of a vapour in contact with a {10} liquid (_i.e._ the pressure of\r\nthe saturated vapour) is unaffected by the amounts, whether relative or\r\nabsolute, of the liquid and vapour; also the amount of a substance\r\ndissolved by a liquid is independent of the amount of solid in contact with\r\nthe solution. It is true that deviations from this general law occur when\r\nthe amount of liquid or the size of the solid particles is reduced beyond a\r\ncertain point,[14] owing to the influence of surface energy; but we have\r\nalready (p. 5) excluded such cases from consideration.\r\n\r\nComponents.--Although the conception of phases is one which is readily\r\nunderstood, somewhat greater difficulty is experienced when we come to\r\nconsider what is meant by the term _component_; for the components of a\r\nsystem are not synonymous with the chemical elements or compounds present,\r\n_i.e._ with the _constituents_ of the system, although both elements and\r\ncompounds may be components. By the latter term there are meant only those\r\nconstituents the concentration of which can undergo _independent_ variation\r\nin the different phases, and it is only with these that we are concerned\r\nhere.[15]\r\n\r\nTo understand the meaning of this term we shall consider briefly some cases\r\nwith which the reader will be familiar, and at the outset it must be\r\nemphasized that the Phase Rule is concerned merely with those constituents\r\nwhich take part in the state of real equilibrium (p. 5); for it is only to\r\nthe final state, not to the processes by which that state is reached, that\r\nthe Phase Rule applies.\r\n\r\nConsider now the case of the system water--vapour or ice--water--vapour.\r\nThe number of constituents taking part in the equilibrium here is only one,\r\nviz. the chemical substance, water. Hydrogen and oxygen, the constituents\r\nof water, are not to be regarded as components, because, in the first\r\nplace, they are {11} not present in the system in a state of real\r\nequilibrium (p. 6); in the second place, they are combined in definite\r\nproportions to form water, and their amounts, therefore, cannot be varied\r\nindependently. A variation in the amount of hydrogen necessitates a\r\ndefinite variation in the amount of oxygen.\r\n\r\nIn the case, already referred to, in which hydrogen and oxygen are present\r\nalong with water at the ordinary temperature, we are not dealing with a\r\ncondition of true equilibrium. If, however, the temperature is raised to a\r\ncertain point, a state of true equilibrium between hydrogen, oxygen, and\r\nwater-vapour will be possible. In this case hydrogen and oxygen will be\r\ncomponents, because now they do take part in the equilibrium; also, they\r\nneed no longer be present in definite proportions, but excess of one or the\r\nother may be added. Of course, if the restriction be arbitrarily made that\r\nthe free hydrogen and oxygen shall be present always and only in the\r\nproportions in which they are combined to form water, there will be, as\r\nbefore, only one component, water. From this, then, we see that a change in\r\nthe conditions of the experiment (in the present case a rise of\r\ntemperature) may necessitate a change in the number of the components.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, only in the case of systems of more than one component that\r\nany difficulty will be found; for only in this case will a choice of\r\ncomponents be possible. Take, for instance, the dissociation of calcium\r\ncarbonate into calcium oxide and carbon dioxide. At each temperature, as we\r\nhave seen, there is a definite state of equilibrium. When equilibrium has\r\nbeen established, there are three different substances present--calcium\r\ncarbonate, calcium oxide, and carbon dioxide; and these are the\r\nconstituents of the system between which equilibrium exists. Now, although\r\nthese constituents take part in the equilibrium, they are not all to be\r\nregarded as components, for they are not mutually independent. On the\r\ncontrary, the different phases are related to one another, and if two of\r\nthese are taken, the composition of the third is defined by the equation\r\n\r\n  CaCO_{3} = CaO + CO_{2}\r\n\r\n{12} Now, in deciding the number of components in any given system, not\r\nonly must the constituents chosen be capable of independent variation, but\r\na further restriction is imposed, and we obtain the following rule: _As the\r\ncomponents of a system there are to be chosen the_ smallest number _of\r\nindependently variable constituents by means of which the composition of\r\neach phase participating in the state of equilibrium can be expressed in\r\nthe form of a chemical equation._\r\n\r\nApplying this rule to the case under consideration, we see that of the\r\nthree constituents present when the system is in a state of equilibrium,\r\nonly two, as already stated, are independently variable. It will further be\r\nseen that in order to express the composition of each phase present, two of\r\nthese constituents are necessary. The system is, therefore, one of _two\r\ncomponents_, or a system of the second order.\r\n\r\nWhen, now, we proceed to the actual choice of components, it is evident\r\nthat any two of the constituents can be selected. Thus, if we choose as\r\ncomponents CaCO_{3} and CaO, the composition of each phase can be expressed\r\nby the following equations:--\r\n\r\n  CaCO_{3} = CaCO_{3} + 0CaO\r\n       CaO = CaO + 0CaCO_{3}\r\n    CO_{2} = CaCO_{3} - CaO\r\n\r\nAs we see, then, both zero and negative quantities of the components have\r\nbeen introduced; and similar expressions would be obtained if CaCO_{3} and\r\nCO_{2} were chosen as components. The matter can, however, be simplified\r\nand the use of negative quantities avoided if CaO and CO_{2} are chosen;\r\nand it is, therefore, customary to select these as the components.\r\n\r\nWhile it is possible in the case of systems of the second order to choose\r\nthe two components in such a way that the composition of each phase can be\r\nexpressed by positive quantities of these, such a choice is not always\r\npossible when dealing with systems of a higher order (containing three or\r\nfour components).\r\n\r\nFrom the example which has just been discussed, it might {13} appear as if\r\nthe choice of the components was rather arbitrary. On examining the point,\r\nhowever, it will be seen that the arbitrariness affects only the _nature_,\r\nnot the _number_, of the components; a choice could be made with respect to\r\nwhich, not to how many, constituents were to be regarded as components. As\r\nwe shall see presently, however, it is only the number, not the nature of\r\nthe components that is of importance.\r\n\r\nAfter the discussion of the conditions which the substances chosen as\r\ncomponents must satisfy, another method may be given by which the number of\r\ncomponents present in a system can be determined. Suppose a system\r\nconsisting of several phases in equilibrium, and the composition of each\r\nphase determined by analysis. If each phase present, regarded as a whole,\r\nhas the same composition, the system contains only one component, or is of\r\nthe first order. If two phases must be mixed in suitable quantities in\r\norder that the composition of a third phase may be obtained, the system is\r\none of two components or of the second order; and if three phases are\r\nnecessary to give the composition of a fourth coexisting phase, the system\r\nis one of three components, or of the third order.[16]\r\n\r\nAlthough the examples to be considered in the sequel will afford sufficient\r\nillustration of the application of the rules given above, one case may\r\nperhaps be discussed to show the application of the method just given for\r\ndetermining the number of components.\r\n\r\nConsider the system consisting of Glauber's salt in equilibrium with\r\nsolution and vapour. If these three phases are analyzed, the composition of\r\nthe solid will be expressed by Na_{2}SO_{4}, 10H_{2}O; that of the solution\r\nby Na_{2}SO_{4} + _x_H_{2}O, while the vapour phase will be H_{2}O. The\r\nsystem evidently cannot be a one-component system, for the phases have not\r\nall the same composition. By varying the amounts of two phases, however\r\n(_e.g._ Na_{2}SO_{4}, 10H_{2}O and H_{2}O), the composition of the third\r\nphase--the solution--can be obtained. The system is, therefore, one of _two\r\ncomponents_.\r\n\r\nBut sodium sulphate can also exist in the anhydrous form and as the hydrate\r\nNa_{2}SO_{4}, 7H_{2}O. In these cases there may {14} be chosen as\r\ncomponents Na_{2}SO_{4} and H_{2}O, and Na_{2}SO_{4}, 7H_{2}O and H_{2}O\r\nrespectively. In both cases, therefore, there are two components. But the\r\ntwo systems (Na_{2}SO_{4}, 10H_{2}O--H_{2}O, and Na_{2}SO_{4},\r\n7H_{2}O--H_{2}O) can be regarded as special cases of the system\r\nNa_{2}SO_{4}--H_{2}O, and these two components will apply to all systems\r\nmade up of sodium sulphate and water, no matter whether the solid phase is\r\nanhydrous salt or one of the hydrates. In all three cases, of course, the\r\n_number_ of components is the same; but by choosing Na_{2}SO_{4} and H_{2}O\r\nas components, the possible occurrence of negative quantities of components\r\nin expressing the composition of the phases is avoided; and, further, these\r\ncomponents apply over a much larger range of experimental conditions.\r\nAgain, therefore, we see that, although the number of the components of a\r\nsystem is definite, a certain amount of liberty is allowed in the choice of\r\nthe substances; and we also see that the choice will be influenced by the\r\nconditions of experiment.\r\n\r\nSumming up, now, we may say--\r\n\r\n(1) The components are to be chosen from among the constituents which are\r\npresent when the system is in a state of true equilibrium, and which take\r\npart in that equilibrium.\r\n\r\n(2) As components are to be chosen the _smallest number_ of such\r\nconstituents necessary to express the composition of each phase\r\nparticipating in the equilibrium, zero and negative quantities of the\r\ncomponents being permissible.\r\n\r\n(3) In any given system the _number_ of the components is definite, but may\r\nalter with alteration of the conditions of experiment. A certain freedom of\r\nchoice, however, is allowed in the (qualitative, not quantitative)\r\nselection of the components, the choice being influenced by considerations\r\nof simplicity, suitability, or generality of application.[17]\r\n\r\nDegree of Freedom. Variability of a System.--It is well known that in\r\ndealing with a certain mass of gas or vapour, _e.g._ water vapour, if only\r\none of the independently variable factors--temperature, pressure, and\r\nconcentration (or volume)--is fixed, the state of the gas or vapour is\r\nundefined; while occupying the same volume (the concentration, therefore,\r\nremaining {15} unchanged), the temperature and the pressure may be altered;\r\nat a given temperature, a gas can exist under different pressures and\r\noccupy different volumes, and under any given pressure the temperature and\r\nvolume may vary. If, however, two of the factors are arbitrarily fixed,\r\nthen the third factor can only have a certain definite value; at any given\r\nvalues of temperature and pressure a given mass of gas can occupy only a\r\ndefinite volume.\r\n\r\nSuppose, however, that the system consists of water in contact with vapour.\r\nThe condition of the system then becomes perfectly defined on arbitrarily\r\ngiving one of the variables a certain value. If the temperature is fixed,\r\nthe pressure under which water and water vapour can coexist is also\r\ndetermined; and conversely, if a definite pressure is chosen, the\r\ntemperature is also defined. Water and vapour can coexist under a given\r\npressure only at a definite temperature.\r\n\r\nFinally, let the water and vapour be cooled down until ice begins to\r\nseparate out. So soon as the third phase, ice, appears, the state of the\r\nsystem as regards temperature and pressure of the vapour is perfectly\r\ndefined, and none of the variables can be arbitrarily changed without\r\ncausing the disappearance of one of the phases, ice, water, or vapour.\r\n\r\nWe see, therefore, that in the case of some systems two, in other cases,\r\nonly one of the independent variables (temperature, pressure,\r\nconcentration) can be altered without destroying the nature of the system;\r\nwhile in other systems, again, these variables have all fixed and definite\r\nvalues. We shall therefore define the number of degrees of freedom[18] of a\r\nsystem as the _number of the variable factors, temperature, pressure, and\r\nconcentration of the components, which must be arbitrarily fixed in order\r\nthat the condition of the system may be perfectly defined_. From what has\r\nbeen said, therefore, we shall describe a gas or vapour as having two\r\ndegrees of freedom; the system water--vapour as having only one; and the\r\nsystem ice--water--vapour as having no degrees of freedom. We may also\r\nspeak of the {16} _variability_ or _variance_ of a system, and describe a\r\nsystem as being invariant, univariant, bivariant, multivariant,[19]\r\naccording as the number of degrees of freedom is nought, one, two, or more\r\nthan two.\r\n\r\nA knowledge of its variability is, therefore, of essential importance in\r\nstudying the condition and behaviour of a system, and it is the great merit\r\nof the Phase Rule that _the state of a system is defined entirely by the\r\nrelation existing between the number of the components and the phases\r\npresent_, no account being taken of the molecular complexity of the\r\nparticipating substances, nor any assumption made with regard to the\r\nconstitution of matter. It is, further, as we see, quite immaterial whether\r\nwe are dealing with \"physical\" or \"chemical\" equilibrium; in principle,\r\nindeed, no distinction need be drawn between the two classes, although it\r\nis nevertheless often convenient to make use of the terms, in spite of a\r\ncertain amount of indefiniteness which attaches to them--an indefiniteness,\r\nindeed, which attaches equally to the terms \"physical\" and \"chemical\"\r\nprocess.[20]\r\n\r\nThe Phase Rule.--The Phase Rule of Gibbs, which defines the condition of\r\nequilibrium by the relation between the number of coexisting phases and the\r\ncomponents, may be stated as follows: A system consisting of n components\r\ncan exist in _n_ + 2 phases only when the temperature, pressure, and\r\nconcentration have fixed and definite values; if there are _n_ components\r\nin _n_ + 1 phases, equilibrium can exist while one of the factors varies,\r\nand if there are only _n_ phases, two of the varying factors may be\r\narbitrarily fixed. This rule, the application of which, it is hoped, will\r\nbecome clear in the sequel, may be very concisely and conveniently\r\nsummarized in the form of the equation--\r\n\r\n  P + F = C + 2, or F = C + 2 - P\r\n\r\nwhere P denotes the number of the phases, F the degrees of freedom, and C\r\nthe number of components. From the second form of the equation it can be\r\nreadily seen that the greater the number of the phases, the fewer are the\r\ndegrees of freedom. With increase in the number of the phases, therefore,\r\nthe {17} condition of the system becomes more and more defined, or less and\r\nless variable.\r\n\r\nClassification of Systems according to the Phase Rule.--We have already\r\nlearned in the introductory chapter that systems which are apparently quite\r\ndifferent in character may behave in a very similar manner. Thus it was\r\nstated that the laws which govern the equilibrium between water and its\r\nvapour are quite analogous to those which are obeyed by the dissociation of\r\ncalcium carbonate into carbon dioxide and calcium oxide; in each case a\r\ncertain temperature is associated with a definite pressure, no matter what\r\nthe relative or absolute amounts of the respective substances are. And\r\nother examples were given of systems which were apparently similar in\r\ncharacter, but which nevertheless behaved in a different manner. The\r\nrelations between the various systems, however, become perfectly clear and\r\nintelligible in the light of the Phase Rule. In the case first mentioned,\r\nthat of water in equilibrium with its vapour, we have one\r\ncomponent--water--present in two phases, _i.e._ in two physically distinct\r\nforms, viz. liquid and vapour. According to the Phase Rule, therefore,\r\nsince C = 1, and P = 2, the degree of freedom F is equal to 1 + 2 - 2 = 1;\r\nthe system possesses one degree of freedom, as has already been stated. But\r\nin the case of the second system mentioned above there are two components,\r\nviz. calcium oxide and carbon dioxide (p. 12), and three phases, viz. two\r\nsolid phases, CaO and CaCO_{3}, and the gaseous phase, CO_{2}. The number\r\nof degrees of freedom of the system, therefore, is 2 + 2 - 3 = 1; this\r\nsystem, therefore, also possesses one degree of freedom. We can now\r\nunderstand why these two systems behave in a similar manner; both are\r\nunivariant, or possess only one degree of freedom. We shall therefore\r\nexpect a similar behaviour in the case of all univariant systems, no matter\r\nhow dissimilar the systems may outwardly appear. Similarly, all bivariant\r\nsystems will exhibit analogous behaviour; and generally, systems possessing\r\nthe same degree of freedom will show a like behaviour. In accordance with\r\nthe Phase Rule, therefore, we may classify the different systems which may\r\nbe found into invariant, univariant, bivariant, multivariant, {18}\r\naccording to the relation which obtains between the number of the\r\ncomponents and the number of coexisting phases; and we shall expect that in\r\neach case the members of any particular group will exhibit a uniform\r\nbehaviour. By this means we are enabled to obtain an insight into the\r\ngeneral behaviour of any system, so soon as we have determined the number\r\nof the components and the number of the coexisting phases.\r\n\r\nThe adoption of the Phase Rule for the purposes of classification has been\r\nof great importance in studying changes in the equilibrium existing between\r\ndifferent substances; for not only does it render possible the grouping\r\ntogether of a large number of isolated phenomena, but the guidance it\r\naffords has led to the discovery of new substances, has given the clue to\r\nthe conditions under which these substances can exist, and has led to the\r\nrecognition of otherwise unobserved resemblances existing between different\r\nsystems.\r\n\r\nDeduction of the Phase Rule.--In the preceding pages we have restricted\r\nourselves to the statement of the Phase Rule, without giving any indication\r\nof how it has been deduced. At the close of this chapter, therefore, the\r\nmathematical deduction of the generalization will be given, but in brief\r\noutline only, the reader being referred to works on Thermodynamics for a\r\nfuller treatment of the subject.[21]\r\n\r\nAll forms of energy can be resolved into two factors, the _capacity_ factor\r\nand the _intensity_ factor; but for the production of equilibrium, only the\r\nintensity factor is of importance. Thus, if two bodies having the same\r\ntemperature are brought in contact with each other, they will be in\r\nequilibrium as regards heat energy, no matter what may be the amounts of\r\nheat (capacity factor) contained in either, because the intensity\r\nfactor--the temperature--is the same. But if the temperature of the two\r\nbodies is different, _i.e._ if the intensity factor of heat energy is\r\ndifferent, the two bodies will no longer be in equilibrium; but heat will\r\npass from the hotter to the colder until both have the same temperature.\r\n\r\nAs with heat energy, so with chemical energy. If we have a substance\r\nexisting in two different states, or in two different {19} phases of a\r\nsystem, equilibrium can occur only when the intensity factor of chemical\r\nenergy is the same. This intensity factor may be called the _chemical\r\npotential_; and we can therefore say that a system will be in equilibrium\r\nwhen the chemical potential of each component is the same in all the phases\r\nin which the component occurs. Thus, for example, ice, water, and vapour\r\nhave, at the triple point, the same chemical potential.\r\n\r\nThe potential of a component in any phase depends not only on the\r\ncomposition of the phase, but also on the temperature and the pressure (or\r\nvolume). If, therefore, we have a system of C components existing in P\r\nphases, then, in order to fix the composition of unit mass of each phase,\r\nit is necessary to know the masses of (C - 1) components in each of the\r\nphases. As regards the composition, therefore, each phase possesses (C - 1)\r\nvariables. Since there are P phases, it follows that, as regards\r\ncomposition, the whole system possesses P(C - 1) variables. Besides these\r\nthere are, however, two other variables, viz. temperature and pressure, so\r\nthat altogether a system of C components in P phases possesses P(C - 1) + 2\r\nvariables.\r\n\r\nIn order to define the state of the system completely, it will be necessary\r\nto have as many equations as there are variables. If, therefore, there are\r\nfewer equations than there are variables, then, according to the deficiency\r\nin the number of the equations, one or more of the variables will have an\r\nundefined value; and values must be assigned to these variables before the\r\nsystem is entirely defined. The number of these undefined values gives us\r\nthe variability or the degree of freedom of the system.\r\n\r\nThe equations by which the system is to be defined are obtained from the\r\nrelationship between the potential of a component and the composition of\r\nthe phase, the temperature and the pressure. Further, as has already been\r\nstated, equilibrium occurs when the potential of each component is the same\r\nin the different phases in which it is present. If, therefore, we choose as\r\nstandard one of the phases in which all the components occur, then in any\r\nother phase in equilibrium with {20} it, the potential of each component\r\nmust be the same as in the standard phase. For each phase in equilibrium\r\nwith the standard phase, therefore, there will be a definite equation of\r\nstate for each component in the phase; so that, if there are P phases, we\r\nobtain for each component (P - 1) equations; and for C components,\r\ntherefore, we obtain C(P - 1) equations.\r\n\r\nBut we have seen above that there are P(C - 1) + 2 variables, and as we\r\nhave only C(P - 1) equations, there must be P(C - 1) + 2 - C(P - 1) = C + 2\r\n- P variables undefined. That is to say, the degree of freedom (F) of a\r\nsystem consisting of C components in P phases is--\r\n\r\n  F = C + 2 - P\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{21}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTYPICAL SYSTEMS OF ONE COMPONENT\r\n\r\nA. _Water._\r\n\r\nFor the sake of rendering the Phase Rule more readily intelligible, and at\r\nthe same time also for the purpose of obtaining examples by which we may\r\nillustrate the general behaviour of systems, we shall in this chapter\r\nexamine in detail the behaviour of several well-known systems consisting of\r\nonly one component.\r\n\r\nThe most familiar examples of equilibria in a one-component system are\r\nthose furnished by the three phases of water, viz. ice, water, water\r\nvapour. The system consists of one component, because all three phases have\r\nthe same chemical composition, represented by the formula H_{2}O. As the\r\ncriterion of equilibrium we shall choose a definite pressure, and shall\r\nstudy the variation of the pressure with the temperature; and for the\r\npurpose of representing the relationships which we obtain we shall employ a\r\ntemperature-pressure diagram, in which the temperatures are measured as\r\nabscissae and the pressures as ordinates. In such a diagram invariant\r\nsystems will be represented by points; univariant systems by lines, and\r\nbivariant systems by areas.\r\n\r\nEquilibrium between Liquid and Vapour. Vaporization Curve.--Consider in the\r\nfirst place the conditions for the coexistence of liquid and vapour.\r\nAccording to the Phase Rule (p. 16), a system consisting of one component\r\nin two phases has one degree of freedom, or is univariant. We should\r\ntherefore expect that it will be possible for liquid water to coexist with\r\nwater vapour at different values of temperature and {22} pressure, but that\r\nif we arbitrarily fix one of the variable factors, pressure, temperature,\r\nor volume (in the case of a given mass of substance), the state of the\r\nsystem will then be defined. If we fix, say, the temperature, then the\r\npressure will have a definite value; or if we adopt a certain pressure, the\r\nliquid and vapour can coexist only at a certain definite temperature. Each\r\ntemperature, therefore, will correspond to a definite pressure; and if in\r\nour diagram we join by a continuous line all the points indicating the\r\nvalues of the pressure corresponding to the different temperatures, we\r\nshall obtain a curve (Fig. 1) representing the variation of the pressure\r\nwith the temperature. This is the curve of vapour pressure, or the\r\n_vaporization curve_ of water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.]\r\n\r\nNow, the results of experiment are quite in agreement with the requirements\r\nof the Phase Rule, and at any given temperature the system water--vapour\r\ncan exist in equilibrium only under a definite pressure.\r\n\r\nThe vapour pressure of water at different temperatures has been subjected\r\nto careful measurement by Magnus,[22] Regnault,[23] Ramsay and Young,[24]\r\nJuhlin,[25] Thiesen and Scheel,[26] and others. In the following table the\r\nvalues of the vapour pressure from -10deg to +100deg are those calculated\r\nfrom the measurements of Regnault, corrected by the measurements of Wiebe\r\nand Thiesen and Scheel;[27] those from 120deg to 270deg were determined\r\n{23} by Ramsay and Young, while the values of the critical pressure and\r\ntemperature are those determined by Battelli.[28]\r\n\r\n  VAPOUR PRESSURE OF WATER.\r\n\r\n  -------------+-----------------+--------------+--------------------\r\n               |                 |              |\r\n  Temperature. | Pressure in cm. | Temperature. |   Pressure in cm.\r\n               |    mercury.     |              |      mercury.\r\n  -------------+-----------------+--------------+--------------------\r\n               |                 |              |\r\n     -10deg    |     0.213       |    120deg    |   148.4\r\n       0deg    |     0.458[29]   |    130deg    |   201.9\r\n     +20deg    |     1.752       |    150deg    |   356.8\r\n      40deg    |     5.516       |    200deg    |  1162.5\r\n      60deg    |    14.932       |    250deg    |  2973.4\r\n      80deg    |    35.54        |    270deg    |  4110.1\r\n     100deg    |    76.00        |    364.3deg  | 14790.4 (194.6 atm.)\r\n               |                 | (critical    | (critical pressure).\r\n               |                 | temperature) |\r\n  -------------+-----------------+--------------+--------------------\r\n\r\nThe pressure is, of course, independent of the relative or absolute volumes\r\nof the liquid and vapour; on increasing the volume at constant temperature,\r\na certain amount of the liquid will pass into vapour, and the pressure will\r\nregain its former value. If, however, the pressure be permanently\r\nmaintained at a value different from that corresponding to the temperature\r\nemployed, then either all the liquid will pass into vapour, or all the\r\nvapour will pass into liquid, and we shall have either vapour alone or\r\nliquid alone.\r\n\r\nUpper Limit of Vaporization Curve.--On continuing to add heat to water\r\ncontained in a closed vessel, the pressure of the vapour will gradually\r\nincrease. Since with increase of pressure the density of the vapour must\r\nincrease, and since with rise of temperature the density of the liquid must\r\ndecrease, a point will be reached at which the density of liquid and vapour\r\nbecome identical; the system ceases to be heterogeneous, and passes into\r\none homogeneous phase. The temperature at which this occurs is called the\r\n_critical temperature_. To this temperature there will, of course,\r\ncorrespond a certain definite pressure, called the _critical pressure_. The\r\ncurve representing the {24} equilibrium between liquid and vapour must,\r\ntherefore, end abruptly at the critical point. At temperatures above this\r\npoint no pressure, however great, can cause the formation of the liquid\r\nphase; at temperatures above the critical point the vapour becomes a gas.\r\nIn the case of water, the critical temperature is 364.3deg, and the\r\ncritical pressure 194.6 atm.; at the point representing these conditions\r\nthe vapour-pressure curve of water must cease.\r\n\r\nSublimation Curve of Ice.--Vapour is given off not only by liquid water,\r\nbut also by solid water, or ice. That this is so is familiar to every one\r\nthrough the fact that ice or snow, even at temperatures below the melting\r\npoint, gradually disappears in the form of vapour. Even at temperatures\r\nconsiderably lower than 0deg, the vapour pressure of ice, although small,\r\nis quite appreciable; and it is possible, therefore, to have ice and vapour\r\ncoexisting in equilibrium. When we inquire into the conditions under which\r\nsuch a system can exist, we see again that we are dealing with a univariant\r\nsystem--one component existing in two phases--and that, therefore, just as\r\nin the case of the system water and vapour, there will be for each\r\ntemperature a certain definite pressure of the vapour, and this pressure\r\nwill be independent of the relative or absolute amounts of the solid or\r\nvapour present, and will depend solely on the temperature. Further, just as\r\nin the case of the vapour pressure of water, the condition of equilibrium\r\nbetween ice and water vapour will be represented by a line or curve showing\r\nthe change of pressure with the temperature. Such a curve, representing the\r\nconditions of equilibrium between a solid and its vapour, is called a\r\n_sublimation curve_. At temperatures represented by any point on this\r\ncurve, the solid (ice) will sublime or pass into vapour without previously\r\nfusing. Since ice melts at 0deg (_vide infra_), the sublimation curve must\r\nend at that temperature.\r\n\r\nThe following are the values of the vapour pressure of ice between 0deg and\r\n-50deg.[30]\r\n\r\n{25}\r\n\r\n  VAPOUR PRESSURE OF ICE.\r\n\r\n  ---------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  Temperature. | Pressure in mm. | Temperature. | Pressure in mm.\r\n               |     mercury.    |              |     mercury.\r\n  -------------+-----------------+--------------+----------------\r\n    -50deg     |     0.050       |   -8deg      |     2.379\r\n    -40deg     |     0.121       |   -6deg      |     2.821\r\n    -30deg     |     0.312       |   -4deg      |     3.334\r\n    -20deg     |     0.806       |   -2deg      |     3.925\r\n    -15deg     |     1.279       |    0deg      |     4.602\r\n    -10deg     |     1.999       |              |\r\n  ----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nEquilibrium between Ice and Water. Curve of Fusion.--There is still another\r\nunivariant system of the one component water, the existence of which, at\r\ndefinite values of temperature and pressure, the Phase Rule allows us to\r\npredict. This is the system solid--liquid. Ice on being heated to a certain\r\ntemperature melts and passes into the liquid state; and since this system\r\nsolid--liquid is univariant, there will be for each temperature a certain\r\ndefinite pressure at which ice and water can coexist or be in equilibrium,\r\nindependently of the amounts of the two phases present. Since now the\r\ntemperature at which the solid phase is in equilibrium with the liquid\r\nphase is known as the melting point or point of fusion of the solid, the\r\ncurve representing the temperatures and pressures at which the solid and\r\nliquid are in equilibrium will represent the change of the melting point\r\nwith the pressure. Such a curve is called the _curve of fusion_, or the\r\nmelting-point curve.\r\n\r\nIt was not until the middle of the nineteenth century that this connection\r\nbetween the pressure and the melting point, or the change of the melting\r\npoint with the pressure, was observed. The first to recognize the existence\r\nof such a relationship was James Thomson,[31] who in 1849 showed that from\r\ntheoretical considerations such a relationship must exist, and predicted\r\nthat in the case of ice the melting point would be lowered by pressure.\r\nThis prediction was fully confirmed by his brother, W. Thomson[32] (Lord\r\nKelvin), who found that under a pressure {26} of 8.1 atm. the melting point\r\nof ice was -0.059deg; under a pressure of 16.8 atm. the melting point was\r\n-0.129deg.\r\n\r\nThe experiments which were first made in this connection were more of a\r\nqualitative nature, but in recent years careful measurements of the\r\ninfluence of pressure on the melting point of ice have been made more\r\nespecially by Tammann,[33] and the results obtained by him are given in the\r\nfollowing table and represented graphically in Fig. 2.\r\n\r\n  FUSION PRESSURE OF ICE.\r\n\r\n  ---------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n                  | Pressure in kilogms. per | Change of melting point for\r\n  Temperature.    |  sq. cm.[34]             | an increase of pressure of\r\n                  |                          | 1 kilogm. per sq. cm.\r\n  ---------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n     -0deg        |        1                 |\r\n     -2.5deg      |      336                 |       0.0074deg\r\n     -5deg        |      615                 |       0.0090deg\r\n     -7.5deg      |      890                 |       0.0091deg\r\n     -10.0deg     |     1155                 |       0.0094deg\r\n     -12.5deg     |     1410                 |       0.0100deg\r\n     -15.0deg     |     1625                 |       0.0116deg\r\n     -17.5deg     |     1835                 |       0.0119deg\r\n     -20.0deg     |     2042                 |       0.0121deg\r\n     -22.1deg     |     2200                 |       0.0133deg\r\n  ---------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nFrom the numbers in the table and from the figure we see that as the\r\npressure is increased the melting point of ice is lowered; but we also\r\nobserve that a very large change of pressure is required in order to\r\nproduce a very small change in the melting point. The curve, therefore, is\r\nvery steep. Increase of pressure by one atmosphere lowers the melting point\r\nby only 0.0076deg,[35] or an increase of pressure of 135 atm. is required\r\nto produce a lowering of the melting point of 1deg. We see further that the\r\nfusion curve bends slightly as the pressure is increased, which signifies\r\nthat the variation of {27} the melting point with the pressure changes; at\r\n-15deg, when the pressure is 1625 kilogm. per sq. cm., increase of pressure\r\nby 1 kilogm. per sq. cm. lowers the melting point by 0.012deg. This\r\ncurvature of the fusion curve we shall later (Chap. IV.) see to be an\r\nalmost universal phenomenon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.]\r\n\r\nEquilibrium between Ice, Water, and Vapour. The Triple Point.--On examining\r\nthe vapour-pressure curves of ice and water (Fig. 3), we see that at a\r\ntemperature of about 0deg and under a pressure of about 4.6 mm. mercury,\r\nthe two curves cut. At this point liquid water and solid ice are each in\r\nequilibrium with vapour at the same pressure. Since this is so, they must,\r\nof course, be in equilibrium {28} with one another, as experiment also\r\nshows. At this point, therefore, ice, water, and vapour can be in\r\nequilibrium, and as there are three phases present, the point is called a\r\n_triple point_.[36]\r\n\r\nThe triple point, however, does not lie exactly at 0deg C., for this\r\ntemperature is defined as the melting point of ice under atmospheric\r\npressure. At the triple point, however, the pressure is equal to the vapour\r\npressure of ice and water, and this pressure, as we see from the tables on\r\npp. 21 and 23, is very nearly 4.6 mm., or almost 1 atm. less than in the\r\nprevious case. Now, we have just seen that a change of pressure of 1 atm.\r\ncorresponds to a change of the melting point of 0.0076deg; the melting\r\npoint of ice, therefore, when under the pressure of its own vapour, will be\r\nvery nearly +0.0076deg, and the pressure of the vapour will be very\r\nslightly greater than 4.579 mm., which is the pressure at 0deg (p. 21). The\r\ndifference is, however, slight, and may be neglected here. At the\r\ntemperature, then, of +0.0076deg, and under a pressure of 4.6 mm. of\r\nmercury, ice, water, and vapour will be in equilibrium; the point in our\r\ndiagram representing this particular temperature and pressure is,\r\ntherefore, the triple point of the system ice--water--vapour.\r\n\r\nSince at the triple point we have three phases of one component, the system\r\nat this point is invariant--it possesses no degrees of freedom. If the\r\ntemperature is changed, the system will undergo alteration in such a way\r\nthat one of the phases will disappear, and a univariant system will result;\r\nif heat be added, ice will melt, and we shall have left water and vapour;\r\nif heat be abstracted, water will freeze, and we shall have left ice and\r\nvapour; if, when the temperature is altered, the pressure is kept constant,\r\nthen we shall ultimately obtain only one phase (see Chap. IV.).\r\n\r\nThe triple point is not only the point of intersection of the vaporization\r\nand sublimation curves, but it is also the end-point of the fusion curve.\r\nThe fusion curve, as we have seen, is the curve of equilibrium between ice\r\nand water; and since at the triple point ice and water are each in\r\nequilibrium with {29} vapour of the same pressure, they must, of course,\r\nalso be in equilibrium with one another.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.]\r\n\r\nBivariant Systems of Water.--If we examine Fig. 4, we see that the curves\r\nOA, OB, OC, which represent diagrammatically the conditions under which\r\nwater and vapour, ice and vapour, and water and ice are in equilibrium,\r\nform the boundaries of three \"fields,\" or areas, I., II., III. These areas,\r\nnow, represent the conditions for the existence of the single phases,\r\nsolid, liquid, and vapour respectively. At temperatures and pressures\r\nrepresented by any point in the field I., solid only can exist as a stable\r\nphase. Since we have here one component in only one phase, the system is\r\nbivariant, and at any given temperature, therefore, ice can exist under a\r\nseries of pressures; and under any given pressure, at a series of\r\ntemperatures, these pressures and temperatures being limited only by the\r\ncurves OB, OC. Similarly also with the areas II. and III.\r\n\r\nWe see, further, that the different areas are the regions of stability of\r\nthe phase common to the two curves by which the area is enclosed.[37] Thus,\r\nthe phase common to the two systems {30} represented by BO (ice and\r\nvapour), and OA (water and vapour) is the vapour phase; and the area BOA is\r\ntherefore the area of the vapour phase. Similarly, BOC is the area of the\r\nice phase, and COA the area of the water phase.\r\n\r\nSupercooled Water. Metastable State.--When heated under the ordinary\r\natmospheric pressure, ice melts when the temperature reaches 0deg, and it\r\nhas so far not been found possible to raise the temperature of ice above\r\nthis point without liquefaction taking place. On the other hand, it has\r\nlong been known that water can be cooled below zero without solidification\r\noccurring. This was first discovered in 1724 by Fahrenheit,[38] who found\r\nthat water could be exposed to a temperature of -9.4deg without\r\nsolidifying; so soon, however, as a small particle of ice was brought in\r\ncontact with the water, crystallization commenced. Superfused or\r\nsupercooled water--_i.e._ water cooled below 0deg--is unstable only in\r\nrespect of the solid phase; so long as the presence of the solid phase is\r\ncarefully avoided, the water can be kept for any length of time without\r\nsolidifying, and the system supercooled water and vapour behaves in every\r\nway like a stable system. A system, now, which in itself is stable, and\r\nwhich becomes instable only in contact with a particular phase, is said to\r\nbe _metastable_, and the region throughout which this condition exists is\r\ncalled the metastable region. Supercooled water, therefore, is in a\r\nmetastable condition. If the supercooling be carried below a certain\r\ntemperature, solidification takes place spontaneously without the addition\r\nof the solid phase; the system then ceases to be metastable, and becomes\r\n_instable_.\r\n\r\nNot only has water been cooled to temperatures considerably below the\r\nmelting point of ice, but the vapour pressure of the supercooled water has\r\nbeen measured. It is of interest and importance, now, to see what\r\nrelationship exists between the vapour pressure of ice and that of\r\nsupercooled water at the same temperature. This relationship is clearly\r\nshown by the numbers in the following table,[39] and is represented in Fig.\r\n3, {31} p. 27., and diagrammatically in Fig. 4, the vapour pressures of\r\nsupercooled water being represented by the curve OA', which is the unbroken\r\ncontinuation of AO.\r\n\r\n  VAPOUR PRESSURE OF ICE AND OF SUPERCOOLED WATER.\r\n\r\n  ---------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n                 |       Pressure in mm. mercury.\r\n                 ------------------------------------------------------\r\n  Temperature.   |               |               |\r\n                 |     Water.    |     Ice.      |    Difference.\r\n  ---------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n        0deg     |     4.618     |     4.602     |    0.016[40]\r\n       -2deg     |     3.995     |     3.925     |    0.070\r\n       -4deg     |     3.450     |     3.334     |    0.116\r\n       -8deg     |     2.558     |     2.379     |    0.179\r\n      -10deg     |     2.197     |     1.999     |    0.198\r\n      -15deg     |     1.492     |     1.279     |    0.213\r\n      -20deg     |     1.005     |     0.806     |    0.199\r\n  ---------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nAt all temperatures below 0deg (more correctly +0.0076deg), at which\r\ntemperature water and ice have the same vapour pressure, the vapour\r\npressure of supercooled water is _greater_ than that of ice at the same\r\ntemperature.\r\n\r\nFrom the relative positions of the curves OB and OA (Fig. 4) we see that at\r\nall temperatures above 0deg, the (metastable) sublimation curve of ice, if\r\nit could be obtained, would be higher than the vaporization curve of water.\r\nThis shows, therefore, that at 0deg a \"break\" must occur in the curve of\r\nstates, and that in the neighbourhood of this break the curve above that\r\npoint must ascend less rapidly than the curve below the break. Since,\r\nhowever, the differences in the vapour pressures of supercooled water and\r\nof ice are very small, the change in the direction of the vapour-pressure\r\ncurve on passing from ice to water was at first not observed, and Regnault\r\nregarded the sublimation curve as passing continuously into {32} the\r\nvaporization curve. The existence of a break was, however, shown by James\r\nThomson[41] and by Kirchhoff[42] to be demanded by thermo-dynamical\r\nconsiderations, and the prediction of theory was afterwards realized\r\nexperimentally by Ramsay and Young in their determinations of the vapour\r\npressure of water and ice, as well as in the case of other substances.[43]\r\n\r\nFrom what has just been said, we can readily understand why ice and water\r\ncannot exist in equilibrium below 0deg. For, suppose we have ice and water\r\nin the same closed space, but not in contact with one another, then since\r\nthe vapour pressure of the supercooled water is higher than that of ice,\r\nthe vapour of the former must be supersaturated in contact with the latter;\r\nvapour must, therefore, condense on the ice; and in this way there will be\r\na slow distillation from the water to the ice, until at last all the water\r\nwill have disappeared, and only ice and vapour remain.[44]\r\n\r\nOther Systems of the Substance Water.--We have thus far discussed only\r\nthose systems which are constituted by the three phases--ice, water, and\r\nwater vapour. It has, however, been recently found that at a low\r\ntemperature and under a high pressure ordinary ice can pass into two other\r\ncrystalline varieties, called by Tammann[45] ice II. and ice III., ordinary\r\nice being ice I. According to the Phase Rule, now, since each of these\r\nsolid forms constitutes a separate phase (p. 9), it will be possible to\r\nhave the following (and more) systems of water, in addition to those\r\nalready studied, viz. water, ice I., ice II.; water, ice I., ice III.;\r\nwater, ice II., ice III., forming invariant systems and existing in\r\nequilibrium only at a definite triple point; further, water, ice II.;\r\nwater, ice III.; ice I., ice II.; ice I., ice III.; ice II., ice III.,\r\nforming univariant systems, existing, therefore, at definite corresponding\r\nvalues of {33} temperature and pressure; and lastly, the bivariant systems,\r\nice II. and ice III. Several of these systems have been investigated by\r\nTammann. The triple point for water, ice I., ice III., lies at -22deg, and\r\na pressure of 2200 kilogms. per sq. cm. (2130 atm.), as indicated in Fig.\r\n2, p. 27.[46] In contrast with the behaviour of ordinary ice, the\r\ntemperature of equilibrium in the case of water--ice II., and water--ice\r\nIII., is _raised_ by increase of pressure.\r\n\r\nB. _Sulphur._\r\n\r\nPolymorphism.--Reference has just been made to the fact that ice can exist\r\nnot only in the ordinary form, but in at least two other crystalline\r\nvarieties. This phenomenon, the existence of a substance in two or more\r\ndifferent crystalline forms, is called _polymorphism_. Polymorphism was\r\nfirst observed by Mitscherlich[47] in the case of sodium phosphate, and\r\nlater in the case of sulphur. To these two cases others were soon added, at\r\nfirst of inorganic, and later of organic substances, so that polymorphism\r\nis now recognized as of very frequent occurrence indeed.[48] These various\r\nforms of a substance differ not only in crystalline shape, but also in\r\nmelting point, specific gravity, and other physical properties. In the\r\nliquid state, however, the differences do not exist.\r\n\r\nAccording to our definition of phases (p. 9), each of these polymorphic\r\nforms constitutes a separate phase of the particular substance. As is\r\nreadily apparent, the number of possible systems formed of one component\r\nmay be considerably increased when that component is capable of existing in\r\ndifferent crystalline forms. We have, therefore, to inquire what are the\r\nconditions under which different polymorphic forms can coexist, either\r\nalone or in presence of the liquid and vapour phase. For the purpose of\r\nillustrating the general behaviour of such systems, we shall study the\r\nsystems formed by the different crystalline forms of sulphur, tin, and\r\nbenzophenone.\r\n\r\n{34}\r\n\r\nSulphur exists in two well-known crystalline forms--rhombic, or octahedral,\r\nand monoclinic, or prismatic sulphur. Of these, the former melts at\r\n114.5deg; the latter at 120deg.[49] Further, at the ordinary temperature,\r\nrhombic sulphur can exist unchanged, whereas, on being heated to\r\ntemperatures somewhat below the melting point, it passes into the prismatic\r\nvariety. On the other hand, at temperatures above 96deg, prismatic sulphur\r\ncan remain unchanged, whereas at the ordinary temperature it passes slowly\r\ninto the rhombic form.\r\n\r\nIf, now, we examine the case of sulphur with the help of the Phase Rule, we\r\nsee that the following systems are theoretically possible:--\r\n\r\n  I. _Bivariant Systems: One component in one phase._\r\n    (_a_) Rhombic sulphur.\r\n    (_b_) Monoclinic sulphur.\r\n    (_c_) Sulphur vapour.\r\n    (_d_) Liquid sulphur.\r\n\r\n  II. _Univariant Systems: One component in two phases._\r\n    (_a_) Rhombic sulphur and vapour.\r\n    (_b_) Monoclinic sulphur and vapour.\r\n    (_c_) Rhombic sulphur and liquid.\r\n    (_d_) Monoclinic sulphur and liquid.\r\n    (_e_) Rhombic and monoclinic sulphur.\r\n    (_f_) Liquid and vapour.\r\n\r\n  III. _Invariant Systems: One component in three phases._\r\n    (_a_) Rhombic and monoclinic sulphur and vapour.\r\n    (_b_) Rhombic sulphur, liquid and vapour.\r\n    (_c_) Monoclinic sulphur, liquid and vapour.\r\n    (_d_) Rhombic and monoclinic sulphur and liquid.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.]\r\n\r\nTriple Point--Rhombic and Monoclinic Sulphur and Vapour. Transition\r\nPoint.--In the case of ice, water and vapour, we saw that at the triple\r\npoint the vapour pressures of ice and water are equal; below this point,\r\nice is stable; above this point, water is stable. We saw, further, that\r\nbelow 0deg the vapour pressure of the stable system is lower than that of\r\nthe metastable, and therefore that at the triple point there is a break in\r\nthe vapour pressure curve of such a kind that above {35} the triple point\r\nthe vapour-pressure curve ascends more slowly than below it. Now, although\r\nthe vapour pressure of solid sulphur has not been determined, we can\r\nnevertheless consider that it does possess a certain, even if very small,\r\nvapour pressure,[50] and that at the temperature at which the vapour\r\npressures of rhombic and monoclinic sulphur become equal, we can have these\r\ntwo solid forms existing in equilibrium with the vapour. Below that point\r\nonly one form, that with the lower vapour pressure, will be stable; above\r\nthat point only the other form will be stable. On passing through the\r\ntriple point, therefore, there will be a change of the one form into the\r\nother. This point is represented in our diagram (Fig. 5) by the point O,\r\nthe two curves AO and OB representing diagrammatically the vapour pressures\r\nof rhombic and monoclinic sulphur respectively. If the vapour phase is\r\nabsent and the system maintained under a constant pressure, _e.g._ {36}\r\natmospheric pressure, there will also be a definite temperature at which\r\nthe two solid forms are in equilibrium, and on passing through which\r\ncomplete and reversible transformation of one form into the other occurs.\r\nThis temperature, which refers to equilibrium in absence of the vapour\r\nphase, is known as the _transition temperature_ or _inversion temperature_.\r\n\r\nWere we dependent on measurements of pressure and temperature, the\r\ndetermination of the transition point might be a matter of great\r\ndifficulty. When we consider, however, that the other physical properties\r\nof the solid phases, _e.g._ the density, undergo an abrupt change on\r\npassing through the transition point, owing to the transformation of one\r\nform into the other, then any method by which this abrupt change in the\r\nphysical properties can be detected may be employed for determining the\r\ntransition point. A considerable number of such methods have been devised,\r\nand a description of the most important of these is given in the Appendix.\r\n\r\nIn the case of sulphur, the transition point of rhombic into monoclinic\r\nsulphur was found by Reicher[51] to lie at 95.5deg. Below this temperature\r\nthe octahedral, above it the monoclinic, is the stable form.\r\n\r\nCondensed Systems.--We have already seen that in the change of the melting\r\npoint of water with the pressure, a very great increase of the latter was\r\nnecessary in order to produce a comparatively small change in the\r\ntemperature of equilibrium. This is a characteristic of all systems from\r\nwhich the vapour phase is absent, and which are composed only of solid and\r\nliquid phases. Such systems are called _condensed systems_,[52] and in\r\ndetermining the temperature of equilibrium of such systems, practically the\r\nsame point will be obtained whether the measurements are carried out under\r\natmospheric pressure or under the pressure of the vapour of the solid or\r\nliquid phases. The transition point, therefore, as determined in open\r\nvessels at atmospheric pressure, will differ only by a very slight amount\r\nfrom the triple point, or point at which the two solid or liquid phases are\r\nin equilibrium under the pressure of their vapour. {37} The determination\r\nof the transition point is thereby greatly simplified.\r\n\r\nSuspended Transformation.--In many respects the transition point of two\r\nsolid phases is analogous to the melting point of a solid, or point at\r\nwhich the solid passes into a liquid. In both cases the change of phase is\r\nassociated with a definite temperature and pressure in such a way that\r\nbelow the point the one phase, above the point the other phase, is stable.\r\nThe transition point, however, differs in so far from a point of fusion,\r\nthat while it is possible to supercool a liquid, no definite case is known\r\nwhere the solid has been heated above the triple point without passing into\r\nthe liquid state. Transformation, therefore, is suspended only on one side\r\nof the melting point. In the case of two solid phases, however, the\r\ntransition point can be overstepped in both directions, so that each phase\r\ncan be obtained in the metastable condition. In the case of supercooled\r\nwater, further, we saw that the introduction of the stable, solid phase\r\ncaused the speedy transformation of the metastable to the stable condition\r\nof equilibrium; but in the case of two solid phases the change from the\r\nmetastable to the stable modification may occur with great slowness, even\r\nin presence of the stable form. This tardiness with which the stable\r\ncondition of equilibrium is reached greatly increases in many cases the\r\ndifficulty of accurately determining the transition point. The phenomena of\r\nsuspended transformation will, however, receive a fuller discussion later\r\n(p. 68).\r\n\r\nTransition Curve--Rhombic and Monoclinic Sulphur.--Just as we found the\r\nmelting point of ice to vary with the pressure, so also do we find that\r\nchange of pressure causes an alteration in the transition point. In the\r\ncase of the transition point of rhombic into monoclinic sulphur, increase\r\nof pressure by 1 atm. raises the transition point by 0.04deg-0.05deg.[53]\r\nThe transition curve, or curve representing the change of the transition\r\npoint with pressure, will therefore slope to the right away from the\r\npressure axis. This is curve OC (Fig. 5).\r\n\r\n{38}\r\n\r\nTriple Point--Monoclinic Sulphur, Liquid, and Vapour. Melting Point of\r\nMonoclinic Sulphur.--Above 95.5deg, monoclinic sulphur is, as we have seen,\r\nthe stable form. On being heated to 120deg, under atmospheric pressure, it\r\nmelts. This temperature is, therefore, the point of equilibrium between\r\nmonoclinic sulphur and liquid sulphur under atmospheric pressure. Since we\r\nare dealing with a condensed system, this temperature may be regarded as\r\nvery nearly that at which the solid and liquid are in equilibrium with\r\ntheir vapour, _i.e._ the triple point, solid (monoclinic)--liquid--vapour.\r\nThis point is represented in the diagram by B.\r\n\r\nTriple Point--Rhombic and Monoclinic Sulphur and Liquid.--In contrast with\r\nthat of ice, the fusion point of monoclinic sulphur is _raised_ by increase\r\nof pressure, and the fusion curve, therefore, slopes to the right. The\r\ntransition curve of rhombic and monoclinic sulphur, as we have seen, also\r\nslopes to the right, and more so than the fusion curve of monoclinic\r\nsulphur. There will, therefore, be a certain pressure and temperature at\r\nwhich the two curves will cut. This point lies at 151deg, and a pressure of\r\n1320 kilogm. per sq. cm., or about 1288 atm.[54] It, therefore, forms\r\nanother triple point, the existence of which had been predicted by\r\nRoozeboom,[55] at which rhombic and monoclinic sulphur are in equilibrium\r\nwith liquid sulphur. It is represented in our diagram by the point C.\r\n_Beyond this point monoclinic sulphur ceases to exist in a stable\r\ncondition._ At temperatures and pressures above this triple point, rhombic\r\nsulphur will be the stable modification, and this fact is of mineralogical\r\ninterest, because it explains the occurrence in nature of well-formed\r\nrhombic crystals. Under ordinary conditions, prismatic sulphur separates\r\nout on cooling fused sulphur, but at temperatures above 151deg and under\r\npressures greater than 1288 atm., the rhombic form would be produced.[56]\r\n\r\nTriple Point--Rhombic Sulphur, Liquid, and Vapour. Metastable Triple\r\nPoint.--On account of the slowness with {39} which transformation of one\r\nform into the other takes place on passing the transition point, it has\r\nbeen found possible to heat rhombic sulphur up to its melting point\r\n(114.5deg). At this temperature, not only is rhombic sulphur in a\r\nmetastable condition, but the liquid is also metastable, its vapour\r\npressure being greater than that of solid monoclinic sulphur. This point is\r\nrepresented in our diagram by the point b.\r\n\r\nFrom the relative positions of the metastable melting point of rhombic\r\nsulphur and the stable melting point of monoclinic sulphur at 120deg, we\r\nsee that, of the two forms, the metastable form has the lower melting\r\npoint. This, of course, is valid only for the relative stability in the\r\nneighbourhood of the melting point; for we have already learned that at\r\nlower temperatures rhombic sulphur is the stable, monoclinic sulphur the\r\nmetastable (or unstable) form.\r\n\r\nFusion Curve of Rhombic Sulphur.--Like any other melting point, that of\r\nrhombic sulphur will be displaced by increase of pressure; increase of\r\npressure raises the melting point, and we can therefore obtain a metastable\r\nfusion curve representing the conditions under which rhombic sulphur is in\r\nequilibrium with liquid sulphur. This metastable fusion curve must pass\r\nthrough the triple point for rhombic sulphur--monoclinic sulphur--liquid\r\nsulphur, and on passing this point it becomes a stable fusion curve. The\r\ncontinuation of this curve, therefore, above 151deg forms the stable fusion\r\ncurve of rhombic sulphur (curve CD).\r\n\r\nThese curves have been investigated at high pressures by Tammann, and the\r\nresults are represented according to scale in Fig. 6,[57] _a_ being the\r\ncurve for monoclinic sulphur and liquid; _b_, that for rhombic sulphur and\r\nliquid; and _c_, that for rhombic and monoclinic sulphur.\r\n\r\nBivariant Systems.--Just as in the case of the diagram of states of water,\r\nthe areas in Fig. 5 represent the conditions for the stable existence of\r\nthe single phases: rhombic sulphur in the area to the left of AOCD;\r\nmonoclinic sulphur in the area OBC; liquid sulphur in the area EBCD;\r\nsulphur vapour below the curves AOBE. As can be seen from the diagram, {40}\r\nthe existence of monoclinic sulphur is limited on all sides, its area being\r\nbounded by the curves OB, OC, BC. At any point outside this area,\r\nmonoclinic sulphur can exist only in a metastable condition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.]\r\n\r\nOther crystalline forms of sulphur have been obtained,[58] so that the\r\nexistence of other systems of the one-component sulphur besides those\r\nalready described is possible. Reference will be made to these later\r\n(p. 51).\r\n\r\n{41}\r\n\r\nC. _Tin._\r\n\r\nAnother substance capable of existing in more than one crystalline form, is\r\nthe metal tin, and although the general behaviour, so far as studied, is\r\nanalogous to that of sulphur, a short account of the two varieties of tin\r\nmay be given here, not only on account of their metallurgical interest, but\r\nalso on account of the importance which the phenomena possess for the\r\nemployment of this metal in everyday life.\r\n\r\nAfter a winter of extreme severity in Russia (1867-1868), the somewhat\r\nunpleasant discovery was made that a number of blocks of tin, which had\r\nbeen stored in the Customs House at St. Petersburg, had undergone\r\ndisintegration and crumbled to a grey powder.[59] That tin undergoes change\r\non exposure to extreme cold was known, however, before that time, even as\r\nfar back as the time of Aristotle, who spoke of the tin as \"melting.\"[60]\r\nLudicrous as that term may now appear, Aristotle nevertheless unconsciously\r\nemployed a strikingly accurate analogy, for the conditions under which\r\nordinary white tin passes into the grey modification are, in many ways,\r\nquite analogous to those under which a substance passes from the solid to\r\nthe liquid state. The knowledge of this was, however, beyond the wisdom of\r\nthe Greek philosopher.\r\n\r\nFor many years there existed considerable confusion both as to the\r\nconditions under which the transformation of white tin into its allotropic\r\nmodification occurs, and to the reason of the change. Under the guidance of\r\nthe Phase Rule, however, the confusion which obtained has been cleared\r\naway, and the \"mysterious\" behaviour of tin brought into accord with other\r\nphenomena of transformation.[61]\r\n\r\nTransition Point.--Just as in the case of sulphur, so also in the case of\r\ntin, there is a transition point above which the {42} one form, ordinary\r\nwhite tin, and below which the other form, grey tin, is the stable variety.\r\nIn the case of this metal, the transition point was found by Cohen and van\r\nEyk, who employed both the dilatometric and the electrical methods\r\n(Appendix) to be 20deg. Below this temperature, grey tin is the stable\r\nform. But, as we have seen in the case of sulphur, the change of the\r\nmetastable into the stable solid phase occurs with considerable slowness,\r\nand this behaviour is found also in the case of tin. Were it not so, we\r\nshould not be able to use this metal for the many purposes to which it is\r\napplied in everyday life; for, with the exception of a comparatively small\r\nnumber of days in the year, the temperature of our climate is below 20deg,\r\nand _white tin is, therefore, at the ordinary temperature, in a metastable\r\ncondition_. The change, however, into the stable form at the ordinary\r\ntemperature, although slow, nevertheless takes place, as is shown by the\r\npartial or entire conversion of articles of tin which have lain buried for\r\nseveral hundreds of years.\r\n\r\nOn lowering the temperature, the velocity with which the transformation of\r\nthe tin occurs is increased, and Cohen and van Eyk found that the\r\ntemperature of maximum velocity is about -50deg. Contact with the stable\r\nform will, of course, facilitate the transformation.\r\n\r\nThe change of white tin into grey takes place also with increased velocity\r\nin presence of a solution of tin ammonium chloride (pink salt), which is\r\nable to dissolve small quantities of tin. In presence of such a solution\r\nalso, it was found that the temperature at which the velocity of\r\ntransformation was greatest was raised to 0deg. At this temperature, white\r\ntin in contact with a solution of tin ammonium chloride, and the grey\r\nmodification, undergoes transformation to an appreciable extent in the\r\ncourse of a few days.\r\n\r\nFig. 7 is a photograph of a piece of white tin undergoing transformation\r\ninto the grey variety.[62] The bright surface of the tin becomes covered\r\nwith a number of warty masses, formed of the less dense grey form, and the\r\nnumber and size of these continue to grow until the whole of the white tin\r\nhas passed {43} into a grey powder. On account of the appearance which is\r\nhere seen, this transformation of tin has been called by Cohen the \"tin\r\nplague.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.]\r\n\r\n{44}\r\n\r\nEnantiotropy and Monotropy.--In the case of sulphur and tin, we have met\r\nwith two substances existing in polymorphic forms, and we have also learned\r\nthat these forms exhibit a definite transition point at which their\r\nrelative stability is reversed. Each form, therefore, possesses a definite\r\nrange of stable existence, and is capable of undergoing transformation into\r\nthe other, at temperatures above or below that of the transition point.\r\n\r\nAnother class of dimorphous substances is, however, met with as, for\r\ninstance, in the case of the well-known compounds iodine monochloride and\r\nbenzophenone. Each crystalline form has its own melting point, the\r\ndimorphous forms of iodine monochloride melting at 13.9deg and 27.2deg,[63]\r\nand those of benzophenone at 26deg and 48deg.[64] This class of substance\r\ndiffers from that which we have already studied (_e.g._ sulphur and tin),\r\nin that at all temperatures up to the melting point, only one of the forms\r\nis stable, the other being metastable. There is, therefore, no transition\r\npoint, and transformation of the crystalline forms can be observed _only in\r\none direction_. These two classes of phenomena are distinguished by the\r\nnames _enantiotropy_ and _monotropy_; enantiotropic substances being such\r\nthat the change of one form into the other is a reversible process (_e.g._\r\nrhombic sulphur into monoclinic, and monoclinic sulphur into rhombic), and\r\nmonotropic substances, those in which the transformation of the crystalline\r\nforms is irreversible.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.]\r\n\r\nThese differences in the behaviour can be explained very well in many cases\r\nby supposing that in the case of enantiotropic substances the transition\r\npoint lies below the melting point, while in the case of monotropic\r\nsubstances, it lies above the melting point.[65] These conditions would be\r\nrepresented by the Figs. 8 and 9.\r\n\r\nIn these two figures, O_{3} is the transition point, O_{1} and O_{2} the\r\nmelting points of the metastable and stable forms {45} respectively. From\r\nFig. 9 we see that the crystalline form I. at all temperatures up to its\r\nmelting point is metastable with respect to the form II. In such cases the\r\ntransition point could be reached only at higher pressures.\r\n\r\nAlthough, as already stated, this explanation suffices for many cases, it\r\ndoes not prove that in all cases of monotropy the transition point is above\r\nthe melting point of the two forms. It is also quite possible that the\r\ntransition point may lie below the melting points;[66] in this case we have\r\nwhat is known as _pseudomonotropy_. It is possible that graphite and\r\ndiamond,[67] perhaps also the two forms of phosphorus, stand in the\r\nrelation of pseudomonotropy (_v._ p. 49).\r\n\r\nThe disposition of the curves in Figs. 8 and 9 also explains the phenomenon\r\nsometimes met with, especially in organic chemistry, that the substance\r\nfirst melts, then solidifies, and remelts at a higher temperature. On again\r\ndetermining the melting point after re-solidification, only the higher\r\nmelting point is obtained.\r\n\r\nThe explanation of such a behaviour is, that if the determination of the\r\nmelting point is carried out rapidly, the point O_{1}, the melting point of\r\nthe metastable solid form, may be realized. At this temperature, however,\r\nthe liquid is metastable with respect to the stable solid form, and if the\r\ntemperature is {46} not allowed to rise above the melting point of the\r\nlatter, the liquid may solidify. The stable solid modification thus\r\nobtained will melt only at a higher temperature.\r\n\r\nD. _Phosphorus._\r\n\r\nAn interesting case of a monotropic dimorphous substance is found in\r\nphosphorus, which occurs in two crystalline forms; white phosphorus\r\nbelonging to the regular system, and red phosphorus belonging to the\r\nhexagonal system. From determinations of the vapour pressures of liquid\r\nwhite phosphorus, and of solid red phosphorus,[68] it was found that the\r\nvapour pressure of red phosphorus was considerably lower than that of\r\nliquid white phosphorus at the same temperature, the values obtained being\r\ngiven in the following table.\r\n\r\n  VAPOUR PRESSURES OF WHITE AND RED PHOSPHORUS.\r\n\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n    Vapour pressure of liquid white phosphorus.    | Vapour pressure of red\r\n                                                   |     phosphorus.\r\n  -------------------------------------------------+-----------------------\r\n  Temperature.| Pressure | Temperature.|  Pressure | Temperature.| Pressure\r\n              |  in cm.  |             |   in atm. |             |  in atm.\r\n  ------------+----------+-------------+-----------+-------------+---------\r\n   165deg     |  12      |   360deg    |    3.2    |   360deg    |   0.1\r\n   180deg     |  20.4    |   440deg    |    7.5    |   440deg    |   1.75\r\n   200deg     |  26.6    |   494deg    |   18.0    |   487deg    |   6.8\r\n   219deg     |  35.9    |   503deg    |   21.9    |   510deg    |  10.8\r\n   230deg     |  51.4    |   511deg    |   26.2    |   531deg    |  16.0\r\n   290deg     |  76.0    |     --      |     --    |   550deg    |  31.0\r\n    --        |   --     |     --      |     --    |   577deg    |  56.0\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThese values are also represented graphically in Fig. 10.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.]\r\n\r\nAt all temperatures above about 260deg, transformation of the white into\r\nthe red modification takes place with appreciable velocity, and this\r\nvelocity increases as the temperature is raised. Even at lower\r\ntemperatures, _e.g._ at the ordinary temperature, the velocity of\r\ntransformation is increased under the influence {47} of light,[69] or by\r\nthe presence of certain substances, _e.g._ iodine,[70] just as the velocity\r\nof transformation of white tin into the grey modification was increased by\r\nthe presence of a solution of tin ammonium chloride (p. 40). At the\r\nordinary temperature, therefore, white phosphorus must be considered as the\r\nless stable (metastable) form, for although it can exist in contact with\r\nred phosphorus for a long period, its vapour pressure, as we have seen, is\r\ngreater than that of the red modification, and also, its solubility in\r\ndifferent solvents is greater[71] than that of the red modification; as we\r\nshall find later, the solubility of the metastable form is always greater\r\nthan that of the stable.\r\n\r\nThe relationships which are met with in the case of phosphorus can be best\r\nrepresented by the diagram, Fig. 11.[72]\r\n\r\nIn this figure, BO_{1} represents the conditions of equilibrium of the\r\nunivariant system red phosphorus and vapour, which ends at O_{1}, the\r\nmelting point of red phosphorus. By heating in capillary tubes of hard\r\nglass, Chapman[73] found that red phosphorus melts at the melting point of\r\npotassium iodide, _i.e._ about 630deg,[74] but the pressure at this\r\ntemperature is unknown.\r\n\r\nAt O_{1}, then, we have the triple point, red phosphorus, liquid, and\r\nvapour, and starting from it, we should have the {48} vaporization curve of\r\nliquid phosphorus, O_{1}A, and the fusion curve of red phosphorus, O_{1}F.\r\nAlthough these have not been determined, the latter curve must, from\r\ntheoretical considerations (_v._ p. 58), slope slightly to the right;\r\n_i.e._ increase of pressure raises the melting point of red phosphorus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.]\r\n\r\nWhen white phosphorus is heated to 44deg, it melts. At this\r\npoint, therefore, we shall have another triple point, white\r\nphosphorus--liquid--vapour; the pressure at this point has been calculated\r\nto be 3 mm.[75] This point is the intersection of three curves, viz.\r\nsublimation curve, vaporization curve, and the fusion curve of white\r\nphosphorus. The fusion curve, O_{2}E, has been determined by Tammann[76]\r\nand by G. A. Hulett,[77] and it was found that increase of pressure by 1\r\natm. raises the melting point by 0.029deg. The sublimation curve of white\r\nphosphorus has not yet been determined.\r\n\r\nAs can be seen from the table of vapour pressures (p. 46), the vapour\r\npressure of white phosphorus has been determined up to 500deg; at\r\ntemperatures above this, however, the velocity with which transformation\r\ninto red phosphorus takes place is so great as to render the determination\r\nof the vapour pressure {49} at higher temperatures impossible. Since,\r\nhowever, the difference between white phosphorus and red phosphorus\r\ndisappears in the liquid state, the vapour pressure curve of white\r\nphosphorus must pass through the point O_{1}, the melting point of red\r\nphosphorus, and must be continuous with the curve O_{1}A, the vapour\r\npressure curve of liquid phosphorus (_vide infra_). Since, as Fig. 10\r\nshows, the vapour pressure curve of white phosphorus ascends very rapidly\r\nat higher temperatures, the \"break\" between BO_{1} and O_{1}A must be very\r\nslight.\r\n\r\nAs compared with monotropic substances like benzophenone, phosphorus\r\nexhibits the peculiarity that transformation of the metastable into the\r\nstable modification takes place with great slowness; and further, the time\r\nrequired for the production of equilibrium between red phosphorus and\r\nphosphorus vapour is great compared with that required for establishing the\r\nsame equilibrium in the case of white phosphorus. This behaviour can be\r\nbest explained by the assumption that change in the molecular complexity\r\n(polymerization) occurs in the conversion of white into red phosphorus, and\r\nwhen red phosphorus passes into vapour (depolymerization).[78]\r\n\r\nThis is borne out by the fact that measurements of the vapour density of\r\nphosphorus vapour at temperatures of 500deg and more, show it to have the\r\nmolecular weight represented by P_{4},[79] and the same molecular weight\r\nhas been found for phosphorus in solution.[80] On the other hand, it has\r\nrecently been shown by R. Schenck,[81] that the molecular weight of red\r\nphosphorus is at least P_{8}, and very possibly higher.\r\n\r\nIn the case of phosphorus, therefore, it is more than possible that we are\r\ndealing, not simply with two polymorphic {50} forms of the same substance,\r\nbut with polymeric forms, and that there is no transition point at\r\ntemperatures above the absolute zero, unless we assume the molecular\r\ncomplexity of the two forms to become the same. The curve for red\r\nphosphorus would therefore lie below that of white phosphorus, for the\r\nvapour pressure of the polymeric form, if produced from the simpler form\r\nwith evolution of heat, must be lower than that of the latter. A transition\r\npoint would, of course, become possible if the sign of the heat effect in\r\nthe transformation of the one modification into the other should change.\r\nIf, further, the liquid which is produced by the fusion of red phosphorus\r\nat 630deg under high pressure also exists in a polymeric form, greater than\r\nP_{4}, then the metastable vaporization curve of white phosphorus would not\r\npass through the melting point of red phosphorus, as was assumed above.[82]\r\n\r\nWe have already seen in the case of water (p. 31) that the vapour pressure\r\nof supercooled water is greater than that of ice, and that therefore it is\r\npossible, theoretically at least, by a process of distillation, to transfer\r\nthe water from one end of a closed tube to the other, and to there condense\r\nit as ice. On account of the very small difference between the vapour\r\npressure of supercooled water and ice, this distillation process has not\r\nbeen experimentally realized. In the case of phosphorus, however, where the\r\ndifference in the vapour pressures is comparatively great, it has been\r\nfound possible to distil white phosphorus from one part of a closed tube to\r\nanother, and to there condense it as red phosphorus; and since the vapour\r\npressure of red phosphorus at 350deg is less than the vapour pressure of\r\nwhite phosphorus at 200deg, it is possible to carry out the distillation\r\nfrom a _colder_ part of the tube to a _hotter_, by having white phosphorus\r\nat the former and red phosphorus at the latter. Such a process of\r\ndistillation has been carried out by Troost and Hautefeuille between 324deg\r\nand 350deg.[83]\r\n\r\nRelationships similar to those found in the case of phosphorus are also met\r\nwith in the case of cyanogen and {51} paracyanogen, which have been studied\r\nby Chappuis,[84] Troost and Hautefeuille,[85] and Dewar,[86] and also in\r\nthe case of other organic substances.\r\n\r\nEnantiotropy combined with Monotropy.--Not only can polymorphic substances\r\nexhibit enantiotropy or monotropy, but, if the substance is capable of\r\nexisting in more than two crystalline forms, both relationships may be\r\nfound, so that some of the forms may be enantiotropic to one another, while\r\nthe other forms exhibit only monotropy. This behaviour is seen in the case\r\nof sulphur, which can exist in as many as eight different crystalline\r\nvarieties. Of these only monoclinic and rhombic sulphur exhibit the\r\nrelationship of enantiotropy, _i.e._ they possess a definite transition\r\npoint, while the other forms are all metastable with respect to rhombic and\r\nmonoclinic sulphur, and remain so up to the melting point; that is to say,\r\nthey are monotropic modifications.[87]\r\n\r\nE. _Liquid Crystals._\r\n\r\nPhenomena observed.--In 1888 it was discovered by Reinitzer[88] that the\r\ntwo substances, cholesteryl acetate and cholesteryl benzoate, possess the\r\npeculiar property of melting sharply at a definite temperature to milky\r\nliquids; and that the latter, on being further heated, suddenly become\r\nclear, also at a definite temperature. Other substances, more especially\r\n_p_-azoxyanisole and _p_-azoxyphenetole, were, later, found to possess the\r\nsame property of having apparently a double melting point.[89] On cooling\r\nthe clear liquids, the reverse series of changes occurred.\r\n\r\nThe turbid liquids which were thus obtained were found to possess not only\r\nthe usual properties of liquids (such as the {52} property of flowing and\r\nof assuming a perfectly spherical shape when suspended in a liquid of the\r\nsame density), but also those properties which had hitherto been observed\r\nonly in the case of solid crystalline substances, viz. the property of\r\ndouble refraction and of giving interference colours when examined by\r\npolarized light; the turbid liquids are _anisotropic_. To such liquids, the\r\noptical properties of which were discovered by O. Lehmann,[90] the name\r\n_liquid crystals_, or crystalline liquids, was given.\r\n\r\nNature of Liquid Crystals.--During the past ten years the question as to\r\nthe nature of liquid crystals has been discussed by a number of\r\ninvestigators, several of whom have contended strongly against the idea of\r\nthe term \"liquid\" being applied to the crystalline condition; and various\r\nattempts have been made to prove that the turbid liquids are in reality\r\nheterogeneous and are to be classed along with emulsions.[91] This view was\r\nno doubt largely suggested by the fact that the anisotropic liquids were\r\nturbid, whereas the \"solid\" crystals were clear. Lehmann found, however,\r\nthat, when examined under the microscope, the \"simple\" liquid crystals were\r\nalso clear,[92] the apparent turbidity being due to the aggregation of a\r\nnumber of differently oriented crystals, in the same way as a piece of\r\nmarble does not appear transparent although composed of transparent\r\ncrystals.[93]\r\n\r\nFurther, no proof of the heterogeneity of liquid crystals has yet been\r\nobtained, but rather all chemical and physical investigations indicate that\r\nthey are homogeneous.[94] No separation {53} of a solid substance from the\r\nmilky, anisotropic liquids has been effected; the anisotropic liquid is in\r\nsome cases less viscous than the isotropic liquid formed at a higher\r\ntemperature; and the temperature of liquefaction is constant, and is\r\naffected by pressure and admixture with foreign substances exactly as in\r\nthe case of a pure substance.[95]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12.]\r\n\r\nEquilibrium Relations in the Case of Liquid Crystals.--Since, now, we have\r\nseen that we are dealing here with substances in two crystalline forms\r\n(which we may call the solid and liquid[96] crystalline form), which\r\npossess a definite transition point, at which, transformation of the one\r\nform into the other occurs in both directions, we can represent the\r\nconditions of equilibrium by a diagram in all respects similar to that\r\nemployed in the case of other enantiotropic substances, _e.g._ sulphur\r\n(p. 35).\r\n\r\n{54}\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 12 there is given a diagrammatic representation of the\r\nrelationships found in the case of _p_-azoxyanisole.[97]\r\n\r\nAlthough the vapour pressure of the substance in the solid, or liquid\r\nstate, has not been determined, it will be understood from what we have\r\nalready learned, that the curves AO, OB, BC, representing the vapour\r\npressure of solid crystals, liquid crystals, isotropic liquid, must have\r\nthe relative positions shown in the diagram. Point O, the transition point\r\nof the solid into the liquid crystals, lies at 118.27deg, and the change of\r\nthe transition point with the pressure is +0.032deg pro 1 atm. The\r\ntransition curve OE slopes, therefore, slightly to the right. The point B,\r\nthe melting point of the liquid crystals, lies at 135.85deg, and the\r\nmelting point is raised 0.0485deg pro 1 atm. The curve BD, therefore, also\r\nslopes to the right, and more so than the transition curve. In this respect\r\nazoxyanisole is different from sulphur.\r\n\r\nThe areas bounded by the curves represent the conditions for the stable\r\nexistence of the four single phases, solid crystals, liquid crystals,\r\nisotropic liquid and vapour.\r\n\r\nThe most important substances hitherto found to form liquid crystals\r\nare[98]:--\r\n\r\n  ----------------------------------+------------+--------\r\n                                    |            |\r\n          Substance.                | Transition | Melting\r\n                                    |   point.   | point.\r\n  ----------------------------------+------------+--------\r\n                                    |            |\r\n  Cholesteryl benzoate              |  145.5deg  | 178.5deg\r\n  Azoxyanisole                      |  118.3deg  | 135.9deg\r\n  Azoxyphenetole                    |  134.5deg  | 168.1deg\r\n  Condensation product from         |            |\r\n   benzaldehyde and benzidine       |  234deg    | 260deg\r\n  Azine of _p_-oxyethylbenzaldehyde |  172deg    | 196deg\r\n  Condensation product from         |            |\r\n   _p_-tolylaldehyde and benzidine  |  231deg    |   --\r\n  _p_-Methoxycinnamic acid          |  169deg    | 185deg\r\n  ----------------------------------+------------+--------\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{55}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nGENERAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nIn the preceding pages we have learned how the principles of the Phase Rule\r\ncan be applied to the elucidation of various systems consisting of one\r\ncomponent. In the present chapter it is proposed to give a short summary of\r\nthe relationships we have met with, and also to discuss more generally how\r\nthe Phase Rule applies to other one-component systems. On account of the\r\nfact that beginners are sometimes inclined to expect too much of the Phase\r\nRule; to expect, for example, that it will inform them as to the exact\r\nbehaviour of a substance, it may here be emphasized that the Phase Rule is\r\na general rule; it informs us only as to the general conditions of\r\nequilibrium, and leaves the determination of the definite, numerical data\r\nto experiment.\r\n\r\nTriple Point.--We have already (p. 28) defined a triple point in a\r\none-component system, as being that pressure and temperature at which three\r\nphases coexist in equilibrium; it represents, therefore, an invariant\r\nsystem (p. 16). At the triple point also, three curves cut, viz. the curves\r\nrepresenting the conditions of equilibrium of the three univariant systems\r\nformed by the combination of the three phases in pairs. The most common\r\ntriple point of a one-component system is, of course, the triple point,\r\nsolid, liquid, vapour (S-L-V), but other triple points[99] are also\r\npossible when, as in the case of {56} sulphur or benzophenone, polymorphic\r\nforms occur. Whether or not all the triple points can be experimentally\r\nrealized will, of course, depend on circumstances. We shall, in the first\r\nplace, consider only the triple point S-L-V.\r\n\r\nAs to the general arrangement of the three univariant curves around the\r\ntriple point, the following rules may be given. (1) The prolongation of\r\neach of the curves beyond the triple point must lie between the other two\r\ncurves. (2) The middle position at one and the same temperature in the\r\nneighbourhood of the triple point is taken by that curve (or its metastable\r\nprolongation) which represents the two phases of most widely differing\r\nspecific volume.[100] That is to say, if a line of constant temperature is\r\ndrawn immediately above or below the triple point so as to cut the three\r\ncurves--two stable curves and the metastable prolongation of the third--the\r\nposition of the curves at that temperature will be such that the middle\r\nposition is occupied by that curve (or its metastable prolongation) which\r\nrepresents the two phases of most widely differing specific volume.\r\n\r\nNow, although these rules admit of a considerable variety of possible\r\narrangements of curves around the triple point,[101] only two of these have\r\nbeen experimentally obtained in the case of the triple point\r\nsolid--liquid--vapour. At present, therefore, we shall consider only these\r\ntwo cases (Figs. 13 and 14).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14.]\r\n\r\nAn examination of these two figures shows that they satisfy the rules laid\r\ndown. Each of the curves on being prolonged passes between the other two\r\ncurves. In the case of substances of the first type (Fig. 13), the specific\r\nvolume of the solid is greater than that of the liquid (the substance\r\ncontracts on fusion); the difference of specific volume will, therefore, be\r\ngreatest between liquid and vapour. The curve, therefore, for liquid and\r\nvapour (or its prolongation) must lie between the other two curves; this is\r\nseen from the figure to be the case. Similarly, the rule is satisfied by\r\nthe arrangement of curves in Fig. 14, where the difference of specific\r\nvolumes is {57} greatest between the solid and vapour. In this case the\r\ncurve S-V occupies the intermediate position.\r\n\r\nAs we see, the two figures differ from one another only in that the fusion\r\ncurve OC in one case slopes to the right away from the pressure axis, thus\r\nindicating that the melting point is raised by increase of pressure; in the\r\nother case, to the left, indicating a lowering of the melting point with\r\nthe pressure. These conditions are found exemplified in the case of sulphur\r\nand ice (pp. 29 and 35). We see further from the two figures, that O in\r\nFig. 13 gives the highest temperature at which the solid can exist, for the\r\ncurve for solid--liquid slopes back to regions of lower temperature; in\r\nFig. 14, O gives the lowest temperature at which the liquid phase can exist\r\nas stable phase.[102]\r\n\r\nTheorems of van't Hoff and of Le Chatelier.--So far we have studied only\r\nthe conditions under which various systems exist in equilibrium; and we now\r\npass to a consideration of the changes which take place in a system when\r\nthe external conditions of temperature and pressure are altered. For all\r\nsuch changes there exist two theorems, based on the laws of thermodynamics,\r\nby means of which the alterations in a system can be qualitatively\r\npredicted.[103] The first of these, usually {58} known as van't Hoff's _law\r\nof movable equilibrium_,[104] states: When the temperature of a system in\r\nequilibrium is raised, that reaction takes place which is accompanied by\r\nabsorption of heat; and, conversely, when the temperature is lowered, that\r\nreaction occurs which is accompanied by an evolution of heat.\r\n\r\nThe second of the two theorems refers to the effect of change of pressure,\r\nand states:[105] When the pressure on a system in equilibrium is increased,\r\nthat reaction takes place which is accompanied by a diminution of volume;\r\nand when the pressure is diminished, a reaction ensues which is accompanied\r\nby an increase of volume.\r\n\r\nThe demonstration of the universal applicability of these two theorems is\r\ndue chiefly to Le Chatelier, who showed that they may be regarded as\r\nconsequences of the general law of action and reaction. For this reason\r\nthey are generally regarded as special cases of the more general law, known\r\nas the _theorem of Le Chatelier_, which may be stated in the words of\r\nOstwald, as follows:[106] _If a system in equilibrium is subjected to a\r\nconstraint by which the equilibrium is shifted, a reaction takes place\r\nwhich opposes the constraint, _i.e._ one by which its effect is partially\r\ndestroyed._\r\n\r\nThis theorem of Le Chatelier is of very great importance, for it applies to\r\nall systems and changes of the condition of equilibrium, whether physical\r\nor chemical; to vaporization and fusion; to solution and chemical action.\r\nIn all cases, whenever changes in the external condition of a system in\r\nequilibrium are produced, processes also occur within the system which tend\r\nto counteract the effect of the external changes.\r\n\r\n_Changes at the Triple Point._--If now we apply this theorem to equilibria\r\nat the triple point S-L-V, and ask what changes will occur in such a system\r\nwhen the external conditions of pressure and temperature are altered, the\r\ngeneral answer to the question will be: So long as the three phases are\r\npresent, no {59} change in the temperature or pressure of the system can\r\noccur, but _only changes in the relative amounts of the phases_; that is to\r\nsay, the effect on the system of change in the external conditions is\r\nopposed by the reactions or changes which take place within the system\r\n(according to the theorems of van't Hoff and Le Chatelier). We now proceed\r\nto discuss what these changes are, and shall consider first the effect of\r\nalteration of the temperature at constant volume and constant pressure, and\r\nthen the effect of alteration of the pressure both when the temperature\r\nremains constant and when it varies.\r\n\r\nWhen the volume is kept constant, the effect of the addition of heat to a\r\nsystem at the triple point S-L-V differs somewhat according as there is an\r\nincrease or diminution of volume when the solid passes into the liquid\r\nstate. In the former and most general case (Fig. 14), addition of heat will\r\ncause a certain amount of the solid phase to melt, whereby the heat which\r\nis added becomes latent; the temperature of the system therefore does not\r\nrise. Since, however, the melting of the solid is accompanied by an\r\nincrease of volume, whereby an increase of pressure would result, a certain\r\nportion of the vapour must condense to liquid, in order that the pressure\r\nmay remain constant. The total effect of addition of heat, therefore, is to\r\ncause both solid and vapour to pass into liquid, _i.e._ there occurs the\r\nchange S + V --> L. It will, therefore, depend on the relative quantities\r\nof solid and vapour, which will disappear first. If the solid disappears\r\nfirst, then we shall pass to the system L-V; if vapour disappears first, we\r\nshall obtain the system S-L. Withdrawal of heat causes the reverse change,\r\nL --> S + V; at all temperatures below the triple point the liquid is\r\nunstable or metastable (p. 30).\r\n\r\nWhen fusion is accompanied by a diminution of volume (_e.g._ ice, Fig. 13),\r\nthen, since the melting of the solid phase would decrease the total volume,\r\n_i.e._ would lower the pressure, a certain quantity of the solid must also\r\npass into vapour in order that the pressure may be maintained constant. On\r\naddition of heat, therefore, there occurs the reaction S --> L + V;\r\nwithdrawal of heat causes the reverse change L + V --> S. Above the\r\ntemperature of the triple point the {60} solid cannot exist; below the\r\ntriple point both systems, S-L and S-V, can exist, and it will therefore\r\ndepend on the relative amounts of liquid and vapour which of these two\r\nsystems is obtained on withdrawing heat from the system at constant volume.\r\n\r\nThe same changes in the phases occur when heat is added or withdrawn at\r\nconstant pressure, so long as the three phases are present. Continued\r\naddition of heat, however, at constant pressure will ultimately cause the\r\nformation of the bivariant system vapour alone; continued withdrawal of\r\nheat will ultimately cause the formation of solid alone. This will be\r\nreadily understood from Fig. 15. The dotted line D'OD is a line of constant\r\npressure; on adding heat, the system passes along the line OD into the\r\nregion of vapour; on heat being withdrawn, the system passes along OD' into\r\nthe area of solid.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15.]\r\n\r\nSimilar changes are produced when the volume of the system is altered.\r\nAlteration of volume may take place either while transference of heat to or\r\nfrom the system is cut off (adiabatic change), or while such transference\r\nmay occur (isothermal change). In the latter case, the temperature of the\r\nsystem will remain constant; in the former case, since at the triple point\r\nthe pressure must be constant so long as the three phases are present,\r\nincrease of volume must be compensated by the evaporation of liquid. This,\r\nhowever, would cause the temperature to fall (since communication of heat\r\nfrom the outside is supposed to be cut off), and a portion of the liquid\r\nmust therefore freeze. In this way the latent heat of evaporation is\r\ncounterbalanced by the latent heat of fusion. As the result of increase of\r\nvolume, therefore, the process occurs L --> S + V. Diminution of volume,\r\nwithout transference of heat, will bring about the opposite change, S + V\r\n--> L. In the former case there is ultimately obtained the univariant\r\nsystem S-V; in the latter case there will be {61} obtained either S-L or\r\nL-V according as the vapour or solid phase disappears first.\r\n\r\nThis argument holds good for both types of triple point shown in Figs. 13\r\nand 14 (p. 57). A glance at these figures will show that increase of volume\r\n(diminution of pressure) will lead ultimately to the system S-V, for at\r\npressures lower than that of the triple point, the liquid phase cannot\r\nexist. Decrease of volume (increase of pressure), on the other hand, will\r\nlead either to the system S-L or L-V, because these systems can exist at\r\npressures higher than that of the triple point. If the vapour phase\r\ndisappears and we pass to the curve S-L, continued diminution of volume\r\nwill be accompanied by a fall in temperature in the case of systems of the\r\nfirst type (Fig. 13), and by a rise in temperature in the case of systems\r\nof the second type (Fig. 14).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17.]\r\n\r\nLastly, if the temperature is maintained constant, _i.e._ if heat can pass\r\ninto or out of the system, then on changing the volume the same changes in\r\nthe phases will take place as described above until one of the phases has\r\ndisappeared. Continued increase of volume (decrease of pressure) will then\r\ncause the disappearance of a second phase, the system passing along the\r\ndotted line OE' (Figs. 16, 17), so that ultimately there remains only the\r\nvapour phase. Conversely, diminution of volume (increase of pressure) will\r\nultimately lead either to solid (Fig. 16) or to liquid alone (Fig. 17), the\r\nsystem passing along the dotted line OE. {62}\r\n\r\nIn discussing the alterations which may take place at the triple point with\r\nchange of temperature and pressure, we have considered only the triple\r\npoint S-L-V. The same reasoning, however, applies, _mutatis mutandis_, to\r\nall other triple points, so that if the specific volumes of the phases are\r\nknown, and the sign of the heat effects which accompany the transformation\r\nof one phase into the other, it is possible to predict (by means of the\r\ntheorem of Le Chatelier) the changes which will be produced in the system\r\nby alteration of the pressure and temperature.\r\n\r\nIn all cases of transformation at the triple point, it should be noted that\r\nall _three phases are involved in the change_,[107] and not two only; the\r\nfact that in the case, say, of the transformation from solid to liquid, or\r\nliquid to solid, at the melting point with change of temperature, only\r\nthese two phases appear to be affected, is due to there generally being a\r\nlarge excess of the vapour phase present and to the prior disappearance\r\ntherefore of the solid or liquid phase.\r\n\r\nIn the case of triple points at which two solid phases are in equilibrium\r\nwith liquid, other arrangements of the curves around the triple point are\r\nfound. It is, however, unnecessary to give a general treatment of these\r\nhere, since the principles which have been applied to the triple point\r\nS-L-V can also be applied to the other triple points.[108]\r\n\r\nTriple Point Solid--Solid--Vapour.--The triple point solid--solid--vapour\r\nis one which is of considerable importance. Examples of such a triple point\r\nhave already been given in sulphur and tin, and a list of other substances\r\ncapable of yielding two solid phases is given below. The triple point S-S-V\r\nis not precisely the same as the transition point, but is very nearly so.\r\nThe transition point is the temperature at which the relative stability of\r\nthe two solid phases undergoes change, when the vapour phase is absent and\r\nthe pressure is 1 atm.; whereas at the triple point the pressure is that of\r\nthe system itself. The transition point, therefore, bears the same relation\r\nto the triple point S-S-V as the melting point to the triple point S-L-V.\r\n\r\n{63}\r\n\r\nIn the following table is given a list of the most important polymorphous\r\nsubstances, and the temperatures of the transition point.[109]\r\n\r\n  ------------------------------------+-------------\r\n                                      |\r\n              Substance.              |  Transition\r\n                                      | temperature.\r\n  ------------------------------------+-------------\r\n                                      |\r\n  Ammonium nitrate--                  |\r\n   [beta]-rhombic --> [alpha]-rhombic |     35deg\r\n   [alpha]-rhombic --> rhombohedral   |     83deg\r\n   Rhombohedral --> regular           |    125deg\r\n  Mercuric iodide                     |    126deg\r\n  Potassium nitrate                   |    129deg\r\n  Silver iodide                       |    145deg\r\n  Silver nitrate                      |    160deg\r\n  Sulphur                             |     95.5deg\r\n  Tetrabrommethane                    |     46.8deg\r\n  Thallium nitrate--                  |\r\n   Rhombic --> rhombohedral           |     80deg\r\n   Rhombohedral --> regular           |    142.5deg\r\n  Thallium picrate                    |     46deg\r\n  Tin                                 |     20deg\r\n  ------------------------------------+-------------\r\n\r\nSublimation and Vaporization Curves.--We have already seen, in the case of\r\nice and liquid water, that the vapour pressure increases as the temperature\r\nrises, the increase of pressure per degree being greater the higher the\r\ntemperature. The sublimation and vaporization curves, therefore, are not\r\nstraight lines, but are bent, the convex side of the curve being towards\r\nthe temperature axis in the ordinary _pt_-diagram.\r\n\r\nIn the case of sulphur and of tin, we assumed vapour to be given off by the\r\nsolid substance, although the pressure of the vapour has not hitherto been\r\nmeasured. The assumption, however, is entirely justified, not only on\r\ntheoretical grounds, but also because the existence of a vapour pressure\r\nhas been observed in the case of many solid substances at temperatures much\r\nbelow the melting point,[110] and in some cases, _e.g._ camphor,[111] the\r\nvapour pressure is considerable.\r\n\r\n{64}\r\n\r\nAs the result of a large number of determinations, it has been found that\r\nall vapour pressure curves have the same general form alluded to above.\r\nAttempts have also been made to obtain a general expression for the\r\nquantitative changes in the vapour pressure with change of temperature, but\r\nwithout success. Nevertheless, the _qualitative_ changes, or the general\r\ndirection of the curves, can be predicted by means of the theorem of Le\r\nChatelier.\r\n\r\nAs we have already learned (p. 16), the Phase Rule takes no account of the\r\nmolecular complexity of the substances participating in an equilibrium. A\r\ndissociating substance, therefore, in contact with its vaporous products of\r\ndissociation (_e.g._ ammonium chloride in contact with ammonia and hydrogen\r\nchloride), will likewise constitute a univariant system of one component,\r\nprovided the composition of the vapour phase as a whole is the same as that\r\nof the solid or liquid phase (p. 13). For all such substances, therefore,\r\nthe conditions of equilibrium will be represented by a curve of the same\r\ngeneral form as the vapour pressure curve of a non-dissociating\r\nsubstance.[112] The same behaviour is also found in the case of substances\r\nwhich polymerize on passing into the solid or liquid state (_e.g._ red\r\nphosphorus). Where such changes in the molecular state occur, however, the\r\ntime required for equilibrium to be established is, as a rule, greater than\r\nwhen the molecular state is the same in both phases.\r\n\r\nFrom an examination of Figs. 13 and 14, it will be easy to predict the\r\neffect of change of pressure and temperature on the univariant systems S-V\r\nor L-V. If the volume is kept constant, addition of heat will cause an\r\nincrease of pressure, the system S-V moving along the curve AO until at the\r\ntriple point the liquid phase is formed, and the system L-V moving along\r\nthe curve OB; so long as two phases are present, the condition of the\r\nsystem must be represented by these two curves. Conversely, withdrawal of\r\nheat will cause condensation of vapour, and therefore diminution of\r\npressure; the system will therefore move along the vaporization or\r\nsublimation curve to lower temperatures and pressures, so long as the\r\nsystem remains univariant.\r\n\r\n{65}\r\n\r\nIf transference of heat to or from the system is prevented, increase of\r\nvolume (diminution of pressure) will cause the system L-V to pass along the\r\ncurve BO; liquid will pass into vapour and the temperature will fall.[113]\r\nAt O solid may appear, and the temperature of the system will then remain\r\nconstant until the liquid phase has disappeared (p. 57); the system will\r\nthen follow the curve OA until the solid phase disappears, and we are\r\nultimately left with vapour. On the other hand, diminution of volume\r\n(increase of pressure) will cause condensation of vapour, and the system\r\nS-V will pass along the curve AO to higher temperatures and pressures; at O\r\nthe solid will melt, and the system will ultimately pass to the curve OB or\r\nto OC (p. 57).\r\n\r\nAddition or withdrawal of heat at constant pressure, and increase or\r\ndiminution of the pressure at constant temperature, will cause the system\r\nto pass along lines parallel to the temperature and the pressure axis\r\nrespectively; the working out of these changes may be left to the reader,\r\nguided by what has been said on pp. 60 and 61.\r\n\r\nThe sublimation curve of all substances, so far as yet found, has its upper\r\nlimit at the melting point (triple point), although the possibility of the\r\nexistence of a superheated solid is not excluded. The lower limit is,\r\ntheoretically at least, at the absolute zero, provided no new phase, _e.g._\r\na different crystalline modification, is formed. If the sublimation\r\npressure of a substance is greater than the atmospheric pressure at any\r\ntemperature below the point of fusion, then the substance will _sublime\r\nwithout melting_ when heated in an open vessel; and fusion will be possible\r\nonly at a pressure higher than the atmospheric. This is found, for example,\r\nin the case of red phosphorus (p. 47). If, however, the sublimation\r\npressure of a substance at its triple point S-L-V is less than one\r\natmosphere, then the substance will melt when heated in an open vessel.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the vaporization curve, the upper limit lies at the critical\r\npoint where the liquid ceases to exist;[114] the {66} lower limit is\r\ndetermined by the range of the metastable state of the supercooled liquid.\r\n\r\nThe interpolation and extrapolation of vapour-pressure curves is rendered\r\nvery easy by means of a relationship which Ramsay and Young[115] found to\r\nexist between the vapour-pressure curves of different substances. It was\r\nobserved that in the case of closely related substances, the ratio of the\r\nabsolute temperatures corresponding to equal vapour pressures is constant,\r\n_i.e._ T_{1}/T'_{1} = T_{2}/T'_{2}. When the two substances are not closely\r\nrelated, it was found that the relationship could be expressed by the\r\nequation T_{1}/T'_{1} = T_{2}/T'_{2} + _c_(_t_' - _t_) where _c_ is a\r\nconstant having a small positive or negative value, and _t_' and _t_ are\r\nthe temperatures at which one of the substances has the two values of the\r\nvapour pressure in question. By means of this equation, if the\r\nvapour-pressure curve of one substance is known, the vapour-pressure curve\r\nof any other substance can be calculated from the values at any two\r\ntemperatures of the vapour pressure of that substance.\r\n\r\nFusion Curve--Transition Curve.--The fusion curve represents the conditions\r\nof equilibrium between the solid and liquid phase; it shows the change of\r\nthe melting point of a substance with change of pressure.\r\n\r\nAs shown in Figs. 13 and 14, the fusion curve is inclined either towards\r\nthe pressure axis or away from it; that is, increase of pressure can either\r\nlower or raise the melting point. It is easy to predict in a qualitative\r\nmanner the different effect of pressure on the melting point in the two\r\ncases mentioned, if we consider the matter in the light of the theorem of\r\nLe Chatelier (p. 58). Water, on passing into ice, expands; therefore, if\r\nthe pressure on the system ice--water be increased, a reaction will take\r\nplace which is accompanied by a diminution in volume, _i.e._ the ice will\r\nmelt. Consequently, a lower temperature will be required in order to\r\ncounteract the effect of increase of pressure; or, in other words, the\r\nmelting point will {67} be lowered by pressure.[116] In the second case,\r\nthe passage of the liquid to the solid state is accompanied by a diminution\r\nof volume; the effect of increase of pressure will therefore be the reverse\r\nof that in the previous case.\r\n\r\nIf the value of the heat of fusion and the alteration of volume\r\naccompanying the change of state are known, it is possible to calculate\r\n_quantitatively_ the effect of pressure.[117]\r\n\r\nWe have already seen (p. 25) that the effect of pressure on the melting\r\npoint of a substance was predicted as the result of theoretical\r\nconsiderations, and was first proved experimentally in the case of ice.\r\nSoon after, Bunsen[118] showed that the melting point of other substances\r\nis also affected by pressure; and in more recent years, ample experimental\r\nproof of the change of the melting point with the pressure has been\r\nobtained. The change of the melting point is, however, small; as a rule,\r\nincrease of pressure by 1 atm. changes the melting point by about 0.03deg,\r\nbut in the case of water the change is much less (0.0076deg), and in the\r\ncase of camphor much more (0.13deg). In other words, if we take the mean\r\ncase, an increase of pressure of more than 30 atm. is required to produce a\r\nchange in the melting point of 1deg.\r\n\r\nInvestigations which were made of the influence of pressure on the\r\nmelting-point, showed that up to pressures of several hundred atmospheres\r\nthe fusion curve is a straight line.[119] Tammann[120] has, however, found\r\nthat on increasing the pressure the fusion curve no longer remains\r\nstraight, but bends towards the pressure axis, so that, on sufficiently\r\nincreasing the pressure, a maximum temperature might at length be reached.\r\nThis maximum has, so far, however, not been attained, although the melting\r\npoint curves of various substances have been studied up to pressures of\r\n4500 atm. This is to be accounted for partly {68} by the fact that the\r\nprobable maximum temperature in the case of most substances lies at very\r\ngreat pressures, and also by the fact that other solid phases make their\r\nappearance, as, for example, in the case of ice (p. 32).\r\n\r\nAs to the upper limit of the fusion curve, the view has been expressed[121]\r\nthat just as in the case of liquid and vapour, so also in the case of solid\r\nand liquid, there exists a critical point at which the solid and the liquid\r\nphase become identical. Experimental evidence, however, does not appear to\r\nfavour this view.[122]\r\n\r\nThe _transition point_, like the melting point, is also influenced by the\r\npressure, and in this case also it is found that pressure may either raise\r\nor lower the transition point, so that the transition curve may be inclined\r\neither away from or towards the pressure axis. The direction of the\r\ntransition curve can also be predicted if the change of volume accompanying\r\nthe passage of one form into the other is known. In the case of sulphur, we\r\nsaw that the transition point is raised by increase of pressure; in the\r\ncase of the transition of rhombohedral into [alpha]-rhombic form of\r\nammonium nitrate, however, the transition point is lowered by pressure, as\r\nshown by the following table.[123]\r\n\r\n  -------------+----------\r\n               |\r\n  Temperature. | Pressure.\r\n  -------------+----------\r\n               |\r\n    85.85deg   |   1 atm.\r\n    84.38deg   | 100  \"\r\n    83.03deg   | 200  \"\r\n    82.29deg   | 250  \"\r\n  -------------+----------\r\n\r\nSo far as investigations have been carried out, it appears that in most\r\ncases the transition curve is practically a straight line.\r\n\r\nIt has, however, been found in the case of Glauber's salt, that with\r\nincrease of pressure the transition curve passes through a point of maximum\r\ntemperature, and exhibits, therefore, a form similar to that assumed by\r\nTammann for the fusion curve.[124]\r\n\r\n{69}\r\n\r\nSuspended Transformation. Metastable Equilibria.--Hitherto we have\r\nconsidered only systems in stable equilibrium. We have, however, already\r\nseen, in the case of water, that on cooling the liquid down to the triple\r\npoint, solidification did not necessarily take place, although the\r\nconditions were such as to allow of its formation. Similarly, we saw that\r\nrhombic sulphur can be heated above the transition point, and monoclinic\r\nsulphur can be obtained at temperatures below the transition point,\r\nalthough in both cases transformation into a more stable form is possible;\r\nthe system becomes metastable.\r\n\r\nThe same reluctance to form a new phase is observed also in the phenomena\r\nof superheating of liquids, and in the \"hanging\" of mercury in barometers,\r\nin which case the vapour phase is not formed. In general, then, we may say\r\nthat _a new phase will not necessarily be formed immediately the system\r\npasses into such a condition that the existence of that phase is possible_;\r\nbut rather, instead of the system undergoing transformation so as to pass\r\ninto the most stable condition under the existing pressure and temperature,\r\nthis transformation will be \"suspended\" or delayed, and the system will\r\nbecome metastable. Only in the case of the formation of the liquid from the\r\nsolid phase, in a one-component system, has this reluctance to form a new\r\nphase not been observed.\r\n\r\n_To ensure the formation of the new phase, it is necessary to have that\r\nphase present._ The presence of the solid phase will prevent the\r\nsupercooling of the liquid; and the presence of the vapour phase will\r\nprevent the superheating of the liquid. However, even in the presence of\r\nthe more stable phase, transformation of the metastable phase occurs with\r\nvery varying velocity; in some cases so quickly as to appear almost\r\ninstantaneous; while in other cases, the change takes place so slowly as to\r\nrequire hundreds of years for its achievement. It is this slow rate of\r\ntransformation that renders the existence of metastable forms possible,\r\nwhen in contact with the more stable phase. Thus, for example, although\r\ncalcite is the most stable form of calcium carbonate at the ordinary\r\ntemperature,[125] the less stable {70} modification, aragonite,\r\nnevertheless exists under the ordinary conditions in an apparently very\r\nstable state.\r\n\r\nAs to the amount of the new phase required to bring about the\r\ntransformation of the metastable phase, quantitative measurements have been\r\ncarried out only in the case of the initiation of crystallization in a\r\nsupercooled liquid.[126] As the result of these investigations, it was\r\nfound that, in the case of superfused salol, the very small amount of 1 x\r\n10^{-7} gm. of the solid phase was sufficient to induce crystallization.\r\nCrystallization of a supercooled liquid, however, can be initiated only by\r\na \"nucleus\" of the same substance in the solid state, or, as has also been\r\nfound, by a nucleus of an isomorphous solid phase; it is not brought about\r\nby the presence of any chance solid.\r\n\r\nVelocity of Transformation.--Attention has already been drawn to the\r\nsluggishness with which reciprocal transformation of the polymorphic forms\r\nof a substance may occur. In the case of tin, for example, it was found\r\nthat the white modification, although apparently possessing permanence, is\r\nin reality in a metastable state, under the ordinary conditions of\r\ntemperature and pressure. This great degree of stability is due to the\r\ntardiness with which transformation into the grey form occurs.\r\n\r\nWhat was found in the case of tin, is met with also in the case of all\r\ntransformations in the solid state, but the velocity of the change is less\r\nin some cases than in others, and appears to decrease with increase of the\r\nvalency of the element.[127] To this fact van't Hoff attributes the great\r\npermanence of many really unstable (or metastable) carbon compounds.\r\n\r\nReference has been made to the fact that the velocity of transformation can\r\nbe accelerated by various means. One of the most important of these is the\r\nemployment of a liquid which has a solvent action on the solid phases. Just\r\nas we have seen that at any given temperature the less stable form has the\r\nhigher vapour pressure, but that at the transition point the vapour\r\npressure of both forms becomes identical, so also it can be proved\r\ntheoretically, and be shown experimentally, that {71} at a given\r\ntemperature the solubility of the less stable form is greater than that of\r\nthe more stable, but that at the transition point the solubility of the two\r\nforms becomes identical.[128]\r\n\r\nIf, then, the two solid phases are brought into contact with a solvent, the\r\nless stable phase will dissolve more abundantly than the more stable; the\r\nsolution will therefore become supersaturated with respect to the latter,\r\nwhich will be deposited. A gradual change of the less stable form,\r\ntherefore, takes place through the medium of the solvent. In this way the\r\nmore rapid conversion of white tin into grey in presence of a solution of\r\ntin ammonium chloride (p. 42) is to be explained. Although, as a rule,\r\nsolvents accelerate the transformation of one solid phase into the other,\r\nthey may also have a retarding influence on the velocity of transformation,\r\nas was found by Reinders in the case of mercuric iodide.[129]\r\n\r\nThe velocity of inversion, also, is variously affected by different\r\nsolvents, and in some cases, at least, it appears to be slower the more\r\nviscous the solvent;[130] indeed, Kastle and Reed state that yellow\r\ncrystals of mercuric iodide, which, ordinarily, change with considerable\r\nvelocity into the red modification, have been preserved for more than a\r\nyear under vaseline.\r\n\r\nTemperature, also, has a very considerable influence on the velocity of\r\ntransformation. The higher the temperature, and the farther it is removed\r\nfrom the equilibrium point (transition point), the greater is the velocity\r\nof change. Above the transition point, these two factors act in the same\r\ndirection, and the velocity of transformation will therefore go on\r\nincreasing indefinitely the higher the temperature is raised. Below the\r\ntransition point, however, the two factors act in opposite directions, and\r\nthe more the temperature is lowered, the more is the effect of removal from\r\nthe equilibrium point counteracted. A point will therefore be reached at\r\nwhich the velocity is a maximum. Reduction of the temperature {72} below\r\nthis point causes a rapid falling off in the velocity of change. The point\r\nof maximum velocity, however, is not definite, but may be altered by\r\nvarious causes. Thus, Cohen found that in the case of tin, the point of\r\nmaximum velocity was altered if the metal had already undergone\r\ntransformation; and also by the presence of different liquids.[131]\r\n\r\nLastly, the presence of small quantities of different substances--catalytic\r\nagents or catalyzers--has a great influence on the velocity of\r\ntransformation. Thus, _e.g._, the conversion of white to red phosphorus is\r\naccelerated by the presence of iodine (p. 47).\r\n\r\nGreater attention, however, has been paid to the study of the velocity of\r\ncrystallization of a supercooled liquid, the first experiments in this\r\ndirection having been made by Gernez[132] on the velocity of\r\ncrystallization of phosphorus and sulphur. Since that time, the velocity of\r\ncrystallization of other supercooled liquids has been investigated; such as\r\nacetic acid and phenol by Moore;[133] supercooled water by Tumlirz;[134]\r\nand a number of organic substances by Tammann,[135] Friedlaender and\r\nTammann,[136] and by Bogojawlenski.[137]\r\n\r\nIn measuring the velocity of crystallization, the supercooled liquids were\r\ncontained in narrow glass tubes, and the time required for the\r\ncrystallization to advance along a certain length of the tube was\r\ndetermined, the velocity being expressed in millimetres per minute. The\r\nresults which have so far been obtained may be summarized as follows. For\r\nany given degree of supercooling of a substance, the velocity of\r\ncrystallization is constant. As the degree of supercooling increases, the\r\nvelocity of crystallization also increases, until a certain point is\r\nreached at which the velocity is a maximum, which has a definite\r\ncharacteristic value for each substance. This maximum velocity remains\r\nconstant over a certain range of {73} temperature; thereafter, the velocity\r\ndiminishes fairly rapidly, and, with sufficient supercooling, may become\r\nzero. The liquid then passes into a glassy mass, which will remain\r\n(practically) permanent even in contact with the crystalline solid.\r\n\r\nIn ordinary glass we have a familiar example of a liquid which has been\r\ncooled to a temperature at which crystallization takes place with very\r\ngreat slowness. If, however, glass is heated, a temperature is reached,\r\nmuch below the melting point of the glass, at which crystallization occurs\r\nwith appreciable velocity, and we observe the phenomenon of\r\ndevitrification.[138]\r\n\r\nWhen the velocity of crystallization is studied at temperatures above the\r\nmaximum point, it is found that the velocity is diminished by the addition\r\nof foreign substances; and in many cases, indeed, it has been found that\r\nthe diminution is the same for equimolecular quantities of different\r\nsubstances. It would hence appear possible to utilize this behaviour as a\r\nmethod for determining molecular weights.[139] The rule is, however, by no\r\nmeans a universal one. Thus it has been found by F. Dreyer,[140] in\r\nstudying the velocity of crystallization of formanilide, that the\r\ndiminution in the velocity produced by equivalent amounts of different\r\nsubstances is not the same, but that the foreign substances exercise a\r\nspecific influence. Further, von Pickardt's rule does not hold when the\r\nforeign substance forms mixed crystals (Chap. X.) with the crystallizing\r\nsubstance.[141]\r\n\r\nLaw of Successive Reactions.--When sulphur vapour is cooled at the ordinary\r\ntemperature, it first of all condenses to drops of liquid, which solidify\r\nin an amorphous form, and only after some time undergo crystallization; or,\r\nwhen phosphorus vapour is condensed, white phosphorus is first formed, and\r\nnot the more stable form--red phosphorus. It has also been observed that\r\neven at the ordinary temperature (therefore much below the transition\r\npoint) sulphur may crystallize out from solution in benzene, alcohol,\r\ncarbon disulphide, and other {74} solvents, in the prismatic form, the less\r\nstable prismatic crystals then undergoing transformation into the rhombic\r\nform;[142] a similar behaviour has also been observed in the transformation\r\nof the monotropic crystalline forms of sulphur.[143]\r\n\r\nMany other examples might be given. In organic chemistry, for instance, it\r\nis often found that when a substance is thrown out of solution, it is first\r\ndeposited as a liquid, which passes later into the more stable crystalline\r\nform. In analysis, also, rapid precipitation from concentrated solution\r\noften causes the separation of a less stable and more soluble amorphous\r\nform.\r\n\r\nOn account of the great frequency with which the prior formation of the\r\nless stable form occurs, Ostwald[144] has put forward the _law of\r\nsuccessive reactions_, which states that when a system passes from a less\r\nstable condition it does not pass directly into the most stable of the\r\npossible states; but into the next more stable, and so step by step into\r\nthe most stable. This law explains the formation of the metastable forms of\r\nmonotropic substances, which would otherwise not be obtainable. Although it\r\nis not always possible to observe the formation of the least stable form,\r\nit should be remembered that that may quite conceivably be due to the great\r\nvelocity of transformation of the less stable into the more stable form.\r\nFrom what we have learned about the velocity of transformation of\r\nmetastable phases, we can understand that rapid cooling to a low\r\ntemperature will tend to preserve the less stable form; and, on account of\r\nthe influence of temperature in increasing the velocity of change, it can\r\nbe seen that the formation of the less stable form will be more difficult\r\nto observe in superheated than in supercooled systems. The factors,\r\nhowever, which affect the readiness with which {75} the less stable\r\nmodification is produced, appear to be rather various.[145]\r\n\r\nAlthough a number of at least apparent exceptions to Ostwald's law have\r\nbeen found, it may nevertheless be accepted as a very useful generalization\r\nwhich sums up very frequently observed phenomena.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{76}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nSYSTEMS OF TWO COMPONENTS--PHENOMENA OF DISSOCIATION\r\n\r\nIn the preceding pages we have studied the behaviour of systems consisting\r\nof only one component, or systems in which all the phases, whether solid,\r\nliquid, or vapour, had the same chemical composition (p. 13). In some\r\ncases, as, for example, in the case of phosphorus and sulphur, the\r\ncomponent was an elementary substance; in other cases, however, _e.g._\r\nwater, the component was a compound. The systems which we now proceed to\r\nstudy are characterized by the fact that the different phases have no\r\nlonger all the same chemical composition, and cannot, therefore, according\r\nto definition, be considered as one-component systems.\r\n\r\nIn most cases, little or no difficulty will be experienced in deciding as\r\nto the _number_ of the components, if the rules given on pp. 12 and 13 are\r\nborne in mind. If the composition of all the phases, each regarded as a\r\nwhole, is the same, the system is to be regarded as of the first order, or\r\na one-component system; if the composition of the different phases varies,\r\nthe system must contain more than one component. If, in order to _express_\r\nthe composition of all the phases present when the system is in\r\nequilibrium, two of the constituents participating in the equilibrium are\r\nnecessary and sufficient, the system is one of two components. Which two of\r\nthe possible substances are to be regarded as components will, however, be\r\nto a certain extent a matter of arbitrary choice.\r\n\r\nThe principles affecting the choice of components will best be learned by a\r\nstudy of the examples to be discussed in the sequel. {77}\r\n\r\nDifferent Systems of Two Components.--Applying the Phase Rule\r\n\r\n  P + F = C + 2\r\n\r\nto systems of two components, we see that in order that the system may be\r\ninvariant, there must be four phases in equilibrium together; two\r\ncomponents in three phases constitute a univariant, two components in two\r\nphases a bivariant system. In the case of systems of one component, the\r\nhighest degree of variability found was two (one component in one phase);\r\nbut, as is evident from the formula, there is a higher degree of freedom\r\npossible in the case of two-component systems. Two components existing in\r\nonly one phase constitute a tervariant system, or a system with three\r\ndegrees of freedom. In addition to the pressure and temperature, therefore,\r\na third variable factor must be chosen, and as such there is taken the\r\n_concentration of the components_. In systems of two components, therefore,\r\nnot only may there be change of pressure and temperature, as in the case of\r\none-component systems, but the concentration of the components in the\r\ndifferent phases may also alter; a variation which did not require to be\r\nconsidered in the case of one-component systems.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18.]\r\n\r\nSince a two-component system may undergo three possible {78} independent\r\nvariations, we should require for the graphic representation of all the\r\npossible conditions of equilibrium a system of three co-ordinates in space,\r\nthree axes being chosen, say, at right angles to one another, and\r\nrepresenting the three variables--pressure, temperature, and concentration\r\nof components (Fig. 18). A curve (_e.g._ AB) in the plane containing the\r\npressure and temperature axes would then represent the change of pressure\r\nwith the temperature, the concentration remaining unaltered (_pt_-diagram);\r\none in the plane containing the pressure and concentration axes (_e.g._ AF\r\nor DF), the change of pressure with the concentration, the temperature\r\nremaining constant (_pc_-diagram), while in the plane containing the\r\nconcentration and the temperature axes, the simultaneous change of these\r\ntwo factors at constant pressure would be represented (_tc_-diagram). If\r\nthe points on these three curves are joined together, a surface, ABDE, will\r\nbe formed, and any line on that surface (_e.g._ FG, or GH, or GI) would\r\nrepresent the simultaneous variation of the three factors--pressure,\r\ntemperature, concentration. Although we shall at a later point make some\r\nuse of these solid figures, we shall for the present employ the more\r\nreadily intelligible plane diagram.\r\n\r\nThe number of different systems which can be formed from two components, as\r\nwell as the number of the different phenomena which can there be observed,\r\nis much greater than in the case of one component. In the case of no two\r\nsubstances, however, have all the possible relationships been studied; so\r\nthat for the purpose of gaining an insight into the very varied behaviour\r\nof two-component systems, a number of different examples will be discussed,\r\neach of which will serve to give a picture of some of the relationships.\r\n\r\nAlthough the strict classification of the different systems according to\r\nthe Phase Rule would be based on the variability of the systems, the study\r\nof the many different phenomena, and the correlation of the comparatively\r\nlarge number of different systems, will probably be rendered easiest by\r\ngrouping these different phenomena into classes, each of these classes\r\nbeing studied with the help of one or more typical examples. The order of\r\ntreatment adopted here is, of course, quite arbitrary; {79} but has been\r\nselected from considerations of simplicity and clearness.\r\n\r\nPHENOMENA OF DISSOCIATION.\r\n\r\nBivariant Systems.--As the first examples of the equilibria between a\r\nsubstance and its products of dissociation, we shall consider very briefly\r\nthose cases in which there is one solid phase in equilibrium with vapour.\r\nReference has already been made to such systems in the case of ammonium\r\nchloride. On being heated, ammonium chloride dissociates into ammonia and\r\nhydrogen chloride. Since, however, in that case the vapour phase has the\r\nsame total composition as the solid phase, viz. NH_{3} + HCl = NH_{4}Cl,\r\nthe system consists of only one component existing in two phases; it is\r\ntherefore univariant, and to each temperature there will correspond a\r\ndefinite vapour pressure (dissociation pressure).[146]\r\n\r\nIf, however, excess of one of the products of dissociation be added, the\r\nsystem becomes one of two components.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, analysis of each of the two phases yields as the\r\ncomposition of each, solid: NH_{4}Cl (= NH_{3} + HCl); vapour: _m_NH_{3} +\r\n_n_HCl. Obviously the smallest number of substances by which the\r\ncomposition of the two phases can be expressed is two; that is, the number\r\nof components is two. What, then, are the components? The choice lies\r\nbetween NH_{3} + HCl, NH_{4}Cl + NH_{3}, and NH_{4}Cl + HCl; for the three\r\nsubstances, ammonium chloride, ammonia, hydrogen chloride, are the only\r\nones taking part in the equilibrium of the system.\r\n\r\nOf these three pairs of components, we should obviously choose as the most\r\nsimple NH_{3} and HCl, for we can then represent the composition of the two\r\nphases as the _sum_ of the two components. If one of the other two possible\r\npairs of components be chosen, we should have to introduce negative\r\nquantities of one of the components, in order to represent the composition\r\nof the vapour phase. Although it must be allowed that the introduction of\r\nnegative quantities of a component in such cases is quite permissible,\r\nstill it will be {80} better to adopt the simpler and more direct choice,\r\nwhereby the composition of each of the phases is represented as a sum of\r\ntwo components in varying proportions (p. 12).\r\n\r\nIf, therefore, we have a solid substance, such as ammonium chloride, which\r\ndissociates on volatilization, and if the products of dissociation are\r\nadded in varying amounts to the system, we shall have, in the sense of the\r\nPhase Rule, a _two-component system existing in two phases_. Such a system\r\nwill possess two degrees of freedom. At any given temperature, not only the\r\npressure, but also the composition, of the vapour-phase, _i.e._ the\r\nconcentration of the components, can vary. Only after one of these\r\nindependent variables, pressure or composition, has been arbitrarily fixed\r\ndoes the system become univariant, and exhibit a definite, constant\r\npressure at a given temperature.\r\n\r\nNow, although the Phase Rule informs us that at a given temperature change\r\nof composition of the vapour phase will be accompanied by change of\r\npressure, it does not cast any light on the relation between these two\r\nvariables. This relationship, however, can be calculated theoretically by\r\nmeans of the Law of Mass Action.[147] From this we learn that in the case\r\nof a substance which dissociates into equivalent quantities of two gases,\r\nthe product of the partial pressures of the gases is constant at a given\r\ntemperature.\r\n\r\nThis has been proved experimentally in the case of ammonium hydrosulphide,\r\nammonium cyanide, phosphonium bromide, and other substances.[148]\r\n\r\nUnivariant Systems.--In order that a system of two components shall possess\r\nonly one degree of freedom, three phases must be present. Of such systems,\r\nthere are seven possible, viz. S-S-S, S-S-L, S-S-V, L-L-L, S-L-L, L-L-V,\r\nS-L-V; S denoting solid, L liquid, and V vapour. In the present chapter we\r\nshall consider only the systems S-S-V, _i.e._ those systems in which there\r\nare two solid phases and a vapour phase present.\r\n\r\n{81}\r\n\r\nAs an example of this, we may first consider the well-known case of the\r\ndissociation of calcium carbonate. This substance on being heated\r\ndissociates into calcium oxide, or quick-lime, and carbon dioxide, as shown\r\nby the equation CaCO_{3} <--> CaO + CO_{2}. In accordance with our\r\ndefinition (p. 9), we have here two solid phases, the carbonate and the\r\nquick-lime, and one vapour phase; the system is therefore univariant. To\r\neach temperature, therefore, there will correspond a certain, definite\r\nmaximum pressure of carbon dioxide (dissociation pressure), and this will\r\nfollow the same law as the vapour pressure of a pure liquid (p. 21). More\r\nparticularly, it will be independent of the relative or absolute amounts of\r\nthe two solid phases, and of the volume of the vapour phase. If the\r\ntemperature is maintained constant, increase of volume will cause the\r\ndissociation of a further amount of the carbonate until the pressure again\r\nreaches its maximum value corresponding to the given temperature.\r\nDiminution of volume, on the other hand, will bring about the combination\r\nof a certain quantity of the carbon dioxide with the calcium oxide until\r\nthe pressure again reaches its original value.\r\n\r\nThe dissociation pressure of calcium carbonate was first studied by\r\nDebray,[149] but more exact measurements have been made by Le\r\nChatelier,[150] who found the following corresponding values of temperature\r\nand pressure:--\r\n\r\n  -------------+-------------------------\r\n               |\r\n  Temperature. | Pressure in cm. mercury.\r\n  -------------+-------------------------\r\n               |\r\n     547deg    |             2.7\r\n     610deg    |             4.6\r\n     625deg    |             5.6\r\n     740deg    |            25.5\r\n     745deg    |            28.9\r\n     810deg    |            67.8\r\n     812deg    |            76.3\r\n     865deg    |           133.3\r\n  -------------+-------------------------\r\n\r\nFrom this table we see that it is only at a temperature of about 812deg\r\nthat the pressure of the carbon dioxide becomes equal to atmospheric\r\npressure. In a vessel open to {82} the air, therefore, the complete\r\ndecomposition of the calcium carbonate would not take place below this\r\ntemperature by the mere heating of the carbonate. If, however, the carbon\r\ndioxide is removed as quickly as it is formed, say by a current of air,\r\nthen the entire decomposition can be made to take place at a much lower\r\ntemperature. For the dissociation equilibrium of the carbonate depends only\r\non the partial pressure of the carbon dioxide, and if this is kept small,\r\nthen the decomposition can proceed, even at a temperature below that at\r\nwhich the pressure of the carbon dioxide is less than atmospheric pressure.\r\n\r\nAmmonia Compounds of Metal Chlorides.--Ammonia possesses the property of\r\ncombining with various substances, chiefly the halides of metals, to form\r\ncompounds which again yield up the ammonia on being heated. Thus, for\r\nexample, on passing ammonia over silver chloride, absorption of the gas\r\ntakes place with formation of the substances AgCl,3NH_{3} and\r\n2AgCl,3NH_{3}, according to the conditions of the experiment. These were\r\nthe first known substances belonging to this class, and were employed by\r\nFaraday in his experiments on the liquefaction of ammonia. Similar\r\ncompounds have also been obtained by the action of ammonia on silver\r\nbromide, iodide, cyanide, and nitrate; and with the halogen compounds of\r\ncalcium, zinc, and magnesium, as well as with other salts. The behaviour of\r\nthe ammonia compounds of silver chloride is typical for the compounds of\r\nthis class, and may be briefly considered here.\r\n\r\nIt was found by Isambert[151] that at temperatures below 15deg, silver\r\nchloride combined with ammonia to form the compound AgCl,3NH_{3}, while at\r\ntemperatures above 20deg the compound 2AgCl,3NH_{3} was produced. On\r\nheating these substances, ammonia was evolved, and the pressure of this gas\r\nwas found in the case of both compounds to be constant at a given\r\ntemperature, but was greater in the case of the former than in the case of\r\nthe latter substance; the pressure, further, was independent of the amount\r\ndecomposed. The behaviour of these two substances is, therefore, exactly\r\nanalogous to that shown by calcium carbonate, and the explanation is also\r\nsimilar.\r\n\r\n{83}\r\n\r\nRegarded from the point of view of the Phase Rule, we see that we are here\r\ndealing with two components, AgCl and NH_{3}. On being heated, the\r\ncompounds decompose according to the equations:--\r\n\r\n  2(AgCl,3NH_{3}) <--> 2AgCl,3NH_{3} + 3NH_{3}.\r\n    2AgCl,3NH_{3} <--> 2AgCl + 3NH_{3}.\r\n\r\nThere are, therefore, three phases, viz. AgCl,3NH_{3}; 2AgCl,3NH_{3}, and\r\nNH_{3}, in the one case; and 2AgCl,3NH_{3}; AgCl, and NH_{3} in the other.\r\nThese two systems are therefore univariant, and to each temperature there\r\nmust correspond a definite pressure of dissociation, quite irrespective of\r\nthe amounts of the phases present. Similarly, if, at constant temperature,\r\nthe volume is increased (or if the ammonia which is evolved is pumped off),\r\nthe pressure will remain constant so long as two solid phases, AgCl,3NH_{3}\r\nand 2AgCl,3NH_{3}, are present, _i.e._ until the compound richer in ammonia\r\nis completely decomposed, when there will be a sudden fall in the pressure\r\nto the value corresponding to the system 2AgCl,3NH_{3}--AgCl--NH_{3}. The\r\npressure will again remain constant at constant temperature, until all the\r\nammonia has been pumped off, when there will again be a sudden fall in the\r\npressure to that of the system formed by solid silver chloride in contact\r\nwith its vapour.\r\n\r\nThe reverse changes take place when the pressure of the ammonia is\r\ngradually increased. If the volume is continuously diminished, the pressure\r\nwill first increase until it has reached a certain value; the compound\r\n2AgCl,3NH_{3} can then be formed, and the pressure will now remain constant\r\nuntil all the silver chloride has disappeared. The pressure will again\r\nrise, until it has reached the value at which the compound AgCl,3NH_{3} can\r\nbe formed, when it will again remain constant until the complete\r\ndisappearance of the lower compound. _There is no gradual change of\r\npressure_ on passing from one system to another; but the changes are\r\nabrupt, as is demanded by the Phase Rule, and as experiment has\r\nconclusively proved.[152]\r\n\r\nThe dissociation pressures of the two compounds of silver {84} chloride and\r\nammonia, as determined by Isambert,[153] are given in the following\r\ntable:--\r\n\r\n  -------------------------+-------------------------\r\n                           |\r\n          AgCl,3NH_{3}.    |        2AgCl,3NH_{3}.\r\n  -------------+-----------+--------------+----------\r\n               |           |              |\r\n  Temperature. | Pressure. | Temperature. | Pressure.\r\n  -------------+-----------+--------------+----------\r\n               |           |              |\r\n        0deg   |  29.3 cm. |    20.0deg   |   9.3 cm.\r\n     10.6deg   |  50.5 \"   |    31.0deg   |  12.5 \"\r\n     17.5deg   |  65.5 \"   |    47.0deg   |  26.8 \"\r\n     24.0deg   |  93.7 \"   |    58.5deg   |  52.8 \"\r\n     28.0deg   | 135.5 \"   |    69.0deg   |  78.6 \"\r\n     34.2deg   | 171.3 \"   |    71.5deg   |  94.6 \"\r\n     48.5deg   | 241.4 \"   |    77.5deg   | 119.8 \"\r\n     51.5deg   | 413.2 \"   |    83.5deg   | 159.3 \"\r\n     54.0deg   | 464.1 \"   |    86.1deg   | 181.3 \"\r\n               |           |    88.5deg   | 201.3 \"\r\n  -------------+-----------+--------------+----------\r\n\r\nThe conditions for the formation of these two compounds, by passing ammonia\r\nover silver chloride, to which reference has already been made, will be\r\nreadily understood from the above tables. In the case of the triammonia\r\nmono-chloride, the dissociation pressure becomes equal to atmospheric\r\npressure at a temperature of about 20deg; above this temperature,\r\ntherefore, it cannot be formed by the action of ammonia at atmospheric\r\npressure on silver chloride. The triammonia dichloride can, however, be\r\nformed, for its dissociation pressure at this temperature amounts to only 9\r\ncm., and becomes equal to the atmospheric pressure only at a temperature of\r\nabout 68deg; and this temperature, therefore, constitutes the limit above\r\nwhich no combination can take place between silver chloride and ammonia\r\nunder atmospheric pressure.\r\n\r\nAttention may be here drawn to the fact, to which reference will also be\r\nmade later, that _two_ solid phases are necessary in order that the\r\ndissociation pressure at a given temperature shall be definite; _and for\r\nthe exact definition of this pressure it is necessary to know, not merely\r\nwhat is the substance undergoing dissociation, but also what is the solid\r\nproduct of dissociation formed_. For the definition of the equilibrium, the\r\nlatter is as important as the former. We shall presently find proof of this\r\nin the case {85} of an analogous class of phenomena, viz. the dissociation\r\nof salt hydrates.\r\n\r\nSalts with Water of Crystallization.--In the case of the dehydration of\r\ncrystalline salts containing water of crystallization, we meet with\r\nphenomena which are in all respects similar to those just studied. A salt\r\nhydrate on being heated dissociates into a lower hydrate (or anhydrous\r\nsalt) and water vapour. Since we are dealing with two components--salt and\r\nwater[154]--in three phases, viz. hydrate _a_, hydrate _b_ (or anhydrous\r\nsalt), and vapour, the system is univariant, and to each temperature there\r\nwill correspond a certain, definite vapour pressure (the dissociation\r\npressure), which will be independent of the relative or absolute amounts of\r\nthe phases, _i.e._ of the amount of hydrate which has already undergone\r\ndissociation or dehydration.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19.]\r\n\r\nThe constancy of the dissociation pressure had been proved experimentally\r\nby several investigators[155] a number of years before the theoretical\r\nbasis for its necessity had been given. In the case of salts capable of\r\nforming more than one hydrate, we should obtain a series of dissociation\r\ncurves (_pt_-curves), as in the case of the different hydrates of copper\r\nsulphate. In Fig. 19 there are represented diagrammatically the\r\nvapour-pressure curves of the following univariant systems of copper\r\nsulphate and water:--\r\n\r\n  Curve OA: CuSO_{4},5H_{2}O <--> CuSO_{4},3H_{2}O + 2H_{2}O.\r\n  Curve OB: CuSO_{4},3H_{2}O <--> CuSO_{4},H_{2}O + 2H_{2}O.\r\n  Curve OC: CuSO_{4},H_{2}O   <--> CuSO_{4} + H_{2}O.\r\n\r\nLet us now follow the changes which take place on {86} increasing the\r\npressure of the aqueous vapour in contact with anhydrous copper sulphate,\r\nthe temperature being meanwhile maintained constant. If, starting from the\r\npoint D, we slowly add water vapour to the system, the pressure will\r\ngradually rise, without formation of hydrate taking place; for at pressures\r\nbelow the curve OC only the anhydrous salt can exist. At E, however, the\r\nhydrate CuSO_{4},H_{2}O will be formed, and as there are now three phases\r\npresent, viz. CuSO_{4}, CuSO_{4},H_{2}O, and vapour, the system becomes\r\n_univariant_; and since the temperature is constant, the pressure must also\r\nbe constant. Continued addition of vapour will result merely in an increase\r\nin the amount of the hydrate, and a decrease in the amount of the anhydrous\r\nsalt. When the latter has entirely disappeared, _i.e._ has passed into\r\nhydrated salt, the system again becomes _bivariant_, and passes along the\r\nline EF; the pressure gradually increases, therefore, until at F the\r\nhydrate 3H_{2}O is formed, and the system again becomes univariant; the\r\nthree phases present are CuSO_{4},H_{2}O, CuSO_{4},3H_{2}O, vapour. The\r\npressure will remain constant, therefore, until the hydrate 1H_{2}O has\r\ndisappeared, when it will again increase till G is reached; here the\r\nhydrate 5H_{2}O is formed, and the pressure once more remains constant\r\nuntil the complete disappearance of the hydrate 3H_{2}O has taken place.\r\n\r\nConversely, on dehydrating CuSO_{4},5H_{2}O at constant temperature, we\r\nshould find that the pressure would maintain the value corresponding to the\r\ndissociation pressure of the system\r\nCuSO_{4},5H_{2}O--CuSO_{4},3H_{2}O--vapour, until all the hydrate 5H_{2}O\r\nhad disappeared; further removal of water would then cause the pressure to\r\nfall _abruptly_ to the pressure of the system\r\nCuSO_{4},3H_{2}O--CuSO_{4},H_{2}O--vapour, at which value it would again\r\nremain constant until the tri-hydrate had passed into the monohydrate, when\r\na further sudden diminution of the pressure would occur. This behaviour is\r\nrepresented diagrammatically in Fig. 20, the values of the pressure being\r\nthose at 50deg.\r\n\r\nEfflorescence.--From Fig. 19 we are enabled to predict the conditions under\r\nwhich a given hydrated salt will effloresce when exposed to the air. We\r\nhave just learned that copper {87} sulphate pentahydrate, for example, will\r\nnot be formed unless the pressure of the aqueous vapour reaches a certain\r\nvalue; and that conversely, if the vapour pressure falls below the\r\ndissociation pressure of the pentahydrate, this salt will undergo\r\ndehydration. From this, then, it is evident that a crystalline salt hydrate\r\nwill effloresce when exposed to the air, if the partial pressure of the\r\nwater vapour in the air is lower than the dissociation pressure of the\r\nhydrate. At the ordinary temperature the dissociation pressure of copper\r\nsulphate is less than the pressure of water vapour in the air, and\r\ntherefore copper sulphate does not effloresce. In the case of sodium\r\nsulphate decahydrate, however, the dissociation pressure is greater than\r\nthe normal vapour pressure in a room, and this salt therefore effloresces.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20.]\r\n\r\nIndefiniteness of the Vapour Pressure of a Hydrate.--Reference has already\r\nbeen made (p. 84), in the case of the ammonia compounds of the metal\r\nchlorides, to the importance of the solid product of dissociation for the\r\ndefinition of the dissociation pressure. Similarly also in the case of a\r\nhydrated salt. A salt hydrate in contact with vapour constitutes only a\r\nbivariant system, and can exist therefore at different values of\r\ntemperature and pressure of vapour, as is seen from the diagram, Fig. 19.\r\nAnhydrous copper sulphate can exist in contact with water vapour at all\r\nvalues of temperature and pressure lying in the field below the curve OC;\r\nand the hydrate CuSO_{4},H_{2}O can exist in contact with vapour at all\r\nvalues of temperature and pressure in the field BOC. Similarly, each of the\r\nother hydrates can exist in contact with vapour at different values of\r\ntemperature and pressure.\r\n\r\nFrom the Phase Rule, however, we learn that, in order that at a given\r\ntemperature the pressure of a two-component system {88} may be constant,\r\nthere must be three phases present. Strictly, therefore, we can speak only\r\nof the vapour pressure of a _system_; and since, in the cases under\r\ndiscussion, the hydrates dissociate into a solid and a vapour, any\r\nstatement as to the vapour pressure of a hydrate has a definite meaning\r\n_only when the second solid phase produced by the dissociation is given_.\r\nThe everyday custom of speaking of the vapour pressure of a hydrated salt\r\nacquires a meaning only through the assumption, tacitly made, that the\r\nsecond solid phase, or the solid produced by the dehydration of the\r\nhydrate, is the _next lower_ hydrate, where more hydrates than one exist.\r\nThat a hydrate always dissociates in such a way that the next lower hydrate\r\nis formed is, however, by no means certain; indeed, cases have been met\r\nwith where apparently the anhydrous salt, and not the lower hydrate (the\r\nexistence of which was possible), was produced by the dissociation of the\r\nhigher hydrate.[156]\r\n\r\nThat a salt hydrate can exhibit different vapour pressures according to the\r\nsolid product of dissociation, can not only be proved theoretically, but it\r\nhas also been shown experimentally to be a fact. Thus CaCl_{2},6H_{2}O can\r\ndissociate into water vapour and either of two lower hydrates, each\r\ncontaining four molecules of water of crystallization, and designated\r\nrespectively as CaCl_{2},4H_{2}O[alpha], and CaCl_{2},4H_{2}O[beta].\r\nRoozeboom[157] has shown that the vapour pressure which is obtained differs\r\naccording to which of these two hydrates is formed, as can be seen from the\r\nfollowing figures:--\r\n\r\n  -------------+----------------------------------------------------------\r\n               |                  Pressure of System.\r\n  Temperature. +-----------------------------+----------------------------\r\n               | CaCl_{2},6H_{2}O; CaCl_{2}, | CaCl_{2},6H_{2}O; CaCl_{2},\r\n               | 4H_{2}O[alpha]; vapour.     | 4H_{2}O[beta]; vapour.\r\n  -------------+-----------------------------+----------------------------\r\n       -15deg  |         0.027 cm.           |         0.022 cm.\r\n         0     |         0.092  \"            |         0.076  \"\r\n       +10     |         0.192  \"            |         0.162  \"\r\n        20     |         0.378  \"            |         0.315  \"\r\n        25     |         0.508  \"            |         0.432  \"\r\n        29.2   |            --               |         0.567  \"\r\n        29.8   |         0.680  \"            |            --\r\n  -------------+-----------------------------+---------------------------\r\n\r\n{89}\r\n\r\nBy reason of the non-recognition of the importance of the solid\r\ndissociation product for the definition of the dissociation pressure of a\r\nsalt hydrate, many of the older determinations lose much of their value.\r\n\r\nSuspended Transformation.--Just as in systems of one component we found\r\nthat a new phase was not necessarily formed when the conditions for its\r\nexistence were established, so also we find that even when the vapour\r\npressure is lowered below the dissociation pressure of a system,\r\ndissociation does not necessarily occur. This is well known in the case of\r\nGlauber's salt, first observed by Faraday. Undamaged crystals of\r\nNa_{2}SO_{4},10H_{2}O could be kept unchanged in the open air, although the\r\nvapour pressure of the system Na_{2}SO_{4},10H_{2}O--Na_{2}SO_{4}--vapour\r\nis greater than the ordinary pressure of aqueous vapour in the air. That is\r\nto say, the possibility of the formation of the new phase Na_{2}SO_{4} was\r\ngiven; nevertheless this new phase did not appear, and the system therefore\r\nbecame metastable, or unstable with respect to the anhydrous salt. When,\r\nhowever, a trace of the new phase--the anhydrous salt--was brought in\r\ncontact with the hydrate, transformation occurred; the hydrate effloresced.\r\n\r\nThe possibility of suspended transformation or the non-formation of the new\r\nphases must also be granted in the case where the vapour pressure is raised\r\nabove that corresponding to the system hydrate--anhydrous salt (or lower\r\nhydrate)--vapour; in this case the formation of the higher hydrate becomes\r\na possibility, but not a certainty. Although there is no example of this\r\nknown in the case of hydrated salts, the suspension of the transformation\r\nhas been observed in the case of the compounds of ammonia with the metal\r\nchlorides (p. 82). Horstmann,[158] for example, found that the pressure of\r\nammonia in contact with 2AgCl,3NH_{3} could be raised to a value higher\r\nthan the dissociation pressure of AgCl,3NH_{3} without this compound being\r\nformed. We see, therefore, that even when the existence of the higher\r\ncompound in contact with the lower became possible, the higher compound was\r\nnot immediately formed.\r\n\r\nRange of Existence of Hydrates.--In Fig. 19 the vapour {90} pressure curves\r\nof the different hydrates of copper sulphate are represented as maintaining\r\ntheir relative positions throughout the whole range of temperatures. But\r\nthis is not necessarily the case. It is possible that at some temperature\r\nthe vapour pressure curve of a lower hydrate may cut that of a higher\r\nhydrate. At temperatures above the point of intersection, the lower hydrate\r\nwould have a higher vapour pressure than the higher hydrate, and would\r\ntherefore be metastable with respect to the latter. The range of stable\r\nexistence of the lower hydrate would therefore end at the point of\r\nintersection. This appears to be the case with the two hydrates of sodium\r\nsulphate, to which reference will be made later.[159]\r\n\r\nConstancy of Vapour Pressure and the Formation of Compounds.--We have seen\r\nin the case of the salt hydrates that the continued addition of the vapour\r\nphase to the system caused an increase in the pressure until at a definite\r\nvalue of the pressure a hydrate is formed; the pressure then becomes\r\nconstant, and remains so, until one of the solid phases has disappeared.\r\nConversely, on withdrawing the vapour phase, the pressure remained constant\r\nso long as any of the dissociating compound was present, independently of\r\nthe degree of the decomposition (p. 86). This behaviour, now, has been\r\nemployed for the purpose of determining whether or not definite chemical\r\ncompounds are formed. Should compounds be formed between the vapour phase\r\nand the solid, then, on continued addition or withdrawal of the vapour\r\nphase, it will be found that the vapour pressure remains constant for a\r\ncertain time, and will then suddenly assume a new value, at which it will\r\nagain remain constant. By this method, Ramsay[160] found that no definite\r\nhydrates were formed in the case of ferric and aluminium oxides, but that\r\ntwo are formed in the case of lead oxide, viz. 2PbO,H_{2}O and 3PbO,H_{2}O.\r\n\r\nThe method has also been applied to the investigation of the so-called\r\npalladium hydride,[161] and the results obtained appear to show that no\r\ncompound is formed. Reference will, however, be made to this case later\r\n(Chap. X.).\r\n\r\n{91}\r\n\r\nMeasurement of the Vapour Pressure of Hydrates.--For the purpose of\r\nmeasuring the small pressures exerted by the vapour of salt hydrates, use\r\nis very generally made of a differential manometer called the\r\n_Bremer-Frowein tensimeter_.[162]\r\n\r\nThis apparatus has the form shown in Fig. 21. It consists of a U-tube, the\r\nlimbs of which are bent close together, and placed in front of a millimetre\r\nscale. The bend of the tube is filled with oil or other suitable liquid,\r\n_e.g._ bromonaphthalene. If it is desired to measure the dissociation\r\npressure of, say, a salt hydrate, concentrated sulphuric acid is placed in\r\nthe flask _e_, and a quantity of the hydrate, well dried and powdered,[163]\r\nin the bulb d. The necks of the bulbs _d_ and _e_ are then sealed off.\r\nSince, as we have learned, suspended transformation may occur, it is\r\nadvisable to first partially dehydrate the salt, in order to ensure the\r\npresence of the second solid product of dissociation; the value of the\r\ndissociation pressure being independent of the degree of dissociation of\r\nthe hydrate (p. 86). The small bulbs _d_ and _e_ having been filled, the\r\napparatus is placed on its side, so as to allow the liquid to run from the\r\nbend of the tube into the bulbs _a_ and _b_; it is then exhausted through\r\n_f_ by means of a mercury pump, and sealed off. The apparatus is now placed\r\nin a perpendicular position in a thermostat, and kept at constant\r\ntemperature until equilibrium is established. Since the vapour pressure on\r\nthe side containing the sulphuric acid may be regarded as zero, the\r\ndifference in level of the two surfaces of liquid in the U-tube gives\r\ndirectly the dissociation pressure of the hydrate in terms of the\r\nparticular liquid employed; if the density of the latter is known, the\r\npressure can then be calculated to cm. of mercury.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 21.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{92}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nSOLUTIONS\r\n\r\nDefinition.--In all the cases which have been considered in the preceding\r\npages, the different phases--with the exception of the vapour\r\nphase--consisted of a single substance of definite composition, or were\r\ndefinite chemical individuals.[164] But this invariability of the\r\ncomposition is by no means imposed by the Phase Rule; on the contrary, we\r\nshall find in the examples which we now proceed to study, that the\r\nparticipation of phases of variable composition in the equilibrium of a\r\nsystem is in no way excluded. To such phases of variable composition there\r\nis applied the term _solution_. A solution, therefore, is to be defined as\r\n_a homogeneous mixture, the composition of which can undergo continuous\r\nvariation within certain limits_; the limits, namely, of its\r\nexistence.[165]\r\n\r\nFrom this definition we see that the term solution is not restricted to any\r\nparticular physical state of substances, but includes within its range not\r\nonly the liquid, but also the gaseous and solid states. We may therefore\r\nhave solutions of gases in liquids, and of gases in solids; of liquids in\r\nliquids or in solids; of solids in liquids, or of solids in solids.\r\nSolutions of gases in gases are, of course, also possible; since, however,\r\ngas solutions never give rise to more than one phase, their {93} treatment\r\ndoes not come within the scope of the Phase Rule, which deals with\r\nheterogeneous equilibria.\r\n\r\nIt should also be emphasized that the definition of solution given above,\r\nneither creates nor recognizes any distinction between solvent and\r\ndissolved substance (solute); and, indeed, a too persistent use of these\r\nterms and the attempt to permanently label the one or other of two\r\ncomponents as the solvent or the solute, can only obscure the true\r\nrelationships and aggravate the difficulty of their interpretation. In all\r\ncases it should be remembered that we are dealing with equilibria between\r\ntwo components (we confine our attention in the first instance to such),\r\nthe solution being constituted of these components in variable and varying\r\namounts. The change from the case where the one component is in great\r\nexcess (ordinarily called the solvent) to that in which the other component\r\npredominates, may be quite gradual, so that it is difficult or impossible\r\nto say at what point the one component ceases to be the solvent and becomes\r\nthe solute. The adoption of this standpoint need not, however, preclude one\r\nfrom employing the conventional terms solvent and solute in ordinary\r\nlanguage, especially when reference is made only to some particular\r\ncondition of equilibrium of the system, when the concentration of the two\r\ncomponents in the solution is widely different.\r\n\r\nSOLUTIONS OF GASES IN LIQUIDS.\r\n\r\nAs the first class of solutions to which we shall turn our attention, there\r\nmay be chosen the solutions of gases in liquids, or the equilibria between\r\na liquid and a gas. These equilibria really constitute a part of the\r\nequilibria to be studied more fully in Chapter VIII.; but since the\r\ntwo-phase systems formed by the solutions of gases in liquids are among the\r\nbest-known of the two-component systems, a short section may be here\r\nallotted to their treatment.\r\n\r\nWhen a gas is passed into a liquid, absorption takes place to a greater or\r\nless extent, and a point is at length reached when the liquid absorbs no\r\nmore of the gas; a condition of equilibrium is attained, and the liquid is\r\nsaid to be saturated {94} with the gas. In the light of the Phase Rule,\r\nnow, such a system is bivariant (two components in two phases); and two of\r\nthe variable factors, pressure, temperature, and concentration of the\r\ncomponents, must therefore be chosen in order that the condition of the\r\nsystem may be defined. If the concentration and the temperature are fixed,\r\nthen the pressure is also defined; or under given conditions of temperature\r\nand pressure, the concentration of the gas in the solution must have a\r\ndefinite value. If, however, the temperature alone is fixed, the\r\nconcentration and the pressure can alter; a fact so well known that it does\r\nnot require to be further insisted on.\r\n\r\nAs to the way in which the solubility of a gas in a liquid varies with the\r\npressure, the Phase Rule of course does not state; but guidance on this\r\npoint is again yielded by the theorem of van't Hoff and Le Chatelier. Since\r\nthe absorption of a gas is in all cases accompanied by a diminution of the\r\ntotal volume, this process must take place with increase of pressure. This,\r\nindeed, is stated in a quantitative manner in the law of Henry, according\r\nto which the amount of a gas absorbed is proportional to the pressure. But\r\nthis law must be modified in the case of gases which are very readily\r\nabsorbed; the _direction of change_ of concentration with the pressure\r\nwill, however, still be in accordance with the theorem of Le Chatelier.\r\n\r\nIf, on the other hand, the pressure is fixed, then the concentration will\r\nvary with the temperature; and since the absorption of gases is in all\r\ncases accompanied by the evolution of heat, the solubility is found, in\r\naccordance with the theorem of Le Chatelier, to diminish with rise of\r\ntemperature.\r\n\r\nIn considering the changes of pressure accompanying changes of\r\nconcentration and temperature, a distinction must be drawn between the\r\ntotal pressure and the partial pressure of the dissolved gas, in cases\r\nwhere the solvent is volatile. In these cases, the law of Henry applies not\r\nto the total pressure of the vapour, but only to the partial pressure of\r\nthe dissolved gas. {95}\r\n\r\nSOLUTIONS OF LIQUIDS IN LIQUIDS.\r\n\r\nWhen mercury and water are brought together, the two liquids remain side by\r\nside without mixing. Strictly speaking, mercury undoubtedly dissolves to a\r\ncertain extent in the water, and water no doubt dissolves, although to a\r\nless extent, in the mercury; the amount of substance passing into solution\r\nis, however, so minute, that it may, for all practical purposes, be left\r\nout of account, so long as the temperature does not rise much above the\r\nordinary.[166] On the other hand, if alcohol and water be brought together,\r\ncomplete miscibility takes place, and one homogeneous solution is obtained.\r\nWhether water be added in increasing quantities to pure alcohol, or pure\r\nalcohol be added in increasing amount to water, at no point, at no degree\r\nof concentration, is a system obtained containing more than one liquid\r\nphase. At the ordinary temperature, water and alcohol can form only two\r\nphases, liquid and vapour. If, however, water be added to ether, or if\r\nether be added to water, solution will not occur to an indefinite extent;\r\nbut a point will be reached when the water or the ether will no longer\r\ndissolve more of the other component, and a further addition of water on\r\nthe one hand, or ether on the other, will cause the formation of two liquid\r\nlayers, one containing excess of water, the other excess of ether. We\r\nshall, therefore, expect to find all grades of miscibility, from almost\r\nperfect immiscibility to perfect miscibility, or miscibility in all\r\nproportions. In cases of perfect immiscibility, the components do not\r\naffect one another, and the system therefore remains unchanged. Such cases\r\ndo not call for treatment here. We have to concern ourselves here only with\r\nthe second and third cases, viz. with cases of complete and of partial\r\nmiscibility. There is no essential difference between the two classes, for,\r\nas we shall see, {96} the one passes into the other with change of\r\ntemperature. The formal separation into two groups is based on the\r\nmiscibility relations at ordinary temperatures.\r\n\r\nPartial or Limited Miscibility.--In accordance with the Phase Rule, a pure\r\nliquid in contact with its vapour constitutes a univariant system. If,\r\nhowever, a small quantity of a second substance is added, which is capable\r\nof dissolving in the first, a bivariant system will be obtained; for there\r\nare now two components and, as before, only two phases--the homogeneous\r\nliquid solution and the vapour. At constant temperature, therefore, both\r\nthe composition of the solution and the pressure of the vapour can undergo\r\nchange; or, if the composition of the solution remains unchanged, the\r\npressure and the temperature can alter. If the second (liquid) component is\r\nadded in increasing amount, the liquid will at first remain homogeneous,\r\nand its composition and pressure will undergo a continuous change; when,\r\nhowever, the concentration has reached a definite value, solution no longer\r\ntakes place; two liquid phases are produced. Since there are now three\r\nphases present, two liquids and vapour, the system is univariant; at a\r\ngiven temperature, therefore, the concentration of the components in the\r\ntwo liquid phases, as well as the vapour pressure, must have definite\r\nvalues. Addition of one of the components, therefore, cannot alter the\r\nconcentrations or the pressure, but can only cause a change in the relative\r\namounts of the phases.\r\n\r\nThe two liquid phases can be regarded, the one as a solution of the\r\ncomponent I. in component II., the other as a solution of component II. in\r\ncomponent I. If the pressure is maintained constant, then to each\r\ntemperature there will correspond a definite concentration of the\r\ncomponents in the two liquid phases; and addition of excess of one will\r\nmerely alter the relative amounts of the two solutions. As the temperature\r\nchanges, the composition of the two solutions will change, and there will\r\ntherefore be obtained two solubility curves, one showing the solubility of\r\ncomponent I. in component II., the other showing the solubility of\r\ncomponent II. in component I. Since heat may be either evolved or absorbed\r\nwhen one liquid dissolves in another, the solubility may diminish or\r\nincrease {97} with rise of temperature. The two solutions which at a given\r\ntemperature correspond to one another are known as _conjugate solutions_.\r\n\r\nThe solubility relations of partially miscible liquids have been studied by\r\nGuthrie,[167] and more especially by Alexejeff[168] and by Rothmund.[169] A\r\nconsiderable variety of curves have been obtained, and we shall therefore\r\ndiscuss only a few of the different cases which may be taken as typical of\r\nthe rest.\r\n\r\nPhenol and Water.--When phenol is added to water at the ordinary\r\ntemperature, solution takes place, and a homogeneous liquid is produced.\r\nWhen, however, the concentration of the phenol in the solution has risen to\r\nabout 8 per cent., phenol ceases to be dissolved; and a further addition of\r\nit causes the formation of a second liquid phase, which consists of excess\r\nof phenol and a small quantity of water. In ordinary language it may be\r\ncalled a solution of water in phenol. If now the temperature is raised,\r\nthis second liquid phase will disappear, and a further amount of phenol\r\nmust be added in order to produce a separation of the liquid into two\r\nlayers. In this way, by increasing the amount of phenol and noting the\r\ntemperature at which the two layers disappear, the so-called solubility\r\ncurve of phenol in water can be obtained. By noting the change of the\r\nsolubility with the temperature in this manner, it is found that at all\r\ntemperatures below 68.4deg, the addition of more than a certain amount of\r\nphenol causes the formation of two layers; at temperatures above this,\r\nhowever, two layers cannot be formed, no matter how much phenol is added.\r\nAt temperatures above 68.4deg, therefore, water and phenol are miscible in\r\nall proportions.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if water is added to phenol at the ordinary temperature,\r\na liquid is produced which consists chiefly of phenol, and on increasing\r\nthe amount of water beyond a certain point, two layers are formed. On\r\nraising the temperature these two layers disappear, and a homogeneous\r\nsolution is again obtained. The phenomena are exactly analogous to those\r\nalready described. Since, now, in the second {98} case the concentration of\r\nthe phenol in the solution gradually decreases, while in the former case it\r\ngradually increases, a point must at length be reached at which the\r\ncomposition of the two solutions becomes the same. On mixing the two\r\nsolutions, therefore, one homogeneous liquid will be obtained. But the\r\npoint at which two phases become identical is called a critical point, so\r\nthat, in accordance with this definition, the temperature at which the two\r\nsolutions of phenol and water become identical may be called the _critical\r\nsolution temperature_, and the concentration at this point may be called\r\nthe _critical concentration_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 22.]\r\n\r\nFrom what has been said above, it will be seen that at any temperature\r\nbelow the critical solution temperature, two conjugate solutions containing\r\nwater and phenol in different concentration can exist together, one\r\ncontaining excess of water, the other excess of phenol. The following table\r\ngives the composition of the two layers, and the values are represented\r\ngraphically in Fig. 22.[170]\r\n\r\n  PHENOL AND WATER.\r\n\r\n  C_{1} is the percentage amount of phenol in the first layer.\r\n  C_{2}         \"          \"          \"           second layer.\r\n  -------------+--------+--------\r\n  Temperature. |  C_{1}.|  C_{2}.\r\n  -------------+--------+--------\r\n     20deg     |   8.5  |  72.2\r\n     30deg     |   8.7  |  69.9\r\n     40deg     |   9.7  |  66.8\r\n     50deg     |  12.0  |  62.7\r\n     55deg     |  14.2  |  60.0\r\n     60deg     |  17.5  |  56.2\r\n     65deg     |  22.7  |  49.7\r\n     68.4deg   |  36.1  |  36.1\r\n  -------------+--------+--------\r\n\r\n{99}\r\n\r\nThe critical solution temperature for phenol and water is 68.4deg, the\r\ncritical concentration 36.1 per cent. of phenol. At all temperatures above\r\n68.4deg, only homogeneous solutions of phenol and water can be obtained;\r\nwater and phenol are then miscible in all proportions.\r\n\r\nAt the critical solution point the system exists in only two phases--liquid\r\nand vapour. It ought, therefore, to possess two degrees of freedom. The\r\nrestriction is, however, imposed that the composition of the two liquid\r\nphases, coexisting at a point infinitely near to the critical point,\r\nbecomes the same, and this disposes of one of the degrees of freedom. The\r\nsystem is therefore univariant; and at a given temperature the pressure\r\nwill have a definite value. Conversely, if the pressure is fixed (as is the\r\ncase when the system is under the pressure of its own vapour), then the\r\ntemperature will also be fixed; that is, the critical solution temperature\r\nhas a definite value depending only on the substances. If the vapour phase\r\nis omitted, the temperature will alter with the pressure; in this case,\r\nhowever, as in the case of other condensed systems, the effect of pressure\r\nis slight.\r\n\r\nFrom Fig. 22 it is easy to predict the effect of bringing together water\r\nand phenol in any given quantities at any temperature. Start with a\r\nsolution of phenol and water having the composition represented by the\r\npoint _x_. If to this solution phenol is added at constant temperature, it\r\nwill dissolve, and the composition of the solution will gradually change,\r\nas shown by the dotted line _xy_. When, however, the concentration has\r\nreached the value represented by the point _y_, two liquid layers will be\r\nformed, the one solution having the composition represented by _y_, the\r\nother that represented by _y'_. The system is now univariant, and on\r\nfurther addition of phenol, the composition of the two liquid phases will\r\nremain unchanged, but their relative amounts will alter. The phase richer\r\nin phenol will increase in amount; that richer in water will decrease, and\r\nultimately disappear, and there will remain the solution _y'_. Continued\r\naddition of phenol will then lead to the point _x'_, there being now only\r\none liquid phase present.\r\n\r\nSince the critical solution point represents the highest temperature at\r\nwhich two liquid phases consisting of phenol and {100} water can exist\r\ntogether, these two substances can be brought together in any amount\r\nwhatever at temperatures higher than 68.4deg, without the formation of two\r\nlayers. It will therefore be possible to pass from a system represented by\r\n_x_ to one represented by _x'_, without at any time two liquid phases\r\nappearing. Starting with _x_, the temperature is first raised above the\r\ncritical solution temperature; phenol is then added until the concentration\r\nreaches the point _x__{2}. On allowing the temperature to fall, the system\r\nwill then pass into the condition represented by _x'_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 23.]\r\n\r\nMethylethylketone and Water.--In the case just described, the solubility of\r\neach component in the other increased continuously with the temperature.\r\nThere are, however, cases where a maximum or minimum of solubility is\r\nfound, _e.g._ methylethylketone and water. The curve which represents the\r\nequilibria between these two substances is given in Fig. 23, the\r\nconcentration values being contained in the following table:[171]--\r\n\r\n  METHYLETHYLKETONE AND WATER.\r\n\r\n  --------------+-----------------+-----------------\r\n  Temperature.  | C_{1} per cent. |  C_{2} per cent.\r\n  --------------+-----------------+-----------------\r\n      -10deg    |      34.5       |     89.7\r\n      +10deg    |      26.1       |     90.0\r\n       30deg    |      21.9       |     89.9\r\n       50deg    |      17.5       |     89.0\r\n       70deg    |      16.2       |     85.7\r\n       90deg    |      16.1       |     84.8\r\n      110deg    |      17.7       |     80.0\r\n      130deg    |      21.8       |     71.9\r\n      140deg    |      26.0       |     64.0\r\n      151.8deg  |      44.2       |     44.2\r\n  --------------+-----------------+-----------------\r\n\r\n{101}\r\n\r\nThese numbers and Fig. 23 show clearly the occurrence of a minimum in the\r\nsolubility of the ketone in water, and also a minimum (at about 10deg) in\r\nthe solubility of water in methylethylketone. Minima of solubility have\r\nalso been found in other cases.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 24.]\r\n\r\nTriethylamine and Water.--Although in most of the cases studied the\r\nsolubility of one liquid in another increases with rise of temperature,\r\nthis is not so in all cases. Thus, at temperatures below 18deg,\r\ntriethylamine and water mix together in all proportions; but, on raising\r\nthe temperature, the homogeneous solution becomes turbid and separates into\r\ntwo layers. In this case, therefore, the critical solution temperature is\r\nfound in the direction of lower temperature, not in the direction of\r\nhigher.[172] This behaviour is clearly shown by the graphic representation\r\nin Fig. 24, and also by the numbers in the following table:--\r\n\r\n  TRIETHYLAMINE AND WATER.\r\n\r\n  -------------+-----------------+----------------\r\n  Temperature. | C_{1} per cent. |  C_{2} per cent.\r\n  -------------+-----------------+----------------\r\n      70deg    |      1.6        |     --\r\n      50deg    |      2.9        |     --\r\n      30deg    |      5.6        |     96\r\n      25deg    |      7.3        |     95.5\r\n      20deg    |     15.5        |     73\r\n   +/-18.5deg  |  +/-30          |  +/-30\r\n  -------------+-----------------+----------------\r\n\r\nGeneral Form of Concentration-Temperature Curve.--From the preceding\r\nfigures it will be seen that the general {102} form of the solubility curve\r\nis somewhat parabolic in shape; in the case of triethylamine and water, the\r\nclosed end of the curve is very flat. Since for all liquids there is a\r\npoint (critical point) at which the liquid and gaseous states become\r\nidentical, and since all gases are miscible in all proportions, it follows\r\nthat there must be some temperature at which the liquids become perfectly\r\nmiscible. In the case of triethylamine and water, which has just been\r\nconsidered, there must therefore be an upper critical solution temperature,\r\nso that the complete solubility relations would be represented by a closed\r\ncurve of an ellipsoidal aspect. An example of such a curve is furnished by\r\nnicotine and water. At temperatures below 60deg and above 210deg, nicotine\r\nand water mix in all proportions.[173] Although it is possible that this is\r\nthe general form of the curve for all pairs of liquids, there are as yet\r\ninsufficient data to prove it.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the closed end of the curve it may be said that it is\r\ncontinuous; the critical solution point is not the intersection of two\r\ncurves, for such a break in the continuity of the curve could occur only if\r\nthere were some discontinuity in one of the phases. No such discontinuity\r\nexists. The curve is, therefore, not to be considered as two solubility\r\ncurves cutting at a point; it is a curve of equilibrium between two\r\ncomponents, and so long as the phases undergo continuous change, the curve\r\nrepresenting the equilibrium must also be continuous. As has already been\r\nemphasized, a distinction between solvent and solute is merely conventional\r\n(p. 93).\r\n\r\nPressure-Concentration Diagram.--In considering the pressure-concentration\r\ndiagram of a system of two liquid components, a distinction must be drawn\r\nbetween the total pressure of the system and the partial pressures of the\r\ncomponents. On studying the total pressure of a system, it is found that\r\ntwo cases can be obtained.[174]\r\n\r\nSo long as there is only one liquid phase, the system is bivariant. The\r\npressure therefore can change with the concentration and the temperature.\r\nIf the temperature is maintained {103} constant, the pressure will vary\r\nonly with the concentration, and this variation can therefore be\r\nrepresented by a curve. If, however, two liquid phases are formed, the\r\nsystem becomes univariant: and if one of the variables, say the\r\ntemperature, is arbitrarily fixed, the system no longer possesses any\r\ndegree of freedom. _When two liquid phases are formed, therefore, the\r\nconcentrations and the vapour pressure have definite values, which are\r\nmaintained so long as the two liquid phases are present_; the temperature\r\nbeing supposed constant.\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 25 is given a diagrammatic representation of the two kinds of\r\npressure-concentration curves which have so far been obtained. In the one\r\ncase, the vapour pressure of the invariant system (at constant temperature)\r\nlies higher than the vapour pressure of either of the pure components; a\r\nphenomenon which is very generally found in the case of partially miscible\r\nliquids, _e.g._ ether and water.[175] Accordingly, by the addition of water\r\nto ether, or of ether to water, there is an increase in the _total_ vapour\r\npressure of the system.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 25.]\r\n\r\nWith regard to the second type, the vapour pressure of the systems with two\r\nliquid phases lies between that of the two single components. An example of\r\nthis is found in sulphur dioxide and water.[176] On adding sulphur dioxide\r\nto water there is an increase of the total vapour pressure; but on adding\r\nwater to liquid sulphur dioxide, the total vapour pressure is diminished.\r\n\r\nThe case that the vapour pressure of the system with two {104} liquid\r\nphases is _less_ than that of each of the components is not possible.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the _partial pressure_ of the components, the behaviour is\r\nmore uniform. The partial pressure of one component is in all cases lowered\r\nby the addition of the other component, the diminution being approximately\r\nproportional to the amount added. If two liquid phases are present, the\r\npartial pressure of the components, as well as the total pressure, is\r\nconstant, and is the same for both phases. That is to say, in the case of\r\nthe two liquids, saturated solution of water in ether, and of ether in\r\nwater, the partial pressure of the ether in the vapour in contact with the\r\none solution is the same as that in the vapour over the other\r\nsolution.[177]\r\n\r\nComplete Miscibility.--Although the phenomena of complete miscibility are\r\nhere treated under a separate heading, it must not be thought that there is\r\nany essential difference between those cases where the liquids exhibit\r\nlimited miscibility and those in which only one homogeneous solution is\r\nformed. As has been already pointed out, the solubility relations alter\r\nwith the temperature; and liquids which at one temperature can dissolve in\r\none another only to a limited extent, are found at some other temperature\r\nto possess the property of complete miscibility. Conversely, we may expect\r\nthat liquids which at one temperature, say at the ordinary temperature, are\r\nmiscible in all proportions, will be found at some other temperature to be\r\nonly partially miscible. Thus, for example, it was found by Guthrie that\r\nethyl alcohol and carbon disulphide, which are miscible in all proportions\r\nat the ordinary temperature, possess only limited miscibility at\r\ntemperatures below -14.4deg.[178] Nevertheless, it is doubtful if the\r\ncritical solution temperature is in all cases experimentally realizable.\r\n\r\nPressure-Concentration Diagram.--Since, in the cases of complete\r\nmiscibility of two liquid components, there are never more than two phases\r\npresent, the system must always be bivariant; and two of the variables\r\npressure, temperature or concentration of the components, must be\r\narbitrarily chosen {105} before the system becomes defined. For this reason\r\nthe Phase Rule affords only a slight guidance in the study of such\r\nequilibria; and we shall therefore not enter in detail into the behaviour\r\nof these homogeneous mixtures. All that the Phase Rule can tell us in\r\nconnection with these solutions, is that at constant temperature the vapour\r\npressure of the solution varies with the composition of the liquid phase;\r\nand if the composition of the liquid phase remains unchanged, the pressure\r\nalso must remain unchanged. This constancy of composition is exhibited not\r\nonly by pure liquids, but also by liquid solutions in all cases where the\r\nvapour pressure of the solution reaches a maximum or minimum value. This is\r\nthe case, for example, with mixtures of constant boiling point.[179]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{106}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nSOLUTIONS OF SOLIDS IN LIQUIDS, ONLY ONE OF THE COMPONENTS BEING VOLATILE\r\n\r\nGeneral.--When a solid is brought into contact with a liquid in which it\r\ncan dissolve, a certain amount of it passes into solution; and the process\r\ncontinues until the concentration reaches a definite value independent of\r\nthe amount of solid present. A condition of equilibrium is established\r\nbetween the solid and the solution; the solution becomes _saturated_. Since\r\nthe number of components is two, and the number of phases three, viz.\r\nsolid, liquid solution, vapour, the system is univariant. If, therefore,\r\none of the factors, pressure, temperature, or concentration of the\r\ncomponents (in the solution[180]), is arbitrarily fixed, the state of the\r\nsystem becomes perfectly defined. Thus, at any given temperature, the\r\nvapour pressure of the system and the concentration of the components have\r\na definite value. If the temperature is altered, the vapour pressure and\r\nalso, in general, the concentration will undergo change. Likewise, if the\r\npressure varies, while the system is isolated so that no heat can pass\r\nbetween it and its surroundings, the concentration and the temperature must\r\nalso undergo variation until they attain values corresponding to the\r\nparticular pressure.\r\n\r\nThat the temperature has an influence, sometimes a very considerable\r\ninfluence, on the amount of substance passing into solution, is\r\nsufficiently well known; the effect of pressure, although less apparent, is\r\nno less certain. If at any given temperature the volume of the vapour phase\r\nis diminished, {107} vapour will condense to liquid, in order that the\r\npressure may remain constant, and so much of the solid will pass into\r\nsolution that the concentration may remain unchanged; for, so long as the\r\nthree phases are present, the state of the system cannot alter. If,\r\nhowever, one of the phases, _e.g._ the vapour phase, disappears, the system\r\nbecomes bivariant; at any given temperature, therefore, there may be\r\ndifferent values of concentration and pressure.\r\n\r\nThe direction in which change of concentration will occur with change of\r\npressure can be predicted by means of the theorem of Le Chatelier, if it is\r\nknown whether solution is accompanied by increase or diminution of the\r\ntotal volume. If diminution of the total volume of the system occurs on\r\nsolution, increase of pressure will increase the solubility; in the reverse\r\ncase, increase of pressure will diminish the solubility.\r\n\r\nThis conclusion has also been verified by experiment, as is shown by the\r\nfollowing figures.[181]\r\n\r\n  ---------------------------------------------------------------\r\n                    |Change of       |  Solubility (at 18deg) (grams salt\r\n                    |volume by       |  in 1 gram of solution).\r\n                    |dissolving 1 gm.|---------------------------\r\n       Salt.        |of salt in the  |          |\r\n                    |saturated       | Pressure | Pressure\r\n                    |solution.       | = 1 atm. | = 500 atm.\r\n  ------------------+----------------+----------+----------------\r\n  Sodium chloride   |     -0.07      |  0.264   |   0.270\r\n  Ammonium chloride |     +0.10      |  0.272   |   0.258\r\n  Alum              |     -0.067     |  0.115   |   0.142\r\n                    |                |          |(_p_ = 400 atm.)\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nAs can be seen, a large increase of the pressure brings about a no more\r\nthan appreciable alteration of the solubility; a result which is due, as in\r\nthe case of the alteration of the fusion point with the pressure, to the\r\nsmall change in volume accompanying solution or increase of pressure. For\r\nall practical purposes, therefore, the solubility as determined under\r\natmospheric pressure may be taken as equal to the true {108} solubility,\r\nthat is, the solubility when the system is under the pressure of its own\r\nvapour.\r\n\r\nThe Saturated Solution.--From what has been said above, it will be seen\r\nthat the condition of saturation of a solution can be defined only with\r\nrespect to a certain solid phase; if no solid is present, the system is\r\nundefined, for it then consists of only two phases, and is therefore\r\nbivariant. Under such circumstances not only can there be at one given\r\ntemperature solutions of different concentration, all containing less of\r\none of the components than when that component is present in the solid\r\nform, but there can also exist solutions containing more of that component\r\nthan corresponds to the equilibrium when the solid is present. In the\r\nformer case the solutions are _unsaturated_, in the latter case they are\r\n_supersaturated with respect to a certain solid phase_; in themselves, the\r\nsolutions are stable, and are neither unsaturated nor supersaturated.\r\nFurther, if the solid substance can exist in different allotropic\r\nmodifications, the particular form of the substance which is in equilibrium\r\nwith the solution must be known, in order that the statement of the\r\nsolubility may be definite; for each form has its own solubility, and, as\r\nwe shall see presently, the less stable form has the greater solubility\r\n(cf. p. 47). In all determinations of the solubility, therefore, not only\r\nmust the concentration of the components in the solution be determined, but\r\nequal importance should be attached to the characterisation of the solid\r\nphase present.\r\n\r\nIn this connection, also, one other point may be emphasised. For the\r\nproduction of the equilibrium between a solid and a liquid, time is\r\nnecessary, and this time not only varies with the state of division of the\r\nsolid and the efficiency of the stirring, but is also dependent on the\r\nnature of the substance.[182] Considerable care must therefore be taken\r\nthat sufficient time is allowed for equilibrium to be established. Such\r\ncare is more especially needful when changes may occur in the solid phase,\r\nand neglect of it has greatly diminished the value of many of the older\r\ndeterminations of solubility.\r\n\r\nForm of the Solubility Curve.--The solubility curve--that {109} is, the\r\ncurve representing the change of concentration of the components in the\r\nsolution with the temperature--differs markedly from the curve of vapour\r\npressure (p. 63), in that it possesses no general form, but may vary in the\r\nmost diverse manner. Not only may the curve have an almost straight and\r\nhorizontal course, or slope or curve upwards at varying angles; but it may\r\neven slope downwards, corresponding to a decrease in the solubility with\r\nrise of temperature; may exhibit maxima or minima of solubility, or may, as\r\nin the case of some hydrated salts, pass through a point of maximum\r\ntemperature. In the latter case the salt may possess two values of\r\nsolubility at the same temperature. We shall consider these cases in the\r\nfollowing chapter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 26.]\r\n\r\nThe great variety of form shown by solubility curves is at once apparent\r\nfrom Fig. 26, in which the solubility curves of various substances (not,\r\nhowever, drawn to scale) are reproduced.[183]\r\n\r\nVaried as is the form of the solubility curve, its _direction_,\r\nnevertheless, can be predicted by means of the theorem of van't Hoff and Le\r\nChatelier; for in accordance with that theorem (p. 57) increase of\r\nsolubility with the temperature must occur in those cases where the process\r\nof solution is accompanied by an _absorption_ of heat; and a decrease in\r\nthe solubility with rise of temperature will be found in cases where\r\nsolution occurs with _evolution_ of heat. Where there is no heat effect\r\naccompanying solution, {110} change of temperature will be without\r\ninfluence on the solubility; and if the sign of the heat of solution\r\nchanges, the direction of the solubility curve must also change, _i.e._\r\nmust show a maximum or minimum point. This has in all cases been verified\r\nby experiment.[184]\r\n\r\nIn applying the theorem of Le Chatelier to the course of the solubility\r\ncurve, it should be noted that by heat of solution there is meant, not the\r\nheat effect produced on dissolving the salt in a large amount of solvent\r\n(which is the usual signification of the expression), but the heat which is\r\nabsorbed or evolved when the salt is dissolved in the almost saturated\r\nsolution (the so-called last heat of solution). Not only does the heat\r\neffect in the two cases have a different value, but it may even have a\r\ndifferent sign. A striking example of this is afforded by cupric chloride,\r\nas the following figures show:[185]--\r\n\r\n  -----------------------------------------------------------\r\n  Number of gram-molecules of        |\r\n  CuCl_{2}, 2H_{2}O dissolved in 198 |       Heat effect.\r\n  gram-molecules of water.           |\r\n  -----------------------------------+-----------------------\r\n              1                      |          +37 K\r\n              2.02                   |          +66 \"\r\n              4.15                   |         +105 \"\r\n              7.07                   |         +117 \"\r\n              9.95                   |         +117 \"\r\n             11                      |          +91 \"\r\n             18.8                    |          -10 \"\r\n             19.6                    |          -31 \"\r\n             24.75                   |         -198 \"\r\n  ------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nIn the above table the positive sign indicates evolution of heat, the\r\nnegative sign, absorption of heat; and the values of the heat effect are\r\nexpressed in centuple calories. Judging from the heat effect produced on\r\ndissolving cupric chloride in a large bulk of water, we should predict that\r\nthe solubility of that salt would diminish with rise of temperature; as a\r\nmatter of fact, it increases. This is in accordance with the fact that\r\n{111} the last heat of solution is _negative_ (as expressed above), _i.e._\r\nsolution of the salt in the almost saturated solution is accompanied by\r\nabsorption of heat. We are led to expect this from the fact that the heat\r\nof solution changes sign from positive to negative as the concentration\r\nincreases; experiment also showed it to be the case.\r\n\r\nDespite its many forms, it should be particularly noted that the solubility\r\ncurve of any substance is _continuous_, so long as the solid phase, or\r\nsolid substance in contact with the solution, remains unchanged. If any\r\n\"break\" or discontinuous change in the direction of the curve occurs, it is\r\na sign that the _solid phase has undergone alteration_. Conversely, if it\r\nis known that a change takes place in the solid phase, a break in the\r\nsolubility curve can be predicted. We shall presently meet with examples of\r\nthis.[186]\r\n\r\nA.--ANHYDROUS SALT AND WATER.\r\n\r\nThe Solubility Curve.--In studying the equilibria in those systems of two\r\ncomponents in which the liquid phase is a solution or phase of varying\r\ncomposition, we shall in the present chapter limit the discussion to those\r\ncases where no compounds are formed, but where the components crystallise\r\nout in the pure state. Since some of the best-known examples of such\r\nsystems are yielded by the solutions of anhydrous salts in water, we shall\r\nfirst of all briefly consider some of the results which have been obtained\r\nwith them.\r\n\r\nFor the most part the solubility curves have been studied only at\r\ntemperatures lying between 0deg and 100deg, the solid phase in contact with\r\nthe solution being the anhydrous salt. For the representation of these\r\nequilibria, the concentration-temperature {112} diagram is employed, the\r\nconcentration being expressed as the number of grams of the salt dissolved\r\nin 100 grams of water, or as the number of gram-molecules of salt in 100\r\ngram-molecules of water. The curves thus obtained exhibit the different\r\nforms to which reference has already been made. So long as the salt remains\r\nunchanged the curve will be continuous, but if the salt alters its form,\r\nthen the solubility curve will show a break.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 27.]\r\n\r\nNow, we have already seen in Chapter III. that certain substances are\r\ncapable of existing in various crystalline forms, and these forms are so\r\nrelated to one another that at a given temperature the relative stability\r\nof each pair of polymorphic forms undergoes change. Since each crystalline\r\nvariety of a substance must have its own solubility, there must be a break\r\nin the solubility curve at the temperature of transition of the two\r\nenantiotropic forms. At this point the two solubility curves must cut, for\r\nsince the two forms are in equilibrium with respect to their vapour, they\r\nmust also be in equilibrium with respect to their solutions. From the table\r\non p. 63 it is seen that potassium nitrate, ammonium nitrate, silver\r\nnitrate, thallium nitrate, thallium picrate, are capable of existing in two\r\nor more different enantiotropic crystalline forms, the range of stability\r\nof these forms being limited by definite temperatures (transition\r\ntemperature). Since the transition point is not altered by a solvent\r\n(provided the latter is not absorbed by the solid phase), we should find on\r\nstudying the solubility of these substances in water that the solubility\r\ncurve would exhibit a change in direction at the temperature of transition.\r\nAs a matter of fact this has been verified, more especially in the case of\r\nammonium nitrate[187] {113} and thallium picrate.[188] The following table\r\ncontains the values of the solubility of ammonium nitrate obtained by\r\nMueller and Kaufmann, the solubility being expressed in gram-molecules\r\nNH_{4}NO_{3} in 100 gram-molecules of water. In Fig. 27 these results are\r\nrepresented graphically. The equilibrium point was approached both from the\r\nside of unsaturation and of supersaturation, and the condition of\r\nequilibrium was controlled by determinations of the density of the\r\nsolution.\r\n\r\n  SOLUBILITY OF AMMONIUM NITRATE.\r\n\r\n  ------------------------------------------------------------\r\n   Temperature. | Solubility. | Temperature. | Solubility.\r\n  --------------+-------------+--------------+----------------\r\n     12.2deg    |    34.50    |   32.7deg    |    57.90\r\n     20.2deg    |    43.30    |   34.0deg    |    58.89\r\n     25.05deg   |    48.19    |   35.0deg    |    59.80\r\n     28.0deg    |    51.86    |   36.0deg    |    61.00\r\n     30.0deg    |    54.40    |   37.5deg    |    62.90\r\n     30.2deg    |    54.61    |   38.0deg    |    63.60\r\n     31.9deg    |    57.20    |   39.0deg    |    65.09\r\n     32.1deg    |    57.60    |   40.0deg    |    66.80\r\n  ------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nFrom the graphic representation of the solubility given in Fig. 27, there\r\nis seen to be a distinct change in the direction of the curve at a\r\ntemperature of 32deg; and this break in the curve corresponds to the\r\ntransition of the [beta]-rhombic into the [alpha]-rhombic form of ammonium\r\nnitrate (p. 63).\r\n\r\nSuspended Transformation and Supersaturation.--As has already been learned,\r\nthe transformation of the one crystalline form into the other does not\r\nnecessarily take place immediately the transition point has been passed;\r\nand it has therefore been found possible in a number of cases to follow the\r\nsolubility curve of a given crystalline form beyond the point at which it\r\nceases to be the most stable modification. Now, it will be readily seen\r\nfrom Fig. 27 that if the two solubility curves be prolonged beyond the\r\npoint of intersection, the solubility of the less stable form is greater\r\nthan that of the more stable. A solution, therefore, which is saturated\r\nwith respect to the less stable form, _i.e._ which is in equilibrium with\r\nthat form, is _supersaturated with respect to the more stable\r\nmodification_. If, {114} therefore, a small quantity of the more stable\r\nform is introduced into the solution, the latter must deposit such an\r\namount of the more stable form that the concentration of the solution\r\ncorresponds to the solubility of the stable form at the particular\r\ntemperature. Since, however, the solution is now _unsaturated_ with respect\r\nto the less stable variety, the latter, if present, must pass into\r\nsolution; and the two processes, deposition of the stable and solution of\r\nthe metastable form, must go on until the latter form has entirely\r\ndisappeared and a saturated solution of the stable form is obtained. There\r\nwill thus be a conversion, through the medium of the solvent, of the less\r\nstable into the more stable modification. This behaviour is of practical\r\nimportance in the determination of transition points (_v._ Appendix).\r\n\r\nFrom the above discussion it will be seen how important is the statement of\r\nthe solid phase for the definition of saturation and supersaturation.[189]\r\n\r\nSolubility Curve at Higher Temperatures.--On passing to the consideration\r\nof the solubility curves at higher temperatures, two chief cases must be\r\ndistinguished.\r\n\r\n    (1) The two components in the fused state can mix in all proportions.\r\n\r\n    (2) The two components in the fused state cannot mix in all\r\n    proportions.\r\n\r\n1. _Complete Miscibility of the Fused Components._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 28.]\r\n\r\nThe best example of this which has been studied, so far as anhydrous salts\r\nand water are concerned, is that of silver nitrate and water. The\r\nsolubility of this salt at temperatures {115} above 100deg has been studied\r\nchiefly by Etard[190] and by Tilden and Shenstone.[191] The values obtained\r\nby Etard are given in the following table, and represented graphically in\r\nFig. 28.\r\n\r\n  SOLUBILITY OF SILVER NITRATE.\r\n\r\n  ---------------------------------------------------\r\n      Temperature.    |Parts of dry salt in 100 parts\r\n                      |   of solution.\r\n  --------------------+------------------------------\r\n         -7deg        |         46.2\r\n         -1deg        |         52.1\r\n         +5deg        |         56.3\r\n         10deg        |         61.2\r\n         20deg        |         67.8\r\n         40.5deg      |         76.8\r\n         73deg        |         84.0\r\n        135deg        |         92.8\r\n        182deg        |         96.9\r\n  ---------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nIn this figure the composition of the solution is expressed in parts of\r\nsilver nitrate in 100 parts by weight of the solution, so that 100 per\r\ncent. represents pure silver nitrate. As can be seen, the solubility\r\nincreases with the temperature. At a temperature of about 160deg there\r\nshould be a break in the curve due to change of crystalline form (p. 63).\r\nSuch a change in the direction of the solubility curve, however, does not\r\nin any way alter the essential nature of the relationships discussed here,\r\nand may for the present be left out of account. On following the solubility\r\ncurve of silver nitrate to higher temperatures, therefore, the\r\nconcentration of silver nitrate in the solution gradually increases, until\r\nat last, at a temperature of 208deg,[192] the melting point of pure silver\r\nnitrate is reached, and the concentration of the water has become zero. The\r\ncurve throughout its whole extent represents the equilibrium between silver\r\nnitrate, solution, and vapour. Conversely, starting with pure silver\r\nnitrate in contact with the fused salt, addition of water will lower the\r\nmelting point, _i.e._ will lower the temperature at which the solid salt\r\ncan exist in contact with the liquid; {116} and the depression will be all\r\nthe greater the larger the amount of water added. As the concentration of\r\nthe water in the liquid phase is increased, therefore, the system will pass\r\nback along the curve from higher to lower temperatures, and from greater to\r\nsmaller concentrations of silver nitrate in the liquid phase. The curve in\r\nFig. 28 may, therefore, be regarded either as the solubility curve of\r\nsilver nitrate in water, or as the freezing point curve for silver nitrate\r\nin contact with a solution consisting of that salt and water.\r\n\r\nAs the temperature of the saturated solution falls, silver nitrate is\r\ndeposited, and on lowering the temperature sufficiently a point will at\r\nlast be reached at which ice also begins to separate out. Since there are\r\nnow four phases co-existing, viz. silver nitrate, ice, solution, vapour,\r\nthe system is invariant, and the point is a _quadruple point_. This\r\nquadruple point, therefore, forms the lower limit of the solubility curve\r\nof silver nitrate. Below this point the solution becomes metastable.\r\n\r\nIce as Solid Phase.--Ice melts or is in equilibrium with water at a\r\ntemperature of 0deg. The melting point, will, however, be lowered by the\r\nsolution of silver nitrate in the water; and the greater the concentration\r\nof the salt in the solution the greater will be the depression of the\r\ntemperature of equilibrium. On continuing the addition of silver nitrate, a\r\npoint will at length be reached at which the salt is no longer dissolved,\r\nbut remains in the solid form along with the ice. We again obtain,\r\ntherefore, the invariant system ice--salt--solution--vapour. The\r\ntemperature at which this invariant system can exist has been found by\r\nMiddelberg[193] to be -7.3deg, the solution at this point containing 47.1\r\nper cent. of silver nitrate.\r\n\r\nThe same general behaviour will be found in the case of all other systems\r\nof two components belonging to this class; that is, in the case of systems\r\nfrom which the components crystallise out in the pure state, and in which\r\nthe fused components are miscible in all proportions. In all such cases,\r\ntherefore, the solubility curves (curves of equilibrium) can be represented\r\ndiagrammatically as in Fig. 29. In this figure OA represents the solubility\r\ncurve of the salt, and OB the freezing {117} point curve of ice. O is the\r\nquadruple point at which the invariant system exists, and may be regarded\r\nas the point of intersection of the solubility curve with the\r\nfreezing-point curve. Since this point is fixed, the condition of the\r\nsystem as regards temperature, vapour pressure, and concentration of the\r\ncomponents (or composition of the solution), is perfectly definite. From\r\nthe way, also, in which the condition is attained, it is evident that the\r\nquadruple point is the lowest temperature that can be obtained with\r\nmixtures of the two components in presence of vapour. It is known as the\r\n_cryohydric point_, or, generally, the _eutectic point_.[194]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 29.]\r\n\r\nCryohydrates.[195]--On cooling a solution of common salt in water to a\r\ntemperature of -3deg, Guthrie observed that the hydrate NaCl,2H_{2}O\r\nseparated out. This salt continued to be deposited until at a temperature\r\nof -22deg opaque crystals made their appearance, and the liquid passed into\r\nthe solid state without change of temperature. A similar behaviour was\r\nfound by Guthrie in the case of a large number of other salts, a\r\ntemperature below that of the melting point of ice being reached at which\r\non continued withdrawal of heat, the solution solidified at a constant\r\ntemperature. When the system had attained this minimum temperature, it was\r\nfound that the composition of the solid and the liquid phases was the same,\r\nand remained unchanged throughout the period of solidification. This is\r\nshown by the following figures, which give the composition of different\r\nsamples of the solid phase deposited from the solution at constant\r\ntemperature.[196]\r\n\r\n{118}\r\n\r\n  ---------------------------------\r\n  No. | Temperature of  |   NaCl.\r\n      | solidification. | Per cent.\r\n  ----|-----------------|----------\r\n   1  |-21deg to -22deg |   23.72\r\n   2  |     -22deg      |   23.66\r\n   3  |     -22deg      |   23.73\r\n   4  |     -23deg      |   23.82\r\n   5  |     -23deg      |   23.34\r\n   6  |     -23deg      |   23.35\r\n  ---------------------------------\r\n             Mean           23.6\r\n  ---------------------------------\r\n\r\nConversely, a mixture of ice and salt containing 23.6 per cent. of sodium\r\nchloride will melt at a definite and constant temperature, and exhibit,\r\ntherefore, a behaviour supposed to be characteristic of a pure chemical\r\ncompound. This, then, combined with the fact that the solid which was\r\ndeposited was crystalline, and that the same constant temperature was\r\nattained, no matter with what proportions of water and salt one started,\r\nled Guthrie to the belief that the solids which thus separated at constant\r\ntemperature were definite chemical compounds, to which he gave the general\r\nname _cryohydrate_. A large number of such cryohydrates were prepared and\r\nanalysed by Guthrie, and a few of these are given in the following table,\r\ntogether with the temperature of the cryohydric point:[197]--\r\n\r\n  CRYOHYDRATES.\r\n\r\n  ------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n         Salt.       | Cryohydric point. | Percentage of anhydrous\r\n                     |                   | salt in the cryohydrate.\r\n  ------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  Sodium bromide     |       -24deg      |          41.33\r\n  Sodium chloride    |       -22deg      |          23.60\r\n  Potassium iodide   |       -22deg      |          52.07\r\n  Sodium nitrate     |       -17.5deg    |          40.80\r\n  Ammonium sulphate  |       -17deg      |          41.70\r\n  Ammonium chloride  |       -15deg      |          19.27\r\n  Sodium iodide      |       -15deg      |          59.45\r\n  Potassium bromide  |       -13deg      |          32.15\r\n  Potassium chloride |       -11.4deg    |          20.03\r\n  Magnesium sulphate |        -5deg      |          21.86\r\n  Potassium nitrate  |        -2.6deg    |          11.20\r\n  Sodium sulphate    |        -0.7deg    |           4.55\r\n  ------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n{119}\r\n\r\nThe chemical individuality of these cryohydrates was, however, called in\r\nquestion by Pfaundler,[198] and disproved by Offer,[199] who showed that in\r\nspite of the constancy of the melting point, the cryohydrates had the\r\nproperties, not of definite chemical compounds, but of mixtures; the\r\narguments given being that the heat of solution and the specific volume are\r\nthe same for the cryohydrate as for a mixture of ice and salt of the same\r\ncomposition; and it was further shown that the cryohydrate had not a\r\ndefinite crystalline form, but separated out as an opaque mass containing\r\nthe two components in close juxtaposition. The heterogeneous nature of\r\ncryohydrates can also be shown by a microscopical examination.\r\n\r\nAt the cryohydric point, therefore, we are not dealing with a single solid\r\nphase, but with two solid phases, ice and salt; the cryohydric point,\r\ntherefore, as already stated, is a quadruple point and represents an\r\ninvariant system.\r\n\r\nAlthough on cooling a solution to the cryohydric point, separation of ice\r\nmay occur, it will not necessarily take place; the system may become\r\nmetastable. Similarly, separation of salt may not take place immediately\r\nthe cryohydric point is reached. It will, therefore, be possible to follow\r\nthe curves BO and AO beyond the quadruple point,[200] which is thereby\r\nclearly seen to be the point of intersection of the solubility curve of the\r\nsalt and the freezing-point curve of ice. At this point, also, the curves\r\nof the univariant systems ice--salt--vapour and ice--salt--solution\r\nintersect.\r\n\r\nChanges at the Quadruple Point.--Since the invariant system\r\nice--salt--solution--vapour can exist only at a definite temperature,\r\naddition or withdrawal of heat must cause the disappearance of one of the\r\nphases, whereby the system will become univariant. So long as all four\r\nphases are present the temperature, pressure, and concentration of the\r\ncomponents in the solution must remain constant. When, therefore, heat is\r\nadded to or withdrawn from the system, mutually compensatory changes will\r\ntake place within the system whereby the {120} condition of the latter is\r\npreserved. These changes can in all cases be foreseen with the help of the\r\ntheorem of van't Hoff and Le Chatelier; and, after what was said in Chap.\r\nIV., need only be briefly referred to here. In the first place, addition of\r\nheat will cause ice to melt, and the concentration of the solution will be\r\nthereby altered; salt must therefore dissolve until the original\r\nconcentration is reached, and the heat of fusion of ice will be\r\ncounteracted by the heat of solution of the salt. Changes of volume of the\r\nsolid and liquid phases must also be taken into account; an alteration in\r\nthe volume of these phases being compensated by condensation or\r\nevaporation. All four phases will therefore be involved in the change, and\r\nthe final state of the system will be dependent on the amounts of the\r\ndifferent phases present; the ultimate result of addition or withdrawal of\r\nheat or of change of pressure at the quadruple point will be one of the\r\nfour univariant systems: ice--solution--vapour; salt--solution--vapour;\r\nice--salt--vapour; ice--salt--solution. If the vapour phase disappear,\r\nthere will be left the univariant system ice--salt--solution, and the\r\ntemperature at which this system can exist will alter with the pressure.\r\nSince in this case the influence of pressure is comparatively slight, the\r\ntemperature of the quadruple point will differ only slightly from that of\r\nthe cryohydric point as determined under atmospheric pressure.\r\n\r\nFreezing Mixtures.--Not only will the composition of a univariant system\r\nundergo change when the temperature is varied, but, conversely, if the\r\n_composition_ of the system is caused to change, corresponding changes of\r\ntemperature must ensue. Thus, if ice is added to the univariant system\r\nsalt--solution--vapour, the ice must melt and the temperature fall; and if\r\nsufficient ice is added, the temperature of the cryohydric point must be at\r\nlength reached, for it is only at this temperature that the four phases\r\nice--salt--solution--vapour can coexist. Or, on the other hand, if salt is\r\nadded to the system ice--solution--vapour, the concentration of the\r\nsolution will increase, ice must melt, and the temperature must thereby\r\nfall; and this process also will go on until the cryohydric point is\r\nreached. In both cases ice melts and there is a change in the {121}\r\ncomposition of the solution; in the former case, salt will be\r\ndeposited[201] because the solubility diminishes as the temperature falls;\r\nin the latter, salt will pass into solution. This process may be\r\naccompanied either by an evolution or, more generally, by absorption of\r\nheat; in the former case the effect of the addition of ice will be\r\npartially counteracted; in the latter case it will be augmented.\r\n\r\nThese principles are made use of in the preparation of _freezing mixtures_.\r\nThe lowest temperature which can be reached by means of these (under\r\natmospheric pressure) is the cryohydric point. This temperature-minimum is,\r\nhowever, not always attained in the preparation of a freezing mixture, and\r\nthat for various reasons. The chief of these are radiation and the heat\r\nabsorbed in cooling the solution produced. The lower the temperature falls,\r\nthe more rapid does the radiation become; and the rate at which the\r\ntemperature sinks decreases as the amount of solution increases. Both these\r\nfactors counteract the effect of the latent heat of fusion and the heat of\r\nsolution, so that a point is reached (which may lie considerably above the\r\ncryohydric point) at which the two opposing influences balance. The\r\nabsorption of heat by the solution can be diminished by allowing the\r\nsolution to drain off as fast as it is produced; and the effect of\r\nradiation can be partially annulled by increasing the rate of cooling. This\r\ncan be done by the more intimate mixing of the components. Since, under\r\natmospheric pressure, the temperature of the cryohydric point is constant,\r\nthe cryohydrates are very valuable for the production of baths of constant\r\nlow temperature.\r\n\r\n2. _Partial Miscibility of the Fused Components._\r\n\r\nOn passing to the study of the second class of systems of two components\r\nbelonging to this group, namely, those in which the fused components are\r\nnot miscible in all proportions, we find that the relationships are not\r\nquite so simple as {122} in the case of silver nitrate and water. In the\r\nlatter case, only one liquid phase was possible; in the cases now to be\r\nstudied, two liquid phases can be formed, and there is a marked\r\ndiscontinuity in the solubility curve on passing from the cryohydric point\r\nto the melting point of the second (non-volatile) component.\r\n\r\nParatoluidine dissolves in water, and the solubility increases as the\r\ntemperature rises.[202] At 44.2deg, however, paratoluidine in contact with\r\nwater melts, and two liquid phases are formed, viz. a solution of water in\r\nfused paratoluidine and a solution of fused paratoluidine in water. We\r\nhave, therefore, the phenomenon of _melting under the solvent_. This\r\nmelting point will, of course, be lower than the melting point of the pure\r\nsubstance, because the solid is now in contact with a solution, and, as we\r\nhave already seen, addition of a foreign substance lowers the melting\r\npoint. Such cases of melting under the solvent are by no means rare, and a\r\nreview of the relationships met with may, therefore, be undertaken here. As\r\nan example, there may be chosen the equilibrium between succinic nitrile,\r\nC_{2}H_{4}(CN)_{2} and water, which has been fully studied by\r\nSchreinemakers.[203]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 30.]\r\n\r\nIf to the system ice--water at 0deg succinic nitrile is added, the\r\ntemperature will fall; and continued addition of the nitrile will lead at\r\nlast to the cryohydric point _b_ (Fig. 30), at which solid nitrile, ice,\r\nsolution, and vapour can coexist. The temperature of the cryohydric point\r\nis -1.2deg, and the composition of the solution is 1.29 mol. of nitrile in\r\n100 mol. of solution. From _a_ to _b_ the solid phase in contact with the\r\nsolution is ice. {123} If the temperature be now raised so as to cause the\r\ndisappearance of the ice, and the addition of nitrile be continued, the\r\nconcentration of the nitrile in the solution will increase as represented\r\nby the curve _bc_. At the point _c_ (18.5deg), when the concentration of\r\nthe nitrile in the solution has increased to 2.5 molecules per cent., the\r\nnitrile melts and two liquid phases are formed; the concentration of the\r\nnitrile in these two phases is given by the points _c_ and _c'_. As there\r\nare now four phases present, viz. solid nitrile, solution of fused nitrile\r\nin water, solution of water in fused nitrile, and vapour, the system is\r\n_invariant_. Since at this point the concentration, temperature, and\r\npressure are completely defined, addition or withdrawal of heat can only\r\ncause a change in the relative amounts of the phases, _but no variation of\r\nthe concentrations_ of the respective phases. As a matter of fact,\r\ncontinued addition of nitrile and addition of heat will cause an increase\r\nin the amount of the liquid phase containing excess of nitrile (_i.e._ the\r\nsolution of water in fused nitrile), whereas the other liquid phase, the\r\nsolution of fused nitrile in water, will gradually disappear. When it has\r\ncompletely disappeared, the system will be represented by the point _c'_,\r\nwhere the molecular concentration of nitrile is now 75 per cent., and again\r\nbecomes univariant, the three phases being solid nitrile, liquid phase\r\ncontaining excess of nitrile, and vapour; and as the amount of the water is\r\ndiminished the temperature of equilibrium rises, until at 54deg the melting\r\npoint of the pure nitrile is reached.\r\n\r\nReturn now to the point c. At this point there exists the invariant system\r\nsolid nitrile, two liquid phases, vapour. If heat be added, the solid\r\nnitrile will disappear, and there will be left the univariant system,\r\nconsisting of two liquid phases and vapour.[204] Such a system will exhibit\r\nrelationships similar to those already studied in the previous chapter. As\r\nthe temperature rises, the mutual solubility of the two fused components\r\nbecomes greater, until at _d_ (55.5deg) the critical solution temperature\r\nis reached, and the fused components become miscible in all proportions.\r\n\r\nAt all temperatures and concentrations lying to the right {124} of the\r\ncurve _abcdc'e_ there can be only one liquid phase; in the field _cdc'_\r\nthere are two liquid phases.\r\n\r\nFrom the figure it will be easy to see what will be the result of bringing\r\ntogether succinic nitrile and water at different temperatures and in\r\ndifferent amounts. Since _b_ is the lowest temperature at which liquid can\r\nexist in stable equilibrium with solid, ice and succinic nitrile can be\r\nmixed in any proportions at temperatures below _b_ without undergoing\r\nchange. Between _b_ and _c_ succinic nitrile will be dissolved until the\r\nconcentration reaches the value on the curve _bc_, corresponding to the\r\ngiven temperature. On adding the nitrile to water at temperatures between\r\n_c_ and _d_, it will dissolve until a concentration lying on the curve _cd_\r\nis attained; at this point two liquid phases will be formed, and further\r\naddition of nitrile will cause the one liquid phase (that containing excess\r\nof nitrile) to increase, while the other liquid phase will decrease, until\r\nit finally disappears and there is only one liquid phase left, that\r\ncontaining excess of nitrile. This can dissolve further quantities of the\r\nnitrile, and the concentration will increase until the curve _c'e_ is\r\nreached, when the concentration will remain unchanged, and addition of\r\nsolid will merely increase the amount of the solid phase.\r\n\r\nIf a solution represented by any point in the field lying below the curve\r\n_bcd_ is heated to a temperature above _d_, the critical solution\r\ntemperature, then the concentration of the nitrile can be increased to any\r\ndesired amount without at any time two liquid phases making their\r\nappearance; the system can then be cooled down to a temperature represented\r\nby any point between the curves _dc'e_. In this way it is possible to pass\r\ncontinuously from a solution containing excess of one component to\r\nsolutions containing excess of the other, as represented by the dotted line\r\n_xxxx_ (_v._ p. 100). At no point is there formation of two liquid phases.\r\n\r\nSupersaturation.--Just as suspended transformation is rarely met with in\r\nthe passage from the solid to the liquid state, so also it is found in the\r\ncase of the melting of substances under the solvent that suspended fusion\r\ndoes not occur; but that when the temperature of the invariant point is\r\nreached at which, therefore, the formation of two liquid layers is\r\npossible, {125} these two liquid layers, as a matter of fact, make their\r\nappearance. Suspended transformation can, however, take place from the side\r\nof the liquid phase, just as water or other liquid can be cooled below the\r\nnormal freezing point without solidification occurring. The question,\r\ntherefore, arises as to the relative solubilities of the solid and the\r\nsupercooled liquid at the same temperature.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 31.]\r\n\r\nThe answer to this question can at once be given from what we have already\r\nlearned (p. 113), if we recollect that at temperatures below the point of\r\nfusion under the solvent, the solid form, at temperatures above that point,\r\nthe liquid form, is the more stable; at this temperature, therefore, the\r\nrelative stability of the solid and liquid forms changes. Since, as we have\r\nalready seen, the less stable form has the greater solubility, it follows\r\nthat the supercooled liquid, being the less stable form, must have the\r\ngreater solubility. This was first proved experimentally by Alexejeff[205]\r\nin the case of benzoic acid and water, the solubility curves for which are\r\ngiven in Fig. 31. As can be seen from the figure, the prolongation of the\r\ncurve for liquid--liquid, which represents the solubility of the\r\nsupercooled liquid benzoic acid, lies above that for the solubility of the\r\n{126} solid benzoic acid in water; the solution saturated with respect to\r\nthe supercooled liquid is therefore supersaturated with respect to the\r\nsolid form. A similar behaviour has been found in the case of other\r\nsubstances.[206]\r\n\r\nPressure-Temperature Diagram.--Having considered the changes which occur in\r\nthe concentration of the components in a solution with the temperature, we\r\nmay conclude the discussion of the equilibrium between a salt and water by\r\nstudying the variation of the vapour pressure.\r\n\r\nSince in systems of two components the two phases, solution and vapour,\r\nconstitute a bivariant system, the vapour pressure is undefined, and may\r\nhave different values at the same temperature, depending on the\r\nconcentration. In order that there may be for each temperature a definite\r\ncorresponding pressure of the vapour, a third phase must be present. This\r\ncondition is satisfied by the system solid--liquid (solution)--vapour; that\r\nis, by the saturated solution (p. 108). In the case of a saturated\r\nsolution, therefore, the pressure of the vapour at any given temperature is\r\nconstant.\r\n\r\nVapour Pressure of Solid--Solution--Vapour.--It has long been known that\r\nthe addition of a non-volatile solid to a liquid in which it is soluble\r\nlowers the vapour pressure of the solvent; and the diminution of the\r\npressure is approximately proportional to the amount of substance dissolved\r\n(Law of Babo). The vapour-pressure curve, therefore, of a solution of a\r\nsalt in water must lie below that for pure water. Further, in the case of a\r\npure liquid, the vaporization curve is a function only of the temperature\r\n(p. 63), whereas, in the case of a solution, the pressure varies both with\r\nthe temperature and the _concentration_. These two factors, however, act in\r\nopposite directions; for although the vapour pressure in all cases\r\nincreases as the temperature rises, increase of concentration, as we have\r\nseen, lowers the vapour pressure. Again, since the concentration itself\r\nvaries with the temperature, two cases have to be considered, viz. where\r\nthe concentration increases with rise of {127} temperature, and where the\r\nconcentration diminishes with rise of temperature.\r\n\r\nThe relations which are found here will be best understood with the help of\r\nFig. 32.[207] In this figure, OB represents the sublimation curve of ice,\r\nand BC the vaporization curve of water; the curve for the solution must lie\r\nbelow this, and must cut the sublimation curve of ice at some temperature\r\nbelow the melting point. The point of intersection A is the cryohydric\r\npoint. If the solubility increases with rise of temperature, the increase\r\nof the vapour pressure due to the latter will be partially annulled. Since\r\nat first the effect of increase of temperature more than counteracts the\r\ndepressing action of increase of concentration, the vapour pressure will\r\nincrease on raising the temperature above the cryohydric point. If the\r\nelevation of temperature is continued, however, to the melting point of the\r\nsalt, the effect of increasing concentration makes itself more and more\r\nfelt, so that the vapour-pressure curve of the solution falls more and more\r\nbelow that of the pure liquid, and the pressure will ultimately become\r\nequal to that of the pure salt; that is to say, practically equal to zero.\r\nThe curve will therefore be of the general form AMF shown in Fig. 32. If\r\nthe solubility should diminish with rise of temperature, the two factors,\r\ntemperature and concentration, will act in the same direction, and the\r\nvapour-pressure curve will rise relatively more rapid than that of the pure\r\nliquid; since, however, the pure salt is ultimately obtained, the\r\nvapour-pressure curve must in this case also finally approach the value\r\nzero.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 32.]\r\n\r\nOther Univariant Systems.--Besides the univariant system {128}\r\nsalt--solution--vapour already considered, three others are possible, viz.\r\nice--solution--vapour, ice--salt--solution, and ice--salt--vapour.\r\n\r\nThe fusion point of a substance is lowered, as we have seen, by the\r\naddition of a foreign substance, and the depression is all the greater the\r\nlarger the quantity of substance added. The vapour pressure of the water,\r\nalso, is lowered by the solution in it of other substances, so that the\r\nvapour pressure of the system ice--solution--vapour must decrease as the\r\ntemperature falls from the fusion point of ice to the cryohydric point.\r\nThis curve is represented by BA (Fig. 32), and is coincident with the\r\nsublimation curve of ice.\r\n\r\nThis, at first sight, strange fact will be readily understood when we\r\nconsider that since ice and solution are together in equilibrium with the\r\nsame vapour, they must have the same vapour pressure. For suppose at any\r\ngiven temperature equilibrium to have been established in the system\r\nice--solution--vapour, removal of the ice will not alter this equilibrium.\r\nSuppose, now, the ice and the solution placed under a bell-jar so that they\r\nhave a common vapour, but are not themselves in contact; then, if they do\r\nnot have the same vapour pressure, distillation must take place and the\r\nsolution will become more dilute or more concentrated. Since, at the\r\ncompletion of this process, the ice and solution are now in equilibrium\r\nwhen they are not in contact, they must also be in equilibrium when they\r\nare in contact (p. 32). But if distillation has taken place the\r\nconcentration of the solution must have altered, so that the ice will now\r\nbe in equilibrium with a solution of a different concentration from before.\r\nBut according to the Phase Rule ice cannot at one and the same temperature\r\nbe in equilibrium with two solutions of different concentration, for the\r\nsystem ice--solution--vapour is univariant, and at any given temperature,\r\ntherefore, not only the pressure but also the _concentration of the\r\ncomponents in the solution must be constant_. Distillation could not,\r\ntherefore, take place from the ice to the solution or _vice versa_; that is\r\nto say, the solution and the ice must have the same vapour pressure--the\r\nsublimation pressure of ice. The reason of the coincidence is the\r\nnon-volatility of the salt: had {129} the salt a measurable vapour pressure\r\nitself, the sublimation curve of ice and the curve for\r\nice--solution--vapour would no longer fall together.\r\n\r\nThe curve AO represents the pressures of the system ice--salt--vapour. This\r\ncurve will also be coincident with the sublimation curve of ice, on account\r\nof the non-volatility of the salt.\r\n\r\nThe equilibria of the fourth univariant system ice--salt--solution are\r\nrepresented by AE. Since this is a condensed system, the effect of a small\r\nchange of temperature will be to cause a large change of pressure, as in\r\nthe case of the fusion point of a pure substance. The direction of this\r\ncurve will depend on whether there is an increase or diminution of volume\r\non solidification; but the effect in any given case can be predicted with\r\nthe help of the theorem of Le Chatelier.\r\n\r\nSince the cryohydric point is a quadruple point in a two-component system,\r\nit represents an invariant system. The condition of the system is,\r\ntherefore, completely defined; the four phases, ice, salt, solution,\r\nvapour, can co-exist only when the temperature, pressure, and concentration\r\nof the solution have constant and definite values. Addition or withdrawal\r\nof heat, therefore, can cause no alteration of the condition of the system\r\nexcept a variation of the relative amounts of the phases. Addition\r\nof heat at constant volume will ultimately lead to the system\r\nsalt--solution--vapour or the system ice--solution--vapour, according as\r\nice or salt disappears first. This is readily apparent from the diagram\r\n(Fig. 32), for the systems ice--salt--solution and ice--salt--vapour can\r\nexist only at temperatures below the cryohydric point (provided the curve\r\nfor ice--salt--solution slopes towards the pressure axis).\r\n\r\nBivariant Systems.--Besides the univariant systems already discussed,\r\nvarious bivariant systems are possible, the conditions for the existence of\r\nwhich are represented by the different areas of Fig. 32. They are as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n  _Area._             _System._\r\n\r\n  OAMF     Salt--vapour.\r\n  CBAMF    Solution--vapour; salt--solution.\r\n  EABD     Salt--solution; ice--solution.\r\n  EAO      Ice--salt.\r\n\r\n{130}\r\n\r\nDeliquescence.--As is evident from Fig. 32, salt can exist in contact with\r\nwater vapour at pressures under those represented by OAMF. If, however, the\r\npressure of the vapour is increased until it reaches a value lying on this\r\ncurve at temperatures above the cryohydric point, solution will be formed;\r\nfor the curve AMF represents the equilibria between salt--solution--vapour.\r\nFrom this, therefore, it is clear that if the pressure of the aqueous\r\nvapour in the atmosphere is greater than that of the saturated solution of\r\na salt, that salt will, on being placed in the air, form a solution; it\r\nwill _deliquesce_.\r\n\r\nSeparation of Salt on Evaporation.--With the help of Fig. 32 it is possible\r\nto state in a general manner whether or not salt will be deposited when a\r\nsolution is evaporated under a constant pressure.[208]\r\n\r\nThe curve AMF (Fig. 32) is the vapour-pressure curve of the saturated\r\nsolutions of the salt, _i.e._ it represents, as we have seen, the maximum\r\nvapour pressure at which salt can exist in contact with solution and\r\nvapour. The dotted line _aa_ represents atmospheric pressure. If, now, an\r\nunsaturated solution, the composition of which is represented by the point\r\n_x_, is heated in an open vessel, the temperature will rise, and the vapour\r\npressure of the solution will increase. The system will, therefore, pass\r\nalong a line represented diagrammatically by _xx'_. At the point _x'_ the\r\nvapour pressure of the system becomes equal to 1 atm.; and as the vessel is\r\nopen to the air, the pressure cannot further rise; the solution boils. If\r\nthe heating is continued, water passes off, the concentration increases,\r\nand the boiling point rises. The system will therefore pass along the line\r\n_x'm_, until at the point _m_ solid salt separates out (provided\r\nsupersaturation is excluded). The system is now univariant, and continued\r\nheating will no longer cause an alteration of the concentration; as water\r\npasses off, solid salt will be deposited, and the solution will evaporate\r\nto dryness.\r\n\r\nIf, however, the atmospheric pressure is represented not by _aa_ but by\r\n_bb_, then, as Fig. 32 shows, the maximum vapour {131} pressure of the\r\nsystem salt--solution--vapour never reaches the pressure of 1 atm. Further,\r\nsince the curve _bb_ lies in the area of the bivariant system\r\nsolution--vapour there can at no point be a separation of the solid form;\r\nfor the system solid--solution--vapour can exist only along the curve AMF.\r\n\r\nOn evaporating the solution of a salt in an open vessel, therefore, salt\r\ncan be deposited only if at some temperature the pressure of the saturated\r\nsolution is equal to the atmospheric pressure. This is found to be the case\r\nwith most salts. In the case of aqueous solutions of sodium and potassium\r\nhydroxide, however, the vapour pressure of the saturated solution never\r\nreaches the value of 1 atm., and on evaporating these solutions, therefore,\r\nin an open vessel, there is no separation of the solid. Only a homogeneous\r\nfused mass is obtained. If, however, the evaporation be carried out under a\r\npressure which is lower than the maximum pressure of the saturated\r\nsolution, separation of the solid substance will be possible.\r\n\r\nGeneral Summary.--The systems which have been discussed in the present\r\nchapter contained water as one of their components, and an anhydrous salt\r\nas the other. It will, however, be clear that the relationships which were\r\nfound in the case of these will be found also in other cases where it is a\r\nquestion of the equilibria between two components, which crystallize out in\r\nthe pure state, and only one of which possesses a measurable vapour\r\npressure. A similar behaviour will, for example, be found in the case of\r\nmany pairs of organic substances; and in all cases the equilibria will be\r\nrepresented by a diagram of the general appearance of Fig. 29 or Fig. 30.\r\nThat is to say: Starting from the fusion point of component I., the system\r\nwill pass, by progressive addition of component II., to regions of lower\r\ntemperature, until at last the cryohydric or eutectic point is reached. On\r\nfurther addition of component II., the system will pass to regions of\r\nhigher temperature, the solid phase now being component II. If the fused\r\ncomponents are miscible with one another in all proportions a continuous\r\ncurve will be obtained leading up to the point of fusion of component II.\r\nSlight changes of direction, it is true, due to changes in the crystalline\r\nform, may be found along this curve, {132} but throughout its whole course\r\nthere will be but one liquid phase. If, on the other hand, the fused\r\ncomponents are not miscible in all proportions, then the second curve will\r\nexhibit a marked discontinuity, and two liquid phases will make their\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{133}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nSOLUTIONS OF SOLIDS IN LIQUIDS, ONLY ONE OF THE COMPONENTS BEING VOLATILE\r\n\r\nB.--HYDRATED SALT AND WATER.\r\n\r\nIn the preceding chapter we discussed the behaviour of systems formed of\r\ntwo components, only one of which was volatile, in those cases where the\r\ntwo components separated from solution in the pure state. In the present\r\nchapter we shall consider those systems in which combination between the\r\ncomponents can occur with the formation of definite compounds; such as are\r\nfound in the case of crystalline salt hydrates. Since a not inconsiderable\r\namount of study has been devoted to the systems formed by hydrated salts\r\nand water, systems which are of great chemical interest and importance, the\r\nbehaviour of these will first call for discussion in some detail, and it\r\nwill be found later that the relationships which exist in such systems\r\nappear also in a large number of other two-component systems.\r\n\r\nThe systems belonging to this group may be divided into two classes\r\naccording as the compounds formed possess a definite melting point, _i.e._\r\nform a liquid phase of the same composition, or do not do so. We shall\r\nconsider the latter first.\r\n\r\n1. _The Compounds formed do not have a Definite Melting Point._\r\n\r\nConcentration-Temperature Diagram.--In the case of salts which can form\r\ncrystalline hydrates, the temperature-concentration diagram, representing\r\nthe equilibria of the {134} different possible systems, must necessarily be\r\nsomewhat more complicated than where no such combination of the components\r\noccurs. For, as has already been pointed out, each substance has its own\r\nsolubility curve; and there will therefore be as many solubility curves as\r\nthere are solid phases possible, _the curve for each particular solid phase\r\nbeing continuous so long as it remains unchanged in contact with the\r\nsolution_. As an example of the relationships met with in such cases, we\r\nshall first of all consider the systems formed of sodium sulphate and\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 33.]\r\n\r\nSodium Sulphate and Water.--At the ordinary temperatures, sodium sulphate\r\ncrystallises from water with ten molecules of water of crystallisation,\r\nforming Glauber's salt. On determining the solubility of this salt in\r\nwater, it is found that the solubility increases as the temperature rises,\r\nthe values of the solubility, represented graphically by the curve AC (Fig.\r\n33), being given in the following table.[209] The numbers denote grams of\r\nsodium sulphate, calculated as anhydrous salt, dissolved by 100 grams of\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n  SOLUBILITY OF Na_{2}SO_{4},10H_{2}O.\r\n\r\n  --------------------------\r\n  Temperature. | Solubility.\r\n  --------------------------\r\n      0deg     |     5.02\r\n     10deg     |     9.00\r\n     15deg     |    13.20\r\n     18deg     |    16.80\r\n     20deg     |    19.40\r\n     25deg     |    28.00\r\n     30deg     |    40.00\r\n     33deg     |    50.76\r\n     34deg     |    55.00\r\n  --------------------------\r\n\r\n{135}\r\n\r\nOn continuing the investigation at higher temperatures, it was found that\r\nthe solubility no longer increased, but _decreased with rise of\r\ntemperature_. At the same time, it was observed that the solid phase was\r\nnow different from that in contact with the solution at temperatures below\r\n33deg; for whereas in the latter case the solid phase was sodium sulphate\r\ndecahydrate, at temperatures above 33deg the solid phase was the anhydrous\r\nsalt. The course of the solubility curve of anhydrous sodium sulphate is\r\nshown by BD, and the values of the solubility are given in the following\r\ntable:--[210]\r\n\r\n  SOLUBILITY OF ANHYDROUS SODIUM SULPHATE.\r\n\r\n  --------------------------\r\n  Temperature. | Solubility.\r\n  --------------------------\r\n   18deg       |    53.25\r\n   20deg       |    52.76\r\n   25deg       |    51.53\r\n   30deg       |    50.37\r\n   33deg       |    49.71\r\n   34deg       |    49.53\r\n   36deg       |    49.27\r\n   40.15deg    |    48.78\r\n   50.40deg    |    46.82\r\n  --------------------------\r\n\r\nAs is evident from the figure, the solubility curve which is obtained when\r\nanhydrous sodium sulphate is present as the solid phase, cuts the curve\r\nrepresenting the solubility of the decahydrate, at a temperature of about\r\n33deg.\r\n\r\nIf a solution of sodium sulphate which has been saturated at a temperature\r\nof about 34deg be cooled down to a temperature below 17deg, while care is\r\ntaken that the solution is protected against access of particles of\r\nGlauber's salt, crystals of a second hydrate of sodium sulphate, having the\r\ncomposition Na_{2}SO_{4},7H_{2}O, separate out. On determining the\r\ncomposition of the solutions in equilibrium with this hydrate at different\r\ntemperatures, the following values were obtained, these values being\r\nrepresented by the curve FE (Fig. 33):--\r\n\r\n{136}\r\n\r\n  SOLUBILITY OF Na_{2}SO_{4},7H_{2}O.\r\n\r\n  --------------------------\r\n  Temperature. | Solubility.\r\n  --------------------------\r\n      0deg     |    19.62\r\n     10deg     |    30.49\r\n     15deg     |    37.43\r\n     18deg     |    41.63\r\n     20deg     |    44.73\r\n     25deg     |    52.94\r\n     26deg     |    54.97\r\n  --------------------------\r\n\r\nSince, as has already been stated, each solid substance has its own\r\nsolubility curve, there are three separate curves to be considered in the\r\ncase of sodium sulphate and water. Where two curves cut, the solution must\r\nbe saturated with respect to two solid phases; at the point B, therefore,\r\nthe point of intersection of the solubility curve of anhydrous sodium\r\nsulphate with that of the decahydrate, the solution must be saturated with\r\nrespect to these two solid substances. But a system of two components\r\nexisting in four phases, anhydrous salt--hydrated salt--solution--vapour,\r\nis invariant; and this invariability will remain even if only three phases\r\nare present, provided that one of the factors, pressure, temperature, or\r\nconcentration of components retains a constant value. This is the case when\r\nsolubilities are determined in open vessels; the pressure is then equal to\r\natmospheric pressure. Under these circumstances, then, the system,\r\nanhydrous sodium sulphate--decahydrate--solution, will possess no degree of\r\nfreedom, and can exist, therefore, only at one definite temperature and\r\nwhen the solution has a certain definite composition. The temperature of\r\nthis point is 32.482deg on a mercury thermometer, or 32.379deg on the\r\nhydrogen thermometer.[211]\r\n\r\n{137}\r\n\r\nSuspended Transformation.--Although it is possible for the anhydrous salt\r\nto make its appearance at the temperature of the quadruple point, it will\r\nnot necessarily do so; and it is therefore possible to follow the\r\nsolubility curve of sodium sulphate decahydrate to a higher temperature.\r\nSince, however, the solubility of the decahydrate at temperatures above the\r\nquadruple point is greater than that of the anhydrous salt, the solution\r\nwhich is _saturated_ with respect to the former will be _supersaturated_\r\nwith respect to the latter. On bringing a small quantity of the anhydrous\r\nsalt in contact with the solution, therefore, anhydrous salt will be\r\ndeposited; and all the hydrated salt present will ultimately undergo\r\nconversion into the anhydrous salt, through the medium of the solution. In\r\nthis case, as in all cases, the solid phase, which is the most stable at\r\nthe temperature of the experiment, has at that temperature the least\r\nsolubility.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the solubility curve of anhydrous sodium sulphate has been\r\nfollowed to temperatures below 32.5deg. Below this temperature, however,\r\nthe solubility of this salt is greater than that of the decahydrate, and\r\nthe saturated solution of the anhydrous salt will therefore be\r\nsupersaturated for the decahydrate, and will deposit this salt if a\r\n\"nucleus\" is added to the solution. From this we see that at temperatures\r\nabove 32.5deg the anhydrous salt is the stable form, while the decahydrate\r\nis unstable (or metastable); at temperatures below 32.5deg the decahydrate\r\nis stable. This temperature, therefore, is the _transition temperature_ for\r\ndecahydrate and anhydrous salt.\r\n\r\nFrom Fig. 33 we see further that the solubility curve of the anhydrous salt\r\n(which at all temperatures below 32.5deg is metastable) is cut by the\r\nsolubility curve of the heptahydrate; and this point of intersection (at a\r\ntemperature of 24.2deg) must be the _transition point_ for heptahydrate and\r\nanhydrous salt. Since at all temperatures the solubility of the\r\nheptahydrate is greater than that of the decahydrate, the former hydrate\r\nmust be metastable with respect to the latter; so that throughout its whole\r\ncourse the solubility curve of the heptahydrate {138} represents only\r\nmetastable equilibria. Sodium sulphate, therefore, forms only one stable\r\nhydrate, the decahydrate.\r\n\r\nThe solubility relations of sodium sulphate illustrate very clearly the\r\nimportance of the solid phase for the definition of saturation and\r\nsupersaturation. Since the solubility curve of the anhydrous salt has been\r\nfollowed backwards to a temperature of about 18deg, it is readily seen,\r\nfrom Fig. 33, that at a temperature of, say, 20deg three different\r\n_saturated_ solutions of sodium sulphate are possible, according as the\r\nanhydrous salt, the heptahydrate or the decahydrate, is present as the\r\nsolid phase. Two of these solutions, however, would be metastable and\r\n_supersaturated with respect to the decahydrate_.\r\n\r\nFurther, the behaviour of sodium sulphate and water furnishes a very good\r\nexample of the fact that a \"break\" in the solubility curve occurs when, and\r\nonly when, the solid phase undergoes change. So long as the decahydrate,\r\nfor example, remained unaltered in contact with the solution, the\r\nsolubility curve was continuous; but when the anhydrous salt appeared in\r\nthe solid phase, a distinct change in the direction of the solubility curve\r\nwas observed.\r\n\r\nDehydration by Means of Anhydrous Sodium Sulphate.--The change in the\r\nrelative stability of sodium sulphate decahydrate and anhydrous salt in\r\npresence of water at a temperature of 32.5deg explains why the latter salt\r\ncannot be employed for dehydration purposes at temperatures above the\r\ntransition point. The dehydrating action of the anhydrous salt depends on\r\nthe formation of the decahydrate; but since at temperatures above 33deg the\r\nlatter is unstable, and cannot be formed in presence of the anhydrous salt,\r\nthis salt cannot, of course, effect a dehydration above that temperature.\r\n\r\nPressure-Temperature Diagram.--The consideration of the\r\npressure-temperature relations of the two components, sodium sulphate and\r\nwater, must include not only the vapour pressure of the saturated\r\nsolutions, but also that of the crystalline hydrates. The vapour pressures\r\nof salt hydrates have already been treated in a general manner (Chap. V.),\r\nso that it is only necessary here to point out the connection between the\r\ntwo classes of systems. {139}\r\n\r\nIn most cases the vapour pressure of a salt hydrate, _i.e._ the vapour\r\npressure of the system hydrate--anhydrous salt (or lower hydrate)--vapour,\r\nis at all temperatures lower than that of the system anhydrous salt (or\r\nlower hydrate)--solution--vapour. This, however, is not a necessity; and\r\ncases are known where the vapour pressure of the former system is, under\r\ncertain circumstances, equal to or higher than that of the latter. An\r\nexample of this is found in sodium sulphate decahydrate.\r\n\r\nOn heating Na_{2}SO_{4},10H_{2}O, a point is reached at which the\r\ndissociation pressure into anhydrous salt and water vapour becomes equal to\r\nthe vapour pressure of the saturated solution of the anhydrous salt, as is\r\napparent from the following measurements;[212] the differences in pressure\r\nbeing expressed in millimetres of a particular oil.\r\n\r\n  Temperature:      29.0deg 30.83deg 31.79deg 32.09deg 32.35deg 32.6deg\r\n  Difference of\r\n  pressure:         23.8    10.8      5.6      3.6      1.6      0\r\n\r\nAt 32.6deg, therefore, the vapour pressures of the two systems\r\n\r\n  Na_{2}SO_{4},10H_{2}O--Na_{2}SO_{4}--vapour\r\n  Na_{2}SO_{4}--solution--vapour\r\n\r\nare equal; at this temperature the four phases, Na_{2}SO_{4},10H_{2}O;\r\nNa_{2}SO_{4}; solution; vapour, can coexist. From this it is evident that\r\nwhen sodium sulphate decahydrate is heated to 32.6deg, the two new phases\r\nanhydrous salt and solution will be formed (suspended transformation being\r\nsupposed excluded), and the hydrate will appear to undergo _partial\r\nfusion_; and during the process of \"melting\" the vapour pressure and\r\ntemperature will remain constant.[213] This is, however, not a true but a\r\nso-called _incongruent_ melting point; for the composition of the liquid\r\nphase is not the same as that of the solid. As has already been pointed out\r\n(p. 137), we are dealing here with the _transition point_ of the\r\ndecahydrate and anhydrous salt, _i.e._ with the reaction\r\nNa_{2}SO_{4},10H_{2}O <--> Na_{2}SO_{4} + 10H_{2}O.\r\n\r\nSince at the point of partial fusion of the decahydrate four {140} phases\r\ncan coexist, the point is a quadruple point in a two-component system, and\r\nthe system at this point is therefore invariant. The temperature of this\r\npoint is therefore perfectly definite, and on this account the proposal has\r\nbeen made to adopt this as a fixed point in thermometry.[214] The\r\ntemperature is, of course, practically the same as that at which the two\r\nsolubility curves intersect (p. 112). If, however, the vapour phase\r\ndisappears, the system becomes univariant, and the equilibrium temperature\r\nundergoes change with change of pressure. The transition curve has been\r\ndetermined by Tammann,[215] and shown to pass through a point of maximum\r\ntemperature.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 34.]\r\n\r\nThe vapour pressure of the different systems of sodium sulphate and water\r\ncan best be studied with the help of the diagram in Fig. 34.[216] The curve\r\nABCD represents the vapour-pressure curve of the saturated solution of\r\nanhydrous sodium sulphate. GC is the pressure curve of decahydrate +\r\nanhydrous salt, which, as we have seen, cuts the curve ABCD at the\r\ntransition temperature, 32.6deg. Since at this point the solution is\r\nsaturated with respect to both the anhydrous salt and the decahydrate, the\r\nvapour-pressure curve of the saturated solution of the latter must also\r\npass through the point C.[217] As at temperatures below this point the\r\nsolubility of the decahydrate is less than that of the anhydrous salt, the\r\nvapour pressure of the solution will, in accordance with Babo's law\r\n(p. 126), be higher than that of the solution of the anhydrous salt; which\r\nwas also found experimentally to be the case (curve HC).\r\n\r\n{141}\r\n\r\nIn connection with the vapour pressure of the saturated solutions of the\r\nanhydrous salt and the decahydrate, attention must be drawn to a\r\nconspicuous deviation from what was found to hold in the case of\r\none-component systems in which a vapour phase was present (p. 31). There,\r\nit was seen that the vapour pressure of the more stable system was always\r\n_lower_ than that of the less stable; in the present case, however, we find\r\nthat this is no longer so. We have already learned that at temperatures\r\nbelow 32.5deg the system decahydrate--solution--vapour is more stable than\r\nthe system anhydrous salt--solution--vapour; but the vapour pressure of the\r\nlatter system is, as has just been stated, lower than that of the former.\r\nAt temperatures above the transition point the vapour pressure of the\r\nsaturated solution of the decahydrate will be lower than that of the\r\nsaturated solution of the anhydrous salt.\r\n\r\nThis behaviour depends on the fact that the less stable form is the more\r\nsoluble, and that the diminution of the vapour pressure increases with the\r\namount of salt dissolved.\r\n\r\nWith regard to sodium sulphate heptahydrate the same considerations will\r\nhold as in the case of the decahydrate. Since at 24deg the four phases\r\nheptahydrate, anhydrous salt, solution, vapour can coexist, the\r\nvapour-pressure curves of the systems hydrate--anhydrous salt--vapour\r\n(curve EB) and hydrate--solution--vapour (curve FB) must cut the pressure\r\ncurve of the saturated solution of the anhydrous salt at the above\r\ntemperature, as represented in Fig. 34 by the point B. This constitutes,\r\ntherefore, a second quadruple point, which is, however, metastable.\r\n\r\nFrom the diagram it is also evident that the dissociation pressure of the\r\nheptahydrate is higher than that of the decahydrate, although it contains\r\nless water of crystallization. The system heptahydrate--anhydrous\r\nsalt--vapour must be metastable with respect to the system\r\ndecahydrate--anhydrous salt--vapour, and will pass into the latter.[218]\r\nWhether or not there is a temperature at which the vapour-pressure curves\r\nof the two systems intersect, and below which the heptahydrate becomes the\r\nmore stable form, is not known.\r\n\r\n{142}\r\n\r\nIn the case of sodium sulphate there is only one stable hydrate. Other\r\nsalts are known which exhibit a similar behaviour; and we shall therefore\r\nexpect that the solubility relationships will be represented by a diagram\r\nsimilar to that for sodium sulphate. A considerable number of such cases\r\nhave, indeed, been found,[219] and in some cases there is more than one\r\nmetastable hydrate. This is found, for example, in the case of nickel\r\niodate,[220] the solubility curves for which are given in Fig. 35. As can\r\nbe seen from the figure, suspended transformation occurs, the solubility\r\ncurves having in some cases been followed to a considerable distance beyond\r\nthe transition point. One of the most brilliant examples, however, of\r\nsuspended transformation in the case of salt hydrates, and the sluggish\r\ntransition from the less stable to the more stable form, is found in the\r\ncase of the hydrates of calcium chromate.[221]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 35.]\r\n\r\nIn the preceding cases, the dissociation-pressure curve of the hydrated\r\nsalt cuts the vapour-pressure curve of the saturated {143} solution of the\r\nanhydrous salt. It can, however, happen that the dissociation-pressure\r\ncurve of one hydrate cuts the solubility curve, not of the anhydrous salt,\r\nbut of a lower hydrate; in this case there will be more than one stable\r\nhydrate, each having a stable solubility curve; and these curves will\r\nintersect at the temperature of the transition point. Various examples of\r\nthis behaviour are known, and we choose for illustration the solubility\r\nrelationships of barium acetate and its hydrates[222] (Fig. 36).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 36.]\r\n\r\nAt temperatures above 0deg, barium acetate can form two stable hydrates, a\r\ntrihydrate and a monohydrate. The solubility of the trihydrate increases\r\nvery rapidly with rise of temperature, and has been determined up to\r\n26.1deg. At temperatures above 24.7deg, however, the trihydrate is\r\nmetastable with respect to the monohydrate; for at this temperature the\r\nsolubility curve of the latter hydrate cuts that of the former. This is,\r\ntherefore, the transition temperature for the trihydrate and monohydrate.\r\nThe solubility curve of the monohydrate succeeds that of the trihydrate,\r\nand exhibits a conspicuous point of minimum solubility at about 30deg.\r\nBelow 24.7deg the {144} monohydrate is the less stable hydrate, but its\r\nsolubility has been determined to a temperature of 22deg. At 41deg the\r\nsolubility curve of the monohydrate intersects that of the anhydrous salt,\r\nand this is therefore the transition temperature for the monohydrate and\r\nanhydrous salt. Above this temperature the anhydrous salt is the stable\r\nsolid phase. Its solubility curve also passes through a minimum.\r\n\r\nThe diagram of solubilities of barium acetate not only illustrates the way\r\nin which the solubility curves of the different stable hydrates of a salt\r\nsucceed one another, but it has also an interest and importance from\r\nanother point of view. In Fig. 36 there is also shown a faintly drawn curve\r\nwhich is continuous throughout its whole course. This curve represents the\r\nsolubility of barium acetate as determined by Krasnicki.[223] Since,\r\nhowever, three different solid phases can exist under the conditions of\r\nexperiment, it is evident, from what has already been stated (p. 111), that\r\nthe different equilibria between barium acetate and water could not be\r\nrepresented by one _continuous_ curve.\r\n\r\nAnother point which these experiments illustrate and which it is of the\r\nhighest importance to bear in mind is, that in making determinations of the\r\nsolubility of salts which are capable of forming hydrates, it is not only\r\nnecessary to determine the composition of the solution, but _it is of equal\r\nimportance to determine the composition of the solid phase in contact with\r\nit_. In view of the fact, also, that the solution equilibrium is in many\r\ncases established with comparative slowness, it is necessary to confirm the\r\npoint of equilibrium, either by approaching it from higher as well as from\r\nlower temperatures, or by actually determining the rate with which the\r\ncondition of equilibrium is attained. This can be accomplished by actual\r\nweighing of the dissolved salt or by determinations of the density of the\r\nsolution, as well as by other methods.\r\n\r\n{145}\r\n\r\n2. _The Compounds formed have a Definite Melting Point._\r\n\r\nIn the cases which have just been considered we saw that the salt hydrates\r\non being heated did not undergo complete fusion, but that a solid was\r\ndeposited consisting of a lower hydrate or of the anhydrous salt. It has,\r\nhowever, been long known that certain crystalline salt hydrates (_e.g._\r\nsodium thiosulphate, Na_{2}S_{2}O_{3},5H_{2}O, sodium acetate,\r\nNaC_{2}H_{3}O_{2},3H_{2}O) melt completely in their water of\r\ncrystallization, and yield a liquid of the _same composition_ as the\r\ncrystalline salt. In the case of sodium thiosulphate pentahydrate the\r\ntemperature of liquefaction is 56deg; in the case of sodium acetate\r\ntrihydrate, 58deg. These two salts, therefore, have a definite melting\r\npoint. For the purpose of studying the behaviour of such salt hydrates, we\r\nshall choose not the cases which have just been mentioned, but two others\r\nwhich have been more fully studied, viz. the hydrates of calcium chloride\r\nand of ferric chloride.\r\n\r\nSolubility Curve of Calcium Chloride Hexahydrate.[224]--Although calcium\r\nchloride forms several hydrates, each of which possesses its own\r\nsolubility, it is nevertheless the solubility curve of the hexahydrate\r\nwhich will chiefly interest us at present, and we shall therefore first\r\ndiscuss that curve by itself.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 37.]\r\n\r\nThe solubility of this salt has been determined from the cryohydric point,\r\nwhich lies at about -55deg, up to the melting point of the salt.[225] The\r\nsolubility increases with rise of temperature, as is shown by the figures\r\nin the following table, and by the (diagrammatic) curve AB in Fig. 37. In\r\nthe table, the numbers under the heading \"solubility\" denote the number of\r\ngrams of CaCl_{2} dissolved in 100 grams {146} of water; those under the\r\nheading \"composition,\" the number of gram-molecules of water in the\r\nsolution to one gram-molecule of CaCl_{2}.\r\n\r\n  SOLUBILITY OF CALCIUM CHLORIDE HEXAHYDRATE.\r\n\r\n  -----------------------------------------\r\n  Temperature. | Solubility. | Composition.\r\n  -----------------------------------------\r\n     -55deg    |     42.5    |    14.5\r\n     -25deg    |     50.0    |    12.3\r\n     -10deg    |     55.0    |    11.2\r\n       0deg    |     59.5    |    10.37\r\n      10deg    |     65.0    |     9.49\r\n      20deg    |     74.5    |     8.28\r\n      25deg    |     82.0    |     7.52\r\n      28.5deg  |     90.5    |     6.81\r\n      29.5deg  |     95.5    |     6.46\r\n      30.2deg  |    102.7    |     6.00\r\n      29.6deg  |    109.0    |     5.70\r\n      29.2deg  |    112.8    |     5.41\r\n  -----------------------------------------\r\n\r\nSo far as the first portion of the curve is concerned, it resembles the\r\nmost general type of solubility curve. In the present case the solubility\r\nis so great and increases so rapidly with rise of temperature, that a point\r\nis reached at which the water of crystallization of the salt is sufficient\r\nfor its complete solution. This temperature is 30.2deg; and since the\r\ncomposition of the solution is the same as that of the solid salt, viz. 1\r\nmol. of CaCl_{2} to 6 mols. of water, this temperature must be the melting\r\npoint of the hexahydrate. At this point the hydrate will fuse or the\r\nsolution will solidify without change of temperature and without change of\r\ncomposition. Such a melting point is called a _congruent_ melting point.\r\n\r\nBut the solubility curve of calcium chloride hexahydrate differs markedly\r\nfrom the other solubility curves hitherto considered in that it possesses a\r\n_retroflex portion_, represented in the figure by BC. As is evident from\r\nthe figure, therefore, calcium chloride hexahydrate exhibits the peculiar\r\nand, as it was at first thought, impossible behaviour that it can be in\r\nequilibrium at one and the same temperature with two different solutions,\r\none of which contains more, the other less, water than the solid hydrate;\r\nfor it must be remembered that {147} throughout the whole course of the\r\ncurve ABC the solid phase present in equilibrium with the solution is the\r\nhexahydrate.\r\n\r\nSuch a behaviour, however, on the part of calcium chloride hexahydrate will\r\nappear less strange if one reflects that the melting point of the hydrate\r\nwill, like the melting point of other substances, be lowered by the\r\naddition of a second substance. If, therefore, water is added to the\r\nhydrate at its melting point, the temperature at which the solid hydrate\r\nwill be in equilibrium with the liquid phase (solution) will be lowered; or\r\nif, on the other hand, anhydrous calcium chloride is added to the hydrate\r\nat its melting point (or what is the same thing, if water is removed from\r\nthe solution), the temperature at which the hydrate will be in equilibrium\r\nwith the liquid will also be lowered; _i.e._ the hydrate will melt at a\r\nlower temperature. In the former case we have the hydrate in equilibrium\r\nwith a solution containing more water, in the latter case with a solution\r\ncontaining less water than is contained in the hydrate itself.\r\n\r\nIt has already been stated (p. 109) that the solubility curve (in general,\r\nthe equilibrium curve) is continuous so long as the solid phase remains\r\nunchanged; and we shall therefore expect that the curve ABC will be\r\ncontinuous. Formerly, however, it was considered by some that the curve was\r\nnot continuous, but that the melting point is the point of intersection of\r\ntwo curves, a solubility curve and a fusion curve. Although the earlier\r\nsolubility determinations were insufficient to decide this point\r\nconclusively, more recent investigation has proved beyond doubt that the\r\ncurve is continuous and exhibits no break.[226]\r\n\r\n{148}\r\n\r\nAlthough in taking up the discussion of the equilibria between calcium\r\nchloride and water, it was desired especially to call attention to the form\r\nof the solubility curve in the case of salt hydrates possessing a definite\r\nmelting point, nevertheless, for the sake of completeness, brief mention\r\nmay be made of the other systems which these two components can form.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 38.]\r\n\r\nBesides the hexahydrate, the solubility curve of which has already been\r\ndescribed, calcium chloride can also crystallize in two different forms,\r\neach of which contains four molecules {149} of water of crystallization;\r\nthese are distinguished as [alpha]-tetrahydrate, and [beta]-tetrahydrate.\r\nTwo other hydrates are also known, viz. a dihydrate and a monohydrate. The\r\nsolubility curves of these different hydrates are given in Fig. 38.\r\n\r\nOn following the solubility curve of the hexahydrate from the ordinary\r\ntemperature upwards, it is seen that at a temperature of 29.8deg\r\nrepresented by the point H, it cuts the solubility curve of the\r\n[alpha]-tetrahydrate. This point is therefore a quadruple point at which\r\nthe four phases hexahydrate, [alpha]-tetrahydrate, solution, and vapour can\r\ncoexist. It is also the transition point for these two hydrates. Since, at\r\ntemperatures above 29.8deg, the [alpha]-tetrahydrate is the stable form, it\r\nis evident from the data given before (p. 146), as also from Fig. 38, that\r\nthe portion of the solubility curve of the hexahydrate lying above this\r\ntemperature represents _metastable_ equilibria. The realization of the\r\nmetastable melting point of the hexahydrate is, therefore, due to suspended\r\ntransformation. At the transition point, 29.8deg, the solubility of the\r\nhexahydrate and [alpha]-tetrahydrate is 100.6 parts of CaCl_{2} in 100\r\nparts of water.\r\n\r\nThe retroflex portion of the solubility curve of the hexahydrate extends to\r\nonly 1deg below the melting point of the hydrate. At 29.2deg crystals of a\r\nnew hydrate, [beta]-tetrahydrate, separate out, and the solution, which now\r\ncontains 112.8 parts of CaCl_{2} to 100 parts of water, is saturated with\r\nrespect to the two hydrates. Throughout its whole extent the solubility\r\ncurve EDF of the [beta]-tetrahydrate represents metastable equilibria. The\r\nupper limit of the solubility curve of [beta]-tetrahydrate is reached at\r\n38.4deg (F), the point of intersection with the curve for the dihydrate.\r\n\r\nAbove 29.8deg the stable hydrate is the [alpha]-tetrahydrate; and its\r\nsolubility curve extends to 45.3deg (K), at which temperature it cuts the\r\nsolubility curve of the dihydrate. The curve of the latter hydrate extends\r\nto 175.5deg (L), and is then succeeded by the curve for the monohydrate.\r\nThe solubility curve of the anhydrous salt does not begin until a\r\ntemperature of about 260deg. The whole diagram, therefore, shows a\r\nsuccession of stable hydrates, a metastable hydrate, a metastable melting\r\npoint and retroflex solubility curve. {150}\r\n\r\nPressure-Temperature Diagram.--The complete study of the equilibria between\r\nthe two components calcium chloride and water would require the discussion\r\nof the vapour pressure of the different systems, and its variation with the\r\ntemperature. For our present purpose, however, such a discussion would not\r\nbe of great value, and will therefore be omitted here; in general, the same\r\nrelationships would be found as in the case of sodium sulphate (p. 138),\r\nexcept that the rounded portion of the solubility curve of the hexahydrate\r\nwould be represented by a similar rounded portion in the pressure\r\ncurve.[227] As in the case of sodium sulphate, the transition points of the\r\ndifferent hydrates would be indicated by breaks in the curve of pressures.\r\nFinally, mention may again be made of the difference of the pressure of\r\ndissociation of the hexahydrate according as it becomes dehydrated to the\r\n[alpha]- or the [beta]-tetrahydrate (p. 88).\r\n\r\nThe Indifferent Point.--We have already seen that at 30.2deg calcium\r\nchloride hexahydrate melts congruently, and that, provided the pressure is\r\nmaintained constant, addition or withdrawal of heat will cause the complete\r\nliquefaction or solidification, without the temperature of the system\r\nundergoing change. This behaviour, therefore, is similar to, but is not\r\nquite the same as the fusion of a simple substance such as ice; and the\r\ndifference is due to the fact that in the case of the hexahydrate the\r\nemission of vapour by the liquid phase causes an alteration in the\r\ncomposition of the latter, owing to the non-volatility of the calcium\r\nchloride; whereas in the case of ice this is, of course, not so.\r\n\r\nConsider, however, for the present that the vapour phase is absent, and\r\nthat we are dealing with the two-phase system solid--solution. Then, since\r\nthere are two components, the system is bivariant. For any given value of\r\nthe pressure, therefore, we should expect that the system could exist at\r\ndifferent temperatures; which, indeed, is the case. It has, however,\r\nalready been noted that when the composition of the liquid phase becomes\r\nthe same as that of the solid, the system then behaves as a _univariant_\r\nsystem; for, at a given pressure, the system solid--solution can exist only\r\nat _one_ temperature, change of temperature producing complete\r\ntransformation in {151} one or other direction. _The variability of the\r\nsystem has therefore been diminished._\r\n\r\nThis behaviour will perhaps be more clearly understood when one reflects\r\nthat since the composition of the two phases is the same, the system may be\r\nregarded as being formed of _one component_, just as the system NH_{4}Cl\r\n<--> NH_{3} + HCl was regarded as being composed of one component when the\r\nvapour had the same total composition as the solid (p. 13). One component\r\nin two phases, however, constitutes a univariant system, and we can\r\ntherefore see that calcium chloride hexahydrate in contact with solution of\r\nthe same composition will constitute a univariant system. The temperature\r\nof equilibrium will, however, vary with the pressure;[228] if the latter is\r\nconstant, the temperature will also be constant.\r\n\r\nA point such as has just been referred to, which represents the special\r\nbehaviour of a system of two (or more) components, in which the composition\r\nof two phases becomes identical, is known as an _indifferent point_,[229]\r\nand it has been shown[230] that at a given pressure the temperature in the\r\nindifferent point is the _maximum_ or _minimum_ temperature possible at the\r\nparticular pressure[231] (cf. critical solution temperature). At such a\r\npoint a system loses one degree of freedom, or behaves like a system of the\r\nnext lower order.\r\n\r\nThe Hydrates of Ferric Chloride.--A better illustration of the formation of\r\ncompounds possessing a definite melting point, and of the existence of\r\nretroflex solubility curves, is afforded by the hydrates of ferric\r\nchloride, which not only possess definite points of fusion, but these\r\nmelting points are stable. A very brief description of the relations met\r\nwith will suffice.[232]\r\n\r\n{152}\r\n\r\nFerric chloride can form no less than four stable hydrates, viz.\r\nFe_{2}Cl_{6},12H_{2}O, Fe_{2}Cl_{6},7H_{2}O, Fe_{2}Cl_{6},5H_{2}O, and\r\nFe_{2}Cl_{6},4H_{2}O, and each of these hydrates possesses a definite,\r\nstable melting point. On analogy with the behaviour of calcium chloride,\r\ntherefore, we shall expect that the solubility curves of these different\r\nhydrates will exhibit a series of _temperature maxima_; the points of\r\nmaximum temperature representing systems in which the composition of the\r\nsolid and liquid phases is the same. A graphical representation of the\r\nsolubility relations is given in Fig. 39, and the composition of the\r\ndifferent saturated solutions which can be formed is given in the following\r\ntables, the composition being expressed in molecules of Fe_{2}Cl_{6} to 100\r\nmolecules of water. The figures printed in thick type refer to transition\r\nand melting points.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 39.]\r\n\r\n{153}\r\n\r\n  COMPOSITION OF THE SATURATED SOLUTIONS OF FERRIC CHLORIDE AND ITS\r\n      HYDRATES.\r\n\r\n  (_The name placed at the head of each table is the solid phase._)\r\n\r\n  ICE.\r\n  ---------------------------\r\n  Temperature. | Composition.\r\n  ---------------------------\r\n  +/--55deg    |  +/-2.75\r\n     -40deg    |     2.37\r\n     -27.5deg  |     1.90\r\n     -20.5deg  |     1.64\r\n     -10deg    |     1.00\r\n       0deg    |     0\r\n  ---------------------------\r\n\r\n  Fe_{2}Cl_{6},12H_{2}O.\r\n  ---------------------------\r\n  Temperature. | Composition.\r\n  ---------------------------\r\n    -55deg     |  +/-2.75\r\n    -41deg     |     2.81\r\n    -27deg     |     2.98\r\n      0deg     |     4.13\r\n     10deg     |     4.54\r\n     20deg     |     5.10\r\n     30deg     |     5.93\r\n     35deg     |     6.78\r\n     36.5deg   |     7.93\r\n     37deg     |     8.33\r\n     36deg     |     9.29\r\n     33deg     |    10.45\r\n     30deg     |    11.20\r\n     27.4deg   |    12.15\r\n     20deg     |    12.83\r\n     10deg     |    13.20\r\n      8deg     |    13.70\r\n  ---------------------------\r\n\r\n  Fe_{2}Cl_{6},7H_{2}O.\r\n  ---------------------------\r\n  Temperature. | Composition.\r\n  ---------------------------\r\n     20deg     |    11.35\r\n     27.4deg   |    12.15\r\n     32deg     |    13.55\r\n     32.5deg   |    14.29\r\n     30deg     |    15.12\r\n     25deg     |    15.54\r\n  ---------------------------\r\n\r\n  Fe_{2}Cl_{6},5H_{2}O.\r\n  ---------------------------\r\n  Temperature. | Composition.\r\n  ---------------------------\r\n     20deg     |    11.35\r\n     12deg     |    12.87\r\n     20deg     |    13.95\r\n     27deg     |    14.85\r\n     30deg     |    15.12\r\n     35deg     |    15.64\r\n     50deg     |    17.50\r\n     55deg     |    19.15\r\n     56deg     |    20.00\r\n     55deg     |    20.32\r\n  ---------------------------\r\n\r\n  Fe_{2}Cl_{6},4H_{2}O\r\n  ---------------------------\r\n  Temperature. | Composition.\r\n  ---------------------------\r\n     20deg     |    11.35\r\n     50deg     |    19.96\r\n     55deg     |    20.32\r\n     60deg     |    20.70\r\n     69deg     |    21.53\r\n     72.5deg   |    23.35\r\n     73.5deg   |    25.00\r\n     72.5deg   |    26.15\r\n     70deg     |    27.90\r\n     66deg     |    29.20\r\n  ---------------------------\r\n\r\n  Fe_{2}Cl_{6} (ANHYDROUS).\r\n  ---------------------------\r\n  Temperature. | Composition.\r\n  ---------------------------\r\n     20deg     |    11.35\r\n     66deg     |    29.20\r\n     70deg     |    29.42\r\n     75deg     |    28.92\r\n     80deg     |    29.20\r\n    100deg     |    29.75\r\n  ---------------------------\r\n\r\nThe lowest portion of the curve, AB, represents the equilibria between ice\r\nand solutions containing ferric chloride. It represents, in other words,\r\nthe lowering of the fusion point of ice by addition of ferric chloride. At\r\nthe point B (-55deg), the cryohydric point (p. 117) is reached, at which\r\nthe solution is in equilibrium with ice and ferric chloride dodecahydrate.\r\nAs {154} has already been shown, such a point represents an invariant\r\nsystem; and the liquid phase will, therefore, solidify to a mixture of ice\r\nand hydrate without change of temperature. If heat is added, ice will melt\r\nand the system will pass to the curve BCDN, which is the solubility curve\r\nof the dodecahydrate. At C (37deg), the point of maximum temperature, the\r\nhydrate melts completely. The retroflex portion of this curve can be\r\nfollowed backwards to a temperature of 8deg, but below 27.4deg (D), the\r\nsolutions are supersaturated with respect to the heptahydrate; point D is\r\nthe eutectic point for dodecahydrate and heptahydrate. The curve DEF is the\r\nsolubility curve of the heptahydrate, E being the melting point, 32.5deg.\r\nOn further increasing the quantity of ferric chloride, the temperature of\r\nequilibrium is lowered until at F (30deg) another eutectic point is\r\nreached, at which the heptahydrate and pentahydrate can co-exist with\r\nsolution. Then follow the solubility curves for the pentahydrate, the\r\ntetrahydrate, and the anhydrous salt; G (56deg) is the melting point of the\r\nformer hydrate, J (73.5deg) the melting point of the latter. H and K, the\r\npoints at which the curves intersect, represent eutectic points; the\r\ntemperature of the former is 55deg, that of the latter 66deg. The dotted\r\nportions of the curves represent metastable equilibria.\r\n\r\nAs is seen from the diagram, a remarkable series of solubility curves is\r\nobtained, each passing through a point of maximum temperature, the whole\r\nseries of curves forming an undulating \"festoon.\" To the right of the\r\nseries of curves the diagram represents unsaturated solutions; to the left,\r\nsupersaturated.\r\n\r\nIf an unsaturated solution, the composition of which is represented by a\r\npoint in the field to the right of the solubility curves, is cooled down,\r\nthe result obtained will differ according as the composition of the\r\nsolution is the same as that of a cryohydric point, or of a melting point,\r\nor has an intermediate value. Thus, if a solution represented by _x__{1} is\r\ncooled down, the composition will remain unchanged as indicated by the\r\nhorizontal dotted line, until the point D is reached. At this point,\r\ndodecahydrate and heptahydrate will separate out, and the liquid will\r\nultimately solidify completely to a mixture or \"conglomerate\" of these two\r\nhydrates; the temperature of {155} the system remaining constant until\r\ncomplete solidification has taken place. If, on the other hand, a solution\r\nof the composition _x__{3} is cooled down, ferric chloride dodecahydrate\r\nwill be formed when the temperature has fallen to that represented by C,\r\nand the solution will completely solidify, without alteration of\r\ntemperature, with formation of this hydrate. In both these cases,\r\ntherefore, a point is reached at which complete solidification occurs\r\nwithout change of temperature.\r\n\r\nSomewhat different, however, is the result when the solution has an\r\nintermediate composition, as represented by _x__{2} or _x__{4}. In the\r\nformer case the dodecahydrate will first of all separate out, but on\r\nfurther withdrawal of heat the temperature will fall, the solution will\r\nbecome relatively richer in ferric chloride, owing to separation of the\r\nhydrate, and ultimately the eutectic point D will be reached, at which\r\ncomplete solidification will occur. Similarly with the second solution.\r\nFerric chloride dodecahydrate will first be formed, and the temperature\r\nwill gradually fall, the composition of the solution following the curve CB\r\nuntil the cryohydric point B is reached, when the whole will solidify to a\r\nconglomerate of ice and dodecahydrate.\r\n\r\nSuspended Transformation.--Not only can the upper branch of the solubility\r\ncurve of the dodecahydrate be followed backwards to a temperature of 8deg,\r\nor about 19deg below the temperature of transition to the heptahydrate; but\r\nsuspended transformation has also been observed in the case of the\r\nheptahydrate and the pentahydrate. To such an extent is this the case that\r\nthe solubility curve of the latter hydrate has been followed downwards to\r\nits point of intersection with the curve for the dodecahydrate. This point\r\nof intersection, represented in Fig. 39 by M, lies at a temperature of\r\nabout 15deg; and at this temperature, therefore, it is possible for the two\r\nsolid phases dodecahydrate and pentahydrate to coexist, so that M is a\r\neutectic point for the dodecahydrate and the pentahydrate. It is, however,\r\na metastable eutectic point, for it lies in the region of supersaturation\r\nwith respect to the heptahydrate; and it can be realized only because of\r\nthe fact that the latter hydrate is not readily formed.\r\n\r\nEvaporation of Solutions at Constant Temperature.--On {156} evaporating\r\ndilute solutions of ferric chloride at constant temperature, a remarkable\r\nseries of changes is observed, which, however, will be understood with the\r\nhelp of Fig. 40. Suppose an unsaturated solution, the composition of which\r\nis represented by the point _x__{1}, is evaporated at a temperature of\r\nabout 17deg - 18deg. As water passes off, the composition of the solution\r\nwill follow the dotted line of constant temperature, until at the point\r\nwhere it cuts the curve BC the solid hydrate Fe_{2}Cl_{6},12H_{2}O\r\nseparates out. As water continues to be removed, the hydrate must be\r\ndeposited (in order that the solution shall remain saturated), until\r\nfinally the solution dries up to the hydrate. As dehydration proceeds, the\r\nheptahydrate can be formed, and the dodecahydrate will finally pass into\r\nthe heptahydrate; and this, in turn, into the pentahydrate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 40.]\r\n\r\nBut the heptahydrate is not always formed by the dehydration of the\r\ndodecahydrate, and the behaviour on evaporation is therefore somewhat\r\nperplexing at first sight. After the solution has dried to the\r\ndodecahydrate, as explained above, further removal of water causes\r\nliquefaction, and the system is now represented by the point of\r\nintersection at _a_; at this point the solid hydrate is in equilibrium with\r\na solution containing relatively more ferric chloride. If, therefore,\r\nevaporation is continued, the solid hydrate must _pass into solution_ in\r\norder that the composition of the latter may remain unchanged, so that\r\nultimately a liquid will again be obtained. A very slight further\r\ndehydration will bring the solution into the state represented by _b_, at\r\nwhich the pentahydrate is formed, and the solution will at last disappear\r\nand leave this hydrate alone.\r\n\r\nWithout the information to be obtained from the curves in Figs. 39 and 40,\r\nthe phenomena which would be observed on carrying out the evaporation at a\r\ntemperature of about 31 - 32deg {157} would be still more bewildering. The\r\ncomposition of the different solutions formed will be represented by the\r\nperpendicular line _x__{2}12345. Evaporation will first cause the\r\nseparation of the dodecahydrate, and then total disappearance of the liquid\r\nphase. Then liquefaction will occur, and the system will now be represented\r\nby the point 2, in which condition it will remain until the solid hydrate\r\nhas disappeared. Following this there will be deposition of the\r\nheptahydrate (point 3), with subsequent disappearance of the liquid phase.\r\nFurther dehydration will again cause liquefaction, when the concentration\r\nof the solution will be represented by the point 4; the heptahydrate will\r\nultimately disappear, and then will ensue the deposition of the\r\npentahydrate, and complete solidification will result. On evaporating a\r\nsolution, therefore, of the composition _x__{2}, the following series of\r\nphenomena will be observed: solidification to dodecahydrate; liquefaction;\r\nsolidification to heptahydrate; liquefaction; solidification to\r\npentahydrate.[233]\r\n\r\nAlthough ferric chloride and water form the largest and best-studied series\r\nof hydrates possessing definite melting points, examples of similar\r\nhydrates are not few in number; and more careful investigation is\r\nconstantly adding to the list.[234] In all these cases the solubility curve\r\nwill show a point of maximum temperature, at which the hydrate melts, and\r\nwill end, above and below, in a cryohydric point. Conversely, if such a\r\ncurve is found in a system of two components, we can argue that a definite\r\ncompound of the components possessing a definite melting point is formed.\r\n\r\nInevaporable Solutions.--If a saturated solution in contact with two\r\nhydrates, or with a hydrate and anhydrous salt is heated, the temperature\r\nand composition of the solution will, of course, remain unchanged so long\r\nas the two solid phases are present, for such a system is invariant. In\r\naddition to this, however, the _quantity_ of the solution will also remain\r\nunchanged, the water which evaporates being supplied by the higher hydrate.\r\nThe same phenomenon is also observed in the case of cryohydric points when\r\nice is a solid phase; so long as the latter is present, evaporation will be\r\naccompanied {158} by fusion of the ice, and the quantity of solution will\r\nremain constant. Such solutions are called _inevaporable_.[235]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 41.]\r\n\r\nIllustration.--In order to illustrate the application of the principles of\r\nthe Phase Rule to the study of systems formed by a volatile and a\r\nnon-volatile component, a brief description may be given of the behaviour\r\nof sulphur dioxide and potassium iodide, which has formed the subject of a\r\nrecent investigation. After it had been found[236] that liquid sulphur\r\ndioxide has the property of dissolving potassium iodide, and that the\r\nsolutions thus obtained present certain peculiarities of behaviour, the\r\nquestion arose as to whether or not compounds are formed between the\r\nsulphur dioxide and the potassium iodide, and if so, what these compounds\r\nare. To find an answer to this question, Walden and Centnerszwer[237] made\r\na complete investigation of the solubility curves (equilibrium curves) of\r\nthese two components, the investigation extending from the freezing point\r\nto the critical point of sulphur dioxide. For convenience of reference, the\r\nresults which they obtained are represented diagrammatically in Fig. 41.\r\nThe freezing point (A) of pure sulphur dioxide was found to be -72.7deg.\r\nAddition of potassium iodide lowered the freezing point, but the maximum\r\ndepression obtained was very small, and was reached when the concentration\r\nof the potassium iodide in the solution was only 0.336 mols. per cent.\r\nBeyond this point, an increase in the concentration of the iodide was\r\naccompanied by an elevation of the freezing point, the change of the\r\nfreezing point with the concentration being represented by the curve BC.\r\nThe solid {159} which separated from the solutions represented by BC was a\r\nbright _yellow_ crystalline substance. At the point C (-23.4deg) a\r\ntemperature-maximum was reached; and as the concentration of the potassium\r\niodide was continuously increased, the temperature of equilibrium first\r\nfell and then slowly rose, until at +0.26deg (E) a second\r\ntemperature-maximum was registered. On passing the point D, the solid which\r\nwas deposited from the solution was a _red_ crystalline substance. On\r\nwithdrawing sulphur dioxide from the system, the solution became turbid,\r\nand the temperature remained constant. The investigation was not pursued\r\nfarther at this point, the attention being then directed to the equilibria\r\nat higher temperatures.\r\n\r\nWhen a solution of potassium iodide in liquid sulphur dioxide containing\r\n1.49 per cent. of potassium iodide was heated, solid (potassium iodide) was\r\ndeposited at a temperature of 96.4deg. Solutions containing more than about\r\n3 per cent. of the iodide separated, on being heated, into two layers, and\r\nthe temperature at which the liquid became heterogeneous fell as the\r\nconcentration was increased; a temperature-minimum being obtained with\r\nsolutions containing 12 per cent. of potassium iodide. On the other hand,\r\nsolutions containing 30.9 per cent. of the iodide, on being heated,\r\ndeposited potassium iodide; while a solution containing 24.5 per cent. of\r\nthe salt first separated into two layers at 89.3deg, and then, on cooling,\r\nsolid was deposited and one of the liquid layers disappeared.\r\n\r\nSuch are, in brief, the results of experiment; their interpretation in the\r\nlight of the Phase Rule is the following:--\r\n\r\nThe curve AB is the freezing-point curve of solid sulphur dioxide in\r\ncontact with solutions of potassium iodide. BCD is the solubility curve of\r\nthe yellow crystalline solid which is deposited from the solutions. C, the\r\ntemperature-maximum, is the melting point of this _yellow_ solid, and the\r\ncomposition of the latter must be the same as that of the solution at this\r\npoint (p. 145), which was found to be that represented by the formula\r\nKI,14SO_{2}. B is therefore the eutectic point, at which solid sulphur\r\ndioxide and the compound KI,14SO_{2} can exist together in equilibrium with\r\nsolution and vapour. The curve DE is the solubility curve of the _red_\r\ncrystalline solid, and the {160} point E, at which the composition of\r\nsolution and solid is the same, is the melting point of the solid. The\r\ncomposition of this substance was found to be KI,4SO_{2}.[238] D is,\r\ntherefore, the eutectic point at which the compounds KI,14SO_{2} and\r\nKI,4SO_{2} can coexist in equilibrium with solution and vapour. The curve\r\nDE does not exhibit a retroflex portion; on the contrary, on attempting to\r\nobtain more concentrated solutions in equilibrium with the compound\r\nKI,4SO_{2}, a new solid phase (probably potassium iodide) was formed. Since\r\nat this point there are four phases in equilibrium, viz. the compound\r\nKI,4SO_{2}, potassium iodide, solution, and vapour, the system is\r\ninvariant. E is, therefore, the _transition point_ for KI,4SO_{2} and KI.\r\n\r\nPassing to higher temperatures, FG is the solubility curve of potassium\r\niodide in sulphur dioxide; at G two liquid phases are formed, and the\r\nsystem therefore becomes invariant (cf. p. 121). The curve GHK is the\r\nsolubility curve for two partially miscible liquids; and since complete\r\nmiscibility occurs on _lowering_ the temperature, the curve is similar to\r\nthat obtained with triethylamine and water (p. 101). K is also an invariant\r\npoint at which potassium iodide is in equilibrium with two liquid phases\r\nand vapour.\r\n\r\nThe complete investigation of the equilibria between sulphur dioxide and\r\npotassium iodide, therefore, shows that these two components form the\r\ncompounds KI,14SO_{2} and KI,4SO_{2}; and that when solutions having a\r\nconcentration between those represented by the points G and K are heated,\r\nseparation into two layers occurs. The temperatures and concentrations of\r\nthe different characteristic points are as follows:--\r\n\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------\r\n                              |                | Composition of\r\n              Point.          |  Temperature.  |  the solution\r\n                              |                |  per cent.

As we shall see, however, the removal of the\r\nprevious restriction produces no alteration in the general aspect of the\r\nequilibrium curves for concentration and temperature, but changes to some\r\nextent the appearance of the pressure-temperature diagram. The latter would\r\nbecome still more complicated if account were taken not only of the total\r\npressure but also of the partial pressures of the two components in the\r\nvapour phase; this complication, however, will not be introduced in the\r\npresent discussion.[240] In this chapter we shall consider the systems\r\nformed by the two components iodine and chlorine, and sulphur dioxide and\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nIodine and Chlorine.--The different systems furnished by iodine and\r\nchlorine, rendered classical by the studies of Stortenbeker,[241] form a\r\nvery complete example of equilibria in a two-component system. We shall\r\nfirst of all consider the {162} relations between concentration and\r\ntemperature, with the help of the accompanying diagram, Fig. 42.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 42.]\r\n\r\nConcentration-Temperature Diagram.--In this diagram the temperatures are\r\ntaken as the abscissae, and the composition of the solution, expressed in\r\natoms of chlorine to one atom of iodine,[242] is represented by the\r\nordinates. In the diagram, A represents the melting point of pure iodine,\r\n114deg. If chlorine is added to the system, a solution of chlorine in\r\nliquid iodine is obtained, and the temperature at which solid iodine is in\r\nequilibrium with the liquid solution will be all the lower the greater the\r\nconcentration of the chlorine. We therefore obtain the curve ABF, which\r\nrepresents the composition of the solution {163} with which solid iodine is\r\nin equilibrium at different temperatures. This curve can be followed down\r\nto 0deg, but at temperatures below 7.9deg (B) it represents metastable\r\nequilibria. At B iodine monochloride can be formed, and if present the\r\nsystem becomes invariant; B is therefore a quadruple point at which the\r\nfour phases, iodine, iodine monochloride, solution, and vapour, can\r\ncoexist. Continued withdrawal of heat at this point will therefore lead to\r\nthe complete solidification of the solution to a mixture or conglomerate of\r\niodine and iodine monochloride, while the temperature remains constant\r\nduring the process. B is the eutectic point for iodine and iodine\r\nmonochloride.\r\n\r\nJust as we found in the case of aqueous salt solutions that at temperatures\r\nabove the cryohydric or eutectic point, two different solutions could\r\nexist, one in equilibrium with ice, the other in equilibrium with the salt\r\n(or salt hydrate), so in the case of iodine and chlorine there can be two\r\nsolutions above the eutectic point B, one containing a lower proportion of\r\nchlorine in equilibrium with iodine, the other containing a higher\r\nproportion of chlorine in equilibrium with iodine monochloride. The\r\ncomposition of the latter solution is represented by the curve BCD. As the\r\nconcentration of chlorine is increased, the temperature at which there is\r\nequilibrium between iodine monochloride and solution rises until a point is\r\nreached at which the composition of the solution is the same as that of the\r\nsolid. At this point (C), iodine monochloride melts. Addition of one of the\r\ncomponents will lower the temperature of fusion, and a continuous\r\ncurve,[243] exhibiting a retroflex portion as in the case of\r\nCaCl_{2},6H_{2}O, will be obtained. At temperatures below its melting\r\npoint, therefore, iodine monochloride can be in equilibrium with two\r\ndifferent solutions.\r\n\r\nThe upper portion of this curve, CD, can be followed downwards to a\r\ntemperature of 22.7deg. At this temperature iodine trichloride can separate\r\nout, and a second quadruple {164} point (D) is obtained. This is the\r\neutectic point for iodine monochloride and iodine trichloride.\r\n\r\nBy addition of heat and increase in the amount of chlorine, the iodine\r\nmonochloride disappears, and the system passes along the curve DE, which\r\nrepresents the composition of the solutions in equilibrium with solid\r\niodine trichloride. The concentration of chlorine in the solution increases\r\nas the temperature is raised, until at the point E, where the solution has\r\nthe same composition as the solid, the maximum temperature is reached; the\r\niodine trichloride melts. On increasing still further the concentration of\r\nchlorine in the solution, the temperature of equilibrium falls, and a\r\ncontinuous curve, similar to that for the monochloride, is obtained. The\r\nupper branch of this curve has been followed down to a temperature of\r\n30deg, the solution at this point containing 99.6 per cent. of\r\nchlorine.[244] The very rounded form of the curve is due to the trichloride\r\nbeing largely dissociated in the liquid state.\r\n\r\nOne curve still remains to be considered. As has already been mentioned,\r\niodine monochloride can exist in two crystalline forms, only one of which,\r\nhowever, is stable at temperatures below the melting point; the two forms\r\nare _monotropic_ (p. 44). The stable form which melts at 27.2deg, is called\r\nthe [alpha]-form, while the less stable variety, melting at 13.9deg, is\r\nknown as the [beta]-form. If, now, the presence of [alpha]-ICl is excluded,\r\nit is possible to obtain the [beta]-form, and to study the conditions of\r\nequilibrium between it and solutions of iodine and chlorine, from the\r\neutectic point F to the melting point G. As the [beta]-ICl becomes less\r\nstable in presence of excess of chlorine, it has not been possible to study\r\nthe retroflex portion of the curve represented by the dotted continuation\r\nof FG.\r\n\r\nThe following table gives some of the numerical data from which Fig. 42 was\r\nconstructed.[245]\r\n\r\n{165}\r\n\r\n  IODINE AND CHLORINE.\r\n\r\n  I. _Invariant systems._\r\n\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n          |          |                  Phases present.\r\n   Temper-| Pressure.+--------------------+-----------------+--------------\r\n   ature. |          |      Solid.        |    Liquid.      |   Vapour.\r\n  --------+----------+--------------------+-----------------+--------------\r\n  7.9deg  | 11 mm.   | I_{2},[alpha]-ICl  | I[wavy]Cl_{0.66}| I + Cl_{0.92}\r\n  0.9deg  |   --     | I_{2},[beta]-ICl   | I[wavy]Cl_{0.72}|     --\r\n  22.7deg | 42 mm.   | [alpha]-ICl,ICl_{3}| I[wavy]Cl_{1.19}| I + Cl_{1.75}\r\n  [-102deg| <1 atm.  | ICl_{3},Cl_{2}     | I[wavy]Cl_{m}   | I + Cl_{n}]\r\n  --------+----------+--------------------+-----------------+--------------\r\n\r\n  II. _Melting points._\r\n\r\n  A.

[beta]-Iodine monochloride, 13.9deg.\r\n\r\nSince the vapour pressure at the melting point of iodine trichloride\r\namounts to 16 atm., the experiments must of course be carried out\r\nin closed vessels. At 63.7deg the vapour pressure of the system\r\ntrichloride--solution--vapour is equal to 1 atm.\r\n\r\nPressure-Temperature Diagram.--In this diagram there are represented the\r\nvalues of the vapour pressure of the saturated solutions of chlorine and\r\niodine. To give a complete picture of the relations between pressure,\r\ntemperature, and concentration, a solid model would be required, with three\r\naxes at right angles to one another along which could be measured the\r\nvalues of pressure, temperature, and concentration of the components in the\r\nsolution. Instead of this, however, there may be employed the accompanying\r\nprojection figure[247] (Fig. 43), the lower portion of which shows the\r\nprojection of the equilibrium curve on the surface containing the\r\nconcentration and temperature axes, while the upper portion is the\r\nprojection on the plane containing the pressure and temperature axes. The\r\nlower portion is therefore a concentration-temperature diagram; {166} the\r\nupper portion, a pressure-temperature diagram. The corresponding points of\r\nthe two diagrams are joined by dotted lines.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 43.]\r\n\r\nCorresponding to the point C, the melting point of pure iodine, there is\r\nthe point C_{1}, which represents the vapour pressure of iodine at its\r\nmelting point. At this point three curves cut: 1, the sublimation curve of\r\niodine; 2, the vaporization curve of fused iodine; 3, C_{1}B_{1}, the\r\nvapour-pressure curve of the saturated solutions in equilibrium with solid\r\niodine. Starting, therefore, with the system solid iodine--liquid iodine,\r\naddition of chlorine will cause the temperature of equilibrium to fall\r\ncontinuously, while the vapour pressure will first increase, pass through a\r\nmaximum and then fall continuously {167} until the eutectic point, B\r\n(B_{1}), is reached.[248] At this point the system is invariant, and the\r\npressure will therefore remain constant until all the iodine has\r\ndisappeared. As the concentration of the chlorine increases in the manner\r\nrepresented by the curve B_f_H, the pressure of the vapour also increases\r\nas represented by the curve B_{1}_f__{1}H_{1}. At H_{1}, the eutectic point\r\nfor iodine monochloride and iodine trichloride, the pressure again remains\r\nconstant until all the monochloride has disappeared. As the concentration\r\nof the solution passes along the curve HF, the pressure of the vapour\r\nincreases as represented by the curve H_{1}F_{1}; F_{1} represents the\r\npressure of the vapour at the melting point of iodine trichloride. If the\r\nconcentration of the chlorine in the solution is continuously increased\r\nfrom this point, the vapour pressure first increases and then decreases,\r\nuntil the eutectic point for iodine trichloride and solid chlorine is\r\nreached (D_{1}). Curves Cl_{2} solid and Cl_{2} liquid represent the\r\nsublimation and vaporization curves of chlorine, the melting point of\r\nchlorine being -102deg.\r\n\r\nAlthough complete measurements of the vapour pressure of the different\r\nsystems of pure iodine to pure chlorine have not been made, the\r\nexperimental data are nevertheless sufficient to allow of the general form\r\nof the curves being indicated with certainty.\r\n\r\nBivariant Systems.--To these, only a brief reference need be made. Since\r\nthere are two components, two phases will form a bivariant system. The\r\nfields in which these systems can exist are shown in Fig. 43 and Fig. 44,\r\nwhich is a more diagrammatic representation of a portion of Fig. 43.\r\n\r\n    I. Iodine--vapour.\r\n   II. Solution--vapour.\r\n  III. Iodine trichloride--vapour.\r\n  IV. Iodine monochloride--vapour.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 44.]\r\n\r\nThe conditions for the existence of these systems will probably be best\r\nunderstood from Fig. 44. Since the curve B'A' {168} represents the\r\npressures under which the system iodine--solution--vapour can exist,\r\nincrease of volume (diminution of pressure) will cause the volatilization\r\nof the solution, and the system iodine--vapour will remain. If, therefore,\r\nwe start with a system represented by _a_, diminution of pressure at\r\nconstant temperature will lead to the condition represented by _x_. On the\r\nother hand, increase of pressure at _a_ will lead to the condensation of a\r\nportion of the vapour phase. Since, now, the concentration of chlorine in\r\nthe vapour is greater than in the solution, condensation of vapour would\r\nincrease the concentration of chlorine in the solution; a certain amount of\r\niodine must therefore pass into solution in order that the composition of\r\nthe latter shall remain unchanged.[249] If, therefore, the volume of vapour\r\nbe sufficiently great, continued diminution of volume will ultimately lead\r\nto the disappearance of all the iodine, and there will remain only solution\r\nand vapour (field II.). As the diminution of volume is continued, the\r\nvapour pressure and the concentration of the chlorine in the solution will\r\nincrease, until when the pressure has reached the value _b_, iodine\r\nmonochloride can separate out. The system, therefore, again becomes\r\nunivariant, and at constant temperature the pressure and composition of the\r\nphases must remain unchanged. Diminution of volume will therefore not\r\neffect an increase of pressure, but a condensation of the vapour; and since\r\nthis is richer in chlorine than the {169} solution, solid iodine\r\nmonochloride must separate out in order that the concentration of the\r\nsolution remain unchanged.[250] As the result, therefore, we obtain the\r\nbivariant system iodine monochloride--vapour.\r\n\r\nA detailed discussion of the effect of a continued increase of pressure\r\nwill not be necessary. From what has already been said and with the help of\r\nFig. 44, it will readily be understood that this will lead successively to\r\nthe univariant system (_c_), iodine monochloride--solution--vapour; the\r\nbivariant system solution--vapour (field II.); the univariant system (_d_),\r\niodine trichloride--solution--vapour; and the bivariant system _x'_, iodine\r\ntrichloride--vapour. If the temperature of the experiment is above the\r\nmelting point of the monochloride, then the systems in which this compound\r\noccurs will not be formed.\r\n\r\nSulphur Dioxide and Water.--In the case just studied we have seen that the\r\ncomponents can combine to form definite compounds possessing stable melting\r\npoints. The curves of equilibrium, therefore, resemble in their general\r\naspect those of calcium chloride and water, or of ferric chloride and\r\nwater. In the case of sulphur dioxide and water, however, the melting point\r\nof the compound formed cannot be realized, because transition to another\r\nsystem occurs; retroflex concentration-temperature curves are therefore not\r\nfound here, but the curves exhibit breaks or sudden changes in direction at\r\nthe transition points, as in the case of the systems formed by sodium\r\nsulphate and water. The case of sulphur dioxide and water is also of\r\ninterest from the fact that two liquid phases can be formed.\r\n\r\nThe phases which occur are--Solid: ice, sulphur dioxide hydrate,\r\nSO_{2},7H_{2}O. Liquid: two solutions, the one containing excess of sulphur\r\ndioxide, the other excess of water, and represented by the symbols SO_{2}\r\n[wavy] _x_H_{2}O (solution I.), and H_{2}O [wavy] _y_SO_{2} (solution II.).\r\nVapour: a mixture of sulphur dioxide and water vapour in varying\r\nproportions. Since there are two components, sulphur dioxide and water, the\r\nnumber of {170} possible systems is considerable. Only the following,\r\nhowever, have been studied:--\r\n\r\n  I. _Invariant Systems: Four co-existing phases._\r\n    (_a_) Ice, hydrate, solution, vapour.\r\n    (_b_) Hydrate, solution I., solution II., vapour.\r\n\r\n  II. _Univariant Systems: Three co-existing phases._\r\n    (_a_) Hydrate, solution I., vapour.\r\n    (_b_) Hydrate, solution II., vapour.\r\n    (_c_) Solution I., solution II., vapour.\r\n    (_d_) Hydrate, solution I., solution II.\r\n    (_e_) Hydrate, ice, vapour.\r\n    (_f_) Ice, solution II., vapour.\r\n    (_g_) Ice, hydrate, solution II.\r\n\r\n  III. _Bivariant Systems: Two co-existing phases._\r\n    (_a_) Hydrate, solution I.\r\n    (_b_) Hydrate, solution II.\r\n    (_c_) Hydrate, vapour.\r\n    (_d_) Hydrate, ice.\r\n    (_e_) Solution I., solution II.\r\n    (_f_) Solution I., vapour.\r\n    (_g_) Solution I., ice.\r\n    (_h_) Solution II., vapour.\r\n    (_i_) Solution II., ice.\r\n    (_j_) Ice, vapour.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 45.]\r\n\r\nPressure-Temperature Diagram.[251]--If sulphur dioxide is passed into water\r\nat 0deg, a solution will be formed and the temperature at which ice can\r\nexist in equilibrium with this solution will fall more and more as the\r\nconcentration of the sulphur dioxide increases. At -2.6deg, however, a\r\ncryohydric point is reached at which solid hydrate separates out,\r\nand the system becomes invariant. The curve AB (Fig. 45) therefore\r\nrepresents the pressure of the system ice--solution II.--vapour, and B\r\nrepresents the temperature and pressure at which the invariant system\r\nice--hydrate--solution II.--vapour can exist. At this point the temperature\r\nis -2.6deg, and the pressure 21.1 cm. If heat is withdrawn from this\r\nsystem, the solution will ultimately {171} solidify to a mixture of\r\nice and hydrate, and there will be obtained the univariant system\r\nice--hydrate--vapour. The vapour pressure of this system has been\r\ndetermined down to a temperature of -9.5deg, at which temperature the\r\npressure amounts to 15 cm. The pressures for this system are represented by\r\nthe curve BC. If at the point B the volume is diminished, the pressure must\r\nremain constant, but the relative amounts of the different phases will\r\nundergo change. If suitable quantities of these are present, diminution of\r\nvolume will ultimately lead to the total condensation of the vapour phase,\r\nand there will remain the univariant system ice--hydrate--solution. The\r\ntemperature of equilibrium of this system will alter with the pressure,\r\nbut, as in the case of the melting point of a simple substance, great\r\ndifferences of pressure will cause only comparatively small changes in the\r\ntemperature of equilibrium. The change of the cryohydric point with the\r\npressure is represented by the line BE; the actual values have not been\r\ndetermined, but the curve must slope towards the pressure axis because\r\nfusion is accompanied by diminution of volume, as in the case of pure ice.\r\n{172}\r\n\r\nA fourth univariant system can be formed at B. This is the system\r\nhydrate--solution II.--vapour. The conditions for the existence of\r\nthis system are represented by the curve BF, which may therefore be\r\nregarded as the vapour-pressure curve of the saturated solution of\r\nsulphur dioxide heptahydrate in water. Unlike the curve for iodine\r\ntrichloride--solution--vapour, this curve cannot be followed to the melting\r\npoint of the hydrate. Before this point is reached, a second liquid phase\r\nappears, and an invariant system consisting of hydrate--solution\r\nI.--solution II.--vapour is formed. We have here, therefore, the phenomenon\r\nof melting under the solution as in the case of succinic nitrile and water\r\n(p. 122). This point is represented in the diagram by F; the temperature at\r\nthis point is 12.1deg, and the pressure 177.3 cm. The range of stable\r\nexistence of the hydrate is therefore from -2.6deg to 12.1deg;\r\nnevertheless, the curve FB has been followed down to a temperature of\r\n-6deg, at which point ice formed spontaneously.\r\n\r\nSo long as the four phases hydrate, two liquid phases, and vapour are\r\npresent, the condition of the system is perfectly defined. By altering the\r\nconditions, however, one of the phases can be made to disappear, and a\r\nunivariant system will then be obtained. Thus, if the vapour phase is made\r\nto disappear, the univariant system solution I.--solution II.--hydrate,\r\nwill be left, and the temperature at which this system is in equilibrium\r\nwill vary with the pressure. This is represented by the curve FI; under a\r\npressure of 225 atm. the temperature of equilibrium is 17.1deg. Increase of\r\npressure, therefore, raises the temperature at which the three phases can\r\ncoexist.\r\n\r\nAgain, addition of heat to the invariant system at F will cause the\r\ndisappearance of the solid phase, and there will be formed the univariant\r\nsystem solution I.--solution II.--vapour. In the case of this system the\r\nvapour pressure increases as the temperature rises, as represented by the\r\ncurve FG. Such a system is analogous to the case of ether and water, or\r\nother two partially miscible liquids (p. 103). As the temperature changes,\r\nthe composition of the two liquid phases will undergo change; but this\r\nsystem has not been studied fully.\r\n\r\nThe fourth curve, which ends at the quadruple point F, is {173} that\r\nrepresenting the vapour pressure of the system hydrate--solution I.--vapour\r\n(FH). This curve has been followed to a temperature of 0deg, the pressure\r\nat this point being 113 cm. The metastable prolongation of GF has also been\r\ndetermined. Although, theoretically, this curve must lie below FH, it was\r\nfound that the difference in the pressure for the two curves was within the\r\nerror of experiment.\r\n\r\nBivariant Systems.--The different bivariant systems, consisting of two\r\nphases, which can exist within the range of temperature and pressure\r\nincluded in Fig. 45, were given on p. 170. The conditions under which these\r\nsystems can exist are represented by the areas in the diagram, and the\r\nfields of the different bivariant systems are indicated by letters,\r\ncorresponding to the letters on p. 170. Just as in the case of\r\none-component systems (p. 29), we found that the field lying between any\r\ntwo curves gave the conditions of existence of that phase which was common\r\nto the two curves, so also in the case of two-component systems, a\r\nbivariant two-phase system occurs in the field enclosed[252] by the two\r\ncurves to which the two phases are common. As can be seen, the same\r\nbivariant system can occur in more than one field.\r\n\r\nAs is evident from Fig. 45, three different bivariant systems are capable\r\nof existing in the area HFI; which of these will be obtained will depend on\r\nthe relative masses of the different phases in the univariant or invariant\r\nsystem. Thus, starting with a system represented by a point on the curve\r\nHF, diminution of volume at constant temperature will cause the\r\ncondensation of a portion of the vapour, which is rich in sulphur dioxide;\r\nsince this would increase the concentration of sulphur dioxide in the\r\nsolution, it must be counteracted by the passage of a portion of the\r\nhydrate (which is relatively poor in sulphur dioxide) into the solution.\r\nIf, therefore, the amount of hydrate present is relatively very small, the\r\nfinal result of the compression will be the production of the system _f_,\r\nsolution I.--vapour. On the other hand, if the vapour is present in\r\nrelatively small amount, it will be the first phase to disappear, {174} and\r\nthe bivariant system _a_, hydrate--solution I., will be obtained. Finally,\r\nif we start with the invariant system at F, compression will cause the\r\ncondensation of vapour, while the composition of the two solutions will\r\nremain unchanged. When all the vapour has disappeared, the univariant\r\nsystem hydrate--solution I.--solution II. will be left. If, now, the\r\npressure is still further increased, while the temperature is kept below\r\n12deg, more and more hydrate must be formed at the expense of the two\r\nliquid phases (because 12deg is the lower limit for the coexistence of the\r\ntwo liquid phases), and if the amount of the solution I. (containing excess\r\nof sulphur dioxide) is relatively small, it will disappear before solution\r\nII., and there will be obtained the bivariant system hydrate--solution II.\r\n(bivariant system _b_).\r\n\r\nIn a similar manner, account can be taken of the formation of the other\r\nbivariant systems.\r\n\r\nA behaviour similar to that of sulphur dioxide and water is shown by\r\nchlorine and water and by bromine and water, although these have not been\r\nso fully studied.[253] In the case of hydrogen bromide and water, and of\r\nhydrogen chloride and water, a hydrate, viz. HBr,2H_{2}O and HCl,2H_{2}O,\r\nis formed which possesses a definite melting point, as in the case of\r\niodine trichloride. In these cases, therefore, a retroflex curve is\r\nobtained. Further, just as in the case of the chlorides of iodine the upper\r\nbranch of the retroflex curve ended in a eutectic point, so also in the\r\ncase of the hydrate HBr,2H_{2}O the upper branch of the curve ends in a\r\neutectic point at which the system dihydrate--monohydrate--solution--vapour\r\ncan exist. Before the melting point of the monohydrate is reached, two\r\nliquid phases are formed, as in the case of sulphur dioxide and water.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{175}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nSOLID SOLUTIONS. MIXED CRYSTALS\r\n\r\nGeneral.--With the conception of gaseous and liquid solutions, every one is\r\nfamiliar. Gases can mix in all proportions to form homogeneous solutions.\r\nGases can dissolve in or be \"absorbed\" by liquids; and solids, also, when\r\nbrought in contact with liquids, \"pass into solution\" and yield a\r\nhomogeneous liquid phase. On the other hand, the conception of a _solid\r\nsolution_ is one which in many cases is found more difficult to appreciate;\r\nand the existence and behaviour of solid solutions, in spite of their not\r\nuncommon occurrence and importance, are in general comparatively little\r\nknown.\r\n\r\nThe reason of this is to be found, to some extent, no doubt, in the fact\r\nthat the term \"solid solution\" was introduced at a comparatively recent\r\ndate,[254] but it is probably also due in some measure to a somewhat hazy\r\ncomprehension of the definition of the term \"solution\" itself. As has\r\nalready been said (p. 92), a solution is a homogeneous phase, the\r\ncomposition of which can vary continuously within certain limits; the\r\ndefinition involves, therefore, no condition as to the physical state of\r\nthe substances. Accordingly, solid solutions are homogeneous solid phases,\r\nthe composition of which can undergo continuous variation within certain\r\nlimits. Just as we saw that the range of variation of composition is more\r\nlimited in the case of liquids than in the case of gases, so also we find\r\nthat the limits of miscibility are in general still more restricted in the\r\ncase of solids. Examples of complete miscibility are, however, not unknown\r\neven in the case of solid substances.\r\n\r\nSolid solutions have long been known, although, of course, {176} they were\r\nnot defined as such. Thus, the phenomena of \"occlusion\" of gases by metals\r\nand other substances (occlusion of hydrogen by palladium; occlusion of\r\nhydrogen by iron) are due to the formation of solid solutions. The same is\r\nprobably also true of the phenomena of \"adsorption,\" as in the removal of\r\norganic colouring matter by charcoal, although, in this case, surface\r\ntension no doubt plays a considerable part.[255]\r\n\r\nAs examples of the solution of gases in solids there may be cited (in\r\naddition to the phenomena of occlusion already mentioned), the hydrated\r\nsilicates and the zeolites. During dehydration these crystalline substances\r\nremain clear and transparent, and the pressure of the water vapour which\r\nthey emit varies with the degree of hydration or the concentration of water\r\nin the mineral.[256] As examples of the solution of solids in solids we\r\nhave the cementation of iron by charcoal, the formation of glass, and the\r\ncrystallization together of isomorphous substances.\r\n\r\nAlthough we have here spoken of the glasses as \"solid solutions,\" it should\r\nbe mentioned that the term \"solid\" is used in its popular sense. Strictly\r\nspeaking, the glasses are to be regarded as supercooled liquids (see also\r\np. 53, footnote).\r\n\r\nIn discussing the equilibria in systems containing a solid solution, it is\r\nof essential importance to remember that a solid solution constitutes only\r\n_one_ phase, a phase of varying composition, as in the case of liquid\r\nsolutions.\r\n\r\nSolution of Gases in Solids.--Comparatively little work has been done in\r\nthis connection, the investigations being limited chiefly to the phenomena\r\nof occlusion or adsorption of gases by charcoal.[257] We shall, therefore,\r\nindicate only briefly {177} and in a general manner, the behaviour which\r\nthe Phase Rule enables us to foresee.[258]\r\n\r\nIn dealing with the systems formed by the two phases gas--solid, three\r\nchief cases call for mention:--\r\n\r\nI. _The gas is not absorbed by the solid, but when the pressure reaches a\r\ncertain value, combination of the two components can result._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 46.]\r\n\r\nThe graphic representation of such a system is shown in Fig. 46, the\r\nordinates being the pressures of the gas, and the abscissae the\r\nconcentrations of the gaseous component in the solid phase. Since there is\r\nno formation of a solid solution, the concentration of gas in the solid\r\nphase remains zero until the pressure has increased to the point A. At this\r\npoint combination can take place. There will now be three phases present,\r\nviz. solid component, compound, and vapour. The system is therefore\r\nunivariant, and if the temperature is maintained constant, the vapour\r\npressure will be constant, irrespective of the amount of compound formed,\r\n_i.e._ irrespective of the relative amounts of gas and solid. This is\r\nindicated by the line AB. When the solid component has entirely\r\ndisappeared, the system ceases to be univariant, and if no absorption\r\noccurs, the pressure will increase again, as shown by BC. If a second\r\ncompound can be formed, then a second _pc_-line will be obtained, similar\r\nto the preceding. To this group belong the salt hydrates (Chap. VII.).\r\n\r\nII. _The gas may be absorbed and may also form a compound._\r\n\r\nIf absorption of gas occurs with formation of a solid solution, then, as\r\nthe system consists of two phases, solution--vapour, it is bivariant. At\r\nconstant temperature, therefore, the pressure will still vary with the\r\nconcentration of the gaseous component in the solid phase. This is\r\nrepresented by the curve AB in Fig. 47. When, however, the pressure has\r\nreached a certain value, combination can take place; and since there are\r\nnow three phases present, the system is {178} univariant, and at constant\r\ntemperature the pressure is constant, as shown by the line BC.\r\n\r\nIII. _Absorption of gas occurs, but at a certain concentration the solid\r\nsolution can separate into two immiscible solid solutions._\r\n\r\nWe have seen, in Chapter VI., that two liquids can form two immiscible\r\nsolutions, and the same has also been found true of solid solutions, as we\r\nshall presently learn more fully. If, now, two immiscible solutions are\r\nformed, then the system will become univariant, and at constant temperature\r\nthe _pc_-curve will be a straight line, as in the case of the formation of\r\na compound (cf. p. 86). The behaviour of this system will, therefore, also\r\nbe represented diagrammatically by Fig. 47.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 47.]\r\n\r\n_Palladium and Hydrogen._--The phenomenon of the absorption of hydrogen by\r\npalladium, to which Graham gave the name \"occlusion,\" is one that has\r\nclaimed the attention of several investigators. Although Graham was not of\r\nopinion that a compound is formed, but rather that the gas undergoes very\r\ngreat condensation, acts as a quasi-metal (to which he gave the name\r\nhydrogenium), and forms a homogeneous alloy with the palladium, later\r\ninvestigations, especially those of Troost and Hautefeuille,[259] pointed\r\nto the formation of a definite chemical compound, having the formula\r\nPd_{2}H. This conclusion has, however, not been confirmed by subsequent\r\ninvestigation.[260]\r\n\r\nRoozeboom and Hoitsema[261] sought to arrive at a final decision as to the\r\nnature of the phenomenon by an investigation of the equilibrium between\r\nhydrogen and palladium on the basis of the Phase Rule classification given\r\nabove. If a compound is formed, diminution of volume would cause no\r\nincrease of pressure, but only an increase in the amount of the compound.\r\n\r\nAs this is the only case of gas absorption which has been {179} accurately\r\nstudied from this point of view, a brief account of the results obtained\r\nwill be given here, although these are not so clear and free from ambiguity\r\nas one would desire.\r\n\r\nThe scientists just mentioned investigated the variation of the pressure of\r\nhydrogen with the amount absorbed by the metal at different temperatures,\r\nand a few of their results, typical of all, are represented graphically in\r\nFig. 48; the curves indicating the variation of the gas pressure with the\r\nconcentration of the hydrogen in the palladium at the temperatures 120deg,\r\n170deg, and 200deg. As can be seen, the curve consists of three parts, an\r\nascending portion which passes gradually and continuously into an almost\r\nhorizontal but slightly ascending middle part, which in turn passes without\r\nbreak into a second rapidly ascending curve. This, as Fig. 48 indicates, is\r\nthe general form of the curve; but the length of the middle portion varies\r\nwith the temperature, being shorter at higher than at lower temperatures.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 48.]\r\n\r\nWhat is the interpretation to be put on these curves? With regard to the\r\ntwo end portions, these represent bivariant, two-phase systems, consisting\r\nof a solid solution and gas. They correspond, therefore, to curve AB in\r\nFig. 47. If the middle portion were horizontal, it would indicate either\r\nthe formation of a compound or of two immiscible solid solutions. If a\r\ncompound Pd_{2}H were formed, then the middle portion would at all\r\ntemperatures end at the same value of the concentration, viz. that\r\ncorresponding to 0.5 atoms of hydrogen to 1 atom of palladium. As the\r\nfigure shows, however, this is not the case; the higher the temperature,\r\nthe lower is the concentration at which the middle passes into the terminal\r\nportion of the curve. {180} Such a behaviour would, however, agree with the\r\nassumption of the formation of two solid solutions, the \"miscibility\" of\r\nwhich increases with the temperature, as in the case of the liquid\r\nsolutions of phenol and water (p. 97). Nevertheless, although the\r\nassumption of the formation of two solid solutions is more satisfactory\r\nthan that of the formation of a compound, it does not entirely explain the\r\nfacts. If two solid solutions are formed, the pressure curve should be\r\nhorizontal, but this is not the case; and the deviation from the horizontal\r\ndoes not appear to be due to impurities either in the gas or in the metal,\r\nbut is apparently a peculiarity of the system. Further, the gradual instead\r\nof abrupt passage of the three portions of the curve into one another\r\nremains unexplained. Hoitsema has expressed the opinion that the occlusion\r\nof hydrogen by palladium is a process of continuous absorption, the\r\npeculiar form of the curve--the flat middle portion--being possibly due to\r\na condensation of the gas, even at temperatures far above the critical\r\ntemperature of liquid hydrogen.\r\n\r\nWhile, therefore, the occlusion of hydrogen by palladium still presents\r\nsome unexplained phenomena, the behaviour found by Hoitsema would appear to\r\ndisprove conclusively the formation of a definite chemical compound.[262]\r\n\r\nSOLUTION OF SOLIDS IN SOLIDS. MIXED CRYSTALS.\r\n\r\nThe introduction by van't Hoff of the term \"solid solution\" resulted from\r\nthe discovery of a number of deviations from the Raoult-van't Hoff law for\r\nthe depression of the freezing point by dissolved substances. In all cases,\r\nthe depression was too small; in some instances, indeed, the freezing point\r\nmay be raised. To explain these irregularities, van't Hoff assumed that the\r\ndissolved substance crystallized out along with the solid solvent; and he\r\nshowed how this would account for the {181} deviations from the law of the\r\ndepression of the freezing point, which had been developed on the\r\nassumption that only the pure solvent crystallized out from the\r\nsolution.[263]\r\n\r\nThe \"mixed crystals\" which were thus obtained, and which van't Hoff called\r\ndilute solid solutions, showed great resemblance in their behaviour to\r\nordinary liquid solutions, and obeyed the laws applicable to these. These\r\nlaws, however, can no longer be applied in the case of the concentrated\r\nsolid solutions formed by the crystallization together of isomorphous\r\nsubstances, and known as isomorphous mixtures. Indeed, it has been\r\ncontended[264] that these isomorphous mixtures should not be considered as\r\nsolid solutions at all, although no sharp line of demarcation can be drawn\r\nbetween the two classes. The differences, however, in the behaviour of the\r\ntwo groups are of a quantitative rather than a qualitative nature; and\r\nsince we are concerned at present only with the qualitative behaviour, we\r\nshall make no distinction between the crystalline solid solutions and the\r\nisomorphous mixtures, but shall study the behaviour of the two classes\r\nunder the head of \"mixed crystals.\"\r\n\r\nMixed crystals can be formed either by sublimation[265] or from a liquid\r\nphase; and in the latter case the mixed crystals can be deposited either\r\nfrom solution in a common solvent or from a mixture of the fused\r\ncomponents. In this method of formation, which alone will be discussed in\r\nthe present chapter, we are dealing with the fusion curves of two\r\nsubstances, where, however, the liquid solution is in equilibrium not with\r\none of the pure components, but with a solid solution or mixed crystal. The\r\nsimple scheme (Fig. 29, p. 117) which was obtained in the case of two\r\ncomponents which crystallize out in the pure state, is no longer sufficient\r\nin the case of the formation of mixed crystals. With the help of the Phase\r\nRule, however, the different possible systems can be classified; and\r\nexamples of the different cases predicted by the Phase Rule have also been\r\nobtained by experiment.\r\n\r\n{182}\r\n\r\nWe shall now consider briefly the formation of mixed crystals by\r\nisomorphous substances; the consideration of the formation of mixed\r\ncrystals of isodimorphous substances will, on account of the complexity of\r\nthe relationships, not be undertaken here.[266]\r\n\r\n_Formation of Mixed Crystals of Isomorphous Substances._\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of representing the relationships found here we shall\r\nemploy a temperature-concentration diagram,[267] in which the ordinates\r\nrepresent the temperature and the abscissae the concentration of the\r\ncomponents. Since there are two solutions, the liquid and the solid, and\r\nsince the concentration of the components in these two phases is not, in\r\ngeneral, the same, two curves will be required for each system, one\r\nrelating to the liquid phase, the other relating to the solid. The\r\ntemperature at which solid begins to be deposited from the liquid solution\r\nwill be called the _freezing point_ of the mixture, and the temperature at\r\nwhich the solid solution just begins to liquefy will be called the _melting\r\npoint_ of the solid solution. The temperature-concentration curve for the\r\nliquid phase will therefore be the freezing-point curve; that for the solid\r\nsolution, the melting-point curve. The latter will be represented by a\r\ndotted line.[268]\r\n\r\n{183}\r\n\r\nI.--THE TWO COMPONENTS CAN FORM AN UNBROKEN SERIES OF MIXED CRYSTALS.\r\n\r\nSince, as has already been pointed out (p. 176), a mixed crystal (solid\r\nsolution) constitutes only one phase, it is evident that if the two\r\ncomponents are miscible with one another in all proportions in the solid\r\nstate, there can never be more than one solid phase present, viz. the solid\r\nsolution or mixed crystal. If the components are completely miscible in the\r\nsolid state, they will also be completely miscible in the liquid state, and\r\nthere can therefore be only one liquid phase. The system can at no point\r\nbecome invariant, because there can never be more than three phases\r\npresent. When, therefore, the two components form a continuous series of\r\nmixed crystals, the equilibrium curve must also be continuous. Of these\r\nsystems three types are found.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 49.]\r\n\r\n(_a_) _The freezing points of all mixtures lie between the freezing points\r\nof the pure components_ (Curve I., Fig. 49).\r\n\r\nExamples.--This type of curve is represented by the mixed crystals of\r\nnaphthalene and [beta]-naphthol.[269] The addition of [beta]-naphthol to\r\nnaphthalene raises the freezing point of the latter, and the rise is\r\ndirectly proportional to the amount of naphthol added. The freezing point\r\ncurve is therefore a straight line joining the melting points of the two\r\ncomponents. This behaviour, however, is rather exceptional, the\r\nfreezing-point curve lying generally above, sometimes also below, the\r\nstraight line joining the melting points of the pure components. Thus the\r\nfreezing-point curve of mixtures of [alpha]-monochlorocinnamic aldehyde and\r\n[alpha]-monobromocinnamic aldehyde[270] lies above the {184} straight line\r\njoining the melting points of the pure components (31.22deg and 69.56deg),\r\nas is evident from the following table:--\r\n\r\n  ----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  Molecules of bromo-        |                 |\r\n  cinnamic aldehyde in       | Freezing point. | Deviation from straight\r\n  100 mols. of mixture.      |                 | line.\r\n  ----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n          0.00               |  31.22deg       |       --\r\n         10.48               |  37.28deg       |     2.04deg\r\n         21.91               |  43.12deg       |     3.50deg\r\n         30.07               |  46.80deg       |     4.05deg\r\n         45.04               |  52.94deg       |     4.45deg\r\n         62.16               |  58.82deg       |     3.77deg\r\n         82.98               |  65.07deg       |     2.03deg\r\n         93.50               |  67.91deg       |     0.84deg\r\n        100.00               |  69.56deg       |       --\r\n  ----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nMelting-point Curve.--This curve, like the freezing-point curve, must also\r\nbe continuous, and the melting points of the different solid solutions will\r\nlie between the melting points of the pure components. This is represented\r\nby the dotted line in Fig. 49, I. The relative position of the two curves,\r\nwhich can be deduced with the help of thermodynamics and also by\r\nexperimental determination, is found in all cases to be in accordance with\r\nthe following rule: At any given temperature, _the concentration of that\r\ncomponent by the addition of which the freezing point is depressed, is\r\ngreater in the liquid than in the solid phase_; or, conversely, _the\r\nconcentration of that component by the addition of which the freezing point\r\nis raised, is greater in the solid than in the liquid phase_. An\r\nillustration of this rule is afforded by the two substances chloro- and\r\nbromo-cinnamic aldehyde already mentioned. As can be seen from the above\r\ntable, the addition of chlorocinnamic aldehyde lowers the melting point of\r\nthe bromo-compound. In accordance with the rule, therefore, the\r\nconcentration of the chloro-compound in the liquid phase must be greater\r\nthan in the solid phase; and this was found experimentally. At a\r\ntemperature of 49.44deg, the liquid contained 58.52 per cent., the solid\r\nonly 52.57 per cent. of the chlorocinnamic aldehyde.\r\n\r\nFrom this it will also be clear that on cooling a fused mixture of two\r\nsubstances capable of forming mixed crystals, {185} the temperature of\r\nsolidification will not remain constant during the separation of the solid;\r\nnor, on the other hand, will the temperature of liquefaction of the solid\r\nsolution be constant. Thus, for example, if a liquid solution of two\r\ncomponents, A and B, having the composition represented by the point _x_\r\n(Fig. 50), is allowed to cool, the system will pass along the line _xx'_.\r\nAt the temperature of the point _a_, mixed crystals will be deposited, the\r\ncomposition of which will be that represented by b. As the temperature\r\ncontinues to fall, more and more solid will be deposited; and since the\r\nsolid phase is relatively rich in the component B, the liquid will become\r\nrelatively poorer in this. The composition of the liquid solution will\r\ntherefore pass along the curve _ad_, the composition of the solid solution\r\nat the same time passing along the curve _bc_; at the point _c_ the liquid\r\nwill solidify completely.[271]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 50.]\r\n\r\nConversely, if mixed crystals of the composition and at the temperature\r\n_x'_ are heated, liquefaction will begin at the temperature _c_, yielding a\r\nliquid of the composition d. On continuing to add heat, the temperature of\r\nthe mass will rise, more of the solid will melt, and the composition of the\r\ntwo phases will change as represented by the curves _da_ and _cb_. When the\r\ntemperature has risen to _a_, complete liquefaction will have occurred. The\r\nprocess of solidification or of liquefaction is therefore extended over a\r\ntemperature interval _ac_.\r\n\r\nEven when the freezing-point curve is a straight line joining {186} the\r\nmelting points of the pure components, the melting-point curve will not\r\nnecessarily coincide with the freezing-point curve, although it may\r\napproach very near to it; complete coincidence can take place only when the\r\nmelting points of the two components are identical. An example of this will\r\nbe given later (Chap. XII.).\r\n\r\n(_b_) _The freezing-point curve passes through a maximum_ (Curve II., Fig.\r\n49).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 51.]\r\n\r\nThis curve exhibits the greatest degree of contrast to the freezing-point\r\ncurve which is obtained when the pure components crystallize out. For,\r\nsince the curve passes through a maximum, it is evident that the freezing\r\npoint of each of the components must be _raised_ by the addition of the\r\nother component.\r\n\r\nExample.--Very few cases belonging to this type are known. The best example\r\nis found in the freezing-point curve of mixtures of _d_- and\r\n_l_-carvoxime[272] (C_{10}H_{14}N.OH). The freezing points and melting\r\npoints of the different mixtures of _d_- and _l_-carvoxime are given in the\r\nfollowing table, and represented graphically in Fig. 51:--\r\n\r\n  ---------------+----------------+-----------------+-----------------\r\n  Per cent. of   | Per cent. of   | Freezing point. | Melting point.\r\n  _d_-carvoxime. | _l_-carvoxime. |                 |\r\n  ---------------+----------------+-----------------+-----------------\r\n     100         |      0         |     72.0deg     |    72.0deg\r\n      99         |      1         |     72.4deg     |      --\r\n      98         |      2         |     73.0deg     |      --\r\n      95         |      5         |     75.4deg     |    73.0deg\r\n      90         |     10         |     79.0deg     |    75.0deg\r\n      80         |     20         |     84.6deg     |    80.0deg\r\n      70         |     30         |     88.2deg     |    85.0deg\r\n      60         |     40         |     90.4deg     |      --\r\n      50         |     50         |     91.4deg     |    91.4deg\r\n      25         |     75         |     86.4deg     |    82.0deg\r\n       8         |     92         |     77.4deg     |      --\r\n       1         |     99         |     72.4deg     |      --\r\n       0         |    100         |     72.0deg     |    72.0deg\r\n  ---------------+----------------+-----------------+-----------------\r\n\r\n{187}\r\n\r\nIn this figure, the melting-point curve, _i.e._ the\r\ntemperature-concentration curve for the mixed crystals, is represented by\r\nthe lower curve. Since the addition of the laevo-form to the dextro-form\r\nraises the melting point of the latter, the concentration of the laevo-form\r\n(on the right-hand branch of the curve) must, in accordance with the rule\r\ngiven, be greater in the solid phase than in the liquid. Similarly, since\r\naddition of the dextro-form raises the melting point of the laevo-form, the\r\nsolid phase (on the left-hand branch of the curve) must be richer in\r\ndextro- than in laevo-carvoxime. At the maximum point, the melting-point\r\nand freezing-point curves touch; at this point, therefore, the composition\r\nof the solid and liquid phases must be identical. It is evident, therefore,\r\nthat at the maximum point the liquid will solidify, or the solid will\r\nliquefy completely without change of temperature; and, accordingly, mixed\r\ncrystals of the composition represented by the maximum point will exhibit a\r\ndefinite melting point, and will in this respect behave like a simple\r\nsubstance.\r\n\r\n(_c_) _The freezing-point curve passes through a minimum_ (Curve III., Fig.\r\n49).\r\n\r\nIn this case, as in the case of those systems where the pure components are\r\ndeposited, a minimum freezing point is obtained. In the latter case,\r\nhowever, there are two freezing-point curves which intersect at a eutectic\r\npoint; in the case where mixed crystals are formed there is only one\r\ncontinuous curve. On one side of the minimum point the liquid phase\r\ncontains relatively more, on the other side relatively less, of the one\r\ncomponent than does the solid phase; while at the minimum point the\r\ncomposition of the two phases is the same. At this point, therefore,\r\ncomplete solidification or complete liquefaction will occur without change\r\nof temperature, and the mixed crystals will accordingly exhibit a definite\r\nmelting point.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 52.]\r\n\r\n{188}\r\n\r\nExample.--As an example of this there may be taken the mixed crystals of\r\nmercuric bromide and iodide.[273] Mercuric bromide melts at 236.5deg, and\r\nmercuric iodide at 255.4deg. The mixed crystal of definite constant melting\r\npoint (minimum point) contains 59 mols. per cent. of mercuric bromide, the\r\nmelting point being 216.1deg.\r\n\r\nThe numerical data are contained in the following table, and represented\r\ngraphically in Fig. 52:--\r\n\r\n  -----------------------------------------------------\r\n  Mols. per cent. of |                 |\r\n  HgBr_{2}.          | Freezing point. | Melting point.\r\n  -----------------------------------------------------\r\n        100          |    236.5deg     |     236deg\r\n         90          |    228.8deg     |     226deg\r\n         80          |    222.2deg     |     219deg\r\n         70          |    217.8deg     |     217deg\r\n         65          |    216.6deg     |     216deg\r\n         60          |    216.1deg     |     215.5deg\r\n         55          |    216.3deg     |     216deg\r\n         50          |    217.3deg     |     216deg\r\n         40          |    221.1deg     |     218deg\r\n         30          |    227.8deg     |     223deg\r\n         20          |    236.2deg     |     231deg\r\n         10          |    245.5deg     |     242deg\r\n          0          |    255.4deg     |     254deg\r\n  -----------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 53.]\r\n\r\nFractional Crystallization of Mixed Crystals.--With the help of the\r\ndiagrams already given it will be possible to predict what will be the\r\nresult of the fractional crystallization of a fused mixture of two\r\nsubstances which can form mixed crystals. Suppose, for example, a fused\r\nmixture of the composition _x_ (Fig. 53) is cooled down; then, as we have\r\nalready seen, when the temperature has fallen to _a_, mixed crystals of\r\ncomposition, _b_, are deposited. If the temperature is allowed to fall\r\n{189} to _x'_, and the solid then separated from the liquid, the mixed\r\ncrystals so obtained will have the composition represented by e. If, now,\r\nthe mixed crystals _e_ are completely fused and the fused mass allowed to\r\ncool, separation of solid will occur when the temperature has fallen to the\r\npoint _f_. The mixed crystals which are deposited have now the composition\r\nrepresented by _g_, i.e. _they are richer in B than the original mixed\r\ncrystals_. By repeating this process, the composition of the successive\r\ncrops of mixed crystals which are obtained approximates more and more to\r\nthat of the pure component B, while, on the other hand, the composition of\r\nthe liquid phase produced tends to that of pure A. By a systematic and\r\nmethodical repetition of the process of fractional crystallization,\r\ntherefore, a _practically_ complete separation of the components can be\r\neffected; a perfect separation is theoretically impossible.\r\n\r\nFrom this it will be readily understood that in the case of substances the\r\nfreezing point of which passes through a maximum, fractional\r\ncrystallization will ultimately lead to mixed crystals having the\r\ncomposition of the maximum point, while the liquid phase will more and more\r\nassume the composition of either pure A or pure B, according as the initial\r\ncomposition was on the A side or the B side of the maximum point. In those\r\ncases, however, where the curves exhibit a minimum, the solid phase which\r\nseparates out will ultimately be one of the pure components, while a liquid\r\nphase will finally be obtained which has the composition of the minimum\r\npoint.\r\n\r\nII.--THE TWO COMPONENTS DO NOT FORM A CONTINUOUS SERIES OF MIXED CRYSTALS.\r\n\r\nThis case corresponds to that of the partial miscibility of liquids. The\r\nsolid component A can \"dissolve\" the component B until the concentration of\r\nthe latter in the mixed crystal has reached a certain value. Addition of a\r\nfurther amount of B will not alter the composition of the mixed crystal,\r\nbut there will be formed a second solid phase consisting {190} of a\r\nsolution of A in B. At this point the four phases, mixed crystals\r\ncontaining excess of A, mixed crystals containing excess of B, liquid\r\nsolution, vapour, can coexist; this will therefore be an invariant point.\r\nThe temperature-concentration curves will therefore no longer be\r\ncontinuous, but will exhibit a break or discontinuity at the point at which\r\nthe invariant system is formed.\r\n\r\n(_a_) _The freezing-point curve exhibits a transition point_ (Curve I.,\r\nFig. 54).\r\n\r\nAs is evident from the figure, addition of B raises the melting point of A,\r\nand, in accordance with the rule previously given, the concentration of B\r\nin the mixed crystals will be greater than in the solution. This is\r\nrepresented in the figure by the dotted curve AD. On the other hand,\r\naddition of A lowers the melting point of B, and the two curves BC and BE\r\nare obtained for the liquid and solid phases respectively. At the\r\ntemperature of the line CDE the liquid solution of the composition\r\nrepresented by C is in equilibrium with the two different mixed crystals\r\nrepresented by D and E. At this temperature, therefore, the _tc_-curve for\r\nthe solid phase exhibits a discontinuity; and, since the solid phase\r\nundergoes change at this point, the freezing-point curve must show a break\r\n(p. 111).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 54.]\r\n\r\nExample.--Curves of the form given in Fig. 54 I. have been found\r\nexperimentally in the case of silver nitrate and sodium nitrate.[274] The\r\nfollowing table contains the numerical data, which are also represented\r\ngraphically in Fig. 55:--\r\n\r\n{191}\r\n\r\n  -----------------------------------------------------\r\n  Molecules NaNO_{3} | Freezing point. | Melting point.\r\n      per cent.      |                 |\r\n  -----------------------------------------------------\r\n          0          |     208.6deg    |    208.6deg\r\n          8          |     211.4deg    |    210deg\r\n         15.06       |     215deg      |    212deg\r\n         19.46       |     217.2deg    |    214.8deg\r\n         21.9        |     222deg      |    215deg\r\n         26          |     228.4deg    |    216.5deg\r\n         29.7        |     234.8deg    |    217.5deg\r\n         36.2        |     244.4deg    |    217.5deg\r\n         47.3        |     259.4deg    |    237.6deg\r\n         58.9        |     272deg      |    257deg\r\n         72          |     284deg      |    274deg\r\n        100          |     308deg      |    308deg\r\n  -----------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe temperature of the transition point is 217.5deg; at this point the\r\nliquid contains 19.5, and the two conjugate solid solutions 26 and 38\r\nmolecules of sodium nitrate per cent. respectively.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 55.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 56.]\r\n\r\n(_b_) _The freezing-point curve exhibits a eutectic point_ (Curve II., Fig.\r\n54). {192}\r\n\r\nIn this case the freezing point of each of the components is lowered by the\r\naddition of the other, until at last a point is reached at which the liquid\r\nsolution solidifies to a mixture or conglomerate of two mixed crystals.\r\n\r\nExamples.--Curves belonging to this class have been obtained in the case of\r\npotassium and thallium nitrates[275] and of naphthalene and monochloracetic\r\nacid.[276] The data for the latter are given in the following table and\r\nrepresented in Fig. 56:--\r\n\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n               |         Liquid solution.     |        Solid solution.\r\n               ------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  Temperature. |              |               |              |\r\n               |  Per cent.   |   Per cent.   |  Per cent.   |   Per cent.\r\n               | naphthalene. |     acid.     | naphthalene. |     acid.\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n     62deg     |     --       |     100       |     --       |     100\r\n     60deg     |      4.0     |      96.0     |      1.7     |      98.3\r\n     55deg     |     21.0     |      79.0     |      2.1     |      97.9\r\n     53.5deg   |     29.4     |      70.0     |     --       |      --\r\n     55deg     |     31.3     |      68.7     |     59.6     |      40.4\r\n     60deg     |     42.4     |      57.6     |     80.3     |      19.7\r\n     65deg     |     53.3     |      46.7     |     89.2     |      10.8\r\n     70deg     |     69.7     |       2.3     |     95.4     |       4.6\r\n     75deg     |     84.4     |      15.6     |     96.6     |       3.4\r\n     79.9deg   |    100       |      --       |    100       |      --\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nAt the eutectic point the liquid solution is in equilibrium with two\r\ndifferent mixed crystals the composition of which is represented by D and E\r\nrespectively. If, therefore, a fused mixture containing the two components\r\nA and B in the proportions represented by C is cooled down, it will, when\r\nthe temperature has reached the point C, solidify completely to a\r\n_conglomerate_ of mixed crystals, D and E.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 57.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 58.]\r\n\r\nChanges in Mixed Crystals with the Temperature.--In the case of the\r\ndifferent types of systems represented in Fig. 49, a homogeneous liquid\r\nsolution of the two components will exist at temperatures above the\r\nfreezing-point curve, a homogeneous mixed crystal at temperatures below the\r\nmelting-point curve, while at any point between the freezing-point and\r\nmelting-point {193} curves the mixture will separate into a solid phase and\r\na liquid phase. In the case, however, of the two types shown in Fig. 54 the\r\nrelationships are somewhat more complicated. As before, the area above the\r\nfreezing-point curve gives the conditions under which homogeneous liquid\r\nsolutions can exist; but below the melting-point curve two different mixed\r\ncrystals can coexist. This will be best understood from Figs. 57 and 58. D\r\nand E represent, as we have seen, the composition of two mixed crystals\r\nwhich are in equilibrium with the liquid solution at the temperature of the\r\npoint C. These two mixed crystals represent, in the one case, a saturated\r\nsolution of B in A (point D), and the other a saturated solution of A in B\r\n(point E). Just as we saw that the mutual solubility of two liquids varied\r\nwith the temperature, so also in the case of two solids; as the temperature\r\nalters, the solubility of the two solid components in one another will\r\nchange. This alteration is indicated diagrammatically in Figs. 57 and 58 by\r\nthe dotted curve similar to the solubility curves for two mutually soluble\r\nliquids (p. 101).\r\n\r\nSuppose, now, that a mixed crystal of the composition _x_ is cooled down,\r\nit will remain unchanged until, when the temperature has fallen to _t'_,\r\nthe homogeneous mixed crystal breaks up into a conglomerate of two mixed\r\ncrystals the composition of {194} which is represented by _x'_ and _x\"_\r\nrespectively. From this, then, it can be seen that in the case of\r\nsubstances which form two solid solutions, the mixed crystals which are\r\ndesposited from the liquid fused mass need not remain unchanged in the\r\nsolid state, but may at some lower temperature lose their homogeneity. This\r\nfact is of considerable importance for the formation of alloys.[277]\r\n\r\nA good example of this will soon be met with in the case of the iron and\r\ncarbon alloys. The alloys of copper and tin also furnish examples of the\r\ngreat changes which may take place in the alloy between the temperature at\r\nwhich it separates out from the fused mass and the ordinary temperature.\r\nThus, for example, one of the alloys of copper and tin which separates out\r\nfrom the liquid as a solid solution breaks up, on cooling, into the\r\ncompound Cu_{3}Sn and liquid:[278] a striking example of a solid substance\r\npartially liquefying on being cooled.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{195}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nEQUILIBRIUM BETWEEN DYNAMIC ISOMERIDES\r\n\r\nIt has long been known that certain substances, _e.g._ acetoacetic ester,\r\nare capable when in solution or in the fused state, of reacting as if they\r\npossessed two different constitutions; and in order to explain this\r\nbehaviour the view was advanced (by Laar) that in such cases a hydrogen\r\natom oscillated between two positions in the molecule, being at one time\r\nattached to oxygen, at another time to carbon, as represented by the\r\nformula--\r\n\r\n  CH_{3}.C--CH.CO_{2}C_{2}H_{5}\r\n         .  ^\r\n         .  |\r\n         O<-H\r\n\r\nWhen the hydrogen is in one position, the substance will act as an\r\nhydroxy-compound; with hydrogen in the other position, as a ketone.\r\nSubstances possessing this double function are called _tautomeric_.\r\n\r\nDoubt, however, arose as to the validity of the above explanation, and this\r\ndoubt was confirmed by the isolation of the two isomerides in the solid\r\nstate, and also by the fact that the velocity of change of the one\r\nisomeride into the other could in some cases be quantitatively measured.\r\nThese and other observations then led to the view, in harmony with the laws\r\nof chemical dynamics, that tautomeric substances in the dissolved or fused\r\nstate represent a _mixture_ of two isomeric forms, and that equilibrium is\r\nestablished not by _intra_- but by _inter_-molecular change, as expressed\r\nby the equation--\r\n\r\n  CH_{3}.CO.CH_{2}.CO_{2}C_{2}H_{5} <--> CH_{3}.C(OH):CH.CO_{2}C_{2}H_{5}\r\n\r\n{196} In the solid state, the one or other of the isomerides represents the\r\nstable form; but in the liquid state (solution or fusion) the stable\r\ncondition is an equilibrium between the two forms.\r\n\r\nA similar behaviour is also found in the case of other isomeric substances\r\nwhere the isomerism is due to difference of structure, _i.e._ structure\r\nisomerism (_e.g._ in the case of the oximes\r\n\r\n  C_{6}H_{5}.C.H      C_{6}H_{5}.C.H\r\n             ||   and            ||  ),\r\n             N.OH             HO.N\r\n\r\nor to difference in configuration, _i.e._ stereoisomerism (_e.g._ optically\r\nactive substances), or to polymerism (_e.g._ acetaldehyde and paraldehyde).\r\nIn all such cases, although the different solid forms correspond to a\r\nsingle definite constitution, in the liquid state a condition of\r\nequilibrium between the two modifications is established. As a general name\r\nfor these different classes of substances, the term \"dynamic isomerides\"\r\nhas been introduced; and the different kinds of isomerism are classed\r\ntogether under the title \"dynamic isomerism.\"[279]\r\n\r\nBy reason of the importance of these phenomena in the study more especially\r\nof Organic Chemistry, a brief account of the equilibrium relations\r\nexhibited by systems composed of dynamic isomerides may be given here.[280]\r\n\r\nIn studying the fusion and solidification of those substances which exhibit\r\nthe relationships of dynamic isomerism, the phenomena observed will vary\r\nsomewhat according as the reversible transformation of the one form into\r\nthe other takes place with measurable velocity at temperatures in the\r\nneighbourhood of the melting points, or only at some higher temperature. If\r\nthe transformation is very rapid, the system will behave like a\r\none-component system, but if the isomeric change is comparatively slow, the\r\nbehaviour will be that of a two-component system.\r\n\r\nTemperature-Concentration Diagram.--The relationships which are met with\r\nhere will be most readily understood with {197} the help of Fig. 59.\r\nSuppose, in the first instance, that isomeric transformation does not take\r\nplace at the temperature of the melting point, then the freezing point\r\ncurve will have the simple form ACB; the formation of compounds being for\r\nthe present excluded. This is the simplest type of curve, and gives the\r\ncomposition of the solutions in equilibrium with the one modification\r\n([alpha] modification) at different temperatures (curve AC); and of the\r\nsolutions in equilibrium with the other modification ([beta] modification)\r\nat different temperatures (curve BC). C is the eutectic point at which the\r\ntwo solid isomerides can exist side by side in contact with the solution.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 59.]\r\n\r\nNow, suppose that isomeric transformation takes place with measurable\r\nvelocity. If the pure [alpha]-modification is heated to a temperature _t'_\r\nabove its melting point, and the liquid maintained at that temperature\r\nuntil equilibrium has been established, a certain amount of the [beta]-form\r\nwill be present in the liquid, the composition of which will be represented\r\nby the point _x'_. The same condition of equilibrium will also be reached\r\nby starting with pure [beta]. Similarly, if the temperature of the liquid\r\nis maintained at the temperature _t\"_, equilibrium will be reached, we\r\nshall suppose, when the solution has the composition _x\"_. The curve DE,\r\ntherefore, which passes through all the different values of _x_\r\ncorresponding to different values of _t_, will represent the change of\r\nequilibrium with the temperature. It will slope to the right (as in the\r\nfigure) if the transformation of [alpha] into [beta] is accompanied by\r\nabsorption of heat; to the left if the transformation is accompanied by\r\nevolution of heat, in accordance with van't Hoff's Law of movable\r\nequilibrium. If transformation occurs without heat effect, the equilibrium\r\nwill be independent of the {198} temperature, and the equilibrium curve DE\r\nwill therefore be perpendicular and parallel to the temperature axis.\r\n\r\nWe must now find the meaning of the point D. Suppose the pure [alpha]- or\r\npure [beta]-form heated to the temperature _t'_, and the temperature\r\nmaintained constant until the liquid has the composition _x'_ corresponding\r\nto the equilibrium at that temperature. If the temperature is now allowed\r\nto fall sufficiently slowly so that the condition of equilibrium is\r\ncontinually readjusted as the temperature changes, the composition of the\r\nsolution will gradually alter as represented by the curve _x'_D. Since D is\r\non the freezing point curve of pure [alpha], this form will be deposited on\r\ncooling; and since D is also on the equilibrium curve of the liquid, D is\r\nthe only point at which solid can exist in stable equilibrium with the\r\nliquid phase. (The vapour phase may be omitted from consideration, as we\r\nshall suppose the experiments carried out in open vessels.) All systems\r\nconsisting of the two hylotropic[281] isomeric substances [alpha] and\r\n[beta] will, therefore, ultimately freeze at the point D, which is called\r\nthe \"natural\" freezing point[282] of the system; provided, of course, that\r\nsufficient time is allowed for equilibrium to be established. From this it\r\nis apparent that _the stable modification at temperatures in the\r\nneighbourhood of the melting point is that which is in equilibrium with the\r\nliquid phase at the natural freezing point_.\r\n\r\nFrom what has been said, it will be easy to predict what will be the\r\nbehaviour of the system under different conditions. If pure [alpha] is\r\nheated, a temperature will be reached at which it will melt, but this\r\nmelting point will be sharp only if the velocity of isomeric transformation\r\nis comparatively slow; _i.e._ slow in comparison with the determination of\r\nthe melting point. If the substance be maintained in the fused condition\r\nfor some time, a certain amount of the [beta] modification will be formed,\r\nand on lowering the temperature the pure [alpha] form will be deposited,\r\nnot at the temperature of the melting point, but at some lower temperature\r\ndepending on the concentration of the [beta] modification in the liquid\r\nphase. If isomeric transformation {199} takes place slowly in comparison\r\nwith the rate at which deposition of the solid occurs, the liquid will\r\nbecome increasingly rich in the [beta] modification, and the freezing point\r\nwill, therefore, sink continuously. At the eutectic point, however, the\r\n[beta] modification will also be deposited, and the temperature will remain\r\nconstant until all has become solid. If, on the other hand, the velocity of\r\ntransformation is sufficiently rapid, then as quickly as the [alpha]\r\nmodification is deposited, the equilibrium between the two isomeric forms\r\nin the liquid phase will continuously readjust itself, and the end-point of\r\nsolidification will be the natural freezing point.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, starting with the pure [beta] modification, the freezing point\r\nafter fusion will gradually fall owing to the formation of the [alpha]\r\nmodification; and the composition of the liquid phase will pass along the\r\ncurve BC. If, now, the rate of cooling is not too great, or if the velocity\r\nof isomeric transformation is sufficiently rapid, complete solidification\r\nwill not occur at the eutectic point; for at this temperature solid and\r\nliquid are not in stable equilibrium with one another. On the contrary, a\r\nfurther quantity of the [beta] modification will undergo isomeric change,\r\nthe liquid phase will become richer in the [alpha] form, and the freezing\r\npoint will _rise_; the solid phase in contact with the liquid being now the\r\n[alpha] modification. The freezing point will continue to rise until the\r\npoint D is reached, at which complete solidification will take place\r\nwithout further change of temperature.\r\n\r\nThe diagram also allows us to predict what will be the result of rapidly\r\ncooling a fused mixture of the two isomerides. Suppose that either the\r\n[alpha] or the [beta] modification has been maintained in the fused state\r\nat the temperature _t'_ sufficiently long for equilibrium to be\r\nestablished. The composition of the liquid phase will be represented by\r\n_x'_. If the liquid is now _rapidly_ cooled, the composition will remain\r\nunchanged as represented by the dotted line _x'_G. At the temperature of\r\nthe point G solid [alpha] modification will be deposited. If the cooling is\r\nnot carried below the point G, so as to cause complete solidification, the\r\nfreezing point will be found to rise with time, owing to the conversion of\r\nsome of the [beta] form into the [alpha] form {200} in the liquid phase;\r\nand this will continue until the composition of the liquid has reached the\r\npoint D. From what has just been said, it can also be seen that if the\r\nfreezing point curves can be obtained by actual determination of the\r\nfreezing points of different synthetic mixtures of the two isomerides, it\r\nwill be possible to determine the condition of equilibrium in the fused\r\nstate at any given temperature without having recourse to analysis. All\r\nthat is necessary is to rapidly cool the fused mass, after equilibrium has\r\nbeen established, and find the freezing point at which solid is deposited;\r\nthat is, find the point at which the line of constant temperature cuts the\r\nfreezing point curve. The composition corresponding to this temperature\r\ngives the composition of the equilibrium mixture at the given temperature.\r\n\r\nIt will be evident, from what has gone before, that the degree of\r\ncompleteness with which the different curves can be realised will depend on\r\nthe velocity with which isomeric change takes place, and on the rapidity\r\nwith which the determinations of the freezing point can be carried out. As\r\nthe two extremes we have, on the one hand, practically instantaneous\r\ntransformation, and on the other, practically infinite slowness of\r\ntransformation. In the former case, only one melting and freezing point\r\nwill be found, viz. the natural freezing point; in the latter case, the two\r\nisomerides will behave as two perfectly independent components, and the\r\nequilibrium curve DE will not be realised.\r\n\r\nThe diagram which is obtained when isomeric transformation does not occur\r\nwithin measurable time at the temperature of the melting point is somewhat\r\ndifferent from that already given in Fig. 59. In this case, the two\r\nfreezing point curves AC and BC (Fig. 60) can be readily realized, as no\r\nisomeric change occurs in the liquid phase. Suppose, however, that at a\r\nhigher temperature, _t'_, reversible isomeric transformation can take\r\nplace, the composition of the liquid phase will alter until at the point\r\n_x'_ a condition of equilibrium is reached; and the composition of the\r\nliquid at higher temperatures will be represented by the curve _x'_F. Below\r\nthe temperature _t'_ the position of the equilibrium curve is hypothetical;\r\nbut as the temperature {201} falls the velocity of transformation\r\ndiminishes, and at last becomes _practically_ zero. The equilibrium curve\r\ncan therefore be regarded as dividing into two branches _x'_G and _x'_H. At\r\ntemperatures between G and _t'_ the [alpha] modification can undergo\r\nisomeric change leading to a point on the curve G_x'_; and the [beta]\r\nmodification can undergo change leading to a point on the curve H_x'_. The\r\nsame condition of equilibrium is therefore not reached from each side, and\r\nwe are therefore dealing not with true but with false equilibrium (p. 5).\r\nBelow the temperatures G and H, isomeric transformation does not occur in\r\nmeasurable time. We shall not, however, enter into a detailed discussion of\r\nthe equilibria in such systems, more especially as they are not systems in\r\ntrue equilibrium, and as the temperature at which true equilibrium can be\r\nestablished with appreciable velocity alters under the influence of\r\ncatalytic agents.[283] Examples of such systems will no doubt be found in\r\nthe case of optically active substances, where both isomerides are\r\napparently quite stable at the melting point. In the case of such\r\nsubstances, also, the action of catalytic agents in producing isomeric\r\ntransformation (racemisation) is well known.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 60.]\r\n\r\nTransformation of the Unstable into the Stable Form.--As has already been\r\nstated, the stable modification in the neighbourhood of the melting point\r\nis that one which is in equilibrium with the liquid phase at the natural\r\nfreezing point. In the case of polymorphic substances, we have seen (p. 39)\r\nthat that form which is stable in the neighbourhood of the melting point\r\nmelts at the higher temperature. That was a {202} consequence of the fact\r\nthat the two polymorphic forms on melting gave identical liquid phases. In\r\nthe present case, however, the above rule does not apply, for the simple\r\nreason that the liquid phase obtained by the fusion of the one modification\r\nis not identical with that obtained by the fusion of the other. In the case\r\nof isomeric substances, therefore, the form of lower melting point _may_ be\r\nthe more stable; and where this behaviour is found it is a sign that the\r\ntwo forms are isomeric (or polymeric) and not polymorphic.[284] An example\r\nof this is found in the case of the isomeric benzaldoximes (p. 203).\r\n\r\nSince in Fig. 59 the [alpha] modification has been represented as the\r\nstable form, the transformation of the [beta] into the [alpha] form will be\r\npossible at all temperatures down to the transition point. At temperatures\r\nbelow the eutectic point, transformation will occur without formation of a\r\nliquid phase; but at temperatures above the eutectic point liquefaction can\r\ntake place. This will be more readily understood by drawing a line of\r\nconstant temperature, HK, at some point between C and B. Then if the [beta]\r\nmodification is maintained for a sufficiently long time at that\r\ntemperature, a certain amount of the [alpha] modification will be formed;\r\nand when the composition of the mixture has reached the point H, fusion\r\nwill occur. If the temperature is maintained constant, isomeric\r\ntransformation will continue to take place in the liquid phase until the\r\nequilibrium point for that temperature is reached. If this temperature is\r\nhigher than the natural melting point, the mixture will remain liquid all\r\nthe time; but if it is below the natural melting point, then the [alpha]\r\nmodification will be deposited when the system reaches the condition\r\nrepresented by the point on the curve AC corresponding to the particular\r\ntemperature. As isomeric transformation continues, the freezing point of\r\nthe system will rise until it reaches the natural freezing point D.\r\nSimilarly, if the [alpha] modification is maintained at a temperature above\r\nthat of the point D, liquefaction will ultimately occur, and the system\r\nwill again reach the final state represented by D.[285]\r\n\r\n{203}\r\n\r\nExamples.--_Benzaldoximes._ The relationships which have just been\r\ndiscussed from the theoretical point of view will be rendered clearer by a\r\nbrief description of cases which have been experimentally investigated.

The freezing curves\r\nAC and BC were obtained by determining the freezing points of different\r\nmixtures of known composition, and the numbers so obtained are given in the\r\nfollowing table.\r\n\r\n{204}\r\n\r\n  ----------------------------------------------------\r\n  Grams of the [alpha] modification |\r\n    in 100 gm. of mixture.          | Freezing point.\r\n  ----------------------------------+-----------------\r\n               26.2                 |    101deg\r\n               49.2                 |     79deg\r\n               73.7                 |     46deg\r\n               91.7                 |     26.2deg\r\n               95.0                 |     28.6deg\r\n               96.0                 |     30.0deg\r\n  ----------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 61.]\r\n\r\nThe eutectic point C was found to lie at 25-26deg, and the natural freezing\r\npoint D was found to be 27.7deg. The equilibrium curve DE was determined by\r\nheating the liquid mixtures at different temperatures until equilibrium was\r\nattained, and then rapidly cooling the liquid. In all cases the freezing\r\npoint was practically that of the point D. From this it is seen that the\r\nequilibrium curve must be a straight line parallel to the temperature axis;\r\nand, therefore, isomeric transformation in the case of the two\r\nbenzaldoximes is not accompanied by any heat effect (p. 197). This\r\nbehaviour has also been found in the case of acetaldoxime.[287]\r\n\r\nThe isomeric benzaldoximes are also of interest from the fact that the\r\nstable modification has the _lower_ melting point (_v._ p. 202).\r\n\r\n_Acetaldehyde and Paraldehyde._--As a second example of the equilibria\r\nbetween two isomerides, we shall take the two isomeric (polymeric) forms of\r\nacetaldehyde, which have recently been exhaustively studied.[288]\r\n\r\n{205}\r\n\r\nIn the case of these two substances the reaction\r\n\r\n  3CH_{3}.CHO <--> (CH_{3}.CHO)_{3}\r\n\r\ntakes place at the ordinary temperature with very great slowness. For this\r\nreason it is possible to determine the freezing point curves of\r\nacetaldehyde and paraldehyde. The three chief points on these curves,\r\nrepresented graphically in Fig. 62, are:--\r\n\r\n  m.p. of acetaldehyde - 118.45deg\r\n  m.p. of paraldehyde  +  12.55deg\r\n  eutectic point       - 119.9deg\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 62.]\r\n\r\nIn order to determine the position of the natural melting point, it was\r\nnecessary, on account of the slowness of transformation, to employ a\r\ncatalytic agent in order to increase the velocity with which the\r\nequilibrium was established. A drop of concentrated sulphuric acid served\r\nthe purpose. In presence of a trace of this substance, isomeric\r\ntransformation very speedily occurs, and leads to the condition of\r\nequilibrium. Starting in the one case with fused paraldehyde, and in the\r\nother case with acetaldehyde, the same freezing point, viz. 6.75deg, was\r\nobtained, the solid phase being paraldehyde. This temperature, 6.75deg, is\r\ntherefore the natural freezing point, and paraldehyde, the solid in\r\nequilibrium with the liquid phase at this point, is the stable form.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the change of equilibrium with the temperature, it was found\r\nthat whereas the liquid phase contained 11.7 molecules per cent. of\r\nacetaldehyde at the natural freezing point, the liquid at the temperature\r\nof 41.6deg contains 46.6 molecules per cent. of acetaldehyde. As the\r\ntemperature {206} rises, therefore, there is increased formation of\r\nacetaldehyde, or a decreasing amount of polymerisation. This is in harmony\r\nwith the fact that the polymerisation of acetaldehyde is accompanied by\r\nevolution of heat.\r\n\r\nWhile speaking of these isomerides, it may be mentioned that at the\r\ntemperature 41.6deg the equilibrium mixture has a vapour pressure equal to\r\nthe atmospheric pressure. At this temperature, therefore, the equilibrium\r\nmixture (obtained quickly with the help of a trace of sulphuric acid)\r\nboils.[289]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{207}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nSUMMARY.--APPLICATION OF THE PHASE RULE TO THE STUDY OF SYSTEMS OF TWO\r\nCOMPONENTS\r\n\r\nIn this concluding chapter on two-component systems, it is proposed to\r\nindicate briefly how the Phase Rule has been applied to the elucidation of\r\na number of problems connected with the equilibria between two components,\r\nand how it has been employed for the interpretation of the data obtained by\r\nexperiment. It is hoped that the practical value of the Phase Rule may\r\nthereby become more apparent, and its application to other cases be\r\nrendered easier.\r\n\r\nThe interest and importance of investigations into the conditions of\r\nequilibrium between two substances, lie in the determination not only of\r\nthe conditions for the stable existence of the participating substances,\r\nbut also of whether or not chemical action takes place between these two\r\ncomponents; and if combination occurs, in the determination of the nature\r\nof the compounds formed and the range of their existence. In all such\r\ninvestigations, the Phase Rule becomes of conspicuous value on account of\r\nthe fact that its principles afford, as it were, a touchstone by which the\r\ncharacter of the system can be determined, and that from the form of the\r\nequilibrium curves obtained, conclusions can be drawn as to the nature of\r\nthe interaction between the two substances. In order to exemplify the\r\napplication of the principles of the Phase Rule more fully than has already\r\nbeen done, illustrations will be drawn from investigations on the\r\ninteraction of organic compounds; on the equilibria between optically\r\nactive compounds; and on alloys. {208}\r\n\r\nSummary of the Different Systems of Two Components.--Before passing to the\r\nconsideration of the application of the Phase Rule to the investigation of\r\nparticular problems, it will be well to collect together the different\r\ntypes of equilibrium curves with which we are already acquainted; to\r\ncompare them with one another, in order that we may then employ these\r\ncharacteristic curves for the interpretation of the curves obtained as the\r\nresult of experiment.\r\n\r\nIn investigating the equilibria between two components, three chief classes\r\nof curves will be obtained according as--\r\n\r\nI. No combination takes place between the two components.\r\n\r\nII. The components can form definite compounds.\r\n\r\nIII. The components separate out in the form of mixed crystals.\r\n\r\nThe different types of curves which are obtained in these three cases are\r\nrepresented in Figs. 63, 64, 65. These different diagrams represent the\r\nwhole series of equilibria, from the melting point of the one component (A)\r\nto that of the other component (B). The curves represent, in all cases, the\r\ncomposition of the solution, or phase of variable composition; the\r\ntemperature being measured along one axis, and the composition along the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nWe shall now recapitulate very briefly the characteristics of the different\r\ncurves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 63.]\r\n\r\nIf no compound is formed between the two components, {209} the general form\r\nof the equilibrium curve will be that of curve I. or II., Fig. 63. Type I.\r\nis the simplest form of curve found, and consists, as the diagram shows, of\r\nonly two branches, AC and BC, meeting at the point C, _which lies below the\r\nmelting point of either component_. The solid phase which is in equilibrium\r\nwith the solutions AC is pure A; that in equilibrium with BC, pure B. C is\r\nthe eutectic point. Although at the eutectic point the solution solidifies\r\nentirely without change of temperature, the solid which is deposited is not\r\na homogeneous solid phase, but a mixture, or conglomerate of the two\r\ncomponents. _The eutectic point, therefore, represents the melting or\r\nfreezing point, not of a compound, but of a mixture_ (p. 119).\r\n\r\nCurve II., Fig. 63, is obtained when two liquid phases are formed. C is an\r\neutectic point, D and F are transition points at which there can co-exist\r\nthe four phases--solid, two liquid phases, vapour. DEF represents the\r\nchange in the composition of the two liquid phases with rise of\r\ntemperature; the curve might also have the reversed form with the critical\r\nsolution point below the transition points D and F.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 64.]\r\n\r\nIn the second class of systems (Fig. 64), that in which combination between\r\nthe components occurs, there are again two types according as the compound\r\nformed has a definite melting point (_i.e._ can exist in equilibrium with a\r\nsolution of the same composition), or undergoes only partial fusion; that\r\nis, exhibits a transition point.\r\n\r\nIf a compound possessing a definite melting point is formed, the\r\nequilibrium curve will have the general form shown by curve I., Fig. 64. A,\r\nB, and D are the melting points of pure A, pure B, and of the compound\r\nA_{x}B_{y} respectively. AC {210} is the freezing point curve of A in\r\npresence of B; BE that of B in presence of A; and DC and DE the freezing\r\npoint curves of the compound in presence of a solution containing excess of\r\none of the components. C and E are eutectic points at which mixtures of A\r\nand A_{x}B_{y}, or B and A_{x}B_{y} can co-exist in contact with solution.\r\nThe curve CDE may be large or small, and the melting point of the compound,\r\nD, may lie above or below that of each of the components, or may have an\r\nintermediate position. If more than one compound can be formed, a series of\r\ncurves similar to CDE will be obtained (_cf._ p. 152).\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if the compound undergoes transition to another solid\r\nphase at a temperature below its melting point, a curve of the form II.,\r\nFig. 64, will be found. This corresponds to the case where a compound can\r\nexist only in contact with solutions containing excess of one of the\r\ncomponents. The metastable continuation of the equilibrium curve for the\r\ncompound is indicated by the dotted line, the summit of which would be the\r\nmelting point of the compound. Before this temperature is reached, however,\r\nthe solid compound ceases to be able to exist in contact with solution, and\r\ntransition to a different solid phase occurs at the point E (_cf._ p. 134).\r\nThis point, therefore, represents the limit of the existence of the\r\ncompound AB. If a series of compounds can be formed none of which possess a\r\ndefinite melting point, then a series of curves will be obtained which do\r\nnot exhibit a temperature-maximum, and there will be only one eutectic\r\npoint. The limits of existence of each compound will be marked by a break\r\nin the curve (_cf._ p. 143).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 65.]\r\n\r\nTurning, lastly, to the third class of systems, in which formation of mixed\r\ncrystals can occur, five different types of curves can be obtained, as\r\nshown in Fig. 65. With regard to the first three types, curves I., II., and\r\nIII., {211} these differ entirely from those of the previous classes, in\r\nthat they are continuous; they exhibit no eutectic point, and no transition\r\npoint. Curve II. bears some resemblance to the melting-point curve of a\r\ncompound (_e.g._ CDE, Fig. 64, I.), but differs markedly from it in not\r\nending in eutectic points.\r\n\r\nFurther, in the case of the formation of a compound, the composition of the\r\nsolid phase remains unchanged throughout the whole curve between the\r\neutectic points; whereas, when mixed crystals are produced, the composition\r\nof the solid phase varies with the composition of the liquid solution. On\r\npassing through the maximum, the relative proportions of A and B in the\r\nsolid and the liquid phase undergo change; on the one side of the maximum,\r\nthe solid phase contains relatively more A, and on the other side of the\r\nmaximum, relatively more B than the liquid phase. Lastly, when mixed\r\ncrystals are formed, the temperature at which complete solidification\r\noccurs changes as the composition of the solution changes, whereas in the\r\ncase of the formation of compounds, the temperature of complete\r\nsolidification for all solutions is a eutectic point.\r\n\r\nThe third type of curve, Fig. 65, can be distinguished in a similar manner\r\nfrom the ordinary eutectic curve, Fig. 63, I., to which it bears a certain\r\nresemblance. Whereas in the case of the latter, the eutectic point is the\r\ntemperature of complete solidification of all solutions, the point of\r\nminimum temperature in the case of the formation of mixed crystals, is the\r\nsolidification point only of solutions having one particular composition;\r\nthat, namely, of the minimum point. For all other solutions, the\r\ntemperature of complete solidification is different. Whereas, also, in the\r\ncase of the simple eutectic curve, the solid which separates out from the\r\nsolutions represented by either curve remains the same throughout the whole\r\nextent of that curve, the composition of the mixed crystal varies with\r\nvariation of the composition of the liquid phase, and the relative\r\nproportions of the two components in the solid and the liquid phase are\r\nreversed on passing through the minimum.[290]\r\n\r\nIn a similar manner, type IV., Fig. 65, can be distinguished from type II.,\r\nFig. 64, by the fact that it does not exhibit a {212} eutectic point, and\r\nthat the composition of the solid phase undergoes continuous variation with\r\nvariation of the liquid phase on either side of the transition point.\r\nLastly, type V., which does exhibit a eutectic point, differs from the\r\neutectic curve of Fig. 63, in that the eutectic point does not constitute\r\nthe point of complete solidification for all solutions, and that the\r\ncomposition of the solid phase varies with the composition of the liquid\r\nphase.\r\n\r\nSuch, then, are the chief general types of equilibrium curves for\r\ntwo-components; they are the pattern curves with which other curves,\r\nexperimentally determined, can be compared; and from the comparison it will\r\nbe possible to draw conclusions as to the nature of the equilibria between\r\nthe two components under investigation.\r\n\r\n1. _Organic Compounds._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 66.]\r\n\r\nThe principles of the Phase Rule have been applied to the investigation of\r\nthe equilibria between organic compounds, and Figs. 66-69 reproduce some of\r\nthe results which have been obtained.[291]\r\n\r\n{213}\r\n\r\nFig. 66, the freezing point curve (curve of equilibrium) for\r\n_o_-nitrophenol and _p_-toluidine, shows a curve of the simplest type[292]\r\n(type I., Fig. 63), in which two branches meet at an eutectic point. The\r\nsolid phase in equilibrium with solutions represented by the left-hand\r\nbranch of the curve was _o_-nitrophenol (m.p. 44.1deg); that in equilibrium\r\nwith the solutions represented by the right-hand branch, was _p_-toluidine\r\n(m.p. 43.3deg). At the eutectic point (15.6deg), these two solid phases\r\ncould co-exist with the liquid phase. This equilibrium curve, therefore,\r\nshows that _o_-nitrophenol and _p_-toluidine do not combine with one\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nIn connection with this curve, attention may be called to the interesting\r\nfact that although the solid produced by cooling the liquid phase at the\r\neutectic point has a composition approximating to that of a compound of\r\nequimolecular proportions of the phenol and toluidine, and a constant\r\nmelting point, it is nevertheless a _mixture_. Although, as a rule, the\r\nconstituents of the eutectic mixture are not present in simple molecular\r\nproportions, there is no reason why they should not be so; and it is\r\ntherefore necessary to beware of assuming the formation of compounds in\r\nsuch cases.[293]\r\n\r\nFig. 67, on the other hand, indicates with perfect certainty the formation\r\nof a compound between phenol and [alpha]-naphthylamine.[294] (_Cf._ curve\r\nI., Fig. 64.)\r\n\r\nPhenol freezes at 40.4deg, but the addition of [alpha]-naphthylamine lowers\r\nthe freezing point as represented by the curve AC. At C (16.0deg) the\r\ncompound C_{6}H_{5}OH,C_{10}H_{7}NH_{2} is formed, and the system becomes\r\ninvariant. On increasing the amount of the amine, the temperature of\r\nequilibrium rises, the solid phase now being the compound. At D, the curve\r\npasses through a maximum (28.8deg), at which the solid and liquid phases\r\nhave the same composition. This is the melting point of the compound.\r\nFurther addition of the amine lowers the temperature of equilibrium, until\r\nat E solid [alpha]-naphthylamine separates out, and a second eutectic point\r\n(24.0deg) is obtained. BE is the {214} freezing-point curve of\r\n[alpha]-naphthylamine in presence of phenol, the freezing point of the pure\r\namine being 48.3deg.\r\n\r\nOn account of the great sluggishness with which the compound of phenol and\r\n[alpha]-naphthylamine crystallizes, it was found possible to follow the\r\nfreezing point curves of phenol and the amine to temperatures considerably\r\nbelow the eutectic points, as shown by the curves CF and EG.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 67.]\r\n\r\nPhenol can also combine with _p_-toluidine in equimolecular proportions;\r\nand this compound is of interest, from the fact that it exists in two\r\ncrystalline forms melting at 28.5deg and 30deg. Each of these forms now\r\nmust have its own equilibrium curve, and it was found that the intermediate\r\nportion of the freezing point curve was duplicated, as shown in Fig.\r\n68.[295]\r\n\r\n{215}\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 68.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 69.]\r\n\r\n{216}\r\n\r\nLastly, a curve is given, Fig. 69,[296] which corresponds with curve II.,\r\nFig. 64. Picric acid and benzene can form a compound, which, however, can\r\nexist only in contact with solutions _containing excess of benzene_. When\r\nthe temperature is raised, a point (K) is reached at which the compound\r\nmelts with separation of solid picric acid. The point, K, is, therefore, a\r\n_transition point_; analysis, however, showed that the composition of the\r\nsolution at this point is very nearly that of the compound\r\nC_{6}H_{2}(NO_{2})_{3}OH,C_{6}H_{6}, so that the melting point of the\r\ncompound can almost be reached. The fusion of the compound of benzene and\r\npicric acid with separation of the latter is analogous to the (partial)\r\nfusion of Glauber's salt with separation of anhydrous sodium sulphate.\r\n\r\n2. _Optically Active Substances._\r\n\r\nThe question as to whether a resolvable inactive body is a mixture of the\r\ntwo oppositely active constituents (a _dl_-mixture), or a racemic compound,\r\nis one which has given rise to considerable discussion during the past\r\ndecade; and several investigators have endeavoured to establish general\r\nrules by which the question could be decided. In the case of inactive\r\nliquids it is a matter of great difficulty to arrive at a certain\r\nconclusion as to whether one is dealing with a mixture or a compound, for\r\nin this case the usual physical methods give but a dubious answer; and\r\nalthough the existence of a racemate in the liquid state (in the case of\r\nconine) has been asserted,[297] most chemists incline to the belief that\r\nsuch a thing is improbable.\r\n\r\nEven in the case of crystalline substances, where the differences between\r\nthe various forms is greater, it was not always easy to discriminate\r\nbetween the _dl_-mixture and the racemic compound. The occurrence of\r\nhemihedral faces was considered by Pasteur to be a sufficient criterion for\r\nan optically active substance. It has, however, been found that hemihedry\r\nin crystals, although a frequent accompaniment of {217} optical activity,\r\nis by no means a necessary or constant expression of this property. Other\r\nrules, also, which were given, although in some cases reliable, were in\r\nother cases insufficient; and all were in so far unsatisfactory that they\r\nlacked a theoretical basis.\r\n\r\nWith the help of the Phase Rule, however, it is possible from a study of\r\nthe solubility or fusion curves of the optically active and inactive\r\nsubstances, to decide the nature of the inactive substance, at least under\r\ncertain conditions. On account of the interest and importance which these\r\ncompounds possess, a brief description of the application of the Phase Rule\r\nto the study of such substances will be given here;[298] the two optical\r\nantipodes being regarded as the two components.\r\n\r\nIn the present chapter we shall consider only the fusion curves, the\r\nsolubility curves being discussed in the next section on three-component\r\nsystems. The rules which are hereby obtained, have reference only to the\r\nnature of the inactive substance in the neighbourhood of the melting\r\npoints.\r\n\r\nI. _The inactive substance is a _dl_-mixture._\r\n\r\nIn this case the fusion curves will have the simple form shown in type I,\r\nFig. 63. A and B are the melting points of the two optical isomerides, and\r\nC the eutectic point at which the inactive mixture consisting of equal\r\namounts of d- and l-form melts. Owing to the similar effect of the one form\r\non the freezing point of the other, the figure is symmetrical. No example\r\nof this simple case has been investigated.\r\n\r\nII. _The two components form a racemic compound._\r\n\r\nIn this case there will be three melting point curves as in Fig. 64, type\r\nI. In this case also the figure must be symmetrical.\r\n\r\nExamples.--As examples of this, may be taken dimethyl tartrate and mandelic\r\nacid, the freezing point curves of which are given in Figs. 70 and 71.[299]\r\nAs can be seen, the curve for the racemic tartrate occupies a large part of\r\nthe diagram, {218} while that for racemic mandelic acid is much smaller. In\r\nthe case of dimethyldiacetyl tartrate, this middle portion is still less.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 70.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 71.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 72.]\r\n\r\nActive dimethyl tartrate melts at 43.3deg; racemic dimethyl tartrate at\r\n89.4deg. Active mandelic acid melts at 132.8deg; the racemic acid at\r\n118.0deg. In the one case, therefore, the racemic compound has a higher, in\r\nthe other a lower melting point than the active forms. {219}\r\n\r\nIn the case of partially racemic compounds (_i.e._ the compound of a\r\nracemate with an optically active substance) the type of curve will be the\r\nsame, but the figure will no longer be symmetrical. Such a curve has been\r\nfound in the case of the l-menthyl esters of d- and l-mandelic acid (Fig.\r\n72).[300] The freezing point of l-menthyl d-mandelate is 97.2deg, of\r\nl-menthyl l-mandelate 77.6deg, and of l-menthyl r-mandelate 83.7.deg It\r\nwill be observed that the summit of the curve for the partially racemic\r\nmandelate is very flat, indicating that the compound is largely dissociated\r\ninto its components at the temperature of fusion.\r\n\r\nIII. _The inactive substance is a pseudo-racemic mixed crystal._\r\n\r\nIn cases where the active components can form mixed crystals, the\r\nfreezing-point curve will exhibit one of the forms given in Fig. 65. The\r\ninactive mixed crystal containing 50 per cent. of the dextro and laevo\r\ncompound, is known as a pseudo-racemic mixed crystal.[301] So far, only\r\ncurves of the types I. and II. have been obtained.\r\n\r\nExamples.--The two active camphor oximes are of interest from the fact that\r\nthey form a continuous series of mixed crystals, _all of which have the\r\nsame melting point_. The curve which is obtained in this case is,\r\ntherefore, a straight line joining the melting points of the pure active\r\ncomponents; the melting point of the active isomerides and of the whole\r\nseries of mixed crystals being 118.8deg.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 73.]\r\n\r\nIn the case of the carvoximes mixed crystals are also formed, but the\r\nequilibrium curve in this case exhibits a maximum (Fig. 73). At this\r\nmaximum point the composition of the solid and of the liquid solution is\r\nthe same. Since the curve must be symmetrical, this maximum point must\r\noccur in the case of the solution containing 50 per cent. {220} of each\r\ncomponent, which will therefore be inactive. Further, this inactive mixed\r\ncrystal will melt and solidify at the same temperature, and behave,\r\ntherefore, like a chemical compound (p. 187). The melting point of the\r\nactive compounds is 72deg; that of the inactive pseudo-racemic mixed\r\ncrystal is 91.4deg.\r\n\r\nTransformations.--As has already been remarked, the conclusions which can\r\nbe drawn from the fusion curves regarding the nature of the inactive\r\nsubstances formed hold only for temperatures in the neighbourhood of the\r\nmelting points. At temperatures below the melting point transformation may\r\noccur; _e.g._ a racemate may break up into a _dl_-mixture, or a\r\npseudo-racemic mixed crystal may form a racemic compound. We shall at a\r\nlater point meet with examples of a racemic compound changing into a\r\n_dl_-mixture at a definite transition point; and the pseudo-racemic mixed\r\ncrystal of camphoroxime is an example of the second transformation.\r\nAlthough at temperatures in the neighbourhood of the melting point the two\r\nactive camphoroximes form only mixed crystals but no compound, a racemic\r\ncompound is formed at temperatures below 103deg. At this temperature the\r\ninactive pseudo-racemic mixed crystal changes into a racemic compound; and\r\nin the case of the other mixed crystals transformation to racemate and\r\n(excess of) active component also occurs, although at a lower temperature\r\nthan in the case of the inactive mixed crystal. Although this behaviour is\r\none of considerable importance, this brief reference to it must suffice\r\nhere.[302]\r\n\r\n3. _Alloys._\r\n\r\nOne of the most important classes of substances in the study of which the\r\nPhase Rule has been of very considerable importance, is that formed by the\r\nmixtures or compounds of metals with one another known as alloys. Although\r\nin the investigation of the nature of these bodies various methods are\r\nemployed, one of the most important is the determination of the character\r\nof the freezing-point curve; for from the form of this, valuable\r\ninformation can, as we have already learned, be {221} obtained regarding\r\nthe nature of the solid substances which separate out from the molten\r\nmixture.\r\n\r\nAlthough it is impossible here to discuss fully the experimental results\r\nand the oftentimes very complicated relationships which the study of the\r\nalloys has brought to light, a brief reference to these bodies will be\r\nadvisable on account both of the scientific interest and of the industrial\r\nimportance attaching to them.[303]\r\n\r\nWe have already seen that there are three chief types of freezing-point\r\ncurves in systems of two components, viz. those obtained when (1) the pure\r\ncomponents crystallize out from the molten mass; (2) the components form\r\none or more compounds; (3) the components form mixed crystals. In the case\r\nof the metals, representatives of these three classes are also found.\r\n\r\n1. _The components separate out in the pure state._\r\n\r\nIn this case the freezing-point curve is of the simple type, Fig. 63, I.\r\nSuch curves have been obtained in the case of a number of pairs of metals,\r\n_e.g._ zinc--cadmium, zinc--aluminium, copper--silver (Heycock and\r\nNeville), tin--zinc, bismuth--lead (Gautier), and in other cases. From\r\nmolten mixtures represented by one branch of the freezing-point curve one\r\nof the metals will be deposited; while from mixtures represented by the\r\nother branch, the other metal will separate out. At the eutectic point the\r\nmolten mass will solidify to a _heterogeneous mixture_ of the two metals,\r\nforming what is known as the _eutectic alloy_. Such an alloy, therefore,\r\nwill melt at a definite temperature lower than the melting point of either\r\nof the pure metals.\r\n\r\n{222}\r\n\r\nIn the following table are given the temperature and the composition of the\r\nliquid at the eutectic point, for three pairs of metals:--\r\n\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n                  | Temperature. |      Composition of liquid.\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  Zinc--cadmium   |   264.5deg   | 73.5 atoms per cent. of cadmium.\r\n  Zinc--aluminium |   380.5deg   | 11     \"      \"         aluminium.\r\n  Copper--silver  |   778deg     | 40     \"      \"         copper.\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe melting points of the pure metals are, zinc, 419deg; cadmium, 322deg;\r\nsilver, 960deg; copper, 1081deg; aluminium, 650deg.\r\n\r\n2. _The two metals can form one or more compounds._\r\n\r\nIn this case there will be obtained not only the freezing-point curves of\r\nthe pure metals, but each compound formed will have its own freezing-point\r\ncurve, exhibiting a point of maximum temperature, and ending on either side\r\nin an eutectic point. The simplest curve of this type will be obtained when\r\nonly one compound is formed, as is the case with mercury and thallium.[304]\r\nThis curve is represented in Fig. 74, where the summit of the intermediate\r\ncurve corresponds with a composition TlHg_{2}. Similar curves are also\r\ngiven by nickel and tin, by aluminium and silver, and by other metals, the\r\nformation of definite compounds between these pairs of metals being thereby\r\nindicated.[305]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 74.]\r\n\r\n{223}\r\n\r\nA curve belonging to the same type, but more complicated, is obtained with\r\ngold and aluminium;[306] in this case, several compounds are formed, some\r\nof which have a definite melting point, while others exhibit only a\r\ntransition point. The chief compound is AuAl_{2}, which has practically the\r\nsame melting point as pure gold.\r\n\r\n3. _The two metals form mixed crystals (solid solutions)._\r\n\r\nThe simplest case in which the metals crystallize out together is found in\r\nsilver and gold.[307] The freezing-point curve in this case is an almost\r\nstraight line joining the freezing points of the pure metals (_cf._ curve\r\nI., Fig. 65, p. 210). These two metals, therefore, can form an unbroken\r\nseries of mixed crystals.\r\n\r\nIn some cases, however, the two metals do not form an unbroken series of\r\nmixed crystals. In the case of zinc and silver,[308] for example, the\r\naddition of silver _raises_ the freezing point of the mixture, until a\r\ntransition point is reached. This corresponds with curve IV., Fig. 65.\r\nSilver and copper, and gold and copper, on the other hand, do not form\r\nunbroken series of mixed crystals, but the freezing-point curve exhibits an\r\neutectic point, as in curve V., Fig. 65.\r\n\r\nNot only may there be these three different types of curves, but there may\r\nalso be combinations of these. Thus the two metals may not only form\r\ncompounds, but one of the metals may not separate out in the pure state at\r\nall, but form mixed crystals. In this case the freezing point may rise (as\r\nin the case of silver and zinc), and one of the eutectic points will be\r\nabsent.\r\n\r\nIron-Carbon Alloys.--Of all the different binary alloys, probably the most\r\nimportant are those formed by iron and carbon: alloys consisting not of two\r\nmetals, but of a metal and a non-metal. On account of the importance of\r\nthese alloys, an attempt will be made to describe in brief some of the most\r\nimportant relationships met with.\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding to discuss the applications of the Phase Rule to the\r\nstudy of the iron-carbon alloys, however, the main {224} facts with which\r\nwe have to deal may be stated very briefly. With regard to the metal\r\nitself, it is known to exist in three different allotropic modifications,\r\ncalled [alpha]-, [beta]-, and [gamma]-ferrite respectively. Like the two\r\nmodifications of sulphur and of tin, these different forms exhibit\r\ntransition points at which the relative stability of the forms changes.\r\nThus the transition point for [alpha]- and [beta]-ferrite is about 780deg;\r\nand below this temperature the [alpha]- form, above it the [beta]- form is\r\nstable. For [beta]- and [gamma]-ferrite, the transition point is about\r\n870deg, the [gamma]- form being the stable modification above this\r\ntemperature.\r\n\r\nThe different modifications of iron also possess different properties.\r\nThus, [alpha]-ferrite is magnetic, but does not possess the power of\r\ndissolving carbon; [beta]-ferrite is non-magnetic, and likewise does not\r\ndissolve carbon; [gamma]-ferrite is also non-magnetic, but possesses the\r\npower of dissolving carbon, and of thus giving rise to solid solutions of\r\ncarbon in iron.\r\n\r\nVarious alloys of iron and carbon, also, have to be distinguished. First of\r\nall, there is _hard steel_, which contains varying amounts of carbon up to\r\n2 per cent. Microscopic examination shows that these mixtures are all\r\nhomogeneous; and they are therefore to be regarded as solid solutions of\r\ncarbon in iron ([gamma]-ferrite). To these solutions the name _martensite_\r\nhas been given. _Pearlite_ contains about 0.8 per cent. of carbon, and, on\r\nmicroscopic examination, is found to be a heterogeneous mixture. If heated\r\nabove 670deg, pearlite becomes homogeneous, and forms martensite. Lastly,\r\nthere is a definite compound of iron and carbon, iron carbide or\r\n_cementite_, having the formula Fe_{3}C.\r\n\r\nA short description may now be given of the application of the Phase Rule\r\nto the two-component system iron--carbon; and of the diagram showing how\r\nthe different systems are related, and with the help of which the behaviour\r\nof the different mixtures under given conditions can be predicted.\r\nAlthough, with regard to the main features of this diagram, the different\r\nareas to be mapped and the position of the frontier lines, there is general\r\nagreement; a final decision has not yet been reached with regard to the\r\ninterpretation to be put on all the curves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 75.]\r\n\r\nThe chief relationships met with in the case of the {225} iron-carbon\r\nalloys are represented graphically in Fig. 75.[309] The curve AC is the\r\nfreezing-point curve for iron,[310] BC the unknown freezing-point curve for\r\ngraphite. C is an eutectic point. Suppose, now, that we start with a\r\nmixture of iron and carbon, represented by the point _x_. On lowering the\r\ntemperature, a point, _y_, will be reached at which solid begins to\r\nseparate out. This solid phase, however, is not pure iron, but a solid\r\nsolution of carbon in iron, having the composition represented by _y'_ (cf.\r\np. 185). As the temperature continues to fall, the {226} composition of the\r\nliquid phase changes in the direction of _y_C, while the composition of the\r\nsolid which separates out changes in the direction _y'_D; and, finally,\r\nwhen the composition of the molten mass is that of the point C (4.3 per\r\ncent. of carbon), the whole mass solidifies to a heterogeneous mixture of\r\ntwo solid solutions, one of which is represented by D (containing 2 per\r\ncent. of carbon), while the other will consist practically of pure\r\ngraphite, and is not shown in the figure. The temperature of the eutectic\r\npoint is 1130deg.\r\n\r\nEven below the solidification point, however, changes can take place. As\r\nhas been said, the solid phase which finally separates out from the molten\r\nmass is a solid solution represented by the point D; and the curve DE\r\nrepresents the change in the composition of this solid solution with the\r\ntemperature. As indicated in the figure, DE forms a part of a curve\r\nrepresenting the mutual solubility of graphite in iron and iron in\r\ngraphite; the latter solutions, however, not being shown, as they would lie\r\nfar outside the diagram. As the temperature falls below 1130deg, more and\r\nmore graphite separates out, until at E, when the temperature is 1000deg,\r\nthe solid solution contains only 1.8 per cent. of carbon. At this\r\ntemperature cementite also begins to be formed, so that as the temperature\r\ncontinues to fall, separation of cementite (represented by the line E'F')\r\noccurs, and the composition of the solid solution undergoes alteration, as\r\nrepresented by the curve EF. Below the temperature of the point F (670deg)\r\nthe martensite becomes heterogeneous, and forms pearlite.\r\n\r\nFrom the above description, therefore, it follows that if we start with a\r\nmolten mixture of iron and carbon, the composition of which is represented\r\nby any point between D and C (from 2 to 4.3 per cent. of carbon), we shall\r\nobtain, on cooling the mass, first of all solid solutions, the composition\r\nof which will be represented by points on the line AD; that then, after the\r\nmass has completely solidified at 1130deg, further cooling will lead to a\r\nseparation of graphite and a change in the composition of the martensite\r\n(from 2 to 1.8 per cent. of carbon). On cooling below 1000deg, however, the\r\nmartensite and graphite will give rise to cementite and solid solutions\r\n{227} containing less carbon than before, until, at temperatures below\r\n670deg, we are left with a mixture of pearlite and cementite.\r\n\r\nWe have already said that iron consists in three allotropic modifications,\r\nthe regions of stability of which are separated by definite transition\r\npoints. The transition point for [alpha]- and [beta]-ferrite (780deg) is\r\nrepresented in Fig. 75 by the point H; and the transition point for [beta]-\r\nand [gamma]-ferrite (870deg) by the point I. Since neither the [alpha]- nor\r\nthe [beta]-ferrite dissolves carbon, the transition point will be\r\nunaffected by addition of carbon, and we therefore obtain the horizontal\r\ntransition curve HG. In the case of the [beta]- and [gamma]-ferrite,\r\nhowever, the latter dissolves carbon, and the transition point is\r\nconsequently affected by the amount of carbon present. This is shown by the\r\nline IG.\r\n\r\nIf a martensite containing less carbon than that represented by the point G\r\nis cooled down from a temperature of, say, 900deg, then when the\r\ntemperature has fallen to that, represented by a point on the curve IG,\r\n[beta]-ferrite will separate out, and, as the temperature falls, the\r\ncomposition of the solid solution will alter as represented by IG. On\r\npassing below the temperature of HG, the [beta]-ferrite will be converted\r\ninto [alpha]-ferrite, and, as the temperature falls, the latter will\r\nseparate out more and more, while the composition of the solid solution\r\nalters in the direction GF. On passing to still lower temperatures, the\r\nsolid solution at F (0.8 per cent. of carbon) breaks up into pearlite. If\r\nthe percentage of carbon in the original solid solution was between that\r\nrepresented by the points G and F, then, on cooling down, no\r\n[beta]-ferrite, but only [alpha]-ferrite would separate out.\r\n\r\nWe see, therefore, that when martensite is allowed to cool _slowly_, it\r\nyields a heterogeneous mixture either of ferrite and pearlite (when the\r\noriginal mixture contained up to 0.8 per cent. of carbon), or pearlite and\r\ncementite (when the original mixture contained between 0.8 and 2 per cent.\r\nof carbon). These heterogeneous mixtures constitute soft steels, or, when\r\nthe carbon content is low, wrought iron.\r\n\r\nThe case, however, is different if the solid solution of carbon in iron is\r\n_rapidly_ cooled (quenched) from a temperature above the curve IGFE to a\r\ntemperature below this {228} curve. In this case, the rapid cooling does\r\nnot allow time for the various changes which have been described to take\r\nplace; so that the homogeneous solid solution, on being rapidly cooled,\r\nremains homogeneous. In this way hard steel is obtained. By varying the\r\nrapidity of cooling, as is done in the tempering of steel, varying degrees\r\nof hardness can be obtained.\r\n\r\nThe interpretation of the curves given above is that due essentially to\r\nRoozeboom, who concluded from the experimental data that at temperatures\r\nbelow 1000deg the stable systems are martensite and cementite, or ferrite\r\nand cementite, graphite being labile. It has, however, been pointed out,\r\nmore especially by E. Heyn,[311] that this is not in harmony with the facts\r\nof metallurgy, which show that graphite is undoubtedly formed on slow\r\ncooling, and more especially when small quantities of silicon are present\r\nin the iron.[312] While, therefore, the relationships represented by Fig.\r\n75 are obtained under certain conditions (especially when manganese is\r\npresent), Heyn considers that all the curves in that figure, except ACB,\r\nrepresent _metastable_ systems--systems, therefore, akin to supercooled\r\nliquids. Rapid cooling will favour the production of the metastable systems\r\ncontaining cementite, and therefore give rise to relationships represented\r\nby Fig. 75; whereas slow cooling will lead to the stable system ferrite and\r\ngraphite. Presence of silicon tends to prevent, presence of manganese tends\r\nto assist, the production of the metastable systems.\r\n\r\nAlthough this view put forward by Heyn has not been conclusively proved, it\r\nmust be said that there is much evidence in its favour. Further\r\ninvestigation is, however, required before a final decision as to the\r\ninterpretation of the curves can be reached.\r\n\r\nDetermination of the Composition of Compounds, without Analysis.--Since the\r\nequilibrium between a solid and a liquid phase depends not only on the\r\ncomposition of the liquid (solution) but also on that of the solid, it is\r\nnecessary {229} to determine the composition of the latter. In some cases\r\nthis is easily effected by separating the solid from the liquid phase and\r\nanalyzing it. In other cases, however, this method is inapplicable, or is\r\naccompanied by difficulties, due either to the fact that the solid phase\r\nundergoes decomposition (_e.g._ when it contains a volatile constituent),\r\nor to the difficulty of completely separating the mother liquor; as, for\r\nexample, in the case of alloys. In all such cases, therefore, recourse must\r\nbe had to other methods.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, synthetic methods may be employed.[313] In this case we\r\nstart with a solution of the two components, to which a third substance is\r\nadded, which, however, does not enter into the solid phase.[314] We will\r\nassume that the initial solution contains _x_ gm. of A and _y_ gm. of B to\r\n1 gm. of C. After the solution has been cooled down to such a temperature\r\nthat solid substance separates out, a portion of the liquid phase is\r\nremoved with a pipette and analyzed. If, now, the composition of the\r\nsolution is such that there are _x'_ gm. of A and _y'_ gm. of B to 1 gm. of\r\nC., then the composition of the solid phase is _x_ - _x'_ gm. of A and _y_\r\n- _y'_ gm. of B. When _x_ = _x'_, the solid phase is pure B; when _y_ =\r\n_y'_, the solid phase is pure A.\r\n\r\nWe have assumed here that there is only one solid phase present, containing\r\nA and B. To make sure that the solid phase is not a solid solution in which\r\nA and B are present in the same ratio as in the liquid solution, a second\r\ndetermination of the composition must be made, with different initial and\r\nend concentrations. If the solid phase is a solid solution, the composition\r\nwill now be found different from that found previously.\r\n\r\nThe composition of the solid phase can, however, be determined in another\r\nmanner, viz. by studying the fusion curve and the curve of cooling. From\r\nthe form of the fusion curve alone, it is possible to decide whether the\r\ntwo components {230} form a compound or not; and if the compounds which may\r\nbe formed have a definite melting point, the position of the latter gives\r\nat once the composition of the compounds (cf. p. 231).\r\n\r\nThis method, however, cannot be applied when the compounds undergo\r\ndecomposition before the melting point is reached. In such cases, however,\r\nthe form of the cooling curve enables one to decide the composition of the\r\nsolid phase.[315] If a solution is allowed to cool slowly, and the\r\ntemperature noted at definite times, the graphic representation of the rate\r\nof cooling will give a continuous curve; _e.g._ _ab_ in Fig. 76. So soon,\r\nhowever, as a solid phase begins to be formed, the rate of cooling alters\r\nabruptly, and the cooling curve then exhibits a break, or change in\r\ndirection (point _b_). When the eutectic point is reached, the temperature\r\nremains constant, until all the liquid has solidified. This is represented\r\nby the line _cd_. When complete solidification has occurred, the fall of\r\ntemperature again becomes uniform (_de_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 76.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 77.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 78.]\r\n\r\nThe length of time during which the temperature remains constant at the\r\npoint _c_, depends, of course, on the eutectic solution. If, therefore, we\r\ntake equal amounts of solution having a different initial composition, the\r\nperiod of constant temperature in the cooling curve will evidently be\r\ngreatest in the case of the solution having the composition of the eutectic\r\npoint; and the period will become less and less as we increase the amount\r\nof one of the components. The relationship between initial composition of\r\nsolution and the duration of constant temperature at the eutectic point is\r\nrepresented by the curve _a'c'b'_ (Fig. 77). When a compound possessing a\r\ndefinite melting point is formed, it behaves as a pure substance. If,\r\ntherefore, the initial composition of the {231} solution is the same as\r\nthat of the compound, no eutectic solution will be obtained; and therefore\r\nno line of constant temperature, such as _cd_ (Fig. 76). In such a case, if\r\nwe represent graphically the relation between the initial composition of\r\nthe solution and the duration of constant temperature, a diagram is\r\nobtained such as shown in Fig. 78. The two maxima on the time-composition\r\ncurve represent eutectic points, and the minima, _a'_, _b'_, _e'_, pure\r\nsubstances. The position of _e'_ gives the composition of the compound.\r\nWhen a series of compounds is formed, then for each compound a minimum is\r\nfound on the time-composition curve.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 79.]\r\n\r\nIf the compound formed has no definite melting point, the diagram obtained\r\nis like that shown in Fig. 79. If we start with a solution, the composition\r\nof which is represented by a point between _d_ and _b_, then, on cooling,\r\n_b_ will separate out first, and the temperature will fall until the point\r\n_d_ is reached. The temperature then remains constant until the component\r\n_b_, which has separated out, is converted into the compound. After this\r\nthe temperature again falls, until it again remains constant at the\r\neutectic point c. In the case of the first halt, the period of constant\r\ntemperature is greatest when the initial composition of the solution is the\r\nsame as that of the compound; and it becomes shorter and shorter with {232}\r\nincrease in the amount of either component. In this way we obtain the\r\ntime-composition curve _b'e\"d'_, of which the maximum point _e\"_ gives the\r\ncomposition of the compound.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the period of constant temperature for the eutectic\r\npoint _c_ is greatest in the case of solutions having the same initial\r\n_composition_ as that corresponding with the eutectic point; and it\r\ndecreases the more the initial composition approaches that of the pure\r\ncomponent _a_ or the component e. In this way we obtain the\r\ntime-composition curve _a'c'e'_. Here also the point _e'_ represents the\r\ncomposition of the compound. We see, therefore, that from the graphic\r\nrepresentation of the freezing-point curve, and from the duration of the\r\ntemperature-arrests on the cooling curve, for solutions of different\r\ninitial composition, it is possible, without having recourse to analysis,\r\nto decide what solid phases are formed, and what is their composition.\r\n\r\nFormation of Minerals.--Important and interesting as is the application of\r\nthe Phase Rule to the study of alloys, its application to the study of the\r\nconditions regulating the formation of minerals is no less so; and although\r\nwe do not propose to consider different cases in detail here, still\r\nattention must be drawn to certain points connected with this interesting\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, it will be evident from what has already been said,\r\nthat that mineral which first crystallizes out from a molten magma is not\r\nnecessarily the one with the highest melting point. The _composition_ of\r\nthe fused mass must be taken into account. When the system consists of two\r\ncomponents which do not form a compound, one or other of these will\r\nseparate out in a pure state, according as the composition of the molten\r\nmass lies on one or other side of the eutectic composition; and the\r\nseparation of the one component will continue until the composition of the\r\neutectic point is reached. Further cooling will then lead to the\r\nsimultaneous separation of the two components.\r\n\r\nIf, however, the two components form a stable compound (_e.g._ orthoclase,\r\nfrom a fused mixture of silica and potassium aluminate), then the\r\nfreezing-point curve will resemble that {233} shown in Fig. 64; _i.e._\r\nthere will be a middle curve possessing a dystectic point, and ending on\r\neither side at a eutectic point. This curve would represent the conditions\r\nunder which orthoclase is in equilibrium with the molten magma. If the\r\ninitial composition of the magma is represented by a point between the two\r\neutectic points, orthoclase will separate first. The composition of the\r\nmagma will thereby change, and the mass will finally solidify to a mixture\r\nof orthoclase and silica, or orthoclase and potassium aluminate, according\r\nto the initial composition.\r\n\r\nWhat has just been said holds, however, only for stable equilibria, and it\r\nmust not be forgotten that complications can arise owing to suspended\r\ntransformation (when, for example, the magma is rapidly cooled) and the\r\nproduction of metastable equilibria. These conditions occur very frequently\r\nin nature.\r\n\r\nThe study of the formation of minerals from the point of view of the Phase\r\nRule is still in its initial stages, but the results which have already\r\nbeen obtained give promise of a rich harvest in the future.[316]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{234}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nSYSTEMS OF THREE COMPONENTS\r\n\r\nGeneral.--It has already been made evident that an increase in the number\r\nof the components from one to two gives rise to a considerable increase in\r\nthe possible number of systems, and introduces not a few complications into\r\nthe equilibrium relations of these. No less is this the case when the\r\nnumber of components increases from two to three; and although examples of\r\nall the possible types of systems of three components have not been\r\ninvestigated, nor, indeed, any one type fully, nevertheless, among the\r\nsystems which have been studied experimentally, cases occur which not only\r\npossess a high scientific interest, but are also of great industrial\r\nimportance. On account not only of the number, but more especially of the\r\ncomplexity of the systems constituted of three components, no attempt will\r\nbe made to give a full account, or, indeed, even a survey of all the cases\r\nwhich have been subjected to a more or less complete experimental\r\ninvestigation; on the contrary, only a few of the more important classes\r\nwill be selected, and the most important points in connection with the\r\nbehaviour of these described.\r\n\r\nOn applying the Phase Rule\r\n\r\n  P + F = C + 2\r\n\r\nto the systems of three components, we see that in order that the system\r\nshall be invariant, no fewer than five phases must be present together, and\r\nan invariant system will therefore exist at a _quintuple_ point. Since the\r\nnumber of liquid phases can never exceed the number of the components, and\r\nsince there can be only one vapour phase, it is evident that in this case,\r\n{235} as in others, there must always be at least one solid phase present\r\nat the quintuple point. As the number of phases diminishes, the variability\r\nof the system can increase from one to four, so that in the last case the\r\ncondition of the system will not be completely defined until not only the\r\ntemperature and the total pressure of the system, but also the\r\nconcentrations of two of the components have been fixed. Or, instead of the\r\nconcentrations, the partial pressures of the components may also be taken\r\nas independent variables.\r\n\r\nGraphic Representation.--Hitherto the concentrations of the components have\r\nbeen represented by means of rectangular co-ordinates, although the\r\nnumerical relationships have been expressed in two different ways. In the\r\none case, the concentration of the one component was expressed in terms of\r\na fixed amount of the other component. Thus, the solubility of a salt was\r\nexpressed by the number of grams of salt dissolved by 100 grams of water or\r\nother solvent; and the numbers so obtained were measured along one of the\r\nco-ordinates. The second co-ordinate was then employed to indicate the\r\nchange of another independent variable, _e.g._ temperature. In the other\r\ncase, the combined weights of the two components A and B were put equal to\r\nunity, and the concentration of the one expressed as a fraction of the\r\nwhole amount. This method allows of the representation of the complete\r\nseries of concentrations, from pure A to pure B, and was employed, for\r\nexample, in the graphic representation of the freezing point curves.\r\n\r\nEven in the case of three components rectangular co-ordinates can also be\r\nemployed, and, indeed, are the most convenient in those cases where the\r\nbehaviour of two of the components to one another is very different from\r\ntheir behaviour to the third component; as, for example, in the case of two\r\nsalts and water. In these cases, the composition of the system can be\r\nrepresented by measuring the amounts of each of the two components in a\r\ngiven weight of the third, along two co-ordinates at right angles to one\r\nanother; and the change of the system with the temperature can then be\r\nrepresented by a third axis at right angles to the first two. In those\r\ncases, {236} however, where the three components behave in much the same\r\nmanner towards one another, the rectangular co-ordinates are not at all\r\nsuitable, and instead of these a _triangular diagram_ is employed. Various\r\nmethods have been proposed for the graphic representation of systems of\r\nthree components by means of a triangle, but only two of these have been\r\nemployed to any considerable extent; and a short description of these two\r\nmethods will therefore suffice.[317]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 80.]\r\n\r\nIn the method proposed by Gibbs an equilateral triangle of unit height is\r\nused (Fig 80).[318] The quantities of the different components are\r\nexpressed as fractional parts of the whole, and the sum of their\r\nconcentrations is therefore equal to unity, and can be represented by the\r\nheight of the triangle. The corners {237} of the triangle represent the\r\npure substances A, B, and C respectively. A point on one of the sides of\r\nthe triangle will give the composition of a mixture in which only two\r\ncomponents are present, while a point within the triangle will represent\r\nthe composition of a ternary mixture. Since every point within the triangle\r\nhas the property that the sum of the perpendiculars from that point on the\r\nsides of the triangle is equal to unity (the height of the triangle), it is\r\nevident that the composition of a ternary mixture can be represented by\r\nfixing a point within the triangle such that the lengths of the\r\n_perpendiculars_ from the point to the sides of the triangle are equal\r\nrespectively to the fractional amounts of the three components present; the\r\nfractional amount of A, B, or C being represented by the perpendicular\r\ndistance from the side of the triangle _opposite_ the corners A, B, and C\r\nrespectively.\r\n\r\nThe location of this point is simplified by dividing the normals from each\r\nof the corners on the opposite side into ten or one hundred parts, and\r\ndrawing through these divisions lines at right angles to the normal and\r\nparallel to the side of the triangle. A network of rhombohedra is thus\r\nobtained, and the position of any point can be read off in practically the\r\nsame manner as in the case of rectangular co-ordinates. Thus the point P in\r\nFig. 80 represents a ternary mixture of the composition A = 0.5, B = 0.3, C\r\n= 0.2; the perpendiculars P_a_, P_b_, and P_c_ being equal respectively to\r\n0.5, 0.2, and 0.3 of the height of the triangle.\r\n\r\nAnother method of representation, due to Roozeboom, consists in employing\r\nan equilateral triangle, the length of whose _side_ is made equal to unity,\r\nor one hundred; the sum of the fractional or percentage amounts of the\r\nthree components being represented therefore by a side of the triangle. In\r\nthis case the composition of a ternary mixture is obtained by determining,\r\nnot the _perpendicular_ distance of a point P from the three sides of the\r\ntriangle, but the distance in a direction _parallel_ to the sides of the\r\ntriangle (Fig. 81). Conversely, in order to represent a mixture consisting\r\nof _a_, _b_, and _c_ parts of the components A, B, and C respectively, one\r\nside of the triangle, say AB, is first of all divided into ten or one {238}\r\nhundred parts; a portion, B_x_ = _a_, is then measured off, and represents\r\nthe amount of A present. Similarly, a portion, A_x'_ = _b_, is measured off\r\nand represents the fractional amount of B, while the remainder, _xx'_ =\r\n_c_, represents the amount of C. From _x_ and _x'_ lines are drawn parallel\r\nto the sides of the triangle, and the point of intersection, P, represents\r\nthe composition of the ternary mixture of given composition; for, as is\r\nevident from the figure, the distance of the point P from the three sides\r\nof the triangle, when measured in directions _parallel_ to the sides, is\r\nequal to _a_, _b_, and _c_ respectively. From the division marks on the\r\nside AB, it is seen that the point P in this figure also represents a\r\nmixture of 0.5 parts of A, 0.2 parts of B, and 0.3 parts of C. This gives\r\nexactly the same result as the previous method. The employment of a\r\nright-angled isosceles triangle has also been suggested,[319] but is not in\r\ngeneral use.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 81.]\r\n\r\nIn employing the triangular diagram, it will be of use to note a property\r\nof the equilateral triangle. A line drawn from one corner of the triangle\r\nto the opposite side, represents the composition of all mixtures in which\r\nthe _relative_ amounts of two of the components remain unchanged. Thus, as\r\nFig. 82 shows, if the component C is added to a mixture x, in which A and B\r\nare present in the proportions of _a_ : _b_, a mixture _x'_, which is\r\nthereby obtained, also contains A and B in the ratio _a_ : b. For the two\r\ntriangles AC_x_ and BC_x_ are similar to the two triangles HC_x'_ and\r\nKC_x'_; and, {239} therefore, A_x_ : B_x_ = H_x'_ : K_x'_. But A_x_ = D_x_\r\nand B_x_ = E_x_; further H_x'_ = F_x'_ and K_x'_ = G_x'_. Therefore, D_x_ :\r\nE_x_ = F_x'_ : G_x'_ = _b_ : a. At all points on the line C_x_, therefore,\r\nthe ratio of A to B is the same.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 82.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 83.]\r\n\r\nIf it is desired to represent at the same time the change of another\r\nindependent variable, _e.g._ temperature, this can be done by measuring the\r\nlatter along axes drawn perpendicular to the corners of the triangle. In\r\nthis way a right prism (Fig. 83) is obtained, and each section of this cut\r\nparallel to the base represents therefore an _isothermal surface_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{240}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nSOLUTIONS OF LIQUIDS IN LIQUIDS\r\n\r\nWe have already seen (p. 95) that when two liquids are brought together,\r\nthey may mix in all proportions and form one homogeneous liquid phase; or,\r\nonly partial miscibility may occur, and two phases be formed consisting of\r\ntwo mutually saturated solutions. In the latter case, the concentration of\r\nthe components in either phase and also the vapour pressure of the system\r\nhad, at a given temperature, perfectly definite values. In the case of\r\nthree liquid components, a similar behaviour may be found, although\r\ncomplete miscibility of three components with the formation of only one\r\nliquid phase is of much rarer occurrence than in the case of two\r\ncomponents. When only partial miscibility occurs, various cases are met\r\nwith according as the three components form one, two, or three pairs of\r\npartially miscible liquids. Further, when two of the components are only\r\npartially miscible, the addition of the third may cause either an increase\r\nor a diminution in the mutual solubility of these. An increase in the\r\nmutual solubility is generally found when the third component dissolves\r\nreadily in each of the other two; but when the third component dissolves\r\nonly sparingly in the other two, its addition diminishes the mutual\r\nsolubility of the latter.\r\n\r\nWe shall consider here only a few examples illustrating the three chief\r\ncases which can occur, viz. (1) A and B, and also B and C are miscible in\r\nall proportions, while A and C are only partially miscible. (2) A and B are\r\nmiscible in all proportions, but A and C and B and C are only partially\r\nmiscible. (3) A and B, B and C, and A and C are only partially miscible. A,\r\nB, and C here represent the three components.\r\n\r\n1.--_The three components form only one pair of partially miscible\r\nliquids._ {241}\r\n\r\nAn example of this is found in the three substances: chloroform, water, and\r\nacetic acid.[320] Chloroform and acetic acid, and water and acetic acid,\r\nare miscible with one another in all proportions, but chloroform and water\r\nare only partially miscible with one another. If, therefore, chloroform is\r\nshaken with a larger quantity of water than it can dissolve, two layers\r\nwill be formed consisting one of a saturated solution of water in\r\nchloroform, the other of a saturated solution of chloroform in water. The\r\ncomposition of these two solutions at a temperature of about 18deg, will be\r\nrepresented by the points _a_ and _b_ in Fig. 84; _a_ representing a\r\nsolution of the composition: chloroform, 99 per cent.; water, 1 per cent.;\r\nand _b_ a solution of the composition: chloroform, 0.8 per cent.; water,\r\n99.2 per cent. When acetic acid is added, it distributes itself between the\r\ntwo liquid layers, and two conjugate _ternary_ solutions, consisting of\r\nchloroform, water, and acetic acid are thereby produced which are in\r\nequilibrium with one another, and the composition of which will be\r\nrepresented by two points inside the triangle. In this way a series of\r\npairs of ternary solutions will be obtained by the addition of acetic acid\r\nto the mixture of chloroform and water. By this addition, also, not only do\r\nthe two liquid phases become increasingly rich in acetic acid, but the\r\nmutual solubility of the chloroform and water increases; so that the layer\r\n_a_ becomes relatively richer in water, and layer _b_ relatively richer in\r\nchloroform. This is seen from the following table, which gives the\r\npercentage composition of different conjugate ternary solutions at 18deg.\r\n\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n             Heavier layer.           |            Lighter layer.\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  Chloroform. | Water. | Acetic acid. | Chloroform. | Water. | Acetic acid.\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n     99.01    |  0.99  |     0        |     0.84    | 99.16  |     0\r\n     91.85    |  1.38  |     6.77     |     1.21    | 73.69  |    25.10\r\n     80.00    |  2.28  |    17.72     |     7.30    | 48.58  |    44.12\r\n     70.13    |  4.12  |    25.75     |    15.11    | 34.71  |    50.18\r\n     67.15    |  5.20  |    27.65     |    18.33    | 31.11  |    50.56\r\n     59.99    |  7.93  |    32.08     |    25.20    | 25.39  |    49.41\r\n     55.81    |  9.58  |    34.61     |    28.85    | 23.28  |    47.87\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n{242}\r\n\r\nBy the continued addition of acetic acid, the composition of the successive\r\nconjugate solutions in equilibrium with one another becomes, as the table\r\nshows, more nearly the same, and a point is at length reached at which the\r\ntwo solutions become identical. This will therefore be a _critical point_\r\n(p. 98). Increased addition of acetic acid beyond this point will lead to a\r\nsingle homogeneous solution.\r\n\r\nThese relationships are represented graphically by the curve _a_K_b_, Fig.\r\n84. The points on the branch _a_K represent the composition of the\r\nsolutions relatively rich in chloroform (heavier layer), those on the curve\r\n_b_K the composition of solutions relatively rich in water (lighter layer);\r\nand the points on these two branches representing conjugate solutions are\r\njoined together by \"tie-lines.\" Thus, the points _a'b'_ represent conjugate\r\nsolutions, and the line _a'b'_ is a tie-line.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 84.]\r\n\r\nSince, now, acetic acid when added to a heterogeneous mixture of chloroform\r\nand water does not enter in equal amounts into the two layers, but in\r\namounts depending on its coefficient of distribution between chloroform and\r\nwater,[321] the {243} tie-lines will not be parallel to AB, but will be\r\ninclined at an angle. As the solutions become more nearly the same, the\r\ntie-lines diminish in length, and at last, when the conjugate solutions\r\nbecome identical, shrink to a point. For the reason that the tie-lines are,\r\nin general, not parallel to the side of the triangle, the critical point at\r\nwhich the tie-line vanishes will not be at the summit of the curve, but\r\nsomewhere below this, as represented by the point K.\r\n\r\nThe curve _a_K_b_, further, forms the boundary between the heterogeneous\r\nand homogeneous systems. A mixture of chloroform, water, and acetic acid\r\nrepresented by any point outside the curve _a_K_b_, will form only one\r\nhomogeneous phase; while any mixture represented by a point within the\r\ncurve, will separate into two layers having the composition represented by\r\nthe ends of the tie-line passing through that point. Thus, a mixture of the\r\ntotal composition _x_, will separate into two layers having the composition\r\n_a'_ and _b'_ respectively.\r\n\r\nSince three components existing in three phases (two liquid and a vapour\r\nphase) constitute a bivariant system, the final result, _i.e._ the\r\ncomposition of the two layers and the total vapour pressure, will not\r\ndepend merely on the temperature, as in the case of two-component systems\r\n(p. 102), but also on the composition of the mixture with which we start.\r\nAt constant temperature, however, all mixtures, the composition of which is\r\nrepresented by a point on one and the same tie-line, will separate into the\r\nsame two liquid phases, although the relative _amounts_ of the two phases\r\nwill vary. If we omit the vapour phase, the condition of the system will\r\ndepend on the pressure as well as on the temperature and composition of the\r\ninitial mixture. By keeping the pressure constant, _e.g._ at atmospheric\r\npressure (by working with open vessels), the system again becomes\r\nbivariant. We see, therefore, that the position of the curve _a_K_b_, or,\r\nin other words, the composition of the different conjugate ternary\r\nsolutions, will vary with the temperature, and only with the temperature,\r\nif we assume either constancy of pressure or the presence of the vapour\r\nphase. Since at the critical point the condition is imposed that the two\r\nliquid phases become identical, one degree of freedom is thereby {244}\r\nlost, and therefore only one degree of freedom remains. The critical point,\r\ntherefore, depends on the temperature, and only on the temperature; always\r\non the assumption, of course, that the pressure is constant, or that a\r\nvapour phase is present. Fig. 84, therefore, represents an isothermal\r\n(p. 239).\r\n\r\nIt is of importance to note that the composition of the different ternary\r\nsolutions obtained by the addition of acetic acid to a heterogeneous\r\nmixture of chloroform and water, will depend not only on the amount of\r\nacetic acid added, but also on the relative amounts of chloroform and water\r\nat the commencement. Suppose, for example, that we start with chloroform\r\nand water in the proportions represented by the point _c'_ (Fig. 84). On\r\nmixing these, two liquid layers having the composition _a_ and _b_\r\nrespectively will be formed. Since by the addition of acetic acid the\r\nrelative amounts of these two substances in the system as a whole cannot\r\nundergo alteration, the total composition of the different ternary systems\r\nwhich will be obtained must be represented by a point on the line C_c'_\r\n(p. 238). Thus, for example, by the addition of acetic acid a system may be\r\nobtained, the total composition of which is represented by the point _c\"_.\r\nSuch a system, however, will separate into two conjugate ternary solutions,\r\nthe composition of which will be represented by the ends of the tie-line\r\npassing through the point _c\"_. So long as the total composition of the\r\nsystem lies below the point S, _i.e._ the point of intersection of the line\r\nC_c'_ with the boundary curve, two liquid layers will be formed; while all\r\nsystems having a total composition represented by a point on the line\r\nC_c'_, above S, will form only one homogeneous solution.\r\n\r\nFrom the figure, also, it is evident that as the amount of acetic acid is\r\nincreased, the relative amounts of the two liquid layers formed differ more\r\nand more until at S a limiting position is reached, when the amount of the\r\none liquid layer dwindles to nought, and only one solution remains.\r\n\r\nThe same reasoning can be carried through for different initial amounts of\r\nchloroform and water, but it would be fruitless to discuss all the\r\ndifferent systems which can be obtained. The reason for the preceding\r\ndiscussion was to show that {245} although the addition of acetic acid to a\r\nmixture of chloroform and water will, in all cases, lead ultimately to a\r\nlimiting system, beyond which homogeneity occurs, that point is not\r\nnecessarily the critical point. On the contrary, in order that addition of\r\nacetic acid shall lead to the critical mixture, it is necessary to start\r\nwith a binary mixture of chloroform and water in the proportions\r\nrepresented by the point _c'_. In this case, addition of acetic acid will\r\ngive rise to a series of conjugate ternary solutions, the composition of\r\nwhich will gradually approach to one another, and at last become identical.\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing it will be evident that the amount of acetic acid\r\nrequired to produce a homogenous solution, will depend on the relative\r\namounts of chloroform and water from which we start, and can be ascertained\r\nby joining the corner C with the point on the line AB representing the\r\ntotal composition of the initial binary system. The point where this line\r\nintersects the boundary curve _a_K_b_ will indicate the minimum amount of\r\nacetic acid which, under these particular conditions, is necessary to give\r\none homogeneous solution.\r\n\r\nRetrograde Solubility.--As a consequence of the fact that acetic acid\r\ndistributes itself unequally between chloroform and water, and the critical\r\npoint K, therefore, does not lie at the summit of the curve, it is possible\r\nto start with a homogeneous solution in which the percentage amount of\r\nacetic acid is greater than at the critical point, and to pass from this\r\nfirst to a heterogenous and then again to a homogenous system merely by\r\naltering the relative amounts of chloroform and water. This phenomenon, to\r\nwhich the term _retrograde solubility_ is applied, will be observed not\r\nonly in the case of chloroform, water, and acetic acid, but in all other\r\nsystems in which the critical point lies below the highest point of the\r\nboundary curve for heterogeneous systems. This will be seen from the\r\ndiagram, Fig. 85. Starting with the homogeneous system represented by _x_,\r\nin which, therefore, the concentration of C is greater than in the critical\r\nmixture (K), if the relative amounts of A and B are altered in the\r\ndirection _xx'_, while the amount of C is maintained constant, the system\r\nwill become heterogeneous when the composition reaches the point _y_, and\r\nwill remain {246} heterogeneous with changing composition until the point\r\n_y'_ is passed, when it will again become homogeneous. If the relative\r\nconcentration of C is increased above that represented by the line SS, this\r\nphenomenon will, of course, no longer be observed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 85.]\r\n\r\nRelationships similar to those described for chloroform, water, and acetic\r\nacid are also found in the case of a number of other trios, _e.g._ ether,\r\nwater, and alcohol; chloroform, water, and alcohol.[322] They have also\r\nbeen observed in the case of a considerable number of molten metals.[323]\r\nThus, molten lead and silver, as well as molten zinc and silver, mix in all\r\nproportions; but molten lead and zinc are only partially miscible with one\r\nanother. When melted together, therefore, the last two metals will separate\r\ninto two liquid layers, one rich in lead, the other rich in zinc. If silver\r\nis now added, and the temperature maintained above the freezing point of\r\nthe mixture, the silver passes for the most part, in accordance with the\r\nlaw of distribution, into the upper layer, which is rich in zinc; silver\r\nbeing more soluble in molten zinc than in molten lead. This is clearly\r\nshown by the following figures:--[324]\r\n\r\n{247}\r\n\r\n  --------------------------------------------------\r\n       Heavier alloy.     |     Lighter alloy.\r\n  --------------------------------------------------\r\n    Percentage amount of  |  Percentage amount of\r\n  Silver. | Lead. | Zinc. | Silver. | Lead. | Zinc.\r\n  --------------------------------------------------\r\n    1.25  | 96.69 |  2.06 |  38.91  |  3.12 | 57.97\r\n    1.71  | 96.43 |  1.86 |  45.01  |  3.37 | 51.62\r\n    5.55  | 93.16 |  1.29 |  54.93  |  4.21 | 40.86\r\n  --------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe numbers in the same horizontal row give the composition of the\r\nconjugate alloys, and it is evident that the upper layer consists almost\r\nentirely of silver and zinc. On allowing the mixture to cool slightly, the\r\nupper layer solidifies first, and can be separated from the still molten\r\nlead layer. It is on this behaviour of silver towards a mixture of molten\r\nlead and zinc that the Parkes's method for the desilverization of lead\r\ndepends.[325] If aluminium is also added, a still larger proportion of\r\nsilver passes into the lighter layer, and the desilverization of the lead\r\nis more complete.[326]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 86.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 87.]\r\n\r\nThe Influence of Temperature.--As has already been said, a ternary system\r\nexisting in three phases possesses two degrees of freedom; and the state of\r\nthe system is therefore dependent not only on the relative concentration of\r\nthe components, but also on the temperature. As the temperature changes,\r\ntherefore, the boundary curve of the heterogeneous system will also alter;\r\nand in order to represent this alteration we shall make use of the right\r\nprism, in which the temperature is measured upwards. In this way the\r\nboundary curve passes into a boundary surface (called a dineric surface),\r\nas shown in Fig. 86. In this figure the curve _akb_ is the isothermal for\r\nthe ternary system; the curve _a_K_b_ shows the change in the _binary_\r\nsystem AB with the temperature, with {248} a critical point at K. This\r\ncurve has the same meaning as those given in Chapter VI. The curve _k_K is\r\na critical curve joining together the critical points of the different\r\nisothermals. In such a case as is shown in Fig. 86, there does not exist\r\nany real critical temperature for the ternary system, for as the\r\ntemperature is raised, the amount of C in the \"critical\" solution becomes\r\nless and less, and at K only two components, A and B, are present. In the\r\ncase, however, represented in Fig. 87, a real ternary critical point is\r\nfound. In this figure _ak'b_ is an isothermal, _ak\"_ is the curve for the\r\nbinary system, and K is the ternary critical point. All points outside the\r\nhelmet-shaped boundary surface represent homogeneous ternary solutions,\r\nwhile all points within the surface belong to heterogeneous systems. Above\r\nthe temperature of the point K, the three components are miscible in all\r\nproportions. An example of a ternary system yielding such a boundary\r\nsurface is that consisting of phenol, water, and acetone.[327] In this case\r\nthe critical temperature K is 92deg, and the composition at this ternary\r\ncritical point is--\r\n\r\n  Water   59 per cent.\r\n  Acetone 12    \"\r\n  Phenol  29    \"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 88.]\r\n\r\nThe difference between the two classes of systems just mentioned, is seen\r\nvery clearly by a glance at the Figs. 88 and 89, which show the projection\r\nof the isothermals on the base of the prism. In Fig. 88, the projections\r\nyield paraboloid curves, the two branches of which are cut by one side of\r\nthe triangle; and the critical point is represented by a point on {249}\r\nthis side. In the second case (Fig. 89), however, the projections of the\r\nisothermals form ellipsoidal curves surrounding the supreme critical point,\r\nwhich now lies _inside the triangle_. At lower temperatures, these\r\nisothermal boundary curves are cut by a side of the triangle; at the\r\ncritical temperature, _k\"_, of the binary system AB, the boundary curve\r\n_touches_ the side AB, while at still higher temperatures the boundary\r\ncurve comes to lie entirely within the triangle. At any given temperature,\r\ntherefore, between the critical point of the binary system (_k\"_), and the\r\nsupreme critical point of the ternary system (K), each pair of the three\r\ncomponents are miscible with one another in all proportions; for the region\r\nof heterogeneous systems is now bounded by a closed curve lying entirely\r\nwithin the triangle. Outside this curve only homogeneous systems are found.\r\nBinary mixtures, therefore, represented by any point on one of the sides of\r\nthe triangle must be homogeneous, for they all lie outside the boundary\r\ncurve for heterogeneous states.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 89.]\r\n\r\n2. _The three components can form two pairs of partially miscible liquids._\r\n\r\nIn the case of the three components water, alcohol, and succinic nitrile,\r\nwater and alcohol are miscible in all proportions, but not so water and\r\nsuccinic nitrile, or alcohol and succinic nitrile.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 90.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 91.]\r\n\r\nAs we have already seen (p. 122), water and succinic nitrile can form two\r\nliquid layers between the temperatures 18.5deg and 55.5deg; while alcohol\r\nand nitrile can form two liquid layers between 13deg and 31deg. If, then,\r\nbetween these two temperature limits, alcohol is added to a heterogeneous\r\nmixture of water and nitrile, or water is added to a mixture of alcohol and\r\nnitrile, two heterogeneous ternary systems will be formed, {250} and two\r\nboundary curves will be obtained in the triangular diagram, as shown in\r\nFig. 90.[328] On changing the temperature, the boundary curves will also\r\nundergo alteration, in a manner similar to that just discussed. As the\r\ntemperature falls, the two curves will spread out more and more into the\r\ncentre of the triangle, and might at last meet one another; while at still\r\nlower temperatures we may imagine the curves still further expanding so\r\nthat the two heterogeneous regions flow into one another and form a _band_\r\non the triangular diagram (Fig. 91). This, certainly, has not been realized\r\nin the case of the three components mentioned, because at a temperature\r\nhigher than that at which the two heterogeneous regions could fuse\r\ntogether, solid separates out.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 92.]\r\n\r\nThe gradual expansion of a paraboloid into a band-like area of\r\nheterogeneous ternary systems, has, however, been observed in the case of\r\nwater, phenol, and aniline.[329] In Fig. 92 are shown three isothermals,\r\nviz. those for 148deg, 95deg, and 50deg. At 148deg, water and aniline form\r\ntwo layers having the composition--\r\n\r\n  Water,   83.5 per cent. }     { water,   20 per cent.\r\n                          } and {\r\n  Aniline, 16.5    \"      }     { aniline, 80    \"\r\n\r\n{251}\r\n\r\nand the critical point _k'_ has the composition--\r\n\r\n  Water, 65; phenol, 13.2; aniline, 21.8 per cent.\r\n\r\nAt 95deg, the composition of the two binary solutions is--\r\n\r\n  Water,  93 per cent. }     { water     8 per cent.\r\n                       } and {\r\n  Aniline, 7    \"      }     { aniline, 92    \"\r\n\r\nwhile the point _k\"_ has the composition\r\n\r\n  Water, 69.9; phenol, 26.6; aniline, 3.5 per cent.\r\n\r\nAt 50deg, the region of heterogeneous states now forms a band, and the two\r\nlayers formed by water and aniline have the composition--\r\n\r\n  Water,  96.5 per cent. }     { water,    5.5 per cent.\r\n                         } and {\r\n  Aniline, 3.5    \"      }     { aniline, 94.5    \"\r\n\r\nwhile the two layers formed by water and phenol have the composition--\r\n\r\n  Water,  89 per cent.}     { water,  38 per cent.\r\n                      } and {\r\n  Phenol, 11    \"     }     { phenol, 62    \"\r\n\r\nAll mixtures of water, phenol, and aniline, therefore, the composition of\r\nwhich is represented by any point within the band _abcd_, will form two\r\nternary solutions; while if the composition is represented by a point\r\noutside the band, only one homogeneous solution will be produced.\r\n\r\n3. _The three components form three pairs of partially miscible liquids._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 93.]\r\n\r\nThe third chief case which can occur is that no two of the components are\r\ncompletely miscible with one another. In this case, therefore, we shall\r\nobtain three paraboloid boundary curves, as shown in Fig. 93. If, now, we\r\nimagine these three curves to expand in towards the centre of the triangle,\r\nas might happen, for example, by lowering the temperature, a point will\r\n{252} be reached at which the curves partly overlap, and we shall get the\r\nappearance shown in Fig. 94.\r\n\r\nThe points _a_, _b_, and _c_ represent the points where the three curves\r\ncut, and the triangle _abc_ is a region where the curves overlap. From this\r\ndiagram we can see that any mixture having a composition represented by a\r\npoint in one of the clear spaces at the corners of the larger triangle,\r\nwill form a homogeneous solution; if the composition corresponds to any\r\npoint lying in one of the quadrilateral regions _x__{1}, _x__{2} or\r\n_x__{3}, two ternary solutions will be formed; while, if the composition is\r\nrepresented by any point in the inner triangle, separation into three\r\nlayers will occur.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 94.]\r\n\r\nSince in the clear regions at the corners of the triangle we have three\r\ncomponents in two phases, liquid and vapour, the systems have three degrees\r\nof freedom. At constant temperature, therefore, the condition of the system\r\nis not defined until the concentrations of two of the components are fixed.\r\nA system belonging to one of the quadrilateral spaces has, as we have seen,\r\ntwo degrees of freedom; besides the temperature, one concentration must be\r\nfixed. Lastly, a system the composition of which falls within the inner\r\ntriangle _abc_, will form three layers, and will therefore possess only one\r\ndegree of freedom. If the temperature is fixed, the composition of the\r\nthree layers is also determined, viz. that of the points _a_, _b_, and _c_\r\nrespectively; and a change in the composition of the original mixture can\r\nlead only to a difference in the relative amounts of the three layers, not\r\nto a difference in their composition.\r\n\r\nAn example of a system which can form three liquid phases is found in\r\nwater, ether, and succinic nitrile.[330]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{253}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nPRESENCE OF SOLID PHASES\r\n\r\nA. The Ternary Eutectic Point.--In passing to the consideration of those\r\nternary systems in which one or more solid phases can exist together with\r\none liquid phase, we shall first discuss not the solubility curves, as in\r\nthe case of two-component systems, but the simpler relationships met with\r\nat the freezing point. That is, we shall first of all examine the freezing\r\npoint curves of ternary systems.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 95.]\r\n\r\nSince it is necessary to take into account not only the changing\r\ncomposition of the liquid phase, but also the variation of the temperature,\r\nwe shall employ the right prism for the graphic representation of the\r\nsystems, as shown in Fig. 95. A, B, and C in this figure, therefore, denote\r\nthe melting points of the pure components. If we start with the component A\r\nat its melting point, and add B, which is capable of dissolving in liquid\r\nA, the freezing point of A will be lowered; and, similarly, the freezing\r\npoint of B by addition of A. In this way we get the freezing point curve\r\nA_k__{1}B for the binary system; _k__{1}; being an eutectic point. This\r\ncurve will of course lie in the plane formed by one face of the prism. In a\r\nsimilar manner we obtain the freezing point curves A_k__{2}C and B_k__{3}C.\r\nThese curves give the composition of the binary liquid phases in\r\nequilibrium {254} with one of the pure components, or at the eutectic\r\npoints, with a mixture of two solid components. If, now, to the system\r\nrepresented say by the point _k__{1}, a small quantity of the third\r\ncomponent, C, is added, the temperature at which the two solid phases A and\r\nB can exist in equilibrium with the liquid phase is lowered; and this\r\ndepression of the eutectic point is all the greater the larger the addition\r\nof C. In this way we obtain the curve _k__{1}K, which slopes inwards and\r\ndownwards, and indicates the varying composition of the ternary liquid\r\nphase with which a mixture of solid A and B are in equilibrium. Similarly,\r\nthe curves _k__{2}K and _k__{3}K are the corresponding eutectic curves for\r\nA and C, and B and C in equilibrium with ternary solutions. At the point K,\r\nthe three solid components are in equilibrium with the liquid phase; and\r\nthis point, therefore, represents _the lowest temperature attainable with\r\nthe three components given_. Each of the ternary eutectic curves, as they\r\nmay be called, is produced by the intersection of two surfaces, while at\r\nthe ternary eutectic point, three surfaces, viz. A_k__{1}K_k__{2},\r\nB_k__{1}K_k__{3}, and C_k__{1}K_k__{3} intersect. Any point on one of these\r\nsurfaces represents a ternary solution in equilibrium with only one\r\ncomponent in the solid state; the lines or curves of intersection of these\r\nrepresent equilibria with two solid phases, while at the point K, the\r\nternary eutectic point, there are three solid phases in equilibrium with a\r\nliquid and a vapour phase. The surfaces just mentioned represent bivariant\r\nsystems. One component in the solid state can exist in equilibrium with a\r\nternary liquid phase under varying conditions of temperature and\r\nconcentration of the components in the solution; and before the state of\r\nthe system is defined, these two variables, temperature and composition of\r\nthe liquid phase, must be fixed. On the other hand, the curves formed by\r\nthe intersection of these planes represent univariant systems; at a given\r\ntemperature two solid phases can exist in equilibrium with a ternary\r\nsolution, only when the latter has a definite composition. Lastly, the\r\nternary eutectic point, K, represents an invariant system; three solid\r\nphases can exist in equilibrium with a ternary solution, only when the\r\nlatter has one fixed composition and when the temperature has a definite\r\nvalue. This eutectic point, therefore, {255} has a perfectly definite\r\nposition, depending only on the nature of the three components.\r\n\r\nInstead of employing the prism, the change in the composition of the\r\nternary solutions can also be indicated by means of the _projections_ of\r\nthe curves _k__{1}K, _k__{2}K, and _k__{3}K on the base of the prism, the\r\nparticular temperature being written beside the different eutectic points\r\nand curves. This is shown in Fig. 96.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 96.]\r\n\r\nThe numbers which are given in this diagram refer to the eutectic points\r\nfor the system bismuth--lead--tin, the data for which are as\r\nfollows:--[331]\r\n\r\n  --------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  Melting point of | Percentage composition of | Temperature of binary\r\n     pure  metal.  |  binary eutectic mixture. |    eutectic point.\r\n  --------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n                   |      Bi    Pb    Sn       |\r\n   Bismuth, 268deg |      55    45    --       |     Bi--Pb, 127deg\r\n   Lead, 325deg    |      58    --    42       |     Bi--Sn, 133deg\r\n   Tin, 232deg     |      --    37    63       |     Pb--Sn, 182deg\r\n  --------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n  --------------------------------------------------\r\n  Percentage composition of | Temperature of ternary\r\n  ternary eutectic mixture. |    eutectic point.\r\n  --------------------------------------------------\r\n       Bi    Pb    Sn       |\r\n       52    32    16       |         96deg\r\n  --------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nFormation of Compounds.--In the case just discussed, the components\r\ncrystallized out from solution in the pure state. If, however, combination\r\ncan take place between two of the components, the relationships will be\r\nsomewhat different; the curves which are obtained in such a case being\r\nrepresented in Fig. 97. From the figure, we see that the two components B\r\n{256} and C form a compound, and the freezing point curve of the binary\r\nsystem has therefore the form shown in Fig. 64 (p. 209). Further, there are\r\ntwo _ternary_ eutectic points, K_{1} and K_{2}, the solid phases present\r\nbeing A, B, and compound, and A, C, and compound respectively.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 97.]\r\n\r\nThe particular point, now, to which it is desired to draw attention is\r\nthis. Suppose the ternary eutectic curves projected on a plane parallel to\r\nthe face of the prism containing B and C, _i.e._ suppose the concentrations\r\nof the two components B and C, between which interaction can occur,\r\nexpressed in terms of a constant amount of the third component A,[332]\r\ncurves will then be obtained which are in every respect analogous to the\r\nfreezing point curves of binary systems. Thus, suppose the eutectic curves\r\n_k__{1}K and _k__{2}K in Fig. 95 projected on the face BC of the prism,\r\nthen evidently a curve will be obtained consisting of two branches\r\nmeeting in an eutectic point. On the other hand, the projection of the\r\nternary eutectic curves in Fig. 97 on the face BC of the prism, will\r\ngive a curve consisting of three portions, as shown by the outline\r\n_k__{1}K_{1}K_{2}_k__{2} in Fig. 97.\r\n\r\nVarious examples of this have been studied, and the following table\r\ncontains some of the data for the system ethylene bromide (A), picric acid\r\n(B), and [beta]-naphthol (C), obtained by Bruni.[333]\r\n\r\n{257}\r\n\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n                     | Temperature |            Solid phases present.\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  Point _k__{1}      |   9.41deg   | Ethylene bromide, picric acid.\r\n  Curve _k__{1}K_{1} |     --      |         \"               \"\r\n  Point K_{1}        |   9.32deg   | Ethylene bromide, picric acid, and\r\n                     |             |  [beta]-naphthol picrate.\r\n  Curve K_{1}D'K_{2} |     --      | Ethylene bromide,\r\n                     |             |               [beta]-naphthol picrate.\r\n  Point D'           |   9.75deg   |     \"       \"         \"        \"\r\n  Point K_{2}        |   8.89deg   |     \"       \"     [beta]-naphthol,\r\n                     |             |                           and picrate.\r\n  Curve K_{2}_k__{2} |     --      |     \"       \"     [beta]-naphthol.\r\n  Point _k__{2}      |   9.04deg   |     \"       \"               \"\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nFrom what has been said, it will be apparent that if the ternary eutectic\r\ncurve of a three-component system (in which one of the components is\r\npresent in constant amount) is determined, it will be possible to state,\r\nfrom the form of curve obtained, whether or not the two components present\r\nin varying amount crystallize out pure or combine with one another to form\r\na compound. It may be left to the reader to work out the curves for the\r\nother possible systems; but it will be apparent, that the projections of\r\nthe ternary eutectic curves in the manner given will yield a series of\r\ncurves alike in all points to the binary curves given in Figs. 63-65,\r\npp. 208-210.\r\n\r\nSince, from the method of investigation, the temperatures of the eutectic\r\ncurves will depend on the melting point of the third component (A), it is\r\npossible, by employing substances with widely differing melting points, to\r\ninvestigate the interaction of the two components (_e.g._ two optical\r\nantipodes) B and C over a range of temperature; and thus determine the\r\nrange of stability of the compound, if one is formed. Since, in some cases,\r\ntwo substances which at one temperature form mixed crystals combine at\r\nanother temperature to form a definite compound, the relationships which\r\nhave just been described can be employed, and indeed, have been employed,\r\nto determine the temperature at which this change occurs.[334] By means of\r\nthis method, Adriani found that below 103deg _i_-camphoroxime exists as a\r\nracemic compound, while above {258} that temperature it occurs as a racemic\r\nmixed crystal[335] (_cf._ p. 219).\r\n\r\nB. Equilibria at Higher Temperatures. Formation of Double Salts.--After\r\nhaving studied the relationships which are found in the neighbourhood of\r\nthe freezing points of the components, we now pass to the discussion of the\r\nequilibria which are met with at higher temperatures. In this connection we\r\nshall confine the discussion entirely to the systems formed of two salts\r\nand water, dealing more particularly with those cases in which the water is\r\npresent in relatively large amount and acts as solvent. Further, in\r\nstudying these systems, one restriction must be made, viz. that the single\r\nsalts are salts either of the same base or of the same acid; or are, in\r\nother words, capable of yielding a common ion in solution. Such a\r\nrestriction is necessary, because otherwise the system would be one not of\r\nthree but of four components.[336]\r\n\r\nTransition Point.--As is very well known, there exist a number of hydrated\r\nsalts which, on being heated, undergo apparent partial fusion; and in\r\nChapter V. the behaviour of such hydrates was more fully studied in the\r\nlight of the Phase Rule. Glauber's salt, or sodium sulphate decahydrate,\r\nfor example, on being heated to a temperature of about 32.5deg, partially\r\nliquefies, owing to the fact that the water of crystallization is split off\r\nand anhydrous sodium sulphate formed, as shown by the equation--\r\n\r\n  Na_{2}SO_{4},10H_{2}O = Na_{2}SO_{4} + 10H_{2}O\r\n\r\nThe temperature of 32.5deg, it was learned, constituted a _transition\r\npoint_ for the decahydrate and anhydrous salt plus water; decomposition of\r\nthe hydrated salt occurring above this temperature, combination of the\r\nanhydrous salt and water below it.\r\n\r\nAnalogous phenomena are met with in systems constituted of two salts and\r\nwater in which the formation of double salts can take place. Thus, for\r\nexample, if _d_-sodium potassium {259} tartrate is heated to above 55deg,\r\napparent partial fusion occurs, and the two single salts, _d_-sodium\r\ntartrate and _d_-potassium tartrate, are deposited, the change which occurs\r\nbeing represented by the equation--\r\n\r\n  4NaKC_{4}O_{6}H_{4},4H_{2}O = 2Na_{2}C_{4}O_{6}H_{4},2H_{2}O\r\n                              + 2K_{2}C_{4}O_{6}H_{4},1/2H_{2}O + 11H_{2}O\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if sodium and potassium tartrates are mixed with water\r\nin the proportions shown on the right side of the equation, the system will\r\nremain partially liquid so long as the temperature is maintained above\r\n55deg (in a closed vessel to prevent loss of water), but on allowing the\r\ntemperature to fall below this point, complete solidification will ensue,\r\nowing to the formation of the hydrated double salt. Below 55deg, therefore,\r\nthe hydrated double salt is the stable system, while above this temperature\r\nthe two single salts plus saturated solution are stable.[337]\r\n\r\nA similar behaviour is found in the case of the double salt copper\r\ndipotassium chloride (CuCl_{2},2KCl,2H_{2}O or CuK_{2}Cl_{4},2H_{2}O).[338]\r\nWhen this salt is heated to 92deg, partial liquefaction occurs, and the\r\noriginal blue plate-shaped crystals give place to brown crystalline needles\r\nand white cubes; while on allowing the temperature to fall, re-formation of\r\nthe blue double salt ensues. The temperature 92deg is, therefore, a\r\ntransition point at which the reversible reaction--\r\n\r\n  CuK_{2}Cl_{4},2H_{2}O <--> CuKCl_{3} + KCl + 2H_{2}O\r\n\r\ntakes place.\r\n\r\nThe decomposition of sodium potassium tartrate, or of copper dipotassium\r\nchloride, differs in so far from that of Glauber's salt that _two_ new\r\nsolid phases are formed; and in the case of copper dipotassium chloride,\r\none of the decomposition products is itself a double salt.\r\n\r\nIn the two examples of double salt decomposition which have just been\r\nmentioned, sufficient water was yielded to cause a partial liquefaction;\r\nbut other cases are known where this is not so. Thus, when copper calcium\r\nacetate is heated to a {260} temperature of 75deg, although decomposition\r\nof the double salt into the two single salts occurs as represented by the\r\nequation[339]--\r\n\r\n  CuCa(C_{2}H_{3}O_{2})_{4},8H_{2}O = Cu(C_{2}H_{3}O_{2})_{2},H_{2}O\r\n                                    + Ca(C_{2}H_{3}O_{2})_{2},H_{2}O\r\n                                    + 6H_{2}O\r\n\r\nthe amount of water split off is insufficient to give the appearance of\r\npartial fusion, and, therefore, only a change in the crystals is observed.\r\n\r\nThe preceding examples, in which decomposition of the double salt was\r\neffected by a rise of temperature, were chosen for first consideration as\r\nbeing more analogous to the case of Glauber's salt; but not a few examples\r\nare known where the reverse change takes place, formation of the double\r\nsalt occurring _above_ the transition point, and decomposition into the\r\nconstituent salts below it. Instances of this behaviour are found in the\r\ncase of the formation of astracanite from sodium and magnesium sulphates,\r\nand of sodium ammonium racemate from the two sodium ammonium tartrates, to\r\nwhich reference will be made later. Between these various systems, however,\r\nthere is no essential difference; and whether decomposition or formation of\r\nthe double salt occurs at temperatures above the transition point, will of\r\ncourse depend on the heat of change at that point. For, in accordance with\r\nvan't Hoff's law of movable equilibrium (p. 58), that change will take\r\nplace at the higher temperature which is accompanied by an absorption of\r\nheat. If, therefore, the formation of the double salt from the single salts\r\nis accompanied by an absorption of heat, the double salt will be formed\r\nfrom the single salts on raising the temperature; but if the reverse is the\r\ncase, then the double salt on being heated will decompose into the\r\nconstituent salts.[340]\r\n\r\nIn those cases, now, which have so far been studied, the change at the\r\ntransition point is accompanied by a taking up or a splitting off of water;\r\nand _in such cases the general rule can be given, that if the water of\r\ncrystallization of the two constituent {261} salts together is greater than\r\nthat of the double salt, the latter will be produced from the former on\r\nraising the temperature_ (_e.g._ astracanite from sodium and magnesium\r\nsulphates); _but if the double salt contains more water of crystallization\r\nthan the two single salts, increase of temperature will effect the\r\ndecomposition of the double salt_. When we seek for the connection between\r\nthis rule and the law of van't Hoff, it is found in the fact that the heat\r\neffect involved in the hydration or dehydration of the salts is much\r\ngreater than that of the other changes which occur, and determines,\r\ntherefore, the sign of the total heat effect.[341]\r\n\r\nVapour Pressure. Quintuple Point.--In the case of Glauber's salt, we saw\r\nthat at a certain temperature the vapour pressure curve of the hydrated\r\nsalt cut that of the saturated solution of anhydrous sodium sulphate. That\r\npoint, it will be remembered, was a quadruple point at which the four\r\nphases sodium sulphate decahydrate, anhydrous sodium sulphate, solution,\r\nand vapour, could co-exist; and was also the point of intersection of the\r\ncurves for four univariant systems. In the case of the formation of double\r\nsalts, similar relationships are met with; and also certain differences,\r\ndue to the fact that we are now dealing with systems of three components.\r\nTwo cases will be chosen here for brief description, one in which\r\nformation, the other in which decomposition of the double salt occurs with\r\nrise of temperature.\r\n\r\nOn heating a mixture of sodium sulphate decahydrate and magnesium sulphate\r\nheptahydrate, it is found that at 22deg partial liquefaction occurs with\r\nformation of astracanite. At this temperature, therefore, there can coexist\r\nthe five phases--\r\n\r\n  Na_{2}SO_{4},10H_{2}O; MgSO_{4},7H_{2}O; Na_{2}Mg(SO_{4})_{2},4H_{2}O;\r\n  solution; vapour.\r\n\r\nThis constitutes, therefore, a _quintuple point_; and since there are three\r\ncomponents present in five phases, the system is invariant. This point,\r\nalso, will be the point of intersection of curves for five univariant\r\nsystems, which, in this case, must each be composed of four phases. These\r\nsystems are--\r\n\r\n{262}\r\n\r\n    I. Na_{2}SO_{4},10H_{2}O; MgSO_{4},7H_{2}O;\r\n    Na_{2}Mg(SO_{4})_{2},4H_{2}O; vapour.\r\n\r\n    II. Na_{2}SO_{4},10H_{2}O; MgSO_{4},7H_{2}O; solution; vapour.\r\n\r\n    III. MgSO_{4},7H_{2}O; Na_{2}Mg(SO_{4})_{2},4H_{2}O; solution; vapour.\r\n\r\n    IV. Na_{2}SO_{4},10H_{2}O; Na_{2}Mg(SO_{4})_{2},4H_{2}O; solution;\r\n    vapour.\r\n\r\n    V. Na_{2}SO_{4},10H_{2}O; MgSO_{4},7H_{2}O;\r\n    Na_{2}Mg(SO_{4})_{2},4H_{2}O; solution.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 98.]\r\n\r\nOn representing the vapour pressures of these different systems\r\ngraphically, a diagram is obtained such as is shown in Fig. 98,[342] the\r\ncurves being numbered in accordance with the above list. When the system I.\r\nis heated, the vapour pressure increases until at the quintuple point the\r\nliquid phase (solution) is formed, and it will then depend on the relative\r\namounts of the different phases whether on further heating there is formed\r\nsystem III., IV., or V. If either of the first two is produced, we shall\r\nobtain the vapour pressure of the solutions saturated with respect to both\r\ndouble salt and one of the single salts; while if the vapour phase\r\ndisappears, there will be obtained the pressure of the condensed systems\r\nformed of double salt, two single salts and solution. This curve,\r\ntherefore, indicates the _change of the transition point with pressure_;\r\nand since in the ordinary determinations of the transition point in open\r\nvessels, we are in reality dealing with condensed systems under the\r\npressure of 1 atm., it will be evident that the transition point does not\r\naccurately coincide with the quintuple point (at which the system is under\r\nthe pressure of its own vapour). As in the case of other condensed systems,\r\nhowever, pressure has only a slight influence on the temperature of the\r\ntransition point. Whether or not pressure raises or lowers the transition\r\npoint will depend on whether transformation is accompanied by an increase\r\nor {263} diminution of volume (theorem of Le Chatelier, p. 58). In the case\r\nof the formation of astracanite, expansion occurs, and the transition point\r\nwill therefore be raised by increase of pressure. Although measurements\r\nhave not been made in the case of this system, the existence of such a\r\ncurve has been experimentally verified in the case of copper and calcium\r\nacetates and water (v. _infra_).[343]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 99.]\r\n\r\nThe vapour pressure diagram in the case of copper calcium acetate and water\r\n(Fig. 99), is almost the reverse of that already discussed. In this case,\r\nthe double salt decomposes on heating, and the decomposition is accompanied\r\nby a contraction. Curve I. is the vapour pressure curve for double salt,\r\ntwo single salts (p. 260), and vapour; curves II. and III. give the vapour\r\npressures of solutions saturated with respect to double salt and one of the\r\nsingle salts; curve IV. is the curve of pressures for the solutions\r\nsaturated with respect to the two single salts; while curve V. again\r\nrepresents the change of the transition point with pressure. On examining\r\nthis diagram, it is seen that whereas {264} astracanite could exist both\r\nabove and below the quintuple point, copper calcium acetate can exist only\r\n_below_ the quintuple point. This behaviour is found only in those cases in\r\nwhich the double salt is decomposed by rise of temperature, and where the\r\ndecomposition is accompanied by a diminution of volume.[344]\r\n\r\nAs already mentioned, the decomposition of copper calcium acetate into the\r\nsingle salts and saturated solution is accompanied by a contraction, and it\r\nwas therefore to be expected that increase of pressure would _lower_ the\r\ntransition point. This expectation of theory was confirmed by experiment,\r\nfor van't Hoff and Spring found that although the transition point under\r\natmospheric pressure is about 75deg, decomposition of the double salt took\r\nplace even at the ordinary temperature when the pressure was increased to\r\n6000 atm.[345]\r\n\r\nSolubility Curves at the Transition Point.--At the transition point, as has\r\nalready been shown, the double salt and the two constituent salts can exist\r\nin equilibrium with the same solution. The transition point, therefore,\r\nmust be the point of intersection of two solubility curves; the solubility\r\ncurve of the double salt and the solubility curve of the mixtures of the\r\ntwo constituent salts. It should be noted here that we are not dealing with\r\nthe solubility curves of the single salts separately, for since the systems\r\nare composed of three components, a single solid phase can, at a given\r\ntemperature, be in equilibrium with solutions of different composition, and\r\ntwo solid phases in contact with solution (and vapour) are therefore\r\nnecessary to give an univariant system. The same applies, of course, to the\r\nsolubility of the double salt; for a double salt also constitutes a single\r\nphase, and can therefore exist in equilibrium with solutions of varying\r\ncomposition. If, however, we make the restriction (which we do for the\r\npresent) that the double salt is not decomposed by water, then the solution\r\nwill contain the constituent salts in the same relative proportions as they\r\nare contained in the double salt, and the system may therefore be regarded\r\nas one of _two_ components, viz. double salt and water. In this case one\r\nsolid phase is sufficient, with solution and {265} vapour, to give an\r\nunivariant system; and at a given temperature, therefore, the solubility\r\nwill have a perfectly definite value.\r\n\r\nSince in almost all cases the solubility is determined in open vessels, we\r\nshall in the following discussion consider that the vapour phase is absent,\r\nand that the system is under a constant pressure, that of the atmosphere.\r\nWith this restriction, therefore, four phases will constitute an invariant\r\nsystem, three phases an univariant, and two phases a bivariant system.\r\n\r\nIt has already been learned that in the case of sodium sulphate and water,\r\nthe solubility curve of the salt undergoes a sudden change in direction at\r\nthe transition point, and that this is accompanied by a change in the solid\r\nphase in equilibrium with the solution. The same behaviour is also found in\r\nthe case of double salts. To illustrate this, we shall briefly discuss the\r\nsolubility relations of a few double salts, beginning with one of the\r\nsimplest cases, that of the formation of rubidium racemate from rubidium\r\n_d_- and _l_-tartrates. The solubilities are represented diagrammatically\r\nin Fig. 100, the numerical data being contained in the following table, in\r\nwhich the solubility is expressed as the number of gram-molecules\r\nRb_{2}C_{4}H_{4}O_{6} in 100 gm.-molecules of water.[346]\r\n\r\n  ---------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  Temperature. | Solubility of tartrate | Solubility of racemate.\r\n               |        mixture.        |\r\n  ---------------------------------------------------------------\r\n     25deg     |         13.03          |          10.91\r\n     35deg     |          --            |          12.63\r\n     40.4deg   |          --            |          13.48\r\n     40.7deg   |         13.46          |           --\r\n     54deg     |         13.83          |           --\r\n  ---------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 100 the curve AB represents the solubility of the racemate, while\r\nA'BC represents the solubility of the mixed tartrates. Below the transition\r\npoint, therefore, the solubility of the racemate is less than that of the\r\nmixed tartrates. The solution, saturated with respect to the latter, will\r\nbe supersaturated with respect to the racemate; and if a nucleus of this is\r\npresent, racemate will be deposited, and the mixed tartrates, if present in\r\nequimolecular amounts, will ultimately {266} entirely disappear, and only\r\nracemate will be left as solid phase. The solution will then have the\r\ncomposition represented by a point on the curve AB. Conversely, above the\r\ntransition point, the saturated solution of the racemate would be\r\nsupersaturated with respect to the two tartrates, and transformation into\r\nthe latter would ensue. If, therefore, a solution of equimolecular\r\nproportions of rubidium _d_- and _l_-tartrates is allowed to evaporate at a\r\ntemperature above 40deg, a mixture of the two tartrates will be deposited;\r\nwhile at temperatures below 40deg the racemate will separate out.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 100.]\r\n\r\nSimilar relationships are met with in the case of sodium ammonium _d_- and\r\n_l_-tartrate and sodium ammonium racemate; but in this case the racemate is\r\nthe stable form in contact with solution above the transition point\r\n(27deg).[347] Below the transition point, therefore, the solubility curve\r\nof the mixed tartrates will lie below the solubility curve of the racemate.\r\nBelow the transition point, therefore, sodium ammonium racemate will break\r\nup in contact with solution into a mixture of sodium ammonium _d_- and\r\n_l_-tartrates. At a higher temperature, 35deg, sodium ammonium racemate\r\nundergoes decomposition into sodium racemate and ammonium racemate.[348]\r\n\r\nThe behaviour of sodium ammonium racemate is of interest from the fact that\r\nit was the first racemic substance to be resolved into its optically active\r\nforms by a process of crystallization. On neutralizing a solution of\r\nracemic tartaric acid, half with soda and half with ammonia, and allowing\r\nthe solution to evaporate, Pasteur[349] obtained a mixture of sodium\r\nammonium {267} _d_- and _l_-tartrates. Since Pasteur was unaware of the\r\nexistence of a transition point, the success of his experiment was due to\r\nthe happy chance that he allowed the solution to evaporate at a temperature\r\nbelow 27deg; for had he employed a temperature above this, separation of\r\nthe racemate into the two enantiomorphous forms would not have occurred.\r\nFor this reason the attempt of Staedel to perform the same resolution met\r\nonly with failure.[350]\r\n\r\nDecomposition of the Double Salt by Water.--In the two cases just\r\ndescribed, the solubility relationships at the transition point are of a\r\nsimpler character than in the case of most double salts. If, at a\r\ntemperature above the transition point, a mixture of rubidium _d_- and\r\n_l_-tartrates in equimolecular proportions is brought in contact with water\r\na solution will be obtained, which is saturated with respect to both\r\nenantiomorphous forms; and since the solubility of the two optical\r\nantipodes is identical, and the effect of one on the solubility of the\r\nother also the same, the solution will contain equimolecular amounts of the\r\n_d_- and _l_-salt. If, now, the solution is cooled down in contact with the\r\nsolid salts to just below the transition point, it becomes supersaturated\r\nwith respect to the racemate, and this will be deposited. The solution\r\nthereby becomes unsaturated with respect to the mixture of the active\r\nsalts, and these must therefore pass into solution. As the latter are\r\nequally soluble, equal amounts of each will dissolve, and a further\r\nquantity of the racemate will be deposited. These processes of solution and\r\ndeposition will continue until the single tartrates have completely\r\ndisappeared, and only racemate is left as solid phase. As a consequence of\r\nthe identical solubility of the two tartrates, therefore, no excess of\r\neither form will be left on passing through the transition point. From this\r\nit will be evident that the racemate can exist as single solid phase in\r\ncontact with its saturated solution at the transition point; or, in other\r\nwords, the racemate is not decomposed by water at the transition point. The\r\nsame behaviour will evidently be exhibited by sodium ammonium racemate at\r\n27deg, for the two enantiomorphous sodium ammonium tartrates have also\r\nidentical solubility.\r\n\r\n{268}\r\n\r\nVery different, however, is the behaviour of, say, astracanite, or of the\r\nmajority of double salts; for the solubility of the constituent salts is\r\nnow no longer the same. If, for example, excess of a mixture of sodium\r\nsulphate and magnesium sulphate, in equimolecular proportions, is brought\r\nin contact with water below the transition point (22deg), more magnesium\r\nsulphate than sodium sulphate will dissolve, the solubility of these two\r\nsalts in a common solution being given by the following figures, which\r\nexpress number of molecules of the salt in 100 molecules of water.[351]\r\n\r\n  COMPOSITION OF SOLUTIONS SATURATED WITH RESPECT TO\r\n  Na_{2}SO_{4},10H_{2}O AND MgSO_{4},7H_{2}O.\r\n\r\n  ----------------------------------------\r\n  Temperature. | Na_{2}SO_{4}. | MgSO_{4}.\r\n  ----------------------------------------\r\n     18.5deg   |      2.16     |   4.57\r\n     24.5deg   |      3.43     |   4.68\r\n  ----------------------------------------\r\n\r\nAt the transition point, then, it is evident that the solution contains\r\nmore magnesium sulphate than sodium sulphate: and this must still be the\r\ncase when astracanite, which contains sodium sulphate and magnesium\r\nsulphate in equimolecular proportions, separates out. If, therefore, the\r\ntemperature is raised slightly above the transition point, magnesium\r\nsulphate and sodium sulphate will pass into solution, the former, however,\r\nin larger quantities than the latter, and astracanite will be deposited;\r\nand this will go on until all the magnesium sulphate has disappeared, and a\r\nmixture of astracanite and sodium sulphate decahydrate is left as solid\r\nphases. Since there are now three phases present, the system is univariant\r\n(by reason of the restriction previously made that the vapour phase is\r\nabsent), and at a given temperature the solution will have a definite\r\ncomposition; as given in the following table:--\r\n\r\n  COMPOSITION OF SOLUTIONS SATURATED WITH RESPECT TO\r\n  Na_{2}Mg(SO_{4})_{2},4H_{2}O AND Na_{2}SO_{4},10H_{2}O.\r\n\r\n  ----------------------------------------\r\n  Temperature. | Na_{2}SO_{4}. | MgSO_{4}.\r\n  ----------------------------------------\r\n     22deg     |      2.95     |   4.70\r\n     24.5deg   |      3.45     |   3.62\r\n  ----------------------------------------\r\n\r\n{269}\r\n\r\nFrom the above figures, therefore, it will be seen that at a temperature\r\njust above the transition point a solution in contact with the two solid\r\nphases, astracanite and Glauber's salt, contains a relatively smaller\r\namount of sodium sulphate than a pure solution of astracanite would; for in\r\nthis case there would be equal molecular amounts of Na_{2}SO_{4} and\r\nMgSO_{4}. A solution which is saturated with respect to astracanite alone,\r\nwill contain more sodium sulphate than the solution saturated with respect\r\nto astracanite plus Glauber's salt, and the latter will therefore be\r\ndeposited. From this, therefore, it is clear that if astracanite is brought\r\nin contact with water at about the transition point, it will undergo\r\ndecomposition with separation of Glauber's salt (supersaturation being\r\nexcluded).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 101.]\r\n\r\nThis will perhaps be made clearer by considering Fig. 101. In this diagram\r\nthe ordinates represent the ratio of sodium sulphate to magnesium sulphate\r\nin the solutions, and the abscissae represent the temperatures. The line AB\r\nrepresents solutions saturated with respect to a mixture of the single\r\nsalts (p. 268); BC refers to solutions in equilibrium with astracanite and\r\nmagnesium sulphate; while BX represents the composition of solutions in\r\ncontact with the solid phases astracanite and Glauber's salt. The values of\r\nthe solubility are contained in the following table, and in that on p. 268,\r\nand are, as before, expressed in gm.-molecules of salt in 100 gm.-molecules\r\nof water.[352]\r\n\r\n{270}\r\n\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n               | Astracanite                | Astracanite\r\n  Temperature. |        + sodium sulphate.  |        + magnesium sulphate.\r\n               |----------------------------|------------------------------\r\n               | Na_{2}SO_{4}. |  MgSO_{4}. | Na_{2}SO_{4}. |  MgSO_{4}.\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n     18.5deg   |       --      |      --    |      3.41     |    4.27\r\n     22deg     |      2.95     |     4.70   |      2.85     |    4.63\r\n     24.5deg   |      3.45     |     3.62   |      2.68     |    4.76\r\n     30deg     |      4.58     |     2.91   |      2.30     |    5.31\r\n     35deg     |      4.30     |     2.76   |      1.73     |    5.88\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nAt the transition point the ratio of sodium sulphate to magnesium sulphate\r\nis approximately 1 : 1.6. In the case of solutions saturated with respect\r\nto both astracanite and Glauber's salt, the relative amount of sodium\r\nsulphate increases as the temperature rises, while in the solutions\r\nsaturated for astracanite and magnesium sulphate, the ratio of sodium\r\nsulphate to magnesium sulphate decreases.\r\n\r\nIf, now, we consider only the temperatures above the transition point, we\r\nsee from the figure that solutions represented by points above the line BX\r\ncontain relatively more sodium sulphate than solutions in contact with\r\nastracanite and Glauber's salt; and solutions lying below the line BC\r\ncontain relatively more magnesium sulphate than solutions saturated with\r\nthis salt and astracanite. These solutions will therefore not be stable,\r\nbut will deposit in the one case, astracanite and Glauber's salt, and in\r\nthe other case, astracanite and magnesium sulphate, until a point on BX or\r\nBC is reached. All solutions, however, lying to the right of CBX, will be\r\n_unsaturated_ with respect to these two pairs of salts, and only the\r\nsolutions represented by the line XY (and which contain equimolecular\r\namounts of sodium and magnesium sulphates) will be saturated with respect\r\nto the pure double salt.\r\n\r\nTransition Interval.--Fig. 101 will also render intelligible a point of\r\ngreat importance in connection with astracanite, and of double salts\r\ngenerally. At temperatures between those represented by the points B and X,\r\nthe double salt when brought in contact with water will be decomposed with\r\nseparation of sodium sulphate. Above the temperature of the point {271} X,\r\nhowever, the solution of the pure double salt is stable, because it can\r\nstill take up a little of either of the components. At temperatures, then,\r\nabove that at which the solution in contact with the double salt and the\r\nless soluble single salt, contains the single salts in the ratio in which\r\nthey are present in the double salt, solution of the latter will take place\r\nwithout decomposition. _The range of temperature between that at which\r\ndouble salt can begin to be formed (the transition point) and that at which\r\nit ceases to be decomposed by water is called the transition\r\ninterval._[353] If the two single salts have identical solubility at the\r\ntransition point, the transition interval diminishes to nought.\r\n\r\nIn those cases where the double salt is the stable form below the\r\ntransition point, the transition interval will extend downwards to a lower\r\ntemperature. Fig. 101 will then have the reverse form.\r\n\r\nSummary.--With regard to double salts we have learned that their formation\r\nfrom and their decomposition into the single salts, is connected with a\r\ndefinite temperature, the _transition temperature_. At this transition\r\ntemperature two vapour pressure curves cut, viz. a curve of dehydration of\r\na mixture of the single salts and the solubility curve of the double salt;\r\nor the dehydration curve of the double salt and the solubility curve of the\r\nmixed single salts. The solubility curves, also, of these two systems\r\nintersect at the transition point, but although the formation of the double\r\nsalt commences at the transition point, complete stability in contact with\r\nwater may not be attained till some temperature above (or below) that\r\npoint. _Only when the temperature is beyond the transition interval, will a\r\ndouble salt dissolve in water without decomposition (_e.g._ the alums)._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{272}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nISOTHERMAL CURVES AND THE SPACE MODEL\r\n\r\nIn the preceding chapter we considered the changes in the solubility of\r\ndouble salts and of mixtures of their constituent salts with the\r\ntemperature; noting, more especially, the relationships between the two\r\nsystems at the transition point. It is now proposed to conclude the study\r\nof the three-component systems by discussing very briefly the solubility\r\nrelations at constant temperature, or the isothermal solubility curves. In\r\nthis way fresh light will be thrown on the change in the solubility of one\r\ncomponent by the addition of another component, and also on the conditions\r\nof formation and stable existence of double salts in solution. With the\r\nhelp of these isothermal curves, also, the phenomena of crystallization at\r\nconstant temperature--phenomena which have not only a scientific interest\r\nbut also an important bearing on the industrial preparation of double\r\nsalts--will be more clearly understood.[354]\r\n\r\nA brief description will also be given of the method of representing the\r\nvariation of the concentration of the two salts in the solution with the\r\ntemperature.\r\n\r\nNon-formation of Double Salts.--In Fig. 102 are shown the solubility curves\r\nof two salts, A and B, which at the given temperature do not form a double\r\nsalt.[355] The ordinates represent the amount of A, the abscissae the\r\namount of B in a _constant amount_ of the third component, the solvent. The\r\n{273} point A, therefore, represents the solubility of the salt A at the\r\ngiven temperature; and similarly, point B represents the solubility of B.\r\nSince we are dealing with a three-component system, one solid phase in\r\ncontact with solution will constitute a bivariant system (in the absence of\r\nthe vapour phase and under a constant pressure). At any given temperature,\r\ntherefore, the concentration of the solution in equilibrium with the solid\r\ncan undergo change. If, now, to a pure solution of A a small quantity of B\r\nis added, the solubility of A will in general be altered; as a rule it is\r\ndiminished, but sometimes it is increased.[356] The curve AC represents the\r\nvarying composition of the solution in equilibrium with the solid component\r\nA. Similarly, the curve BC represents the composition of the solutions in\r\ncontact with pure B as solid phase. At the point, C, where these two curves\r\nintersect, there are two solid phases, viz. pure A and pure B, in\r\nequilibrium with solution, and the system becomes invariant. At this point\r\nthe solution is saturated with respect to both A and B, and at a given\r\ntemperature must have a perfectly definite composition. To take an example,\r\nif we suppose A to represent sodium sulphate decahydrate, and B, magnesium\r\nsulphate heptahydrate, and the temperature to be 18.5deg (_i.e._ below the\r\ntransition point), the point C would represent a solution containing 2.16\r\ngm.-molecules Na_{2}SO_{4} and 4.57 gm.-molecules MgSO_{4} per 100\r\ngm.-molecules of water (p. 268). The curve ACB is the boundary curve for\r\nsaturated solutions; solutions lying outside this curve are supersaturated,\r\nthose lying within the area ACBO, are unsaturated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 102.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 103.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 104.]\r\n\r\nFormation of Double Salt.--We have already learned in the preceding chapter\r\nthat if the temperature is outside[357] the {274} transition interval, it\r\nis possible to prepare a pure saturated solution of the double salt. If,\r\nnow, we suppose the double salt to contain the two constituent salts in\r\nequimolecular proportions, its saturated solution must be represented by a\r\npoint lying on the line which bisects the angle AOB; _e.g._ point D, Fig.\r\n103. But a double salt constitutes only a single phase, and can exist,\r\ntherefore, in contact with solutions of varying concentration, as\r\nrepresented by EDF.\r\n\r\nLet us compare, now, the relations between the solubility curve for the\r\ndouble salt, and those for the two constituent salts. We shall suppose that\r\nthe double salt is formed from the single salts when the temperature is\r\nraised above a certain point (as in the formation of astracanite). At a\r\ntemperature below the transition point, as we have already seen, the\r\nsolubility of the double salt is greater than that of a mixture of the\r\nsingle salts. The curve EDF, therefore, must lie above the point C, in the\r\nregion representing solutions supersaturated with respect to the single\r\nsalts (Fig. 104). Such a solution, however, would be metastable, and on\r\nbeing brought in contact with the single salts would deposit these and\r\nyield a solution represented by the point C. At this particular\r\ntemperature, therefore, the isothermal solubility curve will consist of\r\nonly two branches.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 105.]\r\n\r\nSuppose, now, that the temperature is that of the transition point. At this\r\npoint, the double salt can exist together with the single salts in contact\r\nwith solution. The solubility curve {275} of the double salt must,\r\ntherefore, pass through the point C, as shown in Fig. 105.\r\n\r\nFrom this figure, now, it is seen that a solution saturated with respect to\r\ndouble salt alone (point D), is supersaturated with respect to the\r\ncomponent A. If, then, at the temperature of the transition point, excess\r\nof the double salt is brought in contact with water,[358] and if\r\nsupersaturation is excluded, _the double salt will undergo decomposition\r\nand the component A will be deposited_. The relative concentration of the\r\ncomponent B in the solution will, therefore, increase, and the composition\r\nof the solution will be thereby altered in the direction DC. When the\r\nsolution has the composition of C, the single salt ceases to be deposited,\r\nfor at this point the solution is saturated for both double and single\r\nsalt; and the system becomes invariant.\r\n\r\nThis diagram explains very clearly the phenomenon of the decomposition of a\r\ndouble salt at the transition point. As is evident, this decomposition will\r\noccur when the solution which is saturated at the temperature of the\r\ntransition point, with respect to the two single salts (point C), does not\r\ncontain these salts in the same ratio in which they are present in the\r\ndouble salt. If point C lay on the dotted line bisecting the right angle,\r\nthen the pure saturated solution of the double salt would not be\r\nsupersaturated with respect to either of the single salts, and the double\r\nsalt would, therefore, not be decomposed by water. As has already been\r\nmentioned, this behaviour is found in the case of optically active\r\nisomerides, the solubilities of which are identical.\r\n\r\nAt the transition point, therefore, the isothermal curve also consists of\r\ntwo branches; but the point of intersection of the two branches now\r\nrepresents a solution which is saturated not {276} only with respect to the\r\nsingle salts, but also for the double salt in presence of the single salts.\r\n\r\nWe have just seen that by a change of temperature the two solubility\r\ncurves, that for the two single salts and that for the double salt, were\r\nmade to approach one another (_cf._ Figs. 104 and 105). In the previous\r\nchapter, however, we found that on passing the transition point to the\r\nregion of stability for the double salt, the solution which is saturated\r\nfor a mixture of the two constituent salts, is supersaturated for the\r\ndouble salt. In this case, therefore, point C must lie above the solubility\r\ncurve of the pure double salt (Fig. 106), and a solution of the composition\r\nC, if brought in contact with double salt, will deposit the latter. If the\r\nsingle salts were also present, then as the double salt separated out, the\r\nsingle salts would pass into solution, because so long as the two single\r\nsalts are present, the composition of the solution must remain unaltered.\r\nIf one of the single salts disappear before the other, there will be left\r\ndouble salt plus A or double salt plus B, according to which was in excess;\r\nand the composition of the solution will be either that represented by D\r\n(saturated for double salt plus A), or that of the point F (saturated for\r\ndouble salt plus B).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 106.]\r\n\r\nIn connection with the isothermal represented in Fig. 106, it should be\r\nnoted that at this particular temperature a solution saturated with respect\r\nto the pure double salt is no longer supersaturated for one of the single\r\nsalts (point D); so that at the temperature of this isothermal the double\r\nsalt is not decomposed by water. At this temperature, further, the boundary\r\ncurve consists of three branches AD, DF, and FB, which give the composition\r\nof the solutions in equilibrium with pure A, double salt, and pure B\r\nrespectively; while the points D and F represent solutions saturated for\r\ndouble salt plus A and double salt plus B.\r\n\r\nOn continuing to alter the temperature in the same direction {277} as\r\nbefore, the relative shifting of the solubility curves becomes more marked,\r\nas shown in Fig. 107. At the temperature of this isothermal, the solution\r\nsaturated for the double salt now lies in a region of distinct unsaturation\r\nwith respect to the single salts; and the double salt can now exist as\r\nsolid phase in contact with solutions containing both relatively more of A\r\n(curve ED), and relatively more of B (curve DF), than is contained in the\r\ndouble salt itself.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 107.]\r\n\r\nTransition Interval.--From what has been said, and from an examination of\r\nthe isothermal diagrams, Figs. 104-107, it will be seen that by a variation\r\nof the temperature we can pass from a condition where the double salt is\r\nquite incapable of existing in contact with solution (supersaturation being\r\nexcluded), to a condition where the existence of the double salt in\r\npresence of solution becomes possible; only in the presence, however, of\r\none of the single salts (_transition point_, Fig. 105). A further change of\r\ntemperature leads to a condition where the stable existence of the pure\r\ndouble salt in contact with solution just becomes possible (Fig. 106); and\r\nfrom this point onwards, pure saturated solutions of the double salt can be\r\nobtained (Fig. 107). _At any temperature, therefore, between that\r\nrepresented by Fig. 105, and that represented by Fig. 106, the double salt\r\nundergoes partial decomposition, with deposition of one of the constituent\r\nsalts._ The temperature range between the transition point and the\r\ntemperature at which a stable saturated solution of the pure double salt\r\njust begins to be possible, is known as the _transition interval_ (p. 270).\r\nAs the figures show, the transition interval is limited on the one side by\r\nthe transition temperature, and on the other by the temperature at which\r\nthe solution saturated for double salt and the less soluble of the single\r\nsalts, contains the component salts in the same ratio as they are present\r\nin the double salt. The greater the difference in the solubility of the\r\nsingle salts, the larger will be the transition interval. {278}\r\n\r\nIsothermal Evaporation.--The isothermal solubility curves are of great\r\nimportance for obtaining an insight into the behaviour of a solution when\r\nsubjected to isothermal evaporation. To simplify the discussion of the\r\nrelationships found here, we shall still suppose that the double salt\r\ncontains the single salts in equimolecular proportions; and we shall, in\r\nthe first instance, suppose that the unsaturated solution with which we\r\ncommence, also contains the single salts in the same ratio. The composition\r\nof the solution must, therefore, be represented by some point lying on the\r\nline OD, the bisectrix of the right angle.\r\n\r\nFrom what has been said, it is evident that when the formation of a double\r\nsalt can occur, three temperature intervals can be distinguished, viz. the\r\nsingle-salt interval, the transition interval, and the double-salt\r\ninterval.[359] When the temperature lies in the first interval, evaporation\r\nleads first of all to the crystallization of one of the single salts, and\r\nthen to the separation of both the single salts together. In the second\r\ntemperature interval, evaporation again leads, in the first place, to the\r\ndeposition of one of the single salts, and afterwards to the\r\ncrystallization of the double salt. In the third temperature interval, only\r\nthe double salt crystallizes out. This will become clearer from what\r\nfollows.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 108.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 109.]\r\n\r\nIf an unsaturated solution of the two single salts in equimolecular\r\nproportion (_e.g._ point _x_, Fig. 108) is evaporated at a temperature at\r\nwhich the formation of double salt is impossible, the component A, the\r\nsolubility curve of which is {279} cut by the line OD, will first separate\r\nout; the solution will thereby become richer in B. On continued\r\nevaporation, more A will be deposited, and the composition of the solution\r\nwill change until it attains the composition represented by the point C,\r\nwhen both A and B will be deposited, and the composition of the solution\r\nwill remain unchanged. The result of evaporation will therefore be a\r\nmixture of the two components.\r\n\r\nIf the formation of double salt is possible, but if the temperature lies\r\nwithin the transition interval, the relations will be represented by a\r\ndiagram like Fig. 109. Isothermal evaporation of the solution X will lead\r\nto the deposition of the component A, and the composition of the solution\r\nwill alter in the direction DE; at the latter point the double salt will be\r\nformed, and the composition of the solution will remain unchanged so long\r\nas the two solid phases are present. As can be seen from the diagram,\r\nhowever, the solution in E contains less of component A than is contained\r\nin the double salt. Deposition of the double salt at E, therefore, would\r\nlead to a relative decrease in the concentration of A in the solution, and\r\nto counterbalance this, _the salt which separated out at the commencement\r\nmust redissolve_.\r\n\r\nSince the salts were originally present in equimolecular proportions, the\r\nfinal result of evaporation will be the pure double salt. If when the\r\nsolution has reached the point E the salt A which had separated out is\r\nremoved, double salt only will be left as solid phase. At a given\r\ntemperature, however, a single solid phase can exist in equilibrium with\r\nsolutions of different composition. If, therefore, isothermal evaporation\r\nis continued after the removal of the salt A, double salt will be\r\ndeposited, and the composition of the solution will change in the direction\r\nEF. At the point F the salt B will separate out, and on evaporation both\r\ndouble salt and the salt B will be deposited. In the former case (when the\r\nsalt A disappears on evaporation) we are dealing with an _incongruently\r\nsaturated solution_; but in the latter case, where both solid phases\r\ncontinue to be deposited, the solution is said to be _congruently\r\nsaturated_.[360]\r\n\r\nA \"congruently saturated solution\" is one from which the {280} solid phases\r\nare continuously deposited during isothermal evaporation to dryness,\r\nwhereas in the case of \"incongruently saturated solutions,\" at least one of\r\nthe solid phases disappears during the process of evaporation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 110.]\r\n\r\nLastly, if the temperature lies outside the transition interval, isothermal\r\nevaporation of an unsaturated solution of the composition X (Fig. 110) will\r\nlead to the deposition of pure double salt from beginning to end. If a\r\nsolution of the composition Y is evaporated, the component A will first be\r\ndeposited and the composition of the solution will alter in the direction\r\nof E, at which point double salt will separate out. Since the solution at\r\nthis point contains relatively more of A than is present in the double\r\nsalt, both the double salt and the single salt A will be deposited on\r\ncontinued evaporation, in order that the composition of the solution shall\r\nremain unchanged. In the case of solution Z, first component B and\r\nafterwards the double salt will be deposited. The result will, therefore,\r\nbe a mixture of double salt and the salt B (congruently saturated\r\nsolutions),\r\n\r\nIt may be stated here that the same relationships as have been explained\r\nabove for double salts are also found in the resolution of racemic\r\ncompounds by means of optically active substances (third method of\r\nPasteur). In this case the single salts are doubly active substances\r\n(_e.g._ strychnine-_d_-tartrate and strychnine-_l_-tartrate), and the\r\ndouble salt is a partially racemic compound.[361]\r\n\r\nCrystallization of Double Salt from Solutions containing Excess of One\r\nComponent.--One more case of isothermal crystallization may be discussed.\r\nIt is well known that a double salt which is decomposed by pure water can\r\nnevertheless be obtained pure by crystallization from a solution containing\r\nexcess of one of the single salts (_e.g._ in the case of carnallite). Since\r\nthe double salt is partially decomposed by water, the temperature of the\r\nexperiment must be within the transition {281} interval, and the relations\r\nwill, therefore, be represented by a diagram like Fig. 109. If, now,\r\ninstead of starting with an unsaturated solution containing the single\r\nsalts in equimolecular proportions, we commence with one in which excess of\r\none of the salts is present, as represented by the point Y, isothermal\r\nevaporation will cause the composition to alter in the direction YD', the\r\nrelative amounts of the single salts remaining the same throughout. When\r\nthe composition of the solution reaches the point D', pure double salt will\r\nbe deposited. The separation of double salt will, however, cause a relative\r\ndecrease in the concentration of the salt A, and the composition of the\r\nsolution will, therefore, alter in the direction D'F. If the evaporation is\r\ndiscontinued before the solution has attained the composition F, only\r\ndouble salt will have separated out. Even within the transition interval,\r\ntherefore, pure double salt can be obtained by crystallization, provided\r\nthe original solution has a composition represented by a point lying\r\nbetween the two lines OE and OF. Since, as already shown, the composition\r\nof the solution alters on evaporation in the direction EF, it will be best\r\nto employ a solution having a composition near to the line OE.\r\n\r\nFormation of Mixed Crystals.--If the two single salts A and B do not\r\ncrystallize out pure from solution, but form an unbroken series of mixed\r\ncrystals, it is evident that an invariant system cannot be produced. The\r\nsolubility curve will therefore be continuous from A to B; the liquid\r\nsolutions of varying composition being in equilibrium with solid solutions\r\nalso of varying composition. If, however, the series of mixed crystals is\r\nnot continuous, there will be a break in the solubility curve at which two\r\nsolid solutions of different composition will be in equilibrium with liquid\r\nsolution. This, of course, will constitute an invariant system, and the\r\npoint will correspond to the point C in Fig. 108. A full discussion of\r\nthese systems would, however, lead us too far, and the above indication of\r\nthe behaviour must suffice.[362]\r\n\r\n{282}\r\n\r\nApplication to the Characterization of Racemates.--The form of the\r\nisothermal solubility curves is also of great value for determining whether\r\nan inactive substance is a racemic compound or a conglomerate of equal\r\nproportions of the optical antipodes.[363]\r\n\r\nAs has already been pointed out, the formation of racemic compounds from\r\nthe two enantiomorphous isomerides, is analogous to the formation of double\r\nsalts. The isothermal solubility curves, also, have a similar form. In the\r\ncase of the latter, indeed, the relationships are simplified by the fact\r\nthat the two enantiomorphous forms have identical solubility, and the\r\nsolubility curves are therefore symmetrical to the line bisecting the angle\r\nof the co-ordinates. Further, with the exception of the partially racemic\r\ncompounds to be mentioned later, there is no transition interval.\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 111, are given diagrammatically two isothermal solubility curves\r\nfor optically active substances. From what has been said in the immediately\r\npreceding pages, the figure ought really to explain itself. The upper\r\nisothermal _acb_ represents the solubility relations when the formation of\r\na racemic compound is excluded, as, _e.g._ in the case of rubidium _d_- and\r\n_l_-tartrates above the transition point (p. 265). The solution at the\r\npoint _c_ is, of course, inactive, and _is unaffected by addition of either\r\nthe _d_- or _l_- form_. The lower isothermal, on the other hand, would be\r\nobtained at a temperature at which the racemic compound could be formed.\r\nThe curve _a'e_ is the solubility curve for the _l_- form; _b'f_, that for\r\nthe _d_- form; and _edf_, that for the racemic compound in presence of\r\nsolutions of varying concentration. The point _d_ corresponds to saturation\r\nfor the pure racemic compound.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 111.]\r\n\r\nFrom these curves now, it will be evident that it will be possible, in any\r\ngiven case, to decide whether or not an inactive body is a mixture or a\r\nracemic compound. For this purpose, {283} two solubility determinations are\r\nmade, first with the inactive material alone (in excess), and then with the\r\ninactive material plus excess of one of the optically active forms. If we\r\nare dealing with a mixture, the two solutions thus obtained will be\r\nidentical; both will have the composition corresponding to the point _c_,\r\nand will be inactive. If, however, the inactive material is a racemic\r\ncompound, then two different solutions will be obtained; namely, an\r\ninactive solution corresponding to the point _d_ (Fig. 111), and an\r\n_active_ solution corresponding either to _e_ or to _f_, according to which\r\nenantiomorphous form was added.\r\n\r\n_Partially racemic compounds._[364] In this case we are no longer dealing\r\nwith enantiomorphous forms, and the solubility of the two oppositely active\r\nisomerides is no longer the same. The symmetry of the solubility curves\r\ntherefore disappears, and a figure is obtained which is identical in its\r\ngeneral form with that found in the case of ordinary double salts (Fig.\r\n112). In this case there is a transition interval.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 112.]\r\n\r\nThe curves _acb_ belong to a temperature at which the partially racemic\r\ncompound cannot be formed; _a'dfb'_, to the temperature at which the\r\ncompound just begins to be stable in contact with water, and _a\"ed'f'b\"_\r\nbelongs to a temperature at which the partially racemic compound is quite\r\nstable in contact with water. Suppose now solubility determinations, made\r\nin the first case with the original material alone, and then with the\r\noriginal body plus each of the two compounds, formed from the\r\nenantiomorphous substances separately, then if the original body was a\r\nmixture, identical solutions will be obtained in all three cases (point\r\n_c_); if it was a partially racemic compound, three different solutions\r\n(_e_, _d'_, and _f'_) will be obtained if the temperature was outside the\r\ntransition interval, and two solutions, _d_ and _f_, if the temperature\r\nbelonged to the transition interval.\r\n\r\n{284}\r\n\r\n_Representation in Space._\r\n\r\nSpace Model for Carnallite.--Interesting and important as the isothermal\r\nsolubility curves are, they are insufficient for the purpose of obtaining a\r\nclear insight into the complete behaviour of the systems of two salts and\r\nwater. A short description will, therefore, be given here of the\r\nrepresentation in space of the solubility relations of potassium and\r\nmagnesium chlorides, and of the double salt which they form,\r\ncarnallite.[365]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 113.]\r\n\r\nFig. 113 is a diagrammatic sketch of the model for carnallite looked at\r\nsideways from above. Along the X-axis is measured the concentration of\r\nmagnesium chloride in the {285} solution; along the Y-axis, the\r\nconcentration of potassium chloride; while along the T-axis is measured the\r\ntemperature. The three axes are at right angles to one another. The\r\nXT-plane, therefore, contains the solubility curve of magnesium chloride;\r\nthe YT-plane, the solubility curve of potassium chloride, and in the space\r\nbetween the two planes, there are represented the composition of solutions\r\ncontaining both magnesium and potassium chlorides. Any _surface_ between\r\nthe two planes will represent the various solutions in equilibrium with\r\nonly one solid phase, and will therefore indicate the area or field of\r\nexistence of bivariant ternary systems. A _line_ or _curve_ formed by the\r\nintersection of two surfaces will represent solutions in equilibrium with\r\ntwo solid phases (viz. those belonging to the intersecting surfaces), and\r\nwill show the conditions for the existence of univariant systems. Lastly,\r\n_points_ formed by the intersection of three surfaces will represent\r\ninvariant systems, in which a solution can exist in equilibrium with three\r\nsolid phases (viz. those belonging to the three surfaces).\r\n\r\nWe shall first consider the solubility relations of the single salts. The\r\ncomplete equilibrium curve for magnesium chloride and water is represented\r\nin Fig. 113 by the series of curves ABF_{1} G_{1} H_{1} J_{1} L_{1} N_{1}.\r\nAB is the freezing-point curve of ice in contact with solutions containing\r\nmagnesium chloride, and B is the cryohydric point at which the solid phases\r\nice and MgCl_{2},12H_{2}O can co-exist with solution. BFG is the solubility\r\ncurve of magnesium chloride dodecahydrate. This curve shows a point of\r\nmaximum temperature at F_{1}, and a retroflex portion F_{1}G_{1}. The curve\r\nis therefore of the form exhibited by calcium chloride hexahydrate, or the\r\nhydrates of ferric chloride (Chapter VIII.). G_{1} is a transition point at\r\nwhich the solid phase changes from dodecahydrate to octahydrate, the\r\nsolubility of which is represented by the curve G_{1}H_{1}. At H_{1} the\r\noctahydrate gives place to the hexahydrate, which is the solid phase in\r\nequilibrium with the solutions represented by the curve H_{1}J_{1}. J_{1}\r\nand L_{1} are also transition points at which the solid phase undergoes\r\nchange, in the former case from hexahydrate to tetrahydrate; and in the\r\nlatter case, {286} from tetrahydrate to dihydrate. The complete curve of\r\nequilibrium for magnesium chloride and water is, therefore, somewhat\r\ncomplicated, and is a good example of the solubility curves obtained with\r\nsalts capable of forming several hydrates.\r\n\r\nThe solubility curve of potassium chloride is of the simplest form,\r\nconsisting only of the two branches AC, the freezing-point curve of ice,\r\nand CO, the solubility curve of the salt. C is the cryohydric point. This\r\npoint and the two curves lie in the YT-plane.\r\n\r\nOn passing to the ternary systems, the composition of the solutions must be\r\nrepresented by points or curves situated _between_ the two planes. We shall\r\nnow turn to the consideration of these. BD and CD are ternary eutectic\r\ncurves (p. 284). They give the composition of solutions in equilibrium with\r\nice and magnesium chloride dodecahydrate (BD), and with ice and potassium\r\nchloride (CD). D is a _ternary cryohydric point_. If the temperature is\r\nraised and the ice allowed to disappear, we shall pass to the solubility\r\ncurve for MgCl_{2},12H_{2}O + KCl (curve DE). At E carnallite is formed and\r\nthe potassium chloride disappears; EFG is then the solubility curve for\r\nMgCl_{2},12H_{2}O + carnallite (KMgCl_{3},6H_{2}O). This curve also shows a\r\npoint of maximum temperature (F) and a retroflex portion. GH and HJ\r\nrepresent the solubility curves of carnallite + MgCl_{2},8H_{2}O and\r\ncarnallite + MgCl_{2},6H_{2}O, G and H being transition points. JK is the\r\nsolubility curve for carnallite + MgCl_{2},4H_{2}O. At the point K we have\r\nthe _highest temperature at which carnallite can exist with magnesium\r\nchloride in contact with solution_. Above this temperature decomposition\r\ntakes place and potassium chloride separates out.\r\n\r\nIf at the point E, at which the two single salts and the double salt are\r\npresent, excess of potassium chloride is added, the magnesium chloride will\r\nall disappear owing to the formation of carnallite, and there will be left\r\ncarnallite and potassium chloride. The solubility curve for a mixture of\r\nthese two salts is represented by EMK; a simple curve exhibiting, however,\r\na temperature maximum at M. This maximum point corresponds with the fact\r\nthat dry carnallite melts at this temperature with separation of potassium\r\nchloride. _At all temperatures {287} above this point, the formation of\r\ndouble salt is impossible_. The retroflex portion of the curve represents\r\nsolutions in equilibrium with carnallite and potassium chloride, but in\r\nwhich the ratio MgCl_{2} : KCl is greater than in the double salt.\r\n\r\nThroughout its whole course, _the curve EMK represents solutions in which\r\nthe ratio of MgCl_{2} : KCl is greater than in the double salt_. As this is\r\na point of some importance, it will be well, perhaps, to make it clearer by\r\ngiving one of the isothermal curves, _e.g._ the curve for 10deg, which is\r\nrepresented diagrammatically in Fig. 114.

One or\r\ntwo different cases will be very briefly described; and the reader should\r\nhave no difficulty in working out the behaviour under other conditions with\r\nthe help of the model and the numerical data just given. {289}\r\n\r\nIn the first place it may be again noted that at a temperature above\r\n167.5deg (point M) carnallite cannot exist. If, therefore, a solution of\r\nmagnesium and potassium chlorides is evaporated at a temperature above this\r\npoint, the result will be a mixture of potassium chloride and either\r\nmagnesium chloride tetrahydrate or magnesium chloride dihydrate, according\r\nas the temperature is below or above 176deg. The isothermal curve here\r\nconsists of only two branches.\r\n\r\nFurther, reference has already been made to the fact that all points of the\r\ncarnallite area correspond to solutions in equilibrium with carnallite, but\r\nin which the ratio of MgCl_{2} to KCl is greater than in the double salt. A\r\nsolution which is saturated with respect to double salt alone will be\r\nsupersaturated with respect to potassium chloride. At all temperatures,\r\ntherefore, carnallite is decomposed by water with separation of potassium\r\nchloride; hence all solutions obtained by adding excess of carnallite to\r\nwater will lie on the curve EM. _A pure saturated solution of carnallite\r\ncannot be obtained._\r\n\r\nIf an unsaturated solution of the two salts in equimolecular amounts is\r\nevaporated, potassium chloride will first be deposited, because the plane\r\nbisecting the right angle formed by the X and Y axes cuts the area for that\r\nsalt. Deposition of potassium chloride will lead to a relative increase in\r\nthe concentration of magnesium chloride in the solution; and on continued\r\nevaporation a point (on the curve EM) will be reached at which carnallite\r\nwill separate out. So long as the two solid phases are present, the\r\ncomposition of the solution must remain unchanged. Since the separation of\r\ncarnallite causes a decrease in the relative concentration of the potassium\r\nchloride in the solution, the portion of this salt which was deposited at\r\nthe commencement must _redissolve_, and carnallite will be left on\r\nevaporating to dryness. (_Incongruently saturated solution._)\r\n\r\nAlthough carnallite is decomposed by pure water, it will be possible to\r\ncrystallize it from a solution having a composition represented by any\r\npoint in the carnallite area. Since during the separation of the double\r\nsalt the relative amount of magnesium chloride increases, it is most\r\nadvantageous to {290} commence with a solution the composition of which is\r\nrepresented by a point lying just above the curve EM (cf. p. 281).\r\n\r\nFrom the above description of the behaviour of carnallite in solution, the\r\nprocesses usually employed for obtaining potassium chloride will be readily\r\nintelligible.[367]\r\n\r\nFerric Chloride--Hydrogen Chloride--Water.--In the case of another system\r\nof three components which we shall now describe, the relationships are\r\nconsiderably more complicated than in those already discussed. They deserve\r\ndiscussion, however, on account of the fact that they exhibit a number of\r\nnew phenomena.\r\n\r\nIn the system formed by the three components, ferric chloride, hydrogen\r\nchloride, and water, not only can various compounds of ferric chloride and\r\nwater (p. 152), and of hydrogen chloride and water be formed, each of which\r\npossesses a definite melting point, but various ternary compounds are also\r\nknown. Thus we have the following solid phases:--\r\n\r\n  2FeCl_{3},12H_{2}O   HCl,3H_{2}O   2FeCl_{3},2HCl,12H_{2}O\r\n  2FeCl_{3},7H_{2}O    HCl,2H_{2}O   2FeCl_{3},2HCl,8H_{2}O\r\n  2FeCl_{3},5H_{2}O    HCl,H_{2}O    2FeCl_{3},2HCl,4H_{2}O\r\n  2FeCl_{3},4H_{2}O\r\n  FeCl_{3}\r\n\r\nFrom this it will be readily understood that the complete study of the\r\nconditions of temperature and concentration under which solutions can\r\nexist, either with one solid phase or with two or three solid phases, are\r\nexceedingly complicated; and, as a matter of fact, only a few of the\r\npossible equilibria have been investigated. We shall attempt here only a\r\nbrief description of the most important of these.[368]\r\n\r\nIf we again employ rectangular co-ordinates for the graphic {291}\r\nrepresentation of the results, we have the two planes XOT and YOT (Fig.\r\n115): the concentration of ferric chloride being measured along the X-axis,\r\nthe concentration of hydrogen chloride along the Y-axis, and the\r\ntemperature along the T-axis. The curve ABCDEFGHJK is, therefore, the\r\nsolubility curve of ferric chloride in water (p. 152), and the curve\r\nA'B'C'D'E'F' the solubility curve of hydrogen chloride and its hydrates. B'\r\nand D' are the melting points of the hydrates HCl,3H_{2}O and HCl,2H_{2}O.\r\nIn the space between these two planes are represented those systems in\r\nwhich all three components are present. As already stated, only a few of\r\nthe possible ternary systems have been investigated, and these are\r\nrepresented in Fig. 116. The figure shows the model resting on the\r\nXOT-plane, so that the lower edge represents the solubility curve of ferric\r\nchloride, the concentration increasing from right to left. The\r\nconcentration of hydrogen chloride is measured upwards, and the temperature\r\nforwards. The further end of the model represents the isothermal surface\r\nfor -30deg. The surface of the model on the left does not correspond with\r\nthe plane YOT in Fig. 115, but with a parallel plane which cuts the\r\nconcentration axis for ferric chloride at a point representing 65\r\ngm.-molecules FeCl_{3} in 100 gm.-molecules of water. The upper surface\r\ncorresponds with a plane parallel to the axis XOT, at a distance\r\ncorresponding with the concentration of 50 gm.-molecules HCl in 100\r\ngm.-molecules of water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 115.]\r\n\r\nTernary Systems.--We pass over the binary system FeCl_{3}--H_{2}O, which\r\nhas already been discussed (p. 152), and the similar system HCl--H_{2}O\r\n(see Fig. 115), and turn to the discussion of some of the ternary systems\r\nrepresented by {292} points on the surface of the model between the planes\r\nXOT and YOT. As in the case of carnallite, a plane represents the\r\nconditions of concentration of solution and temperature under which a\r\nternary solution can be in equilibrium with a _single_ solid phase\r\n(bivariant systems), a line represents the conditions for the coexistence\r\nof a solution with two solid phases (univariant systems), and a point the\r\nconditions for equilibrium with three solid phases (invariant systems).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 116.]\r\n\r\nIn the case of a binary system, in which 2FeCl_{3},12H_{2}O is in\r\nequilibrium with a solution of the same composition, addition of hydrogen\r\nchloride must evidently lower the temperature at which equilibrium can\r\nexist; and the same holds, of course, {293} for all other binary solutions\r\nin equilibrium with this solid phase. In this way we obtain the surface I.,\r\nwhich represents the temperatures and concentrations of solutions in which\r\n2FeCl_{3},12H_{2}O can be in equilibrium with a ternary solution containing\r\nferric chloride, hydrogen chloride, and water. This surface is analogous to\r\nthe curved surface K_{1}K_{2}_k__{4}_k__{3} in Fig. 97 (p. 256). Similarly,\r\nthe surfaces II., III., IV., and V. represent the conditions for\r\nequilibrium between the solid phases 2FeCl_{3},7H_{2}O; 2FeCl_{3},5H_{2}O;\r\n2FeCl_{3},4H_{2}O; FeCl_{3} and ternary solutions respectively. The lines\r\nCL, EM, GN, and IO on the model represent univariant systems in which a\r\nternary solution is in equilibrium with two solid phases, viz. with those\r\nrepresented by the adjoining fields. These lines correspond with the\r\nternary eutectic curves _k__{3}K_{1} and _k__{4}K_{2} in Fig. 97. Besides\r\nthe surfaces already mentioned, there are still three others, VI., VII.,\r\nand VIII., which also represent the conditions for equilibrium between one\r\nsolid phase and a ternary solution; but in these cases, the solid phase is\r\nnot a binary compound or an anhydrous salt, but a ternary compound\r\ncontaining all three components. The solid phases which are in equilibrium\r\nwith the ternary solutions represented by the surfaces VI., VII., and\r\nVIII., are 2FeCl_{3},2HCl,4H_{2}O; 2FeCl_{3},2HCl,8H_{2}O; and\r\n2FeCl_{3},2HCl,12H_{2}O respectively.\r\n\r\nThe model for FeCl_{3}--HCl--H_{2}O exhibits certain other peculiarities\r\nnot found in the case of MgCl_{2}--KCl--H_{2}O. On examining the model more\r\nclosely, it is found that the field of the ternary compound\r\n2FeCl_{3},2HCl,8H_{2}O (VII.) resembles the surface of a sugar cone, and\r\nhas a projecting point, the end of which corresponds with a higher\r\ntemperature than does any other point of the surface. At the point of\r\nmaximum temperature the composition of the liquid phase is the same as that\r\nof the solid. This point, therefore, represents the melting point of the\r\ndouble salt of the above composition.\r\n\r\nThe curves representing univariant systems are of two kinds. In the one\r\ncase, the two solid phases present are both binary compounds; or one is a\r\nbinary compound and the other is one of the components. In the other case,\r\neither one or both solid phases are ternary compounds. Curves belonging\r\n{294} to the former class (so-called _border curves_) start from binary\r\neutectic points, and their course is always towards lower temperatures,\r\n_e.g._ CL, EM, GN, IO. Curves belonging to the latter class (so-called\r\n_medial curves_) would, in a triangular diagram, lie entirely within the\r\ntriangle. Such curves are YV, WV, VL, LM, MV, NS, ST, SO, OZ. These curves\r\ndo not always run from higher to lower temperatures, but may even exhibit a\r\npoint of maximum temperature. Such maxima are found, for example, at U\r\n(Fig. 116), and also on the curves ST and LV.\r\n\r\nFinally, whereas all the other ternary univariant curves run in valleys\r\nbetween the adjoining surfaces, we find at the point X a similar appearance\r\nto that found in the case of carnallite, as the univariant curve here rises\r\nabove the surrounding surface. The point X, therefore, does not correspond\r\nwith a eutectic point, but with a transition point. At this point the\r\nternary compound 2FeCl_{3},2HCl,12H_{2}O melts with separation of\r\n2FeCl_{3},12H_{2}O, just as carnallite melts at 168deg with separation of\r\npotassium chloride.\r\n\r\nThe Isothermal Curves.--A deeper insight into the behaviour of the system\r\nFeCl_{3}--HCl--H_{2}O is obtained from a study of the isothermal curves,\r\nthe complete series of which, so far as they have been studied, is given in\r\nFig. 117.[369] In this figure the lightly drawn curves represent isothermal\r\nsolubility curves, the particular temperature being printed beside the\r\ncurve.[370] The dark lines give the composition of the univariant systems\r\nat different temperatures. The point of intersection of a dark with a light\r\ncurve gives the composition of the univariant solution at the temperature\r\nrepresented by the light curve; and the point of intersection of two dark\r\nlines gives the composition of the invariant solution in equilibrium with\r\nthree solid phases. The dotted lines represent metastable systems, and the\r\npoints P, Q, and R represent solutions of {295} the composition of the\r\nternary salts, 2FeCl_{3},2HCl,4H_{2}O; 2FeCl_{3},2HCl,8H_{2}O; and\r\n2FeCl_{3},2HCl,12H_{2}O.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 117.]\r\n\r\nThe farther end of the model (Fig. 116) corresponds, as already mentioned,\r\nto the temperature -30deg, so that the outline evidently represents the\r\nisothermal curve for that temperature. Fig. 117 does not show this.\r\nWe can, however, follow the isothermal for -20deg, which is the extreme\r\ncurve on the right in Fig. 117. Point A represents the solubility\r\nof 2FeCl_{3},12H_{2}O in water. If hydrogen chloride is added, the\r\nconcentration of ferric chloride in the solution first decreases\r\nand then increases, until at point 34 the ternary double salt\r\n2FeCl_{3},2HCl,12H_{2}O is formed. If the addition of hydrogen chloride is\r\ncontinued, the ferric chloride disappears ultimately, and only the ternary\r\ndouble salt remains. This salt can coexist with solutions of the\r\ncomposition represented by the curve which passes through the points 173,\r\n174, 175. At the last-mentioned point, the ternary salt with 8H_{2}O is\r\nformed. The composition of the solutions with which this salt is in\r\nequilibrium at -20deg is represented by the curve which passes through a\r\npoint of maximal concentration with respect to HCl, and cuts the curve SN\r\nat the point 112, at which the solution is in equilibrium with the two\r\nsolid phases 2FeCl_{3},4H_{2}O and 2FeCl_{3},2HCl,8H_{2}O. The succeeding\r\nportion of the isotherm represents the solubility curve at -20deg of\r\n2FeCl_{3},4H_{2}O, which cuts the dark line OS at point 113, at which the\r\nsolution is in equilibrium with the two solid phases 2FeCl_{3},4H_{2}O and\r\n2FeCl_{3},2HCl,4H_{2}O. Thereafter comes the solubility curve of the latter\r\ncompound.\r\n\r\nThe other isothermal curves can be followed in a similar manner. If the\r\ntemperature is raised, the region of existence of the ternary double salts\r\nbecomes smaller and smaller, and at temperatures above 30deg the ternary\r\nsalts with 12H_{2}O and 8H_{2}O are no longer capable of existing. If the\r\ntemperature is raised above 46deg, only the binary compounds of ferric\r\nchloride and water and the anhydrous salt can exist as solid phases.\r\nThe isothermal curve for 0deg represents the solubility curve for\r\n2FeCl_{3},12H_{2}O; 2FeCl_{3},7H_{2}O; 2FeCl_{3},5H_{2}O; and\r\n2FeCl_{3},4H_{2}O. {296}\r\n\r\nFinally, in the case of the system FeCl_{3}--HCl--H_{2}O, we find\r\n_closed_ isothermal curves. Since, as already stated, the salt\r\n2FeCl_{3},2HCl,8H_{2}O has a definite melting point, the temperature\r\nof which is therefore higher than that at which this compound is in\r\nequilibrium with solutions of other composition, it follows that the line\r\nof intersection of an isothermal plane corresponding with a temperature\r\nimmediately below the melting point of the salt with the cone-shaped\r\nsurface of its region of existence, will form a closed curve. This is shown\r\nby the isotherm for -4.5deg, which surrounds the point Q, the melting point\r\nof the ternary salt.\r\n\r\nThe following table gives some of the numerical data from which the curves\r\nand the model have been constructed:--\r\n\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n         |                             |          | Composition of the sol-\r\n         |                             |          | ution in gm.-mols. salt\r\n  Point. |         Solid phases.       | Temper-  | to 100 gm.-mols. water.\r\n         |                             |  ature.  |------------------------\r\n         |                             |          |   HCl   |  FeCl_{3}\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  A      | 2FeCl_{3},12H_{2}O          | -20deg   |   --    |   6.56\r\n         |                             |          |         |\r\n  C      |{ 2FeCl_{3},12H_{2}O;       }|  27.4deg |   --    |  24.30\r\n         |{ 2FeCl_{3},7H_{2}O         }|          |         |\r\n         |                             |          |         |\r\n  E      |{ 2FeCl_{3},7H_{2}O;        }|  30deg   |   --    |  30.24\r\n         |{ 2FeCl_{3},5H_{2}O         }|          |         |\r\n         |                             |          |         |\r\n  G      |{ 2FeCl_{3},5H_{2}O;        }|  55deg   |   --    |  40.64\r\n         |{ 2FeCl_{3},4H_{2}O         }|          |         |\r\n         |                             |          |         |\r\n  J      | 2FeCl_{3},4H_{2}O; FeCl_{3} |  66deg   |   --    |  58.40\r\n         |                             |          |         |\r\n         |{ 2FeCl_{3},12H_{2}O;       }|          |         |\r\n  L      |{ 2FeCl_{3},7H_{2}O;        }|  -7.5deg |  19.22  |  23.72\r\n         |{ 2FeCl_{3},2HCl,8H_{2}O    }|          |         |\r\n         |                             |          |         |\r\n         |{ 2FeCl_{3},7H_{2}O;        }|          |         |\r\n  M      |{ 2FeCl_{3},5H_{2}O;        }|  -7.3deg |  23.08  |  28.55\r\n         |{ 2FeCl_{3},2HCl,8H_{2}O    }|          |         |\r\n         |                             |          |         |\r\n         |{ 2FeCl_{3},5H_{2}O;        }|          |         |\r\n  N      |{ 2FeCl_{3},4H_{2}O;        }| -16deg   |  28.40  |  31.89\r\n         |{ 2FeCl_{3},2HCl,8H_{2}O    }|          |         |\r\n         |                             |          |         |\r\n         |{ 2FeCl_{3},4H_{2}O;        }|          |         |\r\n  S      |{ 2FeCl_{3},2HCl,8H_{2}O;   }| -27.5deg |  32.33  |  34.21\r\n         |{ 2FeCl_{3},2HCl,4H_{2}O    }|          |         |\r\n         |                             |          |         |\r\n         |{ 2FeCl_{3},4H_{2}O;        }|          |         |\r\n  O      |{ FeCl_{3};                 }|  29deg   |  33.71  |  49.84\r\n         |{ 2FeCl_{3},2HCl,4H_{2}O    }|          |         |\r\n         |                             |          |         |\r\n  U      |{ 2FeCl_{3},7H_{2}O;        }|  -4.5deg |  20.66  |  25.74\r\n         |{ 2FeCl_{3},2HCl,8H_{2}O    }|          |         |\r\n         |                             |          |         |\r\n         |{ 2FeCl_{3},12H_{2}O;       }|          |         |\r\n  V      |{ 2FeCl_{3},2HCl,12H_{2}O;  }| -13deg   |  22.40  |  18.00\r\n         |{ 2FeCl_{3},2HCl,8H_{2}O    }|          |         |\r\n         |                             |          |         |\r\n  X      |{ 2FeCl_{3},12H_{2}O;       }| -12.5deg |  22.14  |  16.69\r\n         |{ 2FeCl_{3},2HCl,12H_{2}O   }|          |         |\r\n         |                             |          |         |\r\n  Q      | 2FeCl_{3},2HCl,8H_{2}O      |  -3deg (melting point)\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nBasic Salts.--Another class of systems in the study of {297} which the\r\nPhase Rule has performed exceptional service, is that of the basic salts.\r\nIn many cases it is impossible, by the ordinary methods of analysis, to\r\ndecide whether one is dealing with a definite chemical individual or with a\r\nmixture. The question whether a solid phase is a chemical individual can,\r\nhowever, be answered, in most cases, with the help of the principles which\r\nwe have already learnt. Let us consider, for example, the formation of\r\nbasic salts from bismuth nitrate, and water. In this case we can choose as\r\ncomponents Bi_{2}O_{3}, N_{2}O_{5}, and H_{2}O; since all the systems\r\nconsist of these in varying amounts. If we are dealing with a condition of\r\nequilibrium at constant temperature between liquid and solid phases, three\r\ncases can be distinguished,[371] viz.--\r\n\r\n1. The solutions in different experiments have the same composition, but\r\nthe composition of the precipitate alters. In this case there must be two\r\nsolid phases.\r\n\r\n2. The solutions in different experiments can have varying composition,\r\nwhile the composition of the precipitate remains unchanged. In this case\r\nonly one solid phase exists, a definite compound.\r\n\r\n3. The composition both of the solution and of the precipitate varies. In\r\nthis case the solid phase is a solid solution or a mixed crystal.\r\n\r\nIn order, therefore, to decide what is the nature of a precipitate produced\r\nby the hydrolysis of a normal salt, it is only necessary to ascertain\r\nwhether and how the composition of the precipitate alters with alteration\r\nin the composition of the solution. If the composition of the solution is\r\nrepresented by abscissae, and the composition of the precipitate by\r\nordinates, the form of the curves obtained would enable us to answer our\r\nquestion; for vertical lines would indicate the presence of two solid\r\nphases (1st case), horizontal lines the presence of only one solid phase\r\n(2nd case), and slanting lines the presence of mixed crystals (3rd case).\r\nThis method of representation cannot, however, be carried out in most\r\ncases. It is, however, {298} generally possible to find one pair or several\r\npairs of components, the _relative amounts_ of which in the solution or in\r\nthe precipitate undergo change when, and only when, the composition of the\r\nsolution or of the precipitate changes. Thus, in the case of bismuth,\r\nnitrate, and water, we can represent the ratio of Bi_{2}O_{3} : N_{2}O_{5}\r\nin the precipitate as ordinates, and N_{2}O_{5} : H_{2}O in the solution as\r\nabscissae. A horizontal line then indicates a single solid phase, and a\r\nvertical line two solid phases. An example of this is given in Fig.\r\n118.[372]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 118.]\r\n\r\nBi_{2}O_{3}--N_{2}O_{5}--H_{2}O.--Although various systems have been\r\nstudied in which there is formation of basic salts,[373] we shall content\r\nourselves here with the description of some of the conditions for the\r\nformation of basic salts of bismuth nitrate, and for their equilibrium in\r\ncontact with solutions.[374]\r\n\r\nThree normal salts of bismuth oxide and nitric acid are known, viz.\r\nBi_{2}O_{3},3N_{2}O_{5},10H_{2}O(S_{10});\r\nBi_{2}O_{3},3N_{2}O_{5},4H_{2}O(S_{4}); and\r\nBi_{2}O_{3},3N_{2}O_{5},3H_{2}O(S_{3}). Besides these normal salts, there\r\nare the following basic salts:--\r\n\r\n{299}\r\n\r\n  Bi_{2}O_{3},N_{2}O_{5},2H_{2}O   (represented by B_{1-1-2})\r\n  Bi_{2}O_{3},N_{2}O_{5},H_{2}O    (     \"      \"  B_{1-1-1})\r\n  6Bi_{2}O_{3},5N_{2}O_{5},9H_{2}O (     \"      \"  B_{6-5-9})\r\n  2Bi_{2}O_{3},N_{2}O_{5},H_{2}O   (     \"      \"  B_{2-1-1})\r\n\r\nProbably some others also exist. The problem now is to find the conditions\r\nunder which these different normal and basic salts can be in equilibrium\r\nwith solutions of varying concentration of the three components. Having\r\ndetermined the equilibrium conditions for the different salts, it is then\r\npossible to construct a model similar to that for MgCl_{2}--KCl--H_{2}O or\r\nfor FeCl_{3}--HCl--H_{2}O, from which it will be possible to determine the\r\nlimits of stability of the different salts, and to predict what will occur\r\nwhen we bring the salts in contact with solutions of nitric acid of\r\ndifferent concentrations and at different temperatures.\r\n\r\nFor our present purpose it is sufficient to pick out only some of the\r\nequilibria which have been studied, and which are represented in the model\r\n(Fig. 119). In this case use has been made of the triangular method of\r\nrepresentation, so that the surface of the model lies within the prism.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 119.]\r\n\r\nThis model shows the three surfaces, A, B, and C, which represent the\r\nconditions for the stable existence of the salts B_{1-1-1}, S_{10}, and\r\nS_{3} in contact with solution at different {300} temperatures. The front\r\nsurface of the model represents the temperature 9deg, and the farther end\r\nthe temperature 75.5deg. The dotted curve represents the isotherm for\r\n20deg. The prominences between the surfaces represent, of course, solutions\r\nwhich are saturated in respect of two solid phases. Thus, for example,\r\n_pabc_ represents solutions in equilibrium with B_{1-1-1} and S_{10}; and\r\nthe ridge _qdc_, solutions in equilibrium with S_{10} and S_{3}. The point\r\n_b_, which lies at 75.5deg, is the point of maximum temperature for S_{10}.\r\nIf the temperature is raised above this point, S_{10} decomposes into the\r\nbasic salt B_{1-1-1} and solution. This point is therefore analogous to the\r\npoint M in the carnallite model, at which this salt decomposes into\r\npotassium chloride and solution (p. 284); or to the point at which the salt\r\n2FeCl_{3},2HCl,12H_{2}O decomposes into 2FeCl_{3},12H_{2}O and solution\r\n(p. 294). The curve _pab_ has been followed to the temperature of 72deg\r\n(point _c_). The end of the model is incomplete, but it is probable that in\r\nthe neighbourhood of the point _c_ there exists a quintuple point at which\r\nthe basic salt B_{1-2-2} appears. In the neighbourhood of _e_ also there\r\nprobably exists another quintuple point at which S_{4} is formed. These\r\nsystems have, however, not been studied.\r\n\r\nThe following tables give some of the numerical data:--\r\n\r\n  ISOTHERM FOR 20deg.\r\n\r\n  ----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n                               | Composition of the solution.

In this case\r\nwe should obtain, as before (Fig. 120), the isotherm _adcb_, if we express\r\nthe {302} composition of the solution in gram-molecules of A or of B to 100\r\ngram-molecules of water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 120.]\r\n\r\nLet us suppose, now, that the double salt is in equilibrium with the\r\nsolution at a definite temperature, and that the composition of the\r\nsolution is represented by the point e. The greater part of the solution is\r\nnow separated from the solid phase, and the latter, _together with the\r\nadhering mother liquor_, is analyzed. The composition (expressed, as\r\nbefore, in gram-molecules of A and B to 100 gram molecules of water) will\r\nbe represented by a point (_e.g._ _f_) on the line _e_S, where S represents\r\nthe composition of the double salt. That this is so will be evident when\r\none considers that the composition of the whole mass must lie between the\r\ncomposition of the solution and that of the double salt, no matter what the\r\nrelative amounts of the solid phase and the mother liquor.\r\n\r\nIf, in a similar manner, we analyze a solution of a different composition\r\nin equilibrium with the same double salt (not necessarily at the same\r\ntemperature as before), and also the mixture of solid phase and solution,\r\nwe shall obtain two other points, as, for example, _g_ and _h_, and the\r\nline joining these must likewise pass through S. The method of finding the\r\n{303} composition of an unknown double salt consists, therefore, in\r\nfinding, in the manner just described, the position of two lines such as\r\n_ef_ and _gh_. The point of intersection of these lines then gives the\r\ncomposition of the double salt.\r\n\r\nIf the double salt is anhydrous, the point S lies at infinity, and the\r\nlines _ef_ and _gh_ are parallel to each other.\r\n\r\nThe same result is arrived at by means of the triangular method of\r\nrepresentation.[377] If we start with the three components in known\r\namounts, and represent the initial composition of the whole by a point in\r\nthe triangle, and then ascertain the final composition of the solution in\r\nequilibrium with the solid phase at a definite temperature, the line\r\njoining the points representing the initial and end concentration passes\r\nthrough the point representing the composition of the solid phase. If two\r\ndeterminations are made with solutions having different initial and final\r\nconcentrations in equilibrium with the same solid phase, then the point of\r\nintersection of the two lines so obtained gives the composition of the\r\nsolid phase.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{304}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nABSENCE OF A LIQUID PHASE\r\n\r\nIn the preceding chapters dealing with equilibria in three-component\r\nsystems, our attention was directed only to those cases in which liquid\r\nsolutions formed one or more phases. Mention must, however, be made of\r\ncertain systems which contain no liquid phase, and in which only solids and\r\ngases are in equilibrium. Since, in all cases, there can be but one gas\r\nphase, four solid phases will be necessary in order to form an invariant\r\nsystem. When only three solid phases are present, the system is univariant;\r\nand when only two solid phases coexist with gas, it is bivariant. If,\r\nhowever, we make the restriction that the gas pressure is constant, we\r\ndiminish the variability by one.\r\n\r\nOn account of their great industrial importance, we shall describe briefly\r\nsome of the systems belonging to this class.\r\n\r\nIron, Carbon Monoxide, Carbon Dioxide.--Some of the most important systems\r\nof three components in which equilibrium exists between solid and gas\r\nphases are those formed by the three components--iron, carbon monoxide, and\r\ncarbon dioxide--and they are of importance especially for the study of the\r\nprocesses occurring in the blast furnace.\r\n\r\nIf carbon monoxide is passed over reduced iron powder at a temperature of\r\nabout 600deg, the iron is oxidized and the carbon monoxide reduced with\r\nseparation of carbon in accordance with the equation\r\n\r\n  Fe + CO = FeO + C\r\n\r\nThis reaction is succeeded by the two reactions\r\n\r\n  FeO + CO = Fe + CO_{2}\r\n    CO_{2} + C = 2CO\r\n\r\n{305}\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 121.]\r\n\r\nThe former of these reactions is not complete, but leads to a definite\r\nequilibrium. The result of the different reactions is therefore an\r\nequilibrium between the three solid phases, carbon, iron, and ferrous\r\noxide, and the gas phase consisting of carbon monoxide and dioxide. We have\r\nhere four phases; and if the total pressure is maintained constant,\r\nequilibrium can occur only at a definite temperature.\r\n\r\nSince, under certain conditions, we can also have the reaction\r\n\r\n  Fe_{3}O_{4} + CO = 3FeO + CO_{2}\r\n\r\n{306} a second series of equilibria can be obtained of a character similar\r\nto the former. These various equilibria have been investigated by Baur and\r\nGlaessner,[378] and the following is a short account of the results of\r\ntheir work.\r\n\r\nMixtures of the solid phases in equilibrium with carbon monoxide and\r\ndioxide were heated in a porcelain tube at a definite temperature until\r\nequilibrium was produced, and the gas was then pumped off and analyzed. The\r\nresults which were obtained are given in the following tables, and\r\nrepresented graphically in Fig. 121.\r\n\r\n  SOLID PHASES: Fe_{3}O_{4}; FeO.\r\n\r\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n      |             | Duration of    |              | Percentage of\r\n  No. | Tube filled | the experiment | Temperature. |\r\n      |    with     | in hours.      |              | CO_{2} | CO\r\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n    1 |    CO       |       14       |    600deg    |  59.3  | 40.7\r\n    2 |    CO       |       15       |    590deg    |  54.7  | 45.3\r\n    3 |    CO_{2}   |       16       |    590deg    |  64.6  | 35.4\r\n    4 |    CO       |       24       |    590deg    |  58.4  | 41.6\r\n    5 |    CO       |       22       |    730deg    |  67.7  | 32.3\r\n    6 |    CO_{2}   |       22       |    730deg    |  86.1  | 31.9\r\n    7 |    CO       |       22       |    750deg    |  68.4  | 31.6\r\n    8 |    CO_{2}   |       22       |    610deg    |  64.9  | 35.1\r\n    9 |    CO       |       23       |    420deg    |  56.0  | 44.0\r\n   10 |    CO       |       47       |    350deg    |  65.6  | 34.4\r\n   11 |    CO_{2}   |       46       |    350deg    |  72.8  | 27.2\r\n   12 |    CO       |       53       |    350deg    |  64.0  | 36.0\r\n   13 |    CO       |       18       |    570deg    |  53.4  | 46.6\r\n   14 |    CO       |       19       |    680deg    |  60.5  | 39.5\r\n   15 |    CO_{2}   |       24       |    540deg    |  55.5  | 44.5\r\n   16 |    CO       |       21       |    630deg    |  57.5  | 42.5\r\n   17 |    CO_{2}   |       17       |    690deg    |  65.5  | 34.5\r\n   18 |    CO_{2}   |       17       |    670deg    |  67.0  | 33.0\r\n   19 |    CO_{2}   |       24       |    410deg    |  58.5  | 41.5\r\n   20 |    CO       |       24       |    490deg    |  51.7  | 48.8\r\n   21 |    CO_{2}   |       23       |    590deg    |  54.4  | 45.6\r\n   22 |    CO_{2}   |        4       |    950deg    |  77.0  | 23.0\r\n   23 |    CO_{2}   |       15       |    850deg    |  73.4  | 26.6\r\n   24 |    CO       |        8       |    800deg    |  71.2  | 28.8\r\n   25 |    CO_{2}   |       24       |    540deg    |  56.7  | 43.3\r\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n{307}\r\n\r\n  SOLID PHASES: FeO; Fe.\r\n\r\n  ------+-------------+-------------+--------------+---------------\r\n        |             | Duration of |              | Percentage of\r\n   No.  | Tube filled | experiment  | Temperature. |\r\n        | with        | in hours.   |              | CO_{2} |  CO\r\n  ------+-------------+-------------+--------------+--------+------\r\n  I.    |    CO       |      15     |    800deg    |  35.2  | 64.8\r\n  II.   |    CO       |      18     |    530deg    |  29.1  | 70.9\r\n  III.  |    CO       |      13     |    880deg    |  30.2  | 69.6\r\n  IV.   |    CO_{2}   |      24     |    870deg    |  32.3  | 67.7\r\n  V.    |    CO       |      18     |    760deg    |  36.9  | 63.1\r\n  VI.   |    CO_{2}   |      16     |    820deg    |  34.7  | 65.3\r\n  VII.  |    CO_{2}   |      18     |    730deg    |  41.1  | 58.9\r\n  VIII. |    CO       |      18     |    630deg    |  34.9  | 65.1\r\n  IX.   |    CO_{2}   |      17     |    630deg    |  61.6  | 58.4\r\n  X.    |    CO       |      18     |    540deg    |  25.0  | 75.0\r\n  XI.   |    CO_{2}   |      25     |    540deg    |  36.5  | 63.5\r\n  ------+-------------+-------------+--------------+--------+------\r\n\r\nAs is evident from the above tables and from the curves in Fig. 121, the\r\ncurve of equilibrium in the case of the reaction\r\n\r\n  Fe_{3}O_{4} + CO = 3FeO + CO_{2}\r\n\r\nexhibits a maximum for the ratio CO : CO_{2}, at 490deg, while, for the\r\nreaction\r\n\r\n  FeO + CO = Fe + CO_{2}\r\n\r\nthis ratio has a minimum value at 680deg. From these curves can be derived\r\nthe conditions under which the different solid phases can exist in contact\r\nwith gas. Thus, for example, at a temperature of 690deg, FeO and\r\nFe_{3}O_{4} can coexist with a mixture of 65.5 per cent. of CO_{2} and 34.5\r\nper cent. of CO. If the partial pressure of CO_{2} is increased, there\r\noccurs the reaction\r\n\r\n  3FeO + CO_{2} = Fe_{3}O_{4} + CO\r\n\r\nand if carbon dioxide is added in sufficient amount, the ferrous oxide\r\nfinally disappears completely. If, on the other hand, the partial pressure\r\nof CO is increased, there occurs the reaction\r\n\r\n  Fe_{3}O_{4} + CO = 3FeO + CO_{2}\r\n\r\nand all the ferric oxide can be made to disappear. We see, therefore, that\r\nFe_{3}O_{4} can only exist at temperatures and in {308} contact with\r\nmixtures of carbon monoxide and dioxide, represented by the area which lies\r\nbelow the under curve in Fig. 121. Similarly, the region of existence of\r\nFeO is that represented by the area between the two curves; while metallic\r\niron can exist under the conditions of temperature and composition of gas\r\nphase represented by the area above the upper curve in Fig. 121. If,\r\ntherefore, ferric oxide or metallic iron is heated for a sufficiently long\r\ntime at temperatures above 700deg (to the right of the dotted line; _vide\r\ninfra_), complete transformation to ferrous oxide finally occurs.\r\n\r\nIn another series of equilibria which can be obtained, carbon is one of the\r\nsolid phases. In Fig. 121 the equilibria between carbon, carbon monoxide,\r\nand carbon dioxide under pressures of one and of a quarter atmosphere, are\r\nrepresented by dotted lines.[379]\r\n\r\nIf we consider only the dotted line on the right, representing the\r\nequilibria under atmospheric pressure, we see that the points in which the\r\ndotted line cuts the other two curves must represent systems in which\r\ncarbon monoxide and carbon dioxide are in equilibrium with FeO +\r\nFe_{3}O_{4} + C, on the one hand, and with Fe + FeO + C on the other. These\r\nsystems can only exist at one definite temperature, if we make the\r\nrestriction that the pressure is maintained constant (atmospheric\r\npressure). Starting, therefore, with the equilibrium FeO + Fe_{3}O_{4} + CO\r\n+ CO_{2} at a temperature of about 670deg, and then add carbon to the\r\nsystem, the reaction\r\n\r\n  C + CO_{2} = 2CO\r\n\r\nwill occur, because the concentration of CO_{2} is greater than what\r\ncorresponds with the system FeO + Fe_{3}O_{4} + C in equilibrium with\r\ncarbon monoxide and dioxide. In consequence of this reaction, the\r\nequilibrium between FeO + Fe_{3}O_{4} and the gas phase is disturbed, and\r\nthe change in the composition of the gas phase is opposed by the reaction\r\nFe_{3}O_{4} + CO = 3FeO + CO_{2}, which continues until either all the\r\ncarbon {309} or all the ferric oxide is used up. If the ferric oxide first\r\ndisappears, the equilibrium corresponds with a point on the dotted line in\r\nthe middle area of Fig. 121, which represents equilibria between FeO + C as\r\nsolid phases, and a mixture of carbon monoxide and dioxide as gas phase. If\r\nthe temperature is higher than 685deg, at which temperature the curve for\r\nC--CO--CO_{2} cuts that for Fe--FeO--CO--CO_{2}; then, when all the ferric\r\noxide has disappeared, the concentration of CO_{2} is still too great for\r\nthe coexistence of FeO and C. Consequently, there occurs the reaction C +\r\nCO_{2} = 2CO, and the composition of the gas phase alters until a point on\r\nthe upper curve is reached. A further increase in the concentration of CO\r\nis opposed by the reaction FeO + CO = Fe + CO_{2}, and the pressure remains\r\nconstant until all the ferrous oxide is reduced and only iron and carbon\r\nremain in equilibrium with gas. If the quantities of the substances have\r\nbeen rightly chosen, we ultimately reach a point on the dotted curve in the\r\nupper part of Fig. 121.\r\n\r\nFig. 121 shows us, also, what are the conditions under which the reduction\r\nof ferric to ferrous oxide by carbon can occur. Let us suppose, for\r\nexample, that we start with a mixture of carbon monoxide and dioxide at\r\nabout 600deg (the lowest point on the dotted line), and maintain the total\r\npressure constant and equal to one atmosphere. If the temperature is\r\nincreased, the concentration of the carbon dioxide will diminish, owing to\r\nthe reaction C + CO_{2} = 2CO, but the ferric oxide will undergo no change\r\nuntil the temperature reaches 647deg, the point of intersection of the\r\ndotted curve with the curve for FeO and Fe_{3}O_{4}. At this point further\r\nincrease in the concentration of carbon monoxide is opposed by the\r\nreduction of ferric oxide in accordance with the equation Fe_{3}O_{4} + CO\r\n= 3FeO + CO_{2}. The pressure, therefore, remains constant until all the\r\nferric oxide has disappeared. If the temperature is still further raised,\r\nwe again obtain a univariant system, FeO + C, in equilibrium with gas\r\n(univariant because the total pressure is constant); and if the temperature\r\nis raised the composition of the gas must undergo change. This is effected\r\nby the reaction C + CO_{2} = 2CO. When the {310} temperature rises to\r\n685deg, at which the dotted curve cuts the curve for Fe--FeO, further\r\nchange is prevented by the reaction FeO + CO = Fe + CO_{2}. When all the\r\nferrous oxide is used up, we obtain the system Fe + C in equilibrium with\r\ngas. If the temperature is now raised, the composition of the gas undergoes\r\nchange, as shown by the dotted line. The two temperatures, 647deg and\r\n685deg, give, evidently, the limits within which ferric or ferrous oxide\r\ncan be reduced directly by carbon.\r\n\r\nIt is further evident that at any temperature to the right of the dotted\r\nline, carbon is unstable in presence of iron or its oxides; while at\r\ntemperatures lower than those represented by the dotted line, it is stable.\r\nIn the blast furnace, therefore, separation of carbon can occur only at\r\nlower temperatures, and the carbon must disappear on raising the\r\ntemperature.\r\n\r\nFinally, it may be remarked that the equilibrium curves show that ferrous\r\noxide is most easily reduced at 680deg, since the concentration of the\r\ncarbon monoxide required at this temperature is a minimum. On the other\r\nhand, ferric oxide is reduced with greatest difficulty at 490deg, since at\r\nthis temperature the requisite concentration of carbon monoxide is a\r\nmaximum.\r\n\r\nOther equilibria between solid and gas phases are: Equilibrium between\r\niron, ferric oxide, water vapour, and hydrogen,[380] and the equilibria\r\nbetween carbon, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, water vapour, and\r\nhydrogen,[381] which is of importance for the manufacture of water gas.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{311}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nSYSTEMS OF FOUR COMPONENTS\r\n\r\nIn the systems which have so far been studied, we have met with cases where\r\ntwo or three components could enter into combination; but in no case did we\r\nfind double decomposition occurring. The reason of this is that in the\r\nsystems previously studied, in which double decomposition might have been\r\npossible, namely in those systems in which two salts acted as components,\r\nthe restriction was imposed that either the basic or the acid constituent\r\nof these salts must be the same; a restriction imposed, indeed, for the\r\nvery purpose of excluding double decomposition. Now, however, we shall\r\nallow this restriction to fall, thereby extending the range of study.\r\n\r\nHitherto, in connection with four-component systems, the attention has been\r\ndirected solely to the study of aqueous solutions of salts, and more\r\nespecially of the salts which occur in sea-water, _i.e._ chiefly, the\r\nsulphates and chlorides of magnesium, potassium, and sodium. The importance\r\nof these investigations will be recognized when one recollects that by the\r\nevaporation of sea-water there have been formed the enormous salt-beds at\r\nStassfurt, which constitute at present the chief source of the sulphates\r\nand chlorides of magnesium and potassium. The investigations, therefore,\r\nare not only of great geological interest as tending to elucidate the\r\nconditions under which these salt-beds have been formed, but are of no less\r\nimportance for the industrial working of the deposits.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, not the intention to enter here into any detailed\r\ndescription of the different systems which have so far been studied, and of\r\nthe sometimes very complex relationships {312} met with, but merely to\r\nrefer briefly to some points of more general import in connection with\r\nthese systems.[382]\r\n\r\nReciprocal Salt-Pairs. Choice of Components.--When two salts undergo double\r\ndecomposition, the interaction can be expressed by an equation such as\r\n\r\n  NH_{4}Cl + NaNO_{3} = NaCl + NH_{4}NO_{3}\r\n\r\nSince one pair of salts--NaCl + NH_{4}NO_{3}--is formed from the other\r\npair--NH_{4}Cl + NaNO_{3}--by double decomposition, the two pairs of salts\r\nare known as _reciprocal salt-pairs_.[383] It is with systems in which the\r\ncomponent salts form reciprocal salt-pairs that we have to deal here.\r\n\r\nIt must be noted, however, that the four salts formed by two reciprocal\r\nsalt-pairs do not constitute a system of four, but only of _three_\r\ncomponents. This will be understood if it is recalled that only so many\r\nconstituents are taken as components as are necessary to _express_ the\r\ncomposition of all the phases present (p. 12). It will be seen, now, that\r\nthe composition of each of the four salts which can be present together can\r\nbe expressed in terms of three of them. Thus, for example, in the case of\r\nNH_{4}Cl, NaNO_{3}, NH_{4}NO_{3}, NaCl, we can express the composition of\r\nNH_{4}Cl by NH_{4}NO_{3} + NaCl - NaNO_{3}; or of NaNO_{3} by NH_{4}NO_{3}\r\n+ NaCl - NH_{4}Cl. In all these cases it will be seen that negative\r\nquantities of one of the components must be employed; but that we have seen\r\nto be quite permissible (p. 12). The number of components is, therefore,\r\nthree; but any three of the four salts can be chosen.\r\n\r\nSince, then, two reciprocal salt-pairs constitute only three {313}\r\ncomponents or independently variable constituents, another component is\r\nnecessary in order to obtain a four-component system. As such, we shall\r\nchoose water.\r\n\r\nTransition Point.--In the case of the formation of double salts from two\r\nsingle salts, we saw that there was a point--the _quintuple point_--at\r\nwhich five phases could coexist. This point we also saw to be a transition\r\npoint, on one side of which the double salt, on the other side the two\r\nsingle salts in contact with solution, were found to be the stable system.\r\nA similar behaviour is found in the case of reciprocal salt-pairs. The\r\nfour-component system, two reciprocal salt-pairs and water, can give rise\r\nto an invariant system in which the six phases, four salts, solution,\r\nvapour, can coexist; the temperature at which this is possible constitutes\r\na _sextuple point_. Now, this sextuple point is also a transition point, on\r\nthe one side of which the one salt-pair, on the other side the reciprocal\r\nsalt-pair, is stable in contact with solution.\r\n\r\nThe sextuple point is the point of intersection of the curves of six\r\nunivariant systems, viz. four solubility curves with three solid phases\r\neach, a vapour-pressure curve for the system: two reciprocal\r\nsalt-pairs--vapour; and a transition curve for the condensed system: two\r\nreciprocal salt-pairs--solution. If we omit the vapour phase and work under\r\natmospheric pressure (in open vessels), we find that the transition point\r\nis the point of intersection of four solubility curves.\r\n\r\nJust as in the case of three-component systems we saw that the presence of\r\none of the single salts along with the double salt was necessary in order\r\nto give a univariant system, so in the four-component systems the presence\r\nof a third salt is necessary as solid phase along with one of the\r\nsalt-pairs. In the case of the reciprocal salt-pairs mentioned above, the\r\ntransition point would be the point of intersection of the solubility\r\ncurves of the systems with the following groups of salts as solid phases:\r\nBelow the transition point: NH_{4}Cl + NaNO_{3} + NaCl; NH_{4}Cl + NaNO_{3}\r\n+ NH_{4}NO_{3}; above the transition point: NaCl + NH_{4}NO_{3} + NaNO_{3};\r\nNaCl + NH_{4}NO_{3} + NH_{4}Cl. From this we see that the two salts\r\nNH_{4}Cl and NaNO_{3} would be able to exist together with solution below\r\nthe transition point, but not above it. This transition point has not been\r\ndetermined. {314}\r\n\r\nFormation of Double Salts.--In all cases of four-component systems so far\r\nstudied, the transition points have not been points at which one salt-pair\r\npassed into its reciprocal, but at which a double salt was formed. Thus, at\r\n4.4deg Glauber's salt and potassium chloride form glaserite and sodium\r\nchloride, according to the equation\r\n\r\n  2Na_{2}SO_{4},10H_{2}O + 3KCl = K_{3}Na(SO_{4})_{2} + 3NaCl + 20H_{2}O\r\n\r\nAbove the transition point, therefore, there would be K_{3}Na(SO_{4})_{2},\r\nNaCl and KCl; and it may be considered that at a higher temperature the\r\ndouble salt would interact with the potassium chloride according to the\r\nequation\r\n\r\n  K_{3}Na(SO_{4})_{2} + KCl = 2K_{2}SO_{4} + NaCl\r\n\r\nthus giving the reciprocal of the original salt-pair. This point has,\r\nhowever, not been experimentally realized.[384]\r\n\r\nTransition Interval.--A double salt, we learned (p. 277), when brought in\r\ncontact with water at the transition point undergoes partial decomposition\r\nwith separation of one of the constituent salts; and only after a certain\r\nrange of temperature (transition interval) has been passed, can a pure\r\nsaturated solution be obtained. A similar behaviour is also found in the\r\ncase of reciprocal salt-pairs. If one of the salt-pairs is brought in\r\ncontact with water at the transition point, interaction will occur and one\r\nof the salts of the reciprocal salt-pair will be deposited; and this will\r\nbe the case throughout a certain range of temperature, after which it will\r\nbe possible to prepare a solution saturated only for the one salt-pair. In\r\nthe case of ammonium chloride and sodium nitrate the lower limit of the\r\ntransition interval is 5.5deg, so that above this temperature and up to\r\nthat of the transition point (unknown), ammonium chloride and sodium\r\nnitrate in contact with water would give rise to a third salt by double\r\ndecomposition, in this case to sodium chloride.[385]\r\n\r\n{315}\r\n\r\nGraphic Representation.--For the graphic representation of systems of four\r\ncomponents, four axes may be chosen intersecting at a point like the edges\r\nof a regular octahedron (Fig. 122).[386] Along these different axes the\r\nequivalent molecular amounts of the different salts are measured.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 122.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 123.]\r\n\r\nTo represent a given system consisting of _x_B, _y_C, and _z_D in a given\r\namount of water (where B, C, and D represent equivalent molecular amounts\r\nof the salts), measure off on OB and OC lengths equal to _x_ and _y_\r\nrespectively. The point of intersection _a_ (Fig. 122) represents a\r\nsolution containing _x_B and _y_C (_ab_ = _x_; _ac_ = _y_). From _a_ a line\r\n_a_P is drawn parallel to OD and equal to _z_. P then represents the\r\nsolution of the above composition.\r\n\r\nIt is usual, however, not to employ the three-dimensional figure, but its\r\nhorizontal and vertical projections. Fig. 122, if projected on the base of\r\nthe octahedron, would yield a diagram such as is shown in Fig. 123. The\r\nprojection of the edges of the octahedron form two axes at right angles and\r\ngive rise to four quadrants similar to those employed for the\r\nrepresentation of ternary solutions (p. 273). Here, the point _a_\r\nrepresents a ternary solution saturated with respect to B and C; and _a_P,\r\nquaternary solutions in equilibrium with the same two salts as solid\r\nphases. Such a diagram represents the conditions of equilibrium only for\r\none definite temperature, and corresponds, therefore, to the isothermal\r\ndiagrams for ternary systems (p. 273). In such a diagram, since the\r\ntemperature and {316} pressure are constant (vessels open to the air), a\r\nsurface will represent a solution in equilibrium with only one solid phase;\r\na line, a solution with two solid phases, and a point, one in equilibrium\r\nwith three solid phases.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 124.]\r\n\r\nExample.--As an example of the complete isothermal diagram, there may be\r\ngiven one representing the equilibria in the system composed of water and\r\nthe reciprocal salt-pair sodium sulphate--potassium chloride for the\r\ntemperature 0deg (Fig. 124).[387] The amounts of the different salts are\r\nmeasured along the four axes, and the composition of the solution is {317}\r\nexpressed in equivalent gram-molecules per 1000 gram-molecules of\r\nwater.[388]\r\n\r\nThe outline of this figure represents four ternary solutions in which the\r\ncomponent salts have a common acid or basic constituent; viz. sodium\r\nchloride--sodium sulphate, sodium sulphate--potassium sulphate, potassium\r\nsulphate--potassium chloride, potassium chloride--sodium chloride. These\r\nfour sets of curves are therefore similar to those discussed in the\r\nprevious chapter. In the case of sodium and potassium sulphate, a double\r\nsalt, _glaserite_ [K_{3}Na(SO_{4})_{2}] is formed. Whether glaserite is\r\nreally a definite compound or not is still a matter of doubt, since\r\nisomorphic mixtures of Na_{2}SO_{4} and K_{2}SO_{4} have been obtained.\r\nAccording to van't Hoff and Barscholl,[389] glaserite is an isomorphous\r\nmixture; but Gossner[390] considers it to be a definite compound having the\r\nformula K_{3}Na(SO_{4})_{2}. Points VIII. and IX. represent solutions\r\nsaturated with respect to glaserite and sodium sulphate, and glaserite and\r\npotassium sulphate respectively.\r\n\r\nThe lines which pass inwards from these boundary curves represent solutions\r\ncontaining three salts, but in contact with only two solid phases; and the\r\npoints where three lines meet, or where three fields meet, represent\r\nsolutions in equilibrium with three solid phases; with the phases, namely,\r\nbelonging to the three concurrent fields.\r\n\r\nIf it is desired to represent a solution containing the salts say in the\r\nproportions, 51Na_{2}Cl_{2}, 9.5K_{2}Cl_{2}, 3.5K_{2}SO_{4}, the difficulty\r\nis met with that two of the salts, sodium chloride and potassium sulphate,\r\nlie on opposite axes. To overcome this difficulty the difference 51 - 3.5 =\r\n47.5 is taken and measured off along the sodium chloride axis; and the\r\nsolution is therefore represented by the point 47.5Na_{2}Cl_{2},\r\n9.5K_{2}Cl_{2}. In order, therefore, to find the amount of potassium\r\nsulphate present {318} from such a diagram, it is necessary to know the\r\ntotal number of salt molecules in the solution. When this is known, it is\r\nonly necessary to subtract from it the sum of the molecules of sodium and\r\npotassium chloride, and the result is equal to twice the number of\r\npotassium sulphate molecules. Thus, in the above example, the total number\r\nof salt molecules is 64. The number of molecules of sodium and potassium\r\nchloride is 57; 64 - 57 = 7, and therefore the number of potassium sulphate\r\nmolecules is 3.5.\r\n\r\nAnother method of representation employed is to indicate the amounts of\r\nonly two of the salts in a plane diagram, and to measure off the total\r\nnumber of molecules along a vertical axis. In this way a solid model is\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\nThe numerical data from which Fig. 124 was constructed are contained in the\r\nfollowing table, which gives the composition of the different solutions at\r\n0deg:--[391]\r\n\r\n  ----------------------------------------\r\n         |                               |\r\n         |                               |\r\n  Point. |       Solid phases.           |\r\n         |                               |\r\n  ----------------------------------------\r\n      I. | NaCl                          |\r\n         |                               |\r\n     II. | KCl                           |\r\n         |                               |\r\n    III. | Na_{2}SO_{4},10H_{2}O         |\r\n         |                               |\r\n     IV. | K_{2}SO_{4}                   |\r\n         |                               |\r\n      V. | NaCl; KCl                     |\r\n         |                               |\r\n     VI. | NaCl; Na_{2}SO_{4},10H_{2}O   |\r\n         |                               |\r\n    VII. | KCl; K_{2}SO_{4}              |\r\n         |                               |\r\n   VIII. |{ Glaserite;                  }|\r\n         |{ Na_{2}SO_{4},10H_{2}O       }|\r\n         |                               |\r\n     IX. |  Glaserite; K_{2}SO_{4}       |\r\n         |                               |\r\n      X. |{ Na_{2}SO_{4},10H_{2}O; KCl; }|\r\n         |{ NaCl                        }|\r\n         |                               |\r\n     XI. |{ Na_{2}SO_{4},10H_{2}O; KCl; }|\r\n         |{ glaserite                   }|\r\n         |                               |\r\n    XII. |  K_{2}SO_{4}; KCl; glaserite  |\r\n  ----------------------------------------\r\n  [Transcriber's note: table continued below...]\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n   Composition of solution in gram-mols.                       | Total\r\n   per 1000 gram-mols. water.                                  | number\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------| of salt\r\n   Na_{2}Cl_{2}. | K_{2}Cl_{2}. | Na_{2}SO_{4}. | K_{2}SO_{4}. | molecules.\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n        55       |      --      |      --       |      --      |   55\r\n                 |              |               |              |\r\n         --      |     34.5     |      --       |      --      |   34.5\r\n                 |              |               |              |\r\n         --      |      --      |      6        |      --      |    6\r\n                 |              |               |              |\r\n         --      |      --      |      --       |      9       |    9\r\n                 |              |               |              |\r\n        46.5     |     12.5     |      --       |      --      |   59\r\n                 |              |               |              |\r\n        47.5     |      --      |      8        |      --      |   55.5\r\n                 |              |               |              |\r\n         --      |     34.5     |      --       |      1       |   35.5\r\n                 |              |               |              |\r\n         --      |      --      |     10        |     10       |   20\r\n                 |              |               |              |\r\n                 |              |               |              |\r\n         --      |      --      |      7.5      |     10       |   17.5\r\n                 |              |               |              |\r\n        51       |      9.5     |      --       |      3.5     |   64\r\n                 |              |               |              |\r\n                 |              |               |              |\r\n        40.5     |     13       |      --       |      3.5     |   57\r\n                 |              |               |              |\r\n                 |              |               |              |\r\n        18       |     23       |      --       |      3       |   44\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nFrom the aspect of these diagrams the conditions under which the salts can\r\ncoexist can be read at a glance. Thus, {319} for example, Fig. 124 shows\r\nthat at 0deg Glauber's salt and potassium chloride can exist together with\r\nsolution; namely, in contact with solutions having the composition X--XI.\r\nThis temperature must therefore be below the transition point of this\r\nsalt-pair (p. 314). On raising the temperature to 4.4deg, it is found that\r\nthe curve VIII.--XI. moves so that the point XI. coincides with point X. At\r\nthis point, therefore, there will be _four_ concurrent fields, viz.\r\nGlauber's salt, potassium chloride, glaserite, and sodium chloride. But\r\nthese four salts can coexist with solution only at the transition point; so\r\nthat 4.4deg is the transition temperature of the salt-pair: Glauber's\r\nsalt--potassium chloride. At higher temperatures the line VIII.--XI. moves\r\nstill further to the left, so that the field for Glauber's salt becomes\r\nentirely separated from the field for potassium chloride. This shows that\r\nat temperatures above the transition point the salt-pair Glauber's\r\nsalt--potassium chloride cannot coexist in presence of solution.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 125.]\r\n\r\nIf it is only desired to indicate the mutual relationships of the different\r\ncomponents and the conditions for their coexistence (_paragenesis_), a\r\nsimpler diagram than Fig. 124 can be employed. Thus if the boundary curves\r\nof Fig. 124 are so drawn that they cut one another at right angles, a\r\nfigure such as Fig. 125 is obtained, the Roman numerals here corresponding\r\nwith those in Fig. 124.\r\n\r\nAmmonia-Soda Process.--One of the most important applications of the Phase\r\nRule to systems of four components with reciprocal salt-pairs has recently\r\nbeen made by Fedotieff[392] in his investigations of the conditions for the\r\nformation of sodium carbonate by the so-called ammonia-soda (Solvay) {320}\r\nprocess.[393] This process consists, as is well known, in passing carbon\r\ndioxide through a solution of common salt saturated with ammonia.\r\n\r\nWhatever differences of detail there may be in the process as carried out\r\nin different manufactories, the reaction which forms the basis of the\r\nprocess is that represented by the equation\r\n\r\n  NaCl + NH_{4}HCO_{3} = NaHCO_{3} + NH_{4}Cl\r\n\r\nWe are dealing here, therefore, with reciprocal salt-pairs, the behaviour\r\nof which has just been discussed in the preceding pages. The present case\r\nis, however, simpler than that of the salt-pair Na_{2}SO_{4}.10H_{2}O +\r\nKCl, inasmuch as under the conditions of experiment neither hydrates nor\r\ndouble salts are formed. Since the study of the reaction is rendered more\r\ndifficult on account of the fact that ammonium bicarbonate in solution,\r\nwhen under atmospheric pressure, undergoes decomposition at temperatures\r\nabove 15deg, this temperature was the one chosen for the detailed\r\ninvestigation of the conditions of equilibrium. Since, further, it has been\r\nshown by Bodlaender[394] that the bicarbonates possess a definite\r\nsolubility only when the pressure of carbon dioxide in the solution has a\r\ndefinite value, the measurements were carried out in solutions saturated\r\nwith this gas. This, however, does not constitute another component,\r\nbecause we have made the restriction that the sum of the partial pressures\r\nof carbon dioxide and water vapour is equal to 1 atmosphere. The\r\nconcentration of the carbon dioxide is, therefore, not independently\r\nvariable (p. 10).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 126.]\r\n\r\nIn order to obtain the data necessary for a discussion of the conditions of\r\nsoda formation by the ammonia-soda process, solubility determinations with\r\nthe four salts, NaCl, NH_{4}Cl, NH_{4}HCO_{3}, and NaHCO_{3} were made,\r\nfirst with the single salts and then {321} with the salts in pairs. The\r\nresults obtained are represented graphically in Fig. 126, which is an\r\nisothermal diagram similar to that given by Fig. 124. The points I., II.,\r\nIII., IV., represent the composition of solutions in equilibrium with two\r\nsolid salts. We have, however, seen (p. 314) that the transition point,\r\nwhen the experiment is carried out under constant pressure (atmospheric\r\npressure), is the point of intersection of four solubility curves, each of\r\nwhich represents the composition of solutions in equilibrium with three\r\nsalts, viz. one of the reciprocal salt-pairs along with a third salt.\r\nSince, now, it was found that the stable salt-pair at temperatures between\r\n0deg and 30deg is sodium bicarbonate and ammonium chloride, determinations\r\nwere made of the composition of solutions in equilibrium with NaHCO_{3} +\r\nNH_{4}Cl + NH_{4}HCO_{3} and with NaHCO_{3} + NH_{4}Cl + NaCl as solid\r\nphases. Under the {322} conditions of experiment (temperature = 15deg)\r\nsodium chloride and ammonium bicarbonate cannot coexist in contact with\r\nsolution. These determinations gave the data necessary for the construction\r\nof the complete isothermal diagram (Fig. 127). The most important of these\r\ndata are given in the following table (temperature, 15deg):--\r\n\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n         |                  | Composition of the solution in gram-molecules\r\n         |                  | to 1000 gram-molecules\r\n  Point. |  Solid phases.   | of water.\r\n         |                  |----------------------------------------------\r\n         |                  | NaHCO_{3} | NaCl | NH_{4}HCO_{3} | NH_{4}Cl\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n   --    | NaHCO_{3}        |    1.08   |  --  |       --      |     --\r\n   --    | NaCl             |     --    | 6.12 |       --      |     --\r\n   --    | NH_{4}HCO_{3}    |     --    |  --  |      2.36     |     --\r\n   --    | NH_{4}Cl         |     --    |  --  |       --      |    6.64\r\n   I.    | NaHCO_{3}; NaCl  |    0.12   | 6.06 |       --      |     --\r\n   II.   | NaCl; NH_{4}Cl   |     --    | 4.55 |       --      |    3.72\r\n   III.  | NH_{4}Cl;        |     --    |  --  |      0.81     |    6.40\r\n         | NH_{4}HCO_{3}    |           |      |               |\r\n   IV.   | NaHCO_{3};       |    0.71   |  --  |      2.16     |     --\r\n         | NH_{4}HCO_{3}    |           |      |               |\r\n   P_{1} | NaHCO_{3};       |    0.93   | 0.51 |       --      |    6.28\r\n         | NH_{4}HCO_{3};   |           |      |               |\r\n         | NH_{4}Cl         |           |      |               |\r\n   P_{2} | NaHCO_{3};       |    0.18   | 4.44 |       --      |    3.73\r\n         | NaCl; NH_{4}Cl   |           |      |               |\r\n  -------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nWith reference to the solution represented by the point P_{1}, it may be\r\nremarked that it is an incongruently saturated solution (p. 279). If sodium\r\nchloride is added to this solution, the composition of the latter undergoes\r\nchange; and if a sufficient amount of the salt is added, the solution P_{2}\r\nis obtained.\r\n\r\nTurning now to the practical application of the data so obtained, consider\r\nfirst what is the influence of concentration on the yield of soda. Since\r\nthe reaction consists essentially in a double decomposition between sodium\r\nchloride and ammonium bicarbonate, then, after the deposition of the sodium\r\nbicarbonate, we obtain a solution containing sodium chloride, ammonium\r\nchloride, and sodium bicarbonate. In order to ascertain to what extent the\r\nsodium chloride has been converted into solid sodium bicarbonate, it is\r\nnecessary to examine the composition of the solution which is obtained\r\n{323} with definite amounts of sodium chloride and ammonium bicarbonate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 127.]\r\n\r\nConsider, in the first place, the solutions represented by the curve\r\nP_{2}P_{1}. With the help of this curve we can state the conditions under\r\nwhich a solution, saturated for ammonium chloride, is obtained, after\r\ndeposition of sodium bicarbonate. In the following table the composition of\r\nthe solutions is given which are obtained with different initial amounts of\r\nsodium chloride and ammonium bicarbonate. The last two columns give the\r\npercentage amount of the sodium used, which is deposited as solid sodium\r\nbicarbonate (U_{Na}); and likewise the percentage amount of ammonium\r\nbicarbonate which is usefully converted into sodium bicarbonate, that is to\r\nsay, the amount of the radical HCO_{3} deposited (U_{NH_{4}}):-- {324}\r\n\r\n  ------+---------------------+\r\n        |Initial composition  |\r\n        |of the solutions:    |\r\n        |grams of salt to 1000|\r\n  Point.|grams of water.      |\r\n        +------+--------------+\r\n        | NaCl | NH_{4}HCO_{3}|\r\n  ------+------+--------------+\r\n  P_{2} | 479  |     295      |\r\n  --    | 448  |     360      |\r\n  --    | 417  |     431      |\r\n  P_{1} | 397  |     496      |\r\n  ------+------+--------------+\r\n  [Transcriber's note: table continued below...]\r\n  +----------------------------------+---------+----------\r\n  |                                  |         |\r\n  |Composition of solutions obtained:|         |\r\n  |gram-equivalents per 1000 grams   |U_{Na}   |U_{NH_{4}}\r\n  |of water.                         |per cent.|per cent.\r\n  +----------+------+------+---------+         |\r\n  |  HCO_{3} |  Cl  |  Na  | NH_{4}  |         |\r\n  +----------+------+------+---------+---------+----------\r\n  |   0.18   | 8.17 | 4.62 |  3.73   |  43.4   |   95.1\r\n  |   0.31   | 7.65 | 3.39 |  4.56   |  55.7   |   93.4\r\n  |   0.51   | 7.13 | 2.19 |  5.45   |  69.2   |   90.5\r\n  |   0.92   | 6.79 | 1.44 |  6.28   |  78.8   |   85.1\r\n  +----------+------+------+---------+---------+----------\r\n\r\nThis table shows that the greater the excess of sodium chloride, the\r\ngreater is the percentage utilization of ammonia (Point P_{2}); and the\r\nmore the amount of sodium chloride decreases, the greater is the percentage\r\namount of sodium chloride converted into bicarbonate. In the latter case,\r\nhowever, the percentage utilization of the ammonium bicarbonate decreases;\r\nthat is to say, less sodium bicarbonate is deposited, or more of it remains\r\nin solution.\r\n\r\nConsider, in the same manner, the relations for solutions represented by\r\nthe curve P_{2}IV, which gives the composition of solutions saturated with\r\nrespect to sodium bicarbonate and ammonium bicarbonate.

So far as the efficient\r\nconversion of the sodium is concerned, we see that it reaches its maximum\r\nat the point P_{1}, and that it decreases both with increase and with\r\ndecrease of the relative amount of sodium chloride employed; and faster,\r\nindeed, in the former than in the latter case. On the other hand, the\r\neffective transformation of the ammonium bicarbonate reaches its maximum at\r\nthe point P_{2}, and diminishes with increase in the relative amount of\r\nammonium bicarbonate employed. Since sodium chloride is, in comparison with\r\nammonia--even when this is regenerated--a cheap material, it is evidently\r\nmore advantageous to work with solutions which are relatively rich in\r\nsodium chloride (solutions represented by the curve P_{1}P_{2}). This fact\r\nhas also been established empirically.\r\n\r\nWhen, as is the case in industrial practice, we are dealing with solutions\r\nwhich are saturated not for two salts but only for sodium bicarbonate, it\r\nis evident that we have then to do with solutions the composition of which\r\nis represented by points in the area P_{1}P_{2}I,IV. Since in the\r\ncommercial manufacture, the aim must be to obtain as complete a utilization\r\nof the materials as possible, the solutions employed industrially must lie\r\nin the neighbourhood of the curves P_{2}P_{1}IV, as is indicated by the\r\nshaded portion in Fig. 127. The best results, from the manufacturer's\r\nstandpoint, will be obtained, as already stated, when the composition of\r\nthe solutions approaches that given by a point on the curve P_{2}P_{1}.\r\nConsidered from the chemical standpoint, the results of the experiments\r\nlead to the conclusion that the Solvay process, _i.e._ passage of carbon\r\ndioxide through a solution of sodium chloride saturated with ammonia, is\r\nnot so good as the newer method of Schloesing, which consists in bringing\r\ntogether sodium chloride and ammonium bicarbonate with water.[395]\r\n\r\n{326}\r\n\r\nPreparation of Barium Nitrite.--Mention may also be made here of the\r\npreparation of barium nitrite by double decomposition of barium chloride\r\nand sodium nitrite.[396]\r\n\r\nThe reaction with which we are dealing here is represented by the equation\r\n\r\n  BaCl_{2} + 2NaNO_{2} = 2NaCl + Ba(NO_{2})_{2}\r\n\r\nIt was found that at the ordinary temperature NaCl and Ba(NO_{2})_{2} form\r\nthe stable salt-pair. If, therefore, barium chloride and sodium nitrite are\r\nbrought together with an amount of water insufficient for complete\r\nsolution, transformation to the stable salt-pair occurs, and sodium\r\nchloride and barium nitrite are deposited. When, however, a stable\r\nsalt-pair is in its transition interval (p. 315), a third salt--in this\r\ncase barium chloride--will be deposited, as we have already learned. On\r\nbringing barium chloride and sodium nitrite together with water, therefore,\r\nthree solid phases are obtained, viz. BaCl_{2}, NaCl, Ba(NO_{2})_{2}. These\r\nthree phases, together with solution and vapour, constitute a univariant\r\nsystem, so that at each temperature the composition of the solution must be\r\nconstant.\r\n\r\nWitt and Ludwig found that the presence of solid barium chloride can be\r\nprevented by adding an excess of sodium nitrite, as can be readily foreseen\r\nfrom what has been said. Since the solution in presence of the three solid\r\nphases must have a definite composition at a definite temperature, the\r\naddition of sodium nitrite to the solution must have, as its consequence,\r\nthe solution of an equivalent amount of barium chloride, and the deposition\r\nof an equivalent amount of sodium chloride and barium nitrite. By\r\nsufficient addition of sodium nitrite, the complete disappearance of the\r\nsolid barium chloride can be effected, and there will remain only the\r\nstable salt-pair sodium chloride and barium nitrite. As was pointed out by\r\nMeyerhoffer, however, the disappearance of the barium chloride is effected,\r\nnot by a change in the {327} composition of the solution, but by the\r\nnecessity for the composition of the solution remaining constant.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 128.]\r\n\r\nBarium Carbonate and Potassium Sulphate.--As has been found by\r\nMeyerhoffer,[397] these two salts form the stable pair, not only at the\r\nordinary temperature, but also at the melting point. For the ordinary\r\ntemperatures this was proved in the following manner: A solution with the\r\nsolid phases K_{2}SO_{4} and K_{2}CO_{3}.2H_{2}O in excess can only coexist\r\nin contact either with BaCO_{3} or with BaSO_{4}, since, evidently, in one\r\nof the two groups the stable system must be present. Two solutions were\r\nprepared, each with excess of K_{2}SO_{4} + K_{2}CO_{3}.2H_{2}O, {328} and\r\nto one was added BaCO_{3} and to the other BaSO_{4}. After stirring for a\r\nfew days, the barium sulphate was completely transformed to BaCO_{3},\r\nwhereas the barium carbonate remained unchanged. Consequently, BaCO_{3} +\r\nK_{2}SO_{4} + K_{2}CO_{3}.2H_{2}O is stable, and, therefore, so also is\r\nBaCO_{3} + K_{2}SO_{4}. That BaCO_{3} + K_{2}SO_{4} is the stable pair also\r\nat the melting point was proved by a special analytical method which allows\r\nof the detection of K_{2}CO_{3} in a mixture of the four solid salts. This\r\nanalysis showed that a mixture of BaCO_{3} + K_{2}SO_{4}, after being fused\r\nand allowed to solidify, contains only small amounts of K_{2}CO_{3}; and\r\nthis is due entirely to the fact that BaCO_{3} + K_{2}SO_{4} on fusion\r\ndeposits a little BaSO_{4}, thereby giving rise at the same time to the\r\nseparation of an equivalent amount of K_{2}CO_{3}.\r\n\r\nThe different solubilities are shown in Fig. 128. In this diagram the\r\nsolubility of the two barium salts has been neglected. A is the solubility\r\nof K_{2}CO_{3}.2H_{2}O; addition of BaCO_{3} does not alter this. B is the\r\nsolubility of K_{2}CO_{3}.2H_{2}O + K_{2}SO_{4} + BaCO_{3}. A and B almost\r\ncoincide, since the potassium sulphate is very slightly soluble in the\r\nconcentrated solution of potassium carbonate. D gives the concentration of\r\nthe solution in equilibrium with K_{2}SO_{4} + BaSO_{4}. The most\r\ninteresting point is C. This solution is obtained by adding a small\r\nquantity of water to BaCO_{3} + K_{2}SO_{4}, whereupon, being in the\r\ntransition interval, BaSO_{4} separates out and an equivalent amount of\r\nK_{2}CO_{3} goes into solution. C is the end point of the curve CO, which\r\nis called the Guldberg-Waage curve, because these investigators determined\r\nseveral points on it.\r\n\r\nIn their experiments, Guldberg and Waage found the ratio K_{2}CO_{3} :\r\nK_{2}SO_{4} in solution to be constant and equal to 4. This result is,\r\nhowever, not exact, for the curve CO is not a straight line, as it should\r\nbe if the above ratio were constant; but it is concave to the abscissa\r\naxis, and more so at lower than at higher temperatures.\r\n\r\nThe following table refers to the temperature of 25deg.

In any given case it is sometimes possible to employ more\r\nthan one method, but all are not equally suitable, and the values of the\r\ntransition point obtained by the different methods are not always\r\nidentical. Indeed, a difference of several degrees in the value found may\r\nquite well occur.[398] In each case, therefore, some care must be taken to\r\nselect the method most suitable for the purpose.\r\n\r\nI. The Dilatometric Method.--Since, in the majority of cases,\r\ntransformation at the transition point is accompanied by an appreciable\r\nchange of volume, it is only necessary to ascertain the temperature at\r\nwhich this change of volume occurs, in order to determine the transition\r\npoint. For this purpose the _dilatometer_ is employed, an apparatus which\r\nconsists of a bulb with capillary tube attached, and which constitutes a\r\nsort of large thermometer (Fig. 129). Some of the substance to be examined\r\nis passed into the bulb A through the tube B, which is then sealed off. The\r\nrest of the bulb and a small portion of the capillary tube is then filled\r\nwith some liquid, which, of course, must be without chemical action on the\r\nsubstance under investigation. A liquid, however, may be employed which\r\ndissolves the substance, for, as we have seen (p. 70), the transformation\r\nat the transition point is, as a rule, accelerated by the presence of a\r\nsolvent. On the other hand, the liquid must not dissolve in the substance\r\nunder examination, for the temperature of transformation would be thereby\r\naltered.\r\n\r\n{331}\r\n\r\nIn using the dilatometer, two methods of procedure may be followed.\r\nAccording to the first method, the dilatometer containing the form stable\r\nat lower temperatures is placed in a thermostat, maintained at a constant\r\ntemperature, until it has taken the temperature of the bath. The height of\r\nthe meniscus is then read on a millimetre scale attached to the capillary.\r\nThe temperature of the thermostat is then raised degree by degree, and the\r\nheight of the meniscus at each point ascertained. If, now, no change takes\r\nplace in the solid, the expansion will be practically uniform, or the rise\r\nin the level of the meniscus per degree of temperature will be practically\r\nthe same at the different temperatures, as represented diagrammatically by\r\nthe line AB in Fig. 130. On passing through the transition point, however,\r\nthere will be a more or less sudden increase in the rise of the meniscus\r\nper degree (line BC) if the specific volume of the form stable at higher\r\ntemperatures is greater than that of the original modification; thereafter,\r\nthe expansion will again be uniform (line CD). Similarly, on cooling,\r\ncontraction will at first be uniform and then at the transition point there\r\nwill be a relatively large diminution of volume.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 129.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 130.]\r\n\r\nIf, now, transformation occurred immediately the transition point was\r\nreached, the sudden expansion and contraction would take place at the same\r\ntemperature. It is, however, generally found that there is a lag, and that\r\nwith rising temperature the relatively large expansion does not take place\r\nuntil a temperature somewhat higher than the transition point; and with\r\nfalling temperature the contraction occurs at a temperature somewhat below\r\nthe transition point. This is represented in Fig. 130 by the lines BC and\r\nEF. The amount of lag will vary from case to case, and will {332} also\r\ndepend on the length of time during which the dilatometer is maintained at\r\nconstant temperature.\r\n\r\nAs an example, there may be given the results obtained in the determination\r\nof the transition point at which sodium sulphate and magnesium sulphate\r\nform astracanite (p. 268).[399] The dilatometer was charged with a mixture\r\nof the two sulphates.\r\n\r\n  --------------------------------------------------------\r\n  Temperature. | Level of oil in capillary. | Rise per 1deg.\r\n  --------------------------------------------------------\r\n    15.6deg    |            134             |\r\n    16.6deg    |            141             |       7\r\n    17.6deg    |            148             |       7\r\n    18.6deg    |            154             |       6\r\n    19.6deg    |            161             |       7\r\n    20.6deg    |            168             |       7\r\n    21.6deg    |            241             |      73\r\n    22.6deg    |            243             |       2\r\n    23.6deg    |            251             |       8\r\n    24.6deg    |            259             |       8\r\n  --------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe transition point, therefore, lies about 21.6deg (p. 268).\r\n\r\nThe second method of manipulation depends on the fact that, while above or\r\nbelow the transition point transformation of one form into the other can\r\ntake place, at the transition point the two forms undergo no change. The\r\nbulb of the dilatometer is, therefore, charged with a mixture of the stable\r\nand metastable forms and a suitable liquid, and is then immersed in a bath\r\nat constant temperature. After the temperature of the bath has been\r\nacquired, readings of the height of the meniscus are made from time to time\r\nto ascertain whether expansion or contraction occurs. If expansion is\r\nfound, the temperature of the thermostat is altered until a temperature is\r\nobtained at which a gradual contraction takes place. The transition point\r\nmust then lie between these two temperatures; and by repeating the\r\ndeterminations it will be possible to reduce the difference between the\r\ntemperatures at which expansion and contraction take place to, say, 1deg,\r\nand to fix the temperature of the transition point, therefore, to within\r\nhalf a degree. By this method the transition point, for example, of sulphur\r\nwas found to be 95.6deg under a pressure of 4 atm.[400] The following are\r\nthe figures obtained by Reicher, who used a mixture {333} of 1 part of\r\ncarbon disulphide (solvent for sulphur) and 5 parts of turpentine as the\r\nmeasuring liquid.\r\n\r\n  TEMPERATURE 95.1deg.\r\n\r\n  -----------------------------------\r\n  Time in minutes. | Level of liquid.\r\n  -----------------------------------\r\n          5        |      343.5\r\n         30        |      340.5\r\n         55        |      335.75\r\n         65        |      333\r\n  -----------------------------------\r\n\r\n  TEMPERATURE 96.1deg.\r\n\r\n  -----------------------------------\r\n  Time in minutes. | Level of liquid.\r\n  -----------------------------------\r\n          5        |      342.75\r\n         30        |      354.75\r\n         55        |      360.5\r\n         60        |      361.5\r\n  -----------------------------------\r\n\r\n  TEMPERATURE 95.6deg.\r\n\r\n  -----------------------------------\r\n  Time in minutes. | Level of liquid.\r\n  -----------------------------------\r\n          5        |      368.75\r\n        100        |      368\r\n        110        |      368.75\r\n  -----------------------------------\r\n\r\nAt a temperature of 95.1deg there is a contraction, _i.e._ monoclinic\r\nsulphur passes into the rhombic, the specific volume of the former being\r\ngreater than that of the latter. At 96.1deg, however, there is expansion,\r\nshowing that at this temperature rhombic sulphur passes into monoclinic;\r\nwhile at 95.6deg there is neither expansion nor contraction. This is,\r\ntherefore, the transition temperature; and since the dilatometer was sealed\r\nup to prevent evaporation of the liquid, the pressure within it was 4 atm.\r\n\r\nII. Measurement of the Vapour Pressure.--In the preceding pages it has been\r\nseen repeatedly that the vapour pressures of the two systems undergoing\r\nreciprocal transformation become identical at the transition point (more\r\nstrictly, at the triple or {334} multiple point), and the latter can\r\ntherefore be determined by ascertaining the temperature at which this\r\nidentity of vapour pressure is established. The apparatus usually employed\r\nfor this purpose is the Bremer-Frowein tensimeter (p. 91).\r\n\r\nAlthough this method has not as yet been applied to systems of one\r\ncomponent, it has been used to a considerable extent in the case of systems\r\ncontaining water or other volatile component. An example of this has\r\nalready been given in Glauber's salt (p. 139).\r\n\r\nIII. Solubility Measurements.--The temperature of the transition point can\r\nalso be fixed by means of solubility measurements, for at that point the\r\nsolubility of the two systems becomes identical. Reference has already been\r\nmade to several cases in which this method was employed, _e.g._ ammonium\r\nnitrate (p. 112), Glauber's salt (p. 134), astracanite and sodium and\r\nmagnesium sulphates (p. 268).\r\n\r\nThe determinations of the solubility can be carried out in various ways.\r\nOne of the simplest methods, which also gives sufficiently accurate results\r\nwhen the temperature is not high or when the solvent is not very volatile,\r\ncan be carried out in the following manner. The solid substance is finely\r\npowdered (in order to accelerate the process of solution), and placed in\r\nsufficient quantity along with the solvent in a tube carefully closed by a\r\nglass stopper; the latter is protected by a rubber cap, such as a rubber\r\nfinger-stall. The tube is then rotated in a thermostat, the temperature of\r\nwhich does not vary more than one or two tenths of a degree, until\r\nsaturation is produced. The solution is withdrawn by means of a pipette to\r\nwhich a small glass tube, filled with cotton wool to act as a filter, is\r\nattached. The solution is then run into a weighing bottle, and weighed;\r\nafter which the amount of solid in solution is determined in a suitable\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nFor more accurate determinations of the solubility, especially when the\r\nsolvent is appreciably volatile at the temperature of experiment, other\r\nmethods are preferable. In Fig. 131 is shown the apparatus employed by H.\r\nGoldschmidt,[401] and used to a considerable extent in the laboratory of\r\nvan't Hoff. This consists essentially of three parts: _a_, a tube in which\r\nthe solvent and salt are placed; this is closed at the foot by an\r\nindia-rubber stopper. Through this stopper there passes the bent tube _cb_,\r\nwhich connects the tube _a_ with the weighing-tube d. At _c_ there is a\r\nplug of cotton wool. Tube _e_ is open to the air. The wider portion of the\r\ntube _cb_, which passes through the rubber stopper in _a_, can be closed by\r\na plug {335} attached to a glass rod _ff_, which passes up through a hollow\r\nWitt stirrer, _g_. After being fitted together, the whole apparatus is\r\nimmersed in the thermostat. After the solution has become saturated, the\r\nstopper of the bent tube is raised by means of the rod _ff_ and a\r\nsuction-pump attached to the end of e. The solution is thereby drawn into\r\nthe weighing-tube _d_, the undissolved salt being retained by the plug at\r\nc. The apparatus is then removed from the thermostat, tube _d_ detached and\r\nimmediately closed by a ground stopper. It is then carefully dried and\r\nweighed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 131.]\r\n\r\nAnother form of solubility vessel, due to Meyerhoffer and Saunders, is\r\nshown in Fig. 132.[402] This consists of a single tube, and the stirring is\r\neffected by means of a glass screw.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 132.]\r\n\r\nThe progress of the solution towards saturation can be very well tested by\r\ndetermining the density of the solution from time to {336} time. This is\r\nmost conveniently carried out by means of the pipette shown in Fig.\r\n133.[403] With this pipette the solution can not only be removed for\r\nweighing, but the volume can be determined at the same time. It consists of\r\nthe wide tube _a_, to which the graduated capillary _b_, furnished with a\r\ncap _c_, is attached. To the lower end of the pipette the tube _e_, with\r\nplug of cotton wool, can be fixed. After the pipette has been filled by\r\nsucking at the end of _b_, the stop-cock _d_ is closed and the cap _c_\r\nplaced on the capillary. The apparatus can then be weighed, and the volume\r\nof the solution be ascertained by means of the graduations.\r\n\r\nAs has already been insisted, particular care must be paid to the\r\ncharacterization of the solid in contact with the solution.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 133.]\r\n\r\nIV. Thermometric Method.--If a substance is heated, its temperature will\r\ngradually rise until the melting point is reached, and the temperature will\r\nthen remain constant until all the solid has passed into liquid. Similarly,\r\nif a substance which can undergo transformation is heated, the temperature\r\nwill rise until the transition point is reached, and will then remain\r\nconstant until complete transformation has taken place.\r\n\r\nThis method, it will be remembered, was employed by Richards for the\r\ndetermination of the transition point of sodium sulphate decahydrate\r\n(p. 136). The following figures give the results obtained by Meyerhoffer in\r\nthe case of the transformation:--\r\n\r\n  CuK_{2}Cl_{4},2H_{2}O <--> CuKCl_{3} + KCl + 2H_{2}O\r\n\r\nthe temperature being noted from minute to minute: 95deg, 93deg, 91.8deg,\r\n91.7deg, 92deg, 92.3deg, 92.4deg, 92.2deg, 92.2deg, 92deg, 90.5deg, 89deg,\r\nand then a rapid fall in the temperature. From this we see that the\r\ntransition point is about 92.2deg. It is also evident that a slight\r\nsupercooling took place (91.7deg), owing to a delay in the transformation,\r\nbut that then the temperature rose to the transition point. This is\r\nanalogous to the supercooling of a liquid.\r\n\r\nA similar halt in the temperature would be observed on passing from lower\r\nto higher temperatures; but owing to a lag in the transformation, the same\r\ntemperature is not always obtained.\r\n\r\n{337}\r\n\r\nV. Optical Method.--The transition point can sometimes be determined by\r\nnoting the temperature at which some alteration in the appearance of the\r\nsubstance occurs, such as a change of colour or of the crystalline form.\r\nThus mercuric iodide changes colour from red to yellow, and the blue\r\nquadratic crystals of copper calcium acetate change, on passing the\r\ntransition point, into green rhombs of copper acetate and white needles of\r\ncalcium acetate (p. 260). Or again, changes in the double refraction of the\r\ncrystals may be also employed to ascertain the temperature of the\r\ntransition point. These changes are best observed by means of a microscope.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of regulating the temperature of the substance a small\r\ncopper air-bath is employed.[404]\r\n\r\nVI. Electrical Methods.--Electrical methods for the determination of the\r\ntransition point are of two kinds, based on measurements of conductivity or\r\nof electromotive force. Both methods are restricted in their application,\r\nbut where applicable give very exact results.\r\n\r\nThe former method, which has been employed in several cases, need not be\r\ndescribed here. The second method, however, is of considerable interest and\r\nimportance, and calls for special reference.[405]\r\n\r\nIf two pieces, say, of zinc, connected together by a conducting wire, are\r\nplaced in a solution of a zinc salt, _e.g._ zinc sulphate, the potential of\r\nthe two electrodes will be the same, and no current will be produced in the\r\nconnecting wire. If, however, the zinc electrodes are immersed in two\r\nsolutions of _different_ concentration contained in separate vessels, but\r\nplaced in connection with one another by means of a bent tube filled with a\r\nconducting solution, the potentials at the electrodes will no longer be the\r\nsame, and a current will now flow through the connecting wire. The\r\ndirection of this current _in the cell_ will be from the weaker to the more\r\nconcentrated solution.\r\n\r\nThe greater the difference in the concentration of the solutions with\r\nrespect to zinc, the greater will be the difference of the potential at the\r\ntwo electrodes, or the greater will be the E.M.F. of the cell. When the\r\nconcentration of the two solutions becomes the same, the E.M.F. will become\r\nzero, and no current will pass.\r\n\r\nIt will be understood now how this method can be made use of {338} for\r\ndetermining the transition point of a salt, when we bear in mind that at\r\nthe transition point the solubility of the two forms becomes identical.\r\nThus, for example, the transition point of zinc sulphate heptahydrate into\r\nhexahydrate could be determined in the following manner. Tube A (Fig. 134)\r\ncontains, say, a saturated solution of the heptahydrate along with some of\r\nthe solid salt; tube B, a saturated solution of the hexahydrate along with\r\nthe solid salt. The tube C is a connecting tube bent downwards so as to\r\nprevent the mixing of the solutions by convection currents. ZZ are two zinc\r\nelectrodes immersed in the solution; the cell is placed in a thermostat and\r\nthe zinc electrodes connected with a galvanometer. Since, now, at\r\ntemperatures below the transition point the solubility of the hexahydrate\r\n(the metastable form) is greater than that of the heptahydrate, a current\r\nwill be produced, flowing in the cell from heptahydrate to hexahydrate. As\r\nthe temperature is raised towards the transition point, the solubilities of\r\nthe two hydrates also approach, and the current produced will therefore\r\nbecome weaker, because the E.M.F. of the cell becomes less; and when the\r\ntransition point is attained, the E.M.F. becomes zero, and the current\r\nceases. If the temperature is raised above this, the solubility of the\r\nheptahydrate becomes greater than that of the hexahydrate, and a current\r\nwill again be produced, but in the opposite direction. By noting the\r\ntemperature, therefore, at which the current ceases, or the E.M.F. becomes\r\nzero, the transition temperature can be ascertained.[406]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 134.]\r\n\r\nIn the case just described, the electrodes consisted of the same metal as\r\nwas contained in the salt. But in some cases, _e.g._ sodium sulphate,\r\nelectrodes of the metal contained in the salt cannot be employed.\r\nNevertheless, the above electrical method can be used {339} even in those\r\ncases, if a suitable non-polarizable mercury electrode is employed.[407]\r\n\r\nAlthough, as we saw, no current was produced when two pieces of zinc were\r\nimmersed in the same solution of zinc salt, a current will be obtained if\r\ntwo different metals, or even two different modifications of the same\r\nmetal, are employed. Thus an E.M.F. will be established when electrodes of\r\ngrey and of white tin are immersed in the same solution of zinc salt, but\r\nat the transition point this E.M.F. will become zero. By this method Cohen\r\ndetermined the transition point of grey and white tin (p. 42).\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{340}\r\n\r\nNAME INDEX\r\n\r\n          A\r\n  Abegg, 52\r\n  Adriani, 186, 217, 220\r\n  Alexejeff, 97, 125\r\n  Allan, 298\r\n  Allen, L.

There is, however, no contradiction, because in the case\r\nof ammonium chloride the gaseous phase consists of ammonia and hydrogen\r\nchloride in equal proportions, and in adding ammonia or hydrogen chloride\r\nalone we are not adding the gaseous phase, but only a constituent of it.\r\nAddition of ammonia and hydrogen chloride together in the proportions in\r\nwhich they are combined to form ammonium chloride would cause no change in\r\nthe equilibrium.\r\n\r\n[14] The vapour pressure of water in small drops is greater than that of\r\nwater in mass, and the solubility of a solid is greater when in a state of\r\nfine subdivision than when in large pieces (_cf._ Hulett, _Zeitschr.\r\nphysikal.

If the compound is _completely\r\nundissociated_, even in the vapour phase, the two branches of the curve\r\nwill _intersect_, (_e.g._ pyridine and methyl iodide; Aten, _Versl. Konink.\r\nAkad. Wetensch. Amsterdam_, 1905, 13. 462). The smaller the degree of\r\ndissociation, therefore, the sharper will be the bend. (See Stortenbeker,\r\n_Zeitschr. physikal. Chem._, 1892, 10. 194.) From the extent of flattening\r\nof the curve, it is also possible, with some degree of approximation, to\r\ncalculate the degree of dissociation of the substance in the fused state.\r\n(See Roozeboom and Aten, _Zeitschr. physikal.

Chem._, 1888, 2. 450).\r\n\r\n[243] Since iodine monochloride in the liquid state is only very slightly\r\ndissociated, the bend at C is very sharp (see p. 147, footnote). See also\r\nthe investigation of the system pyridine and methyl iodide (Aten, _Versl.\r\nKonink. Akad. Wetensch.

In the present case, the _partial pressure_ of the iodine\r\nin the vapour will be lowered by addition of chlorine, but the _total\r\npressure_ is increased.\r\n\r\n[249] The diminution of volume is supposed to be carried out at constant\r\ntemperature. The pressure and the composition of the phases must,\r\ntherefore, remain unchanged, and only the relative amounts of these can\r\nundergo alteration.\r\n\r\n[250] At point _b_ the ratio of chlorine to iodine in the solution is less\r\nthan in the monochloride, so that by the separation of this the excess of\r\nchlorine yielded by the condensation of the vapour is removed.\r\n\r\n[251] Roozeboom, _Rec. trav. chim.

Wiener\r\nAkad._, 1902, 110. 908.\r\n\r\n[285] Reference may be made here to the term \"stability limit,\" introduced\r\nby Knorr (_Annalen_, 1896, 293. 88) to indicate that temperature above\r\nwhich liquefaction and isomeric change takes place. As employed by Knorr\r\nand others, the term does not appear to have a very precise meaning, since\r\nit is used to denote, not the temperature at which these changes can occur,\r\nbut the temperature at which the change is rapid (vide _Annalen_, 1896,\r\n293. 91; 1899, 306. 334); and the introduction of an indefinite velocity of\r\nchange renders the temperature of the stability limit also somewhat\r\nindefinite. The definiteness of the term is also not a little diminished by\r\nthe fact that the \"limit\" can be altered by means of catalytic agents.\r\nSince, as we have seen, the stable modification can always undergo isomeric\r\nchange and liquefy at temperatures above the natural freezing point, but\r\nnot below that point; and, further, the less stable modification can\r\nundergo isomeric transformation and liquefy at temperatures above the\r\neutectic point, but will not liquefy at temperatures below that; it seems\r\nto the author that it would be more precise to identify these two\r\npoints--the natural freezing point and the eutectic point--which are not\r\naltered by catalytic agents, with the \"stability limits\" of the stable and\r\nunstable modification respectively. A perfectly definite meaning would\r\nthereby be given to the term. In the case of those substances which do not\r\nundergo appreciable isomeric change at the temperature of the melting\r\npoint, the stability limits would be the points G and H, Fig. 60.\r\n\r\n[286] Cameron, _Journ.

Chem._, 1901, 39. 27, 34; van't Hoff, _Zur Bildung\r\nder ozeanischen Salzablagerungen_, I. p. 66--Brunswick, 1905). This salt is\r\nformed from magnesium chloride and calcium chloride at 22deg, in accordance\r\nwith the equation--\r\n\r\n  2MgCl_{2}.6H_{2}O + CaCl_{2}.6H_{2}O = Mg_{2}CaCl_{6}.12H_{2}O + 6H_{2}O\r\n\r\nIncrease of pressure raises the transition point, because the formation of\r\ntachydrite is accompanied by increase of volume; the elevation being\r\n0.016deg for an increase of pressure of 1 atm. The number calculated from\r\nthe theoretical formula (p. 57) is 0.013deg for 1 atm.\r\n\r\nIf one calculates the influence of the pressure of sea-water on the\r\ntemperature of formation of tachydrite (which is of interest on account of\r\nthe natural occurrence of this salt), it is found that a depth of water of\r\n1500 metres, exerting a pressure of 180 atm., would alter the temperature\r\nof formation of tachydrite by only 3deg. The effect is, therefore,\r\ncomparatively unimportant.\r\n\r\n[344] Roozeboom, _Zeitschr. physical. Chem._, 1887, 1. 227.\r\n\r\n[345] _Zeitschr. physical.

The investigation of the equilibria between reciprocal\r\nsalt-pairs alone (three-component systems) is of great importance for the\r\nartificial preparations of minerals, as also in analytical chemistry for\r\nthe proper understanding of the methods of conversion of insoluble systems\r\ninto soluble by fusion (see Meyerhoffer, _Zeitschr. physikal.
